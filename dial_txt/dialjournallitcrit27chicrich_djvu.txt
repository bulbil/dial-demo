" ' The Taming of the Jungle ' is one of the most striking books of Indian life that we have seen since Mr. 
Kipling produced his ' Plain Tales from the Hills,' and it does not suffer by comparison with the work that made 
Mr. Kipling famous. Indeed, if Dr. Doyle had been first in the field we venture to think that Mr. Kipling's work 
would have been adjudged less good than this later effort." New York Literature, 

" Dr. Doyle has arrived ' and Kipling has a worthy rival on his own ground." Philadelphia Press.

" Some of the stories are full of the despair that follows 
when love is not reciprocated, others are full of the madness 
of love. The bitter irony of fate seems to enter into nearly 
all of them. Hardly any of the stories are more than telling 
outlines, but their brightness, and the effective way in which 
the colors are washed in, give life and interest to every move- 
ment." Boston Herald.

ented young American. Most people are not aware of the 
thorough cosmopolitanism of New York, and do not realize 
that it has an artists' colony and life almost as picturesque as 
can be found in Paris. Mr. Chambers, who is an artist as well

the picture that he has drawn of this practically unknown 
life is vivid and fascinating in the extreme.

New York clubmen. A crack New York newspaper reporter

lectual struggle of these two men makes a plot as interesting 
as that of "The Leavenworth Case."

an attractive design, at the low price of 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 



AT THE COURT OF

"The Son of the Czar." 

The period of Russian history covered by Mr. Whishaw's 
book, while later than that of " The Son of the Czar," is no

great Empress and the peculiarities of her wretched husband 
afford excellent opportunities for one that writes with discre- 
tion as well as ingenuity.

THE CHICAGO SCHOOLS. 

There has been much discussion during the 
past month, voiced chiefly in the newspapers 
and in the meetings of various bodies interested 
in public education, of what has been somewhat 
sensationally termed a " crisis " in the school 
affairs of Chicago. An agitation of sentiment 
against the present management of the city 
educational system has been so sedulously stim- 
ulated by the busybodies that the resulting 
state of things may indeed be called serious, 
although not exactly in the sense intended by 
those who have brought it to pass. For a con- 
dition is certainly serious which makes it pos- 
sible that the unworthy influences which suc- 
ceeded, a few months ago, in defeating for the 
time being the important reforms proposed by 
the Chicago Educational Commission, should 
command any considerable following in such 
an attack as has just been made upon the policy 
of Superintendent Andrews. This attack has 
proceeded from motives so obviously preju- 
diced, and has been so utterly lacking in the 
elements of fairness and generosity, that we 
feel half-ashamed to dignify it by serious con- 
sideration. Perhaps it would be better to dis- 
miss it with some such phrase as that used by 
Schopenhauer, speaking of the metamorphosis 
of serious thought when transferred to " the 
narrow lodging and low roofing of the confined, 
contracted, thick-walled skull from which dull 
glances steal directed to personal ends." 

On the whole, however, it seems desirable to 
say something more than this, because preju- 
dices are active forces in the social organi- 
zation, and because interested activities are 
sometimes successful in disguising themselves 
under the garb of the fairest philanthropy. It 
is not easy to disengage from the tangled skein 
of rumor and recrimination the thread of any 
coherent argument, and the more one examines 
the charges brought against the present policy 
of school administration, the more bewildered 
one becomes at the infusion of personal feeling 
and the confusion of thought. As far, however, 
as any argument is discernible, it seems to be 
directed against two of the aims of Superin- 
tendent Andrews that of establishing a sys- 
tem of true executive control and responsibility, 



10 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



and that of raising the standard of efficiency 
and intellectual ability among the body of 
instructors and administrative officers. It 
would seem that a Superintendent who kept 
these aims in view should deserve and receive 
the heartiest support from all sections of the 
community. For the past score of years these 
aims have been set, by all the organs of serious 
educational opinion, foremost among those that 
should be worked for in the betterment of 
public school education. They have become 
the merest commonplaces of educational dis- 
cussion, and it is rather late in the day to be 
called upon to defend them anew. But such 
is the distorting power of prejudice over the 
simplest and clearest ideas, that the guarded an- 
nunciation of these aims by the present school 
administration has evoked an attack of the 
most violent nature, in which the plain promises 
of the Superintendent have been ignored, his 
motives impugned, and even (as in the case of 
the shameless resolutions of the Chicago Feder- 
ation of Labor) his personal character aspersed. 
An attack of this sort is sure in the end to 
defeat itself, but it is a sorry exhibition for the 
time being, and it calls for an indignant re- 
monstrance from all the friends of fair play. 

To take the first of the aims above men- 
tioned, the consensus of opinion to the effect 
that both power and responsibility should be 
centralized in the executive head of a city school 
system is such that the official who stands for 
this principle is backed by wellnigh all the 
educational authority worth taking into ac- 
count. This principle was properly made the 
foundation of the recommendations of the Chi- 
cago Educational Commission, and has been 
energetically maintained by Superintendent 
Andrews during the year of his incumbency. 
Those who have opposed it have brought no 
arguments to bear against it, but have sup- 
ported their contention by a plentiful use of 
invective, and of the catchwords that the dem- 
agogic spirit has ever at hand for these emer- 
gencies. Such words as "autocracy," * 4 tyr- 
anny," and despotism " have been freely used, 
and the magic word " democracy " has once 
more been worked into the service of the reac- 
tionary party. In the sense in which the 
phrase " democratic management " has been 
employed in this controversy, it seems to con- 
note a government of the schools by the meth- 
ods of the town-meeting, if not of the mob. 
Questions of educational policy should be de- 
cided by councils and committees instead of by 
a responsible officer, so that no individual shall 



be much to blame if a decision turns out unfor- 
tunately. No more vicious absurdity than this 
was ever put forward in the name of democ- 
racy, or sought to be engrafted upon a system 
of .schools. Its practical workings have recently 
appeared in the antics of certain of the teach- 
ers' organizations of Chicago. The methods 
of these bodies have resembled those of the 
trade union or the political caucus rather than 
those of the professional organization, and the 
situation they have been striving to create is 
one that would be simply intolerable were it to 
prevail. 

The second of the major aims put forward 
by the Educational Commission and the Super- 
intendent is that of securing a higher average 
of educational qualification than heretofore for 
the teachers and other officers of the schools. 
Now, the obvious way of doing this is to set a 
standard of some sort, and, since the large ma- 
jority of educated people get the beginnings of 
their culture in some institution of the higher 
learning, it is quite proper to require of candi- 
dates for positions such an education or its 
equivalent. What goes by the name of a " col- 
lege education " means very little in very many 
cases, but it at least affords a starting-point for 
a test. We think, however, that the willing- 
ness to accept an " equivalent " has not been 
sufficiently emphasized in the present case, and 
much irritation might have been avoided had 
the declaration been made without reserve that 
unquestionable intellectual equipment, however 
obtained, should be enough to qualify for any 
post whatsoever in the system. Hard-and-fast 
rules are to be avoided in such matters. We 
have only to reflect that a John Stuart Mill 
would be excluded from teaching by the " col- 
lege education " requirement, to realize the 
unwisdom of a too specific statement of quali- 
fications. 

This, however, is an aside, and does not 
touch the point mainly at issue, which is that of 
enlisting the highest obtainable scholarship in 
the work of teaching. The attempt to cripple 
Superintendent Andrews in this endeavor has 
been characterized by the use of the memor- 
able phrase " educational trust," and by a line 
of reasoning which is not parodied in the fol- 
lowing statement : President Harper of the 
University of Chicago was a member of the 
Commission which urged the need of higher 
qualifications for teachers. Superintendent 
Andrews was one of his old-time friends, and 
was brought to Chicago through his influence. 
These two then conspired to convert the public

THE DIAL 



ll 



school system of Chicago into an appendix to 
the University, and at the same time devised a 
sinister scheme whereby all the desirable posts 
in the city system were to be manned by grad- 
uates of the University. The conspirators were, 
moreover, being used as tools in a far-reaching 
plan of the " plutocracy " to get possession of 
the machinery of public education in the United 
States, in order that free discussion might be 
suppressed and the clutch of organized capital 
strengthened about the throats of the toiling 
masses. This, we repeat, is not parody, but the 
clearest exposition we know how to make of the 
theory of the " educational trust " as it has been 
set forth of late in connection with educational 
affairs in Chicago. False and even grotesque 
as they are, these charges, with others of like 
sort, and all that they imply, have been made 
seriously in the public press, and have influ- 
enced the opinions of thousands of unthinking 
people. We are inclined to believe that this 
monstrous explanation of what is, after all, the 
simple matter of an effort to elevate the stand- 
ard of the teaching profession in Chicago is 
nothing more than an inflated defence of what 
" The Educational Review " describes as " the 
detestable theory that one purpose of the pub- 
lic schools is to provide young women with 
'places' in which to earn a livelihood." To 
such a complexion is reduced, when we look 
the facts squarely in the face, all this pother 
about " discrimination " and the substitution 
of " monarchical " for " democratic " ideals. 

To the intelligent mind, of course, these wild 
and whirling words are simply amusing, and 
the tissue of actual fact about which they cling 
the merest cobweb obstruction of vision. The 
last thing in the world that capital is trying to 
do is to control the machinery of education. It 
is too busily occupied in its own work of self- 
protection to be concerned with so extraneous 
a matter. The University of Chicago has no 
other interest in the city school system than 
that of stimulating it to a more healthful activ- 
ity. And there is nothing in the course of 
Superintendent Andrews to indicate that he has 
any other object at heart than that of strength- 
ening the system under his charge by the 
application to its work of the most enlightened 
ideas and the recruiting of the most efficient 
co-laborers in this great service. He has been 
less than a year at his difficult task, and it is 
not yet time to demand results. But in the 
course of that year he has at least shown to all 
who have eyes to see, and who are in a position 
to take a disinterested view of his position, that 



he has his work earnestly at heart, and that he 
deserves from the whole community that cor- 
dial support with which the best elements of 
the community (including those that viewed his 
original appointment with some apprehension) 
have already expressed their recognition of the 
strength and the sincerity of his purpose. 



PL A YS AND PLAYERS OF A SEASON. 

Continuing our annual midsummer survey of 
the drama in Chicago,* we find that the season of 
1898-99 has not passed without leaving for our 
theatre-goers the memory of several noteworthy 
events. Those autocrats of the stage who live in 
New York and dominate theatrical affairs the 
country over, have seen fit to deny Chicago audi- 
ences the enjoyment of some of the novelties under 
their control, while at the same time two or three 
of the sensations with which they have afflicted us 
could much better have been spared ; and yet there 
has been no lack in standard attractions, excellent in 
quality and generally worthy of the patronage ac- 
corded them. 

Early in the season Mr. Gillette's ever-popular 
melodrama, ' b Secret Service," began a run of five 
weeks at Powers's Theatre, closing with the end of 
October. During this same month Mrs. Julia Mar- 
lowe-Taber was seen at the Columbia for two weeks 
in " The Countess Valeska," while Mdme. Modjeska 
appeared for three weeks at the Grand Opera House 
in " Canaille," " Magda," " Mary Stuart," and 
Shakespearian roles. Mr. Goodwin and Miss Elliott 
were at Powers's throughout November, presenting 
" Nathan Hale," though not continuously, during 
the month's engagement. Mrs. Fiske came to the 
Grand for two weeks in November, where she was 
seen in " Tess of the D'Urbervilles " and " Love 
Will Find a Way." The great novelty of the year 
was Mr. Mansfield's elaborate and finely artistic 
production of Rostand's " Cyrano de Bergerac," 
which won phenomenal success, holding the stage 
at the Grand Opera House for five weeks, Decem- 
ber 4 to January 7. For three weeks in December 
and January, Mr. Sothern was at Powers's Theatre 
in " The King's Musketeer," and in the latter part 
of January Mr. Hackett played a week's engage- 
ment at the Columbia in the dramatization of 
Anthony Hope's " Rupert of Hentzau." 

The last two weeks of February brought Miss 
Nethersole to Powers's where she appeared in "The 
Second Mrs. Tanqueray," " The Termagant," "Car- 
men," and " Canaille." She was followed by Miss 
Maude Adams in the dramatized version of Barrie's 
" The Little Minister " next to Mr. Mansfield's 
" Cyrano " the most popular attraction of the year. 
Miss Adams's engagement continued six weeks ; 
then followed the presentation of " Catherine," with

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



Miss Annie Russell in the rule, and afterwards the 
appearance of Mr. Drew in "The Liars." The 
month of April was also distinguished by Miss Julia 
Arthur's interpretation of "Juliet." In May, Mr. 
Frohman's Lyceum Theatre Company began at 
Powers's an important engagement of four weeks, 
their most important production being last season's 
Eastern success (new this year in Chicago), Mr. 
Pinero's pleasing comedy, "Trelawny of the Wells." 
Daring this month also Mr. Otis Skinner came to 
the Grand for a week in the old favorite, " Rose- 
mary." During the first week of June occurred the 
much advertised production of " Romeo and Juliet," 
at Powers's Theatre, with its expensive cast includ- 
ing Miss Adams, Mr. Faversham, and Mr. Hackett. 
A new play by Augustus Thomas, " Arizona," began 
on June 12, at the Grand, a run of indefinite 
length. 

This constitutes a rather notable list of attractions 
for the year just closing, more comfortably dis- 
tributed too than always happens. It should be 
mentioned also that during the season engagements 
have been played by a number of steady standbys, 
including Mr. Roland Reed, Mr. Sol Smith Russell, 
Mr. William Crane, Mr. Stuart Robson, Mr. Digby 
Bell, and Miss May Irwin, although the plays 
presented by these people were none of them sat- 
isfactory, while some proved most unfortunate fail- 
ures. 

One of the features of the season has been the 
series of popular successes at McVicker's Theatre, 
now under the management of Mr. Jacob Litt. The 
most important of these productions were " Shen- 
andoah," which ran for three weeks in November ; 
' The Prisoner of Zenda," which followed for two 
weeks ; " At Piney Ridge," one week ; " In Old 
Kentucky," two weeks ; and an elaborate staging 
of a new melodrama, " Sporting Life," which was 
played to crowded houses for twelve weeks, Febru- 
ary 19 to May 13. 

At the minor theatres, nothing noteworthy has 
occurred. Conventional melodrama has held the 
boards, with occasional allowances of farce-comedy. 
The Academy, Adelphi, Alhambra, and Lincoln 
opened in August with plays appropriately reflecting 
the national situation. " The Commodore " showed 
the gun-deck of a cruiser in action, special attention 
being called to the four-inch guns, very properly 
introduced thus to the realm of realistic drama. 
" For Liberty and Love " made good use of flash- 
light signals sent from a tower under fire of Spanish 
sharpshooters. Mr. Lincoln J. Carter's " Remem- 
ber the Maine " was one of the new productions. 
"Cuba's Vow" and "Heroes of '98" celebrated 
generally the recent war. As matter of fact, ex- 
cepting these, very few war-plays have been put 
upon the local stage, and only occasionally has a 
play like " Chattanooga," " Held by the Enemy," 
or '> The Girl I Left Behind Me " made its appeal 
to the military spirit of the multitude. One popu- 
lar melodrama, " Devil's Island," has utilized the 
very natural material of the Dreyfus affair. 



In the presentation of Shakespearian plays, the 
falling off from the record of previous years is 
startling, although some of the causes are not far 
to seek. Mr. Thomas Keene and Miss Margaret 
Mather are no longer living. Mr. Mansfield has 
been sufficiently employed upon his splendid pro- 
duction of Cyrano "; Mrs. Marlowe-Taber has 
been busy with experiments in modern drama ; Miss 
Rehan and Mr. Walker Whiteside we have not seen. 
Mr. Warde and Mr. James, and Mr. Otis Skinner 
as well, have found it safer not to attempt " revivals " 
which prove too costly for many successive seasons. 
Who is left? In reality, there is but one, so far as 
we at present are aware ; and but for the somewhat 
erratic course of two stellar bodies of lesser magni- 
tude, Mdme. Modjeska has ruled, solitary, queen of 
the tragic stage. 

During the season of 1895-96, thirteen of the 
Shakespearian plays were presented in Chicago ; 
the number of performances was eighty-eight. In 
1896-97 also, thirteen plays were given, sixty-eight 
performances in all. In 1897-98, ten were staged 
and the performances numbered fifty. During the 
season just ended, only four were produced, and 
the number of performances is twenty-eight.

THE WEST WIND. 



The pale-green poplars shimmer in the sun, 
And wave and rustle ; the dry grasses sway ; 
The oaks and eucalyptus far away 
Take up a moaning music one by one. 
Here from the shadows mark the tremor run 
Over the hillside to the mountains gray 
Dim gray and purple, moveless, only they 
Are silent in the West Wind's carillon. 
This is the bearer of all mysteries, 
Whose fleet-winged cohorts are the messengers 
Bringing o'er unseen mountains the dim roar 
And surge and glitter of what magic seas, 
The dream-spray dashing where upon the shore 
Are harps and timbrels and bright islanders.

NATURE-BOOKS FOR SUMMER OUTIXGS.* 

Popular interest in the subject of natural 
history must be on the increase, if the number 
and variety of recent books devoted to this 
subject can be taken as an index. Indeed, the 
introduction of nature-study in the grades of 
the public schools, and the growing attention 
paid to technical instruction in biology in our 
best high schools, must in time create and con- 
tinue a legitimate popular demand for trust- 
worthy and well-presented information on nat- 
ural history subjects by those who pursue these 
lines of study not as a vocation but as an avo- 
cation. Whatever the hobby be birds or 
butterflies, flowers or ferns the enthusiastic 
amateur may be sure of finding some helpful 
and reliable manual to stimulate his interest 
and guide his efforts. 

One of the most successful and attractive of 
these recent handbooks for nature study is Mrs. 
Frances Theodora Parsons's " How to Know 
the Ferns." From cover to index the book 
is tastefully and skilfully gotten up, and will 
prove to be a useful and satisfactory guide for 
those who go a-ferniug. An introductory chap- 
ter on ferns as a hobby is followed by a discus- 
sion of the seasons and situations in which ferns 
may be found, a brief illustrated explanation of 
the technical terms employed, and an account 
of the interesting life-cycle of the fern. The 
greater part of the book is taken up with the 
descriptions of the fifty-seven species found in 
the eastern United States. This is accom- 
plished with a minimum of technicalities and a

a most enticing introduction to these shy inhab-

thor evidently intends an intention deserving 
commendation that the ferns shall not suffer 
as a result of her efforts, for there is no chap- 
ter devoted to methods of collecting and pre- 
serving fern specimens. 

Two books upon flowers have appeared which 
differ widely in method, purpose, and execution. 
Miss Going's " Field, Forest, and Wayside 
Flowers " is a series of popular essays re- 
printed in large part from the New York " Even- 
ing Post " and the " Popular Science Monthly " 
on botanical subjects suggested by the wax- 
ing and waning of plant life through the chang- 
ing seasons of the year in the northeastern 
United States. The work contains, in very 
attractive form, much information concerning 
the adaptations, the structural peculiarities, the 
physiological activities and the oscological rela- 
tions of many of our common flowering plants. 
It is intended for general readers with little 
knowledge of technical terms, rather than for 
students afield, though the latter will find in 
its pages much that will lend zest to an outing 
among our flowers in their native haunts. It 
abounds in suggestions for observation lessons. 
The illustrations are abundant, those from pho- 
tographs being especially commendable ; but 
the original pen-and-ink sketches are faulty in 
execution, and suffer by contrast with the re- 
printed figures. 

Miss Lounsberry's " Guide to the Wild 
Flowers," on the other hand, is a field manual, 
a sort of a " royal road " to a quick and ready 
identification of our common and most striking 
flowering plants. In this book all principles 
of systematic classification usually found in 
botanical manuals are set aside, and the plants 
are listed according to their haunts and asso- 
ciates. Thus, we find grouped together the 
plants which grow in water, in dry soil, and so 
on. In place of keys for identification we find 
abundant and most excellent illustrations, many 
of them from paintings by Mrs. Rowan repro- 
duced here by the color-printing process. The 
descriptions are brief and simple, and are skil- 
fully arranged according to a simple system. 
The author has also given for each of the spe- 
cies a summary of the plant lore and the 
literary allusions appropriate to the flower. 
Teachers of nature work will find in this book 
much that is suggestive and helpful, and the

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



unscientific student of plants will find it a con- 
venient handbook. 

The " First Book of Birds," by Mrs. Olive 
Thome Miller, is the outgrowth of her experi- 
ence in talking to school children on birds and 
their ways. It is not so much a primer in 
ornithology as it is an appeal to the sympathy 
of children and an effort to interest them in 
the living bird " neither as a target nor as a 
producer of eggs, but as a fellow-creature whose 
acquaintance it would be pleasant to make." 
This is an excellent motive, and it is well sus- 
tained throughout the book. Perhaps for this 
reason we can ignore the feeling that at times 
the facts are put to a slight tension. 

The gentler sex has no monopoly on the 
authorship of science works of popular interest. 
" Every-day Butterflies," by Dr. Scudder, is a 
model work of its kind. From the pen of a 
specialist, the book is authoritative and will 
command the interest alike of the biologist and 
of the general reader. It is gratuitous to sug- 
gest that it is dignified in statement and free 
from the extravagances and ofttimes unwar- 
ranted inferences that occasionally appear in 
the work of those who do not speak from ful- 
ness of knowledge, but compile at random. It 
is a plain and simple story of the life-histories 
of sixty-two of our common butterflies, all of 
which are illustrated, either in color or by ex- 
cellent cuts. The species are discussed in the 
order of their appearance during the year, and 
the story of their fleeting lives is told with 
wonderful minuteness of detail and withal with 
charming simplicity and directness. Students 
of nature and teachers of nature work will find 
this book a mine of suggestive information, and 
one well fitted to impart the spirit of patient 
investigation and to inculcate the habit of keen 
observation. 

Mr. Howe in his " On the Birds' Highway " 
takes his readers afield on a series of ornitho- 
logical outings at various seasons of the year. 
One spends a charming winter's day among the 
birds on the sands of Ipswich, and another in 
the shadow of the Presidential Range. The 
shores of Rhode Island, the shadow of Wachu- 
sett, and the " Land of Norumbega " are also 
visited. We are introduced to summer birds, 
to the resorters along Atlantic beaches, and 
to the frequenters of the Adirondack in the 
early autumn. Indeed, the author seems to 
have made the rounds of most of the popular 
Eastern resorts. The essays are pervaded by 
a decided literary flavor, and finished with 
an artistic, and at times poetic, touch. The au- 



thor has caught the spirit of the forest and 
shore, and his chapters breathe the monotony 
as well as the variety of nature. The book is 
handsomely gotten up and the illustrations are 
a fitting complement to the artistic text.

SOME RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL.* 

" A Thousand Days in the Arctic," by Mr. 
Frederick G. Jackson, describing three years' 
residence and exploration in Franz-Josef Land, 
is a disappointing book. In fact, it is not a 
book at all, but a mere aggregate of material 
for a book, as diary, letters, reports, etc. We 
have a great many such entries as : " At 2 A. M. 
moderate north wind. At 4 A. M. strong north- 
east wind, increasing to fresh gale at noon and 
gradually decreasing and veering at 8 p. M. to 
moderate north wind." Or, " The mate came 
up to ask if I can let them have a little paraffin, 
as they have run out at the ship. I gave him 
ten gallons to go on with." If the nine hundred 
pages had been reduced to three hundred, and 
the material well written up in chapters on 
Polar Bears, Walrus, Sledging Journeys, etc., 
we should have had a travel book of the first 
class instead of a bare record without literary 
quality. Nor can we speak well for the man- 
ufacture of the book, it being a heavy, clumsy 
volume, with highly glazed paper. 

The most interesting episode in the work is 
the author's dramatic meeting with Nansen. 

" On our approaching each other, about three miles 
distant from the land, I saw a tall man on .*i-i, with 
roughly-made clothes, and an old felt hat on his head. 
He was covered with oil and grease, and black from 
head to foot. I at once concluded from his wearing ski 
that he was no English sailor, but that he must be a 
man from some Norwegian walrus sloop who had come 
to grief, and wintered somewhere on Franz-Josef Land 
in very rough circumstances. His hair was very long

and dirty, his complexion appeared to be fair, but dirt 
prevented me from being sure on the point, and his 
beard was straggly and dirty also. We shook hands 
heartily, and I expressed the greatest pleasure at seeing 
him. I inquired if he had a ship. No,' he replied, 
' my ship is not here,' rather sadly I thought, and 
then he remarked, in reply to my question, that he had 
only one companion, who was at the floe edge. It then 
struck me that his features, in spite of the black grease 
and long hair and beard, resembled Nansen, whom I 
had met once in London before he started in 1893, and 
I exclaimed, Are n't you Nansen ? ' to which he re- 
plied, 'Yes, I am Nansen.' With much heartiness I 
shook him warmly by the hand and said, ' By Jove, I 'm 

d d glad to see you,' and congratulated him on his 

safe arrival. Then I inquired, Where have you come 
from ? ' He gave me a brief sketch of what had oc- 
curred, and replied, ' I left the " Fram " in 84 north lat- 
itude and 102 east longitude after drifting for two years, 
and I reached the 86 15' parallel, and I have now 
come here." 

Mr. Jackson had much experience with bears 
and walrus, and mentions some observations of 
interest, for instance, of a walrus lying on 
his back, digging through the ice with his tusks. 
Ponies were found useful in the sledge jour- 
neys, and one pony even learned to eat bear- 
meat with relish. The scientific results of the 
expedition were considerable, and to some ex- 
tent are embodied in the appendices. The 
maps are good, the photographic illustrations 
only fair. 

Mr. Frederick Palmer's " In the Klondyke " 
is a lively, sketchy, well illustrated book, de- 
scribing a trip made in the spring of 1898, 
during the great rush, when thirty-five thousand 
pilgrims poured into the Klondyke. The ex- 
citing pioneer life, with its vast variety of char- 
acters, is very cleverly drawn. The first boat 
into Dawson had a cargo of two hundred dozen 
eggs, for which the dealer, " a proud Seattle- 
ite," received $3,600 in less than an hour after 
he had landed. 

" Those of the crowd who could afford it hurried off 
to the restaurant for a ' squar ' ' composed entirely of 
' ham and.' The others, having to bide their time until 
luxuries were cheaper, found compensation in the items 

of news which were passed from tongue to tongue, 

for it had not occurred to the Seattleite to bring a 
newspaper with him. Thought there was more money 
in eggs,' was his aggravating explanation. 'Sposed you 
fellers wanted to eat, not to read.' As he had heard it, 
within a week after the declaration of war with Spain, 
the cruiser "New York," Captain Evans in command, 
had reduced the fortifications of Havana in three hours. 
The second Cheechawko to arrive assured us that this 
was quite untrue, and that two of Admiral Sampson's 
squadron had been sunk and the Spaniards were win- 
ning on every hand. The crowd refused to believe any- 
thing of the kind, and the second Cheechawko received 
only $14. a dozen for his eggs. With the next boat 
came a single newspaper, soiled with bacon grease. A 



curbstone speculator bought it for fifteen dollars, stuffed 
it instantly into his inside coat pocket, and a few min- 
utes later was posting signs to the effect that all might 
hear the news of Admiral Dewey's victory read by pay- 
ing a dollar apiece that evening. His entertainment 
would have netted him twice as much as it did if more 
than three hundred and fifty people could have been 
packed in the hall in which it was held. Some of the 
wealthy men considered this proceeding an outrage on 
personal liberty, and made it a point to buy between 
them any single copy of a paper later than any others 
that had arrived and have it read at once in the streets." 

We find in this book a very readable and ap- 
parently accurate account of the trails, of Daw- 
son and its life, of miners and mining, and of 
government and its policy, as they were in the 
spring and summer of 1898. 

" Highways and Byways in Donegal and 
Antrim," by Mr. Stephen Gwynn, is a pleas- 
antly written guide-book, from a cyclist point 
of view, to the northwestern Irish coast, " from 
the wildest corners of the West, where Irish 
is still the language even of trade, business, 
and schools, into the very neighborhood of 
prosperous, commercial, up-to-date Belfast." 
As seeking to lure the visitor to this part of 
Ireland, it must be pronounced successful. It 
contains much on the history and customs of 
the people, and throws light on the peasantry 
past and present. One important recommend- 
ation is worth quoting for the benefit of tour- 
ists everywhere. 

" There is one point which every Irishman writing a 
book for Englishmen in his country would wish to im- 
press, and that is to beg that tourists will not spoil the 
countryside by indiscriminate generosity. Killarney 
with its swarming beggars is an awful example. Even 
on the Antrim Coast small boys pursue the car or bicy- 
cle clamoring for pennies, and expect, on the beaten 
line of travel, to be paid for telling you the way. In 
Donegal happily none of these things exist." 

The numerous drawings by Mr. Hugh Thom- 
son are good, and a refreshing change from 
the inartistic photographic illustrations now so 
common. 

Mr. Keginald St. Barbe's little book " In 
Modern Spain " is a series of slight impression- 
ist sketches on such topics as the Prado, 
" Manana," Bull-fights, Village Fiesta, Spanish 
Newspapers in the War, etc. They well con- 
vey the spirit of the country, and are pleas- 
antly written. 

" Across India at the Dawn of the Twentieth 
Century," by Miss Lucy E. Guinness, is a very 
ardent missionary book by one of the most 
noted of English evangelists. We have glimpses 
of mission work as seen in a three months' tour 
through the principal missionary centres, and 



16 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



there is a summary, gleaned from various 
sources, for the empire as a whole, making a 
very popular and vigorous sketch. It is illus- 
trated with many diagrams and photographic 
pictures. 

Another missionary book is " In Afric's 
Forest and Jungle," by Mr. R. II. Stone. It is 
largely concerned with the appearance of the 
country and people, and with native wars in 
the section of Africa between the Bight of 
Benin and the Niger River. Here is a lively 
description of a party < > F Kroos : 

" The Kroos live almost entirely on rice, and the quan- 
tity they can eat at a single sitting is quite incredible. 
I once saw a party take breakfast and I never shall 
forget the incident. Several Kroos formed a circle 
around a vessel full of steaming hot rice. The leader 
pot in his hand, took a quantity, tossed it over and over 
until it assumed the form of a ball about the size of a 
baseball and then pitched it into his widely distended 
mouth. As he was swallowing the mass he gave bis 
body a snake-like squirm so as to leave as much space 
as possible for more to follow. All the others of the 
party followed the example of their leader, going round 
and round with clock-like regularity until the rice was 
all gone. By this time their stomachs were distended 
like those of cattle in early summer." 

This book is a simple, direct account, and 
touches on some points not often mentioned by 
other writers. 

" From Sea to Sea," by Rudyard Kipling, is 
a resuscitation of letters of travel on India, 
Burmah, China, Japan, and America. Mr. 
Kipling prefaces this book with the remark 
that he has been forced to collect these news- 
paper letters of 1887 to 1889 " by the enter- 
prise of various publishers, who, not content 
with disinterring old newspaper work from the 
decent seclusion of the office files, have in sev- 
eral instances seen fit to embellish it with addi- 
tions and interpolations." This purely com- 
mercial remark rather prejudices the critic at 
the start ; and we regret that the impression is 
confirmed by perusal. These letters are quite 
too journalistic, crude, smart, and diffuse to 
warrant taking any place in the acknowledged 
works of Rudyard Kipling. We quote this 
paragraph (a fair sample) on Chicago : 

" I have struck a city, a real city, and they call 
it Chicago. The other places do not count. San Francisco 
is a pleasure resort as well as a city, and Salt Lake was 
a phenomenon. This place is the first American city I 
have encountered. It holds rather more than a million 
people with bodies, and stands on the same sort of soil 
as Calcutta. Having seen it, I urgently desire never to 
see it again. It is inhabited by savages. Its water is 
the water of the Hngli, and its air is dirt. Also it says 
that it is the < boss ' town of America."

THE GENTLE AKT OF GARDENING.* 

From Abel to Virgil, and from Virgil to the 
present time, that branch of human endeavor which 
the encyclopaedias style " Gardening ; see Horticul- 
ture " has been held in high favor among gods and 
men. If it is to the sturdier elder brother, Agri- 
culture, that we owe the staff of life and the few- 
score plants which afford us most of our sustenance, 
such joys as the strawberry and the prettily deli- 
cious family of small fruits, the herbs that lend 
flavor to life, and the trees, shrubs, and flowers that 
blossom within our days, are all within the province 
of the gardener as Miss Gertrude Jekyll practices 
the gentle art. Though her admirable book, Wood 
and Garden," lacks the literary charm that apper- 
tains to " Oar Gardens " as seen by her distin- 
guished co-laborer, the Very Reverend S. Reynolds 
Hole, dean of Rochester, it is none the less a book 
with a distinction and fascination of its own. 

One of the things assuredly the chief thing 
which distinguishes the work of Miss Jekyll from 
all of its kind is the attention she has paid to that 
lost sister among the seven, the sense of smell. 
Physiologists like Mr. Havelock Ellis would have 
us believe that woman is lacking in the useful and 
neglected faculty of discerning and discriminating 
odors. But if this be true, Miss Jekyll it is whose 
exceptional gifts in this direction proved a rule to 
the contrary. " Passing upward through the copse," 
she writes of April, " the warm air draws a fra- 
grance almost as sweet, but infinitely more subtle 
[than that of sweetbriar], from the fresh green of 
the young birches ; it is like a distant whiff of lilies 
of the valley." There is not one man in a hundred 
who knows of the delicate scents from bourgeoning 
leafage in April, such odoriferous joys as inhere in 
the bursting shoots of the hackmatack or the great 
cotton woods. But Miss Jekyll has so far progressed 
in the art that she is able to devote a chapter, almost 
unique, to " The Scents of the Garden," beginning 
it with a sentence which has in it the root of the 
whole matter : " The sweet scents of a garden are 
by no means the least of its many delights." From 
this grows a most exquisite essay on smells that 
are not merely " sweet," but spicy, and suggestive, 
and balmy, and so near to stenches that no hard 
and fast line can be drawn ; for the connoisseurs 
in such matters know that distance and almost 
homoeopathic dilution can lend enchantment to 
carrion itself. This is true of some tropical plants : 
the tuberose in warmer countries, the jasmines and 
some of the lilies ; even, as is recorded here, the 
Balm of Gilead (Cedronella triphylla) in England, 
all hover over the dividing line between delight and 
disgust. It suffices, this interesting chapter, to call 
to mind the slender tributes brought by the poets

to a charming and sadly neglected source of pleas- 
ure and instruction. But it would be doing Miss 
Jekyll's volume an injustice to leave the impression 
that its excellence is all bound up in this nicety of 
olfactory discernment. The ancient question of art 
and nature crops out in dissertations scattered 
through the book on the possibilities of cultivation 
and domestication in detracting from as well as 
adding to the delights brought by flowers. The 
author shows more than one case of real degenera- 
tion, of colors made ugly and forms made uncouth 
by gardeners lacking in taste. There is, too, a most 
useful following of the plants from January through 
December, making one wish for such a climate as 
the south of England, where flowers out of doors 
are possible in each of the twelve months. 

If one looks to Dean Hole for a higher literary 
perfection in his amiable discourse upon " Our 
Gardens," one hardly expects at the same time to 
find a greater exhibition of technical knowledge 
than that displayed by his gentle fellow-author and 
fellow-enthusiast. But the versatile cleric proves 
himself no less adept in dealing with matters of 
somewhat recondite botany. Such a book for the 
gardener as Izaak Walton wrote for the fisherman 
or Gilbert White for the naturalist has yet to be 
written ; but something of the reward which will fall 
to the successful performer of this graceful task falls 
to Dean Hole here, as it has already fallen to Jef- 
frey in the matter of the field flowers. For his work 
teems with delicate scholarship, now Greek, now 
Latin, now a harking back to reproach Lord Baeon 
for what he did not know about gardening or to 
praise Addison for being in advance of his time, 
horticulturally speaking, and now citing the modern- 
est of instances in a manner he has made almost 
peculiar to himself, until the reader wonders if all 
cultivation, after all, does not come to the same 
thing, and culture and horticulture differ only as a 
part from the whole. " What is the garden for? " 
he asks a " middle-aged nymph," and she tells him : 
" For the soul, sir, for the soul of the poet ! For 
visions of the invisible, for grasping the intangible, 
for hearing the inaudible, for exaltations," and a 
page or two later there is a sigh for what might 
have befallen the dinner were the garden unknown : 
" No tomatoes for the soup, no cucumbers for the 
salmon, no new potatoes, no crisp salad, no mint 
sauce for the lamb, no peas for the duck, no apples 
for the goose, " proving the art to be not less 
worthy of the inner than the outer poet. 

It is summer now, when nature herself is supple- 
menting the plentiful illustrations of these two books 
in her own inimitable manner ; yet the volumes will 
furnish the letter-press for a better understanding 
of the part man plays when he leads with sympathy 
and reverence the footsteps of the Great Mother. 
And when the winter frosts have left us sighing anew 
for the climate of southern England, these pages will 
refresh the weariest with the thought of coming 

greenery and bloom.

RECENT FICTION.* 



It is now something like twelve years since a 
novel called " The New Antigone," published anony- 
mously, attracted widespread attention on account 
of its somewhat audacious treatment of the problem 
of love without legal sanction. When it transpired 
that the novel had been written by Dr. William 
Barry, a Catholic priest, it seemed still more remark- 
able, because clerical novelists, when they handle 
such subjects at all, are apt to do it gingerly, and 
with much parade of didacticism. But here was a 
clerical writer who frankly accepted the artistic 
rule of leaving the moral implicit, instead of forc- 
ing it upon the reader's attention. The moral was 
unquestionably there, but the book gave offense to 
too many people who would like to exclude certain 
subjects altogether from literary treatment. Now, 
after this long silence, we have a second novel, this 
time acknowledged, from the same hand. It is 
called " The Two Standards," a title suggested 
by the " Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius," and 
this is to be taken in the obvious sense. That is, 
the two ideals that struggle for the mastery over 
the two human souls in whom our interest chiefly 
centres are, on the one hand, the ideal of worldly 
prosperity and sensual gratification ; on the other,

the ideal of renunciation and spiritual triumph. 
The story reminds us not a little of " Evelyn 
Innes," although not brought to so conclusive a ter- 
mination. In both there is a woman tempted, and 
in both music is made the means of temptation. 
But in the cace of Dr. Barry's novel, we are left 
in no doubt whatever of the reality of the spiritual 
recoil of the heroine. ' The Two Standards " is an 
improvement upon " The New Antigone " in its 
strictly literary aspects, although it is still too rhe- 
torical, too overloaded with discursive reflection. 
We lose sight of the story for long periods, but it 
must be admitted that during these periods we have 
for recompense the constant contact with an acute 
and brilliant intellect For it is evident that the 
author's life has not been cloistered in any deaden- 
ing sense ; he has not lost sight of the intellectual 
and artistic currents of the age ; he has realized 
that the problems of life are to be faced and not 
ignored. In brief, the book has so many fine qual- 
ities that its technical shortcomings considered in 
the light of mere fiction do not impel us to deal 
with it harshly, or to make our final word anything 
but one of praise. 

It is a " Boheme " something like that of Henri 
Murger or as nearly like it as possible under mod- 
ern conditions into which we are taken by " The 
Rapin," a story by Mr. Henry De Vere Stacpoole. 
The chief variant from Murger's theme is that the 
hero is not naturalized in the Pays Latin, being 
rather an aristocratic youth of the Rive Droite who 
takes up his abode in Bohemia to escape from the 
emptiness of his former fashionable surroundings. 
How he lives there with Celestin, but wearies of that 
life no less than of the other, how he is bled by vari- 
ous sorts of parasites, how he discovers that he is an 
artist only in the flattering words of his interested 
followers, how Ce'lestin dies of pneumonia, and her 
lover goes back to conventionality, all these 
things, and many more, are told with much anima- 
tion and some humor in this book of " The Rapin." 
Some of the minor characters, too, are engagingly 
interesting Gaillard the poet, and the people 
whom he invents upon the spur of the moment, 
Pelisson the journalist, and Nani the vicious old 
roue who plays his patrons such tricks. As for the 
hero, who is called Toto, we will simply say that 
the name fits him like a glove. 

Mr. Merriman's novels have always reminded us 
of something vaguely familiar, but it was not until 
reading " Dross " the other day that the reminis 
cence took concrete shape. In the crisp precision 
of his manner, in his exhibition of the dry sort of 
intellectuality that never allows emotion to get the 
upper hand, in his display of wide interests and 
information, and, we must add, in his inability to 
sound more than half-way the depths of the soul 
he writes as does M. Cherbuliez, and makes to his 
readers much the same sort of appeal. " Dross," 
which is certainly as good as the best of his pre- 
vious work, is a novel of the annee terrible, although 
the sinister happenings of that period are kept well 



in the background, and serve but ax the framework 
for a tale of private life, suitably romantic, and 
waxing into melodrama for one brief hour. The 
author's characters are not all clearly realized, and 
his whole story is based upon a vast structural im- 
probability, but the management of it all is so 
ingenious, and the minor technique BO admirable, 
that it amply fulfils its promise made manifest in 
the opening pages, of an hour of exceptionally 
pleasant entertainment. 

One or two of his previous novels, " Derelicts " 
in particular, have accustomed us to expect good lit- 
erary workmanship from Mr. William J. Locke, 
and his new novel, called " Idols," brings with it 
no disappointment. Yet it does not seem to be of 
his very best, and its failure to reach his previous 
high standard is probably attributable to a resort 
to something suspiciously like melodrama, and his 
evident determination to create a startling situation, 
at whatever cost of probability. The woman who 
commits perjury to save a friend, and who at the 
same time deliberately assumes as far as the eye 
of the public is concerned the role of a dishon- 
ored wife, acts in a way that only casuistry can 
justify, and the purity of her motive cannot con- 
done the offense. Such is the substance of the 
tragic story that Mr. Locke has woven for us, and, 
interesting as it is, there is an ethically unwhole- 
some flavor that remains, while the interest fades 
in the memory. 

Dr. Conan Doyle must have great confidence in 
his public, judging from the experiments that he 
tries upon it from time to time. Since his deserved 
early successes in historical romance, he has pro- 
duced a series of books in various manners that 
were either confessed pot-boilers, and consequently 
calling for no serious consideration, or attempts to 
do things for which he had obviously no aptitude 
whatever. His latest book touches what we must 
believe to be the very bottom of the pit into which 
he has fallen. For absolute imbecility it would be 
hard to match a book of which the following extract 
is fairly illustrative : 

" For the underground railway is blessed as regards 
privacy above all other lines, and where could a loving 
couple be more happy who have been torn apart by 
cruel fate for seven long hours or so ? It was with a 
groan that Frank remarked that they had reached 
Mark Lane. 

" ' Bother ! ' said Maude, and wondered if there was 
any shop near where she could buy hairpins. As every 
lady knows or will know there is a very intimate con- 
nection between hairpins and a loviug husband." 

There are whole chapters of this maudlin drivel ; 
in fact, there is little else. The story is concerned 
with nothing under the sun but the courtship and 
early married life of two commonplace young peo- 
ple, described in the minutest detail. It should 
have appeared (and remained buried) in The 
Ladies' Home Journal." 

After this book, even Mr. Le Gallienne's " Young 
Lives," which is also concerned with the same cal-

low period in the development of its characters, 
seems fresh and delightful reading, although a nor- 
mal critical judgment would doubtless feel bound 
to bear down rather heavily upon its sentimental- 
ism and lack of any sort of virility. But there is 
a curious mixture of strength with weakness in this, 
as in the author's other books, and, unsatisfactory 
as it may be in some aspects, in others it compels 
our admiration for its delicacy and its insight. For 
example, it gives us such a glimpse as no writer 
could have imagined of the inner life of middle- 
class nonconformist society in Liverpool. The au- 
thor has clearly lived that life in his youth, and 
knows it from the inside. However, this is no new 
thing for readers of Mr. Le Gallienne's books, but 
merely the restatement of a familiar and redeeming 
quality. " Young Lives " is a pleasant little book, 
marred by but one very conspicuous fault of taste, 
which may be found in the chapter entitled " The 
Wits." Here the hero, a youth with aspirations 
toward literature, is introduced to a London gath- 
ering, among whom it is very easy to pick out cer- 
tain actual individuals. The " learned homunculus " 
is not difficult to identify, nor is the " short, firmly 
built clerkly fellow, with a head like a billiard-ball 
in need of a shave, a big brown moustache, and enor- 
mous spectacles." These things by themselves 
would not be so bad, but the author goes rather be- 
yond the limit when he brings himself into the com- 
pany with the following sentence : " There entered 
a tall young man with a long, thin face, curtained 
on either side with enormous masses of black hair, 
like a slip of the young moon glimmering through 
a pine-wood." Presently this " moon-in-the-pine- 
wood " apparition is contrasted with the billiard- 
headed and bespectacled individual in the following 
terms : " That is our young apostle of sentiment, 
our new man of feeling, the best-hated man we 
have ; and the other is our young apostle of blood. 
He is all for muscle and brutality and he makes all 
the money. . . . But my impression is that our 
young man of feeling will have his day, though 
he will have to wait for it." The naivete of this 
observation is so refreshing that one almost forgets 
that it should have been left to someone else to 
make. 

In " The Black Douglas," Mr. Crockett takes 
for his subject the fall of the great house that dom- 
inates the picturesque tradition of fifteenth century 
Scotland. He varies his theme, however, by intro- 
ducing the sinister figure of Gilles de Retz, and the 
latter half of the romance takes us to France and 
tells the grewsome story that Dumas has embodied 
in " Les Louves de Machecoul." There is no new 
thing in this romance, and no new manner ; the 
book is a typical example of Mr. Crockett's work- 
manship, exhibiting its virtues and its defects. 
Among the latter, garrulity has always been prom- 
inent, and in the present instance it seems to have 
grown upon the writer. 

We have previously expressed the opinion that 
Mr. S. R. Keightley was quite as ingenious as Mr. 



Weyman as an artificer of what has come to be of 
late years the popular sort of historical romance. 
This opinion is fortified by "The Silver Cross," 
which, if it be not quite equal to " The Cavaliers," 
is all that one could reasonably expect of such a 
book. The story is concerned with the intrigues 
of Madame de Chevreuse against Cardinal Maz- 
arin, and is packed with excitement of the most 
romantic sort. Books of this pattern are usually as 
much alike as so many peas, and the conventional 
pattern is followed by Mr. Keightley, but this is no 
reproach to a narrative that is so successful in pro- 
viding entertainment for its readers. 

Mr. Guy Boothby seems to have taken the hint 
that his public is a little tired of Dr. Nikola, and 
has ostensibly shelved that fiendish individual. Yet 
we cannot help feeling that it is the same malignant 
personality that lurks beneath the mask of Pharos 
the Egyptian in Mr. Boothby's new novel. Pharos, 
we learn, was master of the magicians at the court 
of the Pharoah of the Exodus, and found his arts 
pitted against those of Moses, much to his discom- 
fiture. In due time, he became a mummy, but he 
really did n't die at all, getting in some unexplained 
way a new frame in which to prowl about the world. 
Thus we are introduced to him in the nineteenth 
century, concerned with getting possession of his 
own mummy (which has been brought to England 
by an Egyptologist), and also with a diabolical 
scheme for getting even with mankind by infecting 
Europe with the plague. How he accomplishes 
these ends, making an English artist his unwitting 
accomplice, and how he finally dies (for good, let 
us hope), is told us in Mr. Boothby's romance, 
which finds no trick of sensationalism too cheap to 
be used, and which has not the slightest claim (any 
more than its predecessors) to be considered a lit- 
erary production. 

" The Enchanted Stone," by Mr. Lewis Hind, 
is another fantastic romance which brings the ancient 
Orient and the modern Occident into juxtaposition, 
just as Mr. Boothby does, only with greater inge- 
nuity and a finer sense of what is demanded by lit- 
erary art. The stone in question is a miraculous 
jewel that finds its way from India to England, and 
is tracked by an uncanny " yellow man " who sticks 
at nothing in bis efforts to regain possession of the 
talisman. Having done so, he takes advantage of 
the credulity of an eccentric and wealthy English- 
woman, and they proceed together to start a new 
religion, erecting for its service a temple of unex- 
ampled splendor upon the coast of Cornwall. The 
unsophisticated Cornishmen, looking upon the tem- 
ple with disfavor, organize a raid, and proceed to 
demolish it. The credulous Englishwoman dies, 
and the yellow man (with his jewel) escapes, pre- 
sumably to his own India. The story is one of the 
wildest of extravaganzas, yet it has a certain fas- 
cination, and even, in its earlier chapters, reminds 
us slightly of the " New Arabian Nights." 

Mr. E. F. Benson achieved so pronounced a suc- 
cess in " The Vintage " that he has done well to

write a second romance of the Greek Revolution. 
This new story is entitled "The Capsina," and is a 
sequel to the earlier one in that it continues the 
chronicle of the heroic cause for which Byron fought 
and Shelley sang. It also has for its hero the lit- 
tle Mitaos " of " The Vintage," who in this book 
takes to the sea, and proves himself no less a fighter 
there than on the land. Bat the interest in Mitaos 
ia overshadowed by that which we take in the hero- 
ine the Capsina for whom the book is named. 
This fine and inspired figure is a true creation, who 
in her glowing life and heroic death so compels our 
admiration that we are ready to overlook the defects 
of the work its occasional trivialities, longueurs, 
and confusions. 

" The Brothers of the People " is a romance of 
revolutionary Balkania, garnished with villainies, 
conspiracies, and bombs. A young English girl goes 
to the country to act as companion to the daughter 
of an influential statesman, and becomes mixed up 
in many affairs of which she had no anticipation 
when she accepted the position. The story is a com- 
bination of sentimentalism, improbability, and puer- 
ilily. entirely out of the reach of serious criticism. 

Mrs. Augustus Moore, who writes under the name 
of Martin J. Pritchard," is bent upon being start- 
ling, whatever the cost in probability and good taste. 
Her first novel, " Without Sin," told the story of a 
woman laboring under the singular delusion that 
she waa in very truth the reincarnation of the mother 
of God. Her second venture, "The Passion of 
Rosamund Keith," now before us, has for its climax 
the physical crucifixion of a woman by a mob of 
superstitious Albanian mountaineers. This scene 
cannot be described as other than revoltingly sensa- 
tional, yet it must be admitted that the book as a 
whole has literary quality beyond what is common 
in sensational and sentimental fiction. The writer 
has no mean powers of vivid delineation, applied to 
both scenes and situations, and the advance in crafts- 
manship over her earlier book is unquestionable. 
The plot hinges upon the love of Paul Carr for 
Rosamund Keith. This is at first crossed by a bit 
of scandal that any sensible lovers would have 
ignored, then Paul goea into a monastic retreat and 
joins the Catholic church, then he remembers the 
fact (strangely forgotten up to this moment) that he 
baa a divorced wife still living, and finally (for by 
such tortuous logic does the story proceed), his 
newly-made vows so weigh upon him that he deter- 
mines to renounce Rosamund. Thus far, the book 
ia a story of English society. It is only toward the 
close that the scene shifts to Eastern Europe, and 
we come to the startling episode already mentioned. 
It must be added that Paul's divorced wife dies 
moat conveniently, and that the literal " passion " of 
Rosamund does not terminate fatally. 

Curiously enough, the same problem of marriage 
with a man whose divorced wife is still living occu- 
pies the central place in Mrs. Wilfred Ward's "One 
Poor Scruple." The object of thia book, aside from 
the discussion of thia central problem, ia clearly to 



place before its readers a picture of everyday life in 
the Catholic households of English society, and to 
sketch society itself from the Catholic point of view. 
Were it not that Mrs. Ward speaks of her book aa 
having been in course of preparation for the past 
seven years, we should be tempted to speak of it as 
a studied attempt to counteract the effect of the 
latest novel of another and more famous Mrs. Ward 
that is, the effect of Helbeck of Banniadale." 
In a word, it presents what may be called the nor- 
mal type of English Catholicism, and thus stands in 
marked contrast to the striking, but surely abnormal, 
type in which Mrs. Humphry Ward so deeply en- 
gages our interest Viewed in relation to its central 
problem, " One Poor Scruple " is a story of sharp 
temptation and eventual spiritual triumph. Con- 
sidered aa an unpretentious delineation of social 
conditions, it is faithfully studied and deserving of 
every praise. Taken as a portrait gallery of many 
sorts and conditions of men and women, it achieves 
an unusual degree of success in its delineations. We 
get to know these people from the inside, although 
the external trick of manner is by no means ignored, 
and as we close the book, we feel that of its many 
admirable qualities this penetrative insight into 
character is the one that chiefly calls for praise. 

The romantic materials of Mrs. Crowninshield's 
Latitude 19 " are promising enough. The Island 
of Haiti in the twenties, the reign of terror estab- 
lished by Christophe the Caligula or Tiberius of 
the island the horrid mysteries of vuudou fetich- 
ism, the cannibalism of the natives, the buccaneers 
that infested the coast and made their lairs in its 
caves, all these things are exciting indeed, and when 
we bring a party of shipwrecked Yankees into such 
surroundings, we seem to have an embarrassment 
of riches. Unfortunately, the writer ia without the 
constructive skill needful for the shaping of a con- 
nected story out of these matters, and her book re- 
mains a congeries of imperfectly connected episodes, 
a jumble of excitements and terrors, a kaleidoscope 
of fantastic unrealities. 

The Espiritu Santo " of Miss Skinner, a daugh- 
ter of the author of " Two Years before the Mast," 
is a book about French, Spanish, and Italian people, 
mostly connected with the operatic stage, and about 
as unreal as attempts at characterization could 
easily be. They constantly express " such noble senti- 
ments " that the Marquis of Posa would have taken 
them to his heart, but they never impress us as being 
living people of flesh and blood. The religious 
feeling of the story is so tender and beautiful that 
we cannot speak of its spirit in terms of too cordial 
commendation, but the application of these terms 
must ceane with the spirit ; when we come to the 
execution of the book, considered simply as a novel, 
and not aa didacticiam or fine writing, it is impos- 
sible to call it anything but a failure. 

The peculiar charm of Mr. Howells when he is at 
his best reappears, after several recent eclipses, in 
the novel which he has fantastically styled " Ragged 
Lady." It ia a charm compounded of several ele-

ments, and not easy of analysis. It is not merely 
the quality of minute observation, tinged with lam- 
bent humor, because we find that in some of his 
least satisfactory performances. It is something 
beyond this, and in the present instance it is found, 
at least in part, in his recurrence to those Italian 
scenes which have before proved his best inspiration, 
and in still greater part to his gentle heroine, whose 
imperturbable spirit no splendors can dazzle and no 
vicissitudes can embitter. The placidity and sweet- 
ness of Clementina, the " ragged lady " of this tale, 
offers so refreshing a contrast to the high-strung and 
emotional heroines of so much of our fiction that we 
can be only grateful for the acquaintance, even if 
Clementina is a trifle anaemic, besides being afflicted 
at moments by an aggravated and distressing form 
of the celebrated New England conscience. Mr. 
Howells still likes to puzzle his readers by the play 
of elusive motives, and Clementina's several senti- 
mental entanglements come upon us as a series of 
imperfect surprises, causing us to observe her career 
with a certain zest, but not quite in accordance with 
the canons of clear-cut art. The minor figures in 
this gallery are also interesting, every one, from the 
Russian socialist to the Michigan parson, and their 
characters are drawn for us with touches that are 
as delicate as those of a Meissonier, and far more 
revealing withal. 

If California sends us many more such novels as 
" The Procession of Life," it will have to be reck- 
oned with in our literary geography more seriously 
than hitherto. The California once revealed to us 
by Mr. Bret Harte has passed so completely away 
from the actual world that the stories still written 
by him, in the seclusion of the Athenaeum Club, 
delightful as they are, must be described as the 
productions of a literary Rip Van Winkle, whose 
present is the remote past of everybody else. Since 
the Harte period of Californian society, so great an 
evolution has taken place that Mr. Vachell's novel 
seems to come from an entirely different world. It 
is a world that has not remained absolutely unre- 
vealed to us, for it has already lived a sort of lit- 
erary life in the brilliant crudity of Mrs. Atherton's 
novels, in the slighter and far more delicate work 
of Mrs. Graham, and, of course, in " Ramona." 
We have also been brought close to it by Mr. Van 
Dyke's " Millionaires of a Day," a book which, 
although not a novel, has a far greater interest than 
most fiction, and which is suggested by the new 
book now under consideration. The connecting 
link in this case is provided by the story of the 
"boom" that struck Southern California in the early 
eighties. The leading characters in Mr. Vachell's 
novel are made to pass through the storm and stress 
of that speculative period, to suffer in the swift reac- 
tion, and at last to share in the temperate prosperity 
of still more recent years. The book is rich in 
human interest, and is distinctly the best novel that 
has thus far been written of latter-day California. 

If drawing-rooms were the world, and those who 
have their being in them the whole of mankind, one 



could have no reasonable ground for dissatisfaction 
with the novels of Mr. Henry James. We certainly 
do get from his books about everything, in the way 
of both conversation and action, that a decorous 
drawing-room can shelter, and we get it in such 
delicate forms of artistic presentation that no pre- 
text is left us for adverse criticism. In " The Awk- 
ward Age," for example, than which even Mr. 
James has produced no better book, there are nearly 
five hundred pages of drawing-room talk and inci- 
dent, all delightfully finished and subtle, all dis- 
playing workmanship of the highest cherry-stone 
order, and yet we are inexpressibly wearied by it, 
because it has so little to do with anything that 
makes life really worth having, and we worry 
through it from a sense of duty rather than for sat- 
isfaction with its message. The outcome is naught, 
as far as we are able to discern, and not one ac- 
quaintance has been made with whom we would 
desire further commerce. 

It will be remembered that the death of Harold 
Frederic left among his manuscripts two unpub- 
lished novels, both dealing with English society. 
The first of them, which appeared promptly, was 
called " Gloria Mundi," and the best efforts of his 
friends to deal kindly with it could not conceal the 
fact that it was relatively a failure, and a failure pre- 
cisely because its author had gained only a superficial 
knowledge of the society which he sought to depict. 
His other posthumous novel, " The Market- Place," 
has now been published, and proves to be a far 
more satisfactory piece of work. The author is 
still clearly not at home in his new environment, 
but he has at least chosen a theme fairly within the 
reach of his intelligence. The business of company- 
promotion is comprehensible enough to an alert 
and clear-headed American writer, whether it be 
carried on in Wall Street or Capel Court, and 
this novel deals with the flotation of a Mexican 
rubber company by the devices made so familiar 
during the Hooley investigation of last year. The 
hero of this speculation is an Americanized English- 
man who plans his coup with Napoleonic strategy, 
and wins for himself a colossal fortune at the ex- 
pense of the " shorts," who have been tricked into 
selling shares of which he alone has absolute con- 
trol. When the settlement comes, they are bled 
white, and the buccaneer retires with his spoils. 
This is a very unconventional sort of morality, for 
the ethics of such a story are supposed to demand 
that the speculator shall be exposed and come to 
grief. Instead of this, our speculator covers up all 
the traces of his swindle, wins an aristocratic wife, 
and realizes his ambition of settling down as an 
English country gentleman. The moral that the 
author points is something quite different from what 
is expected, and we are by no means sure that it is 
not equally satisfactory. Certainly it is more subtle 
than the conventional moral, for it emphasizes the 
lesson that riches, however acquired, are a doubtful 
good to the man who is without inner resources to 
make possible their enjoyment. We leave him in

lion of all the externals of happiness, yet a

at least there is the negative satisfaction of know- 
ing that his wealth has been gained at the expense 
of men who deserve no sympathy, and the positive 
satisfaction of witnessing his achievement, under 
highly exciting and dramatic circumstances, of his 
purpose. The hook is not exactly fine, but it is 
unquestionably both strong and interesting.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

LtlUrt ^ The comely volume containing " The 

aidoWopmpAy Autobiography and Letters" (one- 
ojMrt. oilplant. f ourtn autobiography and three- 
fourths letters) of that worthy woman and gifted 
writer, Mrs. M. O. W. Oliphant, will appeal to a 
large circle of readers. Mrs. Harry Caghill is the 
editor, and she has done her work with due care and 
tact Mrs. Oliphant once described herself as " a 
writer very little given to explanations or to any 
personal appearance." Her work was for the pub- 
lic, her life for her family and chosen friends ; and 
when, toward the close of June, 1897, she lay dying 
in her sunny little home at Wimbledon, she laid 
upon those about her the injunction that no biogra- 
phy of her was to be written. Those familiar with 
Mrs. Oliphant's writings as a whole will have noted 
in some of the latest of them a certain tendency to 
depart from her habitual altitude of reserve. And 
that she realized that the biography she dreaded 
was in one form or another inevitable, and that no 
injunction she could lay on her friends would avail 
to baffle the public's desire to know something of 
the story of her life, is shown by the fact that long 
before her death she began to jot down at odd times 
scraps more or less autobiographical, to which were 
added, later, some account of her earliest years. 
Later still, at the request of her last surviving child, 
she continued this fragmentary memoir, bringing it 
down to the date at which her sons entered Oxford. 
These writings form the narrative portion of the 
volume now before us, and they have been supple- 
mented with the letters, which Mrs. Caghill has 
arranged in their chronological order, and connected 
with a thread of story where needed. It should be 
added that Mrs. Oliphant's wishes were not disre- 
garded in publishing this material. " She bade as," 
says Mrs. Caghill, " deal with it as we thought best." 
While Mrs. Oliphant's narrative is thoroughly read- 
able, and, in its light way, informing, it is the let- 
ters that form the more important and interesting 
portion of the volume. The largest part of these 
are to members of the Blackwood family, and they 
give an almost connected history of Mrs. Oliphant's 
work. Their general readableness, it must be owned, 
is not impaired by a certain note of asperity in the 
writer's tone when she is speaking of literary people. 
Even George Eliot (whom Mrs. Oliphant for a long 



time " cannot believe to be a woman ") does not 
quite escape. Macaulay is styled " the historian of 
sophistication, who writes only and always for so- 
ciety," whom "everybody admires," and in whom 
" nobody believes." As to Miss Martineau, Mrs. 
Oliphant is struck by "the curious limited folly of 
her apparent common-sense," and can only wonder 
how such a commonplace mind could have attained 
the literary position she did." In one letter to 
Mr. W. Blackwood, Mrs. Oliphant grimly expresses 
a wish to review Mr. Howells and certain other 
American writers, promising to do her best to put 
these Jacobs of literature on their true level." A 
note to Mr. Blackwood, from Oxford, comments 
amusingly on the tone of the town and its notabili- 
ties. The writer goes on to say : " Almost every- 
body who is anybody has called, I think ; but intel- 
lectualism, like every other ism, is monotonous, and 
the timidity and mutual alarm of the younger po- 
tentates strikes me a good deal. They are so much 
afraid of committing themselves or risking any- 
thing that may be found wanting in any minutiae of 
correctness. Scholarship is a sort of poison tree 
that kills everything." While the present volume 
is not, actually or ostensibly, a full and sufficient 
life of Mrs. Oliphant, it is fresh and entertaining, 
well leavened with 'personal comment and anecdote, 
and just the sort of biography one may venture upon 
with a light heart in the dog-days. There are two 
portraits, and there ought to have been an index.

It is with a sigh for hills and moun- 
tains that the dweller on the western 
prairie lays down Mr. John Cole- 
man Adams's " Nature Studies in Berkshire " (Put- 
nam), with its beautiful pictures of hill and dale, 
climbing road and falling meadow. The inevita- 
bility of the association of " flat " with " stale and 
unprofitable " is more apparent with the progress of 
every chapter, till the sigh that brought forth the 
hanging gardens of Babylon is repeated after many 
ages. So many American artists and poets have 
gone to these self-same scenes for inspiration, it is 
only wonderful that the pleasant duty of celebration 
which Mr. Adams has imposed upon himself should 
have been reserved for him by a kindly fate. And 
that the fate was kindly, for the reader no less than 
the writer, these pleasant pages tell. Western 
Massachusetts, the scene of Dr. Underwood's New 
England town, has long awaited the coming of some 
American Jeffrey, someone who should add to the 
love of wild nature and sympathy with all its phases 
the flavor of the children of the soil. Than Dr. 
Adams no one could be better fitted for the task, 
either by birth or nurture, and his book in informed 
with the spirit of the place and the spirit of the 
people of the place. A higher morality, the moral- 
ity of fitness, takes the place of too obvious preach- 
ing ; the contrasts of the external world find inter- 
pretation in the contrasts of words which bespeak 
wit ; the erudition of nature is interpreted by the

erudition of broad cultivation ; and the result is 
wholly pleasing. The very chapter titles prove it : 
"The Dome of the Taconics," " The Circumvention 
of Greylock," "The Social Flowers," "At the 
Sign of the Beautiful Star," "The Great Cloud 
Drive," all these and many more speak the thought 
of the lover and friend, who sets down a moment 
in literature, less enduring than the everlasting hills 
he writes of, but one which will make a lasting 
appeal nevertheless. " The hot and steaming city 
is leagues away," he tells us in one place. " All 
that is vanished ; and instead of it, a scene meets 
the eye in which one loses sense and thought in a 
sweet oblivion of content. . . . The air quivers and 
throbs over a rye-field. The far hills retreat still 
farther behind a blue haze. . . . Under the maples 
here in Berkshire is an incomparable vantage- 
ground from which to behold the glories of mid- 
summer as they pass by." This vantage-ground 
we do not begrudge the good Doctor, nor, since we 
may not share it, do we cease to be thankful for 
this reminiscence of it ; but we wish it were with 
us a personal memory, even as it is with him. For 
this new longing and aspiration in a life too short 
for the fulfilment of half the old ones, his graphic 
pages must be held responsible.

thor opens this preface with the following remarks : 
" The Japanese have a voluminous literature, ex- 
tending over twelve centuries, which to this day has 
been very imperfectly explored by European stu- 
dents. Forty years ago no Englishman had read 
a page of a Japanese book, and although some 
Continental scholars had a useful acquaintance with 
the language, their contributions to our knowledge 
are unimportant. . . . Beyond a few brief detached 
notices, there is no body of critical opinion on Jap- 
anese books in any European language." Mr. 
Aston's position in putting forth such a " body of 
critical opinion " is in one respect enviable. No 
reviewer is likely to assume the superior airs of his 
kind, and play the pedagogue with the author. The 
latter has things all his own way, and the former, 
however omniscient he may upon other occasions 
seem, is for once humbled. We can say nothing of 
this book beyond testifying to its thoroughly read- 
able character, which is largely due to the free use 
of translated passages, biographical notices, and 
historical data. In other words, the things that a 
reader would be expected to know beforehand in 
the case of a European literature could not possibly 
be expected of him in this case, and Mr. Aston has 
done well to keep this fact constantly in mind. As 
for the difficulties encountered in the translations, 
the following observations are much to the point : 
" The cherry is, in Japan, the queen of flowers, 
and is not valued for its fruit, while the rose is re- 
garded as a mere thorny bush. Valerian, which to 



us is suggestive principally of cats, takes the place 
of the rosebud as the recognized metaphor for the 
early bloom of womanhood." A still more curi- 
ous illustration of the vagaries of association is 
offered by " The Ladies of New Style," an advanced 
novel of to-day, in which the new woman heroine 
is a dairymaid, not, forsooth, to indicate pastoral 
simplicity, but rather the most advanced radicalism. 
" Formerly," we are told, " cow's milk was not 
used as food in Japan, and when this novel ap- 
peared (1887) none but a truly enlightened person 
would dare to affront the old-fashioned prejudices 
against it." We congratulate Mr. Aston upon the 
acceptable manner in which he has told us the long 
story of Japanese letters, and we certainly have no 
reason to doubt that he is as trustworthy an author- 
ity as he is an interesting historian. 

There were stirring times in Mis- 
Border fighting j in th ope ning months of the 

in the Civil War. . n - r 

great civil conflict of a generation 
ago. The history of the struggle to keep the Bor- 
der States in the Union is an interesting one, and 
one which is always told with intense emotions, be- 
cause brother rose against brother, and the feud-like 
character of the fighting was marked. But the 
great movements of later years obscured the fron- 
tier contests, and the historians have been accus- 
tomed to dismiss with a few paragraphs what Mr. 
Britton in his "Civil War on the Border" (Put- 
nam) describes with the detail of an eye-witness. 
The second volume of this work continues the tale 
of the activities of local militia in Missouri, Arkansas, 
Indian Territory, and Kansas, against the bands of 
guerrillas under such leaders as the infamous Quan- 
trill or the desperate bandit, Bill Anderson. General 
Sherman's oft-quoted words descriptive of war cer- 
tainly have apt illustration in the stories told in 
these volumes, and perhaps there can be no better 
preventive of internal commotions than the re- 
hearsal of the experiences of the frontier folk dur- 
ing the years when the armies of the two sections 
were fighting, now in the West and later in Vir- 
ginia, for the settlement of the great struggle. 
What the raids of the Tories were in days of the Rev- 
olution, the swift and awful descents of the bandits 
of the Western frontier were to the loyal people in 
days of the Rebellion. Possibly war cannot be 
refined, and yet it seems likely that the changes in 
American life during the last quarter of a century 
have made it impossible that our land should ever 
again witness such scenes as those described by 
writers about the border fights of the Civil War. 

Readers of Mr. John Davidson who 

A playwright remember with pleasure his '> Plays " 

and AM prologue. J 

of five years ago have probably by 
this time read his " Godfrida " (John Lane). Those 
who remember the " Plays " with only a confused 
feeling akin to anger, may have neglected the book. 
To these latter, however, we must recommend at 
least the Prologue, which will not trouble them long

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



It presents us with a conversation between the Poet 
himself and an Interviewer, and thus gives Mr. 
Davidson a chance to speak of his ideas and inten- 
tions. This we rather like. Probably every author 
has sometime had a vague feeling that be would 
like to write reviews explaining the point of his 
work, even if he has also had a counter feeling that 
his work ought to explain itself. Mr. Davidson's 
views are good. We like particularly his disclaimer 
of any attempt to revive the Jacobean drama or the 
Elizabethan eclogue, or to follow in the path of 
Ibsen, which last few would have supposed a temp- 
tation to him. We like, too, his view of Romance 
as the essence of Reality. Certainly the Prologue 
should find readers. And as to the play, well, it 
is impossible to say anything about Mr. Davidson's 
plays without explaining and arguing a good deal, and 
for that we have not now the time. Those who would 
like a dramatist to come to them with an amusing 
or even instructive tale will be disappointed. Those 
who are intoxicated at a snuff or two of the fresh 
air of poetry, or with the lifting now and then of 
the cloud that generally dulls our horizon, will be 
amply satisfied. Between these two groups is the 
great majority of readers of plays (like ourselves) 
who will find a good deal to like, and will yet wish 
that Mr. Davidson had a little more skill in getting 
his real conceptions to stand out clear of all inferior 
material. 

" Studies in the Psychology of Wo- 
man " (H. S. Stone & Co.) is a 
translation by Georgia A. Etchison, 
from the German of Laura Marholm. The author's 
object is to ascertain the causes of the present dis- 
satisfaction among women, and she announces her- 
self as one who has " sought to grasp the points of 
view and facts which are most affected by the social 
position of woman in the present and most recent 
past." The effort is sincere, but the result is a ram- 
bling and flighty little book, with no coherence or 
sustained argument. Like most books of its kind, 
it shows an empirical astuteness, and offers some 
interesting criticism ; but its touch is, as a rule, both 
clumsy and uncertain. In denunciation, it is at 
once vague and glaring ; its " practical " sugges- 
tions are indefinite ; and its main conclusion as to 
the destiny of woman is not at all different from 
that of the world in general. Altogether, there 
would seem no very good reason for not leaving it 
in its original German. 

During the World's Fair year, the 
first volume of a "History of the 
New World called America" ap- 
peared from the pen of Mr. E. J. Payne. It was 
in two " books," the one relating the story of the 
discovery, and the second beginning a study of the 
aboriginal conditions. The style of the work was 
pleasing, and many kind words were written regard- 
ing it. After an interval of six years the second 
volume is at hand, bringing the history down to 
the period of the conquest of Mexico and Peru by 



Th' \f,r World 
o/ America. 



the Spaniards. The ethnographic and linguistic 
characteristics of the aborigines are set forth with 
painstaking care, and many interesting matters are 
presented with minuteness of detail. Considering 
the eleven hundred pages thus far given to the New 
World, with hardly a beginning of the study of the 
effects produced upon the Old World by the discov- 
ery of this Western land, the question naturally 
arises : For what special constituency is the author 
writing? It is doubtful whether the average Amer- 
ican reader will care to go much further than the 
extremely interesting volumes of John Fiske on 
" The Discovery of America," and it likewise seems 
questionable whether there is a demand for a re- 
writing of the history of the New World in such an 
elaborate way as to require over a thousand pages 
of detail about the pre- historic days, or rather the 
pre-Columbian era, before the story of the Western 
hemisphere is interwoven with the movements in 
the Eastern which are of vastly more importance in 
a well-balanced account of American history. If, 
however, there is a constituency which seeks such 
elaboration, these volumes of Mr. Payne will prove 
satisfying. (Oxford University Press.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Teachers of the history of England will be grateful 
to Dr. Charles W. Colby, of McGill University, for his 
volume of " Selections from the Sources of English 
History" (Longmans). The selections average less 
than three pages each and number upwards of one hun- 
dred. They throw interesting side-lights upon the whole 
course of English history, from Julius Csesar to the 
Reform Bill, and are made with judicious care. The 
work is designed for a younger class of students than are 
aimed at by such publications as the " Select Charters " 
of Bishop Stubhs and the " Old South Leaflets," but no 
student can be too young to he taught the distinction 
between historical sources and historical compilations. 

Recent German text-books include the following: 
Freytag's " A us dem Jahrhundert ties Grossen Kriegis," 
edited by Dr. L. A. Rhodes; "Stille Wasser," stories 
from several writers, edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bern- 
hardt; and " Eingeschneit," by Emil Frommel, also 
edited by Dr. Bernhardt, these three are issued by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
send us a volume called " Aus Deutschen Meisterwer- 
ken," being stories from the mediaeval epics, retold in 
simple modern German by Mr. Sigmon M. Stern. From 
the Macmillan Co. comes a tasteful edition of " Hermann 
und Dorothea," edited by Professor James Taft Hat- 
field, and embodying a corrected text. Lastly, the 
same publishers send us a " Pitt Press " edition of 
" Iphigenie auf Tauris," prepared by Dr. Karl Breul. 

Among the many books recently issued upon the West 
Indian islands, the " History " of Mr. Amos Kidder 
Fiske (Putnam) deserves notice for the excellence of its 
maps and its index. These render the work valuable 
for handy reference. The material of the book itself is 
interesting, though the subjects included in the forty 
chapters are so numerous as to prevent scholarly treat- 
ment of any one of them.

edition, revised and enlarged. 

" The Life of Friedrich Schiller " has just been added 
to the " Centenary " edition of Carlyle, published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" First Lessons in Civics " is a text-book of the most 
elementary sort, the work of Dr. S. E. Forman, pub- 
lished by the American Book Co. 

A translation of Maupassant's " Pierre et Jean," the 
work of Mr. Hugh Craig, has been published by Bren- 
tano's in a handsome illustrated edition. 

A third edition, almost entirely rewritten, of Dr. 
Arthur Newsholme's " Elements of Vital Statistics " 
has just been published by the Macmillan Co. 

A second edition of " The Messages of the Earlier 
Prophets," by Messrs. Frank Knight Sanders and 
Charles Foster Kent, has just been published by the 
Messrs. Scribner. 

"The Talisman," "The Betrothed," and "Wood- 
stock " (the latter in two volumes), are the latest addi- 
tions to the " Temple " Scott, which the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner publish in the United States. 

At last we have an authorized American edition, 
published by the Doubleday & McClure Co., of Mr. Kip- 
ling's " Departmental Ditties and Ballads and Barrack- 
Room Ballads," all in a single volume, with the swastika 
for a trade-mark. 

A two- volume translation of Epictetus, made by Mrs. 
Elizabeth Carter, has been recently issued in the " Tem- 
ple Classics " series (Macmillan). Three new volumes 
have been added also to the ten- volume edition of North's 
Plutarch, in the same series. 

The United States Bureau of Education issues a val- 
uable monograph by Mr. Arthur MacDonald upon the 
" Experimental Study of Children." It is really an 
advance section of the forthcoming report for 1897-98 
of the Commissioner of Education. 

The recently reawakened interest in Robespierre has 
led to a new edition of the biography of that worthy by 
George Henry Lewes. Published fifty years ago, it is 
still a most readable book, and this edition, imported 
by the Messrs. Scribner, should find many readers. 

The " Handbook of British, Continental, and Cana- 
dian Universities, with Special Mention of the Courses 
Open to Women," compiled by Dr. Isabel Maddison 
for the graduate club of Bryn Mawr College, has just 
been published in its second edition by the Macmillan Co. 

" The Dreyfus Story," by Mr. Richard W. Hale, is 
a small book published by Messrs. Small, Maynard & 
Co. It takes for its motto Hamlet's " Report me and 
my cause aright to the unsatisfied," and seeks to tell its 
tangled tale clearly and succinctly. The book should 
find many readers. 

"The Cable Story Book" (Scribner) is a volume of 
selections from the work of Mr. G. W. Cable, prepared 
by Miss Mary E. Burt and Miss Lucy Leffingwell Cable, 
and designed for use in schools. It has an introduction, 



a biographical sketch, several illustrations, and five 
stories the latter slightly simplified, with the author's 
approval, for their present special purpose. It is a good 
book of a good sort, and deserves to be widely used. 

It is reported that Mr. Maurice Hewlett has under- 
taken to prepare for the Macmillan Co. a volume on 
Florence, to serve as a companion to Mr. Crawford's 
" Ave Roma Immortalis." This is as welcome an an- 
nouncement as there could well be, for Mr. Hewlett 
knows both the body and the soul of Florence as do 
few if any other men. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish Racine's " An- 
dromaque," edited by Dr. B. W. Wells, and a thin book 
of " Geschichten und Marchen fur Anfanger," edited by 
Miss Lillian Foster. Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish La- 
biche's " La Grammaire," edited by Dr. Herman S. 
Piatt. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish Lessing's 
" Minna von Barnhelm," edited, with a rather extensive 
apparatus, by Dr. Starr Willard Cutting. 

Volumes IX. and X. of " The Land of Sunshine," 
forming the numbers for the year just ended, and 
bound within a single set of covers, has just been sent 
us by the publishers. We have often had occasion to 
speak a good word for this brave little magazine, and 
to wish it success. The contents include much matter 
of permanent value, besides those sections in which the 
editor keeps up a running fire of comment upon the 
literary and political happenings of the day. In the 
matter of our Spanish and Philippine wars, particularly, 
Mr. Lummis has spoken many sober and fearless words, 
for which patriotic Americans cannot thank him too 
warmly.

Prisoners and Captives 

Has reached its ninth thousand since it was 
first published in this country six weeks ago. It 
is in all respects worthy of the author's master- 
piece, " The Sowers," and was issued by Mr. 
Merriman's English publishers at twenty-one 
shillings. Our price, $1.25. 



The Measure of a Man 

Can be recommended to all women and about 
fifty per cent of mankind. The hero is strongly 
but consistently drawn, and his veneration and 
worship of his lady love and the sacrifices he 
makes in her behalf are sure to recommend 
him to the friendly consideration of the gentler 
sex. E. Livingston Prescott is the author. 
12mo, cloth, $1.25. 



Martyrs of Empire 

Is a novel dealing in an intelligent, interesting, 
and convincing manner with the " open air " 
life of the ranchmen of Australia. To the 
reader whose experience has been partly in 
out-of-the-way places " Martyrs of Empire " 
will make a particularly strong appeal. It is 
a stirring story and at the same time good lit- 
erature. By Herbert C. Mcllwaine. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.25. 

The Angel of the Covenant 

By J. Maclaren Cobham, is a work of rare 
distinction. It is a great historical picture, in 
which fact and fancy are welded together in a 
fine realization of the spirit of the time of 
which it treats, the 17th Century. 12 mo, 
cloth, $1.50.

A Great Historical Novel by Charles Lever. 

Gerald Fitzgerald, the Chevalier. 

By CHARLES LEVER, author of " Harry Lorrequer," etc. With an etched frontispiece by A. D. McCORMlCK. 

Crown 8vo, cloth, uncut, gilt top, $1.50. 

This is no miniature, fragmentary, or imperfect work which the author desired to suppress, but a carefully finished and 
finely conceived historical novel, quite up to its author's very best work. The reason it was not included in Lever's collected 
works was a personal matter between the proprietors of the Dublin University Magazine and the author, and is given at some 
length in the preface. It is a wonderful and graphic picture of the French Revolution, with portraits very carefully drawn 
of some of the sanguinary characters of the time. The principal figure looming up with tremendous significance all through 
the book is that of Mirabean. 



An Exiled Scot. 



From Culloden to the Settlement of the Dutch East India Company. 

By H. A. BRYDEN, author of "Gan and Camera in Southern Africa." With a frontispiece by J. 8.

" Mr. Bryden. already favourably known by his South African stories and sporting sketches, has turned his local knowl- 
edge and historical researches to excellent, account in 'An Exiled Soot.' . . . The pictures of life at the Cape during the 
early Dutch occupation, and in the Isle of France, and of encounters with pirates, lions, and savages, are executed with much 
spint and skill." Spectator \ 

A NEW STORY BY THE AUTHOR OP "BY RIGHT OP SWORD." 

A Dash for a Throne. 

By ARTHUR W. MARCHMONT. Illustrated by D. MURRAY SMITH. Printed on featherweight paper 
richly decorated cover. Large I2mo, $1.25. 

A new novel by the author of that popular story, " By Right of Sword," will be welcomed by all lovers of good fiction. 
The scene is laid in Bavaria, mostly in the neighborhood of Munich, and the plot centres around the throne of the late King 
laidwig, known as the " Mad King," whose eccentricities were the talk of Europe a few years ago. The characters, one 
of whom is the present Emperor of Germany, are excellently drawn, and the interest of the reader is sustained from start 
to finish. 

The publishers are pleased to note that the advance ordert have exhausted the first large edition.

HAVE JUST PUBLISHED: 

DOWSON AND MOORE'S ADRIAN ROME. 

A Contemporary Portrait. 1*2 mo. 

In Adrian Home, a London poet who allows circumstances to turn him from his ideals and make him a man of fashion, 
the authors have produced a notable character study that will appeal to thoughtful people. There are two love themes 
in the novel and the conversations are often epigrammatic. The glimpses of university life at Oxford are truly lifelike, 
and even the minor characters are drawn with indelible skill. 

KRAUSSE'S RUSSIA IN ASIA. 

A Record and a Study, 1558-1899. With Appendix, Index, and 12 Maps. 8vo. 

A book on a question of great present interest. The author is an authority to whom some of the leading English 
periodicals habitually intrust the treatment of the exigencies that arise from Great Britain's competition with Russia in 
Asia. His knowledge of the history and statistics of his subject is probably unsurpassed. 

ROOK'S THE HOOLIGAN NIGHTS. 

Being the life and opinions of a young and unrepentant criminal recounted by himself, as set forth by 

Clarence Rook. 12mo, $1.25. 

The actual experiences of "The Hooligan," a London thief, are here set down by his quondam acquaintance, Mr. 
Clarence Rook, a journalist. Alf . Hooligan is a Cockney with a humor and vernacular worthy of Chevalier. His remin- 
iscences include interesting criminological information, told with the charm of fiction. This book does for the criminal 
quarters of London somewhat what Hugo's " Notre Dame de Paris " did for those of Paris.

Engineer Ford's ideas about our duties to the Filipinos, and the possi-

from a man whose judgment is entirely uninfluenced by political con-

" Winsome and captivating, Content pleases us of

From The Independent, New York : 

"The attractive feature* of this new Bible Dictionary are that it ia in one not over large octavo volume, that it U up-to- 
date, and that it represent* the conservative orthodox scholarship. It does this, however, in a broad and comprehensive way. 
. . . Everything is omitted which was not considered distinctly useful to the Biblical student, and speculative matter is not 
introduced. The illustrative matter is full and used in a systematic way. . . . The maps are recent, accurate, and most of 
them drawn specially for the work. . . . Such a dictionary cannot fail of being extremely useful. In fact it stands alone at 
the present time as the only available compendium of up-to-date Biblical information in the English language."

VICTOR CHERBULIEZ. 

There are readers not a few to whom the 
death of Victor Cherbuliez will prove a loss 
altogether out of proportion to his importance 
as a figure in French literature. " I could have 
better spared a better man " will be the feeling, 
if not the utterance, of the many thousands to 
whom the long series of his novels have been an 
unfailing source of entertainment and delight. 
The appearance of a new book by this talented 
writer never brought with it the thrill of a 
prospective sensation, and never led, as far as 
we are aware, to any excited public discussion, 
ranging its friends and its enemies in two op- 
posing camps. But the promise of each new 
novel (after the first few had given evidence 
of the writer's quality) aroused in the novelist's 
ever-widening audience a sense of quiet antici- 
patory satisfaction that was, perhaps, as fine a 
tribute to his merit as the loud outcries which 
heralded the books of the more conspicuous 
among his contemporaries. 

No less than twenty-two novels have come 
from the pen of this industrious writer during 
the past thirty-five years. Most of them made 
their first appearance in " La Revue des Deux 
Mondes," for which periodical Cherbuliez be- 
came as much of a stand-by as George Sand 
had been during the preceding quarter-century 
or more. The list of the novels is as follows : 
" Le Comte Kostia," " Prosper Randoce," 
" Paule Mere," " Le Roman d'une Honnete 
Femme," " Le Grand-Oeuvre," " L'Aventure 
de Ladislas Bolski," " La Revanche de Joseph 
Noirel," " Meta Holdenis," "Miss Rovel," 
" Le Fiance de Mile. Saint-Maur," " Samuel 
Brohl et Cie.," " L'Idee de Jean Teterol," 
" Amours Fragiles," " Noirs et Rouges," " La 
Ferine du Choquard," " Olivier Maugant," 
"La Bete," "La Vocation du Comte Ghis- 
lain," " Une Gageure," " Le Secret du Pre- 
ceptetir," " Apres Fortune Faite," and " Jac- 
quine Vanesse." A number of these novels 
have been translated into English, but the ma- 
jority, we should say, have not thus been made 
accessible to those who do not read the original. 
And, in our opinion, an enterprising publisher 
in England or the United States would find his

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



account in a complete uniform edition of this 
series of books. 

In attempting to characterize the work of 
Cherbuliez, it will be best to begin with a few 
negative statements. We have already said 
that his novels are not sensational ; this state- 
ment may be amplified by noting that they offer 
no devotion to the goddess of lubricity, that 
they are neither erotic nor neurotic, and that 
they are concerned with problems only as the 
novelist finds problems useful for the illus- 
tration of character. Their delineative power 
is, moreover, not remarkable ; it betrays the 
hand of the master-craftsman rather than that 
of the creative artist, and the entire gallery 
of figures includes few that remain living in 
the memory. When we compare the most 
studied of the types offered us by Cherbuliez 
with even the minor types of the " Comedie 
Humaine," this distinction becomes so obvious 
that it needs no argument. It may also be said 
that the novels of Cherbuliez have little or no 
atmosphere ; they have instead a great deal 
of careful local coloring, and over them all is 
shed the dry light of the philosophical intelli- 
gence. 

Essaying now a more positive sort of criti- 
cism, we must emphasize once more the unfail- 
ing interest of these books. The characters 
are galvanized into just enough of vitality to 
produce a fairly complete illusion when they 
are before us. They are, furthermore, arranged 
in extremely interesting relations with one an- 
other, and the ingenuity of the author in devis- 
ing new situations is really extraordinary. An 
additional element of freshness is provided by 
the great variety of scenes to which we are 
introduced, and by the extent to which char- 
acters of other nationalities than the author's 
own are made to figure. The descriptive powers 
of the novelist are admirable, and we " skip " 
in reading him at the peril of missing some- 
thing delightful or important. In fact, his 
readers soon learn that they cannot afford to 
" skip " him, for his books have almost no pad- 
ding, and are finished in the minutest details. 
Economy of material, united with crispness in 
expression and deftness in the lesser touches of 
his brush, form a combination of qualities that 
go far toward explaining his charm. That he 
is both a man of the world and a scholar trained 
in the processes of exact thought are two fur- 
ther facts that are frequently borne in upon the 
reader's mind ; the former by the ease of the 
author's manner when dealing with many 
diverse conditions of society, the latter by the 



minute and accurate knowledge of a great range 
of subjects, displayed by him without ostenta- 
tion as the particular occasion demands, and iu 
the aggregate too extensive and solid to be 
accounted for by any theory of cramming or 
" reading up " for the special purpose at hand. 
When we add to all that has been said the fact 
that a gentle irony pervades his work, temper- 
ing its good sense and general sanity just enough 
to keep it from being dull and prosaic, we have, 
in a measure, at least, accounted for the feel- 
ing with which, having read every one of the 
twenty-two novels, and expecting to read all 
of them again in default of fresh ones, we 
heard the other day of the death of Victor 
Cherbuliez. 

There is little to be learned from a chrono- 
logical study of this man's books. He was one 
of those writers who early make their mark, 
and never alter it very much after it is once 
made. His first books and his last display about 
the same characteristics, and his qualities, 
together with their attendant defects, appear 
about as distinctly in the " Comte Kostia " of 
1863 as in the "Jacquine Vanesse" of 1898. 
His best books are scattered among the others, 
and bear dates widely separated. We might 
name among them Le Roman d'une Honnete 
Femme," " Me*ta Holdenis," and " Le Secret 
du Pre'cepteur," but it seems invidious to sin- 
gle out even two or three, because the others 
are nearly as good. Still, those just named 
may be recommended to readers desirous of 
making the acquaintance of Cherbuliez ; the 
taste once acquired may be trusted not to con- 
tent itself with so little. 

It should be remembered, also, that Cher- 
buliez did a great deal of writing that was not 
in the form of fiction. Indeed, his debut as a 
man of letters marked him out for a critic of 
art and a student of antiquity rather than for 
a novelist. This book was entitled " Un Cheval 
de Phidias," further described as a series of 
" Causeries Atheniennes." A later volume of 
what was essentially art criticism was called 
" L'Art et la Nature." Cherbuliez was also a 
publicist and critic of contemporary society and 
politics, in this capacity writing regularly for 
La Revue des Deux Mondes," under the 
pseudonym of " G. Valbert," for a long term of 
years. His miscellaneous papers upon these 
subjects were collected into a series of volumes 
bearing such titles as " Profils Etrangers," 
" L'Espagne Politique," " L'Allemagne Poli- 
tique," "llommes et Choses d'Allemagne," and 
" llommes et Choses du Temps Present."

Finally, we mention the fact that two of his 
novels, " Samuel Brohl" and "Ladislas Bolski," 
were dramatized by him, and won a certain 
success upon the boards. 

Charles Victor Cherbuliez (to give him for 
once his unfamiliar full name) was born in 
Geneva, July 19, 1829. His death on the first 
of the present month thus found him within a 
few days of the completion of his seventieth 
year. He was descended from a Protestant 
family that had found refuge in Switzerland 
after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 
and in 1880 reclaimed his French citizenship 
under the provisions of the law provided for 
that purpose. His education was cosmopolitan, 
begun in Geneva, and continued in Paris, Bonn, 
and Berlin. In 1881 he became one of the 
Forty, and in 1892, an officer of the Legion of 
Honor. Long after his resumption of French 
citizenship he continued to live in Geneva, 
where he occupied a chair in the University. 
These are the chief facts of his externally un- 
eventful career ; his real life is revealed to us 
in the many volumes of his published writings. 



GEORGE W. JULIAN. 



George W. Julian, a public man and writer of 
distinction, died on the seventh hist, at his home near 
Indianapolis, Indiana, the State where he was born, 
in 1817. Mr. Julian was a lawyer by profession, 
but early in life entered politics, and became one of 
the most influential public men in the Middle West. 
He was one of the earliest and most determined of 
the abolitionists, and one of the founders of the 
Free Soil party, whose candidate for Vice President 
he was in the campaign of 1852. One of the or- 
ganizers of the Republican party, he was allied with 
Lincoln and Trumbull and the great men who led 
that party to victory in 1860; and in Congress as a 
member of the Committee on the Conduct of the 
War, he had an important part in the events of that 
heroic time. Leaving the Republican party in 1872, 
to support Greeley for the Presidency, he did not 
again take a prominent part in politics, although he 
held the office of Surveyor-General of New Mexico 
under President Cleveland. Since that time he has 
devoted himself chiefly to books and writing. He 
published a volume of Political Recollections some 
ten years ago, and was a frequent contributor to 
periodicals. Many of THE DIAL'S reviews of books 
in American history of the last half-century were by 
him, and his last literary work, a review of Mr. 
Gorham's Life of Secretary Stanton, appears in the 
present issue. In temperament and moral fibre, 
Mr. Julian represented the old school of public men 
now so nearly passed from American life. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

A REVIEWER OUT OF PERSPECTIVE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In reading the review entitled " Aubrey Beardsley in 
Perspective," in THE DIAL of June 16, one is forcibly 
reminded of the saying that the domain of art is " a very 
paradise for the philosopher," so easy is it to make a 
show of wisdom, and by the use of high-sounding phrase 
and the exercise of skill in gliding over difficulties to 
lend to fallacious reasoning an air of plausibility. 
Nevertheless, he who has the temerity to pass upon the 
merit of a work of art ought to be very certain that his 
premises are sound and based upon a clearly-visioned 
" fundamental metapbysic," and that his logic is irref- 
ragable. How often, one is tempted to ask, must the 
fundamental principle be iterated, before it becomes 
plain to every understanding, that, aesthetically consid- 
ered, it is not so much what is done as how it is done 
that makes the difference in works of art. Granted 
equal merit in treatment and handling, that work will 
be the nobler which has the more exalted subject: but 
the subject, although there may be art in choosing it, is 
not in itself art; nor can the value of any man's work as 
art be estimated properly by discussing its ethical ten- 
dencies. Still less can we hope to arrive at a sound 
conclusion by the not uncommon practice of reading into 
the work meanings of which the artist never dreamt. 
It is true that art, in so far as it is a medium of expres- 
sion, may be pressed into the service of any cause, eth- 
ical or other. Yet is it equally true that art, as such, is 
not ethical, neither moral nor non-moral, but aesthetic. 

Whatever relative rank as an artist we may assign to 
Aubrey Beardsley, it must be admitted that he was an 
artist in the full sense of the word, and that, too, an 
artist who at the early age of twenty-two had already 
marked out a path and made a name for himself, who 
had so impressed his personality upon others that he had 
become the leader of a school and had a numerous band 
of followers, most of whom, be it said, only succeeded 
in copying the weaknesses rather than the strong points 
of the master. That many of his drawings are fantas- 
tically grotesque, and some of them even repulsive, no 
candid critic can deny. That this grotesquery was de- 
liberately meant by Beardsley to be an expression of 
" evil " is in my opinion a reading into his work of some- 
thing foreign to his intention. To me it appears rather 
as the expression of amused delight in shocking the 
supersensitiveness of prudes and in confounding the 
ignorance of those who confuse sentiment with art, whilst 
entertaining those who, with him, could see the drollery 
of it all, and feel the charm of the refinement of line, 
the carefully studied composition, and the beauty of de- 
tail, that are after all the chief qualities in his work. As 
Mr. Arthur Symons puts it: "The secret of Beardsley 
is there; in the line itself rather than in anything, intel- 
lectually realised, which the line is intended to express." 

Every young artist in the formative stages of his 
career is influenced to a greater or less extent by the 
works of other artists whom he admires. Even though 
we were not told by those who were close to him, it is 
apparent in his drawings that Beardsley was profoundly 
impressed by the subtle harmony, the exquisite bal- 
ancing of the masses and flow of line, in the compositions 
of Botticelli ; that he also found the same qualities in quite 
a different, yet related, manifestation in Japanese color- 
prints by the masters of the last century; that having 
studied the principles upon which these works were

baaed, he tried to carry them into his own productions. 
His delight and the aim which is plainly shown in every- 
thing he did, from the least to the greatest, is in beauty 
beauty of composition, of line, of mass, of light and 
dark as related to each other, of all the elements that 
combine to make up what for want of a better term we 
call decorative effect. Being a man of strong imagina- 
tion, be let his pencil play over the paper, and, being 
quick to seiie upon any accidental form thus produced, 
he gradually developed a style having originality as well 
as individuality. As might be expected, only a small 
part of the public appreciated the flner qualities in his 
work, although they appealed readily enough to his 
brother artists. For the public generally be became 
merely the producer of amusing pictorial extravaganzas; 
and for the public, so far as its views about art are con- 
cerned, he became imbued with a lofty contempt. As 
Mr. Symons tells us, many of his drawings were merely 
" outrageous practical jokes," done simply from the de- 
sire " to kick the public into admiration, and then to 
kick it for admiring the wrong thing or not knowing 
why it was admiring." Yet in this way he gained the 
public eye, so to speak, and not only made himself famous 
but secured a ready market for his wares. Naturally 
his publishers influenced him in this course by giving 
commissions for the most ultra designs that he could 
produce. Thus, we may be assured, was he led on. 

While Beardsley's work has thus a two-fold phase, 
the only side upon which it can be seriously considered 
is the decorative. The grotesque features are interest- 
ing because of the cleverness of the drawing and the 
unexpected touches that made each new production a 
thing unlike its predecessors. And there is always the 
subtle quality which we call style: the stamp of a strong 
individuality. This often redeems what would other- 
wise be hopelessly vulgar. Then, too, his work is dar- 
ing, aggressive; it forces itself upon one's attention, and, 
whatever else it may be or may not be, it is never weak. 

From the point of view of decorative effect, Beards- 
ley's drawings have very considerable importance. Curi- 
ously enough, this is not so much because his achieve- 
ment was great, for he never really advanced beyond the 
stage of interesting performance and brilliant promise. 
But he had decorative feeling of a high order; and when 
the force of bis idiosyncrasies shall have been spent, it 
will, I am sure, be apparent that he rendered a great 
service to the cause of art in opening the eyes of the 
western world to the aesthetic value of dark and light 
masses as elements in pictorial composition. Had he 
lived, it is more than likely that he would have contin- 
ued to point the way to a better knowledge of others of 
the fundamental principles that have been lost sight of, 
or so covered up as to be scarcely discernible, iu the mad 
rush after ultra realism which until quite recently has 
dominated the art movement of the present generation. 

In spite of its immaturity, I confidently predict that 
it is the early work of Beardsley which will earn for 
him the most enduring fame. What may be called his 
second manner is less vigorous, more labored, less spon- 
taneous. Failing health undoubtedly accounts for some- 
thing. Be that as it may, the second manner would 
probably have given way shortly to a third, and very 
likely a saner manner than either. If, on the other hand, 
he would have continued to produce only the trivial 
and bizarre, deliberately turning aside from subjects 
affording scope for the higher beauty which his friends 
assert that be bad the power to create, then the world is 
little poorer because his career came to an early end.

MR. MCCARTHY'S RECOLLECTIONS.* 

An English reviewer of Mr. Justin McCar- 
thy's " Reminiscences," who evidently felt bound 
by his office to say something or other in dis- 
praise of his author, scores him for being so per- 
tinaciously and unconscionably good-humored. 
He admits that the book is fresh and entertain- 
ing really a much better book than a man of 
Mr. McCarthy's unfortunate political views and 
party affiliations might be expected to write ; 
and he, the reviewer, therefore regrets the more 
that Mr. McCarthy should prove so disappoint- 
ingly unable to rise above his uniform dead 
level of amiability and sweet reasonableness, 
and say something unpleasant about somebody. 
We have not, of course, quoted this fastidious 
critic verbatim ; but the above is about the 
substance of his finding. There is no disputing 
about tastes ; and we own that our English 
friend's verdict struck us as being tantamount 
to asserting that Mr. McCarthy's book is im- 
paired by one of its conspicuous merits. In 
fact, when taking a preliminary and pleasantly 
anticipatory glance through Mr. McCarthy's 
pages we had been charmed to note how fairly 
and considerately, with what unfailing urban- 
ity, this active politician and journalist (prac- 
tical politician and daily journalist, mark you) 
speaks even of people who must, in the usual 
course of things, have spoken quite otherwise of 
himself and his party. Not that Mr. McCarthy 
is all honey, or, better, all " blarney," throughout 
his eight hundred pages of retrospect. There 
are passages here and there that may possibly 
have escaped the eye of his Saxon censor : for 
example, his anything but flattering account of 
Charles Kingsley. This reverend champion of 
the unestablished order of things is roundly 
characterized as " about the most perverse and 
wrong-headed supporter of every political 
abuse, the most dogmatic champion of every 
wrong cause in domestic and foreign politics 
that his time had produced "; and his appear- 
ance upon the platform is thus described : 

" Rather tall, very angular, surprisingly awkward, 
with staggering legs, a hatchet face adorned with 
scraggy gray whiskers, a faculty for falling into the 
most ungainly attitudes, and making the most hideous 
contortions of visage and frame; with a rough provincial 
accent, and an uncouth way of speaking which would be 
set down for caricature on the boards of a theatre. . . . 
Since Brougham's time nothing so ungainly and eccen- 
tric had been displayed upon an English platform."

Mr. McCarthy's " Reminiscences " are not 
autobiographical. They are simply the author's 
recorded impressions and recollections of dis- 
tinguished people he has known during his 
career, and they certainly go to show that from 
his youth up Mr. McCarthy has practised with 
skill the gentle art of making desirable ac- 
quaintances. From such prescriptive celebri- 
ties as Robert Owen and Lord Brougham down 
(chronologically, we mean) to Mr. Kipling, 
few of the larger literary, political, and social 
fish of Victorian times seem to have escaped 
the sweep of his net. The first great personage 
who figures in his pages is the Duke of Well- 
ington. Mr. McCarthy did not exactly know 
the Duke, but he once heard him make a speech 
in the House of Lords. The speech was neither 
long nor eloquent; but it was Wellingtonian, 
and Mr. McCarthy was greatly impressed by it. 
A rash peer, it seems, had in the course of debate 
mildly ventured to say that he feared the "illus- 
trious Duke " had not quite understood the 
measure before the House. The Duke rose, 
morally and physically, like Mrs. Gamp : 

" ' My lords,' he said, striking the table with an indig- 
nant gesture, ' the noble and learned lord has said that 
I do n't understand this Bill. Well, my lords, all I can 
say is that I read the Bill once, that I read it twice, that 
I read it three times, and if after that I don't under- 
stand the Bill, why then, my lords, all I have to say is 
that I must be a damned stupid fellow.' " 

Apropos of Thackeray's alleged weakness 
for aristocratic rank, Mr. McCarthy tells a 
good story of a rather dense and notoriously 
tuft-hunting young acquaintance of his own, 
who also knew the great novelist, and had evi- 
dently bored him, as he had everyone else, with 
the list of his titled friends and connections. 
Says Mr. McCarthy : 

" One day I met him at the Garrick Club, and he 
suddenly began to talk to me about Thackeray. Now, 
look here,' he said, you always refuse to believe that 
Thackeray worships the aristocracy. I '11 give you a 
convincing proof that he does, a proof that I got only 
this very day. Do you see this cigar ? ' He held one 
out between his fingers, and I admitted that I did see it. 
' Well,' he said, c that cigar was given me by Thackeray; 
and do you know what he said when he was giving it to 
me ? ' I had to own that I could not form any guess 
as to what Thackeray might have said. So he went on 
with an air of triumph. Well,' he said, Thackeray's 
words to me were these: "Now, my dear fellow, here 
is a cigar which I know you will be delighted to have, 
because it is one of a box that was given to me by a 
marquis." Now what have you to say ? ' " 

Mr. McCarthy admits that he had nothing to 
say, not even in praise of his young friend's 
nice sense of satire. 

Mr. McCarthy devotes a few pages to Car- 



lyle, of whom he tells a characteristic story, in 
connection with the poet Allingham. Ailing- 
ham, the gentlest of men, disliked nothing more 
than a dispute. " A duel in the form of a de- 
bate " was positively painful to him ; and while 
he had convictions, and the courage of them as 
well, the gentleness of his nature rendered him 
shy of asserting them. One evening, at Car- 
lyle's, there was a discussion of the policy of a 
statesman then in office, and the sage denounced 
this politician and all his works at great length 
and with unusual energy. When his fury had 
spent itself, Allingham, who had been listening 
throughout in silence, mildly suggested that 
after all something might be said on the other 
side. Carlyle broke out with : 

"Eh! William Allingham, ye 're just about the most 
disputatious man I ever met. Eh ! man, when ye 're in 
one of your humors you 'd just dispute about anything." 

Mr. McCarthy knew John Bright well, and 
he once had an argument with him as to the 
propriety of introducing or portraying bad 
characters in imaginative literature. Every 
novel, Mr. Bright held, would be better were 
there no bad people in it. When asked if he 
thought the public would take an interest in 
romances that were written on this plan, he 
contended that the public would be very glad 
in the end to be educated up to such a point of 
artistic morality. Confronted with the exam- 
ples of Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, and Gold- 
smith, Mr. Bright stood by his colors, and 
maintained that "Ivanhoe" would be better 
without Bois-Guilbert, " Nicholas Nickleby " 
without Squeers, "Vanity Fair " without Becky 
Sharp, the "Vicar of Wakefield " without 
Squire Thornhill, and so on. Hard pushed 
with the example of Shakespeare, he nailed his 
colors to the mast, and held that " Othello " 
would be better without lago. Had Mr. Mc- 
Carthy cited Falstaff, we fancy Mr. Bright 
must have struck ; but as it was, he went on 
with the feeble old argument (we have seen it 
applied, mutatis mutandis, much more effec- 
tively to the " bores " of Messrs. Howells and 
James) that: 

" The very fact that there are bad persons in real life 
and that we are sometimes compelled to meet them is 
the strongest reason why we should not be compelled to 
meet them in the pages of fiction, to which we turn for 
relief and refreshment after our dreary experience of 
unwelcome realities." 

At this point Mr. McCarthy did not make 
bold to say, with Dr. Johnson, " Sir, this is 
sorry stuff ; do n't let me hear you say it any 
more," but went on to stagger, as he hoped, 
Mr. Bright with the instance of his favorite 



44 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Milton. Here, says Mr. McCarthy, " I thought 
I had got him at last." For how on earth could 
anybody, even the most scrupulous of " parlia- 
mentary hands," argue seriously that " Para- 
dise Lost " would be a better poem were Satan 
cast out of it ! But Mr. Bright was ready with 
his defense : 

" He argued that the demoralizing effect of introduc- 
ing bad men and women into novels, or into poems, was 
because weak-minded readers might be led into admira- 
tion for them, and might be filled with a desire to imitate 
them ; whereas it was absolutely out of the power of any 
mortal man or woman to imitate Satan or Beelzebub." 

Thinking the thing over calmly, we have our 
doubts as to the exact truth of Mr. Bright'* 
closing statement. 

Mr. McCarthy has a capital chapter on 
" Boston's Literary Men." He met Emerson 
in 1871, and spoke with him of Walt Whitman : 

' Emerson told me that he bad had and still retained 
a strong faith in Whitman as possibly the first poet to 
spring straight from the American soil without foreign 
graft or culture of any kind. But he explained that 
Whitman had an artistic creed of his own, which it was 
difficult for anyone else to accept a creed which de- 
nied the right of artistic ezclnsiveness, and even of 
artistic selection a creed which held that everything 
that was found in nature was entitled to a place in art. 
. . . Emerson spoke with gentle amused deprecation of 
Whitman's theory, bnt frankly owned that it made 
Whitman almost an impossibility for ordinary social 
life." 

Some months later, the author met Whitman 
himself, in Washington. The poet was shab- 
bily lodged in a garret, in a crowded building ; 
and at first glance Mr. McCarthy was rather 
in doubt which of the two current conceptions 
of him to accept the one which figured him 
as really a man absolutely indifferent to public 
opinion, to comforts and conventions, or the one 
which represented him as a poseur who delib- 
erately " went in for " being a penniless poet, 
who got himself up picturesquely for the part, 
and who thrust his poverty on the public as 
vainly and ostentatiously as Jim Fisk flaunted 
his wealth. The mise en scene was perfect. 
There was the truckle-bed, the shaky wash- 
stand, the pair or so of rickety chairs, the shelf 
with the cut loaf of bread, the shabby desk and 
table strewn with the scribbled sheets of ill-paid 
genius. A theatre-goer " would only have to 
see the curtain rise on such a scene to know 
that the poverty-stricken poet was about to be 
* discovered.' " Mr. McCarthy was not long 
kept halting between the two current opinions : 

" I read the story of Walt Whitman's room the mo- 
ment I had looked into the eyes of the good old poet 
himself. If ever sincerity and candor shone from the 
face of a man, these qualities shone from the face of 



Walt Whitman. . . . There was a simple dignity in his 
manner which marked him out as one of nature's gentle- 
men. . . . He found good-natured fault with some of 
the friends who had gone too far, he thought, in sound- 
ing his praises throughout England ; and he altogether 
disclaimed the idea that he considered himself as a man 
with a grand mission to open a new era for the poetry of 
his country. . . . Nothing could be less like the man- 
ner of a man who desires to attitudinize than was the 
whole bearing of Walt Whitman. ... I felt sure that 
I now knew what Walt Whitman was himself, and that 
the charm of real manhood was in him and in all that 
he wrote." . 

It may be remembered that Matthew Arnold, 
when lecturing in this country, usually reso- 
lutely declined to conform to the custom which 
often compels the distinguished foreign lecturer, 
after he has finished his address, to remain in the 
hall and undergo the felicitations and the scru- 
tiny of his audience. Not a few worthy people 
incline to regard this informal social function 
or levee at the close of the lecture as the re- 
deeming feature of an evening of unwonted 
intellectual strain, and as a gratification to 
which the purchase of a ticket of admission 
fairly entitles the bearer. They therefore felt 
themselves slighted, and even deprived of some- 
thing they had paid for, by Mr. Arnold's insu- 
lar habit of eluding them by leaving the hall 
by the back-door or the fire-escape, as soon as 
he had finished what he conceived to be his part 
of the contract. This conduct on Mr. Arnold's 
part was due, Mr. McCarthy assures us, mainly 
to his native unpretentiousness and dislike of 
being lionized, and not at all to supercilious- 
ness or to the unsociable promptings of that 
refrigerator-like temperament ascribed to him 
by the American press. Says Mr. McCarthy : 

"There was nothing ungracious in the mood which 
prompted this resolve; indeed, nobody who knew Mat- 
thew Arnold could easily conceive the idea of anything 
ungracious on his part; only he was not endowed with 
that ' terrible gift of familiarity ' which an envious op- 
ponent ascribed to Mirabeau, and he knew that he never 
could be in his element in trying to exchange compli- 
ments with a crowd of perfectly unknown admirers. 
. . . Travelling in the States, three years after Matthew 
Arnold had returned to Europe, I can say that he had 
not shown himself in any sense an ungenial or unsocia- 
ble visitor; and that I came across many a household 
which he had gladdened by his ready and kindly accept- 
ance of a hospitable invitation, and by his pleasant and 
companionable ways as a guest." 

Mr. McCarthy's book is the fruit of a so- 
journ at a quiet seaside resort, where the mak- 
ing at odd times of uncompulsory ** copy " was 
a recreation. Had Mr. McCarthy written amid 
the stress and fever of London life his pages 
might not have been so thoroughly imbued with 
that kindliness which stung the soul of his

English reviewer. The book reflects the con- 
ditions of its composition. It is easy, rambling, 
informal ; and it has the charm and the defects 
of those qualities. The author has plainly 
given the rein to memory, and the stream of 
reminiscence wanders at will. One name, one 
story, has suggested another ; and the pen has 
followed the pleasantly devious current of the 
thought. The book might have been bettered 
in some ways by careful revision. The reader 
familiar with Mr. McCarthy's " History of Our 
Own Times " will note here and there in the 
" Reminiscences " an old story re-told, an old 
thought re- worded. The style is, as usual, rich, 
picturesque, and allusive rather founded on 
Macaulay, we should say, but not imitative. 
We have long regarded Mr. McCarthy as the 
prince of literary journalists and journalistic 
historians ; and it is pleasant to find that years 
have not staled his attractiveness or dulled his 
animation. These beautifully-made volumes 
stand very near the top of the list of the season's 
reminiscential books. . G. J. 



OUR NATIONAL, POLICY.* 

Dr. Jordan's volume entitled " Imperial De- 
mocracy " contains eight essays and addresses, 
published or delivered, with one exception, since 
the war with Spain began. One notes with 
gratification that President Jordan's literary 
style has gained, in finish as well as in preci- 
sion, since he went to Leland Stanford Univer- 
sity. One notes also, with a deeper satisfaction, 
that throughout these pages one is speaking who 
has abiding convictions as to the " manifest 
destiny " of the American people, and who is 
fearless to utter them in the face of one of the 
fiercest jehads that has ever threatened free 
speech. Not since the days of the assault in 
the United States' Congress on John Quincy 
Adams and Joshua Giddings for their grand 
defence of the sacred right of petition, has 
public opinion in this country been so swayed 
by ignorant and servile intolerance as during 
the past six months. The press of the country, 
with a few honorable exceptions, has worked 
itself into such a state of mind as would be 
gratefully appreciated by a Caesar or a Napo- 
leon, and a state of popular opinion has been 
produced which it requires considerable cour- 
age to question. Men are already debating 
the proposition that instructors in our univer- 
sities are to be required to express no opinions

publicly on questions of public policy unless 
they agree with the powers that be. In the 
face of such an attempt at terrorism as savors 
of Russia rather than of America, it is refresh- 
ing to read such calm and deliberate discussion 
of this vexed subject of American " imperial 
policy " as President Jordan gives us in these 
addresses. Under date of May 25, 1898, he 
says to the graduating class of his university : 

" The war has stirred the fires of patriotism, we say. 
Certainly, but they were already there, else they could 
not be stirred. I doubt if there is more love of country 
with us to-day than there was a year ago. Real love of 
country is not easily moved. Its guarantee is its per- 
manence. Love of adventure, love of fight, these are 
soon kindled. It is these to which the battle spirit 
appeals. Love of adventure we may not despise. It is 
the precious heritage of new races; it is the basis of 
personal courage; but it is not patriotism; it is push. 
. . . Patriotism is the will to serve one's country; to 
make one's country better worth serving. It is a course 
of action rather than a sentiment. It is serious rather 
than stirring. 

" Our heroes were with us already. In times of peace 
they were ready for heroism. The real hero is the man 
who does his duty. It does not matter whether his 
name be on the headlines of the newspapers or not. His 
greatness is not enhanced when a street or a trotting 
horse is named for him. It is the business of the Re- 
public to make a nation of heroes. The making of brave 
soldiers is only a part of the work of making men. The 
glare of battle shows men in false perspective. To one 
who stands in its light we give the glory of a thousand." 

In the address before the Graduate Club of 
Leland Stanford University, delivered Feb- 
ruary 14, 1899, he says : 

" I hear many saying, < If only Dewey had sailed out 
of Manila harbor, all would have been well.' This 
ssems to me the acme of weakness. Dewey did his duty 
at Manila; he has done his duty ever since. Let us do 
ours. If his duty makes it harder for us, so much the 
more we must strive. It is pure cowardice to throw 
the responsibility on him. ... If Dewey captured land 
we do not want to hold, then let go of it. It is for us 
to say, not for him. It is foolish to say that our victory 
last May settled once for all our future as a world power. 
It is not thus that I read our history. Chance decides 
nothing. The Declaration of Independence, the Consti- 
tution, the Emancipation Proclamation, were not mat- 
ters of chance. They belong to the category of states- 
manship. A statesman knows no chance. It is his 
business to foresee the future and to control it. Chance 
is the terror of despotism." 

In a letter to the editor of " The Outlook," 
dated April 26, 1899, after asking some search- 
ing questions of that jingoistic representative of 
the religious press, Dr. Jordan thus concludes : 

" Do what you will with the Philippines, if you can 
do it in peace, but stop this war. 

" It is our fault, and ours alone, that this war began. 
It is our crime that it continues. 

" We make no criticism of the kindly and popular 
President of the United States, save this one: He does 
not realize the wild fury of the forces he has unwillingly

and unwittingly brought into action. These must be 
kept instantly and constantly in hand. The authority 
to do rests with him alone, and if ever ' strenuous life ' 
was needed in the nation, it is in the guiding hand of 
to-day. The ship is on fire. The Captain sleeps. The 
sailors storm in vain at his door. When he shall rise, 
we doff our hats in respectful obeisance. If we have 
brought a false alarm, on our heads rests the penalty." 

The whole attitude of the jingo press since 
February toward the opponents of the adminis- 
tration policy in the Philippines has been one 
of misconception and misrepresentation. A 
large number of thoughtful American citizens 
were of the opinion, after the " Maine " disaster, 
that war with Spain was not necessary to the 
liberation of Cuba from Spanish tyranny. They 
believed that the steady pressure which Presi- 
dent McKinley had for more than a year been 
exerting in Cuban affairs would in good time 
bring its reward in autonomous government for 
that unhappy island. But when Congress, 
driven by popular excitement and newspaper 
frenzy, rushed the administration into war, they 
gave it their loyal and hearty support. In due 
process of time the conquest was completed and 
military governments were set up in Porto Rico 
and Cuba, where in the best spirit of American 
institutions a class of administrators who can- 
not be bought or intimidated have done much 
to make American rule acceptable and popular. 
All that was done in those islands was done in 
close touch and sympathy with their representa- 
tive men. The contention of the so-called anti- 
imperialists is that this has not been done in 
the island of Luzon. They maintain that the 
same masterful and wise policy that was pur- 
sued in the Antilles should have been pursued 
in the Philippines that there should have 
been a policy, instead of the hand-to-mouth 
methods initiated as far back as the Protocol. 
They see no reason to believe that if adroit 
conciliation had been used with Aguinaldo, as 
with Gomez, the superiority of the Saxon, mor- 
ally and intellectually, would have triumphed 
peaceably in the one case as it did in the other. 
Moreover, those among them who have a 
knowledge of international and political as well 
as of constitutional law have never questioned 
the full and sovereign power of the United 
States to perform any sovereign act open to any 
other nation, and consequently to annex any 
territory wherever its power was physically 
adequate, if thought expedient. Their propo- 
sition has been, not that this attempt to force a 
government on the Filipinos is unconstitutional, 
but that it is wrong. As Dr. Jordan well says 
The Constitution is an agreement to secure 



justice and prudence in our internal affairs. 
Its validity is between state and state and be- 
tween man and man." It does not govern our 
international relations. Those are governed by 
a higher than man-made law the law of God 
as evolved in human conscience and human 
recognition of eternal justice. To this law the 
thoughtful opponent of jingoism points the 
American people to-day. He holds, moreover, 
that an administration which has pursued a firm 
and wise course in Cuba has adopted, without 
due reason, a dissimilar one in the Philippines. 
Admiral Dewey, and more than one prominent 
officer of our army, have borne testimony to 
the political intelligence and general fitness for 
good government of the Filipinos ; and yet 
these are the people who have been forced into 
those occasional acts of savagery which may 
always be expected among those who resent 
injustice by a policy the very reverse of that 
conceded to the Cubans. It would seem that 
nearly every presumption that existed a year 
ago in the Malay mind in favor of the sons of 
free and fair and tolerant America has been 
destroyed, and that it has been gone about de- 
liberately to make these inferior races feel that 
the autocracy of the Yankee differs from that 
of the Don only in the superior military ability 
with which it can enforce injustice. If we can- 
not by persuasion and moral superiority induce 
other races to accept the better government 
which we are undoubtedly capable of giving 
them, it were better that they go ungoverned 
all their days. For the thoughtful student of 
American institutions must ever continue to 
maintain that our highest mission among the 
nations of the world is to set a high and mu- 
table example of good and fair government, 
based always upon the intellectual acceptance 
of, and enshrined in the hearts of, the governed.

DR. HALE'S COLLECTED WRITINGS.* 

When the works of a contemporaneous writer 
receive embodiment in a definitive edition, a 
certain stamp of classicality seems to be set 
upon him, so far, at least, as the word " clas- 
sical " can be applied to literature that is cur- 
rent. This distinction has befallen Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale in his ripe old age ; and not 
improperly. With Colonel Higginson, Dr. 
Hale stands as the last of the Old Guard whose

piece*. Boston : Little, Brown, A Co.

services to our native literature have been so 
important for its formative period. Dr. Hale's 
intimate knowledge of the older Boston, Cam- 
bridge, and Concord, his familiar association 
with the elder group of New England literati, 
are in themselves enough to make him an inter- 
esting figure in American letters. But he has 
been not only in it, but of it ; contributing his 
share to a culture-centre whose influence has 
shaped all subsequent development. Some 
sense of this is got as one dips into his recent 
book of memories of Lowell and his friends, 
which, like Mr. Higginson's " Cheerful Yes- 
terdays," recalls so much of a time already 
touched with the glamour of the historic, and 
hence fascinating to read about. 

But Dr. Hale's own contributions to our lit- 
erature have been voluminous and in some cases 
conspicuous. He has been, as everybody knows, 
a man of great and varied activity, within and 
without literature. He has written with his 
eye on the object, in the foreign phrase, 
and that object the amelioration of humanity. 
Life has, to him, meant more than literature, 
as it has come to mean more to Mr. Howells ; 
and literature has had its chief value as it has 
expressed the highest life. This aim, and this 
manifold display of energy, unite to explain his 
merits and his shortcomings as a writer. The 
fact that he has produced rapidly, and has not 
always judged his own work with the extreme 
rigor of the conscientious stickler for technique, 
is understood when we realize that he has writ- 
ten as a moral teacher rather than as an artist 
primarily. It is with a consciousness of the 
practical pressure and purpose behind his labor 
that he uses these words in the very charming 
preface to the opening volume of this beautiful 
ten- volume edition ; words intended to apply to 
another, but also, as he implies, well fitting his 
own case : 

" If it were his duty to write verses, he wrote verses; 
to fight slavers, he fought slavers; to write sermons, he 
wrote sermons ; and he did one of these things with just 
as much alacrity as another." 

We all know that absolute accomplishment in 
one particular genre is not thus attained ; but 
we also know that the life and the life influence 
may be broader and better for that very reason. 
In this tendency to disperse himself generously 
according to the needs of the moment, Dr. Hale 
is like such other of the elder writing men as 
Whittier and Lowell. Indeed, one might go 
further, and say that this is a characteristic of 
American literature, as a whole, especially in 
its earlier manifestations. 



It is in fiction that Dr. Hale made his ten- 
strike : once at least he produced in this kind 
a representative piece of creative literature 
something that must always rank high amongst 
our short story writing. With a sense of this, 
no doubt, the publishers have introduced the 
series with a volume entitled " The Man With- 
out a Country, and Other Stories." The famous 
title- tale, to which the author furnishes some 
valuable prefatory comment, remains a brilliant 
allegory, an inspiration to patriotism in the 
noblest sense, and an example of flawlessly 
wrought imaginative fiction. Dr. Hale could 
afford to rest on his laurels, after doing it. 
Very interesting is his explanation of the curi- 
ous muddle arising from his use of the name 
of Philip Nolan for the hero of the story a 
mistake he tried to rectify afterwards by writ- 
ing " Philip Nolan's Friends," included in one 
of the later volumes of the present edition. 
When the Doctor chose the name, he was quite 
unaware that it was borne by any real person ; 
and not till later did he discover that the his- 
torical Philip Nolan, well remembered in the 
Southwest, was shot by the Spaniards in Texas 
in 1801, so that the story-teller had (appar- 
ently) been taking unwarrantable liberties. 
The whole episode is an amusing illustration of 
the dangers of fictional nomenclature. 

Of the other nine short tales making up this 
initial volume, the best known is " My Double 
and How He Undid Me," an ingenious idea not 
worked off with quite the lightness of touch 
necessary to complete success. It is just the 
motive for a Stockton. The second volume is 
headed by Dr. Hale's most acceptable piece of 
longer fiction, " In His Name," the sterling 
historical sketch which deals with the pathetic 
story of the Waldenses of Lyon in the twelfth 
century ; the balance of the book being taken 
up with holiday stories like " Christmas Waits 
in Boston," " They Saw a Great Light," and 
"Daily Bread." The frank didacticism does not 
seriously interfere with the author's freshness 
of invention and vigor of narrative, though it 
does lend his work, confessedly, an old-fashioned 
flavor. The brief " Hands Off " is a striking 
handling of the text " From what I call evil, He 
educes good." The plan of the edition embraces 
half a dozen works of fiction and social sketches, 
a volume of sermons (which shows a sternly 
selective instinct in so steady a sermonizer as 
Dr. Hale has been, ex officio) ; a volume of 
essays on social subjects ; a volume devoted to 
the autobiographic sketch " A New England 
Boyhood " (possessing an interest similar to

that of the books in the same vein by Mr. 
Warner and Mr. Howells) ; and a volume on 
The History and Antiquities of Boston." As 
an essayist, Dr. Male's qualities are familiar. 
He has a sense of humor which gratefully re- 
lieves the strenuousness of his tone and seri- 
ousness of his purpose. It may be said of his 
writings in general that the reader is perfonv 
bidden into personal relations with the author : 
the manner is heartily confidential. This is 
always a head-mark of your true essayist. The 
new prefaces, written expressly for this edition, 
are one of its main attractions : unlike most 
prefaces, they justify themselves, for Dr. Hale 
is peculiarly happy when talking about these 
children of his brain and heart. He hits just 
the right note of genial reminiscence. It must 
be a comfort to him to feel that his collected 
writings have thus received a permanent and 
handsome embodiment, for on the mechanical 
side these volumes, in aesthetic gray-green with 
gold lettering, and bold agreeable type, are a 
credit to all concerned. The beloved author's 
many admirers, new and old, will welcome the 
opportunity to add to their libraries what we 
trust may not be called, in the horrid idiom, 
for years to come, his " literary remains." 

RICHARD BURTON. 



THE LIFE OF EDWIN M. STANTON.* 

The chief interest and importance of Mr. 
Gorham's two octavo volumes must lie in the 
history of Stanton's work in the War Depart- 
ment. It was there that his great qualities 
intellectual power, masterful will, integrity, 
patriotism, tireless activity, and intense enthus- 
iasm enabled him to perform a service sec- 
ond to none during the most stormy and critical 
period of our national life. The public has 
waited long for this biography. Why so many 
years have passed without any attempt to tell 
the story it is hard to say. Perhaps the chief 
reason may be found in the fact of Stanton's 
absolute independence, and the further fact 
that in the vast ant) many-sided work he had to 
do he had not time for the little courtesies and 
amenities which attract people. He offended 
many by the abruptness and unceremoniousness 
of his manner. " He was the man who said 
4 no ' for the government when it had to be said, 
no matter how distasteful or offensive it might 
be to those to whom it was addressed." The

man who says " no " is bound to be disliked by 
narrow partisans and place-hunters, who com- 
municate their petty prejudices to others. Of 
all public men, 8 tan ton seems to have cared 
the least about what was said of him. He never 
replied to attacks upon himself. But when 
Horace Greeley, after the victories of Fort 
Henry and Fort Donelson, wrote of Stanton as 
the minister who organized " those victories, 
he was quick to disclaim such credit in a letter 
to the " Tribune " in which he said : 

' Who can organize victory ? Who combine the ele- 
ments of success on the battlefield ? We owe our rec-nit 
victories to the spirit of the Lord, that moved our sol- 
diers to rush into battle, and filled the hearts of our 
enemies with terror and dismay. . . . What, under the 
blessing of Providence, I conceive to be the true organ- 
ization of victory and military combination to end this 
war was declared in a few words by General Grant's 
message to General Buckner, I propose to move 
immediately upon your works.' " 

Men might tell all manner of lies to his dis- 
credit : this troubled him only because it grieved 
and dismayed his friends ; but such was his 
sense of honor that undue praise he could not 
bear. In a private letter to the Rev. Heman 
Dyer, a friend of his youth, in May, 1862, 
giving the real facts of the difficulty between 
himself and McClellan, it plainly and beauti- 
fully appears that the motives governing all 
his conduct of public affairs were such as over- 
leap time and look forward to eternity." The 
deep religious strain in Stanton's make-up con- 
stantly appears, and it was his implicit trust in 
the success of righteousness and justice that 
gave him so little patience with halters and 
trimmers. He was one of the rare crucible 
men, in contact with whom individuals were at 
once reduced to their component parts. His 
instinctive insight into men and things was 
what gave him his marvellous grasp of the whole 
situation throughout the war. The man who 
thus sees through other men, and shows that he 
sees through them, may be a very great power ; 
he is not likely to be popular, or " by flatterers 
besieged." Perhaps it is well that his biography 
has been delayed so long. There has been time 
for many passions and prejudices to die out, 
and it is more possible to view the scene and 
its actors in their true light. 

Edwin McMasters Stanton was born at 
Steubenville, Ohio, in 1814. His father, a 
physician with a good practice, died thirteen 
years later, leaving a family of four children 
with very limited means, so that Edwin, the 
oldest, had to leave school and take employ- 
ment in a bookstore, where he remained four

years. He kept up his studies all the while, 
and being ambitious for further educational 
advantages he entered Kenyon College at the 
age of seventeen ; but he was not able for 
financial reasons to finish the course, and left 
during his junior year, to enter upon the study 
of law. In 1836 he was admitted to the bar, 
married, and entered with energy upon what 
seemed his life work in the profession in which 
his whole ambition was centred and in which 
he had a singularly successful and brilliant 
career for twenty-five years, until he took his 
seat in the cabinet of President Buchanan. 
The chapter detailing how the boy Stanton 
" went over to Jackson " is exceedingly read- 
able, and illustrates one or two characteristics 
that manifested themselves very early in his 
life. Dr. Stanton had been a firm adherent of 
Clay and Adams, and if his son had been like 
most sons he would doubtless have inherited 
his father's political and other views. But 
even as a small boy he had been considered 
self-reliant, positive, and somewhat imperious, 
though not combative or abusive. When the 
promulgation of Calhoun's nulification doctrine 
called forth President Jackson's immortal proc- 
lamation of December, 1832, in which he as- 
serted the supreme authority of the national 
government on all subjects intrusted by the 
Constitution to federal control, young Stanton 
at once turned his back upon old political asso- 
ciations and enlisted with all the enthusiasm 
and zeal of his nature in the cause of the Union. 
This was significant, as showing his disposition 
to think for himself and to stand on his own 
feet, and his sympathy with Democracy ; for 
Jackson, whatever his faults, was a real be- 
liever in the people the rank and file of 
humanity. 

Stanton's career as a lawyer is admirably 
given. He steadily rose in his profession, and 
was engaged in many important cases, some of 
them of national fame. As a speaker he was 
earnest and eloquent, having, it is said, two 
different styles, one a vehement style adapted 
for a jury, while before the Supreme Court at 
Washington he was calm, deliberate, and 
impressive, carefully avoiding all exuberance 
of feeling. Perhaps no lawyer ever better pre- 
pared himself in advance. He carefully mas- 
tered both sides of every case, and few men 
have been capable of such prodigious and inces- 
sant mental labor. Activity was his delight, 
and when one piece of work was finished he 
turned to fresh tasks with the appetite and 
inspiration of youth. 



Being much engaged in Supreme Court prac- 
tice, he removed to Washington in 1856, after 
residing successively at Cadiz, Steubenville, 
and Pittsburg. Although his legal business 
occupied him to the exclusion of all political 
interests, such a man could not but have very 
pronounced views on the questions then before 
the public. The supporter of Jackson and Van 
Buren, he had been opposed to nullification, 
secession, a national bank, state bank monop- 
oly, and a high tariff. With the defeat of Van 
Buren, in 1844, his political enthusiasm some- 
what cooled; but in 1848 he was for the Free 
Soil ticket, his sympathies being openly with 
the Northern Democrats in their resistance to 
Southern domination within the party. In 1852 
Stanton's interest in politics was so slight that 
he did not even attend the National convention 
which met in Baltimore, although he was in 
Washington at the time. Although he took no 
part in the canvass of 1856, and had no vote, 
being a resident of Washington, he stood un- 
mistakably on the side of President Buchanan 
in his Kansas policy of 18578, and two years 
later regarded the salvation of the country as 
hanging on the election of Breckenridge. In 
a word, Stanton was a Democrat prior to and 
including 1861, opposed to slavery, but a firm 
upholder of the laws constitutionally enacted 
for its protection. 

" That he believed the success of the Republican 
party would endanger the Union, and that he adhered 
to the extreme wing of the Democratic party after it 
had subordinated all other questions to the protection of 
slavery in the rights guaranteed it by the Constitution, 
as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in 
the Dred Scott case, must be admitted. That when the 
apprehended danger to the Union followed Republican 
success, he rose superior to all party trammels, and in 
the cabinet of Mr. Buchanan acted with high courage 
and the most unselfish patriotism, none can deny." 

On the 20th of December, 1860, Stanton 
was appointed Attorney-General by President 
Buchanan. The review of the political situa- 
tion at that time is graphically given in Chap- 
ter XII., in which it appears that the election 
of Lincoln was expressly desired and planned 
for by the extreme Southern leaders as a pre- 
text for the long-threatened dissolution of 
the Union, for which steps had been taken in 
advance by South Carolina. The disunion 
conspiracy, involving Secretary of the Treasury 
Howell Cobb, Secretary of War Floyd, Assist- 
ant Secretary of State Trescott, Quartermaster- 
General Joseph E. Johnston, and others, is 
well stated ; and one is simply amazed that 
treason should ever have gained such a foot- 
hold in the national councils, or, having gained

it. that it should ever have been circumvented. 
It was well known during the closing months 
of Buchanan's term that a revolution was brew- 
ing ; but what was its extent, and whether it 
would be precipitated immediately after the 
election, thus taxing all the patriotism and 
energies of the outgoing administration, or 
whether the crisis might be delayed until the 
advent of Lincoln to power, were questions 
earnestly considered by Buchanan and his ad- 
visers, as is shown in the next few chapters. 
The attitude of Judge Jeremiah 8. Black, then 
Attorney-General, in November, 1860, as to the 
authority of the Federal Government over a 
State that asserts its independence, and the 
way in which President Buchanan bettered his 
instructions in his message of December 3, are 
well sketched. It is sickening to consider the 
miserable weakness and cowardice and blind- 
ness of Buchanan during those days while 
bloody treason flourished all around him. On 
the 20th of December, South Carolina declared 
the Union dissolved ; and on the same day 
Edwin M. Stanton was appointed Attorney 
General in place of J. S. Black, who had suc- 
ceeded Lewis Cass as Secretary of State and 
refused to accept this latter position when 
Stanton was made Attorney-General. They 
had long been close friends, and Black was cer- 
tainly not calculating without his host in this 
matter, for if anyone could guide him and his 
chief out of the perils that surrounded them, it 
was Stanton. 

Space forbids us to go into the details of 
Stanton's work for the Northern cause, which 
he clearly saw was the cause of his country, 
during the closing months of Buchanan's ad- 
ministration. It is all summed up in the state- 
ment that his loyalty to the Union was a pas- 
sion, dominating his every thought and act. 
" He set on foot inquiries as to the purposes of 
the secessionists in Washington and vicinity, 
and prosecuted them with untiring zeal. He 
made proselytes and denounced heretics. To 
Democrats and Republicans he set the example 
of sinking partisanship in the service of the 
Union." He took the lead, and was most assid- 
uous in creating the pressure under which 
President Buchanan finally gave orders for the 
presence of troops to guard the capital against 
the secessionists. If with Stanton at that time 
patriotism went before humanity, the same 
must be admitted of Abraham Lincoln, who 
was willing to place the nation under perpetual 
bonds to keep the peace toward slavery, and 
even to see it extended into New Mexico rather 



than see the Union perish or even encounter 
the perils of a war for its preservation. Stan- 
ton's presence in Buchanan's cabinet was felt at 
once. Mr. Gorham says he instantly changed 
the tone of its deliberations, and in a 
" Discussion as to the binding force of a shuffling unoffi- 
cial agreement to leave Sumter unprotected thundered 
out the blunt truth to Floyd and Thompson, that they 
were advocating the commission of a crime for which, if 
committed, they ought to be hanged, and were urging 
the President to an act of treason for which, if per- 
formed, he could be impeached, removed from office, 
and punished under the penal code. Floyd, who bad 
up to that very time posed as a unionist, now appeared 
in his true character, and gave up the contest by resign- 
ing. Thompson soon followed, on a false pretense, and 
Thomas, Cobb's successor, followed him. The President 
surrounded himself with a patriotic cabinet, and thus 
escaped the fate false friends had been preparing for 
him." 

Well did Attorney-General Hoar, after Stan- 
ton's death, picture him as standing manfully 
at his post during those ten dark weeks of that 
winter of national agony and shame, giving 
what nerve he could to timid and trembling 
imbecility, and meeting the secret plotters of 
their country's ruin with an undaunted front, 
until before that resolute presence the demons 
of treason and civil discord appeared in their 
own shape as at the touch of Ithuriel's spear, 
and fled baffled and howling away. 

Stanton's distrust and dislike of Lincoln 
during the first months of his administration 
are clearly set forth, and the story of how these 
two men found each other out and gradually 
came to see through the same glasses is one of 
those pleasing features which give to history 
the charm of romance. During all the time 
from March 4, 1861, to January 15, 1862, 
although a member of Lincoln's cabinet, Stan- 
ton never once met the President. He was not 
alone in his harsh and bitter feeling toward 
Lincoln's administration for its early halting 
movements ; and the Union Democrats were no 
more outspoken in their denunciations than 
were many Republicans at that time. The dis- 
graceful scramble for office which turned the 
government into a vast patronage distributor 
when the nation seemed literally " lying su- 
pinely on its back, while its enemies bound it 
hand and foot," aroused the indignation of 
earnest patriots in all parts of the country. 
Men of Stanton's temperament could have no 
patience with the policy which spent the sum- 
mer in explaining to weak Unionists that it 
was quite constitutional to return rebel blows 
and that the Constitution did not forbid the 
exercise by the nation of the law of self-preser-

vation. To such men, these were not open 
questions. 

Perhaps that part of the biography devoted 
to the pitiful failures of McClellan is one of 
the most interesting in the work. Some may 
think too much emphasis is laid on McClellan's 
shortcomings. But an author must be in sym- 
pathy with his subject. This is a Life of 
Stan ton. Stan ton and McClellan were as un- 
like in temperaments, characters, and methods 
as it is possible to imagine. Stanton is cer- 
tainly just the background against which Mc- 
Clellan's weaknesses are most sharply defined, 
and the latter's crookedness seems particularly 
perverse as seen against the absolute straight- 
forwardness of the Secretary of War. 

When, on January 13, 1862, Stanton was 
transferred by Lincoln from the office of Attor- 
ney-General to that of Secretary of the War 
Department, he did not accept the latter place 
till he had called upon McClellan for advice, 
so says McClellan in his " Own Story." 
Both were Union Democrats, whose relations 
were known to be friendly, and Stanton's resist- 
less energy and strong will seemed to promise 
an aggressive course against the enemies of the 
government from that time forth. Northern 
newspapers and men of all parties hailed the 
appointment with joy and fresh hope. He was 
a lawyer, with a knowledge of just what powers 
the Constitution gave to the government ; and 
his contention was that Congress possessed the 
war-making power without limit, and that the 
President was vested by Congress with full 
authority to do all that may be done in civilized 
warfare. It was through his influence that 
Lincoln at length asserted himself as de facto 
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of 
the United States. In the words of Mr. Gor- 
ham, Stanton was gifted with the rarest execu- 
tive faculty, which, while keeping the main 
object in view, masters the knowledge of all 
details, divides the labor between wisely se- 
lected subordinates, and energizes their action 
by his own vigilant supervision and by holding 
them to a strict accountability for their work. 
He seems to have had his eye constantly on 
every part of the field of national affairs in any 
way connected with his department. He knew 
all about the vessels and forts in our command, 
the size of every gun, and how it was mounted ; 
he knew the condition of health of every officer ; 
he had " feelers " in all directions. He was all 
day at his post, and late into the night ; not 
infrequently morning found him still on duty. 
He went to the front, or half across the conti- 



nent, when necessary for investigation or con- 
sultation. He was one of those rare men who 
seem made of iron, and are uttery tireless and 
sleepless in the service of whatever cause they 
have at heart. 

There is not time to rehearse the thrilling 
scenes of the war, nor is it necessary here. 
The story never grows old, and it is set forth 
in this Life with spirit and fairness. Lincoln's 
patience, which to men of Stanton's type ceased 
to be a virtue, when, although he believed Mc- 
Clellan had played false to the army and had 
contributed to Pope's defeat, he still kept him 
in command, is well portrayed. Stanton's fight 
for the country against Johnson, and his death 
just after his appointment by Grant as a Jus- 
tice of the Supreme Court in December, 1869, 
with many kindred matters, are given in detail, 
and constitute one of the most thrilling portions 
of the biography. 

The second volume is largely devoted to the 
question of Reconstruction. Stanton was the 
only member of the cabinet who totally repudi- 
ated Johnson's scheme of reconstruction. He 
stated his opinions with great clearness, and 
never lost sight of the mischievous tactics of 
Seward and Johnson. When the Attorney- 
General gave an opinion which would have 
made the Reconstruction Act a nullity and re- 
stored the rebel element to power, the supple- 
mentary Reconstruction Act was promptly 
passed, at the suggestion of Stanton, which 
made it unequivocally certain that Congress, 
as the war power of the government, must be 
obeyed. Federal officials in the South con- 
tinued their efforts to get rid of the military 
orders of commanding generals by invoking the 
civil power, but they were promptly advised 
that the military authorities were absolutely 
supreme. The President was commander-in- 
chief of the armies, but his champions forgot 
that in this case Congress had relieved him from 
that duty. It was in dealing with this question 
that Stanton overhauled the action of the gov- 
ernment from the beginning respecting the 
authority of the Secretary of War. This he 
did at the request of the Committee on the Con- 
duct of the War. He found that under the 
law the several chiefs of the bureaus in the War 
Department, including the Adjutant- General, 
were subordinates of the Secretary of War, and 
that all orders to them should go through him. 
This rule considerably extended the authority 
of the Secretary of War, and General Grant 
hesitated at first to follow it, as did Generals 
Scott, Schofield, and Sherman. But the care-

f ul statement of the case, as presented by Stan- 
ton, brought them to his way of thinking, and 
the rule which had prevailed for more than a 
hundred years was abrogated. 

From a literary standpoint, the second vol- 
ume is not equal to the first. It lacks smooth- 
ness, and evidently did not receive the pruning 
that was given to Volume I. This is not the 
final Life of Edwin M. Stanton ; but the work is 
conscientiously and sympathetically done, and 
it contains the material from which in time a 
more concise and popular biography will be 
compiled. It is a healthy and inspiring story, 
and one that young men especially should pon- 
der. As the friends who have sat with you 
about the family hearthstone have helped to 
create the atmosphere of your home, and as 
the visits of certain rarely-gifted souls seem to 
leave a sort of blessed influence behind which 
you feel long after they have passed beyond 
your porch, so the knowledge of such lives as 
this, so full of consecration and zeal and high 
endeavor, adds to our sense of the preciousness 
of our government and of the worth of human 
nature. 

The stamp of the Riverside Press denotes 

that from a mechanical point of view the book 

is without a flaw ; and the illustrations and 

facsimiles add much to its interest and value.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

One may take Mr. Lafcadio Hearn's 
" Erotics and Retrospectives " (Lit- 
tle, Brown, & Co.), or at least the last 
half of it, aa a contribution to science, if one likes. 
Some people, when they read these derivations from 
ancestral feeling of oar pleasure at red sunsets, at 
the blue of the sky (aa in other things), will like to 
compare them with those evolutionary speculations 
on the color-sense of which Mr. Grant Allen's books, 
now twenty years old, are interesting examples. 
Bat perhaps that is taking it too seriously not for 
Mr. Hearn, bat for the reader ; one may prefer to 
be reminded of M. Maeterlinck's " in the very tem- 
ple of love we do but obey the unvarying orders of 
an invisible throne." We do not mention these two 
names with any idea that Mr. Hearn's treatment of 
Heredity, if we may so call it, was suggested either 
by Mr. Allen or M. Maeterlinck. We suppose it 
most probable that Mr. Hearn was led to form his 
opinions by the general tendencies of the thought of 
Japan ; and, indeed, we hope that this is the case, 
for, if so, we have rather an interesting coincidence. 
M. Maeterlinck is a descendant of the Christian 
mystics of the middle ages : Mr. Allen is a follower 



of Darwin. Mr. Hearn by the thought of the East 
comes to some of the same conclusions. There is 
probably some mutual influence ; but this is only an 
example of what is otherwise well known namely, 
that the tendencies of Eastern, Mystic, and Evolu- 
tionary philosophies are in more than minor points 
alike. It is not proper, however, to leave the idea 
in mind that in Mr. Hearn's latest book we have 
merely the popular development of a philosophic 
theory. The last half of the book, the Retro- 
spectives," does consist of a series of studies of this 
sort, suggested by various little things which natur- 
ally occur in an Eastern life and have their analo- 
gies in our own. And as Mr. Hearn holds very 
strongly to the opinion that we are largely the re- 
salt of the known causes which in ages past have 
gone to our making, the first part of the book is 
naturally not without color of the same idea. Other- 
wise the " Exotics " are not connected, but are dif- 
ferent Japanese sketches, one of an ascent of Fuji, 
one of singing insects, one on the Literature of 
the Dead, and on other matters, all very distinctive 
and very distinctly of Mr. Hearn's quality, though 
some of them are more categorical than is usual 
with him. Still, all are good, for Mr. Hearn always 
writes with that intimate sentiment of comprehen- 
sion that comes from his real knowledge and appre- 
ciation of Japan, which is probably surer than that 
of any other Englishman or American. For our- 
selves, we rather prefer the " Exotics "; with the 
" Retrospectives " we are constantly oppressed by 
the existence of a pervasive, half-apparent philoso- 
phical theory, which we cannot define and put into 
form, at least not without more material than is here 
offered us. But the other sketches or fantasias, 
as Mr. Hearn calls them are by no means with- 
out their interest, even to those who care nothing 
for their philosophy.

niillan) is a good thing to read as far 
as the story is concerned, but we fear its moral effect 
cannot be of the best. The chief figure is not pre- 
sented to as as a noble-minded ideal of our own 
time, bat as a sort of Homeric hero, more like 
Ulysses than Ajax as suits the march of modern 
intellect. He wishes to defend the Short Line, and 
that end covers all means. He fights the unscrupu- 
lous bribes of his opponents with more bribes ; when 
they buy one judge to issue injunctions, he gets an- 
other ; when they hire rowdies to capture trains and 
stations, he hires other rowdies to recapture them. 
What a lesson for the youth of America ! Success 
comes of meeting political fraud, judicial corruption, 
and open violence, with more fraud, more corrup- 
tion, more violence. Trifling aside, however, this is 
the weak part of the book : Jim Weeks, the paladin 
of the Western railroad world, is no different from 
anybody else ; he is only a little more so than most. 
In other words he is not a person but an abstrac- 
tion. The creation of characters is not so easy as

the telling of stories, so that it is not remarkable 
that the authors of " The Short Line War " have 
been more successful in giving us a rattling account 
of plot and counter-plot than in really conveying to 
us an idea of the railroad champion, his devoted 
young secretary, and the beautiful maiden who 
wanders charming and unsustained, somewhat per- 
plexed though never shocked, through a jarring 
labyrinth of utter unmorality. In spite of all this, 
we are not much afraid of recommending the work 
to our readers as a summer diversion. It is to be 
regarded as one of the realistic extravaganzas which 
the present romanticism has called to light. We 
must not think of it as a transcript of life, but must 
look at it in the spirit in which Charles Lamb viewed 
the Restoration drama. So regarding it, we may 
easily enjoy the verve and cleverness of the authors, 
without being shocked at their lack of high principle 
and moral impulse. 

An pertaining Miss Clara Tschudi's popular sketch 
truthful book on of "Eugdnie, Empress of the French " 
Empress Eugenie. (Macmillan), is characterized by the 
same good qualities that we noted in our comments 
on her life of Marie Antoinette. Mr. E. M. Cope 
is again the translator, and English readers may 
well thank him for making the books of this talented 
Norwegian writer thus accessible. Miss Tschudi is 
one of the easiest and pleasantest of narrators ; and 
we remember what a relief it was to read her clear, 
just, and unpretentious little monograph on Marie 
Antoinette shortly after having waded through (or 
well into) a two-volume Serbonian bog of verbiage 
and labored special-pleading, in which a lachrymose 
and tireless Frenchman tried to make a heroine of 
that bad sovereign and trumpery character. Miss 
Tschudi is not profound or exhaustive, and does not 
pretend to bs. She writes mainly to entertain, and 
she tries honestly to write the truth. Her book is 
sympathetic, yet she is aware of Eugenie's faults ; 
and she does not try to gloss them. We do not, how- 
ever, think she has sufficiently emphasized the fact 
that the Empress was largely to blame for the heart- 
less, spectacular way in which the ill-starred Prince 
Imperial was thrust into danger whenever a scrap 
of political capital or cheap popularity was to be 
gained by it. The farcical " baptism of fire " busi- 
ness at Saarbruck was prompted and approved by 
Eugenie. Think of setting this mere child on the 
firing line to be " potted at " by the Germans, in 
order that a sensational ^efo'2-Napoleonic bulletin 
might be sent to Paris ! Miss Tschudi may be right 
in stating that the Empress opposed the titular 
Prince Imperial's fatal expedition to Africa in 1879 ; 
but such is not our conception of the matter. At 
all events, the adventure was at bottom a contemp- 
tible " grandstand play," in popular phraseology ; 
and the Zulus were least of all to blame for its issue. 
Miss Tschudi's book seems to us the most readable 
and the least misleading of the popular ones on the 
subject. There is a pretty frontispiece portrait in 
colors.

The second volume of Prof. Hast- 



in 8 > 8 great Dictionary of the Bible " 

Bible Dictionary. & & . 

(Scnbner) continues the impression 
made by the first. To it falls a number of matters 
among the most important in Biblical study, and 
the mere enumeration of subjects of some of the 
papers Flood, Galatia, Genealogy, God, Gospels, 
Epistle to the Hebrews, Hell, Hexateuch, Incarna- 
tion, Isaiah, Jesus Christ, the Johannine writings 
will show the influence it is certain to have upon 
future religious teachings. As in the preceding 
volume, the point of view is thoroughly modern, but 
the treatment is reverent perhaps all the more so 
in that no attempt is made to brush away or blink 
difficulties. Sometimes the conservative will feel 
this frankness is perhaps a little over-frank, as in 
the article upon Genealogy ; but the radical will 
find little to his liking, so sober is the work in all 
the important papers. Occasionally, as is natural, 
one feels a trifle disappointed, as in the article upon 
the Gospels ; and at other times it is hard to feel 
the wisdom of taking space for discussions of some 
of the more obsolete words (like " glisten ") of the 
Authorized Version. But there can be nothing but 
admiration for an article like that upon Jesus Christ, 
in which there is maintained an almost impossible 
balance between caution and absolute liberty in 
investigation. It marks a long step forward in the 
evangelical-critical study of this most important sub- 
ject. The difference in spirit between English Old 
and New Testament criticism is well shown by a 
comparison of the papers on the Hexateuch and the 
Gospel of John ; while those upon Jerusalem and 
the Herods are good examples of unbiased archaeo- 
logical and historical studies. Taken altogether, 
there is little but praise for the volume, and for the 
work as a whole. 



Study of 
Economics 
in schools. 



The series of " Economic Studies," 
published as a bi-monthly periodical 
by the American Economic Associa- 
tion (Macmillan), is now in its fifth year, and num- 
bers a score or more of valuable monographs. The 
latest of them is the work of Mr. Frederick R. Clow, 
and has for its subject "Economics as a School 
Study." It will be remembered that the Committee 
of Ten reported adversely to the inclusion of eco- 
nomics in secondary school work, and that Dr. F. H. 
Dixon has made a notable plea for economic his- 
tory as a substitute for economic science in secondary 
education. Mr. Clow, on the other hand, presents 
a brief for economic science ; and his argument is, 
we believe, incontrovertible. Both for knowledge 
and for disciplinary power, economics is of the 
highest value for young persons about to be gradu- 
ated from secondary schools, and Mr. Clow has 
made the most convincing statement in behalf of 
this proposition that we have ever seen. There is 
a world of truth, moreover, in his statement that 
recent " discussions have left the fundamentals of 
the science unchanged," and that the traditional 
arrangement of the subject is still the proper frame-

To turn from law to literature has 
been the recreation and delight of 
many a man at the bar, from the 
time of Bacon and Fletcher of Saltoun to the pres- 
ent, so far as English is concerned. To follow the 
thought of Mr. Clarence S. Darrow through the five 
essays which make op the book named from the 
first of them A Persian Pearl " (The Royoroft 
Shop), is to find the critical faculty of the lawyer at 
its best. To Omar Khayyam, to Walt Whitman, 
and to Robert Barns, Mr. Darrow brings a fine 
sense of analysis coupled with a vivifying sympathy 
which proves his own enjoyment of those three 
writers, different as are their several appeals. From 
them to a strong plea for " Realism in Art " is not 
a long stop, and the brief for realism is argued out 
with good humor and a perfect understanding of the 
necessity for idealism as well. Of another and more 
personal sort is " The Skeleton in the Closet." The 
skeleton is an uncomfortable combination of dese- 
crated ideals and a bad conscience, with an insistent 
plea for the betterment of character almost as 
insistently disregarded by its possessor. The book 
as a whole leaves a pleasant impression of broad 
and catholic interests in life.

Pleasurable emotions not a few await 
the reader of Mr. Michael Mac-

sional joy of meeting an old friend. We do not 
mean to carp at Mr. MacDonagh for introducing 
now and then a good old favorite ; but he really 
might have spared us Sir Boyle Roche's bird 
which seems to have the gift of being in as many 
places in literature at once as has, say, Mr. Andrew 
Lang. Mr. MacDonagh attempts in his book to do 
for Ireland what Dean Ramsay has done in his 
" Reminiscences " for Scotland. He has given us, 
at all events, a capital Hibernian jest-book, which 
shows " Pat " as he really is, with all his delightful 
native wit and simplicity, and not as the caricatur- 
ists of the comic " Weeklies " paint him. The book 
is a faithful mirror of the lighter traits of Irish 
character, and it* popularity is attested by the fact 
that it has now reached a second edition.

The great West is the paradise of 
the health-seeker. Mrs. Edith M. 
Nicholl's " Observations of a Ranch- 
woman in New Mexico " (Macmillan) is what an 
acute observer, on a search for physical strength, 
jotted down as of general interest. She gives us a 
sketch of the Mexican on his native heath, of his 
methods of work, and the results he achieves. The 
politics and sectionalism of the territory are sub- 
mitted to the caustic criticism of her ready pen. 
The enchanting scenery, the equable climate, and 



the special attractions of the country engage her 
attention through many pages. As long as the au- 
thor confines her attention to the peculiarities and 
conditions about her, she can carry along the intel- 
ligent reader; but when she attempts to dilate on 
wages, education, our help, and such themes, weari- 
ness and monotony take the place of interest. The 
earlier half of the book is a contribution of some 
value on affairs in that section of the frontier. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A reproduction of the designs made by William 
Blake to illustrate Thornton's Virgil (1821) is sent us 
by Mr. Thomas B. Moeher, in the form of one of the 
most beautiful volumes that bear his imprint. The mea- 
gre material afforded by these designs alone is pieced 
out by means of an introduction, some notes, Samuel 
Palmer's translation of the first eclogue, and the imita- 
tive eclogue of " Thenot and Colinet," by Ambrose 
Philips, the whole, aided by thick paper with generous 
margins, forming a sizable octavo volume. The work is, 
we need hardly say, a delight to the book-lover's sense. 

Volume IX. of the " Harvard Studies in Classical 
Philology " (Ginn) is in a certain sense a memorial 
volume to Professors Lane and Allen, who left among 
their manuscripts " several papers in different stages of 
completion." Portraits of both men are given, as well 
as memoirs, Professor Morgan writing of Lane ami 
Professor Geenough of Allen. This matter tills about 
one-third of the volume; the remaining contents are by 
several hands, and relate mainly to various aspects of 
the work of Plautus. 

The Bostpn Public Library has just made an import- 
ant contribution to scientific literature in the publication 
of " A Selected Bibliography of the Anthropology and 
Ethnology of Europe, compiled by Dr. William Z. 
Ripley. Dr. Ripley has had much learned collaboration 
in his task, and the result is a volume of 160 pages, 
comprising about 2000 titles. The interesting state- 
ment is made that all of the works mentioned (excepting 
possibly five per cent) are on the shelves of the library 
whence this bibliography issues. In a sense, the present 
work is a companion volume to Dr. Ripley's forthcoming 
treatise on " The Races of Europe." 

"The International Year Book" for 1898, published 
by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., is " a compendium of 
the world's progress in every department of human 
knowledge for the year." It has been edited by Pro- 
fessors Frank Moore Colby and Harry Thurston Peck, 
and is an octavo volume of nearly a thousand pages. 
The arrangement is alphabetical. There are numerous 
maps and illustrations. The Spanish- American War, 
the African complications, the affairs of Crete and 
Greece, are a few of the subjects dealt with at much 
length. The work will be found very useful for refer- 
ence, and to supplement the encyclopaedias. We trust 
that it will be continued annually. 

The American Book Co. send us a " Latin Prose Com-

LiITERARY NOTES. 



Chamisso's " Peter Schlemihl," in Dr. Hedge's trans- 
lation, has just been published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
in a small volume intended for school use. 

The second series of Dr. Edward Moore's " Studies in 
Dante " will be published at once by the Clarendon 
Press. These papers relate chiefly to the poet consid- 
ered as a religious teacher. 

" The Story of the Thirteen Colonies " and " The 
Story of the Great Republic," both by Miss H. A. 
Guerber, are two history readers for schools, published 
by the American Book Co. 

Milton's " Conius, Lycidas, and Other Poems," and 
Byron's " Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," both edited for 
school use by Mr. A. J. George, are the latest volumes 
in the " Pocket English Classics," published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Volume LVII. of " The Century Magazine," for the 
half-year ending last April, has just been sent us by the 
publishers. The recent war naturally occupies the chief 
place of interest among the contents, and makes the vol- 
ume particularly valuable as a work of reference. 

A sheaf of recent reports from the Field Columbian 
Museum include four numbers in the geological series, 
and five in the zoological series. They relate, for the 
most part, to investigations of the fossils and the living 
fauna of the Western States, the chief exception being 
an account of " The Ores of Colombia." 

Mr. Henry W. Elson's " Side Lights on American 
History " (Macmillan) is a good book to be put in the 
hands of young students for collateral reading. It 
deals, simply and interestingly, with nearly a score of 
subjects, among them being the alien and sedition laws, 
the conspiracy of Burr, Lafayette's visit to the United 
States, the Underground Railroad, and the Lincoln- 
Douglas debates. 

Still another edition of Fitz Gerald's " Omar " has 
been issued by Mr. T. B. Mosher, whose imprint has 
come to mean so much to lovers of beautiful books. It 
is an oblong tome of vest pocket dimensions, with a 
preface by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, a pronouncing 
vocabulary, the text of the so-called fifth edition, and 
the notes of the translator. All of this may be had for 
the modest sum of twenty-five cents. 

Messrs. Small, Maynard, & Co. announce that they 
have acquired the greater part of the publications of 
Messrs. Copeland & Day, who are retiring from busi- 
ness. The list is a good one, comprising books by 
Father Tabb, Messrs. Bliss Carman, Richard Burton, 
Miss Rayner, and Miss Guiney, besides Mr. Rosenfeld's 
" Songs from the Ghetto," and the exquisitely printed 
" English Love Sonnet " series. Miss Alice Brown's 
two volumes, " Meadow Grass " and " On the Road to 
Castaly," have been taken over by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co., the publishers of Miss Brown's recent 
successful " Tiverton Tales." 

Mr. Charles A. Eggert, of the Chicago High Schools, 
has sent us reprints of two of his recent papers one on 
Moliere's " Misanthrope " from " Modern Language 
Notes," and one on Goethe from " Americana Ger- 
manica." The latter is a reply to " The Case against 
Goethe," by Professor Dowden, and protests vigorously 
against the plea of that essay, although it seems to us 
that Professor Dowdeu's position as an advocatus diaboli 
in that case is not clearly enough recognized. In other 
words, the English scholar holds practically the view of 



Mr. Eggert, although for the special purpose of his 
essay he assumed a hypercritical standpoint. Mr. 
Eggert's two papers are interesting to us not alone for 
their intrinsic value, but still more so as illustrating the 
tendency of our secondary teachers to do good scholarly 
work. The number of men in our secondary schools 
who can do such work is growing yearly, and would 
grow much more rapidly were our school authorities 
wise enough to attract scholars to these posts by giving 
them the same freedom in their work as is accorded to 
instructors in the colleges.

What Makes a Novel Sell ? 



NO man can tell beforehand, though many can give reasons 
afterwards. But you can safely say that if in its pages some 
true picture of human existence is faithfully depicted, and if the 
emotions and sentiments included in the particular side of life 
treated are common to a sufficiently large portion of the reading 
public, that book is sure to be in demand. There are seven novels 
which, though recently published, are all meeting with such a 
demand at this moment, because each tells something that is true 
to life and tells it in an interesting way. "That Fortune" ($1.50), 
by Charles Dudley Warner, is a picture of the New York society 
millionaire's life; "The Awkward Age" ($1.50), by Henry James, 
is a story of London society life; "The Open Question" ($1.50), 
by Elizabeth Robins, asks, Shall relatives marry and transmit fam- 
ily inheritances? "Cromwell's Own" ($1.50), by Arthur Paterson, 
draws a stirring picture of love and war three hundred years ago ; 
"When the Sleeper Wakes" ($1.50), by H. G. Wells/ draws another 
picture, quite as stirring, of love and war two hundred years hence ; 
"Ragged Lady" ($1.75), by William Dean Howells, lays before 
you the character of a New England girl under varying circum- 
stances; and "The Dreamers: A Club" ($1.25), by John Kendrick 
Bangs, has many a true criticism of life and literature under its 
covering of pleasant humor that has no sting. Any or all of these 
books are to be had of booksellers, or direct from the publishers

THE ROBERT^CLARKE COMPANY 

EAST TENNESSEE AND THE CIVIL WAR. 

By Hon. OLIVER P. TEMPLE, author of " The Covenanter, the Cavalier, and the Puritan." 1 vol., 8vo, cloth. 

About 600 pages. Net 83.50 

The object of the author in this work is to portray the history of the determined struggle in East Tennessee 
for the preservation of the Union, and to set forth the unyielding constancy and the heroic sacrifices of the Union 
people in its behalf. No such splendid record of patriotic devotion can be found in our National annals. The 
author has had peculiar opportunities for describing the thrilling incidents connected with the war. He knew all 
the leading men, and most of them intimately. A native of East Tennessee himself, he is familiar with all the 
ways and habits of the people he describes. 

THE UNION LEADERS OF EAST TENNESSEE. 

By Hon. OLIVER P. TEMPLE, author of " East Tennessee and the Civil War," " The Covenanter, the Cavalier, 

and the Puritan." 1 vol., 8vo, cloth. About 600 pages. Net $3.50 

The object of this history is the portrayal of the group of strong, brave men who appeared in 1861 as the 

leaders of the people. In no part of the land could such a combination of dauntless courage, high ability, and 

iron determination have been found as within this small region of country. 

A REVIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES,

THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE MISSOURI 
COMPROMISE AND ITS REPEAL. 

By Mrs. ARCHIBALD Dixox. 8vo. Over 600 pages, 
uniform with recent editions of the works of Jeffer- 
son, Hamilton, etc $4.00 

The writer's purpose is to set forth the origin, the attendant 

circumstances, and the consequences of a measure the enact- 
ment of which proved the moat momentous and far-reaching 

event in American annals. The volume comprises more than 

six hundred large octavo pages, and we do the author but 

justice when we say that none of these pages could be spared. 

New York Sun. 

This volume tells the story of a great epoch and epoch- 
maker in American history. It appears peculiarly timely jnat 

at this crisis of our national development. Mrs. Dixon'a book 

will appeal to the student of history, and as a contribution to 

the literature of a generation before the war will find place in 

our public and private libraries. As a depository of facts, 

passions, and sentiments of the past, and a vivid reflection of 

the spirit of the South in slavery days, it will be an invaluable 

record. New York Times. 

"THE BIVOUAC OF THE DEAD," 
AND ITS AUTHOR. 

By GEORGE W. RANCH. 1 vol., 16mo, cloth extra, $1.00 
" On Fame's eternal camping-ground 

Their silent tents are spread. 
And Glory guards with solemn round 

The bivouac of the dead." 

The whole story of the poem is given, with a biography of 
the soldier-poet, compiled from family papers. This well- 
known lyric was a favorite of Grant, Lee, and Gladstone, and 
it has been styled " th* finest martial elegy in existence."

CHARACTER, NOT CREEDS. 

Reflections from Hearth and Plow-beam. By DANIKI. 
F. DE WOLF, A.M., Ph.D. 1 vol., 12mo, cloth, $1.25 
The purpose of the work is to emphasize the essential 
inter-dependence of the race, and the need of a great common 
purpose, unhampered by sectarian prejudice. 

" America belongs to her young men and women. Its rest- 
less spirit, largely aspiring, often surging toward dangerous 
social theories, demands well-studied, temperate effort to 
make the best of its aspirations and to avoid its dangers." 

INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF NORTH 

AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY. 
By Prof. CYRUS THOMAS, U. S. Bureau of American Eth- 
nology. 108 illustrations. 8vo, buckram cloth, 82.00 
Professor Thomas has in this convenient and attractive 
volume presented the public a brief rtsumt of the progress 
which has been made up to the present time in the investiga- 
tion and study of North American archaeology. No one could 
be more competent for such an undertaking. Great stores of 
information have been accumulated during recent years, and 
a trustworthy guide to their results, indicating the present 
state of knowledge on the subject, is called for. Such a guide 
is afforded by the present work, which supplies a real want.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



Following our midsummer custom of several 
years past, we have prepared a summary of the 
reports, published in the London "Athenaeum," 
upon the literary output of the past year in the 
most important European countries. These 
reports are so valuable that we offer no apology 
for making this condensation for the benefit of 
American readers, and we take pleasure in once 
more acknowledging our indebtedness to our 



English contemporary for the material which is 
here reproduced. Eleven countries are included 
this year, there being no reports from Bohemia, 
Greece, and Sweden. We follow the alpha- 
betical order, and include in this issue the facts 
relating to Belgium, Denmark, France, Ger- 
many, and Holland. The authors quoted from 
are, respectively, Professor Paul Fredericq, 
Dr. Alfred Ipsen, M. Jules Pravieux, Herr 
Ernst Heilborn, and Heer H. S. M. van Wicke- 
voort Crommelin. 

Belgium, mourning the loss of Georges 
Rodenbach, has given the world two posthu- 
mous books from his pen, " L'Arbre " and " Le 
Miroir du Ciel Natal." His name suggests 
that of M. Maeterlinck, whose " La Sagesse et 
la Destinee " is also a book of the past year. 
There have been a score or more volumes of 
verse, among them two by M. Etnile Verhaeren. 
In criticism, there is M. Fierens-Gevaert, who 
has " set himself to study the great moral and 
intellectual currents which influence literature 
at the end of our century," and has published 
his conclusions under the title of " La Tristesse 
Contemporaine." There have been many books 
of political and social science, one of them by 
M. W. J. Kerby, on the subject of " Le Social- 
isme aux Etats-Unis." The most important 
historical work of the year is a history of Bel- 
gium by M. Henri Pirenne, printed in German 
in advance of its appearance in French. Congo 
literature and the editing of many original 
documents are two departments of historical 
writing both of which are well represented. It 
is interesting to note that " the German move- 
ment along the frontier of the Rhine provinces 
of Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Luxem- 
bourg still continues." There is a periodical 
called " Deutsch Belgien," a review in both 
Flemish and German, called " Germania," and 
a five-act play, " Papst und Fiirst," by M. P. 
Bourg. On the Flemish side, there are chron- 
icled several collections of verse, such fiction as 
the "Lenteleven " of M. Stijn Streuvels and the 
posthumous stories of Mme. Cogen, and such 
miscellaneous volumes as M. Buysse's "Uit 
Vlaanderen " and M. Pol de Mont's " Inleiding 
tot de Poe'zie." The theatre is not neglected, 
as is attested by the Flemish stages of Brussels 
and Antwerp, soon to be followed by one in

Ghent, but good Flemish plays to produce in 
these theatres are still to seek. 

Denmark, we are told, " is by preference a 
lyrical nation." 

" Among our natural gift* are humor, a strong sense 
of irony, and a feeling for beauty and the contrast be- 
tween joy and melancholy. Our national character has 
often by our writers and poets been compared to the 
sea, the ever-wandering, ever-changing, and it is re- 
flected, as in a mirror, in our literary perfections and 
shortcomings, the glory of our literature being good, 
melodious verse, now heavy with melancholy, now care- 
less and unconcerned." 

The past year has produced " a rich crop of 
poetry," of which the most conspicuous exam- 
ples are Herr Rordam's retelling of the Beo- 
wulf story, the " Sirener " of Herr Michaelis, 
the " Portraits in Verse " of Herr Schandorph, 
and the " Digte " of Herr Jorgensen, most 
wonderful in his particular style of august 
serenity." As for fiction, the writer feels that 
in the best Danish work, if not so striking as 
the Norwegian, "there is something untrans- 
latable, something that will scarcely be felt and 
understood outside the borders of our small 
kingdom." The fiction particularly mentioned 
in this survey includes " A Recruit of '64," by 
Herr P. F. Rist ; " Donna Ysabel," a tale of 
the Peninsular War, by Fru Mailing; and 
Danske Maend," a study of low life in Copen- 
hagen, by Herr K. Larsen. The tendency, in 
spite of such works as the one last named, 
seems to be away from the bare realism of a 
few years ago, a fact which our writer rather 
regrets. The chief Danish writer of to-day is 
the critic, Dr. Georg Brandes, a complete uni- 
form edition of whose works is now in course of 
publication. Dr. Brandes has written a biog- 
raphy of Dr. Julius Lange, the late critic of 
art, and a pamphlet on " The Danishness of 
Sleswick." The latter work is 

" An address to Germany, in which the author reproaches 
the Germans for their system of oppression and acts of 
violence against the Danish in the conquered province, 
and compares German culture with Danish, not exactly 
to the credit of the former, showing how much the Ger- 
mans lack in different fields of spiritual culture, and 
how little, with their knowledge of history, they finder- 
stand their opponents." 

Finally, Herr Vilhelm Andersen has finished 
the first volume of a great critical and bio- 
graphical study of CEhlenschlager. 

"A certain case" has so monopolized the 
attention of the French poeple during the past 
year that literature " has had to give place to 
the excited manifestations of daily polemic." 

" Artists and thinkers have been living in an atmos- 
phere of contention. Who, then, could boast of retain- 



ing his calmness in the thick of a battle ? A glance at 
some recent publications, such as M. France's ' L'An- 
neau d'Ame'thyste,' for instance, will prove that the 
idealists most famous for the dile(tant<rcb&rncler of their 
convictions have not escaped the influence of their en- 
vironment. Writers who, if their past record means 
anything, seemed destined to seek nothing in life but 
new expressions of beauty, have shown their talents on 
a most unexpected side; they have revealed themselves 
to be brilliant and aggressive controversialists." 

The playwrights are the first to be noticed 
among the literary workers of the year. The 
most noteworthy dramas have been the " Nou- 
velle Idole " of M. Curel, the " Berceau " of 
M. Brieux, the " Vieux Marcheur " of M. La- 
vedan, the " Plus que Reine " of M. Bergerat, 
the " Judith Renaudin " of " Pierre Loti," the 
" Struense'e " of M. Paul Meurice, and the 
" Truands " of M. Jean Richepin. Of these, 
perhaps the most significant are the pieces of 
MM. Brieux and Meurice. The latter, which 
is in verse, " represents a return to the romantic 
manner of which Victor Hugo was the chief 
master. The best praise one can accord to 
4 Struensee ' is to say that the writer has dis- 
played in it some of Victor Hugo's lyric ardor." 
Of the play by M. Brieux, we are given the 
following interesting comment : 

44 He demands praise by his obstinate departure from 
beaten paths, his disdain of methods and recipes for 
winning the favor of the general public. All his pieces 
reveal an intention, an idea, a thesis. And in this con- 
nection the evolution our theatre is undergoing may 
well be stated. For a long while love was the sole 
thing our theatre lived on. No good pieces some years 
ago could do without an adulterer. Times have changed. 
Authors seem to be abandoning increasingly the formula 
of art for art's sake.' They wish to speak to the public, 
attack the follies of the age, lash the vices of certain 
social classes. It seems as if there was a tendency 
clearly defined towards the drama of ideas. This evo- 
lution of drama is very palpable in the pieces of M. 
Brieux. In Le Berceau ' his aim is to display the 
inconveniences of divorce. It is more like a disserta- 
tion than a play." 

The novel, also, has undergone an evolution 
not unlike that of the play. " The novelists 
have given up studying love only. They have 
set themselves free from the obsession of the 
Seventh Commandment." In this connection 
we will call attention to Mme. Darmesteter's 
discussion of the subject in the June " Con- 
temporary Review." The most important 
novels of the year are " La Duchesse Bleue," by 
M. Bourget ; " La Force," by M. Paul Adam ; 
"L' Anneau d'Ame'thyste," by M. France ; " Les 
Morts Qui Parlent," by M. de Vogue ; " La 
Terre Qui Meurt," by M. Rene* Bazin ; " Le 
Ferment," by M. Estaunie* ; "L'Arae d'un 
Enfant," by M. Jean Aicard ; and " Devant le

Bonheur," by M. Jean Thorel. Of M. de 
Vogue's book we read that the author 
" Is not afraid to approach serious social problems which 
agitate minds of to-day. He introduces us to the Palais 
Bourbon, which he frequented as a deputy during one 
legislature.' He has brought away melancholy reflec- 
tions. Still, it appears that he does not regret his excur- 
sion into the world of politics, since he returns to it with 
a book like ' Les Morts Qui Parlent.' In this new novel, 
which contains a delicate love interest closely welded 
with political intrigue, M. de Vogiie' shows once more 
his mastery, his unsurpassable talent for writing. Here 
is to be found the richness of style in which splendid 
images enchant you, enlivened by a breath of strong 
eloquence which bears up the ideas bravely. It is the 
book of a poet, an artist, an original and deep thinker. 
Politics, too, are touched on in ' L'Anneau d'Ame'thyste,' 
the third volume of the series which M. France has 
called ' Histoire Contemporaine,' which is a mordant 
satire on our faults and vices. The best thing in the 
book, the quite first-rate part, is contained in the comic 
scenes. M. France is an admirable writer of comedy. 
In his latest novel he shows himself a little more bitter 
and pessimistic than usual; but to set against this he 
presents readers with a sympathetic being, and that is a 
happy novelty ! " 

M. Estaunie's " Le Ferment " 
" Might be called a social novel. By ferment ' he 
means the restless, ardent intelligence of sons of work- 
men and peasants who have been taught too much, and 
had longings and desires unknown to their fathers de- 
veloped in them. M. Kstaunid studies the social crisis. 
He uses his realistic talent with moderation in order to 
display the debasement of those who are mixed up in 
the desperate struggle of ambitions and appetites." 

The French poets have not been idle, although 
nothing very noteworthy has been done by them. 
Mention is made of " La Chanson de la Bre- 
tagne," by M. A. Le Braz ; of " Les Poemes 
de 1' Amour et la Mort," by M. Lebey ; of "La 
Chanson des Hommes," by M. Maurice Magre ; 
of " Artiste et Poete," by M. Jean Bach-Sisley ; 
of " L'Ideale Jeunesse," by M. Montier ; and of 
" Paysages et Paysans," by M. Maurice Rol- 
linat, who " has been styled the pupil of George 
Sand and Edgar Poe." There has also been 
published " Les Annees Funestes," a posthu- 
mous volume by Hugo. In literary history and 
criticism there are such books as the new series 
of " Impressions de Theatre," by M. Jules 
Lemaitre ; the " Racine," by M. Larroumet ; 
the " Essai sur Goethe," by M. Edouard Rod ; 
and the " De Dumas a Rostand," by M. Au- 
guste Filon. In the domain of a stricter scholar- 
ship, there are M. Masson's "Josephine de 
Beauharnais," M. Houssaye's " Waterloo," M. 
Demolins's " Les Franc,ais d'Aujourd'hui," 
and " L'Education Nouvelle," M. Fouillee's 
"Les Etudes Classiques et la Democratic," 
and M. Laffite's " Le Faust de Goethe." A 
book not easily classified, but which must be 



mentioned, is M. Coppee's " La Bonne Souf- 
france," in which the author, " in a familiar 
and often eloquent style, tells the occasion and 
influences which resulted in his return to the 
Faith." Concluding his review, the writer says : 

" In France there are no longer literary schools, though 
it is easy to recognize c tendencies.' It would be a para- 
doxical and most unjust thing to say that all the literary 
schools which have come forth and had their day of 
glory in our times have gone bankrupt. They have 
undergone the law of evolution; they have disappeared 
in obedience to the manifestations of a new code of lit- 
erary aesthetics, or, in plain terms, because the public 
have gone after new gods. Certainly M. Zola, the head 
of the realistic school, and M. Bourget, the undisputed 
master of the psychological novel, have not stopped 
writing (and of that we are very glad) ; but who of the 
young novelists makes their methods his model ? There 
are no more schools because no more masters are wanted 
in literature. The first act of a writer born into the 
literary world is to declare his independence, and assert, 
as best he can, his autonomy. In the novel, in poetry, 
history, philosophy, criticism, isolation is the thing, and 
everyone is at least an individualist." 

The past year in Germany witnessed the 
death of Bismarck, and gave us his memoirs, 
" Bismarck, the Man and Statesman." 

" His monument is composed of no perishable mate- 
rial, and its construction reveals his individuality, even 
in the smallest details. Everything in this book is per- 
sonal. The five-and-twenty years and more of German 
and other than German history became a mirror of his 
personality. Actions and men appear as he saw them, 
and he allows them to be rated at no other value. . . . 
He disliked fine phrases, and the result was a feeling of 
distrust for mere phrase-making in literature. His 
politics were concerned with actualities; literature, too, 
was reared on a basis of fact. Fidelity to nature be- 
came the catchword. Active, unsentimental characters 
rose in general esteem; the sentimental went out of 
favor. And as so often happens, in the attempt to root 
out the weeds the flowers too suffered. Not only senti- 
mentality, but also noble and right feeling, or at any 
rate its expression, was tabooed. The young literature 
of the eighties made no mention of feeling. It expresses 
a skepticism which, however, yielded humbly before the 
advent of reality, one in which the peculiarity of Bis- 
marck's personality had its full share." 

The death of Theodor Fontane also serves to 
mark the past year. 

" He lived just long enough to write a charming little 
ode on the statesman's death, then he too passed away. 
Only a few weeks before his death his autobiographical 
sketches ' Von Zwanzig bis Dreissig ' appeared. Before 
his last novel ' Der Stechlin ' left the press we had stood 
beside his grave. It is impossible to make those of 
another nation understand what Fontane was and still is 
to us. He was distinctly a North German, Prussian, even 
Brandenburg writer, and even in Vienna he attracted 
little notice. But we loved him, and named him the 
best among us. He depicted the men whom we know 
as we see or should wish to see them. He was a distinct 
realist, but his realism had a subjective character." 

The most important works of pure literature 



68 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



have been two plays Herr Hauptmann's 
"Fuhrmann Henschel" and Herr Sudermann's 
** Die Drei Reiherfedern." The former is thus 
described : 

" Henschel's wife when dying forces him to promise 
that after her death he will not marry the girl who U at 
this time in their service. He promises, and his wife 
dies. But his household cannot get on without a woman, 
the child needs a mother, and he marries the servant 
after all. Then she deceives him, makes his life a bur- 
den, and stirs up strife between her husband and his 
friends and neighbors. One day at the inn he has a 
quarrel with his brother-in-law, who tells him the truth 
about his wife. He demands proofs and sends for his 
wife, and she can find no defence. Then the truth 
flashes on him either he or bis wife must die. So he 
goes away and hangs himself." 

As Herr Sudermann's first novel was called 
** Frau Sorge," his latest play might well be 
styled " Frau Sehnsucht." 

It leads Sudermann back to the moods of his youth, 
and restores the elements of lyric feeling and person- 
ality which were so regrettably wanting in his recent 
successful plays. All the same, the new play is a 
failure; it lacks clearness, and with it scenic effective- 
ness and human interest. But the element of longing 
has been fathomed to its depths. It is this unending 
desire that drives the young Northern hero Prince 
Witte ceaselessly about the world; it is the eternal 
tragedy of the delusion of desire that prevents him, 
when once he has attained the idol of his longings, from 
recognizing his dream, and he casts it from him to pur- 
sue the phantom once more. 

Other plays are " Die Gefahrtin " and " Das 
Gemachtniss," both by Herr Arthur Schnitz- 
ler ; " Die Hoohzeit der Sobeide," by Herr 
Hugo von Hof mannsthal ; " Herostrat," by 
Herr Ludwig Fulda ; " Die Heimathslosen," 
by Herr Max Halbe ; and " Gewitternacht," 
a patriotic tragedy of the Silesian wars, by 
Herr Ernst von Wildenbruch. In poetry, 
there are three small volumes by Herr Stefan 
George, who is compared with Rossetti. In 
fiction, a new volume of stories by Herr Paul 
Heyse is called "Der Sohn Seines Vaters." 
Other fiction includes two volumes of stories 
by Frau Lou Andreas-Salome', Herr Raabe's 
" Hastenbeck," a story of the Seven Years' 
War, Herr Wilbrandt's "Vater Robinson," 
Fraulien Bohlau's Halbtier," Fraulein Fra- 
pan's "Wir Haben Kein Vaterland," Herr 
Lindau's "Agent," and Herr Spielhageu's 
Urn-ill ." Finally, a book of the deepest 
interest is Frau von Meysenbug's " Lebensa- 
bend einer Idealistin." 

"Malvida von Meysenbug, the friend of Richard 
Wagner, Nietzsche, and Mazzini, was also an advanced 
woman. This noble lady, who freed herself from the 
narrow conditions of her home, and lived in London 
among the political exiles, helping on their schemes, 
also turned her thoughts to female education, and never 



shrank from entering the lists for her ideas. But this 
1 Lebensabeud,' the sequel to the Meinoiren eiuer Ideal- 
istin," is a book of peace. She presents charming pic- 
tures of her intercourse with Wagner and Nietzsche, 
Mazzini and Liszt; but what is specially charming abuut 
this book, in spite of its somewhat highflown manner, is 
the evidence that she has attained contentment and 
inward freedom in herself." 

In the report upon Dutch literature, the first 
place is given to Heer Paap's anti-Semitic 
novel, "Vincent Haman," which is " a violent 
attack on the leaders of modern literature." 
There is not much good original work to men- 
tion. Volumes of verse are Dr. van Eeden's 
"Enkele Verzen," Helene Lapidoth-Swarth's 
" Stille Dalen," Heer Albert Verwey's " De 
Nieuwe Tuin," Mr. G. C. van 't Hoog's " Ge- 
luk," and Miss Reyneke van Stuwe's " Impres- 
sies." The stage has witnessed two important 
productions Breero's "Spaansche Brabanter" 
and Mr. H. Heyermans's " Ghetto." 

" From poetry to prose Dr. van den Bergh van Eys- 
inga has built a golden bridge with bis ' Boek van 
Toevertrouwen,' an elaborate specimen of lyric prose, 
the work of a clergyman under strong Biblical infiuence. 
It breathes soothing confidence and hope, real faith and 
firm conviction." 

The most erudite and entertaining book of the 
year is Professor van Hamel's " Letterkundig 
Leven van Frankrijk." Professor P. L. Mul- 
ler's " great popular history, * Onze Gouden 
Eeuw,' describing the rise, growth, and the 
beginning of decay of Holland at her best, is 
now completed. The last volume, which deals 
with the government, life, religion, and morals 
of our ancestors, is perhaps the most interest- 
ing of the three." Last of all, we mention 
two essays in ecclesiastical history, " Rome en 
de Geschiedenis " and " Petrns en Rome," both 
by Professor Bolland of Leyden, which have 
given rise to a violent controversy between the 
conservative and advanced schools of religious 
thought. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

THE PROBLEM OP CHILDREN'S BOOKS. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Your recent suggestive article upon Boys and (iirls 
and Books, referring to the differences in the literary 
tastes of high-school pupils, leads one to inquire whether 
these differences are not due in a greater measure to the 
pupil's earlier training than to his native bias. 

The mind of a child is formed as his muscles are 
formed by food and exercise; and his earliest mental 
pabulum is supplied by the jingles of the nursery, and 
by the classic tales which are selected, it is to be hoped, 
by a judicious mother. At this age he becomes acquainted 
with Mother Goose, and there is nothing better for him, 
provided always it is the real simon-pure Mother Goose,

and not the miscellaneous stuff which masquerades in 
cheap editions under that name. The parent must not 
think that any story which will amuse a child is useful. 
The individual taste has not at this period of develop- 
ment become pronounced; the child will accept any- 
thing eagerly; a story is a story. But the influence of 
the stories which are told him is deep and lasting. If 
he is fed upon tales of ogres and giants who eat up little 
boys, a taste is formed which will continue to demand 
extravagant and blood-curdling fiction. Jack the Giant 
Killer is the logical antecedent of Jack the Indian Killer 
and Jack the Ripper, which our children see a little 
later upon the news-stands, more 's the pity. We 
sometimes ask why these outrageous yellow-covered 
tales are written; but the explanation is quite easy. 
There is a demand for them; and we should see to it 
that the demand is not fostered by the tales which our 
children hear from their nurses in the days before the 
little ones can read for themselves. 

The next important step in the formation of the child's 
taste is taken when he finds out the meaning of the 
printed word and wanders away from his school reader 
to test for himself his newly acquired powers. This is 
the point at which the child particularly needs help. 
Doubtless some latitude should be allowed to him in the 
selection of his reading matter. If he himself chooses 
one from a half-dozen books, all of which are equally 
good, the chances are that he will better enjoy the read- 
ing of it and will get more real good from it than if it 
were presented to him alone as something to be read 
because of the good it would do him. Do not make his 
reading a duty, but let it be a privilege and a pleasure. 
He may prefer Robinson Crusoe to Pilgrim's Progress, 
and if he does he should be allowed to read it. But 
beware how widely his choice is allowed to extend. 
Fruits are good for children, but there are unripe 
fruits and there are partly decayed fruits which are not 
good. The average parent will be quite careful as to 
what his children are putting into their stomachs, but is 
apt to be equally careless as to their mental fare. 

The boy-baudit, wild-west, sensational stories of the 
news-stands, to which reference has already been made, 
are not, after all, the most dangerous species of chil- 
dren's literature. They are so glaringly bad that par- 
ents instinctively scent their presence and banish them 
from the household. Their influence is happily becom- 
ing limited to those homes in which the parents them- 
selves are not above the moral standard of the tales, 
and in such homes there is little chance for the growth 
of a pure literary taste or a high moral character. It 
will be observed that the influence of all literature is 
felt along these two lines, the jesthetic and the moral: 
that which affects the taste and that which affects the 
character. While these remarks apply chiefly to the 
aesthetic influence, the two are so blended that it be- 
comes quite impossible to avoid reference to the moral 
influence as well. That which we love, we are. 

The most dangerous class of children's literature is 
that in which sensationalism is respectably clothed. 
There are stories quite as bad in their influence as the 
border-ruffian type, but more refined in their setting. 
The boys and girls move in good society, but they are 
always getting into the most impossible situations and 
having the most startling adventures, hair-breadth 
escapes, encounters with burglars, and all that sort of 
thing. These stories appear in reputable children's 
magazines, and are interspersed with items of useful 
information science, history, and biography. The 



story is inserted to make the magazine popular; and it 
answers its purpose. In the family of my friend A, 
three well-known children's periodicals are taken and 
read. Several days before the time for the appearance 
of each issue, the children are in a fever of excitement; 
and when the paper at last appears, everything is dropped 
until the fate of the hero of the continued story is ascer- 
tained. In this family there is no library worthy of the 
name. The periodicals already referred to supply all the 
reading matter for which the children care, or for which 
they have time after their school duties are fulfilled. 

But while this sugar-coated sensationalism is bad, 
there is another class of children's literature which is 
quite as objectionable. I refer to the sentimental stuff 
which is written in the name of religion and morality, 
but which is effective only in vitiating the taste, weak- 
ening the intellect, and giving false views of life. It 
appears notably in the " children's column " of certain 
religious papers, and in books intended for Sunday- 
school consumption, which, happily, the best Sunday- 
schools have long ago repudiated and cast out. 

It is one of the most significant facts of modern life, 
that a surfeit of periodical literature, both juvenile and 
adult, is operating against the reading of books and 
the formation of libraries. The magazine has its place, 
but it also has its limitations; and we should lead our 
children to understand that, after all, the vital and per- 
manent literature is that preserved for them in good 
books. Let every child have his little book-case in the 
nursery, or, better yet, a shelf in the library which he 
may call his own. Let him be encouraged to read good 
books and to care for them. He will then come to feel 
the friendship with them which is the greatest joy of the 
literary life. A good book presented to a child on each 
succeeding birthday a book chosen wisely with respect 
to the child's tastes and abilities, but of sterling worth 
will soon put him in possession of a library which will 
be a lasting source of strength and satisfaction. It is 
a mistake to think that the child must be continually 
supplied with fresh reading matter, that a book once 
read is finished. Indeed, the strong intellects of the 
last century are those which have been nourished in 
childhood upon a few good books, read and re-read 
until the thought and style became a part of the read- 
er's permanent possession. Nor does a child lose interest 
in a good book after a single reading. What boy ever 
tired of Gulliver's Travels ? 

Such books as those of Kingsley, Church, and Jane 
Andrews, Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare and Adven- 
tures of Ulysses, the fairy tales of Andersen and 
Grimm, .<Esop's Fables, Robinson Crusoe and the Swiss 
Family Robinson, Pilgrim's Progress, Franklin's Auto- 
biography, Tom Brown at Rugby, and the stories of 
Scott and Dickens, all these are genuine classics, and 
they never grow old. Then there is a multitude of new 
books written for children by men and women who love 
and understand the needs of child-life. Never was 
there a wider range of selection, and never a time when 
the possession of children's libraries was so inexcusable. 

While nothing can quite take the place of the library 
in the home, the best substitute for it is the library in 
the school. Educational sentiment is alert upon this 
subject, and the growth of school libraries during the 
past decade is a hopeful sign, not only of a healthier 
literary taste, but of a sounder morality in the men and 
women of the next generation.

DANTON AS MAN AND LEADER.* 

A writer of biography is fortunate if his hero 
lived in a period of tragic events, when the 
problem of public conduct was complex and 
baffling ; for it is singularly interesting to study 
the behavior of character subjected to extraor- 
dinary strain. The men of the French Revolu- 
tion certainly fell upon such times. It was not 
theirs simply to fight for recognized liberties 
against an encroaching government, as the 
English, and more recently the Americans, 
had fought before. When these Frenchmen 
attempted the task, the very foundations of 
society crumbled beneath their feet, and while 
they looked about for a footing they saw all 
Europe advancing in arms toward their fron- 
tiers. Beset by fears, jealousies, and hatreds, 
they were driven to form opinions while stand- 
ards of judgment were changing ; they must 
act, though the objects which France sought 
to-day might be abandoned tomorrow. 

To change the direction of the thought if 
one would penetrate the secret of the Revolu- 
tion the surest path is along the line of just 
such individual experience, following ade- 
quately tested men into the " welter," and inter- 
preting its nature and tendencies by its effects 
upon them. It is strange, therefore, that so 
few biographies of the Revolutionists have been 
written, even in France. Without prejudging 
the two volumes under review, it may be said 
that no satisfactory life of Danton has yet ap- 
peared. The works of Aulard, Robinet, and 
Bongeart are rather studies of aspects of his 
life than complete descriptions of it. They are, 
moreover, chiefly attempts to meet the charges 
which have always been brought against him. 

Mr. Beesly and Mr. Belloc, who seek to bring 
to English readers the results of the later inves- 
tigations in France, are both enthusiastic ad- 
mirers of the great Cordelier. Mr. Beesly's 
book is distinctly apologetic from beginning to 
end, although a biographical study with 
apology as its dominant note is itself a damag- 
ing criticism of its hero. This is not altogether 
Mr. Beesly's fault, because any bold strong 
man who rose to leadership during such days 
could hardly come through without leaving 
some memories to trouble zealous eulogists.

enbury Scholar of Balliol College, Oxford. New York : Chariot 
Scribner'a Sons. 

LIFE or DANTON. 87 A. H. Beesly. New York : Long- 
mails, Green, A Co. 



It was first as a dramatic poet, in his " Danton 
and Other Verse," that Mr. Beesly seems to 
have approached his hero. In this new vol- 
ume he shows a wide familiarity with French 
researches, but he has apparently paid little 
attention to the documentary sources of inform- 
ation, aside from the " Moniteur," which he 
has used for Danton's speeches. And his use 
of the " Moniteur " is not critical, else, for ex- 
ample, he would not have fallen into the com- 
mon error of attributing the phrase " Plarons 
la terreur a 1'ordre du jour " to Berrere, who 
merely quoted it from an orator of the Com- 
mune in September, 1793. 

Consciously or unconsciously, Mr. Beesly has 
sought to palliate the darker deeds of the Revo- 
lution by setting everything of the Old Regime 
in a dismal light. He begins with a miscel- 
laneous assortment of evils and an incredible 
story or two. He says Louis XIV. left France 
" two and one-half milliards of debt," and that 
the Regency added to this 750 millions. With- 
out another word of explanation he remarks, 
" But the Queen went on gambling," as if the 
years from 1723 to 1774 were dropped out 
entirely. When he reaches the overthrow of 
the monarchy, August 10, instead of a word of 
pity for the poor old king, he gathers from the 
gossip of the memoir writers four pages, giving 
the impression that Louis was a boorish, greedy, 
cruel nobody. 

Mr. Belloc's " Study " of Danton is a more 
important contribution to the subject, for by 
his own independent investigations he has been 
able to control and occasionally to supplement 
his French predecessors. His treatment reveals 
vigorous thinking and clear conceptions of 
many of the characteristic features of the great 
struggle. There are passages of remarkable de- 
scriptive power, sometimes rising to eloquence. 
This is particularly true of the chapter on the 
death of Danton. Here and there a phrase 
gathers the significance of all the varied inci- 
dents of a whole situation. But besides these 
good qualities there are certain surprising de- 
fects. And, first, inaccuracies. Such things 
as " jerrymander," " Golier " for Gohier, and 
" suppliants " for suppleants, are probably mere 
misprints. But on page 218 he says Danton 
opposed, April 10, the " prosecution of those 
who sent a petition from the Halle aux Blcs 
for the resignation of Roland." Now Roland 
had resigned January 22. Moreover, this pe- 
tition was not sent in ; it was discovered by 
1 V t ion while it was being circulated, who asked 
that its authors be prosecuted. Danton's inter-

vention was accidental and had no significance, 
for he had not heard the first part of the peti- 
tion, in which the offensive words occurred, and 
misunderstood the intent of the discussion. A 
cursory reading of the Moniteur would have 
set the author right. 

A similar blunder occurs on page 179, in 
speaking of Gohier's report on the "civil list." 
Here Mr. Belloc was misled by a statement in 
one of Aulard's articles in the " Revolution 
frangaise." The formal report did not come 
out August 18, as Mr. Belloc says, but on 
September 16. However, Gohier had outlined 
the discoveries in August, though not for the 
first time on the date Mr. Belloc suggests, but 
several days earlier. M. Aulard quoted only 
from " Moniteur XIII., 445," though he might 
have found practically the same statements in 
an earlier reference, " Moniteur XIII., 430." 
In Mr. Belloc's footnote the reference is 
" Moniteur XII., 445." 

Errors of this sort are of minor importance. 
But when Mr. Belloc attempts to answer the 
question concerning the consequences of Valmy, 
" Why then did the King of Prussia retreat ? " 
he becomes puerile. He gives the credit to 
Danton which belongs to Dumouriez, confuses 
dates and incidents, and sacrifices clearness to 
mere phrasing. What can anybody make out 
of a sentence like this, in reference to D'Eglan- 
tine's mission to compose the jealous ambitions 
of Kellerman and Dumouriez : " That foolish 
man, D'Eglantine, followed him, but his folly 
was swallowed up in the wisdom of Danton, 
who sent him," etc. 

It is impossible here to more than allude to 
Mr. Belloc's inadequate treatment of the First 
Committee of Public Safety, of which Danton 
was the most influential member. He seems to 
have laid little emphasis in his studies on the 
records and correspondence of the Committee 
itself, edited by M. Aulard. Otherwise he 
would hardly have so greatly over-estimated 
the importance of Berrere's report in behalf of 
the Committee, presented May 29. He has 
printed long extracts from this iii an Appendix, 
under the erroneous impression that it had never 
been printed elsewhere. 

Vigorous and clear as Mr. Belloc's style is in 
many passages, it occasionally becomes meta- 
phorical, oracular, and bombastic. He remarks 
that Danton was chary of metaphor, a virtue 
he might have himself better appreciated. A 
few rhetorical curiosities are worth mentioning. 
" When spring had melted their enthusiasm " 
almost defies analysis. This seems a little thing 



compared with the following, apropos of the 
Flight to Varennes : 

" France was also afraid. . . . She feared the divine 
sunstroke that threatens the road to Damascus. In that 
passage which was bounded on either side by an abyss, 
her feet went slowly, one before the other, and she 
looked backward continually. In the twisting tides at 
night her one anchor to the old time was the monarchy. 
Thus when Louis fled the feeling was of a prop broken." 

Here is a delightful going and coming of the 
fancy from sacred to profane, from land to sea, 
and back again. In another case the author is 
obliged to escape from his metaphor argumenta- 
tively, and by main strength, as it were. A 
quarrel between Paris and the departments he 
says " would have been a fight between the 
members and the brain, and the brain would 
have died fighting, leaving a body dead because 
the brain had died." The anatomical impos- 
sibilities of such an affair quite make one forget 
Paris and the departments and Danton himself, 
so that one must finally go back to find what 
it is all about. 

Both writers under consideration would have 
made Danton's earlier career more comprehen- 
sible had they explained at somewhat greater 
length the municipal history of Paris in 1789 
and 1790. This is not so difficult to do, now 
that many of the records have been edited. 
And without such an explanation one starts out 
with the impression that Danton was merely a 
noisy demagogue, though with greater legal acu- 
men and more ability than some of the others. 

The word " September " is after all the ugli- 
est obstacle for a Danton biographer to sur- 
mount. Few writers now accuse him of direct 
complicity in the massacres. But some years 
ago, when it was proposed to name a new street 
near Danton's house after the great Revolu- 
tionist, there was a lively debate in the Senate, 
and the distinguished historian, M. Wallon, 
refused to be convinced that Danton was not 
their real author. He suggested six panels for 
the pedestal of a Danton statue : " Massacre 
de 1'Abbaye, Massacre des Carmes, Massacre 
de la Force," etc. Both Mr. Belloc and Mr. 
Beesly advocate the theory that, in the perilous 
situation of Paris, Danton did not dare antago- 
nize the bloodthirsty radicals who hounded on 
the mob to these murders. This is according 
to the evidence or rather the absence of evi- 
dence, but there is a suggestion in a part of 
the record of the Commune on the first day of 
the massacres which is significant. The Com- 
mune sent to rescue innocent prisoners for 
debt : it seemed at first indifferent to the fate 
of the political prisoners who were regarded as

criminal conspirators. Danton probably shared 
this first impulse, realizing only later, to use 
the words of Belloc, - that a thing had hap- 
pened which was to hurt the future of the Rev- 
olution more than all the armies." This reaction 
must have been for him, as for the rest, " like 
the breaking of day after that moral night." 

When a brief history of the First Committee 
of Public Safety was published some time ago, 
M. Aulard remarked how hazardous it was to 
attempt such a task without spending years in 
the archives. This reveals also the difficulty of 
doing more than scratch the surface of Danton's 
work in the First Committee. Here these two 
books show their least satisfactory pages. 

In spite of the defects and inadequacies 
already noted, the large and generous outlines 
of Danton's figure as a man and as a political 
leader are fairly clear in these volumes, and 
the reader confined to English descriptions of 
the great Cordelier will find in them the first 
opportunity to gain a modern view of him based 
on the results of the critical scholarship of 
France. The writers will have done a service 
to the popular understanding of Revolutionary 
history if they have succeeded in dissolving that 
figment of uninstructed imagination, the Tri- 
umvirate, Danton, Robespierre, Marat.

I.ATE BOOKS ON ALASKA.* 



The historian, in his survey of the history of 
the United States for this century, will remark 
two epoch-making years, namely, 1861, the 
outbreak of the Civil War as resistance to con- 
traction, and 1898 as a positive movement 
toward expansion in the Spanish War and the 
great influx into the Alaskan Gold Fields. The 
literature of this latter phase has been lately 
increased by four books of note, which treat 
the subject from different points of view. Mr. 
Hamlin Garland, in The Trail of the Gold- 
seekers," deals with the great Alaskan rush 
from the point of view of the literary man, and 
gives us a work of real and vivid power, at 
once poetic, romantic, realistic. The larger

part of the book is taken up with the descrip- 
tion of the trail by the inland route through 
British Colombia to Glenora on the Stikine. 
This story of the trail through savage wilder- 
ness and pleasant land is well told, and inter- 
spersed with bits of impromptu verse, which 
are not without charm. The migration of hu- 
man beings often became a craze. 

" I had been among the miners and hunters for four 
months. I had been one of them. I had lived the 
essentials of their lives, and had been able to catch from 
them some hint of their outlook on life. They were a 
disappointment to me in some ways. They seemed like 
mechanisms. They moved as if drawn by some great 
magnet whose centre was Dawson City. They appeared 
to drift on and in toward that human maelstrom, going 
irresolutely to their rutn. They did not seem to me 
strong men, on the contrary, they seemed weak men, 
or men strong with one insane purpose. They set 
their faces toward the Golden North, and went on 
through every obstacle like men dreaming, like som- 
nambulists, bending their backs to the most crushing 
burdens, their faces distorted with effort. ' On to 
Dawson! ' < To the Klondike! ' that was all they knew." 

From Glenora Mr. Garland went by water to 
Skagway, and thence to the Atlin Lakes, where 
the scenery greatly impressed him. The story 
of his horse Ladrone makes a very pretty tale. 
The book has no map. 

"Alaska and the Klondike," by Professor 
Angelo Heilprin, the distinguished geologist, is 
written from the scientific point of view, de- 
scribing the journey to Dawson as made in 
1898 by way of the White Pass and out by the 
Chilkoot. The author made a stay of some 
weeks in Dawson, which he quite fully de- 
scribes, and he found the summer weather and 
scenery superb. 

" For hours at a time could I sit watching the exqui- 
site beauty of the landscape; and to one endowed with 
a proper appreciation for the works of quiet nature it 
would be difficult to recommend a more enjoyable exer- 
cise than to take in a bit of this wonderful land of the 
North, and with it a mellow sunshine that is not to be 
found elsewhere. The jays and cross-bills are gambolling 
in the thickets back of you, the merry hum of the saw- 
mill breaks the stillness of the day below; but far off a 
peace and quiet reigns impressive by their silence. With 
a claim to having seen many distant lands, I can truth- 
fully say that never before has it been my fortune to 
experience such a succession of wonderful summer days 
as during my stay in the region about Dawson." 

Professor Heilprin examined the Klondike 
Gold Fields and reports on their geology and 
on the methods of working. The style of the 
book is at times diffuse, strained, and affected. 
Maps and illustrations are good. 

In " Two Women in the Klondike," by Mrs. 
Roswell D. Hitchcock, we have the Alaskan 
trip of 1898 from the feminine point of view.

THE DIAL

This diary of a tour to Dawson by way of the 
Yukon and out by the White Pass is full of 
petty details and small adventures. Yet, though 
lacking in artistic selection and compression, it 
is still attractive as a vivid picture of interest- 
ing scenes and personalities. So, also, the con- 
stantly effervescing jollity, humor, enthusiasm, 
and optimism of these two travelled ladies 
who are " doing " the Klondike as " a lark " 
make pleasant and amusing reading. We 
cannot say that we gain much information, but 
we certainly derive considerable entertainment 
from this work. The many illustrations are 
for the most part indifferent. 

Mr. Miner Bruce's book on Alaska is a hand- 
book to the Territory from the point of view of 
the practical man. It contains instructive chap- 
ters on the history, animals, inhabitants, and 
minerals of Alaska, with special directions to 
prospectors. Illustrations and maps are satis-

RECENT FICTION.* 



" The Fortnightly Review " has been publishing, 
for some months past, a serial novel called "The Indi- 
vidualist," and attributed to " Wentworth Moore." 
The novel was printed in small type, and the pages 
had a leaden look, which circumstances have, we 
imagine, prevented many readers from making its 
acquaintance. Those who were not deterred by its 
forbidding accidents, however, probably recognized 
a familiar voice speaking under an unfamiliar mask, 
and had little difficulty in reading Mr. W. H. Mai- 
lock for " Wentworth Moore." The mask is now 
removed, and the novel, acknowledged by its author, 
appears in book form, with a few added pages, and 
the new title of " Tristram Lacy ; or, The Individ- 
ualist." It is certainly a novel that the reader can-

not afford to miss. The leaden effect becomes less 
noticeable upon closer acquaintance, and attracts 
less attention than the remarkable finish of the style. 
The defects of Mr. Mallock's qualities are clearly 
exhibited, and there runs through the book a faint 
streak of what must be called nastiness which 
will be no discovery to readers of the author's pre- 
vious books. But, on the other hand, the peculiar 
satirical gift of the writer is exhibited almost as 
brilliantly as in the pages of " The New Republic," 
and constitutes the real strength of " Tristram 
Lacy," although the interest of the story is itself 
considerable. In this case, the social reformer is 
the target at which Mr. Mallock aims his shafts, and 
their penetrative force is not to be denied. Various 
types of reformers are satirized, and particularly the 
advanced woman who delights in vague abstractions 
about the new gospel of altruism and the uplifting 
of the masses through the blessed instrumentality of 
culture. The character of Mrs. Norham is one of 
the most effective pieces of satirical delineation with 
which we are acquainted. But if the doings of these 
people were all, the book would prove monotonous 
reading ; fortunately, Mr. Mallock has enough of 
artistic tact to diversify his scenes, and bring 
together a great variety of other social types, includ- 
ing a Prime Minister of England, into interesting 
relations with each other. Still, the book is essen- 
tially one of discussion rather than of action, and, 
aside from its effective scene-setting, appeals almost 
wholly to the intellectual sense. It is a book which, 
with its obvious defects, will be found enjoyable by 
cultivated readers in proportion to their degree of 
cultivation and the closeness of the attention they 
give to the perusal. It is certainly one of the nota- 
ble novels of the year. 

Mr. Legge's " Mutineers " is, like the book just 
mentioned, preoccupied with the social problem, but 
the treatment is conventional and dull. The hero, 
who is the chief mutineer, is a rather sullen and 
unattractive person, and the heroine, who begins by 
exciting our sympathies, soon forfeits them by a 
marriage into which no girl of fine feelings could

possibly enter. There is a great deal of assorted 
agony in the book, and a rather lame working-out 
of the plot The story is one of English society in 
our own time. 

"The Fowler" offers a pathetic illustration of 
what follows when a slender talent is stretched be- 
yond its limits. When Miss Harraden's " Ships That 
Pass in the Night " caught the capricious favor of 
the public, and, pretty as the story was, received 
ten times the praise that was rationally its due, the 
writer could do no less than attempt to justify all 
this laudation by planning a new book upon a more 
liberal scale. The result of this misdirected ambi- 
tion is a novel in which the characters have no 
vitality and slight individuality, all speaking the 
same language, and all the merest puppets in the 
hands of the show-woman. We hesitate to describe 
in these terms what is no doubt a conscientious piece 
of workmanship, but Miss Harraden's failure is so 
obvious that it seems best to mince no words about 
it. The heroine is a young woman whose weakness 
in allowing herself to become ensnared flatly con- 
tradicts everything that we are told about her char- 
acter ; the villain-hero, who is crafty enough to en- 
snare the heroine, is yet such a fool as to write a 
detailed description of his methods in a private 
journal and send it to the young woman by mistake. 
In her conception of this character, we cannot help 
thinking that Miss Harraden has been unconsciously 
influenced by " The Tormentor " of Mr. Benjamin 
Swift, for the two figures are fundamentally akin, 
although the latter has some reality about him, while 
the former has almost none. 

It is difficult to speak kindly of such a book as 
The Maternity of Harriott Wicken," in spite of 
the writer's obvious talent for vivid portraiture and 
striking dramatic effect. The objection to this novel 
is not that it deals with people who have their being 
in an uninteresting section of middle-class society, 
or even that its method of treatment is that of re- 
morseless realism. The objection is rather that the 
author takes a wanton delight in the introduction of 
sordid and offensive bits of detail, not necessary 
for the development of her conception, and, it would 
seem, deliberately calculated to make her work re- 
pulsive. The life which she depicts is a sort of 
dismal swamp of dank sliminess and miasmatic exha- 
lations. There is no more art about it than there 
is about the crudest of M. Zola's productions ; there 
is only a certain crude and brutal power which fas- 
cinates but does not impress. Dealing with a prob- 
lem which above all others calls for delicate treat- 
ment, the writer knows nothing of reticence, and 
defeats her own ethical purpose. Her pages are 
thronged with horrors which the sunlight of life 
never softens. If the world were such a charnel- 
house as this depressing book would have us think, 
the process of putrefaction would long since have 
exterminated our race. 

American fiction is setting a higher mark every 
year for the historical novel, and the charge that 
our writers are neglecting their opportunities in this 



field is losing its force. Such recent books as Dr. 
Mitchell's Hugh Wynne " and Miss Johnston's 
" Prisoners of Hope " gave us a new sense of the 
possibilities of our colonial past as material for ro- 
mance, and now Mr. Winston Churchill's Richard 
Carvel " has achieved a still higher triumph, and at 
once takes its place in the very front rank of our 
historical fiction. That the author of that amusing 
sketch, The Celebrity," had it in him to produce 
this full-bodied romance was, we must admit, a great 
surprise to us, for the gift of the light social satirist 
is one thing, and the gift of the successful delineator 
of a bygone period in all its political, social, and 
human aspects with the presentation of its acci- 
dents as well as of its essentials is quite another 
thing. Yet this latter thing Mr. Churchill has accom- 
plished, and in a way that betokens the infinite 
capacity for taking pains " which, although much of 
our slapdash criticism of modern slapdash work is apt 
to forget the fact, is still as characteristic of genius 
as it ever was. We should hesitate to designate as 
outright genius the power that shaped the present 
work, but it is, at all events, a power of character- 
ization and of description, a power of sympathetic 
insight and vivid dramatic presentation, such as only 
the best writers of fiction have at their command. 
When we say that this novel of Maryland in the 
days just before the Revolution is constantly remind- 
ing us of " The Virginians," it is for deeper reasons 
than tHe mere similarity of theme and situation. It 
is the equipment of the mind that has produced the 
book, it is the fulness of the life that is depicted. 
These things, even more than the convincing 
character-studies of John Paul Jones and Charles 
James Fox, and the forcible manner in which 
Richard Carvel is made the spokesman of patriotic 
American sentiment in a great historical moment, 
these are what distinguish the present novel, and 
set it upon a plane that hardly any other of our 
novelists has succeeded in occupying. 

There is probably no other period of English 
history that has occasioned so many romances as 
the period of the Civil War, and a writer must have 
considerable confidence in his powers to enter the 
lists with still another. In " Cromwell's Own," Mr. 
Arthur Paterson deals with the period that begins 
with the Long Parliament and ends with Marston 
' Moor. He has been greatly daring in his treatment 
of Cromwell, for the great general appears, not as 
an imposing figure whose shadow is from time to 
time cast over the scene, but rather as the central 
character of the romance, and overshadows the pri- 
vate figures with which the story is nominally con- 
cerned. This attempt at historical portraiture is 
measurably successful ; it gives us at once the grim- 
ness and the tenderness of Cromwell, it shows us 
the man who could be great enough to be inconsistent 
at critical moments, and allow the logic of the heart 
to oppose the dictates of the more formal logic of 
the intellect. Cromwell's household and family life, 
too, are portrayed with sympathetic insight. All 
this, however, does not prevent the story from being

a charming one considered merely as the romance 
of a young soldier and a Puritan maiden, and it is 
a satisfaction to know that the generous heroism of 
the one and the tender steadfastness of the other do 
not go in the end unrewarded, although many perils 
have to be surmounted before that consummation is 
reached. Mr. Paterson has told a thoroughly good 
story, which it is a pleasure to praise. 

" The Pedagogues " is a mere sketch, but it dis- 
plays unmistakable talent, besides having the ad- 
vantage of dealing with a subject almost unexplored 
by the novelist. The summer school is a compara- 
tively recent development of collegiate work, and, 
however it may try to make itself like the rest of 
the year, there remain certain features peculiar to 
the conditions of the summer season. This is the 
fact upon which Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier has 
seized, and with which he has successfully dealt. 
His characters are a young instructor of the languid 
and supercilious type, and a group of the students 
who take his summer course in composition and lit- 
erature. Among these students are two teachers 
from a country town in the West an ambitious 
girl who knows nothing of the finer graces of thought 
or of life, and an equally graceless young man who is 
besides a misunderstood genius. The girl has great 
self-confidence, but understands that there is much 
she may learn, and has considerable powers of adap- 
tation. The man is simply a bumptious clodhopper 
even if he does contribute turgid verses to his 
county newspaper. The two are engaged to be 
married, although we may hardly call them lovers. 
This is the situation set forth by Mr. Pier, with a fine 
sense of the humorous contrast between instructor 
and instructed. And the outcome is helpful on both 
sides. The roughness of the students becomes soft- 
ened, and the stiff superiority of the teacher melts 
into a more human sort of feeling through his con- 
tact with these students of a sort so different from 
any he has hitherto known. For there is a pathetic 
side to even the most ungainly of the seekers after 
culture who throng to the summer schools of the 
great universities ; and this is the thing that chiefly 
claims the attention upon continued acquaintance. 

" That Fortune," by Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, 
is in some sense a continuation of " A Little Jour- 
ney in the World " and " The Golden House," the 
three novels taken together forming a sort of trilogy 
of American society as it is focalized in New York. 
Carmen Henderson of " The Golden House," and 
Mavick, whom she married after the death of her 
first husband, reappear in the present novel, and the 
ill-gotten wealth acquired by Henderson, and to 
which the interest of all three books attaches, is in 
the end lost, to the chastening of all concerned. 
Fresh interest is supplied in the characters of two 
young people, who seem to embody the hope of our 
society in their reversion to simpler and saner ideals 
of life than those illustrated by the generation be- 
fore them a hope which Mr. Warner has sufficient 
optimism to entertain, in spite of what seems to us the 
steady and alarming disintegration of our social mor- 



ality. The new volume in this series is not quite on 
the level of its two predecessors, and all three suffer, 
from the artistic standpoint, in being the product of 
the critical rather than of the creative intellect. In 
other words, the gift of the essayist rather than that 
of the novelist is what they exhibit most conspicu- 
ously. But of their charm arid of their wholesome- 
ness there cannot be the least doubt, and we are 
inclined to consider them the most important con- 
tribution which their writer has made to American 
literature. 

" The Awakening," by Mrs. Chopin, is a story in 
which, with no other accessories than the trivial 
details of everyday life in and about New Orleans, 
there is worked out a poignant spiritual tragedy. 
The story is familiar enough. A woman is married 
without knowing what it is to love. Her husband 
is kind but commonplace. He cares overmuch for 
the conventions of life ; she, finding them a bar to 
the free development of her wayward personality, 
casts them off when " the awakening " comes to her, 
and discovers, too late, that she has cast off the 
anchor which alone could have saved her from ship- 
wreck. It is needless to say that the agency by 
which she becomes awakened is provided by another 
man. But he proves strong enough to resist temp- 
tation, while she is too weak to think of atoning for 
her fault. To her distraught thinking, self-destruction 
is the only way out, and the tragedy is accomplished 
in picturesque fashion. The story is a simple one, 
not without charm, but not altogether wholesome in 
its tendency. 

Miss Florence Wilkinson is a new writer, and her 
first book has many amateurish characteristics. It 
is called " The Lady of the Flag-Flowers," and is 
the story of a Canadian girl of mixed French and 
Indian blood. Her soul is awakened to the pos- 
sibilities of life in the great world by companion- 
ship with a young American student who comes to 
pass a summer among the habitants of the Lower 
Province. Later, she finds her way into this world 
that she has longed to know, and realizes some of 
the joys of life and more of its bitterness. But her 
wild spirit is not to be tamed, and so in the end it 
is broken, for that is the only alternative possible. 
The story is pathetically told, with much evidence 
of close observation of things French-Canadian, and 
with a sympathetic affection for the heroine that 
frail flower uprooted from the native soil in which 
alone it could hope to flourish. The chief fault of 
the book is that it has too many loose ends. Fresh 
starts are taken so frequently that the interest of 
the reader becomes unhinged, and he longs for a 
more straightforward manner of narration. 

Among recent volumes of short stories, that 
bearing the name of Mr. S. Levett Yeats is sure to 
arrest the attention of readers who remember " The 
Chevalier d'Auriac." It is called " The Heart of 
Denise," from the first of the nine pieces which it 
contains. This titular story is practically a novel- 
ette in dimensions, and has for its theme the period 
of latter sixteenth century history, and the struggle

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



between the Queen-Mother and the Be*arnais. It is 
a good story, with a valiant hero and a pert heroine, 
coming to a happy conclusion. Of the other stories, 
it remains to say that they are slight in comparison, 
and that several of them seem to poach upon Mr. 
Kipling's preserves, a fact to he explained by the 
statement that Mr. Yeats has seen much service in 
India, and thus writes from fulness of knowledge. 

The nine stories which Mr. R. V. Risley has called 
" Men's Tragedies " with such specific titles as 
"The Man Who Loved," "The Man Who Fell," 
and " The Man Who Cared " are all studies of an 
intense sort of character, and, in a sense, are all 
concerned with " men who cared " most earnestly 
for their ideals. These are mostly men of middle 
age, whose outward lives have been touched by 
failure, but who have held fast to some of the inner 
realities, and achieved a sort of spiritual triumph 
over adverse circumstances. There is distinct power 
in this book, although not here applied upon a scale 
sufficiently large to show what the writer has it in 
him to accomplish. We shall look forward with 
peculiar interest to the literary future which it 
seems safe to say is in store for him. 

" At a Winter's Fire " is not a thick volume, but 
it contains eleven stories, the work of Mr. Bernard 
Capes. The author seeks to be weird after the fan- 
tastic fashion of Foe, but his horrors are of a rather 
cheap sort, and he does not succeed in giving his 
imagined impossibilities the garb of verisimilitude. 
His method of narration, moreover, is frequently so 
tortuous as to make the stories difficult reading. 

Mr. Marriott Watson's six stories are described 
by the author as ' mostly winter tales," which would 
seem to imply that they, too, were best read " at a 
winter's fire." But, with one exception, they are 
not like the ghostly productions of Mr. Capes, being 
rather romantic fancies with a core of tragedy. The 
titular story alone, " The Heart of Miranda," has no 
tragical suggestion about it, but is simply a delicate 
and elusive study of the several approaches to a 
maiden's love, and not strictly a story at all. 

There is really nothing new to say about the new 
volume of short stories by Mr. Bret Harte. They 
are partly European and partly Calif ornian in theme, 
and they are better stories than almost anybody else 
can write nowadays. But it must be confessed that 
Mr. Harte's characters and situations are growing a 
little hackneyed, and these " Stories in Light and 
Shadow " are rather less interesting than most of 
their predecessors. 

The volume of " Short Rations " issued to the 
public by Mr. Williston Fish contains a series of 
sketches of life in the American army, all the way 
from West Point to the frontier post. Each sketch 
is a story, or the next thing to a story, and nearly 
all are concerned with the fortunes of one McVay, 
whose career is traced from his entrance into the 
Academy to the successful termination, many years 
later, of the romantic courtship which was there 
begun. Mr. Fish writes from knowledge, which is 
a strong claim to our attention, and with a crispnesa 



of literary manner, relieved by dry and effective 
humor, which is a still more cogent claim. He has 
given us a highly readable little volume, which we 
can recommend with a clear conscience. 

From Mr. Cable we hear too rarely of late, but 
when he does put forth a book, we are at least as- 
sured that his powers suffer no decline for lack of 
the old-time exercise. His " Strong Hearts," just 
now published, is a collection of three short stories 
illustrating once more the types of Southern char- 
acter that he knows so sympathetically and well. 
Stories of " heroic natures and poetic fates " he calls 
them, and insists that the three tales are but one in 
essence, meaning that the humblest and narrowest 
life may be turned into song by high purpose and 
strenuous endeavor, and that this is the all-important 
thing about his several heroes and heroines. In 
this book, the author seems to take us into a finer 
spiritual atmosphere than is his wont, and the eth- 
ical subtleties of the situations devised for us will 
hardly be penetrated by him who runs as he reads. 

The six stories called " Love's Dilemmas," by 
Mr. Robert Herrick, are in a sense prentice work, 
having been written from two to four years ago. 
They exhibit the promise of which The Gospel of 
Freedom " has been the subsequent fulfilment, and 
are marked by much fastidiousness of manner and 
subtlety of delineation. But Mr. Herrick has ad- 
vanced far beyond the stage represented by these 
slight performances, and it seems almost a pity to 
call attention to his early work. 

Mrs. Burton Harrison's volume of seven stories is 
characterized by lively invention, animated action, 
and an infusion of tender sentiment. The stories 
are mostly told of people who move in the most 
conventional and least humanly interesting section 
of American society, and it does no small credit to 
Mrs. Harrison's gift for entertainment to say that 
she keeps her readers interested. One reason is 
that she does not take her people too seriously, and 
knows how to treat "social aspirations" with deli- 
cate satire. " An Author's Reading " is a good 
illustration of this aspect of her work, and is as 
different as possible from the straightforward nar- 
rative of The Carcellini Emerald," which gives a 
title to the collection. 

The note of distinction (as the French would 
understand it) is rarely met with in the English or 
American short story, but it may certainly be found 
upon almost every page of the book by Mrs. Edith 
Wharton, with which this hurried review must close. 
Under the collective title "The Greater Inclina- 
tion," which belongs to no one of the stories in par- 
ticular, Mrs. Wharton has brought together eight 
pieces of delicate texture and artistic conception. 
Every one of them has the external shape and col- 
oring of the world in which we mingle day by day, 
and every one of them is at heart a poignant spirit- 
ual tragedy. The veils that are spread over most 
lives by wont and custom conceal the inner work- 
ings from the eyes of all but a few ; it is the privi- 
1 lege of the artist to penetrate their enveloping folds

and scan the bare soul within. The present writer 
does not neglect the outward aspect of the lives 
which she depicts, but, as the conception becomes 
developed by touches so deft that we never think of 
the conscious artistic endeavor, the subjective reality 
is in each case brought by insensible degrees into 
the field of vision, until the gaze is at last focussed 
upon that alone, and the full triumph of the work- 
manship bursts upon us. This may sound like ex- 
travagant praise, but no conventional commendation 
would be adequate for such a book. Between these 
stories and those of the ordinary entertaining sort 
there is a great gulf fixed there is all the differ- 
ence between the pure gold of art and its pinchbeck 
imitations. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



The best 
sea-writer 
since Dana. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

In his Introduction to Mr. Frank T. 
Bullen's " Idylls of the Sea " (Apple- 
ton) Mr. J. St. Loe Strachey rightly 
observes that " Mr. Bullen's work in literature re- 
quires no introduction." Mr. Strachey then pro- 
ceeds at some length to perform the ceremony he 
thinks superfluous. Mr. Kipling, it will be remem- 
bered, stood sponsor for Mr. Bullen's first book ; 
and as it was a first book, perhaps some little ad- 
vance trumpeting of this sort was admissible. But 
once was enough. " The Cruise of the Cachalot " 
established the reputation of Mr. Bullen's literary 
wares, and it was quite unnecessary to call in Mr. 
St. Loe Strachey or anybody else to vouch for their 
quality. We dislike these transparent devices ex- 
tremely, and Mr. Bullen's books are precisely of 
the sort to make their way perfectly well without 
them. Besides, Mr. Bullen's good wine is well 
known now, and needs no bush. He is the best sea- 
writer since Dana, and we earnestly hope that he 
will take to heart the lesson that Dana's book is a 
masterpiece mainly because it is simple, straight- 
forward, and true. Mr. Bullen is somewhat given 
to fine language and lurid melodramatic effects ; 
and wherever these tendencies discover themselves 
he becomes comparatively tame and rings a little 
false. What one wants from a writer of Mr. Bul- 
len's stamp is plain truth, and not flowers of speech. 
The " Cruise of the Cachalot " just missed being a 
masterpiece because Mr. Bullen would occasionally 
" spread himself " in a rhetorical way, and turn on 
the lime-lights. The forced episode of the death of 
Captain Slocum and " Goliah," for instance, is dis- 
tinctly bad and incredible nearly as bad and 
incredible as Mr. Bullen's Yankee dialect, which is 
easily hors concours in this way. Of Mr. Bullen's 
Yankee dialect there are, we regret to say, certain 
weird specimens in the little volume now before us. 
" Idylls of the Sea " is a budget of thirty brief sea- 
sketches, all replete with the lore of ocean, for, be 
it said, the author joins to the actual experiences of 
the " foremast-hand " a fair measure of scientific 



acquirement. But what makes Mr. Bullen a rather 
unique literary figure is the blending in him of the 
born writer and the common sailor. Pen or mar- 
linespike, it 's clearly all one to Mr. Bullen. In the 
" Idylls " he has given us a gallery of sea-pictures 
hard to beat in English literature. In fine, Mr. 
Bullen is facile princeps among sea-writers to-day; 
and we trust he will eschew in the future " fine 
writing," red-fire effects, Yankee dialect, and catch- 
penny puffery. 

It takes courage to write a book 

about Milton in view of the critical 
and biographical literature already 
existing, from Masson's ponderous " Life " to the 
admirable small books by Mark Pattison and Dr. 
Garnett. But the little book by Professor W. P. 
Trent, entitled " John Milton : A Short Study of 
His Life and Works " (Macmillan) finds its produc- 
tion amply justified by the generous enthusiasm and 
the fine critical sense which it displays. It is a 
panegyric, but a reasoned one ; and its obvious sin- 
cerity compels us to accept a judgment which can, 
when most severe, say nothing harsher than that 
some of Milton's controversial writing is " less edi- 
fying " than the rest of his work, and which de- 
clares of Milton at the outset that " he is the greatest 
artist, man of letters, and ideal patriot, that the 
world has ever known." The book is particularly 
justified by its solid treatment of the Latin poems, 
its comparative criticism of the elegiac verse, and 
its well-weighed comparisons of Milton with Dante 
and Shakespeare. Professor Trent is of those 
to whom the " Paradise Lost " means even more 
than does " The Divine Comedy," and who find it 
difficult to admit outright that even Shakespeare 
was the greater poet. We cannot go with him quite 
as far as this, but we are at one with him in pro- 
nouncing Milton " the great idealist of our Anglo- 
Saxon race," and in accepting the doctrine of the 
following fine passage : " It is this pure idealism of 
his that makes him by far the most important fig- 
ure, from a moral point of view, among all Anglo- 
Saxons ; for the genius of the race is practical, not 
ideal, compromise is everywhere regarded with 
favor as a working principle, and the main lesson 
we all have to learn is how to stand out unflinchingly 
for the true, the beautiful, and the good, regardless 
of merely present and practical considerations. . . . 
A due admiration for Milton's unflinching idealism, 
both of thought and action, will at least make it 
impossible for us to tolerate the charlatanism of 
compromise." 

The prefix " neo-" has still something 
of a v g ue : neo-Christians and neo- 
Celts have not yet lost all their 
original brightness. We esteem it, then, rather a 
compliment to call Mr. Hector C. Macpherson a 
neo-Smithian : he would return to the purity of the 
ideas of Adam Smith, unadulterated by the perver- 
sities of Malthus and Ricardo. The volume on Smith 
in the " Famous Scots " series (imported by Scrib- 



78 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



ner ) is rather more on Smith's thoughts than on 
his actions ; but this is as it should be. An emi- 
nent critic once remarked that people were silly 
always to ask, What are you doing? when the really 
important question is, What are you thinking? It 
does not appear that Adam Smith's life was more 
interesting than that of many another man of his 
day : save for his ideas, be was really what Mr. 
Macpherson says he seemed, " simply a sedate, 
absent-minded Scotsman, who lived a humdrum life 
in the region of dry and forbidding speculation." 
But " The Wealth of Nations " is a matter of inter- 
est, of how much interest, few lay readers will sus- 
pect until they read Mr. Macpherson's book. It is 
an admirable study, a thoroughly modern criticism. 
The author speaks of it as " the outcome of a desire 
to show the vitality of the principles of Smith's great 
work, and to trace their relations to the fruitful gen- 
eralizations associated with the Evolution theory." 
We should ourselves think the book quite as much 
the outcome of a desire to show the unsound founda- 
tion of certain political and commercial conditions 
of to-day, a pamphlet against ultra-imperialism and 
jingoism abroad and trades-unionism and socialism 
at home, a pamphlet meant for England, to be 
sure ; but we who have also some experience of the 
conditions against which the aid of Adam Smith is 
invoked will find our own ideas stimulated. Inci- 
dentally, we may note the author would rescue 
Political Economy from the verbal vice of Carlyle, 
by demonstrating that it is not " the dismal science."

^ a ^ me wnen Spain has come to 
fill a larger place than usual in our 
8p<miih fiction. thoughts, and when the evil passions 
excited by war have provided a hospitable harbor for 
every prejudice against that unhappy country, there 
is a peculiar value in such a book as " Contemporary 
Spain as Shown by her Novelists " (Truslove, Hanson , 
& Comba). Thanks to the numerous existing trans- 
lations, most readers know that, whatever her polit- 
ical shortcomings, Spain has produced a group of 
contemporary writers of fiction of which any coun- 
try might be proud. Those who have read the books 
of these novelists are aware, moreover, that they 
have documentary value of a very high sort, and 
that from all the hysterical journalism of the past 
year there could not be constructed so truthful a 
panorama of the Spanish society of to-day as may 
be viewed in the pages of the Spanish novelist*. It 
was, then, distinctly a happy thought on the part of 
Miss Mary W. Plnmmer to prepare the little book 
of selections now under consideration. Miss Plnm- 
mer has examined seventeen books by five writers 
Sefiora Bazan and Seftores Alarcdn, Galdtfa, Vald^s, 
and Valera and has extracted from them such 
passages as seem most illuminative of the present- 
day aspects of Spanish life. These passages are 
classified under the heads of local description, reli- 
gion, politics, manners and customs, and society, 
and make up a highly interesting and instructive 
volume. The books drawn upon have all been pub- 



lished during the past quarter-century, so that the 
picture they present is strictly modern. The Rev. 
Edward Everett Hale contributes a brief introduc- 
tion to this book, which we commend most heartily, 
both because of its interest as a study of contem- 
porary society, and because it may pave the way to a 
wider acquaintance with the remarkable literature 
upon which it is based. 



A helpful 
ttudy of the 
Renaittnncf. 



If Miss Lilian F. Field, in her " Intro- 
duction to the Study of the Renais- 
sance " (Scribner), had done nothing 
more than make it clear when and where the series 
of movements gathered into the meaning of that 
single word took place, she would deserve well of 
the student. But she does a great deal more. It 
is plain from the most cursory glance at her pages 
that not only was the Renaissance a series of phe- 
nomena of varied origin and scene, but that there 
were as many renaissances as there were arts, some- 
times several within the limits of a single nation ; 
while it is likely that the English-speaking peoples 
have not had their awakening in painting and sculp- 
ture to this day. This will serve to strike down a 
popular fancy, obtained from "study clubs" and 
the like, that the movement was a definite one, 
involving all the beaux arts and capable of precise 
and cogent treatment within narrow compass. Once 
it is made clear, as Miss Field makes it clear, that 
the word describes the entire transition from the 
middle ages to the modern fulness of spirit, and is 
a continuing and most highly diversified movement 
extending over the whole field of civilization, it will 
become capable of a popular treatment that is also 
scientific. The author is careful to accent the fact 
that her volume, compendious and well written as it 
is, must be taken as nothing more than a guide past 
the threshold of a very large topic ; and her readers 
are to be congratulated accordingly. 

M 88 Katharine Lyttelton's volume 
of Selections from the Thoughts of 
Joubert (Dodd) has a charming pre- 
face by Mrs. Humphry Ward, which deals mainly 
with the facts and relations of Joubert's personal 
life because, as Mrs. Ward says, - the reader who 
takes with him the memory of these personal inci- 
dents and affections will find, as he turns to the 
PensieS) that it interests them with a new charm, 
that it neutralizes that slight air of pedantry which 
perhaps such a book must always wear in the eyes 
of after-generations, and makes him docile and 
friendly toward the writer even when he is most fine- 
spun or most dogmatic." The determining points 
in the man's personal history were his marriage, and 
his two great friendships, the one with Pauline de 
Beaumont, the other with Madame de Timtimille ; 
and these Mrs. Ward treats with the acuteness, the 
delicacy, and the sympathetic imagination which we 
have learned to expect of her. Turning to Miss 
Lyttelton's work, we find an admirable selection, 
and translation in which the Gallic qualities of the

original are well preserved. The book is valuable, 
and will be distinctly welcome ; for there are many 
people perhaps a greater number than we think, 
even when we think most sensibly who, while 
unable to read the Pensees in the language in which 
they were written, are yet keenly alive to all such 
fastidiousness of expression and all such delicate 
wisdom as they contain. 

More interesting than most histories 
and far more true than most ro- 
mances, the translation made by 
Lady Mary Loyd of K. Waliszewski's " Mary- 
sienka " (Dodd) affords excellent reading, whether 
for diversion or instruction. Marie de la Grange 
d'Arquien, daughter of a French house, noble and 
decadent, was taken in the train of that Marie de 
Gonzague who became the wife of Ladislaw IV. of 
Poland. A mere child at the time of her expatria- 
tion, and a dependent child as well through her 
parents' poverty, she nevertheless rose to be the 
queen of Poland, having been married to the great 
Sobieski. Her elevation in that elective monarchy 
was due primarily to her husband's great military 
talents, but these as has happened so often in his- 
tory might very well have gone without the honor 
of the Polish crown had Marysienka been less of a 
courtier and politician. The author has been wise 
in weaving the facts into a rapid, easy narrative, 
the charm of which has been caught and retained by 
the translator. _

well acquainted both with the latest tendencies in 
science and philosophy and with mediaeval and an- 
cient mysticism ; he can quote Ribot and Tylor with 
the same intelligence as St. Augustine and St. 
Francis. What is the psychic essence and the real 
significance of mysticism, with its intuition of God, 
its symbolism and its ecstacy ? The author's answer 
is that mysticism as a true factor in humanity is 
purely subjective, a moral aspiration which lifts man 
to the heights of real freedom and love, and giving 
him peace in the sense of his being thus in the Ab- 
solute and the Absolute in him. " The mystical 
faculty is in reality the moral consciousness confided 
to its own sole initiative." But symbolism is only 
a language of the imagination, and denotes no more 
than the vision of the artist as to external realities. 
We commend this essay on the higher Pantheism as 
being eminently sane, suggestive, and penetrating.

mounting, and preserving insects of various kinds, 
and plans for cases and cabinets. Instructions are 
also given for field-work and the haunts and habits 
of insects are discussed. The book contains a brief 
account of the anatomy of insects, both in the adult 
and larval stages, and a discussion of their trans- 
formations. The greater part of the work is taken 
up with an extended treatment of the various orders, 
representatives being chosen from the more com- 
mon insects of the United States. Over 250 figures 
illustrate the text and obviate the necessity of the 
introduction of technical descriptions, thus permit- 
ting more attention to the life histories and habits. 
In this feature especially the work deserves high 
commendation. The system of classification used is 
up to date, and the information which the book con- 
tains is trustworthy and is told in simple language. 
The work is well done and admirably suited to its 
purpose, and the book will be a boon to school and 
public libraries as well as to students of the insect 

world. 

The author of the book called " The 
Gambling World " (Dodd), a well- 
known writer on sporting topics 
under the pen-name of " Rouge et Noir," has put 
forth a work which may be taken as encyclopaedic 
in its scope, classing the various sorts of specula- 
tion, in stock-markets and the like, along with the 
other games of chance, differentiating them only by 
showing that the risks which are well defined and 
ascertainable in ordinary gambling defy computa- 
tion " on 'Change." There is an explanation of that 
mysterious something-nothing commonly called 
" luck " which is exceedingly ingenious. Showing 
that the whole limit of chance as mathematically 
demonstrated is equal to a circle of wide circum- 
ference, he figures the impossibility of covering more 
than a minute arc of this within the limits of a sin- 
gle lifetime. Did one live long enough, he argues, 
matters would have equalized themselves and the 
mathematical law been justified ; as it is, the unfor- 
tunate segment of the circle may fall to one man's 
share, while his neighbor has the compensating por- 
tion. The entire book is filled with interesting expe- 
rience, and is quite free from that pseudo- classical 
knowledge which disfigures so many works of a 
similar nature.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



One of the clearest and best-arranged text books of 
rhetoric that have come to our notice is the " Composi- 
tion and Rhetoric for Schools " just published by Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co. It is the joint work of Messrs. 
Robert Herrick and Lindsay Todd Damon, of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. It provides preliminary chapters 
upon constructive work, and then proceeds to discuss 
usage, diction, and the rhetorical laws of sentences and 
paragraphs. Finally, the whole composition is dealt 
with, and the various forms of composition described. 
Rhetoric and composition go hand in hand throughout 
the work, and the exercises are chosen and grouped 
with a skill evidently born of experience in dealing with 
the difficulties of young students. 

A compact and attractive little book that should 
appeal to all intending visitors to the approaching Paris 
Exposition is " Lee's Guide to Gay Paree ' and Every- 
day French Conversation " (Laird & Lee). The author, 
Prof. Max Maury. has departed from the usual prosaic 
manner of the stereotyped guide-book, and writes in a 
vivacious and entertaining way that makes his little 
volume something more than a dry catalogue of facts. 
Much odd and out of the way information is given, and 
the text is supplemented by a number of useful maps 
and illustrations. The volume is of vest-pocket dimen- 
sions, and is serviceably and artistically bound in 
leather. 

The " Source-Book of American History " (Mac- 
millan) which Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart has " edited 
for schools and readers " is a volume that we have ex- 
amined with close attention and can commend with con- 
fidence. In about four hundred pages of text, it finds 
room for something like one hundred and fifty examples 
of the original material of our history, ranging all the 
way from the voyages of Columbus to the Spanish- 
American war. The selections are judiciously made, 
edited, and annotated; the introductory chapters for 
teachers are of the most helpful sort, and the book is 
sold at so low a price that no secondary school in which 
American history is taught can find a reasonable ex- 
cuse for not employing it as an adjunct to the regular 
manual. 

The " Lebensgeschichte " of Julian n Heinrich Jung, 
genaunt Stilling, has been edited by Mr. Sigmon M. 
Stern for Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. This is a pecu-

Goethe anniversary, and the book is a welcome addition 
to the texts available for school use. A " Second Year

the American Book Co., who also send us a small book 
of " French Sight Reading," prepared by Mr. L. C. 
Rogers. We may mention, too, the neat text of Mol-

fessor John M. Coulter, is published by the Messrs. 
Appleton in their series of " Twentieth Century Text- 
Books." This volume is devoted to the outlines of 
ecology, and will be followed by a companion work hav- 
ing morphology for its predominant subject. The text 
is planned for secondary schools, and is beautifully 
illustrated. 

M The Study of History in Schools," being the report 
made to the American Historical Association upon that 
subject by the Committee of Seven appointed in 1896, 
has just been published in a volume by the Macmillan 
Co. The importance of the work is sufficiently guar- 
anteed by the names attached to it. They include 
Professors A. C. McLaughliu, H. B. Adams, A. B. Hart, 
and H. Morse Stephens. 

The seventh volume to be published in the series of 
" Literatures of the World," as edited by Mr. Edmund 
Gosse, is " A History of Bohemian Literature," by 
Francis, Count Liitzow (Appleton). Since Bohemian 
writers, excepting Huss and Comenius, are all but abso- 
lutely unknown to English readers, the author of this 
volume has departed from the general plan of the series 
in giving a large amount of space to translated extracts. 
Psychology reduced to its lowest terms is what we 
find in An Outline Sketch of Psychology for Begin- 
ners," issued by the Open Court Publishing Co. That 
the work is sound in principle and modern in treatment 
may safely be inferred from the fact that it is written 
by Professor H. M. Stanley. If it be advisable (which 
we doubt) to attempt the instruction of children in 
psychology, this little manual of forty pages may be 
recommended.

SECONDARY ENGLISH TEXTS 



A Thoroughly Modern and Practical 
Text-Book in 

Composition and Rhetoric 
for Schools 

By ROBERT HERRICK. A.B., and LINDSAY TODD 

DAMON, A. B., both of the Department of 

English, The University of Chicago. 



This book embodies the most recently accepted 
method in English teaching in secondary schools. 
It has some distinctive features. 

INVENTIONAL WORK in shaping and ar- 
ranging thought receives the first attention. The 
student is aided in discovering and developing his 
powers of expression both by the skilful directions 
of the book and by the work of theme-writing. The 
criticism of themes is at first suggestive, not re- 
pressive and discouraging. Genuine interest and 
self-confidence will follow this method of work, 
and the student will rapidly mature the power of 
written expression. 

RHETORICAL THEORY as such is not pre- 
sented until the second part of the book, where it 
is taken up systematically. The study of good use 
in words, of diction, and of the rhetorical laws of 
the sentence and the paragraph, is followed by a 
general review of literary laws as applied to the 
whole composition. 

THE EXERCISES present many original and 
valuable features. They are suggestive, interest- 
ing, carefully chosen as to subject matter, and 
within the range of the average student's experi- 
ence and knowledge. 

" The arrangement and method please me exceed- 
ingly. The freshness of the illustrations, the order of 
subjects treated in Part I., the plan of the book as a 
whole, commend it especially." Professor W. . 
SlMONDS, Knox College, Galesburg, III. 

" The book commends itself to me as wholly admir- 
able in arrangement, method, and style of treatment. 
I particularly approve of the idea of the authors that 
the beginning work should stimulate invention in com- 
position, should be constructive, and that the minute 
criticism of details should come later. I shall put the 
book on the list of books recommended by the English 
Department to preparatory schools fitting for Welles- 
ley." S. C. HART, Auociate Professor of Rhetoric and 
Acting Head of Engluh Department, Wellesley College. 

Cloth, 476 pages, with full Index and Synopsis for 
Review. 

Copies will be mailed on receipt of the price, $ 1 .00.

ELEVENTH EDITION. SEVENTIETH THOUSAND. 

"Must be put among the best of recent American historical novel*" SPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN.

Published

By Winston Churchill. 



Cloth. 
Price, $1.50. 



" Mr. Churchill knows his London of the last cen- 
tury thoroughly, just a> he knows the province of Mary- 
land, where the spirit of revolution is slowly but surely 
developing. . . . Goldsmith dots not give a more vivid 
description of the debtor 1 ! jail or De Quincey of the piti- 
less heart of the metropolis than is found in the volume 
before us." Indianapolis Sentinel. 

"This novel is the most extensive piece of semi- 
historical fiction which has yet come from an American 
hand; and the skill with which the materials have 
been handled justifies the largeness of the plan." 
HAMILTON MABIE in the New York Times. 



" To say that it reminds us of ' The Virginians ' is to 
make an audacious comparison, but one which will nat- 
rally occur to many readers. That ' Richard Carvel ' 
is able to stand the comparison is a great feather in Mr. 
Churchill 1 * cap. ... In short, this is a strong and 
notable novel." The News and Courier (Charleston, 
S. C.)- 

" The charm of the book, which is very great, lies in 
the vividness of its pictures of the life of London and 
the colonies in those picturesque days. The characters 
are alive. One feels as if conning the pages of some old 
volume of the 'Spectator.'" Washington Times. 



BRILLIANT PICTURES OF COLONIAL LIFE. 



" The young writer, with his head full of the great 
romances, is tempted to emulate them all, to excel by 
piling up merits. Thus, the author of ' Richard Carvel,' 
in setting out to write a romance of the American Revo- 
lution, has boldly vied with the author of ' Kidnapped ' in 
the usurping uncle and the kidnapping of Richard by the 
slaver, with the author of 1 The Virginians ' in his pictures 
of the colonial gentry and the visit of the young colonial 
to the fashionable life of London, with the author of' Henry 
Esmond ' in the description of a reigning London beauty, 
with the romancers of the sea in the fight of John Paul 
Jones with the slaver and with the Serapis." Spring- 
Jield Republican. 

" ' Richard Carvel ' may in time become a classic of 
Maryland's romantic history." The Bookman. 



"The style achieves the direct, smart, frank, quaint 
vigor of the old times which so many have unsuccess- 
fully attempted." Boston Transcript. 

" Cooper, in ' The Spy,' was the first to show the wealth 
of interesting material in the Revolution, and his broadly 
blazed trail has been followed in recent years with great 
success by Dr. Weir Mitchell, Archdeacon Brady, and 
J. A. Altsheler. . . . To this small circle of writers of 
American historical romance must now be added Winston 
Churchill." San Francisco Chronicle. 

" Mr. Churchill has done that almost-impossible thing, 
in introducing historical personages into a work of fic- 
tion and vitalizing them so that they seem very flesh 
and blood, and not mere shadows." St. Louis Globe- 
Democrat. 



A PERMANENT ADDITION TO AMERICAN LITERATURE. 



M It is a further cause for congratulation that one 
more of our younger school of writers has been able to 
add another volume to the shelf, so vigorous, so delicate 
in fancy, so sentient with the qualities which make life 
worth living as ' Richard Carvel ' is. It is a great story." 
The Brooklyn Eagle. 

" It contains besides a score of characters which are 
worth remembering, and a few which one could not 
forget if one should try." Commercial Advertiser (New 
York). 

' The adoption of the autobiographic form, the good- 
natured diffuseness of the story, the antique nobility of 
the style, as well as the locality, remind the reader of 
'Henry Esmond.'" Picayune (New Orleans). 

"There is, indeed, an indescribable charm about all the 
author's sketches of London celebrities." Philadelphia 
Evening Telegraph. 



" It is a daring thing that Winston Churchill has done 
in his novel, ' Richard Carvel,' to tread the path made 
smooth by Thackeray, and, withal, to do it so well that 
one is forced to admire the resemblance. . . . The interest 
in the story never Hags, whether the scene is the Lon- 
don of Walpole's day, Maryland of Lord Baltimore's 
day, or on the sea. Dorothy Manners is nearly if not 
quite as lovable as Beatrice Esmond, for she has the 
saving grace of honesty, and as for Richard Carvel, he 
is quite as much a hero in London as was The Vir- 
ginian,' for he compelled respect, which Thackeray's 
America and London was not always able to do. This 
is the best- written novel we have seen for a long time, 
and really deserves all the success it attains." The 
Indianapolis News. 

" ' Richard Carvel ' is one of the most brilliant works 
of imagination of the decade." Philadelphia Press.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

n. 



Continuing from our last issue the summary, 
based upon reports written for the London 
" Athenaeum," of the literary productivity of 
the past year in Continental Europe, we now 
present the facts of chief importance for Hun- 
gary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Russia, and Spain. 
The writers who have furnished them are, re- 
spectively, Herr Leopold Katscher, Signer 
Guido Biagi, Herr C. Brinchmann, Professor 
Adam Belcikowski, Mr. Constantine Balmont, 
and Don Rafael Altamira. 

" Hitherto," says the writer upon Hungarian 



literary affairs, " I have never had to dwell at 
any length upon books on art, for the simple 
reason that our writers have been persistently 
neglectful of this branch of literature. Within 
the last twelvemonth their views seem to have 
changed, for the output of art books has per- 
haps been far greater than ever before, and is 
all the more striking as it includes the two 
most important publications of the whole season. 
First stands ' Italia,' an attractive externally 
and internally attractive volume of studies 
in Italian art by Mr. Albert Berzeviczy." Sec- 
ond comes the two folio volumes on "Hunga- 
rian Art Treasures," edited by Mr. E. de 
Radisics. Three volumes are yet to come, and 
Mr. Jokai introduces the publication. History 
comes next on the list, and the writer notes 
progress in several important many-volumed 
undertakings, besides announcing the " Great 
Illustrated History of the World," a collabo- 
rative publication in twelve volumes, under the 
editorship of Mr. Henrik Marczali. Fiction 
embraces the " Story of a Girl," by Mr. F. 
Herczeg ; " The Silver Goal," by Mr. Brody ; 
" Uneven Wednesdays," by Mr. Szomahazy ; 
and " Autumn Hunting," by Mr. Arpad Berc- 
zik. The latter, who is also a successful writer 
of comedies, " takes his subjects from common- 
place life ; this offers quite enough matter for 
banter. He is a serene, smiling, quiet observer, 
who takes Horace's advice, tidendo dicere 
verum, and he invariably writes in the most 
amiable style." He has also produced this 
year a comedy, " Himfy's Songs," in his best 
style. Other dramatic works are two by Mr. 
Jokai, and two by Mr. Herczeg. Allied with 
this subject are Mr. Joseph Bayer's " History 
of Hungarian Dramatic Literature " and Mr. 
Sziiry's " Dramatic Impressions," dealing 
chiefly with Shakespeare. Mr. Albert Popipi's 
" Byron and Shelley " shows, at least, that the 
interest of Hungarians in English literature is 
not confined to our greatest poet. 

The year's literary harvest in Italy, we are 
told at the outset, has been neither prosperous 
nor abundant. " Hailstorms and drought have 
ruined the crops and impeded the productive- 
ness of the soil, restricting the yield almost 
entirely to learned works or occasional writ- 
ings." The riots of a year ago, and the various 
centenaries of the past twelvemonth have been 



88 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



partly responsible for this result. " We have 
commemorated Amerigo Vespucci and Paolo 
Toscanelli, Savonarola, Leopardi, Moretto of 
Brescia, Bernini, and these celebrations have 
involved a shower of speeches, biographical 
writings, critical studies and occasional mono- 
graphs which now take the place of those poems 
under which, in former times, the printing- 
presses used to groan, substituting for the 
Arcadia of poetry another boredom, the Ar- 
cadia of erudition." 

" The Italo- American centenary dedicated to Tosca- 
nelli and Vespucci baa produced one good volume, the 
' Life of Amerigo Vespucci,' written originally by Signer 
A. M. fiandini, published under the superintendence of 
the committee for the Florence celebrations. The Sa- 
vonarola centenary, besides the annual flowering of roses 
in the Piazza della Signoria (on the day of the historic 
bonfire), has produced the excellent selection from the 
works of Savonarola published by Professor Villari and 
Signer E. Casanova, to which volume the publishers 
hare added the ' Cronaca ' of Filipepi, the brother of 
Alessandro Botticelli, a new and important document 
of the Reformer's times. The Leopardi centenary has 
yielded a still better harvest. Apart from the speeches 
I should mention some publications of prime importance 
for the study of the poet of Recanati: in the first place, 
Signer Giosue Carducci's volume, ' Form and Spirit in the 
Poems of Giacomo Leopardi,' and in the next, Signor 
Federioo di Roberto's psychological study entitled ' Leo- 
pardi,' which is in reality the history of a soul the soul 
of the unhappy poet. We have also the long-expected 
' Pensieri Inediti di G. Leopardi,' edited by a government 
commission from MSS. formerly in the possession of 
Antonio Ranieri, claimed by the government on grounds 
of public utility. Three volumes of these ' Pensieri ' 
have already seen the light, and seven more are to fol- 
low. This work, hitherto unknown, reveals the whole 
development of the poet's mind ; it forms, as it were, a 
forest of thoughts and reflections which are the raw 
material of the work afterwards matured and polished 
by Leopardi in such artistic perfection. 

Just now in Italy, lectures and public readings 
take the place of books for many people. 

" A most intimate friend of mine affirms that the lec- 
ture is the bicycle of literature: it has created a sportive 
literature, a literature of diversion, easily digested, and 
often limited in aim. Time was when Italy was the 
country of academies; a century ago they were counted 
by hundreds. Now it threatens to become the classic 
land of lectures. ... At Florence, for the last ten 
years, there has been going on a series of lectures on 
' La Vita Italiana ' at various periods, beginning with 
the least known of medieval times. The most illus- 
trious Italian men of letters, and some foreigners, includ- 
ing Symonds and Vernon Lee,' have contributed to this 
work, which, carrying out a design prepared beforehand 
by the promoting committee, constitutes a complete 
course on the history of Italian culture, and which, pub- 
lished in volume form, is now in the hands of all of pu- 
pils in secondary schools as well as of private students." 

Dante has by no means been neglected in these 
lectures, and the following statement is ex- 
tremely interesting : 



"The Florentine committee of the Italian Dante 
Society has renewed, in the historic ball of Or San 
Mil-hell- now dedicated to Dante the reading and 
explanation of the ' Divina Commedia,' which began in 
the poet's own city by Boccaccio in 1373, and ceased 
fifteen years ago, with the death of Father G. B. Giu- 
liani. Every Thursday from November to June, a canto 
of the poem is read and explained every time by a 
fresh commentator. The first canto, after the expla- 
nation, was recited by Signor Tommaso Salvini. The 
best-known Dante scholars, such as Signori Pio Rajna, 
Guido Mazzoni, Corrado Ricci, have recently inaugu- 
rated this new Dante professorship. In next November 
and the following months the readings will be given 
by Signori Carducci, Del Luugo, Panzacchi, Casini, and, 
in short, the most illustrious men, who count it an honour 
to render this homage to the poet and the Baptist's city." 

Critical literature is chiefly represented by 
studies in Dante from the hands of Signor Pio 
Rajna and Signor Nidoro del Lungo, by Pro- 
fessor Lisio's edition of the " Principe," and 
by Signor Carducci's edition of the " Rime " 
of Petrarch. The latter is " a work gathering 
up the results of forty years' study of Petrarch, 
completed by the poet with admirable perse- 
verance a work indeed above the average, 
both in its method and in its abundant stores 
of learning, sifted and discussed with critical 
and artistic taste. No one will henceforth care 
to read Petrarch except under the guidance of 
Carducci." Classical studies have been numer- 
ous, and the interest taken in them at the pres- 
ent time is well illustrated by the following : 

" Very curious is a bi-monthly published at Rome 
(bis in mense prodit) under the title of < Vox Urbis,' 
written entirely in Latin. The editor prefers prose 
writings (soluta oratione); those in verse (numeris fusa) 
are condemned to the waste-paper basket, which here 
appears as cistellula. This shows that the love of Latin 
is not dead among us, and this is confirmed by another 
circumstance, still more grotesque: the 'Ri vista d'ltalia' 
publishes an elegant Latin ode by the octogenarian 
Senator G. B. Giorgini under the title ' In Bicyclettam.' " 

In miscellaneous literature there is a second 
volume of General della Rocca's autobiography, 
and a volume by Signor de Amicis, entitled 
" La Carrozza di Tutti," which studies " the 
physiology of city life as it can be observed 
from a tramcar." The best verse of the year 
is found in volumes by Signori Angelo Orvieto 
and Alfredo Baccelli. Novels and short stories 
of any value are almost non-existent. As for 
the stage, all other interests are overshadowed 
by that taken in Signor d'Annunzio's " La 
Giooonda." In this play the author " has 
striven to bring back poetry where a grotesque 
realism has prevailed too long. A noble at- 
tempt, but the stage is the realm of the probable, 
and often not to say always poetry departs 
from truth and appears improbable and absurd." 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

Herr Bjornson's powerful drama, " Paul 
Lange and Tora Parsberg " has been the great 
event of the twelvemonth in Norway. 

" Admirably adapted for scenic representation though 
it be, it has as yet not been produced on any stage in 
Norway, though it has been played several times in 
Germany. The obvious reason of this is, of course, that, 
through the inevitable publicity attending all social 
events in our small community, too abnormal a sensation 
was called forth by the fact that the principal character 
of the play is a but thinly veiled impersonation of a well- 
known politician, who some years ago committed suicide 
during a political crisis intensified, and all but brought 
to a point, by the author of this drama." 

The writer cannot restrain his enthusiasm for 
this remarkable work, saying further of the 
hero that " to this highly finished study of char- 
acter the author has brought all his knowledge 
of human nature and eager sympathy," and of 
the heroine that she " may be considered the 
finest womanly character in modern literature." 
In another way the year is important for dra- 
matic art since it has just witnessed the open- 
ing of the new National Theatre of Christiania. 
This will be " the special home of Norwegian 
plays," and has already acquired the right of 
production for the new piece by Dr. Ibsen, 
promised for the coming autumn. The only 
other books that we need mention are " Byens 
Fffidre," by Herr E. Kraemmer; "Fugl Fonix," 
by Herr G. Scott ; " Hugormen," by Herr 
H. E. Kinck ; Afkom," by Fru A. Skram ; 
" Trondere," by Herr P. Egge ; " Vestlands- 
viser," by Herr V. Krag ; " Digte," by Herr 
T. Andersen ; " Norske Digte og Digtere," by 
Herr J. Bing ; and Herr Kjaer's revised and 
critical edition of the comedies of Holberg. 

Polish literature has little to report of inter- 
est to the outside world. " Mr. Sienkiewicz 
has not yet completed his great historical ro- 
mance ' The Crusaders,' nor Madame E. Or- 
zeszko her ' Argonauts,' a picture of moral 
depravity and the most recent times. Many, 
also, of our elder writers have been completely 
silent, so that new names as, of course, is 
the natural way of things gain constantly 
more space in our literature." Works of fic- 
tion that have actually appeared include " At 
the Edge of the Forest," by Mr. W. Sieros- 
zewski ; *' The Promised Land," by Mr. W. 
Reymont ; " The Swindlers," by Mr. A. Grus- 
zecki ; " In the Old Mansion," by the same 
author ; " The Labors of Sisyphus," by Mr. 
J. Lych ; " The Distaff," by Mr. M. Rodzie- 
wicz ; " The Young Lady," by Miss Emma 
Jelenska; and "Brothers and Elective Affin- 
ity," by Mrs. Z. Kowerska. 



" The only representative of the historical novel in 
the past twelvemonth has been the new work of Mr. A. 
Krechowiecki, ' For the Throne,' in which he brings be- 
fore the reader in many effective scenes and with great 
skill, the bloodless struggle which broke out in Poland 
after the abdication of John Casimir. The best of the 
many characters introduced is undoubtedly that of the 
great Elector of Brandenburg, who took a leading part 
in the intrigues." 

Of lyric poets, two are mentioned, Mr. J. Kas- 
prowicz, with " The Wild Rose Shrub," and 
Mr. L. Rydel, with a volume of poems. " There 
are three monographs to record on Mickiewicz : 
a brilliant essay by the poetess Mrs. Konop- 
nicka ; ' Adam Mickiewicz : a Psychological 
Study of the Poet,' by Mr. A. Belcikowski ; 
and ' The Esthetic of Mickiewicz,' by Mr. P. 
Chmielowski, a book full of profound and orig- 
inal views." 

Russia is still a country in which literature 
seeks, to an unusual extent, periodical and 
other ephemeral outlets. 

" With us the colourless monthly magazine is in full 
vigour; it is accompanied by the empty newspaper. The 
main contents of these publications are feeble stories of 
life among the people, or, even worse, those that deal 
with the purposeless life of the so-called ' intelligent 
class.' To these we must add melancholy essays on 
economic questions and scientific compilations weak 
critical studies which continually repeat thoughts uttered 
years ago by abler journalists. The ethical element in 
our romances is at the same time the lever of Archi- 
medes and the heel of Achilles in Russian literature. 
The everlasting confusion of two entirely different 
spheres of literary production gives the world at one 
time such splendid productions as ' Crime and Punish- 
ment,' by Dostoievski, and the ' Anna Karenina ' of 
Tolstoi, and at another lands Russian literature in the 
hopeless quagmire in which it is now found." 

Count Tolstoy's " The Resurrection " is, of 
course, the chief work of the year. The follow- 
ing is a part of the criticism made upon it : 

" It is impossible to utter a decisive opinion on this 
novel, because it is not yet finished, but, judging by the 
chapters which have already been published, we can see 
the literary methods of the contemporary Tolstoi. Hav- 
ing planned a whole series of astonishing artistic com- 
binations, he himself destroys them, by underscoring for 
greater emphasis what is obvious; he furnishes them 
with a commentary, and converts his novel into a com- 
monplace sermon on truths which no one disputes. He 
lowers his genius to the attitude of a schoolmaster with 
a ferule in his hand." 

A complete edition of the works of Mr. K. K. 
Sluchevski is a noteworthy publication. This 
poet, largely ignored until recently, " occupies 
quite a peculiar position : he imitates no one, 
he speaks his own language, which is full of 
that expressiveness which we find in a harmo- 
niously constructed mind which has the pro- 
fundity of an inviolate sincerity. If among

Russian poets there is one who has never lied, 
has not gone in quest of phrases, but has 
been true to himself," that poet is the one 
under consideration. In poems of " a dark 
and terrible beauty" he suggests Baudelaire 
and M. Richepin. An important work of his- 
torical scholarship is the just completed four- 
volume biography of Alexander I., by Mr. 
N. K. Shilder. 

" This is no ordinary historical work, but rather an 
historico- psychological monograph. The author has 
concentrated all his attention on the personality of the 
Tsar. He submits it to a minute analysis, full of sci- 
entific and artistic merit. It is a character composed 
of contradictions: at one time full of heroism, decision, 
and manliness; at another, timid and yielding like a 
reed in the wind. Such a person is fitted to become 
the hero of a poem." 

The three- volume history of Russian literature, 
from the earliest times to Lemonosov, by Mr. 
A. Pypin, has also been completed. 

" The end of the best month of this year I mean 
the last week of May was made memorable for 
Russia by a national festival, the centenary of the birth 
of Pushkin. Pushkin is our glory, our pride, our sun. 
His songs, full of native beauty for us, were the dawn 
of Russian poetry. In the last hours of the century 
that has passed, when the horizon of the intellectual 
life of Russia is enveloped in mist, it is consoling to see 
that on the edges of the dark clouds the beams of that 
sun still shine which illumined us in the morning hour. 
These beams promise us a new dawn, new happiness, 
new youth." 

Spanish literature remains chiefly noteworthy 
for its voluminous production of books in the 
historical field, including much local history, 
and the publication of many unprinted docu- 
ments. These books have little interest out- 
side of the country of their origin, and we pass 
them without special mention, noting, however, 
that subjects " relating to our former colonies 
in America and Oceania " have been in special 
favor. " Belles-lettres are positively in a state 
of decay." Among novels, there are two " Epi- 
sodios Nacionales," by SeHor Galdos ; " La 
Alegria del Capitan Ribot," by SeSor Valdes ; 
" Cuentos Sacroprofanos," by Sefiora Bazan ; 
44 Carmela Rediviva," by SeSor Matteu ; and 
the forthcoming * 4 Morsamor " of Sefior Valera. 
Of poems and plays, none seem particularly 
important, and we are even told that "Eche- 
garay has not succeeded in pleasing the public 
with any of his recent efforts." But it is inter- 
esting to note that there have been successful 
performances of such translated plays as the 
44 Persse " and the 4t Prometheus" of ^Eschylus, 
the "Iphigenie auf Tauris" of Goethe, and 
the " Hamlet " and 44 Twelfth Night " (Cuento 
de Amor) of Shakespeare. 



POET, ARTIST-MANUFACTURER, AND 
SOCIALIST.* 

In writing the Life of William Morris 
Mr. Mackail has bad an unusually difficult 
biographical task. Morris's career was many- 
stranded, and his unique and somewhat eccen- 
tric personality was one to tax the art and the 
discretion of the delineator. It is therefore 
particularly gratifying to find how well and 
satisfy ingly, with what patience, candor, and 
constructive skill, Mr. Mackail has done his 
work. The spirit of truth, as well as of sym- 
pathy, has presided over his labors ; and it 
would scarcely be possible to tell the story of 
William Morris's life and work more effec- 
tively and attractively than it is told in these 
two beautiful volumes. Mr. Mackail has per- 
haps laid more stress upon and devoted more 
space to the doings and dream ings and literary 
and esthetic philanderings of Morris and his 
set at Oxford than the American reader will 
think necessary. It may well be that the En- 
glish undergraduate is in general a more ma- 
ture and intellectually considerable creature 
than his American counterpart ; but at all 
events we are not accustomed here to take very 
seriously the performances of youths at col- 
lege, and their views on the deeper problems 
of life, art, and society. But Mr. Mackail ap- 
pears to take Morris and his young friends of 
the " Brotherhood " quite as seriously as they 
took themselves, which is saying a good deal. 

We have spoken of Morris's career as "many- 
stranded." Threefold would perhaps be the 
better term, for in regarding his pursuits or 
activities as a whole, his early and quickly 
abandoned essays as painter and as architect 
proper may be left out of view as incidental 
and abortive. It was as poet, artist-manufac- 
turer, and Socialist that William Morris made 
his impression upon his time and is likely to 
live for a while in the world's remembrance. 
His poetry began at Oxford, and went on con- 
currently with his manufacturing during the 
greater part of his career. It may be added 
that evidence is not lacking that Morris re- 
garded the manufacturing, the production of 
sound and artistic furniture, chintzes, wall- 
paper, carpets, and so on, as the worthier and 
more dignified of his two pursuits. " Poetry," 
he once impatiently observed, 44 is tommy rot ";

and, in so far as poetry takes the form of a 
mere shell of verbal filigree and sham mediae- 
valism, we may largely agree with him. His 
Socialistic apostolate began relatively late, with 
the formation of the Democratic Federation in 
1883, and had lapsed into a sort of passive 
Socialism, a philosophic repose on the bosom 
of the stream of tendency, toward 1890, when 
reflection induced by experience of his col- 
leagues in the various organizations, and of the 
masses who were to be " elevated " (largely 
in spite of themselves, as he came to see) 
forced him to admit that the movement toward 
higher things must be a gradual one of educa- 
tion, of evolution, of normal and secular na- 
tional change, and not of active and immediate 
revolution and the overthrow of the existing 
social fabric through the use of the newly ac- 
quired lever of popular suffrage. Socialism, 
in fine, might be expected to come, in one form 
or another, when England had grown up to it, 
not before ; and, like the present system, could 
only prevail by virtue of being a reflection of 
actual English needs and capacities, in a word, of 
average English character. Morris, whose So- 
cialism was temperamental or emotional rather 
than a fruit of scientific study and conviction, 
though at one time he applied himself manfully 
to 'the doctrinal abstrusities of the authorities, 
was keenly touched by the hard lot of the poor. 
But, it is curious to note, the hard lot of the 
poor meant to his mind mainly the being cut 
off, to so great a degree, from the enjoyment 
of and the production of works of art ! The 
wage-worker he characteristically conceived as 
a pathetic figure knocking in vain for admis- 
sion at the gates of the Palace of Art, which 
were closed against him by the ruthless hand 
of the " profit-grinder." The Birmingham 
operative, the " navvy," Devonshire " Giles," 
and even London " 'Arry " himself, were sup- 
posed to be yearning for that degree of grace- 
ful leisure which would enable them to enter 
freely into the joys of painted windows, medi- 
aeval brasses, illuminated folios, and (last but 
not least) the pictures of Kossetti and Co.! Of 
course the cold fact was, and Morris came to 
realize it, that the " profit-grinder's " victim, in 
nine cases out of ten, did not care a rush for 
the Palace of Art, as compared with the beer- 
shop and the race-track. He even showed an 
ungrateful inclination to take a comic, not to 
say blackguardly, view of Morris himself and 
his performances, to turn his outdoor meetings 
into occasions for starting an enjoyable row 
with the police, and to vaguely identify his 



preachings in behalf of the art -hungering 
masses with the corybantic exercises of the Sal- 
vation Army. Morris used to recount in a 
serio-comic way instances of the unpleasant 
notoriety which his well-meant efforts gained 
for him. Jeers and insults at the hands of the 
very class he championed were hard to bear. 
Even the Hammersmith green-grocer's boy, 
he wrote sadly, took to bawling " Socialist ! 
Morris ! " in no flattering tones after him in 
the streets ; while passing " 'Arrys," fertile in 
sarcasm, once added cuttingly to the usual epi- 
thet, " Shakespeare, yah ! " In short, Morris, 
taking to heart the lesson that England's 
" lower class brutalized " was scarcely ripe for 
his collectivistic millenium, with its superadded 
aesthetic refinements, and admitting the fact 
(palpable everywhere outside of Utopia) that 
the advent of a higher social system presup- 
poses the advent of a higher type of men, lat- 
terly eschewed militant Socialism, pinned his 
faith to education rather than agitation, and 
returned to his true province of creative art 
and artistic handicraft. His growing modera- 
tion and opportunism naturally offended his 
colleagues of the League ; and he soon found 
himself deposed from the control of its organ, 
the " Commonweal," and replaced by one 
Frank Kitz, an extremist of the ordinary type, 
who presently got the sheet and its managers 
into the hands of the police, who found it high 
time to repress its attacks on the principle of 
law and order and its constructive incitements 
to murder. The article that was the immediate 
cause of the ruin of the paper (which was already 
on the brink of ruin through lack of funds) was 
angrily characterized by Morris as " idiotic." 
Thus, while abandoning his early dream of 
regenerating England overnight and producing 
roses from her thorns and figs from her thistles 
through the spell of some legislative incantation 
or miracle of constitution-making, Morris by no 
means abandoned his faith in Socialism as an 
ideal of future approximation, as a goal toward 
which society is gradually tending. " Some 
approach to it," he said, " is sure to be tried." 
Morris's inborn medievalism, let us note in 
passing, his habit of looking backward for 
canons and models of excellence, was oddly 
blended with a vein of thoroughgoing eight- 
eenth-century perfecibilitarianism, of faith in, 
the continuity and theoretically boundless pos- 
sibilities of human progress. With Rousseau 
he turned for the Golden Age to the past ; 
with Condorcet he discerned it in the future. 
There is perhaps an inconsistency too (and

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



men of genius like Morris must not be grudged 
their inconsistencies) in his supreme exaltation 
of an art that began and flourished amid the 
wide inequalities, the rigid class distinctions, 
of feudal society, and his doctrine that it is the 
kindred, though far less stringent, inequalities 
and distinctions of modern society that stunt 
and stifle art. Art cannot flourish to-day be- 
cause of the survival of conditions under which 
it flourished so magnificently five centuries ago ! 
It is not to be inferred from the fact of 
Morris's abandonment of militant and aggres- 
sive Socialism that he thenceforth ingloriously 
sank into a comfortable, not to say an indolent, 
reliance on the virtues of laisser-fairc. The 
good work of sowing the seed of Socialism, he 
strenuously urged, must go on ; but the sower 
must arm his soul with patience, must be pre- 
pared to wait long for the harvest, nay, must 
be content to scatter the seed of a harvest which 
a generation yet unborn will reap. Education 
must be the watchword. In his final manifesto 
to the League, he says : 

" . . . I say for us to make Socialiit* is the business 
at present, and at present I do not think we can have 
any other useful business. . . . When we have enough 
people of that way of thinking, they will find out what 
action is necessary for putting their principles in prac- 
tice. Therefore, I say, make Socialists. We Socialists 
can do nothing else that is useful." 

This calm and reasoned counsel drew forth 
a volley of protest and abuse from the extrem- 
ists of the sect, who were already babbling of 
dynamite and open war upon society, and who 
had now awakened in Scotland Yard a languid 
interest in their proceedings, through their 
sage deliberations as to the ways and means for 
barricading the streets of London. But Morris, 
says Mr. Mackail, " had already left the 
League, and the moment he did so it began to 
crumble away like sand," as in fact it must, 
since the withdrawal of Morris meant the with- 
drawal of its main source of pecuniary sup- 
plies. Morris, let us say, was not one of that 
order of Socialists who have been described as 
yearning to do good with other people's money. 
He was a liberal supporter, financially, of the 
various reforming organizations. But he was 
not, nevertheless, by any means what the world 
is used to call a liberal, an open-handed man. 
This statement brings us to a searching criti- 
cism of his character made by Mr. Mackail, 
which serves not only to help us understand 
Morris, but to exemplify Mr. Mac-kail's com- 
mend ably fair and judicial attitude as a biog- 
rapher. Morris, holds Mr. Mackail, was inter- 
ested in things much more than in people, in 



classes much more than in men. The thing 
done, whatever it might be, was what he cared 
about in the work of his contemporaries and 
friends no less than in that of other ages and 
countries. So too in the common concerns of 
life he was strangely incurious of individuals 

a quality of mind which took, on the one 
hand, the form of absolute indifference to gos- 
sip, and a capacity of working with the most dis- 
agreeable and jarring colleagues, so long as they 
were useful to the work in hand, and, on the other, 
of an almost equally marked inconsiderate- 
ness." For sympathy in distress, for aid in 
trouble, it was not to him one would have gone : 

" The lot of the poor, as a class, when he thought of 
it, had always lain heavily on his spirit. . . . But the 
sufferings of individuals often only moved him to a cer- 
tain impatience. Many years before, Kossetti, in one 
of those flashes of hard insight that made him so ter- 
rible a friend, had said of him, ' Did you ever notice 
that Top (Morris's nickname) never gives a penny to a 
beggar ? ' Inconsiderate and even unscrupulous as 
Rossetti was himself in some of the larger affairs of 
life, this particular instinct of generosity was one which 
never failed him. For the individual in distress were 
it a friend in difficulties, or some unknown poor woman 
on the streets he was always ready to empty his own 
pockets, and plunge deeply into those of his friends. 
Morris's virtues were of a completely different type. 
. . . That habit of magnificence, which to the Greek 
mind was the crown of virtues, was Kossetti's most re- 
markable quality. In the nature of Morris it had no 
place. ' I am bourgeois, you know, and therefore with- 
out the point of honor,' be had written many years 
before to Madox Brown in a moment of real self- 
appreciation; and his virtues were therefore those of 
the bourgeois class industrious, honest, fair-minded 
up to their lights, but unexpansive and unsympathetic 

so far as the touch of genius did not transform him 
into something quite unique and incalculable." 

A unique figure in English life, in more 
ways than one, Morris certainly was ; and he 
paid the penalty of the offence of being un- 
like other people." As a pronounced (though 
entirely unaffected) social non-conformist he 
met with the usual obloquy and misconstruc- 
tion. Morris did not care three straws for 
Mrs. Grundy, and was indeed seemingly un- 
aware of her existence ; and Mrs. Grundy 
fumed accordingly. He did what he liked and 
wore what he liked at London, just as he had 
read what he liked and worn " purple trousers " 
at Oxford. British philistinism disapproved of 
him ; Podsnap shook his head at him ; 'Arry," 
as we have seen, jeered at him. " I have had," 
he said, " a life of insults and suoking of 
brains." English university education is mainly 
bent on the formation and conservation of a 
type, rather than on the detection and foster- 
ing of special individual gifts and capacities. 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



There is a certain academic mould into which 
each young gentleman is assiduously pressed 
during the period of his academic career ; and 
while the process is in average cases followed 
by desirable and agreeable results, it must 
prove a largely abortive, and may very con- 
ceivably prove a cramping and deadening pro- 
cess, in cases where, as in that of Morris, it 
happens to run counter to the promptings and 
to block the line of natural expansion of genius. 
Morris derived little profit from the prescribed 
tasks at Oxford ; and, says Mr. Mackail : 

" ... to the end of his life the educational system 
and the intellectual life of modern Oxford were mat- 
ters as to which he remained bitterly prejudiced, and 
the name of ' Don ' was used by him as a synonym for 
all that was narrow, ignorant, and pedantic." 

But an " Oxford man " he nominally was ; 
and, therefore, as at once a man of means and 
University education who deliberately kept a 
shop, a poet who chose to ply a handicraft, to 
weave, dye, and carve, not as a gentleman ama- 
teur, but under the usual conditions of handi- 
craftsman, he was to the average mind a figure 
so unique as to be scarcely comprehensible. 
Sir E. Beckett once sarcastically called him 
the " poet upholsterer "; but Morris, who had 
no taint of the snob in his soul, and to whom 
the feelings of the snob were as unintelligible 
as his own feelings were to people like Sir E. 
Beckett, calmly accepted the epithet as " a 
harmless statement of fact," and seemed on 
the whole to plume himself more on his " up- 
holstering " than his poetry. That he should do 
so is hardly surprising when we reflect that the 
efforts of William Morris to replace in En- 
gland the house hideous by the house beautiful 
resulted in a salutary and perhaps a saving 
revolution in her art-manufactures. 

It may be interesting to know what Mr. 
Mackail has to say of the debate over the be- 
stowal of the laureateship in 1892. The claims 
of Morris, as based on the amount and quality of 
his poetic work, were of course such as could not 
be ignored. But his political views would have 
assorted strangely with his occupancy of the 
office, and it would have been difficult for those 
who knew him even slightly to seriously figure 
him as the official eulogist of the existing order 
and celebrant of its triumphs. Says the author : 
"As regards his personal views on the matter, Mr. 
Gladstone, who had then just become for the fourth 
time Prime Minister, kept his own counsel: and it is 
matter of common knowledge that no recommendation 
was ever made by him to the Queen, and that the office 
remained unfilled for three years during his Govern- 
ment and the administration which succeeded it. But 



after this lapse of time it may not be indiscreet to say 
that Morris was sounded by a member of the Cabinet, 
with Mr. Gladstone's approval, to ascertain whether he 
would accept the office in the event of its being offered 
to him. His answer was unhesitating. He was frankly 
pleased that it had been thought of, and did not under- 
value the implied honor: but it was one which his prin- 
ciples and tastes alike made it impossible for him to 
accept. The matter went no further. In private con- 
versation Morris always held that the proper function 
of a Poet Laureate was that of a ceremonial writer of 
official verse, and that in this particular case the Mar- 
quis of Lome was the person pointed out for the office 
should the office be thought one worth keeping up under 
modern conditions by position and acquirements." 

Not the least interesting part of Mr. Mac- 
kail's book is the story of the inception and 
growth of the unique manufacturing business 
of Morris and Co. Characterizing Morris as 
a manufacturer, Mr. Mackail goes on to say : 

" He carried on his business as a manufacturer not 
because he wished to make money, but because he 
wished to make the things he manufactured. The art 
of commerce as it consists in buying material and labor 
cheaply, and forcing the largest possible sale of the 
product, was one for which he had little aptitude and 
less liking. In every manual art which he touched, he 
was a skilled expert: in the art of money-making he 
remained to the last an amateur. Throughout he re- 
garded material with the eye of an artist, and labor with 
the eye of a fellow-laborer. He never grudged or hag- 
gled over the price of anything which he thought really 
excellent of its kind and really desirable for him to 
have; he would dye with kermes instead of cochineal if 
he could gain an almost imperceptible richness of tone by 
doing so: he would condemn piece after piece of his man- 
ufacture that did not satisfy his own severe judgment." 

Mrs. Kitchie thus describes a visit to the 
shop in its early and rudimentary days : 

" I perfectly remember going with Val Prinsep one 
foggy morning to some square, miles away; we came 
into an empty ground-floor room, and Val Prinsep 
called Topsy ! ' very loud, and someone came from 
above with hair on end and in a nonchalant way began 
to show one or two of bis curious, and to my uninitiated 
soul, bewildering treasures. I think Morris said the 
glasses would stand firm when he put them on the table. 
I bought two tumblers of which Val Prinsep praised 
the shape. He and Val wrapped them up in paper, and 
I came away very much amused and interested, with a 
general impression of sympathetic shyness and shadows 
and dim green glass." 

Mr. Mackail has given us a model biog- 
raphy, and the publishers have issued it in a 
form that the fastidious taste of its hero would 
have approved. There are several excellent por- 
traits of Morris, and Mr. New's drawings are 
capital in themselves and have a certain sugges- 
tion of special adaptation in point of style or 
treatment to their setting and occasion. A few 
plates illustrative of Morris's designing might 
have formed a desirable addition to the pictorial 
attractions of the work. E. G. J.

THK ENDLK88 EPIC QUKSTION.* 



The interesting and important work upon the 
epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, by the Italian 
scholar Comparetti, appeared in Italian in 
1891 and in German in 1892. It now pre- 
sents itself to us in a smooth and comely En- 
glish dress, and Mr. Andrew Lang makes the 
introduction. A complete English translation 
of the poem itself, by an American scholar, 
Mr. John Martin Crawford, was published at 
New York in 1888. 

The English translation of Comparetti vio- 
lates literary ethics by appearing without an 
index, though the table of contents is somewhat 
full. I shall therefore give some page-refer- 
ences. Mr. Lang's own book, " Homer and 
the Epic," which contains a short chapter about 
the Kalevala, has no index and the briefest pos- 
sible table of contents. When will scholars take 
up the bookmaker's burden, and see to it that 
their volumes are published in a usable form ? 

The Kalevala has usually been looked upon 
" as an ancient national epos, orally preserved 
by tradition, and collected from the mouths of 
the people, principally by Lonnrot" (p. 10). In 
point of fact it was in many ways constructed 
by Lonnrot, not simply collected. The idea of 
combining the folk-songs of the Finns which 
treat the same or related subjects was first sug- 
gested to this scholar by the popular singers 
themselves, who feel free to combine several 
songs into a larger whole. Lonnrot finally 
went far beyond this, and attempted to weave 
into a great unified poem all that was most 
interesting and significant in the entire mass 
of Finnish folk-poetry. To do this he made 
alterations in the ballads somewhat freely, 
though in most cases he either followed some 
one of the various versions of the particular 
song, or at least made changes that could easily 
be paralleled from the actual folk-poetry. The 
unity of the Kalevala thus obtained, however, 
is something very imperfect ; sometimes there 
is very little attempt to unify the various stories 
(p. 144) ; at times fundamental inconsistencies 
have been allowed to remain (pp. 148, 847^*.) ; 
and what unity exists is often external rather 
than intrinsic. For example, the runes (songs)

concerning Lemminkainen are brought into a 
superficial connection with those about Wain- 
amoinen and Ilmarinen by making him join 
those two heroes in the expedition for the recov- 
ery of the Sampo. " A third companion often 
actually occurs in the songs of the people, but 
this is never Lemminkainen," except in a single 
fragment (pp. 182, 135 n.). Chapter III. of 
Part I., " The Composition of the Kalevala," 
tells in detail just how Lbnnrot built up the 
great poem from the materials furnished him 
in the folk-songs. This is perhaps the most 
interesting portion of the book. We learn here 
how it happens that the story of the making of 
the first harp from the bones of the great pike 
and of the exquisite singing of Wainamoinen 
(Runes 40, 41) is followed later by the loss 
of this harp (close of Rune 42) and the making 
of a second from the sacred birch-tree (Rune 
44). In reality, no Finnish singer knows of 
two harps. The loss of the first instrument 
was a pure invention of Lonnrot, in order that 
he might thereby weave into his poem another 
charming version of the origin of the harp. 
The changing of the tears of Wainamoinen 
into sea-pearls (Rune 41) is a striking incident 
which seems to have originated wholly with 
Lonnrot (p. 156 ; see also p. 257 concerning 
the making of the Sampo). 

The magic song, or charm, is the funda- 
mental product of Finnish folk-poetry (pp. 24, 
187, 232) ; the interesting belief that one who 
recites correctly the account of the origin of 
any evil force takes away thereby its power 
for harm (pp. 27, 229) explains why these 
magic songs are narrative in form, and sug- 
gests in a strange way the wise philosophy of 
Bacon. The Finns are perhaps the only people 
who have produced poetry of a high degree 
of excellence while still believing in the uni- 
versal efficacy of magic (p. 24). The aesthetic 
power of song seems to be a later conception 
(p. 821). The hero in this poetry is the wiz- 
ard, the magician (pp. 172, 185, 230). The 
deeds of separate hero-wizards make up the 
poem ; " no peoples or social masses appear in 
collective action or in conflict" (pp. 22 /'., 
329). The thoroughly non-historical character 
of the Kalevala is a constant surprise to the 
student whose ideas have been formed by read- 
ing the other great folk-epics (pp. 23, 60, 246, 
329). 

" The Finns of Russia and of the Russian church are 
still quite illiterate and in a state of primitive simplic- 
ity; among them the tradition of the songs has remained 
singularly fresh. For the genuine traditional rune is in 



1899.]

its essence the poetry of the illiterate, the poetry of 
nature " (p. 19). "The northern region in which the 
ancient Russian songs most abound and are most un- 
changed is the same in which the poetical tradition of 
the Finns also is best preserved : the government of Arch- 
angel, and Olonetz from Lake Onega to Lake Ladoga " 
(p. 311). 

Mr. Lang's main interest in the Kalevala 
and in the work of Comparetti is because of 
the light thrown by them upon the broader 
Homeric question, better called the epic ques- 
tion, the problem concerning the mode of 
origin of the world's great national epics. In- 
deed, this larger question was probably the 
especial stimulus which led Comparetti him- 
self to study the epic of the Finns. 

The reason why this problem is an endless 
one is not far to seek. Since Wolf in 1795 
advocated the view that the Iliad was put to- 
gether from separate songs, two tendencies have 
been clearly developed in the theorizings con- 
cerning the origin of folk-epics. One tendency 
accents the element of folk-poetry, popular 
poetry, as the fundamental fact. Since most 
popular poetry is narrative, and this exists 
almost entirely in the form of separate ballads, 
this view makes much of the individual folk- 
songs, and makes little of the grave difficulties 
which confront one who tries to explain how 
any particular epic was put together from these 
elements. These difficulties are somewhat 
mitigated by the theory that the Iliad, for ex- 
ample, existed at one time as a simpler though 
complete poem, a primary Iliad, to which suc- 
cessive additions have been made. We must 
remember, also, that in folk-poetry itself we 
find ballads combined into larger compositions. 
The English " Gest of Robin Hood " is ad- 
mitted to be a composite of different ballads. 
Compound ballads are well-known to the Finns. 
Comparetti gives one which corresponds to five 
different runes of the Kalevala and parts of 
three others (pp. 158^.). It is somewhat mis- 
leading, therefore, to suggest that no " song 
existing independently ever figures in a large 
poem " (viii.). 

The second tendency in explaining the origin 
of popular epics is to accent the element of 
plan and the organic unity of the great mass of 
material, and either to overlook the precedent 
folk-songs or at least to minimize their import- 
ance. The origin of a popular epic, however, 
cannot possibly be explained without the pres- 
ence in some measure of both factors, the 
creative but unconscious folk-spirit and the con- 
scious master-poet. Inasmuch as folk-poetry 
cannot flourish except in a society uncultured 



and free from self-consciousness, incapable of 
observing and reporting the phenomena of its 
own mental life, both the general problem and 
that with reference to each particular epic be- 
come impossible of exact solution. The import- 
ance of the Kalevala in this line of inquiry is 
very great, since it is " the only example we 
have of a national poem actually resulting from 
minor songs ; these songs being not discovera- 
ble in it according to some preconceived idea by 
means of inductive analysis, but known as really 
existing independently of the large composi- 
tion " (ix.). Lonnrot thought himself to be a 
Finnish Homer, composing the epic of his race 
from their stores of song. Comparetti points 
out that Lonnrot, though a folk-poet at heart, 
was also a scholar, filled with modern theoriz- 
ings concerning the making of popular epics 
(p. 340) ; and " the processes of such a man 
are no argument for early Greece" (Lang, xvi.). 
Moreover, although Lbnnrot alters and trans- 
poses with great freedom, and sometimes inserts 
original passages, the Kalevala comes far short 
of possessing a unity like that of the Iliad or 
the Odyssey. Though charming in all its parts, 
the Finnish epic, when considered as a whole, 
remains in many respects a piece of patchwork. 

There can be no doubt, I think, that Mr. 
Lang underestimates the importance of the folk 
element in the Homeric poems. He says, using 
in part the language of Comparetti : 

" In my opinion the maker of the Iliad did just what 
was done by the maker of The Lay of the Last Minstrel. 
Out of his knowledge of facts or fancies, as existing in 
lays and traditions, he fashioned a long poem with be- 
ginning, middle, and end, with organic unity, harmony, 
proportion of parts coordinated among themselves, and 
converging towards a final catastrophe ' " (xxi.). 

But the two cases are far from parallel. The 
conception of a body of songs concerning the 
Trojan War, which give an accurate version of 
the events, is distinctly assumed in the Odyssey 
itself (Bk., i. 11. 350 j., viii. 74J., 489J., 500 
S) ; without insisting that this conception is 
correct for the lifetime of an actual Odysseus, it 
seems clear that the nature of the popular liter- 
ature in existence at the time when the Odys- 
sey was composed made this conception appear 
natural and unquestionable. 

Comparetti declares : " A long poem, created 
by the people, does not exist, cannot exist ; 
epic popular songs, such as could be put together 
into a true poem, have never been seen and are 
not likely to be seen among any people " 
(p. 352). This seems extreme in view of what 
a Russian scholar named Radloff has told us 
about the popular poetry of a Turkish tribe,

the Kara-Kirghis.* These people dwell among 
the mountains of Central Asia, in the general 
neighborhood of Lake Issyk-kul and the city of 
Kashgar, near the westernmost border of the 
Chinese Empire. The poetry of this tribe, 
according to liadloff, is still " in a certain ori- 
ginal period which is best called the genuinely 
epic period, that same period in which the 
Greeks were found when their epio songs of 
the Trojan war were not yet written, but lived 
in the form of genuine folk-poetry in the mouths 
of the people." The national feeling of the 
Kara-Kirghis " has united separate epic songs 
into one undivided whole . . . the different 
traditions and stories, historical recollections, 
tales, and ballads, as though in obedience to 
some force of attraction combine about an epic 
centre and in all their dismemberment appear 
parts of a comprehensive general picture." 
" Only a people which has not reached indi- 
vidual culture," says Radloff, " can create bards 
from its midst and develop a period of contem- 
poraneous epic. With the spread of culture " 
come " rhapsodists who do not compose them- 
selves but sing songs borrowed from others." 
Radloff cites the following passage from Stein- 
thai : f " Up to 1832 no one knew of a whole 
Finnish epic. . . . No one had knowledge of 
the unity, and yet ... it was existent in the 
songs themselves." Radloff comments on this 
as follows : " From this I venture only to con- 
clude that among the Finns in the year 1832 
the period of contemporaneous epic (as it now 
exists among the Kara-Kirghis) was already 
past. In the epic period the consciousness of 
the unity of the epic is still living in each por-

It must be admitted that so far as Radloff 
enters into details concerning the poetry of the 
Kara-Kirghis, the epic unity which binds to- 
gether the various songs of the tribe seems to 
be somewhat loose and vague ; but it seems 
clear that a real unity is felt, and that Com- 
paretti has gone too far in the assertion cited 
above. The following comprehensive state-

tuated and brought to light" (p. 339). 

It is a striking fact that the most important 
poems in English which have some right to be 
regarded as epics of art approximate closely to 
the folk-epic in some essential respects. " Sig- 
urd the Volsnng," by William Morris, is a fas- 
cinating re-telling in a continuous poem of the 
various Eddie poems concerning Sigurd and of 
the prose Volsunga Saga. The poet makes 
no attempt to remove all the difficulties and 
inconsistencies which he found in his sources. 
The story which Tennyson chose for his theme 
in " The Idylls of the King " took its rise in 
remote Celtic tradition, and, becoming later a 
literary tradition, had attracted other stories to 
itself and had been fashioned and re-fashioned 
in countless ways centuries before Tennyson. 
The general story of Milton's " Paradise Lost " 
was first told in a form destined to dominate 
subsequent writers, by Bishop Avitus of Vienne, 
about 500 A.D., in his Latin epic poem, "De 
Spiritalis Historiae Gestis." Professor Marsh 
of Harvard University tells us that this poem 
was itself the outcome of a precedent poetic 
tradition, and that it was especially poetical 
and powerful " largely because Avitus made 
use freely and skilfully of what his predeces- 
sors had done."* Yet Avitus wrote nearly 
1200 years before Milton. Some of the more 
important English versions of this story be- 
tween Avitus and Milton are to be found in 
the poems formerly attributed to Caedmon, in 
the Cursor Mundi^ and in the cycles of mys- 
tery plays. The last editor of " Paradise Lost," 
Mr. Moody, in his admirable " Cambridge 
Milton," discusses only the different Renais- 
sance poems which treat of the Fall of Man 
and which may have directly influenced Milton. 
If we bear in mind the entire tradition, the 
following words of Mr. Moody become so much 
more expressive : In a " restricted but still 
significant sense, Paradise Lost is a ' natural 
epic,' with a law of growth like that of Beo- 
wulf* or the Iliad." 

We can say in general that the two concep- 
tions, that of an epic with a story wholly 
invented by its author, so far as invention is 
possible, and that of one made up of folk-songs 
unaltered but arranged in the most effective 
order, are the polar opposites of each other. 
It is probably impossible that a large, impres- 
sive, and unified poem, one which we could 
properly term an epic, a masterpiece of grand 
narrative, could approximate very closely to

either of these poles. Among all the epics 
accessible to the general reader, the Kalevala 
comes nearest to one of these extremes, that 
of a simple arrangement of folk-songs. 

The first volume of the work of Abercromby 
is mainly occupied in discussing the geograph- 
ical distribution, the craniology, and the pre- 
historic civilization of the Finns. The last 
chapter of this volume treats of the beliefs of the 
West Finns as exhibited in their magic songs ; 
while the second volume is almost entirely occu- 
pied by a translation of a very large portion of 
the great collection of magic songs published by 
Lonnrot in 1880. The lover of the Kalevala 
can here study in English some of the original 
materials from which that epic was made. 

Political happenings also call our attention 
at present to Finland. Since Russia wrested 
this district from Sweden in 1809, the inhabi- 
tants have enjoyed more freedom and a better 
government than any other portion of the 
empire. But now their cherished rights are 
being taken away, and the Finns are appeal- 
ing to the civilized world for sympathy and 
moral support. Would that the recent acts of 
our own republic had not taken away from us 
the right and the power to speak out effectively 
in behalf of freedom and self- government for the 

distressed Finns ! TT m

STUDIES ix COLONIAL, ARCHITECTURE.* 



The portfolio of plates issued under the title 
of " The Georgian Period " includes a collec- 
tion of measured drawings, details, picturesque 
sketches, and photographic reproductions of 
Colonial work in Massachusetts, New York, 
New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and 
South Carolina ; and represents the work of 
such well-known architectural artists as Messrs. 
Frank W. Wallis, David A. Gregg, Claude 
Fayette Bragdon, E. Eldon Deane, Pierre G. 
Gulbranson, George C. Tolmau, and others. 

This work is especially pleasing and valuable 
to the historian and to the lover of Colonial 
associations. If taken in the spirit of one of 
Fiske's histories, and studied in connection 
with it, its delight and charm would be great. 
As a setting for incidents in Colonial history, 
it is not only consistent, but necessary, in order 
that a complete idea of the lives of our fore- 
fathers may be obtained. 

* THE GEORGIAN PERIOD. Being Measured Drawings of 
Colonial Work. Boston : American Architect and Building 
News Company. 



To the architect, this volume is also useful 
if viewed in a reminiscent way. He must dis- 
criminate between that which is straightfor- 
ward and unaffected and that which is mere 
adaptation. The architect who looks beyond 
many of the Colonial porches to the simple and 
dignified walls, with their well-proportioned 
openings, will find much value in these plates. 
Our meaning is illustrated by the very first 
plate in the collection, in which the portion 
which it is meant to illustrate (the porch) is the 
least valuable part ; while the background (the 
house) is charming in its straightforwardness 
and simplicity. The perspective sketches of 
the Royal Mansion, by Mr. Deane, give a Col- 
onial atmosphere which we moderns would do 
well to emulate, much more than do the meas- 
ured drawings of details of the same building 
which follow. Architects should not go to 
such sources for their classic detail. If they 
are unable to relate their detail to the time and 
the conditions under which they work, and feel 
that they must go to precedent, it is much safer 
for them to go to that period which was the 
guiding one for our Colonial ancestors. The 
value of this work is therefore suggestive rather 
than literal. We should not use it as an ency- 
clopaedia of definite forms and proportions. We 
must use it rather as an encouragement and 
inspiration along the lines of simple straight- 
forward design. To put it more tersely, the 
measured drawings are very apt to do our 
thinking for us, whereas we should compel our 
architects to make an independent problem of 
every commission that is given them. 

The Colonial church is a delightful building 
to enter. When there, we step back into the 
last century. There is danger, however, if our 
architects accept this model, that they will 
ignore the increasing democratic tendencies and 
the changes in ecclesiastical forms which have 
come upon us since those churches were built. 
The architect who would do the parallel thing, 
emulating in the best way the examples left by 
the architects of these churches, would realize 
the institutional character which is to govern 
our churches in the future, and would give his 
building the same relation to that institutional 
and democratic tendency that those Colonial 
churches have to the Colonial times with which 
they most charmingly correspond. 

Through this delightful series, many Colo- 
nial mantels are shown. They are, most of 
them, faithful applications of classic or renais- 
sance architecture as designed for stone ; and 
as such they fail. If one turns to Plate 26,

and notes the plain mantel in the living-room 
of the Fairbanks house, he will find a spirit of 
directness, a consistent use of material, with 
simplicity and harmonious proportions ; and 
that sheet alone would justify the publication 
of this work. Combined as it is with the pho- 
tographic reproduction of the exterior, it makes 
one of the most valuable portions of the volume. 

The plate giving the Jonathan Childs house 
in Rochester shows a detail of the porch which 
is very faithfully worked out, and may be use- 
ful if one wishes to build for archaeological or 
museum purposes. It is distinctly stone archi- 
tecture, it implies a temple, and it is not con- 
sistent when executed in wood or used as a 
dwelling ; and it is to this problem of consist- 
ency that we would especially bring the atten- 
tion of our architects. 

It has often been said that art is most free 
when its media are most restricted. Compar- 
ison between Plate No. 1, Part II., on one 
hand, and the iron work shown on Plates 27 
'and 30, Part II., will illustrate this point. 
Our early Colonial builders had planes which 
enabled them to copy stone forms in wood ; and 
the result was a debased art. But at the same 
time they did not have such power over iron. 
The railing referred to, which is in the New 
York City Hall, is distinctly an iron railing. 
It is the work of a man with hammer and 
anvil ; and being compelled by the nature of 
the material to work along more or less orig- 
inal lines, the designer, either consciously or 
unconsciously, depended upon beautiful line, 
good proportion, proper spacing, proper bal- 
ance between straight lines and curved lines, 
and thus he produced a beautiful thing. He gave 
another example of the power of independent 
thought combined with artistic perception. 

In Part No. III., Plate 6, the sketches by 
Mr. Gregg give us a delightful historic sug- 
gestion. Plate 30 gives us a charming glimpse 
of Providence life. Plate 16 is an illustration 
of what we would have our architects avoid. 
It is a mantel designed in stone and executed 
in wood, and covered with draperies from some 
antique funeral. There is a certain refinement, 
which we must admit, in the character of the 
moulding, but we should compel our architects 
to work with equal refinement along progres- 
sive lines. To be consistent they should derive 
the motives for their geometrical and conven- 
tional ornament from the plants, animals, or 
things of any nature that we love and with 
which we surround ourselves.

CONGRESSIONAL REGULATION OF 
COMMERCE.* 

A treatise upon one clause of the Constitu- 
tion of the United States is an innovation, but 
a wholesome and serviceable one. The clause 
selected in this instance is the one by which 
the people of America sought to remedy that 
evil in their former system of government 
which, of all others, they seemed to feel most 
deeply. It was a consultation between certain 
States as to the best means of securing a gen- 
eral commercial system, which proved the ini- 
tial step toward the Constitutional Convention 
of 1787. To provide remedial measures in this 
respect, it was suggested that a convention be 
assembled for the purpose of amending the 
Articles of Union ; and that assembly, when 
convened, prepared the frame of constitution 
which the people afterward adopted. The pro- 
vision committing to Congress the power to 
regulate foreign and domestic commerce did 
not for several decades excite friction sufficient 
to call for the interposition of the courts. By 
reason of this, the lines of demarkation between 
the proper province of State legislation upon 
commercial subjects, and the field within which 
power was given to Congress, were for a long 
time not clearly seen. The States, legislating 
over subjects incidental and germane to com- 
merce, often passed laws which in fact assumed 
to regulate commerce. But in time it became 
necessary for the Federal courts to interfere, 
and to expound the " Commerce Clause." In 
1823, the legislation of South Carolina against 
the introduction of free negroes into that State 
was, by Mr. Justice Johnson in the United 
States Circuit Court, declared to be an infringe- 
ment upon the exclusive power of Congress to 
regulate commerce. In 1824, the Supreme 
Court of the United States declared void the 
legislation of New York which gave to Robert 
Fulton and his associates the monopoly of nav- 
igating public waters with the lately perfected 
steamboats. Since then, the occasions have 
been numerous for similar interpositions by 
the courts between the action of State Legis- 
latures and the constitutional powers of Con- 
gress. Only one other clause of the Federal 
Constitution, and that the one which forbids 
State laws impairing the obligation of con- 
tracts, has called for a larger number of judi- 
cial deliverances.

THE DIAL

a treatise on the Commerce Clause of the 
Constitution which will be instructive, not to 
lawyers alone, but to all who have observed the 
wonderful development of commercial spirit 
and enterprise in the United States. As im- 
portant as are the Police power and the Taxing 
power of the States, in our Federal system, and 
as efficiently as these powers are sustained by 
the Federal courts, they are required to yield 
precedence and are subordinated to the Com- 
merce power of the central government when- 
ever they are found to be in conflict with it. 
The theories by which these sometimes warring 
powers are adjusted to harmonious action will 
interest all students of our national institutions. 
The various subjects in respect to which the 
Congressional power is exercised namely, the 
control of navigable waters, port regulations, 
carriers, rates, and taxation are treated by 
the authors in separate chapters, and as to each 
the course of jurisprudence is traced in its de- 
velopment. The question whether the consti- 
tutional grant of power to Congress is ipso 
facto exclusive of State action, when not exer- 
cised by Congress, has been variously answered 
by the Federal courts. The vacillations of 
judicial opinion on this feature of the subject 
are traced instructively in this treatise. 

The history of the development of judicial 
opinion concerning the Commerce Clause, as 
here presented, is disappointing in one respect. 
The authors advocate the untenable theory that 
the United States did not become a Nation 
until made so by the results of the Civil War. 
Politicians and partisans often find this a con- 
venient postulate. But the jurisprudence of 
our country confutes the proposition, and the 
constitutional arguments which rest upon it 
prove to be misleading. Our authors assume 
that " the issue of the Civil War finally estab- 
lished, on a new basis, the relations between 
the states and the federal government," and 
add: 

" We pass from the old regime to the new, not by 
the slow processes of judicial construction, but at a 
single step, as the national sovereignty which the war 
established as a fact is given place in the constitutional 
law of the nation by the decisions of the Court." 

From these premises the conclusion is easily 
drawn that the post-bellum decisions of the 
Supreme Court under the Commerce Clause, 
in respect to national and State action on com- 
mercial subjects, have worked a great change 
" in the construction of the Federal powers." 
To enforce this theory the authors say, 
" In Crandall v. Nevada (1867) may be found the 



substance of what was accomplished by that great 
struggle. All the triumph of the armies of the Union 
breathes in its stately judgment that ' the people of 
these United States constitute one nation.' " 

But in fact, so far as the Federal jurisprudence 
is concerned, that doctrine is one of its earliest 
principles. In the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 
the Supreme Court in 1793 delivered its stately 
judgment, answering affirmatively the question, 
" Do the people of the United States form a 
Nation ? " This principle has continuously 
been adhered to by the courts, and it formed 
the basis of the early decisions in respect to the 
Commerce Clause in 1823 and 1824, above 
mentioned. In the light of constitutional juris- 
prudence, the United States has always been a 
Nation, and the war worked no change in this 
respect. What it did accomplish was to silence 
the murmurs of discontent against the settled 
law of the land. How misleading is the theory 
adopted in this treatise may be seen in the 
attempt to prove it, as to the Commerce Clause 
and the law applicable thereto, by the case of 
Crandall v. Nevada. The Supreme Court in 
that case declined to apply the Commerce 
Clause, but based its decision upon the consti- 
tutional rights which appertain to United States 
citizenship. To illustrate its views, the court 
in this Nevada case quoted with approval from 
an opinion of Chief Justice Taney, given in 
1848, sustaining the constitutional rights of 
citizens of the United States, and declaring 
that " For all the great purposes for which the 
Federal government was formed, we are one 
people, with one common country."

PEACE, WAR, AND HISTORY.*

United States of Europe " with the statement that 
" In the year 1898 two strange things happened." 
These, he explains at some length, were the call to 
arms and conquest by the United States of America, 
and the call to a parliament of peace by the Czar. 
The two are placed in forcible contrast. He says :

more than a hundred years had made as its proudest 
boast its haughty indifference to the temptation of 
territorial conquest, suddenly abjured its secular 
creed, and concluded a war upon which it had en- 
tered with every protestation of absolute disinter- 
estedness by annexations so sweeping as to invest 
the United States with all that was left of the her- 
itage of imperial Spain." Against this he sets a 
paragraph of equal length describing the military 
autocracy which now heads the world in an overt 
expression of the love for peace. 

Mr. William A. Johnston, who is an editorial 
writer for the New York " Herald," begins his " His- 
tory up to Date " with the statement that " This 
book is a concise account of the birth of a new era 
in the United States. It is a record of the dying 
moments of the Monroe Doctrine, the spirit that 
for more than one hundred years inspired the civic 
body born in the Revolution of the American Col- 
onies of Great Britain near the end of the last cen- 
tury." It is hardly necessary to recall that the 
United States has recently annexed Hawaii in the 
face of a majority of its inhabitants ; that it has 
had in the Philippines a larger army than King 
George ever imported into its own territories during 
the Revolution, engaged in teaching the people there 
that governments do not derive their just rights 
from the consent of the governed ; that, with the 
Declaration of Independence and the Monroe Doc- 
trine, the injunctions of Washington's Farewell 
Address and Lincoln's Gettysburg Speech have 
been disregarded, the fear of standing armies wiped 
away, and the solemn pledges of the Nation thrown 
aside, with all the teachings of its former history 
and best tradition. 

As a consequence, Mr. Stead observed the rep- 
resentatives of the United States at the Hague in 
the interests of peace when their country is actu- 
ally engaged in a war against the independence of 
a people armed by itself, and proposing a method 
of international arbitration in the face of its own 
flat and unexplained refusal to arbitrate its differ- 
ences with Spain when that unhappy nation pleaded 
for it. And the American who remains at home 
finds other things not less contradictory and strange, 
all of them indicating that the methods of Europe, 
which made us great only because for a century and 
a quarter of national life they were carefully avoided, 
are now to make us greater by our adopting them 
in minute detail. And over all the wrench given 
our institutions is spread a pall of silence, the re- 
fusal on the part of the Government of the United 
States to make known the truth in respect of its 
military or other operations in its newly conquered 
territories, and the refusal of the dominant political 
party to permit any expression of dissent from a 
policy which Russia itself sees that the world has 
fairly outgrown. 

These considerations make the majority of these 
books dismal and unsatisfactory reading. Mr. 
Stead's work is the result of an extended journey 



through continental Europe, and while it speaks 
with no uncertain voice for peace, it finds in the 
prospect of a united Europe the best means of 
meeting the new menace to the world's harmony in 
the form of the Great Republic militant. Through- 
out the capitals of the great powers he found an 
increasing feeling that the burden of war was grow- 
ing too heavy to be borne, armaments over there 
causing an expenditure almost as great as the bribes 
offered to the American electorate in the form of 
pensions in the case of several of the nations 
involved. His argument is carried to its logical 
conclusion by Mr. Farrer's New Leviathan," in 
which is shown the curious fact that socialism and 
other means for the elimination of national bound- 
aries have their rise in the very standing armies 
created for the insurance of national feeling. The 
work of Messrs. McCabe and Darien, " Can We 
Disarm? " takes the question on its economical side 
and returns a cautious answer, seeing in the return 
to civil life of the present array of soldiery, and in 
the disturbance to manufactures caused by the 
cessation of the demand for warlike material, a 
double objection not to be lightly overcome. And 
Dr. Trueblood's " Federation of the World " is, 
again, a plea for the world-wide solidarity which 
Kant dreamed of and Tennyson sang : well consid- 
ered, logical, cogent, conclusive, and, in the light 
of America's present attitude, impossible. 

Mr. Johnston's history is, of all issued so far, the 
only one which pretends to philosophy. Though 
himself carried away by the glamour of empire, he 
is not wholly blinded to the possibilities of the 
overthrow of our national inheritance. His work 
is succinct, never discursive, manifestly fair as such 
histories are, but not sufficiently extended to take in 
the present struggle for liberty on behalf of the 
Filipinos. The other books, without exception, 
point to the fact that Russia is merely the leader 
of a sentiment toward disarmament which i- grow- 
ing rapidly in all the world outside the United 
States except in some of the adjacent countries, 
like Mexico, which are arming in fear of this coun- 
try's present sinister attitude. All serve to empha- 
size the shameful fact that lack of statesmanship in 
America permits us to clamor for empire to extend 
our trade in the face of a tariff designed for no pur- 
pose but to prevent it now carried to its logical 
and unconstitutional extremity in being raised 
against Puerto Rico ; in blaming Russia for wrest- 
ing autonomy from Finland, while we are seeking 
to deprive the Philippines and Cuba of all govern- 
ment not based upon the sword ; of preaching the 
benefits of a republic, when we deny, either actu- 
ally or theoretically, our suffrage to all who are not 
of the white race ; of advocating arbitration after 
engaging in a war in which we had refused it ; and 
of interesting ourselves in international disarma- 
ment at the very moment we are increasing our 
standing army and navy to an extent unprecedented 
in our history. WALLACE RICK.

Hanger (ocribner) forms a capital 
yarn, a rather perilous one, we should think, to 
put in the hands of a boy of adventurous tastes. 
When we say "yarn " we do n't mean to hint a doubt 
of Mr. Jennings's veracity. On the contrary, we 
find reason to think that he has been, as he claims, 
a veritable " Ranger," a hunter of outlaws, in 
the storied days when the Lone Star State was 
the paradise of gentlemen who lived as they listed 
and died with their boots on. Mr. Jennings went 
out to Texas, a youth of eighteen, in 1874. He 
was the home-bred son of a Philadelphia merchant, 
enticed from the sober ideals of the city of broad- 
brims by the lurid articles of Colonel J. A. Knox, 
in the " Texas New Yorker." Colonel Knox's paper 
assured Mr. Jennings that he need only go to Texas 
to become a cattle-king and the owner of a county 
or so of land ; so he set out, with his father's bless- 
ing and one hundred dollars in cash, to take pos- 
session. Arrived at San Antonio, his $100 had 
shrunk to $3.25. A Mexican gaming-house relieved 
him of this last shot in the locker; and a brief 
career of " cow-punching," clerking, filibustering, 
and what not, followed. At last Mr. Jennings 
succeeded in joining the famous " Rangers," under 
Captain McNelly, with which corps he served 
until late in 1879. The story of his adventures is 
simply and graphically told, and it gives one a very 
fair idea of the character of the Rangers, as well as 
of the more famous of the desperadoes who were 
" wanted " by the authorities for one atrocious 
crime or another. In his opening chapter the 
author bears witness to the great change for the 
better in the social conditions of Texas, since the 
seventies. " In no State in the Union is the law 
more respected than it is in Texas to-day." Mr. 
Jennings has in some instances changed the names 
of persons introduced in the narrative ; for, he sig- 
nificantly says : " During a recent visit to Texas, 
for the purpose of going over the scenes of the ad- 
ventures of early days, I found a number of highly 
respected citizens, living exemplary lives, who had 
formerly been eagerly hunted by officers of the law." 

Mr. Fisher Unwin's " Library of 
Literary History," of which the 
Messrs. Scribner are the American 
publishers, has proved thus far to be an extremely 
creditable undertaking. Mr. Frazer's " Literary 
History of India," which opened the series, has 
already been noticed by us, and there now comes 
to our table " A Literary History of Ireland," by 
Dr. Douglas Hyde. An interesting announcement 
is that of "A Literary History of the United States," 
by Professor Barrett Wendell. The publishers and 
editors have been well advised in placing the pre- 
paration of the present volume in the hands of Dr. 
Hyde, who is probably the most competent scholar

living for the performance of such a piece of work. 
His acquaintance with the subject is both extensive 
and profound, and he is the master of a polished 
and interesting style. Moreover, the distinction 
between " A Literary History of Ireland " and a 
" History of Irish Literature " gives the author suit- 
able latitude for the development of his theme. Had 
his subject taken the latter form, this big book of 
six hundred and fifty pages could hardly have been 
justified ; as it is, the author remains within legiti- 
mate bounds, and is yet free to express himself 
fully. A " Literary History of Irish Ireland " he 
himself calls the book, for he has nothing to say of 
what was done by Swift, Goldsmith, and Burke, 
but confines himself to writings in the vernacular. 
The book is largely the history of an unprinted lit- 
erature a literature preserved only in manuscripts 
and oral tradition. Over a thousand such manu- 
scripts are known, with contents extending to per- 
haps twenty thousand pieces of all lengths, from 
the single quatrain to the epic saga. It was less 
than twenty years ago when, in the author's own 
alma mater, a popular lecturer said, "in gross 
ignorance but perfect good faith, that the sooner 
the Irish recognized that before the arrival of 
Cromwell they were utter savages, the better it 
would be for all concerned." It is to controvert 
such reckless statements as this that Dr. Hyde has 
so effectively labored, and it is not suprising that 
the note of indignation escapes him now and then. 
We do not pretend to review this book, which is 
the first attempt at a consecutive treatment of the 
subject that has been made. We doubt if there is 
a Celtic scholar in America whose attempt to pass 
critical judgment upon it would not be an imperti-

Dr. Hyde's scholarship and to the attractiveness of 
his work, and we place the book among our stand-

published annually, and of the great- 
est usefulness to editors and literary workers. The 
publishers of " Who 's Who in America " (A. N. Mar- 
quis & Co.) have taken the English work as a model, 
although not for slavish imitation, and have produced 
a volume that in the strictest sense supplies a long- felt 
want. It is a biographical dictionary of Americans 
now living, and distinguished for their achievements 
in literature, education, statesmanship, science, com- 
merce, or other fields of activity. The biographies 
give only the essential facts, and the form of state- 
ment is as condensed as possible. Since, in nearly 
all cases, the facts stated have been submitted for 
verification to the subjects concerned, the work is 
highly trustworthy. We hasten to add that the 
editor has been duly critical of the material offered 
him, and has strictly suppressed the efforts of self- 
seeking mediocrities to gain admission to its pages. 
He claims for his book " the virtue of being honestly 
and conscientiously compiled," and, after a rather

close examination, we see no reason to suspect the 
genuineness of the claim. The preface gives some 
amusing incidents concerning, on the one hand, the 
difficulties experienced in extracting information 
from some of the people approached, and, on the 
other, the sort of wire-pulling done by people who 
were not approached in order to attract attention 
to their unimportant selves. The exact number of 
biographies included is 8602, which is rather more 
than one to ten thousand of our population. To 
the State of New York 2039 are credited, to Massa- 
chusetts 742, to the District of Columbia 724, to 
Pennsylvania 622, and to Illinois 564. There is 
an interesting table of educational statistics, show- 
ing that 3237 are graduates of colleges, besides 
an odd thousand of graduates from professional 
schools. Another useful feature is a necrology of 
persons who have died since January 1, 1895. Mr. 
John W. Leonard is the editor of this work, which 
will be found indispensable by many classes of 
people. 

The first number of "The Anglo- 
Saxon Review," Lady Randolph 
Spencer Churchill's new periodical, 
has come to hand, and justifies all that has been 
promised for it from the artistic and mechanical 
points of view. The sumptuous binding in full 
morocco copies a cover made in Paris by some un- 
known artist of the late sixteenth century for King 
James I. The illustrations are reproductions of 
seven famous portraits, including Stuart's Washing- 
ton, Reynolds's Georgians, Duchess of Devonshire, 
Rubens's Anne of Austria, and Mr. Onslow Ford's 
bust of Queen Victoria. As for the literary con- 
tributors, it would take archangels to live up to all 
this magnificence of decoration and typography, and 
Mr. Whitelaw Reid, for example, is not exactly an 
archangel. He discourses of " Some Consequences 
of the Last Treaty of Paris." There are stories by 
Mr. Henry James, Miss Elizabeth Robins, and Mr. 
Gilbert Parker, a three-act play by Mrs. Craigie, a 
great poem by Mr. Swinburne, a masterly study of 
Peel by Lord Rosebery, and many other interest- 
ing things. Altogether, the literary make-up of the 
number is highly creditable to the taste and sagac- 
ity of the editor. The volume is one of more than 
two hundred and fifty pages, and Mr. John Lane 
is the American publisher. 

How to write a pastoral nowadays 
is a curious question. Pastorals, in 
the strict sense of the word, have 
been for some time lacking in our poetry. Herrick's 
" Hock-cart " was one of the last genuine pastorals ; 
Thomson and Crabbe seem, on different sides, a 
little wide of the line. What would a modern pas- 
toral be? We suppose it must be realistic to a cer- 
tain degree : a generation which has known Joseph 
Poorgrass and the other worthies of Wessex is not 
likely to accept vague shepherds piping on banks 
of lilies or swains leading up the dance beneath the 
village tree. Then it must be romantic, too, with 



A modern 
pastoral. 



the romance of nature, with that feeling for the 
strangeness and mystery of the deep woods and 
open uplands that is one of the notes of the poetry 
of this century. Then probably it must be idealistic, 
in that each figure and character must be sur- 
charged with the feeling or atmosphere of some 
mood or tendency in thought ; for that is something 
we cannot escape now. And it should also be 
classic: for the pastoral is a traditional form, it 
reminds us of the best periods of our literature, it 
is a form moulded by the touch of masters who are 
classic. All this perhaps one could say a priori. 
But we have not done so : we have run over these 
necessities only after reading Mr. Maurice Hewlett's 
" Pan and the Young Shepherd " (Lane). It is a 
delightful book for this time of the year. We have 
mentioned some characteristics that it may amuse 
the reader to note. But it may well be that the 
reader will prefer to pay no heed to such matters, 
but rather to follow simply the half-real dream as 
he lies on some summer hillside that stretches itself 
out to the sun and the sea. If this be his feeling, 
we shall not quarrel with it. 

There are possibly golf-players in 
this country who will remember the 
opinion prevailing, say five or six 
years ago, concerning the proper sphere of woman 
in the golfing universe. Such readers will smile 
(or sigh) as they look at " Our Lady of the Green : 
A Book about Ladies' Golf." by Louie Mackern 
and M. Boys (Lippincott). We shall not presume 
to judge the precise value of this work to feminine 
readers. So far as playing the game is concerned, 
we are inclined to think that if any book be useful 
it will be some book without distinction of sex. 
There is but one game of golf, and men and women 
play it, or try to, in much the same way. There 
are, however, certain minor matters concerning 
which women may well have something to say to 
each other, and these points our authors wisely 
make their chief topics. The special necessities of 
ladies' links, the delicacies incident to ladies' clubs 
and club teams, some particular points of play, 
notes on clothes, and so on, these are matters 
which an ordinary golf-book rather neglects, and 
the chapters here devoted to them may well find 
interested readers. It must also be remarked that 
this is an English book, and that about two-thirds 
of it will be useful on this side the water chiefly 
for reference. The account of the Ladies' Golf 
Union, the descriptions of ladies' links and of good 
" lady players," especially the directory of fifty 
ladies' clubs, which last takes up almost half the 
book, these parts are hardly exciting over here. 
Still, even these matters, while they are not of 
great immediate interest to us, make the book a 
useful one for a club library. One chapter will 
perhaps be a subject of serious interest to some en- 
terprising Americans, namely, that which discusses 
the advantages of the (possible) profession of Lady 
Greenkeeper and Professional.

Stars and 
Telescopes. 



Professor Todd's " Stars and Tele- 
scopes " (Little, Brown, & Co.) is not 
a school text-book in astronomy (al- 
though it might be put to that use), but rather a 
popular account of the subject for general reading. 
It is largely based upon Mr. William T. Lynn's 
" Celestial Motions," a book widely popular in En- 
gland, only a few of the chapters being Professor 
Todd's own. The subject of " The Cosmogony " 
receives special treatment in a chapter mainly writ- 
ten by Dr. See. The leading features of this vol- 
ume are found in its wealth of illustration (the 
plates and cuts are literally numbered by hundreds), 
its inclusion of the very latest results of research, 
its full account of existing observatories, and the 
space which it gives to the history of the science. 
Besides this, it succeeds in condensing an immense 
amount of information within reasonable limits, and 
without any sacrifice of clearness. Indeed, it is one 
of the most readable books upon astronomy that we 
have ever seen, being in this respect as attractive 
as the books of the late R. A. Proctor. Making 
no demands upon the mathematical resources of its 
readers, the book is admirably calculated to interest 
the layman in its fascinating subject. 

The late Irving Browne of Buffalo 
was known and beloved by book- 
collectors everywhere, and the sump- 
tuous volume containing his " Ballads of a Book- 
Worm " will not lack of readers. " Unless you 
love books aside from their contents do not read 
this book at all, it is not meant for mere readers," 
says Mr. Browne in his " Foreword "; but we think 
there are few, whether collectors or not, who could 
fail to enjoy the genial humor and good-natured 
satire of these pleasant little " thoughts, fancies, 
and adventures a-collecting." In the mechanical 
production of the volume Mr. Hubbard and his 
associates of the Roycroft Press have surpassed 
even themselves. Paper, presswork, and binding 
are all of the best, and the large hand-colored ini- 
tial letters scattered throughout the book are beau- 
tifully executed. Altogether it is a volume to 
gladden the heart of the bibliophile, and one of 
which the Roycrofters may well be proud. 



A composite 
Life of 
Gladstone. 



The two-volume " Life of Gladstone" 
(Putnam), edited by Sir Wemyss 
Reid, is put together on factory prin- 
ciples, each part of the finished product being the 
work of a special hand to whom was assigned the 
" job " he was thought best qualified to cope with. 
The political portion of the narrative is mainly 
from the pen of Mr. F. W. Hirst, who contributes 
twelve out of the total of twenty chapters. Mr. 
F. A. Robbins writes of Mr. Gladstone's ancestry 
and earlier years ; Mr. Arthur J. Butler describes 
him as Scholar, Canon McColl as Theologian, the 
Rev. W. Tuckwell as Critic, Sir Henry W. Lucy as 
Orator, and so on. As a result of all this collab- 
oration and specialization the work gives an impres- 



sion of scrappiness, and it must be read in parts and 
passim to be enjoyed. But it is matterful and 
graphic, and its pictures are profuse and pleasantly 
miscellaneous. Meanwhile, the critical world looks 
expectantly to Mr. John Morley, who will, we trust, in 
his forthcoming biographical venture, give us mainly 
biography proper, and not political and social philos- 
ophy with a slight leaven of biography, as his wont has 
been heretofore. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" How to Swim " is the title of a practical treatise 
upon the art in question, by Captain Davis Dalton (who 
certainly knows how), just published by Messrs. Putnam. 

A new edition of " What Women Can Earn " has 
just been published by the Frederick A. Stokes Co. 
Many young women who seek to become self-supporting 
are likely to find helpful guidance in this volume of 
papers by many hands. 

An announcement of interest to librarians, book- 
sellers, and all book buyers, is " The United States 
Catalog," [stc] giving author and title of all books in 
print to date. It is issued by Mr. H. W. Wilson, of 
Messrs. Morris & Wilson, Minneapolis. 

The publishers of " The Atlantic Monthly " announce 
that Mr. Walter H. Page has resigned the editorship of 
the magazine to accept a position in the allied houses of 
Harper & Brothers and the Doubleday & McClure Co. 
He will be succeeded by Mr. Bliss Perry, well-known as 
essayist and story writer, and lately professor of English 
at Princeton University. 

A new series of literary primers is about to be pub- 
lished by the Macmillaii Co. " Temple Primers " they 
are called, being similar in form to the " Temple " edi- 
tions of Shakespeare and other English classics. A 
primer on Dante, by Mr. E. G. Gardner, will be the 
first publication in this series. Apropos of the " Temple" 
Shakespeare, the publishers anuounce a reissue, reset in 
larger type, and richly illustrated from antiquarian 
sources. It will fill twelve volumes, designed for the 
library, not for the pocket, and will remain under the 
editorship of Mr. Gollancz. 

Mrs. Voynich, whose novel, " The Gadfly," has 
already had to be printed in this country seventeen 
times, arrived in New York the other day. The drama- 
tization of the novel will be given in September, with 
Mr. Stuart Robson as the Gadfly and Miss Marie Bur- 
roughs as the Amazonian Gemma. Mrs. Voynich brings 
with her numerous photographs and sketches of the 
quaint architecture and characteristic scenery amid 
which the plot of the story takes its course. 

The death of Dr. Daniel Garrison Brinton, on the last 
day of July, at the age of sixty-two, was a serious loss 
to American scholarship. Dr. Brinton's authority upon 
matters of American ethnology and archaeology was of 
the highest, and his publications very numerous. Among 
them we may mention " Myths of the New World," 
" American Hero Myths," " Maya Chronicles," " Essays 
of an Americanist," and "Races and Peoples." Dr. 
Brinton was also a soldier in the Civil War, an editor 
of various scientific journals, and a professor in the 
University of Pennsylvania. Not long ago he presented 
to that institution his entire collection of books and 
manuscripts relating to the aboriginal languages of 
America, over two thousand titles in all.

THE SUCCESS OF A 

BOOK 



\ X 7 HEN it takes over a year to sell two thousand 
copies of a new novel by a popular author, the 
public and the publishers are apparently justified in 
thinking it a failure. If, however, it goes on selling 
steadily, if not largely, it evidently has some good 
qualities. When, then, at the end of three years, it 
has sold out four editions, a fifth is nearly exhausted, 
a sixth is in rapid preparation, and the sale is one 
thousand a month, the publisher is forced to believe 
that people like it. This is the case of

beginning with the September Number the retail price 
of HARPER'S MAGAZINE will be twenty-five cents 
a copy, and three dollars for each yearly subscription. 



No Reduction in Size or Quality. 

FROM its first introduction to the American public HARPER'S MAGAZINE 
has steadily grown in popular favor and appreciation. Received at first with 
spontaneous acclamation, it has for half a century retained its primacy in the house- 
hold regard and in the public esteem. In the largest sense it has been representa- 
tive of the best literature and of the best art of its time. With the December 
Number it will enter upon its hundredth volume in circumstances so auspicious 
as to give it an exceptional advantage. In its fifty years of existence it has wit- 
nessed many changes in the arts of illustrating and printing, and it has ever been 
a pioneer in adopting every new contrivance for beautifying its pages. During 
all these years improvements in machinery and processes have been such as to 
reduce the cost of manufacture to the point where the publishers are at length 
enabled to make a corresponding reduction to their readers, and while the price 
hereafter will be only twenty-five cents a copy, they take this opportunity to 
announce not only that the character of the MAGAZINE will be maintained at 
its present high standard, but also that every effort will be made to make it more 
attractive.

actions of the people and royalty, the aspirations of the prince, the intrigues surrounding 
him, the cares of state, and the craving for love, are some of the motives developed, with the 
accompaniments of incident and adventure, wherein the author proves his mastery of sus- 
pended interest and dramatic effect. In the subtle development of character nothing that 
this brilliant author has written is shrewder than this vivid picture of a king's inner life. It 
is a romance which will not only absorb the attention of readers, but impress them with a 
new admiration for the author's power. The novel is aptly and effectively illustrated by Mr. 
Frank T. Merrill. 

AVERAGES. 

By ELEANOR STUART, Author of " Stone Pastures." 

NOVELS of New York have sometimes failed through lack of knowledge of the theme, 
but the brilliant author of " Averages " and " Stone Pastures " has had every oppor- 
tunity to know her New York well. She has been able, therefore, to avoid the extremes of 
"high life " and " low life," which have seemed to many to constitute the only salient phases 
of New York, and she paints men and women of every day, and sketches the curious inter- 
dependence and association or impingement of differing circles in New York. There is a 
suggestion of the adventurer, a figure not unfamiliar to New Yorkers, and there are glimpses 
of professional life, and the existence of idlers. " Averages " is not a story of froth or slums, 
but a brilliant study of actualities, and its publication will attract increased attention to the 
rare talent of the author.

GOETHE IN STRASSBURG. 

Goethe reached StraSsburg on the second of 
April, 1770, being twenty years and seven months 
old. He remained there until August of the fol- 
lowing year, or until he had reached the age of 
twenty-two. If, as Uhland maintains, the Minster 
rustled all its stony foliage as young Goethe was 
carving his name into its tower, then may the ven- 
erable city itself well have felt a thrill throughout 
its foundations at the moment when the splendid 
youth first stepped down from the Frankfort post- 
coach in front of the " Spirit Inn." The three years 
of university life in Leipzig had been in many re- 
spects a disappointment to the young student, still 
more so to his ambitious father. It will not do to 
exalt one ideal of culture by depreciating the best 
which has been developed elsewhere: it was no 
wonder that, in the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the proud splendors of the French power and 
intellect arrested the wondering attention of "Vet- 
ter Michel," just rubbing his eyes and coming to the 
consciousness of his own possibilities. Paris was 
recognized as the centre of the world's elegance and 
civilization, and these things are not so cheap or 
powerless that they can be lightly reckoned with. 
If Esau, by association with his " smooth " brother, 
can subdue something of his own redness and hair- 
iness, it will not be to his disadvantage : but let him 
give good heed to it that he do not at the same time 
part with his peculiar birthright for a mess of pot- 
tage. Our accusation against Leipzig, the " Paris in 
miniature" that " refined its people," is that it subsist- 
ed entirely on borrowed culture: elegance, gallantry, 
and fine taste were its law and gospel, and this code 
was enforced by the dictation of an unusually close 
corporation of organized social influences. 

The youth from Frankfort, who had by no means 
come from a milieu which represented the ultra- 
exclusive set even in that somewhat patriarchal city, 
was imposed upon and brought into subjection by 
this affected, precious, superficially-clever, heart- 
suppressing, conventional aristocracy : his Pegasus, 
docked and groomed, in a gilded harness and with 
the tightest of check-reins, minced along before a 
stylish barouche, instead of soaring with mighty 
wing over the tops of all mountains. On returning 
to Frankfort, he finds that very German place a 
rude, cheerless den of Philistinism, and it is in hope 
of going farther under the tutelage of the " grand 
nation " that he betakes himself to the French city, 
Strassburg, to complete his studies. He makes a 
goodly sight as he steps down from the post-coach 
lately mentioned. Robert Louis Stevenson remarks

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



that he never saw any man who seemed worthy to 
inspire love, no, nor read of any, except Leonardo 
da Vinci, and perhaps Goethe in his youth. The 
year and a half of imprisonment in the sick-room is 
over : his powers are equal to what is to be de- 
mantled of them ; he brings once more ebullient 
youthful spirits, joy, courage, and the fire of life, 
a wealth of sensibility and responsiveness to all j 
esthetic influences. He is ready to win immediate 
confidence, and is of a nature which goes out to 
others and delights to make friend*. Moreover, he 
has all the prepossession which derives from a beau- 
tiful person, elegance of fashion, and an abundance 
of money. Under the influence of the " beautiful 
spirit," Fraulein von Klettenberg, there has lately 
occurred an awakening of the religious nature, and 
be holds that earnest theory of life which gives it 
dignity and meaning. 

A discovery which the young man soon makes is, 
that Strassburg, upon nominally French soil, is far 
more German than had been Leipzig, in the very 
heart of Germany. The result of his life here is 
the opening of his eyes to what the spirit of bis own 
people is, and his being forever saved for that spirit, 
to become its embodiment and its prophet. The 
intellectually-ambitious group of men at his boarding- 
house is German, using his native tongue. As was 
natural enough, these striving young spirits made 
themselves acquainted with the superb achieve- 
ments of the French mind, and received therefrom 
a quickening of power and an expanded ideal, but 
they were too earnest, genuine, and hearty to be 
bound over to the worship of passing idols. 

It was in Strassburg that Goethe's heart re- 
sponded to the mighty charm of the natural beauty 
of his own country, an element in the German tem- 
perament which has been of priceless poetic value, 
and one which we, in our great and beautiful and 
rich land, for the most part have either failed to 
develope, or have tamely allowed ourselves to be 
robbed of. Industrialism, the selfishness of capital, 
which rushes by the shortest way to get the largest 
immediate money-returns without waiting until the 
natural right of the people to beauty in their daily 
surroundings has been made sure, builds its ugly fac- 
tories, disfigures our cities with tasteless buildings, 
uncared-for streets, telegraph-poles, grim skeletons 
of bridges and elevated roads, cuts up our landscape 
with hideous fences, and seizes upon natural points of 
picturesque vantage which should be forever held by 
the people and for the people, as they are in Ger- 
many ! The man among us who puts up unsightly 
houses and unpainted sheds is neither molested by 
law nor visited by lynching-parties, whereas in 
Germany there would be as universal a riot in such 
a case as if a well-known brewery should attempt to 
adulterate a favorite beer. The German landscape 
(for such it must be called) of Alsace disclosed itself 
with magic beauty to Goethe upon his very arrival, 
for almost the first thing which he did was to climb 
to the top of the cathedral and gain a view of the 
panorama which lay spread before him. He never 



wearied of celebrating the praises of the beauty of 
Alsace, its rocks and hills, its forests and fields, 
rivers, meadows, and towns. From Goethe in 
Strassburg we date that masterly treatment of Na- 
ture in literature, at the same time sentimental and 
realistic, which came as an enlivening power into 
German letters, and to which we owe no little of 
the imperishable charm of " Werther " and a thou- 
sand secondary streams which flowed from that 
refreshing source. 

As medieval Strassburg had itself been one of 
the greatest achievements of German national spirit 
and character, so was its cathedral a mighty work 
of Gothic architecture, an expression of the vigor of 
the German soul which had long waited the voice 
which should tell abroad its power and meaning. 
In Goethe the voice was found to herald forth this 
truth in joyous polemic. In Leipzig, under the 
influence of the pseudo-Grecian French classicism, 
the term "Gothic " had meant to him (as to other 
people who made a conscience of being strictly 
"correct" and contemporary in matters of taste) 
the sum-total of all that was chaotic, inorganic, un- 
natural, over-loaded, and patched-together ; signifi- 
cantly, however, the object to which he eagerly 
turned his first footsteps was this great monument, 
and it made the complete conquest of his great 
spirit; from the moment of this visit, he was its 
victim, its devotee, and in silence and apart he gave 
himself up to it, immersed himself in it, until it 
began like every majestic work of art, and upon 
the only conditions under which anything superla- 
tively great and good ever yields up its riddle to 
gradually whisper to him who had so reverently 
surrendered himself to it the secret of its spell. 
With the awakening of the native German spirit 
within him, he began to look upon this cathedral as 
an organic outgrowth of the German soul, and to 
recognize its significance in that great lesson for his 
age and his people : 

" Ans Vaterland, ana teure, schlieas dich an. 
Das halte feat niit deinem ganzen Herzen ! 
Hier Bind die starken Wurzeln deiner Kraft." 

" Our age," he cries out in his tribute to the noble 
building, has surrendered its own heritage, it has 
sent its sons abroad to gather foreign products to 
their own destruction. Our native genius must not 
consent to soar aloft on any borrowed wings even 
though they were the very wings of the morning! " 
This new consciousness, which dared to assert the 
right-to-be of an architecture not appropriated bod- 
ily from ancient Greece, has in our own century 
brought to conclusion the Cathedral of Cologne and 
the Minster of Ulrn, and rescued them, in full beauty 
and honor, to be a joy to ages yet to come. 

Our young student by no means adopts that 
hedonistic theory of life which makes beer ami 
skittles " the object of existence: he has an almost 
unnatural appreciation of the unique formative value 
of this period for his whole future. As he writes, 
' The years at the university by right demand the 
concentrated exercise of all of one's intellectual

powers. It is the time, the good or careless use of 
which we continue to feel throughout life." Emer- 
son, in " Representative Men," sums up Goethe's 
aim as Culture : not what a man can accomplish, but 
what can be accomplished in him. This earnest and 
untiring striving " in virum perfectum " is the note 
of Goethe's entire student-lite in Strassburg. He 
recognizes that the student must not lay claim to be, 
but must be content to become ; that when he ven- 
tures to look with complacency upon any complete 
attainment, that very hour he ceases to be a true 
student. The group to which he belongs is domi- 
nated by a passion for right critical judgment, and 
for an understanding of the reasons which underlie 
it ;' and yet he perceives that the attempt to make a 
final analysis of aesthetic sensations is an elusive 
quest. " Beauty is, once for all, inexplicable : it is 
a wavering, glittering vision, whose contour can be 
fixed by no definition ; the case is like catching 
butterflies : the poor creature flutters in the net and 
rubs off its most beautiful colors ; even if we can 
capture it uninjured, we keep it as something stiff 
and lifeless the dead body is not the entire crea- 
ture, something is missing, an important something, 
and, in this instance, as in all similar ones, a very 
superlatively important thing : the life, the spirit 
which animates the whole." Pretty sound aesthetics 
this, in a familiar letter of a student who is not 
twenty-one years old ! Along with theory goes prac- 
tice in writing, which brings his best resources into 
play, and which developes, even here, a sound, clear, 
and full-flowing style. How catholic and mature 
the tastes, how full the acquisitions, which 'he has 
brought with him, can only be indicated. In Leip- 
zig and Frankfort he had already taken on a stately 
freight of information in the fields of philosophy 
and theology, jurisprudence and political economy, 
medicine and natural sciences, history and antiqui- 
ties, art and poetry. His eager mind lays hold of 
everything which interests the human spirit. There 
were the ancient classics, works on art, law-studies 
taken up vigorously ; German history and antiqui- 
ties, German authors, from Luther down ; studies of 
the Strassburg dialect and the folk-songs of Alsace ; 
natural history, electricity, travel, and medicine ; 
the young man also elected some serious courses in 
chemistry and anatomy. In English there were 
Shakespeare, Goldsmith, and Smollet, Percy's Re- 
liques, Ossian and ancient Scottish ballads ; in French, 
an energetic and penetrating study of the poets and 
thinkers, and as was natural in Strassburg an 
attempt at the practical mastery of the language 
itself, in which (in spite of the most favorable con- 
ditions) Goethe himself concludes to be content with 
a relative perfection. Goethe's practical achieve- 
ments in English, which he had pursued from youth 
up, and to which he had especially applied himself 
in the Leipzig days, have left some monuments be- 
hind them. Some comfort may be derived by those 
who are struggling with an alien idiom in reading 
his English letters to his sister during this period. 



" The father . . . would see if I write as good en- 
glish as Lupton german. . . . Lupton is a good fellow, 
a marry, invetious fellow as I see it in his letter, which 
is wroten whit a spirit of jest, much laudably moderated 
by the respect, he owes to his master. But one can see, 
that he is no yet acquainted, with the fair and delicate 
manners of our language. . . . Think on it sister thou 
art a happy maiden, to have a brother who makes english 
veses. I pray thee be not haugty thereof. 

" A SONG OVER THE UNCONFIDENCE TOWARDS 

MY SELF. 
" Thou knowest how heappily they Freind 

Walks upon florid Ways ; 
Thou knowst how heavens bounteous hand 
Leads him to golden days. 

" But hah ! a cruel ennemy 
Destroies all that Bless ; 
In Moments of Melancholy 
Flies all my Heappiness. . . . 

" But when they then my prayer not hear 

I break my wispring lire ; 
Then from my eyes runns down a tear, 
Extinguish th' incensed fire. 

" Then curse I. Freind, the fated sky, 

And from th' altar I fly ; 
And to my Freinds aloud I cry 
Be happier then I. ... 

" Truely, my english knowledge is very little, but i'll 
gather all my forces, to perfection it. Visiting my let- 
ters, ye shall have found many faults, ye may pardon." 

Further, we have this gallant defence of a maiden 
who has made an undesirable match : 

" But sister, let us dam no man. I 've courage enough 
to take her party. Think her education sister, and then 
dam her if thou darest. A maiden, of no great natural 
genius, she lives her first Years in the company of her 
parents and sisters. They are all homiest men, but how 
form a womens heart to his heapyness they understand 
not." 

The psychological truth here is perhaps more to be 
admired than the form in which it is put. 

The hundred varied interests, all so keenly pur- 
sued, split up the days, to be sure, but as Goethe 
said, " One has always time enough when one wishes 
to employ it well," and he accomplished roundly 
whatever he undertook. There is no priggishness 
or arid self-consciousness in all this striving : he has 
a fresh sympathy which causes other young men to 
seek his advice, a pretty good test. He warns 
such a friend against idealizing him, and, with all 
that he has done and learned, he counts himself far 
from wise enough to give counsel, in both respects 
offering suggestions for our own generation of stu- 
dents, among whom a talented and moderately- 
equipped young head has often the manner of know- 
ing more about everything than any one person can 
possibly know about anything. 

Who shall do justice to that simple love-story of 
Sesenheim, in its happy, peaceful rural setting, an 
idyl imperishable in its power to make us forget 
" The fardel coarse of customary life 's 
Exceeding injucundity ." 

Friederike is one of those dear maidens who are 
forever surrounded by a refreshing ether, a hover-

ing minister of joy to others, full of capable help- 
fulness, worthy of all respect and love, combining in 
rare balance those happy extremes of gaiety and 
discretion, prudence and light-hearted ness, naivete 
and self-consciousness. She is an " out-of-doors " 
girl, seen at her beat when running like a light- 
footed deer over a rustic path, vying in graceful 
charm with the flowering fields, and in indestructi- 
ble cheerfulness with the blue sky above her little 
blonde head, 

" And round her happy fooUtep* blow 
The authentic ain of ParadiM." 

The love came naturally and truly, " as though in 
sport." Five days after their meeting we have the 
young man's first letter, which reveals to us that 
two hearts have found and understood each other. 
It is a love that makes him thrice a man," in 
Tennyson's phrase, that heightened his powers of 
creation and expression, which had been starved and 
frozen in superfine society : in " Kleine Blunaen, 
kleine Blatter " is reached the crowning glory of all 
lighter German lyrics (thus Erich Schmidt, princeps 
literatorum). We do not excuse the young man's 
though tleasness in not having fully reasoned out the 
result, while allowing himself to gravitate easily and 
deeply into the relation of accepted son-in-law ; if it 
was really due to the integrity of his great life- plan 
that he should not be permanently hampered by a 
nature as limited in certain directions as waa hers 
(though some later facts cast a grim light on this 
theory), he should have had courage to rend sooner 
the flowery fetters which were binding two lives 
closer and closer. 

In Strassburg, then, Goethe found the true canon 
of poetry, " Look in thy heart, and write "; he 
escaped from conceits and conventionalities to life, 
and to the faith that poetry is the necessary outlet 
for the pressure of deep, powerful emotions. 

Nor will we by any means reckon it the least 
important gain of the student-days in Strassburg 
that it was there that the youth, with all his gaiety, 
came under the tonic influence of Herder, the man 
who had fought his way, with baffled blows, on a 
bitter field of adversity, and had learned the reali- 
ties of life, and how to estimate them comparatively. 
Irritable and censorious, he never approved or was 
satisfied with Goethe's work, and the greatness with 
which the cheerful student submitted to this trench- 
ant dogmatism is not to be unnoticed as a mark of 
his magnanimity. Herder taught him the popular 
nature of true poetry, that it is the necessary pro- 
duct of the inner consciousness of a nation or a 
race; he disclosed to him the poverty of German 
literature, caused Goethe even to doubt his own 
powers, and led him to the deep well of the Hebrew 
poets, to Odsian, and above all to Shakespeare. As 
Keats, on first looking into Chapman's Homer, felt 

" like some watcher of the ikies 
When a new planet iwims into hi ken," 

so our young poet, under the magisterial guidance 
of Herder, experienced with a wonderful power that 



by Shakespeare his being had been infinitely wid- 
ened, that all things had become new and strange. 
' The first page which I read made me his captive 
forever ; and when I had finished one work of his, 
I stood like a man born blind, whose sight had been 
restored by a miracle." To Shakespeare he sur- 
rendered himself unconditionally, even as he had 
already capitulated to the cathedral. 

From this Strassburg stage, equipped with the 
resources which it has brought, our young hero goes 
forth to create, one after another, those noble works 
of art which have become the priceless treasure of 
humanity. It is one of the sacred trusts committed 
to each generation, that it shall preserve these works 
in their freshness and perfection, and transmit them, 
unimpaired, to the ages which are to come.

COMMUNICA TION. 



THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR CHILDREN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the matter of selecting the right books for our 
children, we still have to " educate our educators," and 
your recent article on the subject, Mr. Walter Taylor 
Field's letter in your issue of August 1, together with 
many other important utterances of men and women of 
authority, which have been put forth during the past 
few years, all tend to show a steady growth of a wiser 
and healthier public opinion. 

We can reach our little ones only through the home 
and through the school, and I believe that the old- 
fashioned reading books, full of orts and scraps of lit- 
erature, thrown together with no intelligent grouping 
or with no plan of correlation, have had much to do with 
the begetting of the craving for the " tidbit " class of 
reading which is so much to be deplored. Newspapers 
and magazines have long fostered and encouraged this 
taste. 

An important duty devolving upon those who pro- 
vide and select reading for the young is that of encour- 
aging more concentration and less desultoriness; and 
we shall secure the concentrated attention of the chil- 
dren if we give them the right books. The world's 
literature is full of pleasure-books which stimulate and 
uplift while they delight, books which the children 
can enjoy without taking barm. "There is a land of 
pure delight, where books immortal reign," and it is to 
this land that we would guide the willing feet of our 
little ones. These views are recognized by all our ad- 
vanced educational authorities, and there is a growing 
tendency to give children books in their entirety, instead 
of bits from books, or editions of classic works in which 
everything but the movement and incident have been 
eliminated. 

No book has suffered more from this treatment than 
" Robinson Crusoe," and of the countless editions on 
the market there are scarcely any complete ones issued 
at a popular price. When I read " Robinson Crusoe " 
as a boy at school, in an edition denuded of everything 
but the doings of the hero, I wondered in a boyish way 
how he must have felt at being thus alone on a desert 
island. I imagined his fears and his terrors, and when

in later years I read the book in its completed form I 
found that its author had made it not only a book of 
exciting action, but full of psychological interest, 
scarcely any of which would be beyond the understand- 
ing of the young reader, because it is the logical out- 
come of the situation in which Robinson Crusoe found 
himself. 

Books should be as carefully selected for children as 
the food they eat, and young people should not be 
allowed to browse among books that have not been se- 
lected for them, to range free over every field and pas- 
ture. They may have an instinct of food which more 
cultivated palates lose; but it is an error to suppose 
that evil will always fall off their minds like water 
from a duck's back. If they are not harmed by what 
they do not understand, and if they often assimilate 
what is of use to them, and what no one would ever 
have dreamed of suggesting to them, it is difficult for 
any of us to say exactly when the understanding of 
harm does begin, and it is better to keep children alto- 
gether away from the possibility of it in their reading. 
" Art is noble, but the sanctity of a human soul is 
nobler still," and it is impossible to say at what stage 
the passions cease to be silent, and tastes have been 
formed. 

Dr. Johnson says: " I would put a child into a library 
where no unfit books are, and let him read at his choice. 
A child should not be discouraged from reading any- 
thing which he takes a liking to, because it is above his 
reach. If this is the case, the child will soon find out 
and desist; if not, he of course gains the instruction, 
which is so much the more likely to come from the 
inclination with which he takes up the study." All very 
good and true; but books are good for boys and girls 
only as they are ready for them. It often happens that 
when a child has taken up a book that has failed to 
interest him, it has left a memory behind which has 
prevented him from looking into it when he has come 
across it again in later life. If he had found the book 
when he was ready for it, it would have fallen on good 
ground and brought forth fruit. So we should provide 
groups of books for children to select from, not seeking 
books which we think a child ought to be ready for at 
a certain stage of his development, and force them 
upon him, but we should let him have a wide range, 
within certain very broad limits; and in making the 
selection it may be generally said that the prime requi- 
sites in the reading to be provided for the child are, 
that it should be interesting, wholesome, true, and good 
literature. With these criteria in mind, the task should 
not be so difficult as it may at first sight appear. 

While I am generally in sympathy with all that Mr. 
Walter Taylor Field says in the letter to which I have 
referred above, I think that he is a little hard on "Jack 
the Giant-Killer." I would not feed children on tales 
of ogres and giants who eat up little boys, nor encour- 
age the reading of the boy bandit and Wild West 
stories of the news stand; but we cannot shut our eyes 
to the fact that boys must have their fights with the 
Indians, their adventures by sea and land, their hair- 
breadth escapes by flood and field, in their reading. 
The love of fight is biological and self-preservative. We 
cannot eradicate it if we would, and we would not erad- 
icate it if we could. There is plenty of it, however,, in 
the classic works' of our great authors, without going 
to the dime novel to find it.

will be welcomed by a large constituency of 
appreciative readers. He was the son of Joshua 
and Sally Stevens, and was born on the 4th of 
April, 1792, in Danville, Vermont, where the 
principal peaks of the White and Franconia 
Mountains and the Green Mountains are vis- 
ible. Of his ancestry but little is known, but 
they were of Anglo-Saxon stock. His father 
was desperately poor, and wanting in enterprise 
and thrift ; but according to all accounts his 
mother was a woman of remarkable character 
and strength of mind. Thaddeus was a sickly 
child, and as he could not work on the farm 
his mother sent him to Dartmouth College, in 
which he graduated at the age of twenty-two. 
Mr. McCall gives the chief incidents in the 
pioneer life of Stevens, and the story recalls 
the kindred experience of many famous Amer- 
icans who have fought their way through pov- 
erty and hardship to distinction and usefulness. 
We cannot dwell upon details. He chose the 
law as his profession, and finally located in 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where his brilliant 
success in the management of a remarkable 
murder case at once made him locally famous. 
In 1842 he removed to Lancaster, where he 
immediately took high rank as a lawyer. 

In the early days of his practice he took no 
part in politics. The Federal party, to which 
he had been attached, had passed away. The 
party headed by Jackson had no charm for him. 
When the abduction and murder of Morgan 
created the Anti-Masonic party, he became one 
of its leaders. The movement disappointed 
him, however, and he identified himself with 
the Whig party, which was then coming to the 
front. He took the stump for Harrison in 
1840, and for Clay in 1844. In the meantime 
he had distinguished himself in the convention 
which met in 1837 to amend the constitution 
of the State, boldly avowing the radical anti- 
slavery opinions of his later life. In the leg- 
islature of 1834 he had espoused the policy of 
free public schools, which aroused a perfect 
tempest of opposition throughout the State ; 
but by the phenomenal power of a single great 
speech he turned the tables upon his opponents,

made himself the idol of the State, and won a 
victory which he regarded as the greatest 
achievement of his life. His service in the state 
legislature extending through a series of years, 
was distinguished by rare courage and inde- 
pendence, by great ability in debate, and by a 
ready wit which he always employed with un- 
erring effect. His reputation, however, was 
bounded by State lines until his first election 
to Congress in 1849, when fifty-eight years of 
age. The way was now opened for his leader- 
ship in a wider field. The acquisition of for- 
eign territory had made slavery the overshadow- 
ing question, and the seriousness of the crisis 
was unprecedented. Probably no Congress 
since the formation of the government had con- 
tained more eminent men. Stevens was a new 
member, though well advanced in years. He 
was in no haste to assert himself, and when 
urged to do so said, " I will tarry at Jericho till 
my beard grows." He did not dream of the 
fame which awaited him as a great party leader. 
The slave power was then in the ascendant, 
and of course would handicap such a man in 
the organization of the committees ; but it could 
not silence him. His training as a lawyer and 
his extended experience in the State legislature 
had prepared him for his task. Stevens was 
an anti-slavery Whig, and the nine Free Soil 
members of the House held the balance of 
power between the old parties, and voted for 
him for Speaker. Cobb of Georgia was finally 
elected. Stevens hated slavery with an in- 
tensity which would be difficult to characterize. 
It was a passion, as seen in the several 
speeches made in this Congress, which com- 
pare favorably with the best literature of the 
anti-slavery crusade. He voted and spoke 
against all the compromise measures of 1850, 
and rebuked the servility of both Webster and 
Clay. He was a member of the House in the 
Thirty-second Congress, but the Anti-slavery 
agitation had greatly subsided, and his prin- 
cipal speech was devoted to the tariff. In 1859 
he reappeared in the Thirty-sixth Congress, in 
which he distinguished himself by his masterly 
leadership of the minority which resisted the 
cowardly tactics of the famous Committee of 
Thirty-three. 

Buf the great fact in the life of Stevens was 
his matchless leadership in dealing with the 
question of Reconstruction. That question 
involved the whole problem of the Civil War. 
Stevens so understood it, and in the very be- 
ginning of the war he sounded the cry of dan- 
ger. The plan of Reconstruction proposed by 



Lincoln, on the 8th of December, 1863, and 
known as the Presidential plan, under which 
Louisiana proceeded to establish a State gov- 
ernment, provided for no guardianship of the 
United States over the organization of State 
governments, no law to prescribe who should 
vote, no civil functionaries to see that the law 
was faithfully executed, no supervising author- 
ity to control the election. President Johnson's 
North Carolina order was exactly one in theory 
with Lincoln's Louisiana plan. It appointed 
a governor of North Carolina, and ordered him 
at the earliest practicable time to prescribe rules 
for convening a convention composed of dele- 
gates chosen by the loyal people of the State, the 
" loyal people" to include only those who should 
take the oath and receive the pardon provided 
for in the amnesty proclamation ; and they 
must be qualified voters according to the laws 
in force at the time of secession. Thus the 
work of Reconstruction was placed in the hands 
of the white race, and in effect was put in the 
control of those who had participated in the Re- 
bellion. Since the latter were greatly in the 
majority, the formation of the new Constitu- 
tion which was to establish the conditions of 
the suffrage and other fundamental rights was 
to be committed to their hands. In all these 
proceedings Congress had no voice. Recon- 
struction was dealt with as the exclusive prov- 
ince of the Executive, and was to be initiated 
in all the States whenever demanded by one- 
tenth as many votes as were cast in that State 
for President in 1860. Stevens had no patience 
with such hasty and slipshod legislation, which 
so plainly opened the way for the return of the 
rebels to power and the surrender of all that 
the war had established. 

The scheme of Reconstruction known as the 
Congressional plan, supported in the Senate by 
Wade and in the House by Winter Davis, pro- 
vided that the President should appoint a pro- 
visional governor in each of the States in Re- 
bellion, and that so soon as resistance to the 
national authority had ceased in any State the 
governor should enroll the white male citizens, 
and if a majority of them should take an oath 
to support the Constitution of the United 
States, then the election of delegates to a con- 
stitutional convention should be ordered. The 
State constitution should contain certain pro- 
visions, and when these had been complied with 
to the satisfaction of Congress the President 
should recognize the State government, and the 
State should thereupon be entitled to repre- 
sentation in Congress. Although the bill em-

bodying this plan was more stringent in its 
provisions than Lincoln's plan, Stevens would 
not accept it. He declared that it partially 
acknowledged the rebel States to have rights 
under the constitution, which he denied, insist- 
ing that war had abrogated them all. In this 
particular the supporters of the Congressional 
Plan agreed with the Democrats, who talked 
about " an indissoluble union of indestructible 
States " and opposed any sort of Reconstruc- 
tion. All that was necessary was for each of 
the seceded States to resume its place in the 
Union under the Constitution and laws of such 
State at the close of the conflict. 

It is true that if the Rebellion had been 
nipped in the bud, or had been abandoned be- 
fore it assumed its gigantic proportions, no 
reconstruction of the government would have 
been necessary. But when the conflict ceased 
to be any longer a mere insurrection against 
the national authority, and took upon itself the 
character of a war with a foreign power, as the 
Supreme Court of the United States decided, 
the insurgents became public enemies, and when 
conquered were the conquered enemies of the 
United States and subject to the power of the 
conqueror, according to the laws of war appli- 
cable to such a conflict. The nation had a per- 
fect right to prescribe just such conditions as 
it saw fit, looking to indemnity for the past and 
security for the future. To argue that the men 
who carried on this work of devastation for four 
years in the name of State Rights should be 
allowed at the end of the conflict to set up 
State Rights as a bar to their accountability 
and a reason for their unconditional restoration 
to power, was a mockery of justice and an insult 
to common sense. As citizens of the United 
States, they could no more escape their obliga- 
tions than they could run away from their own 
shadows. Through their treason and rebellion 
they lost their rights under the Union, but the 
Union lost none of its rights over them. Stevens 
so understood matters as early as the session of 
Congress beginning in December, 1861, and in 
every speech which he made on the subject he 
reiterated his views, which were far more rad- 
ical than those of his party, but which the party 
finally adopted, in substance. In opening the 
debate on Reconstruction, December 18, 1865, 
he attacked the position of both Lincoln and 
Johnson, which assumed that Reconstruction 
was within the province of the Executive. His 
argument was a Constitutional one, and after 
expounding his well-known views on this ques- 
tion he said that the Rebel States should not 



be admitted to the Union until the principles 
embodied in his proposed amendments to the 
Constitution should be established in that in- 
strument, and especially the amendment basing 
representation upon the number of legal voters. 
If they should be admitted with the basis un- 
changed, they would, with the aid of Northern 
Democrats, " at the very first election take pos- 
session of the White House and the halls of 
Congress." They might assume the Confed- 
erate debt, repudiate the Union debt, and re- 
establish slavery. He proposed to take no such 
chances while the North was the conqueror, and 
boldly proposed negro suffrage, declaring the 
doctrine that this was a " white man's govern- 
ment " to be " as atrocious as the infamous 
sentiment that damned the late chief justice to 
everlasting fame, and I fear to everlasting fire." 

On the 30th of April, 1866, Stevens reported 
to the House the important Fourteenth Amend- 
ment, for submission to the States ; and with 
a few changes in form it ultimately became a 
part of the Constitution. The report of the 
Committee on Reconstruction, although largely 
the work of Stevens, did not go so far as he 
had desired, and on the last day of the session 
he offered amendments giving the blacks an 
equal right of suffrage with the white race, and 
supported these amendments in a speech which 
was one of the most impressive ever delivered 
in the National House of Representatives. He 
was at the time worn out with the work of 
the session, his health was slender, he bore the 
burden of more than the allotted number of 
years, and very probably the fear that he might 
not be permitted to return to his seat in the 
House imparted an unusual solemnity to his 
manner and inspired him to " make one more 
perhaps an expiring effort to do some- 
thing which shall be useful to my fellowmen ; 
something to elevate and enlighten the poor, 
the oppressed, and the ignorant in this great 
crisis of human affairs." He declared that the 
black man must have the ballot or he would 
continue to be a slave. There was some alle- 
viation to the lot of a bondsman, but " a free- 
man deprived of every human right is the most 
degraded of human beings." 

" I know it is easy to protect the interests of the rich 
and powerful; but it is a great labor to guard the rights 
of the poor and down-trodden it is the eternal labor 
of Sisyphus forever to be renewed. In this, perhaps 
my final action on this great question, I can see noth- 
ing in my political course, especially in regard to hu- 
man freedom, which I could wish to have expurgated or 
changed. I believe that we must all account hereafter 
for deeds done in the body, and that political deeds will

be among those account*. I desire to take to the bar 
of that final, settlement the record which I shall this 
day make on the great question of human rights. While 
I am sure it will not make atonement for half my 
errors, I hope it will be some palliation. Are there any 
who will venture to take the list with their negative 
seal upon it, and will dare to unroll it before that stern 
Judge who is the Father of the immortal beings whom 
they have been trampling under foot, and whose souls 
they have been crushing out ? " 

As has been stated, the plan of Reconstruc- 
tion which was finally adopted conformed very 
closely to the ideas that Stevens had long and 
persistently advocated. It was promulgated 
by Congress, and not by the Executive, as he 
had never ceased to contend should be the case. 
It applied a radical dogma, which he had long 
proclaimed with the voice of one crying in the 
wilderness, and practically treated the Southern 
States as conquered provinces and as entitled 
to no rights under the Constitution. It pre- 
scribed universal suffrage for the black as well 
as for the white man, not merely in the forma- 
tion of the new State constitutions, but as an 
enduring part of those instruments. All this 
Mr. McCall well sets forth, with more of detail 
than is possible in a review like this ; and he 
concludes the subject by pointing out that the 
wisdom which passes judgment upon a situa- 
tion a third of a century afterwards has an ob- 
vious advantage over the wisdom which has to 
deal with it at the time. 

" We of to-day also lose sight of many of the diffi- 
culties with which the problem was surrounded, and 
which have disappeared in the distance. The choice which 
Stevens and the statesmen associated with him were 
compelled to make did not lie between the course actu- 
ally adopted and an ideal condition of things. In the 
light in which they acted, they were compelled to deal 
with as grave a national situation as ever existed. It 
was beyond the power of any surgery at once to deliver 
society, well and whole, from the condition in which its 
errors and crimes had placed it." 

The chapter devoted to Stevens's personal 
characteristics, particularly his wit and humor, 
is exceedingly readable. Those who knew him 
will recall other examples as good as those here 
given, for his humor was unfailing ; but his 
own personality was so large a part of what he 
said that the point must be somewhat dulled 
in the telling. 

Stevens passed away on August 11, 1868, 
and his body was buried, according to his ex- 
pressed wish, in a small cemetery where black 
as well as white were admitted, thus illustrat- 
ing in death the principles which he had advo- 
cated through a long life, the equality of man 
before his Creator. He was preeminently a 



democrat, the friend of the poor and oppressed, 
and his biographer well says that privilege 
never had a more powerful nor a more con- 
sistent foe. GEORGE W. JULIAN.*

engaged on this review of the Life of Thaddeus Stevens, and 
worked upon it during his hut few days, but leaving the task 
to be finished by another hand. Mr. Julian was a great ad- 
mirer of Stevens, and his association with him in Congress

HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH DRAMA.* 

A new edition of Dr. A. W. Ward's may- 
num. opus, " A History of English Dramatic 
Literature," is particularly welcome, for several 
reasons. In the first place, the work is beyond 
all compare the most exhaustive and important 
in our tongue in its field. And secondly, un- 
like most new editions (which are more prop- 
erly described as " impressions," being simply 
reprints of the same matter), this present issue 
contains so much in the way of rectification, 
improved arrangement, re-phrasing, and en- 
largement, that it might almost be called a new 
work upon the lines of the original study of a 
quarter of a century ago. The earlier intro- 
duction disappears, in order to allow a fuller 
treatment in the body of the study. Much 
valuable new critical material is made use of 
and the desire to throw upon the study all pos- 
sible light is everywhere apparent. When this 
monument of scholarly investigation appeared, 
in 1874, it was at once recognized as authori- 
tative, and has held the position ever since : 
this new issue serves to clinch its claim. It is 
no disparagement of the similar labors of 
scholars like Collier and (later) Fleay, to de- 
clare that Dr. Ward's survey of the native 
drama on its objective side as stage product, 
and on its subjective as literature, stands alone 
among scholarly achievements by Englishmen. 

The prime merit of the work, aside from 
thoroughness, good judgment in ample illustra- 
tion, and the deduction of sound principles 
therefrom, lies in this giving of due attention 
to the history of the stage, while at the samf 
time keeping the student to a realization of the

drama's literary splendors. The futility of 
much of the conventional older criticism has 
been the result of a disproportionate treatment 
of the product as literature alone, overlooking 
the fact that, being in play-form, it demands 
attention first of all as drama drama in its 
technique as well as in its imaginative triumphs. 
Dr. Ward interweaves the two complementary 
aspects of the study with noteworthy skill, and 
this generates a feeling of reliance upon his 
conclusions. The scope of his investigation is, 
of course, very wide. It involves tracing the 
rise of the earliest English drama from the 
altar-end of the Mother Church (with a side- 
glance at the secular influence of minstrelsy), 
its rapid development in the cruder forms of 
miracle, mystery, and morality ; its first at- 
tempts at tragedy and comedy formed on the 
classic (mostly Latin) model ; the growth of 
Shakespeare and his school ; the decadence of 
that golden product through the Stuart reigns ; 
the change to the Restoration Comedy, with its 
brilliant wit, its literary polish, and its social 
indecency, all this conducting the student to 
the epoch of Queen Anne and closing with a 
look at Steele and Addison as dramatists, 
thus stopping short of the classic late eight- 
eenth century comedy of Sheridan and Gold- 
smith. It would be a great service to the cause 
of dramatic criticism if some scholar equally 
equipped should take up the discussion here, 
tell us the story of the drama under the Georges, 
and then trace the now evident, and not unim- 
portant, revival of English-speaking drama 
within the past twenty years under such foreign 
influence as that of Ibsen and Maeterlinck. 
Enough has been accomplished already in cur- 
rent stage literature to justify such a study and 
to forecast the future in no pessimistic mood. 
Dr. Ward exhibits what I may call a sort of 
sublimated common-sense when it comes to the 
enunciation of principles. He has a literary 
perception (not to be gained necessarily by any 
amount of study) which one trusts more and 
more as one reads further. The survey of the 
scholar work done outside our own language is 
broad, showing a critic quite free from insu- 
larity. And while the manner of these illumi- 
nating essays can hardly be called brilliant, it 
is entirely free from pedantic stiffness or ob- 
scurity, and makes an impression, on the whole, 
of sober elegance. Mr. Swinburne on the elder 
dramatists, for example, gives us more sensa- 
tional reading, but is as unsafe a guide as Dr. 
Ward is a safe one. As an instance of the 
value of this contribution to the study of the 



poetic drama, take his admirable monograph 
(Vol. I., Chap. IV.) on Shakespeare, in which 
is given an account of the growth of the mas- 
ter's fame. It would be difficult, even in the 
mass of similar attempts, to indicate another 
eighty pages which tell so much so well, and are 
so little open to criticism. Dr. Ward's sense 
of proportion is happily demonstrated here by 
the half-page he devotes to a mention of the 
Baconian theory. The critical estimate of 
Shakespeare's qualities as a writer is also 
worthy of all praise for its union of perception 
and balance : the power of character-creation 
being placed above all else, and some very sen- 
sible words spoken concerning the poet's ability 
in construction, which, however much it has 
been surpassed by modern playwrights, was 
certainly vastly ahead of his time. 

In view of the amount of excellent criticism 
on the Elizabethan period which exists in En- 
glish, the treatment in the third volume of the 
later writers, and especially the Queen Anne 
writers, has particular value. This critic's 
independence and originality of thought appear 
to advantage in his closing remarks on the tail- 
end of the Stuart drama. Nothing in the whole 
course of the exposition better illustrates his 
method and habit of bringing a literary pro- 
duct into vital connection with the national 
life, thereby to explain both its merits and 
defects. It was because the plays of the Stuart 
reigns were untrue to " the higher purposes of 
the dramatic art, to the nobler tendencies of 
the national life, and to the eternal demands 
of moral law," says Dr. Ward, " that its his- 
tory is that of a decay such as no brilliancy, 
either borrowed or original, can conceal." In 
tracing the personal history of the dramatists, 
he spares no pains to sift all the evidence and 
present the reader with the probabilities ; but 
dogmatism is refreshingly absent the kind of 
theorizing which makes such criticism as that 
of Fleay so attractive that the student is in 
danger of forgetting that clever assumption, 
not fact, is before him. 

A word should be said as to the very hand- 
some and handy three-volume form which the 
publishers have given to this revision of a 
standard work, this form being an indication 
of the amount of new matter which has been 
incorporated. The dress is at once dignified 
and cheerful, and will of itself serve to win 
general readers for a work which the special 
student will need no external allurements to 
possess himself of and absorb.

[Sept. 1, 



" THRONE-MAKERS * AND OTHERS. 

The men and the nations that fight for free- 
dom and justice, as was said by Senator Hoar 
in a recent speech, are the men and the nations 
that live in the grateful memory of mankind 
not the men or nations who fight for domin- 
ion or empire. The sketches of Kossuth and 
Garibaldi, in Mr. William Roscoe Thayer's 
" Throne-Makers," will probably give greater 
pleasure to his readers than those on Bismarck 
and Napoleon III. 

The title of " throne-maker " strikes one as 
not the happiest possible to apply to Kossuth, 
the president-governor of independent Hun- 
gary : nor, for that matter, do we think of 
Garibaldi " the lifelong champion of democ- 
racy," as Mr. Thayer himself calls him as 
preeminently a king-maker. But the two 
studies are welcome under any title, that on 
the Hungarian hero the more so from the 
widely prevalent ignorance on all matters per- 
taining to Austro-Hungarian history. The 
historian Freeman has told how it was not un- 
usual for him to " come across people who 
believed that Austria was one land inhabited 
by ' Austrians ' who spoke the ' Austrian ' lan- 
guage "; and M. Louis Leger relates, in a pre- 
fatory note to the fourth edition of his history 
of Austro-Hungary, that when the municipality 
of Prague sent a set of its publications to a cer- 
tain French society, the president of the latter, 
in acknowledging the gift, expressed his regret 
at not being able to profit by the favor, owing 
to his ignorance of the Hungarian language* 

The story of Hungary's struggle for the 
restoration of her acknowledged rights will 
always be an interesting one, and certain de- 
tails in that story point a useful object lesson 
at the present time. The quarrels between the 
Hungarian generals and the civil authorities, 
the unfortunate refusal of the Magyars to grant 
to the Croats, the Serbs and the Wallachs, 
those very privileges for which they themselves 
were fighting, these and other incidents of 
the upheaval of 1848 in Hungary suggest cer- 
tain parallels in more recent history. 

Garibaldi takes the author into what is 
apparently his favorite field of study, Italian 
history. " When men look back two or three 
hundred years hence, upon the nineteenth cen- 
tury," he says in opening, " it may well be that 
they will discern its salient characteristic to 
have been, not scientific, not inventive, as we

popularly suppose, but romanti-." The very 
paradox here goes far toward convincing us, 
but when we read elsewhere in the book that 
" it is a truism that Science has advanced 
farther in our century than in all preceding 
time," we are inclined to doubt whether the 
author himself is fully persuaded that this is 
not, first and foremost, an age of material 
progress, after all. Garibaldi's autobiography 
furnishes a large part of the material for Mr. 
Thayer's sketch, and it will surprise most read- 
ers to learn how comparatively small a part of 
the Italian hero's eventful career and martial 
exploits had to do with the land of his birth 
and of his affections. 

The secret of Napoleon the Little's power is 
put in a way that is worth quoting. 

"In oar individual lives we realize the power of 
memory, suggestion, association. If we have ever yielded 
to a vice, we have felt, it may be years after, how the 
sight of the old conditions revives the old temptation. 
A glance, a sound, a smell, may be enough to conjure 
up a long series of events, whether to grieve or to tempt 
us, with more than their original intensity. So we learn 
that the safest way to escape the enticement is to avoid 
the conditions. Recent psychology has at last begun to 
measure the subtle power of suggestion. 

" But now suppose that instead of an individual a 
whole nation has had a terrific experience of succumbing 
to temptation, and that a cunning, unscrupulous man, 
aware of the force of association and reminiscence, de- 
liberately applies both to reproduce those conditions in 
which the nation first abandoned itself to excess: the 
case we have supposed is that of France and Louis 
Napoleon. Before the reality of their story the ro- 
mances of hypnotism pale." 

Apropos of Napoleon's appeal to his country- 
men's patriotism, that " last refuge of a scoun- 
drel," Mr. Thayer takes occasion to distinguish 
between glory and gloire, as follows : 

" Glory implies something essentially noble, nay in 
the Lord's Prayer it is a quality attributed to God him- 
self: but gloire suggests vanity; it is the food braggarts 
famish after. The minute men at Concord earned true 
glory; but when the United States, listening to the 
seductions of evil politicians, attacked and blasted a 
decrepit power, fivefold smaller in population, twenty- 
fold weaker in resources, they might find gloire among 
their booty, but glory, never." 

Following the " Throne-Makers " are four 
" Portraits,"-- of Carlyle, Tintoretto (or Tin- 
toret, as Mr. Thayer chooses to write it), Gior- 
dano Bruno, and Bryant. Of these the Italian 
studies show the most pains. That on Bruno, 
which is based largely on Berti's life of the 
martyr and on the minutes of the Venetian 
Inquisition, closes with perhaps not the very 
happiest attempt to point the moral of the 
story. The writer gravely assures his readers 
that " no tribunal, whether religious or political,

has a right to coerce the conscience and inmost 
thoughts of any human being"; and he adds 
the stock allusions to Torquemada and Loyola 
and Galileo, duly informing us that the latter 
was threatened with the rack for daring to 
oppose a theory of the solar system which no 
school-boy of ten could now uphold without 
being set in the corner with a fool's-cap on his 
head all of which would be most excellent in 
an undergraduate's prize essay. 

The chapter on Tintoretto in which, from 
the meagerest of materials, the man is made to 
stand before us, living and breathing, while 
from his works we are made acquainted with 
the painter merits high praise, although the 
writer's enthusiasm will be generally thought 
to have broken bounds when he pronounces this 
artist " the mightiest genius who ever honored 
painting." An eloquent plea for the preserva- 
tion of Tintoretto's fading canvasses is followed 
by a series of vivid word-pictures of his prin- 
cipal paintings. 

Mr. Thayer shows in these brief studies a 
faculty for going straight to the heart of the 
matter and for carrying his readers with him. 
The apt statement of some truth, whether new 
or old, is not infrequently met with in his pages, 
as when he says that " Bryant interprets nature 
morally, Emerson spiritually, and Shelley emo- 
tionally," and again when he calls Carlyle the 
Michael Angelo of British prose-writers. Oc- 
casionally, too, his style betrays a refreshing 
originality and picturesqueness, as in his ref- 
erence to Walt Whitman, " with cowboy gait, 
swaggering up Parnassus, shouting nicknames 
at the Muses and ready to slap Apollo on the 
back." Some of his verdicts as, for exam- 
ple, his estimate of Carlyle as " a historian 
without rival " will not pass unchallenged ; 
but they are honest opinions and ably defended. 
Most of these essays, be it said in conclusion, 
were first published in various periodicals.

THE ORIGIN OP GAMES.* 



No American student of games has done so 
much work as Mr. Culin. Beginning with 
street games of American children he passed 
to the games of the Chinese especially those 
into which the element of chance or the lot

entered. At the time of the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition at Chicago, he displayed a 
large exhibit, and printed a paper upon its clas- 
sification and bearings that was notably sug- 
gestive. Later, and in part at least from the 
influence of the Exposition, he studied the 
games of the Hermit Kingdom and prepared 
his beautiful book "Korean Games." This 
book, while chiefly devoted to Korean, made 
use also of Chinese and Japanese games for 
comparison and was the most important Amer- 
ican contribution to game study at that time. 
Mr. Culin's attention was then turned to Amer- 
ican Indian games, of which, with the aid of 
Mr. Frank Hamilton Gushing, he made a dili- 
gent investigation. Some results of this and 
preceding studies were exhibited at the Cotton 
States and International Exposition at Atlanta 
in 1885. The exhibit was considered of such 
interest and value that a gold medal was 
awarded it. 

In Mr. Culin's latest work, "Chess and 
Play ing-Cards," we have a treatise based upon 
and growing out of this collection. It fills some 
270 pages, and is amply illustrated. The atti- 
tude of the author may be best shown by a quo- 
tation : 

" The object of this collection is to illustrate the 
probable origin, significance, and development of the 
games of chess and playing-cards. Following up the 
suggestion made to the writer by Mr. Frank H. Gush- 
ing, they are both regarded as derived from the divin- 
atory use of the arrow, and as representing the two 
principal methods of arrow-divination. Incidental to 
the main subjects, various games and divinatory pro- 
cesses having a like origin, although not leading directly 
to chess or cards, are exhibited, as well as specimens of 
each class from various countries. The basis of the 
divinatory systems from which games have arisen is 
assumed to be the classification of all things according 
to the Four Directions. This method of classification 
is practically universal among primitive peoples both in 
Asia and America. In order to classify objects and 
events which did not in themselves reveal their proper 
assignment resort was had to magic. Survivals of these 
magical processes constitute our present games. . . . 
In the classification of things according to the four 
quarters we find that a numerical ratio was assumed to 
exist between the several categories. The discovery of 
this ratio was regarded as an all-important clue. The 
cubical dotted die represented one of the implements 
of magic employed for this purpose. The cubical die 
belongs, however, to a comparatively late period in the 
history of games and divination. The almost universal 
object for determining number, and thence by counting, 
place or direction, is three or more wooden staves, usu- 
ally flat on one side and rounded upon the other. Nu- 
merical counts are attributed to their several falls." 

As an example of a simple game, where moves 
along a definite track are determined by the 
fall of staves, our author cites the Korean

nyout. A game, identically the same in prin- 
ciple, is found throughout a wide range in Asia 
and America. It is represented by our Par- 
cheesl or Royal Game of India. Such games 
in Asia are usually clearly related to lot-sticks, 
or slips. These in turn are considered successors 
of ancient thrown arrows. Our author's presen- 
tation of American Indian games is most inter- 
esting. The game of plumstones is widespread. 
This is a gambling game in which dice made 
usually of fruit pits are shaken in a basket and 
the result counted. In some cases games are 
played with teeth of the beaver or woodchuck, 
which are marked : these are thrown and the 
marks showing are counted. Distinct from 
these are the staves games, with a diagram 
along which pieces are moved according to 
counts thrown. In some of these latter games 
these staves are or can be shown to be divina- 
tion arrows. One interesting fact brought out 
by Mr. Culin is that in sets of four staves, 
three are of one form while the fourth is dif- 
ferent. There is evidence, both morphological 
and linguistic, that this fourth distinctive staff 
represents the ancient arrow-throwing stick, 
while the others represent ancient arrows. 

Of course most students of games study them 
for evidence of migrations and contacts. Mr. 
Culin is cautious in making statements along 
this line. Presumably though he may be 
undergoing conversion he holds the view 
now in vogue in this country, that no such evi- 
dence is carried by them and that similarities 
are due to psychic uniformity and are inde- 
pendent growths. The psychic .uniformity ar- 
gument is just now so popular that it begins 
to look somewhat threadbare. It is suggest- 
ive that Mr. Culin finds the nyout series of 
games, abundant in Asia and America two 
areas where we should expect to find similari- 
ties on the basis of theories that antedate the 
present psychic uniformity craze. The present 
reviewer would suggest that it may be worth 
while to separate American Indians into groups 
of probably differing origins. From such a 
point of view it might be interesting to map 
the tribes, on the basis of games, into areas of 
the nyout type and the plumstone type. The 
areas would certainly overlap, but presumably 
an area would be found where the nyout type 
is absent and the plumstone game prevails. This 
area might be profitably studied in connection 
with the old-world area, where cubical dice are 
used independent of a nyout diagram. Europe, 
on the whole, appears to be such an area. Cu- 
bical dice with marked faces were there used 



in prehistoric times. The story of their origin 
from astragali, first natural and then artificial, 
has been made out: Mr. Culin restates it. 
Perhaps these suggestions will prove worthless 
in the light of increased knowledge. 

That the plays in chess were at first deter- 
mined by throws is quite certain. That Chi- 
nese and Korean playing-cards are derived 
from divination arrows and that lot-slips have 
the same origin, Mr. Culin makes clear. Our 
chess and our playing-cards have been derived 
from, or largely influenced by, the Oriental 
games. Wonder is sometimes expressed why 
cards, apparently devised for simple play, are 
used in fortune telling. The truth is the play, 
not the divination, is derived. The gypsy wo- 
men telling fates with cards is survival, not 
afterthought. 

One may see how much of curious interest 
comes out in Mr. Culm's book. Yet he has 
not printed all his important studies. He is 
working along a dozen other lines. Just as we 
write this notice, his paper on u Hawaiian 
Games " comes to hand. It aims at fair com- 
pleteness, but is entirely descriptive, going 
into neither discussion nor theory. Ninety-one 
games are described. Some are simple : others 
are quite complex. Some, like cat's-cradle, 
maika (the famous bowling game, played with 
discoidal stones upon a specially prepared 
course) and pu-he-ne-he-ne (a gambling, hiding, 
game) present particularly interesting points 
for investigation. While the treatment is 
specifically of Hawaiian games, comparative 
material is continually introduced from other 
Polynesian islands. FREDERICK STARR. 



THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE AND ITS 
REPEAL.* 



The vacancy in the United States Senate, 
caused by the resignation and subsequent 
death of Henry Clay, was filled by the election 
for the remainder of the unexpired term of 
Archibald Dixon of Kentucky. Mr. Dixon 
was a pro-slavery Whig of some local reputa- 
tion. He had been Lieutenant-Governor of his 
State, had strenuously opposed gradual eman- 
cipation in the Constitutional Convention of 
1849, and had been defeated for the governor- 
ship in the state election just passed. Illness 
compelled Mr. Dixon's absence from the Sen-

ate during the greater part of the second session 
of the Thirty-second Congress. At this session, 
a bill for the organization, without mention 
of slavery, of the territory west of Missouri, 
passed the House and failed in the Senate. 
The South would not organize that territory 
without slavery, and the North would not or- 
ganize it with slavery. At the next session of 
Congress, Douglas introduced his celebrated 
Nebraska Bill. The bill and its accompanying 
report were artfully constructed in order to 
draw Southern votes, upon the theory that the 
bill repealed the Missouri Compromise, and 
Northern ones upon the theory that it did not. 
On January 16, 1854, Mr. Dixon, either fear- 
ing the issue or preferring a straightforward 
course, gave notice of a motion to amend the 
bill by a direct repeal of the Missouri restric- 
tion, and thus forced Douglas to incorporate 
direct repeal in his bill very nearly in the form 
in which it finally passed. But for this motion, 
Mr. Dixon would never have been heard of. As 
it constitutes his only connection with Amer- 
ican history, we might not inappropriately call 
him " single motion " Dixon. 

With this motion as a climax, Mr. Dixon's 
widow has written a bulky book of over six 
hundred pages, which she calls "The True 
History of the Missouri Compromise and its 
Repeal," and dedicates it to " The Truth of 
History and the People of the United States." 
The author tells us that the work was begun 
the year after Mr. Dixon's death, in 1876 ; 
that her library and the partially completed 
manuscript were destroyed by fire in 1893, so 
that the work had to be re-written. The book 
is evidently a labor of love, undertaken as a 
memorial to her husband and completed with 
great difficulty. Under the circumstances we 
sincerely regret that we cannot commend the 
result. Mrs. Dixon possesses the qualifications 
neither for writing impartial history nor for 
making a special plea. Her material is drawn 
almost exclusively from the speeches of radical 
pro-slavery members of Congress, a study of 
which seems to have warped her judgment and 
corrupted her English. The book is encum- 
bered with long quotations from these speeches, 
many of them of slight importance, and the 
style is marred by such expressions as " defeat 
was a bitter pill " and " hypocrite of the first 
water." She treats successively the slavery 
compromises of the Constitution, the Compro- 
mises of 1820 and 1850, and the Kansas- 
Nebraska Act. In her view, the continuance 
of the slave trade until 1808 resulted from a 



bargain between the New England States on 
the one hand, and South Carolina and Georgia 
on the other, which made the North responsible 
for Southern slavery ; the Missouri Compro- 
mise was an unjust and unconstitutional act 
forced upon the South by Northern men, and 
the wrong of this act was finally redressed by 
the courage and sagacity of the " Hon. Archi- 
bald Dixon of Kentucky, true Author of the 
Repeal of the Missouri Compromise and be- 
loved husband of the writer," and these con- 
clusions are enforced by repeated assertion 
rather than by evidence and argument. 

The treatment of the Missouri Compromise 
is especially inconsistent and contradictory. 
Page after page is devoted to proof that Clay 
was not the author of the first Compromise, a 
fact now so well known that not even the tra- 
ditional schoolboy would need to be informed 
of it. Mrs. Dixon admits that slavery excluded 
free labor from the territories "as effectually as 
an act of Congress," and then denounces the 
Compromise of 1820 as working great injus- 
tice to the South by its exclusion of slave 
property. Why it was more unjust to exclude 
the Southern slave-owner by prohibiting slav- 
ery than to exclude the Northern laborer by 
admitting it, does not appear. She insists that 
the Compromise was not a Southern measure; 
though it was passed by Southern votes and 
was hailed by Southern men at the time as " a 
great triumph." She denies that the Missouri 
act was a " solemn compromise " between the 
sections, though Clay so described it ; and then 
she reproaches the North for breaking a com- 
pact by delaying the admission of Missouri. 
She seems to consider that the United States 
and Missouri were the parties to the compact, 
as if the State, in return for its admission by 
the United States, could guarantee the exclu- 
sion of slavery from territory beyond its limits. 
It is the same old chaff threshed over again. 
No amount of sophistry can make the Missouri 
act anything but a compact between the sec- 
tions. That it was not legally binding, must 
be admitted. That it was morally binding, can- 
not be gainsaid. 

The only contribution to history that Mrs. 
Dixon's book makes is contained in the few 
pages devoted to the drafting of Mr. Dixon's 
motion. Mrs. Dixon was married in October 
of 1853, and acted as her husband's amanuen- 
sis during the ensuing session of Congress. 
The value of her testimony is somewhat im- 
paired by her admission that at the time she 
understood little of what was going on, " being

in fact another edition of Dora holding the 
pens," but it is nevertheless the testimony of 
an eye-witness. Mr. Dixon dictated the motion 
to her the evening before it was introduced. 
She re-wrote it a number of times until it suited 
him, and he afterwards copied in his own hand 
the draft that he introduced in the Senate. In 
the days following the motion, Mr. Dixon's 
friends called to congratulate him upon the 
step he had taken, and Douglas took him for 
the drive, during which he accepted the prin- 
ciple of Mr. Dixon's motion and the two men 
made to each other the grandiloquent speeches, 
expressive of mutual esteem, which Dixon after- 
wards repeated in his letter to Foote. The 
important point of the narrative is that the 
motion came as a surprise to everyone, and 
that Dixon made it upon his own initiative and 
without collusion with anyone. 

It has been charged that Seward inspired 
Dixon's motion, and this charge has recently 
been given an added importance by its accept- 
ance by so prominent and able a writer upon 
American history as is Professor Burgess of Co- 
lumbia University. In a review of Mr. Rhodes 's 
history, in the " Political Science Quarterly," 
Mr. Burgess said : 

" Mr. Seward ridiculed the doctrine of popular sov- 
ereignty, and knew that the passage of the Nebraska 
bill, with its ambiguous language about the abolition of 
the Missouri Compromise by the principle of the Com- 
promise of 1850, would set the whole country on fire 
again over the subject of slavery. Yet, according to his 
own confession, he incited his Whig friend, Senator 
Dixon of Kentucky, to move the amendment to the bill 
which cleared away all ambiguity and proposed directly 
the abolition of the Compromise of 1820; and he did 
this with the purpose of destroying the quiet of his 
country, rousing the slaveholders to violent words and 
deeds, and creating an issue upon which he might be 
borne into the presidency." 

Mr. Burgess repeats this charge, though some- 
what less positively, in his admirable little 
book entitled The Middle Period." The only 
evidence upon which it rests is a statement by 
Montgomery Blair that Seward told him that 
" he was the man who put Archy Dixon up to 
moving the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, 
as an amendment to Douglas's first Kansas bill, 
and had himself forced the repeal by that 
movement, and had thus brought to life the 
Republican party." This statement was made 
in a letter written immediately after Seward's 
death, for publication in an attack upon his 
memory. If it were true, it is certainly very 
extraordinary that Seward should have made 
Blair bis sole confidant, and that no other evi- 
dence of it has ever come to light. The charge 



is antecedently improbable. Seward and Dixon 
were not friends, as is assumed ; and though 
nominally members of the same party, they 
were really as far apart politically as the poles. 
Neither of them was likely to do a service for 
or put himself in the power of the other. As 
the charge was not made until after Seward's 
death, he never had an opportunity to meet it. 
Mr. Dixon indignantly denied it as soon as it 
came to his notice, and now Mrs. Dixon, nar- 
nating as an eye-witness the circumstances 
under which the motion was drafted, contrib- 
utes her testimony in support of the conclusion 
that Mr. Dixon acted independently and with- 
out consultation with anyone. Whatever credit 
or discredit attaches to his motion belongs to 
him and to him alone. j\ j-j HODDER. 



IN AUSTRALIAN WILDS.* 

The great continent of Australia has a pecu- 
liar fascination for adventurous spirits. Its as- 
tounding dimensions about 2500 miles from 
east to west, and 1600 miles from north to 
south, containing about 3,000,000 square miles 
furnish adequate territory for explorers 
through many years to come. The last quarter 
century has seen hundreds and thousands of 
prospectors rush to the wilds of that land in 
search of gold. While a few had " a streak of 
luck," the great majority lost their all and 
many even their lives. Only a little rim around 
the coast of that new continent is occupied by 
enlightened peoples. The so-called districts of 
Australia flourish within easy reach of the sea, 
while the centre of the continent is almost one 
wild arid waste, covered with spinifex, a kind 
of desert grass, sand, and rocks, with only 
slight traces of life. 

Mr. Carnegie and a few companions landed 
in Western Australia in September, 1892, with 
their heads full of golden castles in the air. 
Into the mining regions of Coolgardie they 
plunged, eager to strike a vein of shiny metal. 
The fortunes of the early-on-the-ground pros- 
pectors drove them nearly frantic. But only 
after long searching and desperate circum- 
stances did they yield to the inevitable and

nter the employ of a company. In this capac- 
ity they found a salable mine, and wisely sold 
out. The small section of Mr. Carnegie's vol- 
ume dealing with these experiences is full of 
valuable hints and facts regarding the gold 
hunter's and miner's life in that sandy, almost 
waterless, region of Western Australia. The 
most instructive, though somewhat extended, 
portion of the book recites the daring of Mr. 
Carnegie in setting out to traverse this great 
desert from south to north a distance of one 
thousand miles in a bee line. Other explorers 
of Central Australia had met various fates : 
some had gone never to return ; others had 
started with fully equipped expeditions, and 
had barely reached civilization again. This 
adventurer chose a route of his own ; and with 
four companions, nine camels, a dog, and food 
and equipment for six months, he started in 
midwinter to penetrate the desert from south 
to north. After four and a half months of weary 
wandering over a deviating course of 1,413 
miles, he reached the northern rim of civiliza- 
tion. The most desperate want of explorers 
in this desert is water ; for days at a time, and 
sometimes even weeks, not a trace of water can 
be found, except dried-up or filthy pools in the 
hollows of rocks. But this desert is not abso- 
lutely uninhabited. The wild natives roam 
about in their solitude, living upon wild rats, 
snakes, birds, or whatever they can find. 
When the expedition had almost despaired of 
ever again finding water, a human footprint 
was found in the sand. It was followed, 
and a hundred yards ahead a wild man was 
seen digging up an iguana for his supper. He 
was caught, though only after a desperate 
struggle, and made fast by a rope. He was 
" about five feet, eight inches, thin but muscu- 
lar, with very large feet and small hands, very 
black, very dirty ; his only garment consisted 
of a band of string round his forehead, holding 
his hair back in a ragged mop-like mass. On 
his chest, raised scars ; through his nose, a hole 
ready to hold a bone or stick such was this 
child of the wilderness." He was fed on salt 
beef, with the double object of cementing friend- 
ship and promoting thirst. With the native 
leading the way, the caravan marched many 
weary hours. He often deceived them by tak- 
ing them to dry pits or dirty pools. But finding 
that he could not escape from his captors, nor 
obtain a drink of water, he led the caravan to 
an out-of-the-way place, where one could see 
merely a hole in the rocks. Climbing down 
into this recess, Mr. Carnegie discovered signs 



of water ; after lighting a fire and sliding down 
another narrow opening, he found at the bot- 
tom of it an abundant well of cool fresh water. 
The native had saved their lives, for not one 
man in a thousand could have found this hidden 
treasure. 

" From Sep. 16th t Nov. 16th we were never out of 
sight of a sand-ridge, and during that time traveled 420 
miles, taking into account all deviations consequent 
upon steering for smokes and tracking up natives, giv- 
ing an average of not quite seven miles a day, including 
stoppages. This ghastly desert is somewhat broken in 
its northern portion by the occurrence of sandstone 
tablelands, the Southesk Tablelands ; the southern part, 
. . . presents nothing to the eye but ridge upon ridge 
of sand, running with the regularity of the drills in a 
ploughed field. A vast, howling wilderness of high, 
spinifex-clad ridges of red sand, so close together that 
in a day's march we crossed from sixty to eighty ridges, 
so steep that often the camels had to crest them on their 
knees, and so barren and destitute of vegetation (sav- 
ing spinifex) that one marvels how even camels could 
pick up a living. I estimate their average vertical 
height from trough to crest at fifty to sixty feet. Some 
. . . reached a height of considerably over one hundred 
feet. Sometimes the ridges would be a quarter of a 
mile apart, and sometimes ridge succeeded ridge like 
the waves of the sea." 

The expedition's only salvation through all 
these weary marches was the frequent captivity 
of the wild natives of these trackless regions. 
Their familiarity with their roaming ground 
made them valuable to Mr. Carnegie, as they 
always knew where good water could be found. 
By December 4 Hall's Creek was reached, with 
the loss of one member of the expedition 
through an accident. After enjoying the good 
things of civilization for a time, the same com- 
pany, with a somewhat different equipment, 
plunged into the desert to return to Coolgardie, 
but by a somewhat different route. Their skill 
in capturing and controlling the natives, and 
in finding through them an abundance of water 
at frequent intervals, made this a much more 
satisfactory campaign. 

The author has prepared useful folding 
charts of the routes followed in these cam- 
paigns. They are so fully detailed as to make 
them of invaluable service to other explorers 
of these regions. Useful appendices describe 
some of the customs and weapons of the little- 
known natives, and the principal features of 
Western Australia. The whole story is told 
in direct, clear, plain English, with few pre- 
tenses of literary merit.

pecuniary support for a journey to Australia,

marsupials, and the ceratodus, a fish. This 
volume (the English edition of a work which 
first appeared in German) is a narrative, almost 
a diary, of the author's two years' experience, 
observations, and thoughts. Its style is some- 
what grandiose, and its method of telling things 
rather long drawn out and often wearisome. 
One cannot but feel that there is often a studied 
effort to say as much as can be said about 
almost every event or thing mentioned (for 
example pp. 118, 121). The translator, too, 
is often at fault in not rendering the German 
into idiomatic English, for example (p. 161), 
in speaking of the egg of echidna, the author 
is made to say, " it is very remindful of a tor- 
toise egg." 

But aside from the somewhat wearisome 
method of detail, to be seen in quotations given 
below, the book is full of genuine interest. 
This lies entirely in the facts presented, and in 
the author's masterful knowledge of his own 
specialty. Although not writing a technical 
treatise, he still describes in a popular manner 
quite a variety of the fauna of Australia. His 
experience, however, on this continent was lim- 
ited to the eastern coast of Queensland, and to 
the islands adjacent to its most northern cape, 
with a short run through the East Indies. He 
describes in one long chapter and with ample 
detail the character of the natives with whom 
he dealt. His conclusion on one point is as 
follows : 

" We find the intellect and senses of the Australian 
brilliantly developed in all directions bearing on the 
hunt, i. e., an excessively sharp power of observation, 
topographic sense and memory, and a particular fac- 
ulty of drawing conclusions from the smallest signs and 
traces, as to the whereabouts, the occupations, and the 
actual state of the game. All this, combined with great 
dexterity in the use of weapons, makes any Australian 
game the helpless prey of these perfect huntsmen. 
Therefore it is a great error to represent Australians 
as a half-starved miserable race struggling for life 
under the hardest conditions. The very contrary is the 
case." 

Mr. Carnegie, who travelled more than three 
thousand miles through the wilds of Australia, 
and had larger observation, came to quite a 
different general conclusion in his " Spinifex 
and Sand. 1 ' 

But the really valuable information con- 
tributed in Professor Semon's book lies not in its 
generalizations, but in its specific descriptions 
of local conditions and things. The habits of 
life, the character and peculiar significance of 
the Ceratodus (p. 90 Jr.), the Ornithorhyn- 
chus (p. 42/V), the Echidna (p. 157/.), and 
other less famous life of Australia, are set forth 



in a manner that will make a naturalist, for 
the time being, of any reader. The peculiar 
fauna, the topography of the islands, the lux- 
urious vegetation, the shrewd natives of the 
East Indies, are pictured with the same detail 
that we find regarding Australia. His descrip- 
tion of the Papuans of New Guinea possesses 
interest. 

" The disposition of the Papuans is light and gay. 
Solemn and grave as is the mein and deportment of the 
old gentlemen, the laughing youth forms the domineer- 
ing element in every village. The Papuan is of a de- 
cidedly domestic turn, and has much taste for the joys 
of family life. Man and wife though most of the 
men boast several spouses are generally very fond of 
each other, the women especially being much attached 
to their husbands, by whom they are in general kindly 
treated. . . . The children grow up in full freedom and 
without restraint, drilling, or bullying of any kind. 
They thus form a happy assemblage, amiable and sym- 
pathetic if somewhat boisterous, ... so pleasing in 
their boldness and freedom from restraint that it is 
impossible to be angry with them." 

Regarding the Malays of Java, he says : 

" I believe the Malays to be the cleanest of all un- 
civilized races. A warm climate in itself is by no means 
a guarantee of cleanly habits, and African negroes, 
Papuans, and, above all, the inhabitants of tropical Aus- 
tralia, show a deplorable disregard of these. . . . We 
may regard cleanliness as a national Malayan virtue." 

The greatest value of this work must be seen, 
then, in the careful observations of the author, 
the popular scientific descriptions he gives of 
men, beasts, fishes, fowls, lands, seas, jungles, 
villages, cities, governments, customs, rites, 
and everyday life as he found it in the south- 
eastern hemisphere. Four good maps aid the 
reader in following the journeys of the nat- 
uralist. IRA M. PRICE. 



AGAIN THE CASE OF CUBA.* 

Three soberly-written and thoughtful volumes, 
now before us, seem especially adapted to facilitate 
the consideration of what is now established in the 
public mind aa the Case of Cuba. The first, by 
Mr. Robert T. Hill, of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
is a well-digested and compact manual of the West 
India Islands as studied by a trained scientific ob-

server. It appears to have been prepared, chiefly, 
before the late war with Spain, with the purpose of 
presenting to the people of the United States a 
plain, unvarnished, and unprejudiced account of 
our neighbors that skirt the Caribbean waters. 

The second of these volumes, by Mr. William T. 
Clark, applies to Cuba only. Its author has inves- 
tigated the island with direct reference to its prom- 
ise as an opening for business enterprises from the 
United States. The book contains much important 
statistical information, and a pretty full gazetteer 
of the Cuban cities and towns. One who proposes 
entering Cuba for business, agricultural, mining, or 
commercial purposes will find that Mr. Clark has 
foreseen and answered many of the questions which 
would naturally arise. 

The third is by Mr. Robert P. Porter, well known 
as a publicist and as the Commissioner of the United 
States Census of 1890. Soon after the signing of 
the protocol of peace between Spain and the United 
States, August 12, 1898, Mr. Porter was sent to 
Cuba by President McKinley as a special commis- 
sioner to observe and report upon the conditions of 
the island, industrial, commercial, and financial. 
In the prosecution of his mission Mr. Porter visited 
all the provinces and most of the cities and prin- 
cipal towns of Cuba, examined many witnesses, and 
collected a vast amount of evidence, personal and 
documentary. This volume, if not his report in 
exact form as made to the President, may be ac- 
cepted as his report to the American people, deal- 
ing with the vital questions that confront the repub- 
lic as to the new life to be presently entered upon 
by this hitherto unfortunate island, once called the 
Key of the New World. The official position of 
the writer and his recognized fitness for such a 
mission, lends to his work peculiar interest as well 
as a large measure of authority. 

Questions of great moment confront the people, 
both of the United States and of Cuba, as to the 
relations which these peoples may rightfully main- 
tain towards each other, and as to the wisest methods 
by which the solution of pending questions may be 
reached. These problems must receive immediate 
consideration. It is to be hoped that passion, pre- 
judice, and greed may not be permitted to dictate 
the adjustment of interests so momentous. 

But little more than a year ago, the strained rela- 
tions between our government and that of Spain 
came to a rupture. The conflict between Spain and 
her colony had assumed the phase of a war of ex- 
termination. In a brief period, five hundred thou- 
sand human beings, men, women, and children, had 
perished, a few in fight, most of them by starvation. 
The war was pitiless in its methods and inhuman 
in its purposes against the insurgents, including in 
general all born in the island, and all occupied as 
planters, with their employees and dependants. 
Impelled by motives both of humanity and self- 
interest, the government of the United States flung 
its sword into the scale. None, whether Spaniards, 
Cubans, or Americans, in the arena of combat, or 



of the throng of European spectators who crowded 
the galleries as interested observers, doubted for a 
moment the outcome of the combat. Few supposed 
that the Spaniard would or could yield to a demand 
upon paper until the virility of the demand was 
shown by the actual clash of arms. The lightning 
strokes came swiftly, and with an intensity which 
astonished even those who manipulated the dread 
artillery. Three rounds, one in the Bay of Manila, 
one on the heights above Santiago, and one in the 
sea before its harbor, sufficed to demonstrate even 
to Spanish pride the imperative logic of superior 
force. Then followed the overture of peace, the 
protocol, the treaty, the evacuation, the transfer of 
authority, the exchange of ratifications, and under 
the proclamation of the President peace again 
reigns at least as to our relations with Spain. 

The combatants may now estimate their losses, 
count their gains, and strike a balance. The Span- 
ish Queen Regent may enter up the loss of prestige, 
the loss of fleets, and the loss of the last of her once 
imperial colonies. As to this, may we not find in 
Queen Christina another Christiana, from whose 
weary shoulders falls a most oppressive burden? 
One can imagine her, like the Apostle, having long 
prayed, " Who shall deliver me from the body of 
this death ? " Perhaps before the altar of her hu- 
miliation, the wailing music of the Miserere becomes 
transposed into the rejoicing strains of the Te Deum. 

Our venerated Uncle Sam will write in his note- 
book that he has fulfilled his promise by lifting the 
yoke from the suffering Cubans, that he has ac- 
quired a fine collection of islands, and that he has 
paid twenty millions for a white elephant still at 
large in the jungle. The actual value of the ele- 
phant as yet appears to be res non adjudicata. 

Here, as everywhere, the future treads upon the 
heels of the past. From the President to the hum- 
blest citizen, everyone is asking, What is to be done 
with Cuba? Can there be any doubt that our gov- 
ernment should, with wise deliberation, proceed to 
fulfil the promise made when Congress declared 
that " Cuba is, and of right ought to be, free " ? Is 
there any reason to doubt that events are moving 
toward that end as rapidly as the conditions will 
reasonably permit ? A most important step was the 
payment and disbanding of the Cuban army. Now 
the pressing need is the active resumption of agri- 
cultural occupations, which will signalize the actual 
return to the normal conditions of peaceful life. 

To the American mind there can be little doubt 
that the ultimate good of Cuba, to herself, will be 
found in annexation to the United States. Her 
position among the nations as a member of this 
powerful republic will be of far more importance 
than that which she could maintain as a young and 
feeble, though independent state, even if she were 
to continue to enjoy the protection of her strong 
neighbor. Entering into the republic, she would 
enjoy, as fully as do the other states, the benefits of 
home rule in all questions that concern local inter- 
ests and social life, and perhaps more fully than,

in her present stage of political education, she could 
profit by in the highest degree. At the same 
time she would participate in all the advantages 
arising from a strong national organization, with- 
out either the cost or the difficulty of establishing 
and maintaining them by herself. It is like the 
opportunity offered to a young advocate of admis- 
sion to an old, strong, and successful firm. Her 
share in the support of an army and navy, in the 
conduct of foreign affairs, the collection of revenue, 
the maintenance of a postal service, etc., would be 
far less in amount and far greater in returns if she 
were e pluribus unum than if she were doing all 
these things for herself, by herself. 

Since the close of hostilities, time has not sufficed 
for a readjustment of affairs in accordance with 
changed conditions, but some financial reliefs have 
already made themselves felt The most important 
of these is the removal of excessive Spanish exac- 
tions. The assessments of the Spanish govern- 
ment upon Cuba in the fiscal year 1895-96 were 
$24,756,760, increased by the peculations of public 
officials, estimated at ten millions more, making 
a grand total of about $35,000,000. Of this 
sum, $17,996,842 was applied to purposes deter- 
mined by dependency upon Spain, as the army, 
navy, military and civil pensions, and especially ten 
and one-half millions of interest upon the Spanish 
debt. Of the thirty-five millions exacted under 
Spanish misrule, only about seven millions, or twenty 
per cent, will survive liberation from Spanish sov- 
ereignty. The sums formerly expended for local 
government, for public improvement, for education, 
may be largely increased, as doubtless they ought 
to be, and still the exactions by government be only 
a small fraction of their former extravagance. This 
result would be certain to follow under the methods 
of United States rule. 

Moreover, the United States has been and is the 
Cuban's best customer. In 1890, Cuba's exports to 
the United States amounted roundly to $58,500,- 
000, or 88 per cent of the total for the year. Spain 
was the next best customer, taking II. 1 , per cent. 
In the five years ending June 30, 1895, Cuba's ex- 
ports to the United States amounted to nearly 
$347,000,000. These aggregates will surely be 
subject to large expansion whenever the barriers 
are removed which separate the two countries as 
foreign nations. The devices adopted by the Span- 
ish government to repress production, and by so 
doing to increase importations, and therefore rev- 
enue, strike an American singularly. In Cuba, cul- 
tivators of cocoa have paid on their product a 
revenue tax of 5.7 cents per pound ; of coffee, 5.4 
cents per pound. In Porto Rico, such agricultural 
products as maize and potatoes paid an internal 
revenue tax. Importation, which added to customs 
dues, was preferred to cultivation. 

The pledge of our nation will forbid annexation 
on any terms that do not command the sentiment 
and the suffrages of the Cubans themselves. Will 



they discern the facts and the trend of their true 
interests ? 

Should any doubt arise as to the desirability of 
the annexation of Cuba to the United States, it 
should be found among the citizens of the Union 
rather than from Cubans. The American is very 
likely to be incredulous as to the capacity of the 
Cuban for self-government. The examples shown 
by other nations of the same stock are hardly en- 
couraging. For four hundred years the islander 
has vegetated under the enervating rigiine of a 
colonial despotism. He has suffered under constant 
disabilities and ruinous exactions. What immuni- 
ties he has enjoyed he has bought secretly on terms 
as injurious to his own fine fibre as to that of him 
whom he bribed. It takes a long and patient 
schooling to educate national character, and, un- 
fortunately, the only school is that of experience, 
which allows nothing for novices. Such education 
the English colonist received during a century and 
a half before he took up the burden of a separate 
national existence. The experience was severe, but 
it stiffened his muscular fibre and developed his 
backbone ; and such an experience the Spaniard has 
not received. The English and the Spanish races 
were not cast in the same moulds, and are not likely 
to run smoothly in the same grooves. 

Americans err who imagine that there is terri- 
tory in Cuba in a condition similar to that of the 
once wild country of the great American plains, or 
that of the Pacific Coast. Uncultivated lands are 
plenty, but, technically considered, no lands are un- 
occupied. There are no land titles to be vacated, 
no lands to be surveyed and brought into market, 
to be sold by government agents to any purchasers 
who may lay down a price fixed by law. Lands 
may be bought and sold, but only as in Connecticut 
or Virginia, at the option of a present owner. 

The Cuban will be glad to deal with the Amer- 
ican, if he will stay on his own side of the water. 
He will be most happy to use American capital, if 
the American will not insist on sitting down beside 
him and sharing the management. The cry of 
Cuba for Cubans " has already arisen, and it will 
become more intense should large inroads be made 
by Americans upon Cuban territory. The carpet- 
bag will be quite as serious an offense in Cuba as 
it ever was in our own South. 

The development of Cuba is likely to benefit the 
colored race. The repulsion which exists between 
the races in the States shows itself in no compar- 
able degree in the island. The twilight zone of 
mixed blood is wide in Cuba, and the gradations 
are not clearly marked, while the lines in the South 
are becoming more sharply defined. In 1887 the 
population of Cuba was 1,631,677, of whom 485,- 
187 were of African dtwent. The present popu- 
lation is supposed to be about 1,300,000, of whom 
300,000 are of African blood. The differences 
indicate in a degree the loss of life produced by the 
system called reconcentration," which was most

severely felt by the laboring classes. These losses 
point to a loss in the supply of labor, and to a future 
demand that may draw labor from the Southern 
States. 

The commercial interests of both Cuba and the 
United States will be favored by the admission of 
Cuba into the Union ; and such interests are likely 
to prevail. The sentiment of the Cuban may pre- 
fer independence. The sentiment of a considerable 
body of the people of the States doubts the wisdom 
of bringing into the American system any country 
not educated in American political and social econ- 
omy, and dreads to have such an element as one of 
Spanish descent domiciled in the American Senate. 
Under the pledges solemnly given by our govern- 
ment to Cuba, to Spain, and to the world, the United 
States may not lay upon Cuba the mailed hand of 
the conqueror. She must be joined to the United 
States, if at all, as the result of her own choice, 

freely made.

Literary relation, M ' Joseph Texte's Jean-Jacques 

between France Rousseau and the Cosmopolitan 
and England. g pirit in Literature" (Macmillan) 
is a study of the literary relations between France 
and England during the eighteenth century. M. 
Texte has produced a decidedly acute and valuable 
essay in this rich yet comparatively unworked field 
of critical research, and in Mr. J. W. Matthews he 
has found a competent translator. Mme. De 
StaeTs observation that " There exist two entirely 
distinct literatures, that which springs from the 
South and that which springs from the North," 
would not to-day meet with that unqualified assent 
with which Frenchmen, especially, used to hail it. 
The central idea of Mme. De StaeTs theory, the 
habit of contrasting Latin with non-Latin tradition, 
Southern literature with Northern " humanism," 
remains ; but it is recognized that while Mme. De 
StaeTs distinction still holds good in substance, 
the sway of the old " classical " spirit is no longer 
supreme and undisputed in French literature, and 
it is now a question whether or no France will in 
the future preserve that veneration for antiquity to 
which the national intellect adhered for three or 
four centuries. She has for a hundred years past 
drifted in a measure from her ancient moorings 
into the current followed by the younger and more 
self-sufficing literatures. Will she return to Greece, 
to Rome, to the French classics ? Or will she turn 
to England, to Germany, to Russia, in fine, to the 
North ? The origin of the influence of the classical 
spirit upon the French genius has been fully dis- 
cussed ; that of the rival cosmopolitan spirit has 
been infrequently, and, M. Texte thinks, very 
inaccurately, dealt with. In the present work he 
endeavors to supply this want of a thorough 



and impartial inquest into the origin and bearings 
of cosmopolitanism, going back not merely, as is 
usually done, to the romantic school, but to the 
eighteenth century and to Rousseau for it was he 
who, " on behalf of the Germanic races of Europe, 
struck a blow at the time-honored supremacy of the 
Latin races." M. Texte's central aim is to exhibit 
Rousseau as the great creator of a taste and need 
in France for the literatures of the North. " The 
cosmopolitan spirit was born, during the eighteenth 
century, of the fruitful union between the English 
genius and that of Jean-Jacques." Such is the 
thesis of M. Texte's book. It is quite true, as the 
author concedes, that English influence was potent 
in France before Rousseau had begun to write. The 
revocation of the Edict of Nantes founded in England 
a colony of French propagandists in their fatherland, 
of English ideas, not alone nor most momentously in 
the field of literature. Conceive for an instant the 
normal and inevitable effect of the doctrines of 
Locke upon a keenly intelligent, profoundly discon- 
tented, and barbarously misgoverned nation, like 
the French of the eighteenth century. When the 
Grand Monarch drove that band of active-minded, 
observant Protestant subjects of his to speculative, 
freedom-loving England it was as if he had in effect 
bade them : " Go among these rebellious, free- 
thinking islanders, study their ways, taste their 
liberty, imbibe their ideas, and send the results of 
your observations and comparisons back to France 
that she, too, may understand the rationale and 
learn the lessons of the movements of 1649 and 
1688." M. Texte's appreciations of Sterne and 
Richardson are most interesting. On the whole, 
the book is one of the freshest and most stimulating 
critical studies that it has been our good fortune 
to meet with of late, and it is decidedly readable, as 
well as instructive. 

Theiooked-for Lord Charles Beresford's "The 
"Break-up" Break-Up of China" (Harper) is 
of China. substantially a printed report of the 

author's recent tour of investigation in China at the 
instance of the Associated Chambers of Commerce 
of Great Britain. It is a volume of statistics rather 
than a travel-book proper, written without literary 
pretension, and with little or no view to the mere 
entertainment of the reader. While the report deals 
chiefly with purely commercial questions, the author 
has not denied himself an occasional flight into the 
region of " high politics "; and his familiar, and we 
think substantially sound, views as to the expedi- 
ency and propriety of upholding the political and 
geographical integrity of the Chinese Empire and 
the securing therein a fair, free, and well safe- 
guarded field for trade, in the interest of all, China 
not excepted, are restated and reinforced. Lord 
Beresf ord takes a too sanguine view, apparently, of 
the not remote future possibilities of the present, 
we fear, rather ephemeral and sentimental Anglo- 
American entente cordiale. Does not Anglo-Sax- 
onism mean, after all, to the British mind something

[Sept. 1, 



very like anti-Russianism ? Is there not at the root 
of this new idea, as it floats in the mind of the av- 
erage Briton, more of apprehension than of broth- 
erly love? Then there is our "foreign vote," so 
largely and bitterly an anti-English vote, and a 
most formidable bar in the way of our government's 
accomplishing or even proposing anything however 
useful or broadly philanthropic in the way of a for- 
mal understanding with England. A Dreibund, 
uniting for certain specific commercial purposes 
America, England, and Germany, might be feasible 
certainly more feasible than anything in the 
nature of an Anglo-American alliance, against 
which our imperfectly Americanized fellow-citizens 
would at once join forces, and for whose support 
one or other of our leading political parties would 
infallibly bid. To an American these considera- 
tions may be obvious and elementary enough ; but 
our English friends seem to overlook them. Lord 
Beresford noted, manifestly to his disappointment, 
that the pretty general acquiescence in this country 
in the " Open Door " principle had not got beyond 
the stage of mere sentiment. People here applauded 
his remarks on the subject, and were very friendly 
and cordial ; but they were evidently not inclined 
to view the question of devising a definite policy 
looking to the furtherance and safe-guarding of 
American trade in China as yet within the range 
of practical politics. In Japan, on the contrary, 
there was " every indication of a desire to act in 
some practical manner in order to secure the " Open 
Door." Lord Beresford's book is a useful and 
thorough presentation of current trade conditions 
in the Chinese Empire, and it conveys a fair idea 
of what may be done and must be done if the pres- 
ent political status quo is to be usefully maintained 
as against the alternative of dismemberment and 
division into tariff-walled dependencies. The vol- 
ume is well equipped with maps and statistical 
tables, and there is a capital portrait of the author, 
showing a sturdy, sailor-like figure standing with 
legs well apart as if braced against any sudden 
twist or capriole in the roll of the ship. 

Mr. Leo Wiener's book on " Yiddish 
Literature in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury " (Scribner) deserves a welcome 
from a varied audience. Of the import of the book 
to those who themselves read or speak Yiddish, it 
is hardly necessary for us to say anything at all : 
they will perhaps appreciate its value rather more 
accurately than we. For we must confess ourselves 
ignorant of Yiddish, as are doubtless most of our 
readers. The name, of course, is not unfamiliar : 
further, the knowledge that the language is com- 
monly spoken in the Jewish colonies in our great 
cities, as well as abroad, may be fairly general. 
But any real appreciation of Yiddish literature, or 
even acquaintance with k, is rare among general 
readers. Yet it appears from Mr. Wiener's his- 
torical sketch, and from the extracts which make 
up a good part of his book, that there is much that 



Themyiifry 
that it called 



is worth knowing about Those who have been 
interested in social problems have long been in the 
habit of considering the Jewish element among us : 
they will find in the account of this literature much 
that should make this curious social fraction better 
understood. There are also those for whom the 
Jewish strain in literature and art has a special 
charm the strain of Spinoza, Heine, Disraeli, to 
speak of literature only ; and these will be glad to 
see what is the work in letters of the Jews who 
remain Jews, how far it has the quality and the 
spirit of those great men who seem to have out- 
stepped the boundaries of the chosen people. But 
further, and more particularly, there are many now 
who are eagerly on the lookout for a new literature. 
Think how many exotic sensations we have had in 
the last decade Bulgarian, Persian, Polish, "Afro- 
American," Scandinavian, Russian, not to speak of 
the four more common polite languages. These 
tastes of the literature of peoples very different 
from ourselves have a peculiar quality. This Yid- 
dish has a pathetic charm, a quaint delicacy which 
is very rare, although it may not perhaps precisely 
belong to it The very strangeness, the half -mystery, 
stimulates the imagination and gives a peculiar 
beauty which may vanish as one learns the language 
better, leaving in its place a sounder appreciation. 
Mr. Wiener gives a sketch of the history of the 
literature in the present century, sometimes rather 
dry on account of having to deal with commonplace 
material, sometimes most attractive and really crit- 
ical, as especially in his handling of Perez and 
Abramowitsch. From the examples of Yiddish with 
English translations it appears that the language is 
( naturally ) not very difficult to the reader of Ger- 
man, though it cannot be very easy to learn well 
without more help. Mr. Wiener says that if the 
present work arouses interest he will undertake a 
more complete Chrestomathy : we think many be- 
sides ourselves would welcome such a book. We 
may add, for the benefit of those whose interest in 
Jewish literature is aroused by Mr. Wiener's book, 
that a short history is just published in " Chapters 
on Jewish Literature " by Israel Abrahams (Jewish 
Publication Society). In short compass and in a 
popular way the author considers the literature of 
the Jewish people from the fall of Jerusalem till 
the time of Moses Mendelssohn, about the period 
at which Mr. Wiener's book begins. 

It is now some years since accounts 
appeared in the papers of the remark- 
able case concerning Mr. Whistler's 
" Brown and Gold : Portrait of Lady E.," and we 
have now Mr. Whistler's presentation of the mat- 
ter. " The Baronet and the Butterfly : A Valen- 
tine with a Verdict" (Russell) is a very curious 
work, not so clever as " The Gentle Art of Making 
Enemies " (for there is not so much really by Mr. 
Whistler himself) but still very suggestive. It is 
not worth while to recall to mind the facts in the 
case : Sir William Eden wanted damages and got

them, while Mr. Whistler wished " to expose pub- 
licly the ungrateful trickster," and did so. Nor do 
we attach very great importance to the alleged es- 
tablishment of certain advances in the sacred cause 
of Art against the Philistines. Our interest in the 
book comes largely from the light, or rather dark- 
ness, that it throws on the character of Mr. Whistler. 
Whether Sir William Eden deserves all the names 
he is here called, is not a matter to disturb us, and 
the sacred cause of Art does not seem to call for 
special championship at this moment ; but the genius 
of Mr. Whistler is something worth knowing as 
thoroughly as we can. So far as his power as a 
painter is concerned, it is now by very many greatly 
appreciated. But here comes the curious question : 
How can a man whose mood as a painter has so 
much of exquisiteness, of reserve, of dignity, of 
power (not to mention peculiarly artistic qualities), 
how can such a man conceive the nervously clever 
quips and the labored pettinesses that we see in Mr. 
Whistler's letters and comments? This has always 
appeared very strange to us. We have often found 
it hard to sympathize with Mr. Whistler in the 
fundamental right of his position, because of the 
eccentric temper in which he maintains it. We do 
not want to hold a ridiculous and conventional 
opinion of what the character of an artist should 
be, but we are jarred by such incongruity of ex- 
pression in a man whose work has such a claim 
upon one as Mr. Whistler's has. Is it only through 
the chance of time that we do not have evidence of 
the same thing in his friend Velasquez? Or is it 
that our time has really developed genius to " a 
disease of the nerves " ? Perhaps rather the last. 
Somebody, we believe, suggests that Mr. Whistler 
the artist can only exist by virtue of the purging 
ebullitions of Mr. Whistler the humorist. It may 
be so. We have nothing better to suggest : we can 
merely look forward with interest to a sympathetic 
life of Mr. Whistler by somebody else. 

Miss Rose G. Kingsley's " A History 
of French Art : 1100-1899 " (Long- 
^^ mans) is a concise, authoritative 

manual prepared for the use of those in quest of 
solid information, and therefore issued without the 
popular bait of pictorial allurements. The sober 
and solid make-up of this handsomely printed vol- 
ume does not belie its content. The author is 
officier de ^instruction publique, and the work was 
prepared at the instance and with the assistance of 
M. Antonin Barthele'my. Other well known French 
authorities have also aided in its preparation, and 
we have as a result a really sound and trustworthy 
account of the growth of French architecture, sculp- 
ture, and painting from the 12th century to the 
present day. The author has been somewhat chary, 
judiciously so perhaps, in the matter of obtruding 
her own views and personality, though the element 
of general criticism or disquisition is not altogether 
lacking. Actual information and impartial charac- 
terization has been the ideal of attainment ; and the

result is a guide to the history, development, and 
manifestations of French art during the extended 
period treated, which we cordially recommend to 
serious inquirers. A useful modicum of biographical 
and personal matter forms an agreeable leaven, and 
characteristic masterpieces are soberly and discrim- 
inatingly described. The work, despite its wide 
chronological range, is far from being a mere cata- 
logue raisonnS. The author gives a very good ac- 
count of ''Impressionism," which movement, she 
takes occasion to say, " has too often signified the 
daubings of some young person ignorant of the very 
first principles of drawing or painting, who dares to 
call himself an ' Impressionist ' because he is too 
lazy or impatient to submit to the ceaseless training 
and study that are necessary to the artist ; too igno- 
rant to use his brush or his pencil, and takes to a 
palette-knife instead. It is such as these who bring 
discredit on the really fine artists whom they pre- 
tend to admire." These are just words, if severe 
ones ; and it is really a pity that the affectations 
and absurdities of these young daubers who cloak 
their incapacity and their ignorance of the rudiments 
of technique under the pretense of "Impressionism," 
should have brought a certain stigma upon the term 
that is used to define the methods of masters like 
Monet, Besnard, Manet, or Renoir. 

"Lady Louisa Stuart: Selections 
Some *pngMiy from hep Manuscripts" (Harper) is 

old-lime gossip. .11 i r tt . 

a sprightly volume of old-time gossip, 
edited by the Hon. James Home. Lady Stuart was 
a daughter of John, third Earl of Bute, one of 
George Third's Prime Ministers ; and the picture 
she paints of some of the personages prominent at 
the court of that monarch are racy, amusing, and 
at times slightly malicious especially where the 
sitter chances to be of the writer's own pex. Lady 
Stuart was born in 1757, and died in 1851. Her 
tastes were literary, and she had the knack of ex- 
pression ; but she was deterred from publishing by 
the fact that it was then thought beneath the dig- 
nity of people " of quality " to appear in print, like 
common Grub Street bodies. Tempora moresque 
mutantur. Nowadays " the quality " not only writes 
for print, but eke publishes ; and had Lady Stuart 
lived to-day she might, without forfeiture of caste, 
have joined the craft of Johnson to that of Cave. 
The story of the descensus of the British Aristocracy 
from the pinnacle of patronship to the depths of 
authorship might be worth writing. One regrets 
that Lady Stuart could not have foreseen the day 
(now with us) when a great lady could, with the 
applause of her order, issue a magazine, and angle, 
through the advertiser's arts, for the shillings of the 
public in support of her venture. Once, indeed, 
Lady Stuart did appear formally in print, over her 
own patrician signature to wit, in an Introduction 
to a life of her grandmother, Lady Mary Wortley 
Montagu, some share of whose ability she seems to 
us to have inherited. In fine, Lady Stuart's me- 
moir is crisp and entertaining, and not without value

in the way of portraiture. An element of interest 
is the author's correspondence with Sir Walter 
Scott, Lady Montagu, and Lady Lockhart. There 
is a portrait of Lady Stuart at ninety-four, after an 
oil sketch by Hayter. 



neat little volume forming the 
Second Series of Mr. Francis Watt's 



Lane) differs from its predecessor in that its con- 
tents are of more general interest, and are treated 
with greater fulness of detail and in a style more 
suited to the entertainment of the lay reader. The 
contents comprise seven brief papers which serve to 
illustrate the old English law and its ways, and 
incidentally to make the reader feel how much bet- 
ter these matters are ordered nowadays how much 
more rationally, humanely, and scientifically. Gro- 
tesqueness and barbarity, the principle of the ven- 
geance of society on the criminal (rather than the 
preventive theory), so amply and shockingly in- 
stanced in Mr. New's pages, have pretty thoroughly 
departed from English law. Gone are the days 
when executions were public (and terribly fre- 
quent) spectacles to which people flocked as to the 
Lord Mayor's Show, and which bred " amateurs of 
executions," connoisseurs who never missed a hang- 
ing and who paid well for a choice window or bal- 
cony fronting Tyburn Tree, like Boswell and George 
Selwyn the latter of whom, when he had a tooth 
drawn, used affectedly " to let fall his handkerchief 
<i la Tyburn, as a signal for the operation." Mr. 
Watt's present titles are : Tyburn Tree ; Pillory and 
Cart's Tail ; State Trials for Witchcraft ; A Pair 
of Parricides ; Some Disused Roads to Matrimony ; 
The Border Law ; The Sergeant-at-Law. Mr. Watt 
has evidently delved deep in the mine of obsolete 
law and by-gone legal procedure and execution, and 
he. has produced a book which lawyers may read 
with profit, and laymen with interest. 



Memoir* of 

i toUlifr 



The special value of the " Memoirs of 
Sergeant Bourgogne: 1812-1813" 
** Napoiton. (Doubleday & McClure Co.) lies in 
the fact that they tell the story of Napoleon's Rus- 
sian campaign from the point of view of the com- 
mon soldier. M. de Se*gur has given us the narrative 
of the staff officer ; in Bourgogne's pages we read 
the coarser and more harrowing side of the story. 
Seldom have the horrors of war been depicted by a 
more literal and unaffected pen. In no previous 
record, we think, of this mad enterprise has the 
utter demoralization of the invading army, its grad- 
ual dissolution into a broken and fleeing horde of 
disorganized stragglers, been so impressively real- 
ized. Bourgogne's personal adventures, while 
plainly and artlessly told, were most dramatic. The 
editor, M. Paul Cottin, provides an interesting 
sketch of the author, and there are a number of 
illustrations after drawings made by an officer dur- 
ing the retreat. The memoir forms a historical 
document of no slight value. 



8*m* Count* Anything that will serve to awaken 
m.int,t <md in the existing generation of Amer- 
icans a recognition of national tradi- 
tions and manners is to be welcomed at a time when 
we bid fair to throw our most highly cherished 
ideals to the fates. Quite apart from this, such an 
undertaking as is launched in the first volume of 
Some Colonial Mansions and Those Who Lived 
in Them " (Henry T. Coates & Co.), edited by Mr. 
Thomas Glenn Allen, deserves high praise. A large 
octavo, well bound, carefully printed and admirably 
illustrated, it keeps alive the memory of some of 
the families of the early day whose members exerted 
no small influence on all subsequent American life. 
Such names as Harrison, Stockton, Van Rensselaer, 
Carter, Randolph, Livingston, and Carroll, among 
others not now so well known, bring to mind the 
diverse elements which were fused together to make 
up the idea of America, and cannot fail of a useful 
purpose. Nearly all of the colonies outside of New 
England have been drawn upon, and the book 
abounds in pictures of houses and their interiors, of 
family portraits, and of many other things which 
recall a living past. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



An English translation of Maupassant's " Boule de 
Sui f," the work of Mr. Arthur Symons, is published by 
Mr. William Heinemann of London in a beautiful vol- 
ume, printed upon Japanese vellum, and illustrated with 
more than fifty wood-engravings from drawings by 
M. F. The*venot. Mr. Symons also writes a few intro- 
ductory pages. "Boule de Suifisone of the most 
artistic short stories ever written, and suffers at the 
hands of the translator no more than is absolutely un- 
avoidable. It is not exactly a story for the young per- 
son, but this warning need hardly be sounded for those 
who are likely to be attracted by the present notice. 

The versatile Mr. Grant Allen has been recently en- 
gaged, among other occupations, in the preparation 
of a series of historical guides to the chief European 
cities and countries. As a sort of complement to these 
manuals he has also prepared an outline volume entitled 
"The European Tour" (Dodd), which we heartily rec- 
ommend to travellers (whether for a year or a month) 
because it provides them with a rational plan of seeing 
Europe, and gaining the right sort of culture from their 
wanderings. Mr. Allen is so breezy a writer that his 
companionship upon such a trip is of the pleasantest 
sort, and bis advice (although touched by a dah of 
Philistinism) is generally judicious and worth taking. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers have collected into a 
single handsome volume the poems of Mr. William Allen 
Butler, who is best known as the author of " Nothing 
to Wear." This poem was published without a signa- 
ture in one of the early numbers of " Harper's Weekly," 
in 1857, and speedily became popular. Mr. Butler's 
verses, to which this authorized final form has just been 
given, include " Oberannnergau " and other travel 
pieces, some poems for children, and a number of trans- 
lations from Uhlaud. The volume is dedicated to the 
writer's wife, " in the fiftieth year of our wedded life."

LiITERARY NOTES. 



An " Introduction to Rhetoric," by Dr. William B. 
Cairns, is one of Messrs. Ginn & Co.'s latest publications. 

Mr. Swinburne is about to break a long silence with 
the publication of a new drama, entitled "Rosamund," 
which is promised for the early autumn. 

" The Princess " of Tennyson, edited by Mr. Lewis 
Worthington Smith, is an English text for school use 
just published by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. 

The American Book Co. issue a volume of selections 
from the Brothers Goncourt, edited by Dr. Arnold 
Guyot Cameron, and authorized by the literary executor 
of the writers concerned. 

" Saints in Art " (Page), by Mrs. Clara Erskine 
Clement, is a readable book of the popular sort, sup- 
plied with many illustrations, and making no historical 
or critical pretensions of a serious nature. 

The latest of Sir Edwin Arnold's exercises in trans- 
lation from the classics of the East is the " Gulistan " 
of Sadi. The first four " Babs " or " Gateways " of this 
famous work have just been published for the transla- 
tor by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

The "Cuore" of Signor de Amicis, called "The 
Heart of a Boy," in Mr. G. Mantellini's translation, has 
been reissued by Messrs. Laird and Lee in an attractive 
illustrated edition, designed for use as a holiday gift or 
a school prize. It is a book to be warmly commended 
to young people, who can hardly fail to be the better 
for having read it. 

Rembrandt is the subject of the latest volume in the 
series of " Monographs on Artists," written by Professor 
H. Knackfuss and published by Messrs. Lemcke & 
Buechner. The translation, as in the two previous vol- 
umes of the series, is by Mr. Campbell Dodgson of the 
British Museum. The illustrations are profuse and 
carefully executed. 

The most interesting publication yet put forth by the 
" Brothers of the Book" (Gouverneur, N. Y.) is a re- 
print of Robert Louis Stevenson's essay on " The Mor- 
ality of the Profession of Letters," first published in 
the " Fortnightly Review " for April, 1881. The present 
reprint is issued in a limited edition on handmade paper, 
carefully printed, and neatly bound in buckram. 

Mr. Augustus Thomas's new American play, "Ari- 
zona," now being presented in Chicago at the Grand 
Opera House, is in the hands of the printer, and will 
soon be issued by Mr. R. H. Russell in book form, illus- 
trated by twelve pictures from the play, and with a 
striking cover design by Mr. Frederic Remington. The 
same publisher announces the " Maude Adams Edition," 
of " Romeo and Juliet." The book will be illustrated 
and attractively bound. 

The second year's work of the University of Chicago 
College for Teachers, and also that of the Class Study 
Department of the University Extension Division, will 
open at the College for Teachers, the office of which is 
in room 410 Fine Arts Building, 203-207 Michigan 
boulevard, on Saturday, September 30. Classes will 
meet also in Cobb Hall at the University, and at the 
Newberry Library. The opening exercises of the College 
for Teachers and the Class Study Department will be 
held in connection with the Autumn Convocation of the 
University at Central Music Hall, on Monday evening, 
October 2. Bishop J. L. Spalding, of Peoria, will de- 
liver the address, his subject being The University and 
the Teacher."

beyond the reach of any except the most favored students. " Journal of Education.

eating matters are presented with minuteness of detail." The Dial (Chicago).

workmanship. The machine-head is hinged, so that it 
can be folded down below the table against a bent- wood 
shield that fully protects the dress of the operator and 
the floor from all droppings of oil, lint, etc. By this 
device the machine is thoroughly protected from dust, 
and the stand forms an ornamental and useful table 
that is fitting and appropriate to any home. The hinged 
extension-leaf covering the machine when down is folded 
back when it is raised, thus making a table- top measur- 
ing 40 inches in length by 16 in width, affording ample 
room for the work.

SCRIBNER'S NEW FALL BOOKS. 



RICHARD HARDING DAVIS'S NEW BOOK. 



THE LION AND THE? UNICORN. 

With six illustrations by H. C. Chr;7</ 12mo, $1.25. 

In this volume Mr. Davis makes it plain that since the publics*^,' of his last book of stories three years 
ago his knowledge of human nature has deepened and broadened in the same proportion that his work as a 
literary artist has acquired exquisite finish and precision. The volume contains, in addition to the title story, 
"On the Fever Ship," " The Man With One Talent," "The Vagrant," and " The Last Ride Together. " 



DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES. 
By E. W. Hornung. 12mo, $1 25. 

A thrilling story of adventure. The London Spec- 
tator describes it as " A modern story of piracy on 
the high seas and of romantic rivalry. Rattray, the 
wicked but fascinating suitor, reminds us not a little 
of Raffles, the unscrupulous but engaging hero of Mr. 
Hornnng's last story, ' The Amateur Cracksman.' " 



THE YARN OF THE BUCKO MATE. 

His Adventures in Two Oceans. 12mo, $1.50. 

By Herbert E. Hamblen. 

This new romance by the author of " On Many 
Seas " is as racy and entertaining a narrative as Mr. 
Hamblen has ever written. It is the story of a sailor 
whose adventures on the Atlantic, in Peru and Chili, 
and in search of a treasure on an island in the Pacific, 
make a fascinating tale. 



THE POWERS AT PLAY. 

By Bliss Perry. 12mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Bliss Perry's short stories have a peculiar freshness and flavor which comes of a thoroughly whole- 
some view of life presented with all the literary skill and charm that are too often put at the service of 
pessimism. His stories show a certain sympathy and mellow humor, the quality of which Mr. Perry almost 
monopolizes among our younger writers. 



THE WHITE MAIL. 
By Cy Warman. 12mo, $1.25. 
A lively and adventurous story by a writer who 
knows the reality and feels the romance of the rail- 
road as does no one else. Mr. Warman has here 
adequately described, in his familiar manner, the 
varied and inevitably picturesque career of the youth 
who begins at the very bottom and rises to the top of 
the railway ladder. 

WILD ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN. 
By Ernest Seton Thompson. 

Illustrated. 20th thousand. Square 12mo, $2.00. 
"There is nothing in modern story-telling which 
equals the tale of the capture of the pacing mustang. 
. . . In depicting animal life and character, Mr. 
Thompson has probably no peer in this country, and 
this delightful volume shows us that his pen is as 
mighty as his marvellous brush." New York Mail 
and Express. 



SAND AND CACTUS. 
By Wolcott LeClear Beard. 12mo, $1.50. 
A collection of stories which have given their author 
unique distinction as the interpreter of life and char- 
acter among the frontier conditions of Arizona and 
the extreme Southwest. They include, with others, 
" Bisnago's Madeline," " Tizzard's Castle," " Liver's 
Responsibility," " The Martyrdom of John the Bap- 
tist," and, in a humorous vein, " Rouge et Noir." 

THE FUGITIVE. 

A Tale of Adventure in the days of Clipper Ships and Slavers. 

By John R. Spears. 

Illustrated by Waller Russell. 12mo, $1.25. 
A stirring boy's story, following the adventures of 
the hero from his country home in Vermont through 
his experiences at sea, on the coast of Africa, and 
finally on a slaver from which he escapes. It is full 
of adventure, and gives an accurate picture of life at 
sea in the old days.

The pages of this volume are replete with reminiscence and reveal the quaint and picturesque town of the

NO CHANGE IN SIZE OR QUALITY 

FROM its first introduction to the American public HARPER'S 
MAGAZINE has steadily grown in popular favor and appre- 
ciation. Received at first with spontaneous acclamation, it has 
for half a century retained its primacy in the household regard 
and in the public esteem. In the largest sense it has been repre- 
sentative of the best literature and of the best art of its time. 
With the December number it will enter upon its hundredth 
volume in circumstances so auspicious as to give it an exceptional 
advantage. In its fifty years of existence it has witnessed many 
changes in the arts of illustrating and printing, and it has ever 
been a pioneer in adopting every new contrivance for beautifying 
its pages. During all these years improvements in machinery 
and processes have been such as to reduce the cost of manufac- 
ture to the point where the publishers are at length enabled to 
make a corresponding reduction to their readers, and while the 
price hereafter will be only twenty-five cents per copy, they take 
this opportunity to announce not only that the character of the 
MAGAZINE will be maintained at its present high standard, but 
also that every effort will be made to make it more attractive.

bis five-year-old mistress. He is stolen, and nearly

THE DUTCH AND QUAKER COLONIES IN AMERICA. 

By JOHN FISKB. With 8 Maps. Two vols. Crown 8vo, gilt top, S4.00. 

This is a work of first-rate importance, probably the most distinctive contribution of this year to American 
historical literature. It comes next in order to Mr. Fiske's " Beginnings of New England." It traces the causes 
which led to the colonizing of New York by the Dutch, and Pennsylvania by the Quakers; it describes the small 
beginnings, the formidable obstacles, the tenacious purpose, and the gradual growth of these colonies to great 
power. The very interesting story is told with the remarkable clearness and charm which make Mr. Fiske's 
volumes of American history as delightful as they are important.

Threshold," " The Freedom of Faith," etc. With

to public attention. Dr. Bushnell was for years one of the brightest

JOHN MURRAY FORBES. 

Edited by his daughter, SARAH F. HUGHES. With

This work is one of the most notable which the year will bring in 
the Department of biography. Mr. Forbes was a man of remarkable 
force and quality of character, a sagacious leader among business men, 
of an ideal public spirit, and a prince among philanthropists. Mr. 
Emerson, who knew him Intimately, held Mr. Forbes to be an Ameri- 
can of the noblest type. The work comprises letters to and by Mr. 
Forbes, and autobiographic chapters highly interesting for their views 
of public men and events, and for their comments on the questions of 
most importance in bis time. His acquaintance with leading Americans 
was very extensive, and his personal allusions are of remarkable interest.

TERS OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON

letters to a friend not known to us. The elevated tone of thought, the 
kindliness of judgment, and the felicitous form of expression, give to 
i an uncommon attraction.

College. 16mo, 81.25.

maadiac doctrine* of religions life and thought in forms that appeal to 
th* experience of men to-day. Ood is our teacher, and all men belong to

cation, its method, Its purpose, iu successes and seeming failures all 
are treated with much acuteness of thought and in a vigorous style.

it and meet dream fairies; Aaron takes them to see an old fox, Scar- 
Face ; Cawky, the crow, Mr. Coon, and Flit, the flying squirrel, relate 
their biographies, and the book tells a great deal more, just as inter- 
esting as Mr. Harris's stories always are. It is bountifully illustrated. 

THE HELPERS. 

By FRANCIS LTNDE, author of "A Romance in Tran- 
sit." 12mo, 81 50. 

This Is a story of the New West of to-day. It deals with engineers, 
silver and gold mining, and love finds easy entrance. There is an un- 
commonly strong human interest in the story ; the hero and heroine 
are so real as to seem actual living persons ; the dialogues and descrip- 
tions are peculiarly good ; and, in short, it Is a very enjoyable tale, 
effectively told.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS 



Oom Paul's People. 

By HOWARD C. HILLEOAS. With illustrations. 
12mo. cloth, 81 50. 

"Oon Paol'a Poople" U the title of an exoMdingly timely 
and intr*ating book, praaentlufi clearly for UM first time in thia 
country the Boera' aide of the Tranavaal Question. The author is 
Howard C. Hillegu, a New Tork newspaper man, who spent nearly 
two years In South Africa, enjoying special facill'iea at the hands of 
Preetdeat Knifrer and other Boer officials, as well aa from Sir Alfred 
Milner and other British represenutlres at Cape Colony. The book 
contains an important interview with Oom Paul, and a special study 
of Cecil Rhodes. The author blames stock jobbers and politicians for 
all the trouble between the Boera and the English, and believes that 
war U the probable final outcome One chapter is especially devoted 
to the American interests in South Africa, showing that, while 
British capital owns the vast gold mines, American brains operate 
them. The book la eminently readable from first to last. 

Averages. 

A Novel. By ELEANOR STUART, author of 
" Stonppastures." 12mo, cloth, 81.50. 
Novels of New Tork have sometimes failed through lack of knowl- 
edge of the theme, but the brilliant author of ' Averages" and 
" Btonepastures " baa bad every opportunity to know her New Tork 
well. She has been able, therefore, to avoid the extremes of " hUh 
life" and "low life," which have seemed to many to constitute the 
only salient phases of New Tork, and she paints men and women of 
every day, and sketches the curious interdependence and associa- 
tion or impingement of differing circles In New Tork. It is a story 
of social life, but of a life exhibiting ambitions and efforts, whether 
wisely or ill directed, which are quite outside of purely social func- 
tions. There is a suggestion of the adventurer, a figure not unfamiliar 
to New Yorkers, and there are glimpees of professional life and 
the existence of idlers. "Averages" 1s not a story of froth or 
alums, but a brilliant study of actualities, and its publication will 
attract increased attention to the rare talent of the author.

Richard Carvel 



110th Thousand 
15th Edition 
Cloth, $1.50 



100,000 IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS 



"RICHARD CARVEL 
one of the most dtlightful and 
fatcinating studies of man- 
ners and stories of adventure 
which has yet appeared in 
onr literature." HAMILTON 
W. MABIB in The Outlook. 



" A third satisfaction to be derived from a reading of this 
book lies in the conviction that first dawns upon the reader's 
mind, and then grows in force and positiveness as he proceed* 
with the story, that we have in this new writer one who has 
studied his art and, to an extraordinary degree, mastered it. 
. . . Asawhole.it is a production of which not only the author, 
but his countrymen, have every reaion to be proud. "Literature. 



"RICHARD CARVEL.. . 

is in every way strong, orig- 
inal, and delightful . . . en- 
titled to high place on the list 
of successful novels. ... It 
is a charming story." Buf- 
falo Commercial. 



" RICHARD CARVEL is a historical romance of revolutionary days, with the scenes laid partly in Maryland and partly 
in the London of Qeorge III. In breadth of canvas, massing of dramatic effect, depth of feeling, and rare wholesonieneaa of 
spirit, it has seldom if ever been surpassed by an American romance. ... It is one of the novels that are not made for 
a day." Chicago Tribune. 



" RICHARD CARVEL seems, verily, to potieti every qual- 
ity that goes to make a genuinely great work of fiction. It baa 
the reassuring solidity and the charming quaintness of ' Henry 
Esmond ' or ' The Virginians,' with an additional zest that 
must perforce be the author's own." New York Home 
Journal. 



" RICHARD CARVEL is the most extensive piece of 
semi-historical fiction which has yet come from an 
American hand ; it is on a larger scale than any of iu prede- 
cessors, and the skill with which the materials have been 
handled justifies the largeness of the plan." H. W. M. in 
The New York Time*.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 1899. 



A NEW HISTORICAL NOVEL 

Just Published by THE BOWEN- MERRILL COMPANY: 

THE BLACK WOLF'S BREED. A Story of France in the Old World 
and the New; Happening in the Reign of Louis XIV. By HARRIS DICKSON. 
Illustrations by C. M. RELYEA. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $1.50. 

This tale of adventure, by a new Southern writer, seems destined to rank high among the successes of the 
year. It is stirringly told, is full of a sort of interest which endures from beginning to the end, and the 
writer has the grip of experience in relating dashing incidents, an experience which he has gained by the most 
careful research into the history of the days of his story, and by personal jonrneyings to those parts of France 
and of America with which the story deals. 

RILEY LOVE LYRICS. With pictures by DYER. Being a collection of tin 
favorites of James Whitcomb Riley's poetry, illustrated with over fifty studies 
from life by WILLIAM B. DYER. 12mo, ornamented cloth, $1.25. 

" < Riley Love Lyrics ' is one of the most beautiful of the holiday books. It contains all the favorites of 
his dainty, tender love poems, and the illustrations, of which there are over one hundred, add greatly to the 
book's artistic beauty. Mr. Dyer shows a poetic appreciation of the author's verse and the ability to work out 
with camera and brush the central ideas in an altogether delightful way." 

THE LEGIONARIES. By HENRY SCOTT CLARK. A story of the great raid 
made by General Morgan in the Civil War. Illustrated by HOWARD McCoR- 
MACK. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $1.50. 

The book is in a field that is new and it gives a series of accurate, vivid, yet dispassionate pictures of the 
time. The description of the dashing ride made by the famous raider is dramatic in its interest. 

BOOK LOVERS' VERSE. Songs of Books and Bookmen. .Compiled from 
English and American authors. By HOWARD S. RUDDY. 12mo, gilt top, $1.25. 

THE PURITAN REPUBLIC. By DANIEL WAIT HOWE. A History of tin-

LITERARY NOTES . 193 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

The classified list of forthcoming publica- 
tions, which is, as in previous years, the dis- 
tinctive feature of this mid-September issue of 
THE DIAL, excites so many pleasurable antici- 
pations that the most careful selection from 
the announcements made can hardly fail to be 
somewhat invidious. As is stated in the note 
which heads the list, there are upwards of six- 
teen hundred titles already at hand, which is 
not only an increase, but a notably large in- 
crease, over any list previously published by 
us. Out of this wilderness of books of all 
sorts of interest we select, with considerable 
hesitation, a few of those that seem most at- 
tractive, confining the selection mainly to the 
departments of general literature, belles-lettres, 
history, and biography, although a few books 
from other categories are also included. 

Among works of general literature we are 
particularly glad to notice that the "American 
Anthology," upon which Mr. Stedman has for 
several years been engaged, is at last about to 
appear. Colonel T. W. Higginson will pub- 
lish a volume of reminiscences under the title 
of " Contemporaries." Professor C. E. Norton 
has edited a new volume of the correspondence 
of Ralph Waldo Emerson. A volume of the 
prose of E. R. Sill will prove a welcome com- 
panion to the three volumes of his verse already 
published. A volume of the letters of Sidney 
Lanier will be an extremely acceptable addi- 
tion to the list of the writings of a man 
whose fame grows yearly more secure. " The 
Authority of Criticism and Other Essays," 
by Professor W. P. Trent, will, we are sure, 
find many appreciative readers. Volumes of 
essays by Professor John Fiske and Professor 
H. T. Peck, those exceptionally versatile wri- 
ters, are also to appear. There will be sev- 
eral volumes in the new series of " National 
Studies in American Letters," edited by Pro- 
fessor G. E. Woodberry, whose own contribu- 
tion, " Flower of Essex," will be awaited quite 
as eagerly as any of the others. We are glad, 
too, that an enlarged issue is promised of the 
selected essays of the late Richard Malcolm 
Johnston. 

Outside of American general literature, 



164 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



the most promising announcements are those 
of the letters of Robert Louis Stevenson and 
the long-heralded memoirs of Victor Hugo. 
Mr. Gosse's Life and Letters of John Donne 
has been heralded even longer, and will be 
one of the " books of the year. " The " Rus- 
sian Literature" by Mr. K. Waliszewski will 
be added to Mr. Gosse's series of " Literature 
of the World." Dr. Richard Garnett's Es- 
says in Librariauship and Bibliography " will 
appeal to all bookmen. The host of reprints 
and artistic new editions of standard litera- 
ture is so great that we hesitate to select from 
them, but must make a single exception in 
favor of Mr. Mosher's list, which is quite as 
attractive as ever, and includes sixteen titles, 
among them Mr. Swinburne's first series of 
" Poems and Balads, " his " Under the Micro- 
scope," Mr. Mat-kail's translation of the 
"Georgics," Rossetti's " Hand and Soul," and 
Stevenson's "A Child's Garden of Verses." 

Among the important biographies of the 
year will be Mr. Marion Crawford's life of 
the Pope, the two-volume life of John Everett 
Millais, Mr. L. R. Hartley's life of Francis 
Lieber, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe's " Reminis- 
cences," Prince Kropotkin's autobiography 
more fascinating than nine novels out of 
ten, as readers of " The Atlantic Monthly " 
already know, a life of Charles Sumner by 
Mr. MODI lie Id Story, Mrs. John Drew's rem- 
iniscences, Mr. Frederick Bancroft's life of 
William II. Seward, President Gilman's life 
of James D. Dana, Mr. Paul L. Ford's " The 
Many-Sided Franklin," and Mr. John Sar- 
tain's " Reminiscences of a Very Old Man." 
The various biographical series are going 
merrily along, and one or two promising new 
ones are projected. 

The literature of American History will be 
notably enriched by new volumes of such 
standard works as those of Professor McM as- 
ter, Professor John Fiske, Mr. James Scbouler, 
and Mr. J. F. Rhodes. A political history of 
" The United Kingdom," by Professor Gold- 
win Smith, is sure to be at once weighty and 
readable. A new field of description is en- 
tered upon by Dr. Lyman P. Powell, who has 
edited an important work upon the " Historic 
Towns of the Middle States." The edition of 
Monroe's writings will be continued, and an 
edition started of the writings of Madison, the 
latter edited by Mr. Gaillard Hunt. 

The most interesting announcements of 
poetry are of volumes by Mrs. Louise Chandler 
Moulton, Miss Louise Imogen Guiney, and 



Professor G. E. Woodberry. But poets seem 
to be few in number this year, or else unusually 
modest in putting forth an advance claim to 
attention. We find no American announce- 
ment of Mr. Swinburne's u Rosamund," but 
that work will, of course, be the " book of the 
year" as far as poetry is concerned. We have 
also seen reports in our English exchange 
a probable volume of miscellaneous poems by 
Mr. Swinburne, as well as of the tragedy defi- 
nitely promised. 

We may well pause for breath before at- 
tempting to select, even for this briefest of men- 
tion, a score or more of the novels that seem 
to promise the most satisfaction. In American 
fiction we note the following: "Janice Mere- 
dith," by Mr. Paul L. Ford ; " Via Crucis," 
by Mr. Marion Crawford ; " To Have and to 
Hold," by Miss Mary Johnston ; " Their Silver 
Wedding Journey," by Mr. W. D. Howells : 
"The Last Rebel," by Mr. Joseph Altsheler; 
and new volumes of short stories by Mr. Bret 
Harte, Mr. Richard Harding Davis, and the 
late Blanche Willis Howard. In English fic- 
tion we are to have " The King's Mirror," by 
"Anthony Hope"; "The Orange Girl," by 
Sir Walter Besant ; "Siren City," by " Benja- 
min Swift"; "lone March," by Mr. S. K. 
Crockett ; " Stalky & Co.," by Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling ; "The Ship of Stars," by Mr. A. T. 
Quiller-Couch ; "A White Dove," by Mr. W. 
J. Locke; and "Heronford," by Mr. S. R. 
Keightley. We suppose that " Maarten Maar- 
tens" may be considered sufficiently English 
to warrant the mention of " Some Women I 
Have Known " in this list. In translations of 
Continental fiction, six works of the first im- 
portance may be underscored. They are the 
" Knights of the Cross," by Mr. Sienkiewicz ; 
" Resurrection," by Count Tolstoy; " Fruitful- 
ness," by M. Zola ; " The White Terror," by 
M. Felix Gras; "The Poor Plutocrats," by 
Mr. Jokai ; and " Saragossa," by Sf nor Galdos. 
These are new works, with the exception of 
Mr. Jokai's romance, which has long been a 
Hungarian classic. 

Returning now to works of scholarship, we 
find space to mention only a few of the more 
promising announcements. Mr. Edward Fitz- 
gerald's "The Highest Andes" and Mr. Charles 
Neuf eld's "A Prisoner of the Khaleefa" are 
perhaps the most important works of travel 
and adventure. Among works of art, we note 
a great work on Rubens, by M. Emile Michel, 
an "Iconografia Dantesca," by Herr L. Volk- 
mann, and a new series of "Handbooks of the 



1899.]

Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture," 
edited by Mr. G. C. Williamson. In science 
one important announcement is that of "Ap- 
pletons' Geographical Series," edited by Mr. 
J. H. Mackinder, and another is the " Cyclo- 
pedia of American Horticulture," edited by 
Mr. L. H. Bailey. Finally, among works of 
social science we are promised "Democracy 
and Empire," by Professor F. H. Giddings, 
"The Distribution of Wealth," by Professor 
John B.Clark, " The Principles of Taxation," 
by the late D. A. Wells, and the third and 
concluding volume of Professor Palgrave's 
" Dictionary of Political Economy," which has 
been greatly desired for several years. 



LITERATURE, MUSIC, AND MORALS. 

The ever-enduring discussion as to whether a 
book may picture evil, may paint scenes and char- 
acters not usually brought to the notice of women 
and children, and the somewhat similar battles over 
dancing Bacchantes and nude French art, raise a 
question as to why music is so seldom involved in such 
controversies. "Why is it that literature is by some 
regarded as a regular Upas plant, and a circulating 
library in a town as " an evergreen tree of diabol- 
ical knowledge," while music is suffered to go on 
its way serenely without any indictment for crim- 
inal conversation or corrupting ways? 

At first blush, the art which has the most power- 
ful momentary effect on our passions and emotions, 
which is used to incite men to martial ardor or sub- 
due them to sensuous reverie, which in its simplest 
and most popular forms the Soldier's March in 
Faust, or a Strauss waltz is as effective as in the 
heroic Symphony of Beethoven or the Nocturnes 
of Chopin, at first sight, it would seem that such 
an art could be most easily misused and most read- 
ily accused of wrong-doing. But such is not the case. 
Nobody except a Nietsche or a Tolstoi has ever 
accused any form of music divorced from words or 
action of being immoral. The young girl all over 
the world is not only allowed but encouraged and 
compelled to busy herself with music, which, if it 
expresses anything, must express things dangerous 
as well as things innocent. At the same time, the 
forbidden fruit of the knowledge of literature is 
carefully kept from her or selected for her. Why 
this difference? 

It is against the principles of a true American to 
go to a German philosopher for an explanation of 
anything, but perhaps Schopenhauer's metaphysic 
and theory of art will help us here. In brief, this 
is how he decides matters : The primal thing, the 
origin of all, is the Will the Will to live. This 
Will arranges itself into many grades, similar to the 
Platonic Ideas, which are the types and genera of 



existing realities. These ideas again objectify 
themselves simultaneously in the world of particu- 
lars and individuals, which is the object, and in the 
knowing mind, which is the subject. The majority 
of human beings can only realize themselves and 
the outward world of sense and perception. The 
genius in the sphere of literature and the fine arts 
generally does more than this. He rises to a knowl- 
edge of the architypal ideas, and sees the universal 
in the particular ; and he is able to make the rest 
of mankind dimly sympathize with him. The mu- 
sician, however, cannot do this. For him, neither 
the world of sense perception nor that of the prim- 
itive Ideas exists. He does not imitate the first, 
as other artists do, nor does he arrange his forms 
according to the grades and divisions of the last. 
The primal Will speaks through him directly, and 
every human being in whom the Will exists in its 
unity and totality feels and understands him with- 
out being able to reason about or explain the mat- 
ter. It follows that the poet who has to deal with 
the world of sense, in which there is as much evil as 
good, as much night as day, must, if he give his 
world correctly, indulge largely in the shadows of 
existence ; while the musician, freed from such 
world, only gives us the primal impulse of life, which 
we do not consciously disintegrate into good or bad. 

This is very flattering to the writer of music. 
Artists are envious, and the exquisite footing of the 
first act of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme mildly typ- 
ifies the cat-and-dog aversion which the members of 
the various liberal arts have for each other. Nor 
are the leading arts of expression the only ones that 
quarrel for precedence. The ancients elevated per- 
fumes almost to the level of poetry, and M. Alcide 
de Mirobolant wooed his love with symbolic sauces 
and confections, and considered himself a gentle- 
man and an artist. In short, it is doubtful if Scho- 
penhauer's theory will be widely accepted. 

For one thing, he calls music the universal lan- 
guage. If it be, it is a language which has not yet 
found its Ollendorf. The musical theorist of to-day 
decides, for example, that Greek music was non- 
existent. Yet this race, certainly not a stupid one, 
evidently thought they had attained to complete 
musical expression. Their literature is full of ref- 
erences to the art, and a great number of their 
deities were dedicated to the protection and per- 
formance of it. They unquestionably had a varied 
assortment of musical instruments, though not so 
many as their predecessors, the Egyptians. Whole 
orchestras are depicted on the Egyptian tombs, yet 
the modern musician will probably deny their knowl- 
edge of music. Again, Chinese music exists and 
gives pleasure to a large part of the human race, 
yet to our ears it seems barbarous dissonance. But 
the quarrel of European musicians among them- 
selves the battle of Wagnerites and anti-Wag- 
nerites is sufficient to plant in the ordinary mind 
a doubt of Schopenhauer's theory as to music being 
the immediate and direct utterance of the universal 



166 



TIIK DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



Will. Schopenhauer himself says that where music 
is fitted to action or words, these should be subor- 
dinated to it ; which is the direct contrary of Wag- 
ner's theory and practice of interpreting actions by 
music. 

If there exists a universal language, it is a simpler 
one than music it is the language of gesture and 
human motion : in other words, the dance. This 
is, and always has been, practiced and understood. 
If a man is shipwrecked on a desert island, and 
comes into company of its savage and possibly can- 
nibal inhabitants, how does he go about to make 
himself understood ? Does he troll a stave or sing 
a long recitative with the leit-motif dedicated to 
hunger reappearing at intervals? No. He kneels 
down in token of submission makes motions with 
his hands to his mouth and stomach to show his 
needs: and if he is received and regaled treated 
not as a meat but as a guest he probably skips 
about in a lively manner to indicate pleasure and 
gratitude. It is curious to remark that Dante's 
Paradise the farthest reach of the human imag- 
ination in picturing the unknown is a soundless 
world. There are no harps or citherns or orchestras 
there. There is nothing but light, dancing, and 
philosophical discourses. Critics there have been 
who thought it grotesque ; and unquestionably the 
spectacle of grave Doctors of the Church gyrating 
on one toe, or wheeling three times about Dante 
and his guide, or flocking together like cranes and 
writing out symbolical letters on the sky, might 
make a thoughtless reader smile. But philosoph- 
ically speaking, Dante was quite right. 

If we sub>titute motion for Will as the primal 
thing which, as Schopenhauer refuses to explain 
the cause of Will and even denies that it has any 
cause, is a legitimate thing to do we get a some- 
what different relation of the arts to life. Three of 
the fine arts dancing, music, and poetry are 
founded on motion. For sound is probably only an 
accident of music, its real essence is the differ- 
ently measured and related waves of motion. Bee- 
thoven was deaf, but that did not interfere with his 
creative power, nor, presumably, with his enjoyment 
of music. Architecture is the reverse of motion 
it expresses rest, static immobility, and is best ex- 
emplified in Egyptian and Greek buildings. Gothic 
architecture is an attempt to revolt from the law of 
the art, and to express, by means of the heaviest 
materials in nature, aspiration and upward flight. 
It is as if a sculptor should carve a statue of Gravi- 
tation and give it wings. Sculpture is the arrest of 
motion. Painting is at its best when it gives the 
vitality of life, and the scene or figure grows and 
acts before one. Dancing is motion with forms 
added. Poetry is motion with forms and ideas 
added. Music is motion without either forms or 
ideas pureunembodied motion. Whether this last 
method of expression is superior to poetry, which 
gives in its characters and ideas the whole of the 
world of sense and in its rhythm the whole of the 



world of Will, everybody will decide according to 
previous predilection. 

Roughly speaking, I should say that poetry is an 
aristocratic and music a democratic art. It requires 
intellect to appreciate the one ; while emotion, pas- 
sion, the Will-to-live, suffice for the enjoyment of 
the other. Like the Darwinian science, Schopen- 
hauer's philosophy dethrones the conscious intellect 
and substitutes the blind and spontaneous forces of 
nature. Yet no one has more loudly and continu- 
ously celebrated intellect. He is like a man whose 
head is twisted on his shoulders and who marches 
in one direction while his gaze is mournfully fixed 
another way. 

The essential and cherubic innocence of music 
comes out in this exposition. It has no relation to 
morals, for things are good or bad as we attach 
ideas to them. Its world is a world of pure impulse, 
impetus, and agitation. There can be bad music, of 
course, music hackneyed, or which does not con- 
form to the laws of the art. But it must be diffi- 
cult for true music to be base or vulgar. It is 
understood that many of the most popular strains 
of comic opera have been taken almost bodily from 
old church music ; and the reverse is possible. The 
stormiest and most passionate music, then, music, 
which, for aught we know, may be the utterance of 
the soul of one of the damned, can be given to a 
young girl to interpret without danger of its con- 
taminating her. 

But how does poetry stand in this respect? It 
has in its rhythm, though of course less peifectly 
than music, the essence of motion, pure, unembodied, 
and divine. But it is compelled to give also motion 
which is embodied in nature motion beautiful, 
life-giving, turbulent, desolating, and destroying. 
It has to give the same motion as it is repeated in 
the mind of man happy, serene, disturbed, wrath- 
ful, death-dealing. Nay, as the desolating elements 
and forms of nature fire, storm, earthquake 
are the most startling and instantaneous, as the bad 
motives and actions of men yield themselves most 
readily to effect and climax, so literature chooses to 
deal largely with evil. For it loves energy mo- 
tion in its intensest forms. It would be actionable 
if a newspaper were to give in plain prose the plots 
of many of the greatest masterpieces of literary art. 
Dr. Quincey did something like this drew up a 
resumS of Goethe's " Wilhelm Meister " and the 
bare facts were ludicrous and immoral enough. 
But the book does not seem ludicrous and immoral 
when we yield ourselves to its energy and its flow. 
Cardinal Newman, in his book on The Idea of a 
University," came to this cross-roads. He *aw that 
the profane literature of the world, and particularly 
that of the ancients, dealt overwhelmingly with evil. 
Was it, therefore, to be taught to the Htudents of a 
Catholic university ? He decided that it must : that 
it could not hurt anyone to read in a book what he 
must know if he takes a stroll on the HtreeU or lis- 
tens to the gossip of a club. Human nature is robust

enough not to be shocked at itself. And human 
nature translated into the terms of good literature 
given, that is, for the sake of the energy and 
power of which it is capable, and not to pander to 
base thoughts, ought not to shock anyone ; but on 
the contrary, especially when it adds to the rhythm 
of poetry that unexplainable motion sprung we 
know not whence it ought to charm the tedium of 
life and leave us greater and better than we were.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE CIVIL WAR AND NATIONAL 

SOVEREIGNTY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The review of the work by Mr. Egan and myself on 
" The Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution," 
which Mr. James O. Pierce contributed to the mid- 
August number of your paper, is in many ways grati- 
fying ; but I would like, if I can, to correct the 
impression that " the authors advocate the theory that 
the United States did not become a Nation until made 
so by the results of the Civil War." 

The Federal Constitution is essentially national in 
character, and nowhere does it show this character 
more strongly than in the Commerce Clause itself. 
Time aud experience of the new government were re- 
quired, however, to complete the work of making a 
Nation in fact of that which the Constitution had made 
a Nation in law. 

In Chisholm v. Georgia, decided in 1793, the case to 
which Mr. Pierce refers, five judges rendered individ- 
ual opinions. No opinion was rendered on behalf of 
the court, but expressions were used which indicated 
that a majority of the justices considered that the Fed- 
eral government was national in character. The case 
was, however, followed in 1799 by the Virginia and 
Kentucky resolutions announcing views of the Consti- 
tution which are absolutely inconsistent with any actual 
national sovereignty, and which nevertheless have the 
support of the great names of Madison and Jefferson. 
In 1823 the doctrine which was afterwards known by 
the name of " Nullification " was presented to Mr. 
Justice Johnson, and subsequently, in 1824, was elab- 
orately argued before the Supreme Court in the case of 
Gibbons v. Ogden. In both cases the element of na- 
tionality involved was, as we have noticed in our book, 
explicitly disclosed and asserted by the Federal Courts 
(" Commerce Clause," page 16 ; ) but in 1832, eight 
years later, " Nullification " was still growing and in 
that year produced the famous Ordinance of South 
Carolina. It was the doctrine of State's Rights which 
enabled Southern states to exclude free persons of 
color ; which in 1836 compelled the Postmaster Gen- 
eral of the United States, upon the demand of State 
officials, to exclude anti-slavery publications from the 
mails ; which produced the dissensions in the Supreme 
Court in New York v. Miln (1837) the License Cases 
(1847), and the Passenger Cases (1848) ; and which 
drew from Mr. Justice Barbour and Mr. Justice Grier 
the statement that the police power reserved to the 
States is itself " complete, unqualified, and exclusive," 
so that State regulations enacted under this power are 
superior to Federal statutes in authority. 



It is clear, therefore, that during the time when 
Southern influence was as strong at Washington and 
upon the bench of the Supreme Court as it was for 
many years before the war, the Southern theories of 
construction had succeeded in depriving the Federal 
government of many national attributes. The influ- 
ence of the doctrine of State's Rights, as we say in our 
work, " may be seen throughout the course of decisions 
of the Supreme Court before the Civil War, and al- 
though it had the distinct disapproval of that court, it 
was a doctrine which no decision could overthrow." 
( " Commerce Clause," page 37). The war did not 
change the Constitution, but gave it for the first time 
full operation. It is in this respect that the " issue of 
the Civil War finally established on a new basis the re- 
lations between the States and the Federal govern- 
ment." Whatever their legal relations had been before 
the war, they were certainly not established in fact as 
they were afterward. The decision in Craudall v. Ne- 
vada established, in 1867, the right of free movement 
between all points within the national boundary ; but 
a greater change could hardly have been made, for 
until then no such right had in fact existed. The 
right to go from Massachusetts to South Carolina, until 
the Civil War altered matters, depended in fact not 
upon Federal law but upon State law, that is, in these 
matters there seemed to be no national boundary, for 
the citizen of the United States knew only State bound- 
aries. 

After the subject of slavery first arose " like an 
alarm bell in the night," until the war disposed of se- 
cession, theories of disunion greatly influenced consti- 
tutional construction. State sovereignty was more 
thought of than national sovereignty. The government 
which began with the Constitution was not completely 
established as a national government until these ques- 
tions which dated from its commencement were at last 
settled, until the government which had so often been 
called national was given again the national powers of 
self-administration which had been taken from it, and 
the national theory of construction had been at last 
adopted by the whole people.

"BALDOON" AND "DAVID HARUM." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As the publishers of Mr. Le Roy Hooker's new book, 
" Baldoon," we think it desirable to correct an impres- 
sion, shared by a number of reviewers, that the work 
must have been written in imitation of Mr. Westcott's 
" David Harum." 

Singularly enough, the first accusation came from a 
newspaper published in Mr. Hooker's home city, the 
Chicago " Times-Herald." Under the conspicuous head- 
line, " David Harum Imitated," that paper said in part: 
" Such remarkable success has attended the publication 
of ' David Harum,' that it is but natural for other au- 
thors to attempt to do something in the same line. . . . 
The reader [of ' Baldoon 'J feels all the time as if the 
author is saying to himself, ' David Harum succeeded 
because it was a wonderful character sketch. Perhaps 
if I do full justice to all these peculiar people I have 
in mind I may catch the public with one of them.'" 

This was followed by a Detroit paper, which began 
its review with the remark, " It was inevitable that we 
should have a story reminiscent of David Harum," and 
added, " It [Baldoon] suggests David Harum only be-

cause one of the characters is an apostle of the homely 
philosophy of honest dealing and candor of speech." 

These and other direct accusations, and insinuations 
to the same effect, are extremely unjust to Mr. Hooker, 
and tend to hinder the success of a work upon which he 
bestowed long and conscientious labor. It is proper, 
therefore, for us to say that Mr. Hooker's novel was 
completed nearly two years before " David Harum " 
was published, nnd the MS. was in our possession nearly 
a year before the appearance of that work. This will, 
we trust, be conclusive as to the falsity of the injurious 
charges, and as to the originality of a work which, in 
our judgment, has no need to climb to popularity on 
even the broad shoulders of " David Harum."

BISMARCK'S DEBT TO GOETHE. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

The August number of the Deutsche Rundschau con- 
tains a characteristic article on Goethe by Professor 
Herman Grimm, son of one of the authors of the great 
Grimm Dictionary and son-in-law of Bettina von Arnim, 
who played a more or less important role in Goethe's 
life in Weimar. As showing Professor Grimm's opinion 
of Goethe's services to the German language, and of 
Bismarck's debt to him, the following extract, trans- 
lated from this article, has a special interest in this 
year of Goethe celebrations: 

" The German of Goethe will be the language of the 
new German Empire, just as the language of Homer 
was that of the Greek world, of which the Iliad and the 
Odyssey were the fir.st monuments, and the Gospel of 
John the last. How far the dominion of Goethe's 
language may eventually extend, nobody knows. The 
first successor of Goethe is Bismarck as writer of his 
own life, a work that may he called the first German 
work of art written in the language of Goethe without 
showing a trace of imitation. Just as Goethe's 'Her- 
mann nnd Dorothea ' would not have been possible 
without Homer, so Bismarck's ' Reminiscences and 
Reflections' (Erinnerungen und Gedanken) would not 
be imaginable without Goethe. Goethe created for 
Germany the atmosphere in which alone this fruit 
ripened." CHARLES BUNDY WILSON.

MR. W. M. GRISWOLD, who died last month in 
Maine, his native State, at the age of forty-six, will be 
remembered gratefully by literary workers for his 
useful bibliographical work, which he prosecuted chiefly 
aider the queer pseudonym of "Q. P. Index." His 
series of indexes include the " North American Re- 
Tiew," "The Nation," " Lippincott's Magazine," the 
elder " Scnbner," the " Eclectic," " Harper's Weekly," 
some British and some German historical magazines, 
essays, etc., and a series of " Q. P. Annuals." His 
Descriptive Lists of Novels were also valuable. He 
was a man of eccentricities, and these marred some- 
what the mechanical form of his publications, and may 
partly explain why he was always his own publisher. 
Mr. Griswold was a graduate of Harvard in 1875. 
He was the son of the better known Rufua W. Gris- 
wold, whose attacks upon Poe in his " Poets and Poetry 
of America" have occasioned no little controversy ; 
and bis last work, published about a year ago, was a 
sort of vindication of his father from criticisms which 
this controversy entailed.

"AMERICAN TAL.K8" BY 

VETERAN.* 

Few critics, we fancy, are likely even in 
this time of the cult of the newest and latest, 
when the idol of the day before yesterday finds 
himself not uncommonly the despised " back 
number " of to-day to hint that that im- 
memorial veteran of American letters, " Ik 
Marvel," lags superfluous on the stage upon 
which he made his debut over half a cen- 
tury ago. " Ik Marvel " is a trusty perennial 
whose recurrent blossoming gladdens the sea- 
son. The second volume of " American Talks " 
from the pen of this unflagging entertainer is 
replete with pleasant and informing chat of 
Emerson, Poe, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Lowell, 
Holmes, Whittier, Alcott, Tboreau, Ripley, 
Willis, Fuller-Ossoli, and some lesser contem- 
porary lights, that are now dimmed or alto- 
gether quenched, save in the memory of the 
living remnant of the generation that knew 
them in the season of their effulgence. Is there 
anybody nowadays that knows anything of, for 
instance, David Hosack, R. II. Wilde, C. F. 
Hoffman, Thomas Smith Grimke, John San- 
derson ? all considerable writers, if we are 
to credit our author, which we implicitly do. 
Then there are the Abbotts, John S. C. and 
Jacob. Everybody knows (vaguely) of the 
Abbotts, of course. But does anybody read 
them ? Is the most " general " reader nowa- 
days guileless enough to dip into the rose-water 
histories of John ? or is there any living hu- 
man boy (to quote "Mr. Chadband ") who 
could stand the " Rollo " and " Jonas " of the 
prolific Jacob, or who could not " give points" 
on worldly matters to that superior person and 
exacting parent, " Mr. Holiday " ? Across 
Mr. Mitchell's page flits, too, the shade of Mrs. 
Sigourney. It is long since we have seen men- 
tion of Mrs. Sigourney. 

Mr. Mitchell, as we have said, is a veteran, 
perhaps the veteran, of American letters. His 
first book was published in 1847 ; his latest, 
not his last, as we have reason in his preface 
to infer, now lies before us, warm from the 
press, quickened with alert and unflagging sym- 
pathy with men and books, a little shaded with 
a certain wistful, half-diffident regret for the 
worthies and standards of Ion<r a<n>, hut written

in a vein of intrinsic grace and charm that even 
the most " contemporaneous "-minded of the 
generation whose spokesman is Kipling may 
well relish. Not that " Ik Marvel " has kept 
pace with the changing fashion of style (what 
a far cry it is in this regard from, for example, 
N. P. Willis to the author of " Plain Tales 
from the Hills"!), or that he has, out of def- 
erence to the mode, divested his thought of 
the somewhat dandified garb in vogue at the 
period to which he looks back. He is still 
" Ik Marvel," as the following passage, an ex- 
treme example, of course, may serve to indicate. 
" There are descriptions of Parisian dinners in his 
{John Sanderson's) ' American in Paris ' which fairly 
scintillate with provocatives of appetite and with con- 
stellations of cookery; all the more tempting was his talk 
of Apician delicacies, since it was broidered and savored 
by abounding Latinity and by pungent Roman flavors 
swirling down on classic tides from the days of Lucnllus." 

Mr. Mitchell writes interestingly of Emer- 
son, and thus discerningly points out the source 
of the insufficiency, as biography, of Holmes's 
pleasant Life of the Concord sage: 

"... A lithe and witty Montaigne cannot meas- 
ure for us a broad-shouldered Plato ; he is too much 
and too buoyantly himself to write the life of another. 
Scarce does the pleasant doctor begin his delightful 
task, but his own piquant flavors, queries, and humor 
bubble up through all the chinks of the story and make 
us forget the subject in the narrator. A man who is 
so used to drawing attention to his own end of the table, 
cannot serve safely as a pointer at someone else." 

Of Emerson's " aloofness " Mr. Mitchell goes on 
to say, apropos of the Rev. Henry James's com- 
plaint of " his prim and bloodless friendship ": 
". . . But James with the warmth of the New 
Jerusalem ' in him craved sympathetic speech in those 
who talked theologies with him a most acute, eager 
man with transcendental ranges of thought. The estimate 
agrees with that of many; few could get near Emer- 
son; the Marchioness Ossoli never; Hawthorne never; 
James never ; an implacable acquiescence closes the 
doors between him and very many earnest talkers. . . 
About the weather, or his neighbor's pigs, or Thoreau's 
bean-patch, he could warm ; but if one dropped such 
topics for talk about the soul, or immortality, he froze; 
on such trail his thought was too intense for any bat- 
tledore and shuttlecock ' interchange of phrase." 

Not so Alcott, who, on the slightest hint 
from his unwary interlocutor as to the " soul, 
or immortality," would go on, like Tennyson's 
brook, forever or at least till the dazed dis- 
ciple or victim broke away and fled, leaving 
the button in the grasp of the still expounding 
oracle. Emerson, it is true, spoke of Bronson 
Alcott as " a most extraordinary man, and the 
highest genius of his time." But does Mr. 
Mitchell remember the story of the window, 
at the rear of the Emerson house, which the 



artless cicerone of the place used not long 
ago to point out to visitors as "the one 
through which Mr. Emerson used to escape 
when he saw Mr. Alcott coming down the 
garden path? " We suspect not ; for he tells 
us, without reservation : 

" The sobrieties and the large dignities in which 
the Orphic philosopher wrapped even his shallowest 
speech, could not be otherwise than agreeable to the 
man [Emerson] who had a horror of noise and bounce." 

The " Orphic Sayings " (would they find 
lodgment in a magazine nowadays?) con- 
tributed to " The Dial " in Miss Fuller's time, 
Mr. Mitchell makes bold to say were " rather 
mystical than profound," and " most charac- 
teristic " of the author. 

" He delighted in forays into regions of the unknown 
with whatever timid or tentative steps and although 
he might have put a vehemence into his expression that 
would seem to imply that he was drifting into deep 
waters one cannot forbear the conviction that 't would 
be easy for this man of the explorative mentalities to 
touch ground with his feet (if he chose) in all the 
bays where he swims." 

Does Mr. Mitchell mean to hint that the 
fathomless Alcott, " the highest genius of 
his time," deliberately feigned to swim where 
he might, had he chosen to be honest, have 
waded ankle-deep ? An accurate colloquial 
version of one of the " Orphic Sayings " might, 
then, prove in a way instructive. We remember 
a young acquaintance of ours once saying that 
a sentence of Emerson's resembles a sentence 
of Alcott's as an apple resembles a puff-ball. 

Mr. Mitchell talks interestingly of the Brook 
Farm experiment, and has some kind words 
for the earnest and high-minded " Archon " of 
the little community, George Ripley. Ripley, 
it is interesting to know, was not altogether 
pleased with the " Blithedale Romance." 

" Much as he enjoyed the genius of Hawthorne, I 
do not think he had kindly thought of the Blithedale 
Romance'; not, indeed, blind to its extraordinary merit, 
or counting it an ugly picture but as one throwing a 
quasi pagan glamour over a holy undertaking. I re- 
member once asking him in that dingy Tribune office 
after the religious tendencies, or utterances of Haw- 
thorne in those Brook Farm days; he said, bluntly 
'There were none no reverence in his nature.' Very 
likely he would have hesitated before putting such 
opinions in cold type. But I could see that old mem- 
ories were seething in his thought, of that large humane 
purpose into which he had put his heart, and whereon 
the great Romancer had put only his artist eye." 

Of the "great Romancer," Mr. Mitchell 
draws the following winning portrait : 

"Mr. Hawthorne was then (1853) nearing fifty 
strong, erect, broad-shouldered, alert his abundant 
hair touched with gray, his features all cast in Greek 
mould and his fine eyes full of searchingness, and yet

of kindliness; his voice deep, with weighty resounding 
quality, as if bearing echoes of things unspoken; no 
arrogance, no assurance even, but rather there hung 
about his manner and his speech a cloud of self-distrust, 
of mal-aise, as if he were on the defensive in respect of 
his own quietudes, and determined not to rest there. 
Withal, it was a winning shyness; and when some- 
what later his jolly friend Ticknor tapped him on the 
shoulder, and told him bow some lad wanted to be pre- 
sented, there was something painful in the abashed 
manner with which the famous author awaited a school- 
boy's homage cringing under such contact with con- 
ventional usage as a school-girl might." 

Mr. Mitchell's chapter on Poe amounts al- 
most, as with several other of the more con- 
siderable authors in his list, to a brief biograph- 
ical sketch. A foot-note on Foe's biographers 
briefly summarizes Mr. Mitchell's estimates of 
their several accounts. 

" Biographies: by Griswold, harsh in its judgments; 
Ingram, full, but over-defensive; Stoddard, wholly fair, 
not extended; Woodbury, faithful, painstaking, cleverly 
done, but not wholly sympathetic; the late Professor 
Minto's sketch (British Encyclopaedia), very misleading; 
and Lang's note in his piquant ' Letters to Dead Au- 
thors,' has kindred misjudgments." 

While dealing charitably and with becoming 
reticence with Foe's failings as a man, Mr. 
Mitchell says : 

" Whether by pre-natal influences or forces of educa- 
tion, the moral sense was never very strong in the poet ; 
nor was there in him any harrassing sense of the want 
of such a sense. He used a helpful untruth as freely 
and unrelentingly as a man straying in bog-land 
would put his foot upon a strong bit of ground which, 
for the time, held him above the mire." 

The death of Foe's child-wife marked in his 
career, thinks the author, the beginning of an 
epoch of general degeneracy, the detailed story 
of which had better been left untold. 

" We have hardly a right to regard what he did after 
this whether in the way of writing, of love-making, 
or of business projects as the work of a wholly re- 
sponsible creature." 

But the taint in Foe's character is never mani- 
fest in his verse. 

" Again, and in highest praise of this erratic genius, 
it must be said, that in bis pages even in the mag- 
ical renderings of Baudelaire there is no lewdness ; 
no beastly double-meanings ; not a line to pamper sen- 
sual appetites; he is clear and cool as Arctic mornings." 

Mr. Mitchell speaks in his preface of " a 
great welter of provisionary notes," yet unused, 
touching Motley, Whipple, Holland, Dr. Par- 
sons, Melville, Tuckerman, the Duykincks, and 
others. We hope to see this budget of mem- 
oranda embodied in a third book of " American 
Talks " in the near future. The volume is at- 
tractively made throughout, the profuse and 
well-chosen illustrations forming a tempting 
feature. E. o. j. 



RELIGION IN GREEK LITERATURE.* 

The hopeless welter of uncoordinated fact 
and unverified hypothesis in which the study 
of Greek religion is losing itself is due to two 
causes. (1) The fundamental principles of 
the science are so involved with religious and 
philosophical prepossessions that it is vain to 
look for a reconciliation aud harmonizing of 
opposite schools in any generally accepted con- 
ception of the psychology of primitive man and 
the philosophy of prehistoric history. (2) The 
historical verification of the countless hypothe- 
ses thrown out by learned ingenuity is rarely 
possible owing to the gaps in our evidence, and 
even the attempt to win a clear oversight of 
the work accomplished is greatly embarrassed 
by the reluctance of scholars to admit any lim- 
its to the amount of information which plaus- 
ible speculation may extract from a defective 
record. In so comparatively simple a matter, 
for example, as the literary growth of Greek 
legend from Homer to Pindar and the drama- 
tists, there is much that we shall never know 
for the plain reason that the literature is lost. 
But a little difficulty like that cannot curb the 
soaring genius of a Wilamovitz-Moellendorf. 
He reconstructs an entire lost epic of Hesiod 
from three fragmentary lines, and a few no- 
tices in late mythological handbooks that may 
or may not be based on Hesiod. " Das ist ein 
stuck Ewiger Poesie," he exclaims, in ecstatic 
contemplation of his handiwork ; and he confi- 
dently looks forward to the time when the " pro- 
gress of investigation " shall have thus " recon- 
structed " all the lost poets of Greece as a 
basis for the definitive study of Greek religion 
and mythology. But those of us who lack this 
robust faith in divinatory methods must be 
content to ask many questions to which we can 
hardly expect final answers. 

What is the relative weight and significance 
for early Greek religion of the various " true 
courses " indicated by the terms totem ism, tree 
worship, disease of language ; which is the 
more important factor, Aryan personification 
of nature, the misunderstanding of ritual prac- 
tices, or half-conscious poetical symbolism? 
Are the earliest allusions in extant literature 
to a deity or a religious conception " germs " 
or " interpolations "? What is the date of ori- 
gin and the significance of the religious mys- 
ticism associated with the name of Orpheus? 
Which of the Greek cults and gods are autoch-

thonous or " Pelasgic," and which came in from 
Phrygia, ^Egypt, or Phoenicia ? Are the Ary- 
ans or the Semites in possession of the key to 
all Greek mythologies ? Are resemblances be- 
tween apparently disparate cults to be ex- 
plained as coincidences or as " contaminations "? 
On what lines were the various cults diffused 
through Greece, from North to South or from 
East to West, by land or by sea ? To every 
one of these questions something in our frag- 
mentary evidence suggests a conceivable, some- 
times a plausible, answer. The " investigator " 
marshals an appalling erudition in the effort 
to convert these possibilities to certainties. His 
position is that of the coming New Zealander, 
if after two thousand years he finds himself 
confronted with about half of the best English 
poetry, and a miscellaneous collection of docu- 
ments recovered from the corner-stones of 
American churches, and attempts therewith to 
reconstruct not merely the general trend of 
religious and ethical thought in the Nineteenth 
century, but the local history of every Amer- 
ican sect and parish, and behind that the origin, 
diffusion, and history of Christianity in Europe. 

In this state of the science I am inclined to 
congratulate Professor Campbell that his " Re- 
ligion in Greek Literature " a " Sketch in 
Outline," as he modestly terms it is not an 
" investigation," and will probably, like Pater's 
admirable " Plato and Platonism," be dismissed 
by the " selten eischeinende Monatschrift " 
with the remark, " bringt nichts neues." It 
does not bring anything new in the way of bold 
original generalization and hypothesis, or even 
of patient gathering of hitherto uncollected fact. 
But the combination in Professor Campbell of 
sobriety and sanity of judgment with sound and 
intimate knowledge of the religious thought of 
the great Greek writers, and a pleasant and read- 
able style these things will be new and very 
grateful to the amateur in these difficult matters. 

As his title implies, Professor Campbell deals 
rather with the religious thought of Greece as 
reflected in the poets and philosophers than 
with picturesque superstitions and survivals, or 
the traditional cults and conventional half be- 
liefs of the multitude. In the technical science 
of religions he is, as his pretty Greek epigram 
avows, a late learner of a new-fangled wisdom. 
But he has a life-long familiarity with the best 
that was thought and said in Greece, and there 
are probably few specialists in Greek religion 
who could write as sanely, as comprehensively, 
and as sympathetically as he has done of the 
religion of Herodotus, Euripides, Socrates, and 
Plato. And it is well that scholars, in their 



preoccupation with detail, should be reminded 
that our primary concern in this matter is not 
the curiosities and the quaintnesses of folk-lore 
and popular religion, but the thought of the 
few supreme spirits of Greece : 

"That few is all the world which with a few 
Doth ever live and move and work and strive." 

It may even be that the clear utterances of the 
few will tell us more of the serious and abiding 
beliefs of the many than we can learn from 
any literal catalogue of quaint practices and 
superstitious fancies nominally surviving among 
them. In Xeuophon's " Economist," Ischo- 
machus instructs his child-wife in a gentle and 
wholesome form of Socratic natural religion. 
It may well be, as Professor Campbell sensibly 
observes, that " this glimpse of an Attic inte- 
rior, idealized though it may be, teaches us more 
about Attic religion than the information that 
the person thus instructed had danced the bear 
dance at ten years old, or had carried the bas- 
ket in honor of Athene at fifteen." And in 
another place he shows entertainingly what 
strange conceptions of the religious life of Scot- 
land might be conveyed by a travelling folk- 
lorist who should describe the rites of the local 
Bacchus, John Barleycorn, and enumerate vari- 
ous quaint observances alluded to by Burns and 
still kept up, such as burning hazel-nuts on the 
hearth-stone, hanging out horse shoes as a pro- 
tection against the evil eye, making offerings at 
sacred wells to which the sick and infirm are 
brought for healing, touching cold iron after en- 
countering a pig, etc. It will be a pity if the ana- 
logues of these things in Greece should obscure 
for us Homer and Plato and Matthew Arnold's 
four prophets of the imaginative reason, Pin- 
dar, Simonides, Sophocles, and JEschylus. 

Space fails to follow with Professor Camp- 
bell the process by which the naive but beau- 
tiful and wholesome anthropomorphism of 
Homer developed into the sublime monotheism 
(for this it virtually is) of the great religious 
odes of 2Eschylus and Sophocles. Nor can we 
pause to trace the parallel growth of ethical 
reflection whereby the prudential or political 
morality of Hesiod, Theognis, and the gnomic 
poets was transformed into the ideal and abso- 
lute ethics of Plato, perhaps the first European 
to affirm that God is not jealous, that punish- 
ment should never be vindictive, and that the 
good man will never harm even his enemy. 
The pages on Socrates, and the summing up 
on Euripides are especially good. 

These chapters were originally written for 
the Gifford lectureship on religion, to which 
Professor Campbell was elected by his col-

leagues upon his retirement from the chair of 
Greek at St. Andrews. A few inaccuracies, 
to be expected in the manuscript of lectures, 
seemed to have escaped the author's eye in the 
revision for the press. Horace's line in cute 
curandaplus aequo operetta juventus is quoted 
from memory nimium studiosa juventus (p. 
88). The maxim " to give is nobler than to 
receive " is quoted as from Hesiod's Works 
and Days." The student will seek it there in 
vain. In a few instances the passages cited 
are wrongly translated. Pindar did not say 
(P- 176), * in all that is pretty there is com- 
pnlsion," but " compulsion [necessity] makes 
anything honorable" justifies anything. Aris- 
tophanes, if the reference on page 21 is to the 
well-known passage of the " Clouds," does not 
speak of " filling up the image of virtue," but 
of " polluting the image of modesty." The ren- 
derings of Heracleitus on page 91 are inexact. 
Fr. 91, for example, is not " We can speak 
with confidence only while we follow the thought 
which comprehends all things, even as the law 
of the state controls all things, only much more 
firmly," but "those who speak with intelli- 
gence must hold fast by the universal, even 
as a city holds fast by its law, and even more 
firmly." The text of the Pindaric passage on 
page 173 must follow some strangely obsolete 
edition. For Ermine Rolide (page 246 and 
index) read Erwin. It is misleading to speak 
(page 322) of a contradiction between phys- 
ical and moral courage in the " Laches." The 
" Laches " does not mention moral courage in 
our sense of the word. In a few other cases 
the views of the latest and best authorities have 
been ignored. Few scholars now mistake for 
intentional caricature the naive archaism of 
the Arcesilaus vase (page 167). The purer 
spirituality of Aphrodite Ousania is probably 
a Platonic fancy, and the contrasted epithet 
Pandemos has purely political significance. 
Demeter Achaia is probably simply Achaean 
Demeter and not "Our Lady of Sorrows." 
The Semitic origin of the Gephyraeans is 
rightly rejected by Toepfer, and the specula- 
tions about the Semitic strain in Harmodius 
and Aristogeiton are purely fantastic. 

These trifling inadvertencies in no wise impair 
the value of this readable and helpful sketch in 
outline of a great subject a worthy parergon 
of the author's more serious studies. That he 
may enjoy his Italian retirement for many fruit- 
ful years, and crown his work with the promised 
Platonic Lexicon, will be the hope of all his 
friends and admirers. PAUL SHOREY. 



SEEN WITH JAPANESE EYES.* 

It was the brilliant observation of a wise 
man that in the foreigner we have contempor-

those who are to come after us exist, in all 
their critical possibilities, just across the nar- 
row line of nationality. If this is true of the 
nations of Europe in respect of one another, 
how much more true is it of Japan and its re- 
lations with Christendom ! For the first time 
since the days of Saladin and the Saracens, a 
nation as alert mentally as any professing faith 
in the Cross is looking with clear eyes through 
the centuries, selecting with marked abilities 
the good in our polity, rejecting with scrupul- 
osity all that seems to serve no useful end, bring- 
ing itself into accord with the facts of the 
modern world, and so within a generation or 
two accomplishing by a process of artificial evo- 
lution all that we Occidentals wrought through 
dark and bloody ages. 

Mr. Stafford Ransome, an engineer of re- 
pute, and for a time the correspondent in Japan 
of the " Morning Post " of London, has pre- 
pared a book which has for its object the bring- 
ing within Western comprehension the pro- 
gress of the Japanese Empire since the over- 
throw of China. But while giving us the 
opportunity to see with his trained powers of 
observation what it is that has taken place in 
that country, he incidentally provides a pair of 
Eastern spectacles wherewith we may see our- 
selves. This, we are sure, is the greater achieve- 
ment of the two, and by much the more inter- 
esting. 

Mr. Ransome has done wisely in endeavor- 
ing at the outset to overthrow any conception 
of these most capable people which the traveler 
may base upon life in the treaty ports. He 
institutes a parallel between that and the judg- 
ment a Japanese might form of England if 
there were established, say at Wapping Old 
Stairs, a foreign commercial community which 
did not acquire the speech of the country, but 
lived its own life in its own manner, preserv- 
ing its customs and costumes, and violently 
abusing in its own press all that it found in 
the stranger land inharmonious with its own 
ideas, chiefly because the English workmen, 
interpreters, cabmen, and the like, were not 
educated gentlemen. In doing this he goes 
further, and calls attention to the notions of

morality these sojourners would form of the 
English, basing their conclusions on the dis- 
orders incident to a seafaring and transient 
population. 

The writer does not say, as he might have 
said, that with many men environment serves 
for morality, and the laying off of accustomed 
associations too often serves as an excuse for 
hideous immorality; but he calls attention to 
the fact that the complaints brought against 
the Japanese by Europeans are largely of hab- 
its formed in compliance with European de- 
mands, and, as far as native wit will serve, on 
European models ; and he goes further, and 
in an illuminating passage replies to the foreign 
critic by showing that all he urges against the 
morality of this Oriental race the Japanese 
sends back in kind as an accusation against 
foreigners as he has seen them. This is as it 
should be, and it may serve to destroy that 
cocksureness in the virtues of our own civiliza- 
tion which leads us to obtrude it upon others. 

One of the recent speeches of Count Okuma 
is translated for our benefit : 

" Comparing Europeans with Japanese, I do not think 
that the Europeans then [thirty years ago] in Japan 
were a particularly high class of persons ; nor do I think 
that those here now are particularly high class. On 
the whole, I think they would not have been reckoned 
higher than middle-class in Europe. Among diplo- 
matic officials there may have been men of high stand- 
ing, but the general run of merchants were of the middle 
and lower classes. Middle and lower classes though 
they did belong to, however, when we compare them 
with the Japanese of the time, how great was the dif- 
ference in the degree of their civilization. The for- 
eigners living in Yokohama, Nagasaki, and so forth, 
seemed to know everything, and were many degrees 
superior to the Japanese. Their ideas were so large 
that the Japanese were astounded. I was a student at 
the time, and I remember that on one occasion, think- 
ing that a certain foreigner was a wonderful scholar, I 
went to ask him a question, but when I look back now 
I recognize that he was not even equal to a Japanese 
middle-school graduate. Still, I was surprised at the 
explanations I received from him." 

Here, in a word, is set forth the facts to 
which we so-called progressive nations must 
accustom ourselves. If this is news to us, so 
is much of similar purport which Mr. Ransome 
brings. He warns us more than once against 
mistaking the present condition of Japan for a 
new thing brought about by the waging of a 
particularly successful war. What the sub- 
jects of the Mikado are to-day they have been 
fitting themselves for from a time really an- 
terior to the epoch-making voyage and diplo- 
macy of Matthew Calbraith Perry. The perti- 
nent question of " Who, among the Europeans, 



brought it about ? " is answered decisively, with- 
out pretence of modesty, and convincingly. It 
certainly was not the leading merchants of for- 
eign birth, nor their consuls, nor even their 
ministers and ambassadors. It was not even 
any one conspicuous in the European colonies 
in the various treaty ports. As will be shown 
presently in more detail, it was not the mis- 
sionaries, though these contributed to the result 
with fine unconsciousness. Who, then, was it? 

Two classes of educated persons, chiefly 
Englishmen and Americans ; one of them 
laboring in the educational world as professors 
in the Imperial University and other state 
colleges, men, as the author writes, who 
" were leading a more or less retired life, so 
far as the rest of the European world in 
Japan was concerned " ; the other laboring in 
the manufacturing world as engineers and 
executive officers, and also remote from their 
countrymen socially. It is only natural that 
these unobtrusive elements in the shaping of 
modern Japan should be overlooked, until an 
engineer, who is by reason of his attainments 
to be classed among them, brings them into 
the light ; but it is not quite what we were 
expecting. 

Hardly less to be foreseen is the entirely 
candid estimate which is set upon the mission- 
aries and their work. In the beginning of 
their career in Japan, each mission sought to 
gain the support of the natives by the same 
means now used in social settlements among 
our own less favored communities. Chief of 
these were schools, both secular and religious. 
Coming at a time when the Japanese were 
seeking knowledge with an avidity we can 
hardly conceive, these schools were most suc- 
cessful. But, Mr. Ransome points out, this 
was only until the government could make its 
own intelligent arrangements for the instruc- 
tion of its people ; and to-day the mission 
school which does not afford a better educa- 
tion than the government has ceased to exist 
as a factor in Japanese life. Most of them, 
indeed, have had to be secularized in order to 
survive. And as for the scholars, they gained 
their education, and, not finding Christianity 
useful, let it fall into desuetude. 

If Japan is to become Christian at all, the 
book concludes, it will be by some such process 
as the missionaries to northern Europe were 
familiar with hundreds of years ago, when the 
king declared for the new faith and his sub- 
jects meekly followed him into the fold. It 
may suit the purposes of the Japanese govern-

ment, if it can see the good to be gained by 
it, to tarn the people to the Cross. If the man- 
date is given, it will be obeyed. If it is not 
given, the people will remain as they are. The 
one thoroughly effective missionary establish- 
ment in Japan to-day, says Mr. Kansome, is 
conducted by French Jesuits. 

Space does not permit consideration of other 
things in this excellent work, though many are 
of almost equal interest. There is a chapter 
on the modern drama which is a masterpiece 
of unintentional criticism of us by the native 
actors. The business man will find pages 
devoted to his needs, which he cannot afford 
to neglect. Students in many widely different 
fields of human endeavor will find matters 
falling within the scope of their specialties. 
The book is well printed, and excellently 
illustrated with half-tone reproductions of 
photographs. WALLACE RICE.

his place among the hard workers of the world. Two 
things are very marked about this hook. One of 
them is the author's sympathy for the weaknesses of 
average humanity, or his belief that the upright life 
is achieved not by a straight path, but rather by one 
that zigzags its way along with many missteps. The 
other is the curious and loving intimacy which he 
displays with the things of nature with the woods 
and fields and the living things that inhabit them. 
It is the intimacy that only a country boyhood knows, 
and that most men lose when other interests super- 
sede. Mr. Waterloo has preserved this feeling for 
nature in all its freshness, and his best pages are 
those which are given over to its expression. As to 
construction, this novel is well-planned, although the 
closing episode of the race to record a deed seems 
to be affixed like an incongruous bay-window. The 
graces of style are not given to the writer, but he 
commands homely and acceptable English of a vig- 
orous sort. 

When we took up Mr. George Morton's Greek 
story of " A Fair Brigand," we feared another idyl 
in the manner of his " Constantino," dealing mainly 
with native types, and seeking after poetic effect 
more than dramatic incident. But we found instead 
an exciting story of the same general type as About's 
Roi des Montagues," with a similarly stirring plot, 
and the substitution of exaggerated American humor 
for the more delicate French wit. Mr. Horton is 
a journalist, and the temptation to burlesque the de- 
vices of " enterprising " newspapers and their spe- 
cial correspondents was doubtless strong, yet this 
introduces a broadly farcical element into what would 
otherwise be consistent serio-comedy. The hero of 
this tale is a student in the American school at 
Athens, which institution the author has viewed at 
first hand, but with sufficient detachment of mind to 
enable him to discover the humorous aspects of this 
nest of archaeologists. The termination of the story 
is abrupt and unsatisfactory. 

Henry of Navarre has furnished material for 
more than one romancer, and his appearance in Mr. 
W. H. Johnson's "The King's Henchman " will be 
pleasantly remembered by assiduous readers of cur- 
rent fiction. In " King or Knave," by the same au- 
thor, we have a continuation of the story of Jean 
Fourcade, combined with the courtship of the King 
and Gabrielle d'Estre'es. The story of the Armada 
is introduced in the early chapters, to be followed 
by the conflict of the royalists with the League, the 
assassinations of both Guise and the King, and the 
triumphal progress of the Be"arnain to Ivry and the 
certainty of the throne. It is Henry the ardent and 
unscrupulous lover rather than Henry the warrior 
who is presented to us in these pages, and the figure 
is not a sympathetic one. As for Gabrielle, it must 
be admitted that she accepted dishonor with her 
eyes open, and neither the book of history nor the 
novel now before us can make of her a heroine to 
love and admire. Mr. Johnson has certainly caught 
the trick of the conventional romance of history and 
deals with his material in very pretty fashion.

In " A Gentleman Player," Mr. R. N. Stephens 
adds noticeably to the laurels already won for him 
by " An Enemy to the King " and " The Road to 
Paris." The " gentleman player " of this romance 
of Elizabethan England is one of the performers at 
the Globe Theatre, reduced to this state of reverses, 
although a gentleman born and bred. The author 
is even daring enough to introduce the figure of 
Shakespeare himself into the opening chapters, and 
to set speech upon his lips. But the Globe and the 
City are soon left behind, for the substance of the 
story relates to a wild-goose chase which the hero 
leads the Queen's poursuivant, impersonating the 
friend whom he seeks to save from arrest, and with 
such success that for five days of exciting flight 
northwards, the pursuer follows the false trail thus 
laid, and misses his real object altogether. There is 
a heroine, of course, and equally of course she is 
cold and haughty until the closing chapters, when 
she melts in the approved fashion of all such hero- 
ines. The author has devised some extremely clever 
situations, chief among them being that in which 
the " gentleman player," caught at last, contrives to 
escape by enacting the part of Tybalt in a provin- 
cial performance of " Romeo and Juliet," given by 
his former associates in a town where his captors 
have been delayed for a few hours. 

It is difficult to discover the author of so sweet 
and graceful a novel as " Claudia Hyde " in " The 
Ladder of Fortune," Mrs. Frances Courtenay Bay- 
lor Barnum's latest work. Somehow or other, the 
characters with whom she deals seem to react upon 
her expression, and in the present case, since the 
characters are hopelessly commonplace and vulgar, 
the effect is unfortunate. The book tells the story 
of an uneducated and unimaginative American, with 
an extraordinary talent for making money, and of 
his wife, a woman of the hard, vulgar, unsympa- 
thetic sort, with an equal talent for elbowing her 
way into society. It is simply the record of her 
progress up the social ladder, from the frontier town 
in which the start is made to those circles of wealthy 
Americans and Europeans into which it is possible 
for the energetic parvenu to effect an entrance. 
The two characters are remorselessly depicted, and 
the writer's attitude toward them is one of mingled 
admiration and loathing. It is hardly needful to re- 
mark that no writer who thus stands outside his 
characters can make them live. By way of con- 
trast, we get near the end some refreshing glimpses 
of an unspoiled daughter of these parents, and in 
the story of her love, the charm of simple and whole- 
some ideals of life finds its way into the story. But 
the total impression is unpleasant, and we wonder 
that Mrs. Barnum should have had the resolution 
to write such a book. 

" A Tent of Grace " is a Rhineland story of the 
middle nineteenth century. The heroine is a Jew- 
ish girl, rescued as a child from a life of wretched- 
ness, and adopted into the family of the village 
pastor. She grows up to be a very beautiful girl, 
and the son of the family falls in love with her, thus 



putting to naught the ambitions of his parents, and 
raising the question of race and religion in all its 
bitterness. As a child, the heroine had been beaten 
nearly to death by a crowd of angry Christian 
children, and the same spirit of Judenhetze pursues 
her into the after years, and finally causes her murder 
at the hands of a mob of fanatical rustics. Here is 
evidently the material for an effective story, and it 
must be said that Mrs. Lust is thoroughly conver- 
sant with the scenes and situations of which she 
writes. But unfortunately she has no delicacy of 
style, and the chromo-coloring of the heightened 
episodes, as well as the awkward touches bestowed 
upon the details, are a constant offence to a refined 
taste. We should judge that English was an ac- 
quired idiom rather than the birthright of the novel- 
ist, and the very considerable force of the book is 
offset by the failure to attain to felicitous express- 
ion. 

" The Mandate " is a novel of hypnotism, insom- 
nia, and insanity. Lest this cheerful summary re- 
pel prospective readers, we hasten to add that, 
granted the unpleasant stuff with which the writer 
has had to work, the novel is an example of skilful 
workmanship considerably above the average. We 
always suspect hypnotism as a motive in fiction ; it 
is apt to lend itself to the cheapest sort of sensa- 
tionalism, and to imaginings in the name of science 
which science would indignantly disavow. But in 
the present case, the motive seems to be used in a 
legitimate way. The hypnotist is a gentleman who 
happens to be in love with the wife of his subject 
(the latter being a most objectionable person of the 
cad or bounder variety), and suggests to him when 
in a trance, that he will die at a certain hour on the 
following day. The hour comes, and the man dies, 
but the situation is saved scientifically by presenting 
physical conditions amply sufficient to account for 
his taking off, without invoking the explanation of 
the hypnotic suggestion. The real centre of inter- 
est is not in the death of this most superfluous hus- 
band, but in the mental condition of the hypnotist. 
The latter firmly believes that he has committed 
murder, and it is from this conviction that we pass 
into the tragedy of insomnia and insanity that ends 
the tale. As a psychological study, it is worked out 
with considerable power, and the novel displays so 
much general ability that it is really far more inter- 
esting than this outline would indicate. 

" Adrian Rome " is a novel of modern English 
society, having for its hero one of those " problem- 
atic characters " described by Goethe, and so typi- 
cal of our modern age that many a novelist, both 
before and after Herr Spielhagen, has been im- 
pelled to deal with them. Through defect of will 
and lack of a definite purpose he makes a failure of 
a life that seems to offer every opportunity of suc- 
cess. Weakly renouncing the love that might have 
given him strength to live, he enters into an alli- 
ance of the formal sort that leaves the springs of 
feeling untouched, and a tragic ending is the only 
way out of the impasse into which he has drifted.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



There is much excellent observation in this story, 
combined with effective delineation, and a finished 
method of expression. 

Mr. Grant Allen's latest book is a pot-boiler un- 
abashed. This being the case, we need waste no 
words in commenting upon style, plot, or character- 
ization. It will be sufficient to state that " Miss 
Cay ley's Adventures " tells the story of a young 
woman who finds herself penniless in London, and 
who concludes that this is just the time for her to 
make a tour round the world. That she carries out 
her plan successfully, and has many entertaining 
experiences by the way, may be taken for granted 
by those who know the sprightliness of the author's 
invention. The book makes pleasant unprofitable 
reading, and holds the attention throughout. 

" When the Sleeper Wakes " is a somewhat dis- 
appointing book. The fertile fancy of the author, 
and his quasi-scientific way of dealing with vast or 
grotesque impossibilities, have not resulted, upon this 
occasion, in a story that is either clear or convinc- 
ing. We are simply dazed at the twenty-first cen- 
tury London into which we (in company with the 
awakened sleeper) are incontinently plunged, and 
the system of girders, and wind-vanes, and flying 
stages which are the author's principal marvels, 
seems to be the outcome of a cheap and confused 
invention. There is much ingenuity about the 
forecast, much skilful elaboration of details, but 
there is no imaginative reach, no real impossiveness. 

Were it not for the copyright of the present year, 
we should take " A Princess of Vascovy," by Mr. 
John Oxenham, for a reprint of some early essay 
in fiction-writing. Certainly, it has little of the 
careful style and psychological insight of " God's 
Prisoner," which we reviewed a few months ago, 
and has, in fact, nothing to recommend it save the 
interest of the plot. Considered merely as a story, 
however, as an ingenious and straightforward nar- 
rative, it holds the attention closely, and may be 
pronounced successful. The heroine is a princess 
of a quite imaginary kingdom in Eastern Europe, 
and she comes to her own after a career of the most 
varied adventure, beginning in the wilds of South 
America, continued in the islands of the Pacific, 
and ended in the little realm to which fate at last 
restores her. The book is somewhat in the fashion 
of Mr. Hope's " Zenda " tales, and its incidents are 
of a similarly exciting character. 

Still more suggestive of the " Zenda " sort of ro- 
mance is Mr. Arthur W. Marchmont's " A Dash for 
a Throne." Here we have an actual personation of 
the prince by the hero, who lends himself to the in- 
trigue, first, because it seems the only way of work- 
ing out the ends of justice, and afterwards, pour 
U* beaux yeux of the heroine, whom he cannot de- 
sert in her hour of peril. The throne in this case 
is specifically that of Bavaria, although the happen- 
ings described are as far from any actual history as 
are those chronicled in the imaginary annals of 
Ruritania. The story is a capital one, reeking with 
romantic sentiment, and filled to the full with vil- 



lanies, all of which the hero ontwiU. We have 
to thank the writer for much exciting entertainment. 

" Castle Czvargas " is a capital romance of Con- 
tinental adventure in the seventeenth century. It 
was in the year of the Great Fire that an English 
lad was sent by his parents on a journey to Munich 
for the purpose of transacting certain business con- 
nected with an inheritance. His task performed, 
he set forth on the homeward journey, but was cap- 
tured and held imprisoned by a robber-baron in the 
wilds of Southeastern Germany. News of hit* plight 
reaching England, his brother started upon an ex- 
pedition of rescue, and the story told us is that of 
the skill and strength of arm with which the two 
English youths got the better of Count Czvargas, 
captured his own stronghold from him, compassed 
his well-deserved death, and carried away from 
captivity at the same time the German maiden who 
is the heroine of the romance. It is an exciting 
tale, fit to captivate both old and young. 

"The Garden of Swords " is the fantastic title 
given by Mr. Max Pemberton to a story of the 
Franco-Prussian War, which culminates in the 
siege and capitulation of Strassburg. The heroine 
is the English wife of a French soldier, and the 
private interest of the story is centred about her 
relations with an Englishman, serving in the Prus- 
sian army, who has befriended her in an hour of 
deadly peril, and risked his own life by entering 
the doomed city to bring her news of her captured 
husband. The husband learns of all this devotion 
only to place upon it the most dishonorable inter- 
pretation, and his conduct is so contemptible that it 
is not easy to rejoice in the reconciliation between 
the two, even though it takes place at the bedside 
where he lies fatally wounded by one of the besieg- 
ers' shells. With all due pity for the sufferings of 
the French people in their year of agony, the author 
makes his lack of genuine sympathy with them a 
little too evident, and it is clear that both his ad- 
miration and his heart go with the invaders. For 
the rest, the story is prettily told, with some poetry 
of phrase, and a fairly vivid realization of its dra- 
matic possibilities. 

The great and deserved vogue of Mr. Sienkiewicz 
has had its natural consequence in the translation 
of his unimportant and immature work, his trans- 
lator relying on the magic of the author's name to 
secure a public for the least of his productions. We 
cannot say that this result is a regrettable one, for 
everything that can throw light upon the develop- 
ment of so great a talent is of interest, but readers 
must not expect too much of the book now pub- 
lished, which was the first of the author's literary 
works. Considered absolutely, " In Vain " is of 
small value ; considered as a first book, written by 
a boy of seventeen, it is one of the wonders of lit- 
erature. Glaringly crude as it is in many ways, 
there is in it a distinct foreshadowing of the power 
that was to produce " Without Dogma " and The 
Children of the Soil," and it has also a consider- 
able degree of intrinsic interest. It is a novel of

student days at Kieff, and was written when the 
author was himself a student at Warsaw. As a 
naive portrayal of university life in Eastern Europe, 
it offers us something so radically different from 
anything that the corresponding conditions in En- 
gland or America could offer, that for this reason 
alone it deserves attention. But it gives us more 
than this. It is a story of passion, of abnegation, 
and of moral triumph ; the wine of youth courses 
through its veins, and we forgive its faults for the 
sake of its obvious sincerity. 

Fru Amalie Skram, a Norwegian woman who is 
the wife of a well-known Danish scholar, has elected 
to write fiction under the banner of " naturalism," 
and has been seriously likened to M. Zola. Her 
work is now first introduced to the English public 
by a well-made translation of " Professor Hierony- 
mus." Herr BjSrnson, who is a warm admirer of 
the writer, has characterized the book in these terms: 
It is the first time that a great author in full pos- 
session of her mental powers has had the opportu- 
nity of making such a study. Seeking quiet and 
treatment for a nervous affection, Fru Skram of 
her own free will became an inmate of a lunatic 
asylum. Thus she had a chance of studying one of 
those specialists in mental disease who are too apt 
to mistake rebelliousness for a sign of mental de- 
rangement. Of this doctor, of the patients, the 
nurses, her whole environment, she gives a picture 
so vivid, of such absorbing interest, that it can vie 
with the most thrilling romance." This praise seems 
to us overdrawn, and, assuming the writer's pur- 
pose to be that of establishing abuses in the treat- 
ment of the insane, she is only half-convincing. It 
is indeed a chamber of horrors into which she leads 
us, but, barring a few minor instances of heedless- 
ness, the asylum seems to be conducted upon hu- 
mane and scientific principles. As far as Hierony- 
mus is concerned, we cannot make out what the 
writer is driving at. He is certainly an unsympa- 
thetic figure, but certainly not the monster she 
would have us think him. We should warn pros- 
pective readers that the book has no plot whatso- 
ever ; it is the bare journal, day by day, of the 
asylum experiences of the heroine, and does not 
even end with her release. This suggests possibil- 
ities of more volumes of the same sort, which may 



Heaven avert.

one may naturally reflect how differently this mod-

scion of the Hohenzollerns, whose Consecrated Per-

gratulation, what apostrophes to the irresistible

the royal megalomania. The task which he faced,

quarter of a century ago, to assume the rule of a

with change and alternating foreign occupation, was 
one of the utmost difficulty. His future kingdom 
lay in the cock-pit of the Near East, surrounded by 
petty powers whose governments were even more 
unstable than its own, and jealously regarded by 
both Russia and Turkey, for each of which powers 
it had for nearly a century formed a bone of con- 
tention. Out of this political and financial chaos 
the young Prince, through the exercise of really 
remarkable ability as statesman and soldier, gradu- 
ally brought Roumania to its present independent 
and comparatively stable and flourishing condition. 
The story of this achievement is interestingly and 
almost too self-effacingly told in these Reminis- 
cences. The narrator touches briefly upon his mar- 
riage to the Princess Elizabeth of Wied (the " Car- 
men Sylva " of letters) ; and his share in the Turco- 
Russian war, in which he commanded a division of 
allied Russian and Roumanian troops, is dwelt upon 
in some detail. The correspondence of Prince 
Charles with Bismarck, Queen Victoria, and the 
German Emperor, forms an element of considerable 
interest, and the book must, on the whole, be re- 
garded as a desirable and an authoritative contri- 
bution to the history of the Eastern Question. The 
editor provides an intelligently written sketch and 
appreciation of Prince Charles, a portrait of whom 
forms the frontispiece of the well-appointed volume. 

The fight of Sixty-four years ago, when Mr. R. 

a corporation H. Dana, in his adventurous cruise 
with the people. Before the Mast," visited the coast 
of Southern California, his ship one day came to 
anchor in the roadstead of San Pedro, which he de- 
scribes as " the only port for a distance of eighty 
miles." It was not much of a port, and not much 
of one was needed for the slender commerce of those 
pastoral days. But fifty years later, when the rich 
interior region had been developed, and Los Ange- 
les, its chief city, had become an important com- 
mercial centre, the need of an improved harbor was 
keenly felt. Two rival points on the sea- coast con- 
tended for the improvements which Congress was 
asked to make San Pedro on the south, and Santa 
Monica on the west, each about twenty miles from 
Los Angeles, each having railroad connection with 
that city, and each having good natural advantages 
for a harbor, though the reports of the U. S. engi- 
neers sent to make surveys were decidedly in favor 
of San Pedro. The interests of the great railroad 
corporation of California, the Southern Pacific Com- 
pany, led it to desire the selection of Santa Monica, 
and the claims of this place were pressed with great 
force and determination, and with all the known and

THE DIAL

unknown resources of that almost omnipotent or- 
ganization. The citizens of Los Angeles were no 
less determined in favor of San Pedro ; and a con- 
test was began which, carried on in California and 
in Washington, was waged for eight years with great 
stubbornness and sometimes bitterness, and finally 
resulted in a complete victory for the people. A 
government appropriation of nearly three millions 
of dollars was secured, and after many vexatious 
and baffling delays, work was finally begun at San 
Pedro in April last. The story of this memorable 
contest has been well told by Mr. Charles Dwight 
Willard, a practised and graceful writer, in a volume 
entitled " The Free-Harbor Contest" (Ktngsley- 
Barnes & Neuner Co., Los Angeles). It is well 
worth reading, not only for its many interesting and 
often stirring episodes, but for its practical demon- 
stration that even the most powerful corporations 
are not all-powerful when opposed by an aroused 
and determined public sentiment. 

To be a bookish man and a states- 
man, as Lord Rosebery demon- 
strates in one of the best of his recent 
"Appreciations and Addresses" (John Lane), is 
not an easy nor necessarily a logical matter. Yet he 
goes back over the list of the prime ministers of En- 
gland for more than a century and produces results 
which must fill the American enthusiast for learn- 
ing and culture with envy. Among these, surely, 
Lord Rosebery is himself to be ranked, if only for 
the volume before us, with its interesting and mul- 
tifarious table of contents. A distinction, rather 
than a difference, is made between the Apprecia- 
tions, which include estimates of the life or work or 
character or all three of various persons, and of the 
city of London ; and the Addresses, which deal with 
subjects less personal, the best of them being on 
" Bookishness and Statesmanship." But all are 
taken from the lips of the speaker in some public 
place, and have been edited in their present form 
by Mr. Charles Geake. They still retain the flavor 
of matters which, were they less literary in content, 
would make against their reception, yet they have 
with this a certain dry humor which is only less en- 
joyable in the printed page than it must have been 
when voiced by the speaker's lips. Many other 
amiable qualities combine with this to make the 
speeches worthy attention and for those who 
intend to speak in public themselves of study. 
They are in the best of taste, they are sufficiently 
erudite, they are always happy in all the meanings 
of that greatly abused word, they are neither too 
long nor too short in fine, they have every qual- 
ity except those which enthusiasm and genius alone 

can lend. 

A clear idea of what an American 
college really is at a given moment 
was never perhaps caught with more 
success nor set down with more animation than 
characterizes " Yale : Her Campus, Class- Rooms, 
and Athletics," by Messrs. Lewis Sheldon Welch 



and Walter Camp, two graduates of that ancient 
institution whose names are a guaranty at once for 
good workmanship and for a proper Yale spirit. 
Just at what is generally felt to be a turning-point 
in the career of this great university and mother of 
universities, a large volume, almost encyclopaedic 
in scope and intention, is issued, from which may 
be had a conception of what Yale men think of 
themselves and of their college. No department 
of the great university is left without commemora- 
tion, and the sub-title gives but a faint hint of this 
inclusiveness. One of the chapters is given the 
name, " For God, for Country, and for Yale." This 
represents the feeling throughout the large work ; 
yet it must not be taken as a universal panegyric 
even though the point of view is that of Yale 
men for Yale, and the rest of the world is not con- 
sidered except as subordinate. We have a notion 
that the preparation of a work ten years hence of 
similar purpose will show a different idea back of 
the university and perhaps a better and more 
generous one. That Yale should feel the defeats 
in athletics of a single year sufficiently to call a 
general alumni meeting for the purpose of ascer- 
taining the causes leading up to them, has seemed 
to many friends of American colleges somewhat 
disproportionate when other matters in which Yale 
has been interested are taken into account. Why 
it should be so, this book explains between the 
lines as well as in them. But it is something of 
which Yale men should be proud in the main, and 
it is admirably presented by the publishers, Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Company. 

The figure of William T. Sherman 
looms large in any account of the 
Civil War, and it is tolerably certain 
that time will rather enhance than diminish its 
proportions. An intelligent and complete biography 
of the Union leader now appears in the Great 
Commanders" series (Appleton), partly from the 
pen of the late General M. F. Force, who assumes 
the entire responsibility, and partly from the pen 
of General J. D. Cox, who is even better known as 
a writer. The career of General Sherman is so 
replete with incident, and that of the more import- 
ant sort, that greater brevity could hardly be 
looked for. The work is, accordingly, somewhat 
long. It is a pity, such being the case, that the 
index should be so hastily prepared as to leave it a 
lame guide at best to the 350 closely written pages. 
Though dealing first of all with the soldier, the 
work shows Sherman in his private capacity as well. 
His steadfast refusal to be dragged into politics, on 
the ground that soldiers enough had been seated in 
the presidential chair, is brought out most strongly, 
and is greatly to the credit of the man. So, too, 
is the lifelong effort he made to bring about a re- 
form in the office of the Secretary, of War, a meas- 
ure to which Grant denied his support, yielding, as 
he did too often, to the persuasions of interested 
friends. Most of the evils and accumulated horrors

of the recent war with Spain are directly due to 
this, and the contumely heaped upon the recent 
Secretary of War is plainly shown to be the result 
of continued refusals to adopt the plain teachings 
of prudence and common-sense on the part of the 
highest authority in the nation. The book deserves 
careful reading, and should take its place beside 
the best volumes in the series which it is intended 

to accompany. 

Those who have been watching the 

Lessons from our , , , .. .!_ 

historic past. changes in public sentiment within 

the last twelve months cannot help 
being impressed by the lack of knowledge of the 
historic past of America, and the disregard into 
which it seems to have fallen. That supposed bul- 
wark against innovation and lack of precedent, the 
American bar, has really led the people away 
from the uniform traditions of five generations of 
our citizens, back to the point of view of the loyalist 
of the Revolution, whose very name has been 
adopted, all unconscious of the Europeanizing 
tendency common to them both. Why it is that 
all history should be disregarded, unless there is a 
wide and deplorable ignorance of that history, it is 
impossible to say; but the publication at just this 
time of such a work as Mr. Edward McCrady's 
" History of South Carolina Under the Royal 
Government, 1719-1776" (Macmillan) serves to 
accent the imputation of ignorance. The entire 
period treated is one in which the inhabitants of 
the Carolinas, in common with those of the conti- 
nent generally, were preparing to throw off just 
such a series of oppressions as they are laboring 
with to-day. It will be seen, as from the chapters 
dealing with the Indians, that we have actually lost 
something of the governmental acumen which then 
characterized our colonial ancestors. We are less 
jealous of the rights of others, and far less punctil- 
io;^ regarding our own individual rights; we are 
governed with vust as little regard for our real wel- 
fare, and revenue is raised with just about the 
same conception of the interests of the taxpayers. 
Mr. McCrady's book is both voluminous and 
interesting, though not well proportioned. The 
desire to set down everything, rather than to main- 
tain due perspective, leads to loose and illogical 
writing occasionally. But of the value of the work 
there can be no doubt. 

Some discouraging Sach H g ht a8 the distinguished Afri- 

reveiaiions of can explorer, Mr. Lionel Decle, is 

the French army. aWe t() thrQW upQn ^ Q condition of 

the French army by a narration of his experience 
as un volontaire d'un an in 1879-81 is lurid, and 
the book resulting, "Trooper 3809: A Private 
Soldier of the Third Republic" (Scribner), is most 
discouraging reading for those who, like Abou ben 
Adhem, love their fellow-men. Making allow- 
ances for youth, for bitterness, for a possibly dis- 
agreeable manner, and for the personal equation, 
Mr. Decle appears to have entered the French 
service with patriotic enthusiasm in the perfection 



of an athletic vigor none too usual in France, and 
to have left it at the end of less than two years as 
an invalid not far from death, and despairing of the 
future of his country. That he eventually recovered, 
and was able to make of himself rather an English- 
man than a Frenchman, disclosing administrative 
and executive abilities such as France stands 
desperately in need of, make the pity the greater. 
His native land, indeed, stultified her earlier treat- 
ment of him by placing him in command of a native 
transport service during the war in Madagascar, 
but only to bear witness that the casualties of that 
expedition would have been annihilation had the 
enemy been otherwise than cowardly. Incidentally 
to the narrative, though affording the undoubted 
reason for its publication at this time, a bright 
light is thrown upon the astounding disclosures of 
the Dreyfus trial. No one reading these pages can 
doubt that France is virtually lying naked to her 
enemies as a result of flagrant delinquencies and 
gross favoritisms pervading her armies, and that 
the one animating purpose behind the officers now 
before the public is the prevention of further dis- 
closures of their worthless and vicious methods. 



European 
literature in 
cross-sections. 



" The Fourteenth Century," by Mr. 
F. J. Snell, is the third volume pub- 
lished in the series called " Periods 
of European Literature" (Scribner), edited by 
Professor Saintsbury. This method of dealing with 
European literature in cross-sections has both ad- 
vantages and disadvantages ; the latter are pecu- 
liarly apparent in the case of the present volume, 
which has to include Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, 
Chaucer, and Froissart, on the one hand, and, on 
the other, the tag- ends of French court-poetry and 
Icelandic saga, the early stages of Scottish romance, 
the growth of the new lyric in Italy, and such 
names as Marco Polo, Sir John Maundeville, St. 
Francis of Assisi, Jean Gerson, and John Wiclif. 
There is no English scholar living who could do all 
this as it should be done, and it is no reproach to 
Mr. Snell to say that, while he is a trustworthy 
writer upon the Italian and English phases of his 
period, bis knowledge concerning others is defective. 
The drama of the fourteenth century is omitted 
altogether from this survey, being left for the 
writer of the volume that will follow in the chrono- 
logical order. Mr. Snell's style is good, although 
marred by an occasional bit of misplaced flippancy, 
and his work is thoroughly readable. 



Mystifying 
the mystery 
of Dreyfus. 



What shall be said of a book like 
" Dreyfus : Letters Written to His 
Wife from Prison " (Harper) ? The 
writings, translated from the French by Mr. L. G. 
Moreau, cover the period from December, 1894, 
to February, 1898, and are introduced by Mr. 
Walter Littlefield with a brief summary of this 
most extraordinary case. Americans, as a whole, 
have made up their minds that the accused French- 
man is innocent ; Frenchmen, on the contrary, 



180 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



are resolved to believe him guilty. Real proof, 
either of guilt or innocence, xeems wholly lacking ; 
though the unfairness of the presumption of guilt 
without proof is as hateful to the mind of the 
believer in the common law as the presumption of 
innocence is to the advocates of French criminal 
procedure. If the General Staff of the French 
army has brought forth nothing of any moment in 
their attempt to show him a traitor, surely such 
letters as these afford neither proof nor presump- 
tion of innocence. If their publication at this time 
is for the purpose of influencing public sentiment 
in favor of this most unfortunate officer, it appears 
based upon the curious assumption that letters to 
a wife, written with the knowledge that they will 
be opened and read by those interested in proving 
the writer guilty, must contain the whole truth. 
The letters have no literary merit, as such. They 
are "human documents" undoubtedly, and may 
well serve as models of passion, hope, despair, 
grief, and affection, in combination. But they no 
more enlighten the understanding relative to the 
writer's character than some of the statements of 
the General Staff and that is saying a great deal. 

Mr. William T. Jacks has written 
what he styles the first consecutive 
" Life of Prince Bismarck " (Mac- 
millan) composed in the English language. Mr. 
Jacks has succeeded fairly well in his desirable 
undertaking, and his book, though rather scrimped 
and superficial and not impeccable in point of style, 
may be pronounced a good one for popular reading. 
The publishers have given it a handsome setting, and 
it is liberally illustrated. There is a map of Ger- 
many from 1815 to 1866, and the author has judi- 
ciously inserted a chapter dealing with the political 
history of Germany during the epoch immediately 
preceding 1847. It is fair to Mr. Jacks to say that 
he has been somewhat handicapped by the necessity 
of keeping his narrative within certain prescribed 
limits within which it would not be possible to com- 
press even a measurably full and satisfactory ac- 
count of the Chancellor's career. 



A popular 
biography 
of Bitmarek. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"Dante Interpreted," by Mr. Epipbanius Wilson 
(Putnam), is a simple and straightforward account of 
the poet's life and work, illustrated by many extracts 
which the author has translated into the form of the 
Spenserian stanza. The book is of the sort that attempts 
nothing original, and that may safely be recommended 
to beginners, although it is by no means upon the plane 
of Maria Rossetti's " Shadow of Dante," or J. H. Sy- 
monds's " Introduction to the Study of Dante." Of the 
latter work, by the way, a new edition (the fourth) has 
just been published (Macmillan), at the instance of 
Mr. Horatio F. Brown, the author's literary executor. 

The " Eversley " form of book, which was devised 
by the Messrs. Macmillan many yean ago for the 
needs of a new edition of Kingaley, has proved so sat- 



isfactory to the public, that writer after writer has re- 
appeared in its tasteful dress, and no small part of the 
best English literature is now obtainable in the volumes 
of this design. We need mention only the names of 
Arnold, Church, Gray, Huxley, Lamb, Milton, Morley, 
and Wordsworth, in illustration of the scope of the 
series. At present, a Shakespeare is being added, 
under the editorship of Mr. C. 11. Herford, whose notes 
and introductions are scholarly and brief. There are 
to be ten volumes in all, of which five have now ap- 
peared. They are a little thicker than is usual with 
this series, but still most convenient to handle, and will, 
we doubt not, become very popular. 

A new edition, with an enlarged glossary of Sanscrit 
terms, of " Vedanta Philosophy," has just been pub- 
lished by the Baker & Taylor Company. The frontis- 
piece is a portrait of the author, the Swami Vivekananda, 
so well known to the attendants upon the Congress of 
Religions in 1893. The book is too well known to re- 
quire further comment, and the present edition will 
meet a growing demand for authentic information of 
this sort. 

The "Cumulative Book Index," published at Min- 
neapolis by Messrs. Morris & Wilson, appears in a 
double number for April and May. It covers a period 
of sixteen months, and makes a volume of between three 
and four hundred pages. In other words, it is a com- 
plete card catalogue, by author, title, and subject, of all 
the books published in this country from January, 1898, 
to the date of the present issue. The usefulness of such 
a publication needs no explanation. 

Consul-General Wildman's "Tales of the Malayan 
Coast" (Lothrop Pub'g Co.) were gathered during his 
three years' consular service in the Malay Peninsula. 
The tales are seventeen in number, and include such 
titles as " Baboo's Good Tiger," " A Fight with Illanum 
Pirates," "The White Rajah of Sarawak," King Solo- 
mon's Mines," " The Sarong," " The Kris," " Amok," 
" Busuk," " A Pig Hunt on Mt. Ophir," and ' A Croco- 
dile Hunt." Many of them are exciting, some are blood- 
curdling, and all derive interest from their portrayals of 
a quarter of the globe regarding which we were in so 
profound (and perhaps blissful) ignorance a year ago. 

Dr. Fred Morrow Fling, of the University of Ne- 
braska, whose helpful pamphlets of source extracts for 
the scientific study of history have frequently been com- 
mended to our readers, has just published (Lincoln: 
Miller) a little volume, entitled " Outline of Historical 
Method," designed to help the progressive teacher to 
some acquaintance with the methods of modern histor- 
ical scholarship. It is a clear analysis of the work of 
M. Seignobos and Herr Bernheim, intended to bring 
the methods of historical criticism and research within 
the range of the untrained teacher, and deserves a wide 
circulation. 

The little hand-book on " English Meditative Lyrics " 
(Curts & Jennings) is a companion to a similar volume 
from the same pen on similar productions in America. 
The professor of English in Princeton, Dr. Theodore W. 
Hunt, has again shown his faculty for saying much that 
is suggestive in little space, and perhaps no work of 
recent years so ably provokes the reader to better ac- 
quaintance with the lovely verses to which reference is 
had. The book will serve for the novice and for the 
critic equally, the groupings being as useful to the lat- 
ter as the large amount of information must be to the 
former.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL, BOOKS. 



As we predicted some time ago, THE DIAL'S list of 
forthcoming Fall publications, presented herewith, 
eclipses that of any year in the history of the American 
book trade. The number of titles entered is nearly 
1600, against 1350 last year, which latter number was a 
considerable increase over any previous season. These 
lists are therefore a very good index perhaps the best 
that may be had to the condition and progress of the 
publishing business in this country. They are prepared 
in all cases from advance information procured espe- 
cially for the purpose, and represent the output of 62 
publishing firms: the highest number from any one 
firm being 200, and the average 25 for each firm. 
All the books here given are presumably new books 
new editions not being included unless having new form 
or matter ; and the list does not include Fall books 
already issued and entered in our regular List of New 
Books. Juvenile books are, from their great number, 
deferred to another issue. 

The more interesting literary features of this List are 
commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" A Short History of the Progress of Scientific 
Chemistry in Our Own Times," by Dr. William A. 
Tildeu, has just been published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 

" Ten Orations of Cicero, with Selections from the 
Letters," edited by President \V. R. Harper and Mr. 
Frank A. Gallup, is one of the latest publications of the 
American Book Co. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a volume of " Cinq 
Histoires," by MM. Claretie, Dumas, Maupassant, 
Daudet, and Maistre, edited by MM. Baptiste Me"ras 
and Sigmon M. Stern. 

The Moravian Book Concern, of Bethlehem, Pa., will 
publish shortly a book descriptive of travel in Europe 
half a century ago, entitled "Fifty Years After," by 
Mrs. Mary Wiley Staver. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. are the American pub- 
lishers of " A Selection from the Poetical Works of 
James Thomson," as edited by Mr. Bertram Dobell, 
the English publisher, and also one of the closest of 
Thomson's friends. 

The effect of the dramatization of a novel upon the 
sales of the book is strikingly shown in the eases of 
" Rupert of Hentzau " and " The Gadfly," the stage 
representation of which has been attended by a demand 
for a new edition in each case. 

Among American novels that have won success 
abroad is " When Knighthood Was in Flower," which 
has reached its tenth thousand in Canada, and is being 
translated into German. Its sales in this country have 
reached nearly a hundred thousand, those for August 
being the largest since its publication. 

The prospective publication, by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co., of Vicar Thompson's memoir of the great lexi- 
cographer Liddell will be awaited with especial interest 
by lovers of Thackeray. Liddell and Trackeray both 
went to the Charterhouse school, where Liddell some- 
times did Thackeray's Latin exercises for him. Though 
one went to Oxford and the other to Cambridge, they 
remained life-long friends. It was Mrs. Liddell who, 



when " Vanity Fair " was appearing, asked Thackeray to 
let Dobbin marry Amelia, and he answered, "He shall, 
and when he has got her he will not find her worth 
having." 

Mr. George C. Shaw, of Cincinnati, is about to pub- 
lish "The Hesperian Tree: An Annual of the Ohio 
Valley," a work planned and edited by Mr. John James 
Piatt, and containing contributions by such writers as Mr. 
Howells, Mr. James Lane Allen, Mr. R. U. Johnson, 
Mr. Madison Cawein, Mr. John Hay, Miss Helen Hay, 
Mrs. Piatt, and Mrs. Catherwood. The volume will 
extend to four hundred pages, and will be richly fur- 
nished with illustrations. 

The " Rosamund " of Mr. Swinburne's forthcoming 
tragedy is that queen of the Lombards who conspired 
with another to assassinate her husband Albovine, in 
revenge for the wrongs he had done her. The story, 
as told by Machiavelli, is that Albovine (Gibbon's 
Alboiu), after having slain Rosamund's father, forcibly 
married her, and at a banquet compelled her to drink 
from a drinking cup made out of the dead king's skull, 
and pledge Alboviue in a toast. The way in which 
Rosamund compasses this revenge is, in certain essen- 
tial points, different from her method in Middleton's 
play of "The Witch" and also in Alfieri's play on the 
same subject. 

Mr. Robert Clarke, the veteran bookseller and pub- 
lisher of Cincinnati, died in that city August 26, at the 
age of seventy. Mr. Clarke was a native Scotchman, 
who came to Cincinnati in 1840, and in 1858 founded 
the house that has since borne his name and has become 
one of the most widely known and respected book es- 
tablishments in the country. Mr. Clarke was especially 
interested in American history and bibliography, and 
his bookstore was preeminent in this department. He 
himself edited a number of works in this field, and pub- 
lished many more. The business will be continued by 
his former employees and business associates, Messrs. 
Hill, Barney, and Dale.

THE BEE PEOPLE. 



TWO NEW BOOKS A Cnarming . introduction to Natural History for Children. Illustrated. 

BY MISS MORLBY. 



12 mo. $1.25. 

' A work brimming over with joyous, healthy interest. It was written especially for children. So much 
cleverness and literary excellence entitle Miss Morley to a rank among the foremost writers for children." The Beacon, Boston. 

" The bee is credited with powers of reasoning, and the troubles of the queen bee retaining her throne are set forth hi a delightful fairy- 
story-like way which will win every child that reads it." The Philadelphia Tines. 

THE HONEY-MAKERS. 

A Book about Bees from a Scientific and Literary Standpoint. Illustrated. 12mo. $1.5O. 
In "The Bee People" Miss Morley wrote lovingly for young people about bees and their ways. " The Honey-Makers " is intended 
for adults, for lovers of natural history, for apiculturixts, and for all who care to go abroad into the fields to investigate in Nature's sweet- 
smelling laboratory. In the first portion of the book, which deals with the structure, habits, and intelligence of the bee, much curious 
information is collected and many striking observations are given of the work-a-day world and the comedy and tragedy of bee-life. The 
bee holds a time-honored place in the literature of the world, especially in poetry, and Miss Morley has gathered from Hindu poetry, the 
annals of Egypt and the East, the classic pages of Greece and Rome, and mediaeval and Christian literature, a wealth of interesting anecdote 
and allusion. By the Same Author.

THE HOUSE OF THE WIZARD. 

An Historical Romance of the Time of Henry VIII. 12mo. $1.25. 

When " On the Red Staircase " and " An Imperial Lover " appeared, the critics who 
admired the grace of Russian history and the dramatic power in scene and character which 
these novels revealed did not guess the versatility of talent which has led the author to equal success in such widely different fields as the 
Revolutionary days in America, depicted in " A Yankee Volunteer," and life in England in King Henry VIII. 's time, the subject of "The 
House of the Wizard." Readers will find this a strong novel strong in plot, character, and scene. The main interest is furnished by the 
love story of Betty Carew, maid-of-honor to two unhappy queens, and the court life of the period is boldly and vividly portrayed.

" Its dialogue throughout is of the very smartest humorous without obvious effort, epigrammatic without 
apparent contrivance ; the graphic force and picturesqueness of its descriptive matter are no I*BS impressive 
than fascinating ; its delineations of character are alike bold in outline and exquisite in finish." The Daily 
Telegraph (London). 

LUTHER STRONG. 
By Thomas J. Vivian. 12mo, Cloth, $1.25. 

The locality of the story is a hamlet in the Taconic Hills, the ridge of uplands that lies in 
the meeting corners of Vermont, New York, and Massachusetts, where, for truth's sake, the 
novel was planned and written. The atmosphere of the place has got into the book ; indeed, 
it is an open-air story, and the time of the romance from start to finish is only a few weeks, 
but in those weeks are crowded the inception and climax of a catastrophe of " wooing and 
madness." 

In all its hurry and strangeness, however, the principle of cause and effect is never lost 
sight of ; it is the natural progress of events that brings the story to its catastrophe, not the 
machinery of the writer although those who have read Mr. Vivian's " With Dewey at Manila " 
and "The Fall of Santiago," will find that the same vividity of description that marked his 
histories of actualities is here in the drama of his fancies.

About 600 pages. {Ready in October.} Net $3.50 

The object of the author in this work is to portray the history of the determined struggle in East Tennessee 
for the preservation of the Union, and to set forth the unyielding constancy and the heroic sacrifices of the Union 
people in its behalf. No such splendid record of patriotic devotion can be found in our National annals. The 
author has had peculiar opportunities for describing the thrilling incidents connected with the war. He knew all 
the leading men, and most of them intimately. A native of East Tennessee himself, he is familiar with all the 
ways and habits of the people he describes.

The object of this history is the portrayal of the group of strong, brave men who appeared in 1861 as the

iron determination have been found as within this small region of country.

By Mrs. ARCHIBALD DIXON. 8vo. Over 600 pages, 
uniform with recent editions of the works of Jeffer- 
son, Hamilton, etc $4.00 

The writer's purpose is to set forth the origin, the attendant 
circumstances, and the consequences of a measure the enact- 
ment of which proved the most momentous and far-reaching 
event in American annals. The volume comprises more than 
600 large octavo pages, and we do the author but justice when 
we say that none of these pages could be spared. N . Y. -Sun. 
This volume tells the story of a great epoch and epoch- 
maker in American history. It aopears peculiarly timely just 
at this crisis of our national development. Mrs. Dixon's book 
will appeal to the student of history, and as a contribution to 
the literature of a generation before the war will find place in 
our public and private libraries. As a depository of facts, 
passions, and sentiments of the past, and a vivid reflection of 
the spirit of the South in slavery days, it will be an invaluable 
record. New York Times.

less spirit, largely aspiring, often surging toward dangerous 
social theories, demands well-studied, temperate effort to 
make the best of its aspir-ttions and to avoid its dangers."

THIS Book shows that all that is excellent in this earth we owe to the genius of a people 
whose name is so constantly used as a term of reproach. The volume opens with 
Christopher Columbus and the part the Spanish Jews took in the discovery of America. It 
narrates the Pre- Revolutionary Settlements of the Jews, and the thrilling story of their fight 
for civil and religious liberty in America. The reader will see at a glance the number and 
distribution of the Jews over the world, whilst the growth of the Jewish population in the 
United States forms a separate chapter.

WITH thrilling narrative the author portrays the relentless and diabolical persecutions of 
the Jews, and yet they were never wanting in patriotism. Wherever, the world over, 
the Jew found a friend in his country, the country found a friend in him. Whenever the 
safety of their country was imperiled, they rallied round the flag. A book of facts, not opinions. 
The Jews as American patriots ; from the first organized movements for separation from 
England ; through the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican, Civil and Spanish- 
American Wars, Jews freely sacrificed their fortunes and fearlessly gave their lives for their 
country. The book contains the names of Jews who have achieved distinction in the wars of 
the Republic.

BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS. 

MPL> TTL^Afllf PATTP This novel opens with a graphic description of a German emigrant ship, 
IL.IV I\.rVVJIW I f\ I L^. between Harobunc and New York, raking across the waters of the Atlantic 
Ocean. It describes the life on ship- board, the heaving sea, the rocking atrip, the whittling winds, the yo ho of the aeamen, 
and the sea-sickness of the immigrants. The author selects two persons from the mass of immigrants, Lorenz Toporek 
and his daughter Mary, who thenceforward figure throughout the book. They make a home in Arkansas and their expe- 
riences in that Southern State are recited at length with graphic power, and not a little satiric wit. The strange people 
they meet, the unwonted environment, in brief, the new world they find themselves precipitated into with all their old- 
world inheritances and habits still upon them, are described at full length, in a series of chapters at once amusing and 
dramatic. Border life, with all its contrasts, is depicted, and at last a denouement, somber and sorrowful, is reached. 
The reader upon closing this novel will pronounce it one of the most fascinating in literature. 

CO DITNIQ THP \A/OI?I D The perennial popularity of the author of "Quo Vadis" imparts 
OW IV ^ 1^10 r WIVi-.l-'. a value to everything that comes from the pen of its gifted author 

independently of the merit of the production. This work, however, has merit enough to stand upon its own basis, and 
would itself make a reputation. Its peculiar value is, that it shows the versatility of Sienkiewicz ; it affords specimens of 
his style, in the difficult art of short story writing ; and it also presents some magnificent illustrations of his rare dramatic 
power. His play, in part fifth of this bonk, entitled " WIN OR LOSE," compares favorably in life and glow with 
" Cyrano de Bergerac." The readers of " QUO VADIS " have a rare treat awaiting them in this volume.

men and women who think and speak and act, in harmony with nature and life as we see them around us, in an enchanting 

tumult from day to day. This author has the rare gift of making the inanimate speak, of painting the animate so true 

to the facts that we seem to know and keep company with his characters from the beginning to the end of the novel.

1 bIW ' WIS,L,L70 mL,L, I . It not generally known that this great writer was in this 
country a few years ago. While here, his eyes and imagination were busy, and this graphic work is the result of that 
visit. We have here a striking description of experiences in the Southwest and in California. The poet, the dramatist, 
and the novelist are blended in one in these pages. The author is not always as complimentary as patriotic Americans 
might desire ; but being foreign, he sees and judges from a foreign standpoint, on the principle of Burns' lines : 

" O wad iome power the gif tie gie us, 
To see onraeU M 'it her* Me u*." 

The American reader may be profited by the perusal of these strictures. Whatever we may think of his conclusions, there 
is no denying the charm and interest of his portrayal of American life and manners.

changed situation in the Catskills, was not greater than the astonishment of this Polish soldier when he viewed the situa- 
tion and succumbed to the inevitable upon coming back to his native land. As with all of this author's writings, so here 
we find the wealth of imagination and power of insight into human nature, and a dramatic fire which makes his works 
universally popular and will undoubtedly endow them with immortality.

ESTHER WATERS," by GEORGE MOORE. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This is the first authorised edition of Mr. Moore's great novel which has been published In America. He has thoroughly revised 
the book and added an Introduction. It is believed that in this form the story will be found worthy of a place In public and private 
libraries. 

JUST ABOUT A BOY," by W. S. PHILLIPS (El Comancho). 16mo, cloth, $1.26. 

The story of a boy's life out of doors ; it is a book that will delight all lovers of nature. 

MARSHFIELD THE OBSERVER," by EGBRTON CASTLE, author of " The Pride of Jennico," 
"Young April," etc. 12mo, cloth, 91.50. 

This is a volume of short stories which show the same striking ability that marks Mr. Castle's earlier books. It is likely to obtain 
a very wide sale. 

SAN ISIDRO," by MRS. SCHUYLER CROWNINSHIELD. 12mo. cloth, $1.50. 

A romance of the early part of the century In the West Indies. It shows all the vivid coloring of the Islands and scenes in which 
Mrs. Crownlnshleld is so much at home. 

THE RELIGION OF TO-MORROW," by REV. FRANK CRANE. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

A series of essays on religion from a rational point of view. A book for serious readers. 

LE5SER DESTINIES," by SAMUEL GORDON. 12mo. cloth. $1.25. 

A story of the East End of London. Not perhaps as unpleasant as " Tales of Mean Streets," but with much of the same forceful- 
ness and knowledge. 

SPANISH PEQQY," by MARY HARTWELL CATHERWOOD. 4to, cloth, illustrated by J. C. Leyen- 
decker. 92 00. 

A story of young Abraham Lincoln and his life in New Salem, Illinois. A pretty, romantic love story which will serve as an admirable 
book for Christmas and the Holidays. 

THE GREATEST AMERICAN ORATIONS," edited by ALONZO BEACH GOWER. 8vo, buck- 
ram, 92.00. 

Mr. Oower has collected in one large volume of over six hundred pages the greatest orations delivered In America. Up to now 
there has been no handy edition, and the present volume will go far to supply a want which ha* been felt in llbrarie* and schools. 



1899.] THE DIAL 221 

HERBERT S. STONE & COMPANY. 

" FABLES IN SLANG," by GEORGE ADE, author of "Artie," "Doc' Home," and "Pink Marsh." 
18mo, cloth, with twenty-five full-page illustrations by Clyde J. Newman, $1.00. 

Mr. Ade has not yet written a book that has failed to make a splendid success. This new volume is likely to outdo all of his other 
work in popularity. It is very modern, very wise and full of humor. 

" HENRY IRVING ELLEN TERRY," a book of portraits by GORDON CRAIG. 4to, boards, $1.00. 
Also an edition of one hundred copies printed on special paper, bound in cloth, $3.50. 

Mr. Gordon Craig (Miss Terry's son) has for some time been known in England as a clever artist of the Nicholson school. His work 
is extremely simple and brilliant. He has made portraits of his mother and Sir Henry in their best known parts. The pictures are all 
reproduced in color. 

"LOVE MADE MANIFEST," by GUT BOOTHBT, author of "Dr. Nikola," etc. 12mo, cloth, illus- 
trated by Lucy Kemp- Welch, $1.25. 

Mr. Boothby is already too well known to need any introduction here. His new story is as thrillingly interesting as anything he 
has done. 

" WAS IT RIGHT TO FORGIVE ? " by AMELIA E. BARR, author of "A Bow of Orange Ribbon," 
etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Mrs. Barr considers this new novel as quite the best of her recent works. It is characterized by the same skillful handling and 
interesting love story that have made her other books popular. 

" MY FATHER AND I," by the COUNTESS DE PULIGA. 12mo, cloth, with several portraits, $1.25. 

This is not a translation. It is essentially a book for daughters, being the story of a girl's up-bringing by her father and their long 
relationship of charming love and trust. The Countess de Puliga is the daughter of the Count d'Orsay. 

RESOLVED TO BE RICH," by EDWARD H. COOPER. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Mr. Cooper achieved considerable reputation through his brilliant story entitled "The Marchioness Against the County." Since 
then he has published a book of short stories only. This new novel is likely to give him a firm position before the reading public. 

A MODERN READER AND SPEAKER." Adapted to schools and colleges and containing the 
most representative collection of pieces suitable for public recital, by GEORGE RIDDLE. 12mo, buckram, 
$1.50. 

It is unlikely that any man in this country is better suited to undertake the task of preparing a reader and speaker than Mr. George 
Riddle. His long experience before the public has enabled him to choose the most popular pieces, while his own excellent taste and 
judgment have given dignity to the work. 

" ROSE ISLAND," by W. CLARK RUSSELL. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

It is almost needless to say that Mr. Russell's new book deals with love and adventure at sea. It is perhaps worth while mention- 
ing, however, that " Rose Island " is fully worthy of the author of " The Wreck of the Grosvenor. " 

-THE WONDERFUL STORIES OF JANE AND JOHN," by GERTRUDE SMITH, author of 
"Arabella and Ariminta." 4to, cloth, with many illustrations in color by Alice Woods, $1.50. 

" SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN." His life story, with letters and reminiscences, by Arthur Lawrence. 
8vo, cloth, with many illustrations, $3 50. 

This is the authorized biography of the great composer. It has been prepared under his personal supervision and revised by him 
in proof. It contains many of his letters and much intimate personal matter of great interest. 

"THE PERILS OF JOSEPHINE," by LORD ERNEST HAMILTON, author of " The Outlaws of the 
Marches." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

A novel which once begun is not likely to be dropped until finished. 

THE INDIANS OF TO-DAY," by GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL. 4to, buckram, with fifty full-page 
portraits of the most famous chiefs and four pictures in colors, $5.00. Also a special limited edition of 
one hundred copies on hand-made paper, $10.00 net. 

It is generally acknowledged that Mr. Grinnell is the authority on American Indians. For the first time in many years a serious 
attempt is made to deal fairly with the Indian of to-day : his past, his present conditions, and his future chances. The book is illus- 
trated with a remarkable series of photographs, taken by Mr. F. A. Rinehart during the Congress of Indians at the Omaha Exposition. 

"THE SEEKERS," by STANLEY WATERLOO, author of "The Story of Ab," "The Wolf's Long 
Howl," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Waterloo has written a powerful novel dealing with some phases of the Christian Science movement. It is in a way, perhaps, 
to be compared with " The Damnation of Theron Ware," and is certain to provoke wide discussion and criticism. 

"TWO GENTLEMEN IN TOURAINE," by RICHARD SUDBURY. 8vo, cloth, with many full-page 
illustrations, reproduced in photogravure, $5.00 net. 

A delightful account of the wanderings of an American gentleman and a member of the French nobility through the historical 
chateaux in Touraine. It gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the famous people who lived in them, and admirable 
descriptions of the country. It is a book suited for the holidays and for general reading. 

"THE HUMAN INTEREST," a study in incompatibilities, by VIOLET HUNT. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

A light and very amusing novel, written in a brilliant epigrammatic style. It is in no sense a problem story, and is intended for 
entertainment alone.

RELIOIO PICTORIS. 

By HELEN BIQELOW MERRIMAN, author of " What 
Shall Make Us Whole ? " 12mo, 91.50. 
Mrs. Merriraan's previous book attracted marked atten- 
tion. The present book is an attempt to show, from the 
standpoint of the artist, the fundamental unity between things 
material and spiritual, and that the secret of life is to be found 
in the relation and interaction of these. The book deals with 
the problems of life and religion in a profound and illuminat- 
ing way and with a deeply reverent spirit, and is well fitted 
to inspire and lead those who find little comfort in formal 
creeds. 

BETTY LEICESTER'S CHRISTMAS.

and other illustrations. Square 1'Jino, 81.00.

garet Kent." With a decorative cover and other 
illustrations. IGmo, 81.25. 

This is a companion volume to Mrs. Kirk's delightful 
" Dorothy Deane," which was so popular last year. It tells 
what happened to Dorothy after she went to live near New 
Tork and how Marcia grew up. Dorothy's old friends are in 
this story, and half a dozen new ones, and Mrs. Kirk tells 
what very interesting times are had. The book is charming 
inside and outside. 

AN UNKNOWN PATRIOT. 
By FRANK SAMUEL CHILD. Illustrated. 12 mo, 81.50.

cut during the Revolution. Nathan Hale was known to the

Admiral Davis was one of the most noteworthy of the men 
who have held high rank in the American navy. His great 
services in the Union War, his successful career as Superin- 
tendent of the Naval Observatory, are here recounted, and 
much light is thrown on the superb system of training and 
discipline which has won for the navy its proud history. 

THE END OF AN ERA. 
By JOHN S. WISE. 12mo, 92.00. 
The era here described is that which for the Southern 
States came to an end with the surrender of General Johnston 
to General Sherman in 1865. The author is the son of Gov. 
Henry A. Wise of Virginia, and he describes antebellum life 
in Virginia, its social charm and its peculiar characteristics, 
the excitement of the John Brown invasion, and his observa- 
tions and experience during the Civil War. His book gives a 
remarkably vivid and accurate inside view of the Confederate 
States, and is at onoe very valuable and interesting.

girls who were pupils in her school.

FRENCH POETRY AND ENGLISH. 

The subject of the comparative merits and 
capabilities of the French and English lan- 
guages as media for poetical expression comes 
up periodically in the literary journals, and 
appears to be as far from settlement as ever. 
In its modern critical phase, the discussion 
seems to have found its starting-point in that 
puzzling final chapter of Taine's " English Lit- 
erature," which makes an elaborate comparison 
between Musset and Tennyson, and returns a 
verdict in favor of the French poet. " I pre- 
fer Alfred de Musset to Tennyson," were the 



words with which Taine closed the chapter, and 
for many years his English critics refused to 
take such a dictum seriously, setting it down 
rather summarily as one of those aberrations 
of judgment into which the best of men are 
apt to be betrayed by the conditions of their 
own milieu and moment. No doubt the char- 
acterization of " In Memoriam " as " cold, 
monotonous, and often too prettily arranged " 
lent color to the assumption that the French 
critic was incapable of feeling what Tennyson 
meant to his English readers, and that his 
preference for Musset was nothing more than 
an illustration of racial prejudice. After all, 
Taine was a Frenchman, poor thing, and could 
not be expected to know any better. These 
words would fairly sum up the undercurrent 
of feeling that ran beneath the various polite 
phrases with which his bizarre opinion was 
glanced at and dismissed. 

The subject being thus brought into the 
forum of discussion, a great many English 
writers were found to hold a similar view, and 
it got to be a sort of critical commonplace to 
say that, while French prose was an unsurpass- 
able form of expression, French poetry was not 
to be compared with English, that the French 
language was incapable of- scaling the higher 
peaks of poetical sublimity, or of sounding the 
deeper harmonies of song. The weight of 
Matthew Arnold's authority was added to this 
concurrence of lesser opinion, and the question 
seemed to be settled. Moreover, who but an En- 
glishman could enter into the spirit of English 
poetry, and how presumptuous it was for French- 
men, one of the most distinguished of whom had 
called Shakespeare " a drunken savage," to pre- 
tend to understand it. As for the ability of an 
Englishman to see all that there was in French 
poetry, and to expose the hollowness of its pre- 
tensions, that was quite another matter. Mat- 
thew Arnold, we are told, was fond of quoting 
French Alexandrines followed by Shakespear- 
ian verses, whereupon he would exclaim " What 
a relief " ! Now, with all due respect for this 
great critic, such a method of comparison 
proves nothing more than the possession of a 
fatuous national self-sufficiency on the part of 
the writer who makes use of it, and the fact 
that a French critic would reverse the process, 
and feel equally relieved by the Alexandrine 
cadence, is all the answer that such an argument

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



needs. The ideal method of dealing with the 
dispute would probably be its reference to a 
court of arbitration composed, say, of Russians 
and Hungarians equally familiar with both 
French and English, if such might be found. 
In the matter of mutual comprehension and 
appreciation, both French and English criti- 
cism have advanced, of late years, far beyond 
the point at which it was possible for a French- 
man to ignore English literature altogether, 
and for an Englishman to assume complacently 
the entire superiority of his own poetry over 
that of his neighbor across the Channel. There 
have been too many careful studies of English 
literature by French critics, and too many in- 
terpreters of French poetry to English readers 
for either of these provincial positions to be 
maintained, and it is highly significant that a 
recent volume of essays by Professor W. P. 
Trent should again take up the question of 
Tennyson and Musset, this time to refer to it 
in the following language : ' To those of us 
who have been allowed to see the error of our 
way through our reading of Hugo, Leconte de 
Lisle, and Musset himself, who have learned 
to our surprise that much of what our teachers 
had told us about the insufficiency of the 
French language to the expression of high po- 
etic thought and sentiment was due to mere 
ignorance on their part, a doubt has perhaps 
come more than once whether Taine was not 
partly justified in his preference for Musset 
over Tennyson." This passage is significant 
simply because it abandons the old arrogant 
English attitude, and evinces a disposition to 
reopen the question once thought to be closed, 
to reexamine it in an enlightened spirit and 
with a candid mind. Mr. Trent by no means 
claims to reverse the former decision, but he 
does go so far as to say that " it is certainly 
permissible for those who care for the lyrical 
expression of intense passion to maintain that 
they find little or nothing in Tennyson that takes 
the place for them of Musset's chief poems." 

" C'est cette TOIZ da ccenr qoi Male an ooenr arrive, 
Que nul antra, aprfa toi, ne nous rendra jamais." 

The whole general subject of French and 
English poetry has been under discussion by a 
variety of pens during the past three months 
in the pages of "The Saturday Review," and 
it is not often that the " silly season " of En- 
glish journalism gets hold of so interesting a 
theme. The discussion was started by the 
irrepressible ** Max," apropos of Mme. Bern- 
hardt's "Hamlet," and for once this humming- 
bird critic plunged his beak into the very heart 



of the blossoms among which he was disporting. 
Complaining that "Paix, paix, nine troublee ! " 
for example, was entirely inadequate to repro- 
duce the " Rest, rest, perturbed spirit ! " of the 
original which is undoubtedly true he said : 
"The fact is that the French language, limpid and 
exquisite though it is, affords no scope for phrases which, 
like this phrase of Shakespeare's, are charged with a 
dim significance beyond their meaning and with re- 
verberations beyond their sound. The French language, 
like the French genius, can give no hint of things 
beyond those which it definitely expresses. For ex- 
pression, it is a far finer instrument than our language ; 
but it is not, in the sense that our language is, suggest- 
ive. It lacks mystery. It casts none of those purple 
shadows which do follow and move with the moving 
phrases of our great poets." 

With these observations the train was fired 
that led to a series of veritable explosions of 
opinion on the part of correspondents of the 
paper, and the discussion which was thus evoked 
is not yet ended, for every week brings to it 
some further contribution. 

First of all, another "M. B." rallied to the 
defense of the language thus attacked, denied 
the charges in toto, and quoted various pas- 
sages which were certainly not lacking, to a 
properly attuned ear, in the quality of mys- 
terious suggestiveness. " I maintain," said the 
writer, " that Racine's lines 

' Ariane, ma soeur, de qnel amour blentie, 
Votu mouiutes aux borda ou voua lutes laissle ! ' 

Are quite as suggestive as * Rest, rest, per- 
turbed spirit! " We, for one, will not deny 
the haunting quality of the couplet, which casts 
shadows quite as purple as those of the Shake- 
spearian phrase brought into comparison. This 
writer closed his letter with a felicitous revival 
of the old " Punch " story about the little girl 
and her nurse. " And you must know, Parker, 
that in France they say Wee for Yes." "La! 
Miss," answered the nurse, "how paltry!" 

The letter above described at once excited 
the combative instincts of Professor Tyrrell, 
who rushed into the fray with the argument 
that French is " an essentially emasculated 
tongue, in fact, pigeon-Latin." Had the Dub- 
lin professor been content to leave his argu- 
ment unsupported by examples, all might have 
been well, but in an unfortunate moment he 
added : " When a Frenchman says a girl is 
4 beaucoup belle' he is using Latin as a Chinese 
would be using English if he called her 4 good- 
whack good.' " The week following this several 
further communications appeared, but the main 
subject was for the moment forgotten in the 
opportunity offered to say cutting things about 
Professor TyrrelTs " beaucoup belle." As one

writer remarked, " An Englishman who said 
this would be treated to the courtesy due to 
strangers, but a Frenchman would be prepar- 
ing for himself an unhappy manhood and a 
friendless old age." After this interlude the 
original theme was again taken up, and illu- 
minated, during successive weeks, by an array 
of views and pertinent quotations that were 
unfailing in their interest. 

It may be said that such a discussion leads to 
nothing, which is in one sense true ; but in 
another sense we must say that it leads to a 
greater catholicity of temper and openness of 
mind, thus accomplishing a highly useful pur- 
pose. But the old misconception of French 
poetry as incapable of sounding the depths of 
the spiritual life is one that dies hard. We 
have never seen, on the whole, an abler plea for 
this view than was contained in a leading ar- 
ticle published last year in " Literature." 
" There are two great ways," we were told, 
" by which men and nations may guide their 
thought ; the way of materialism, and the way 
of mysticism. Surely we may sum up the 
whole discussion by saying that the French 
nation has chosen the former, and that the 
French language reflects the limitations of the 
materialistic position." Surely? Let this con- 
tention be met by Victor Hugo. 

" Ne possede-t-il pastoute la certitude? 
Dieu ne remplit-il pas ce monde, notre e'tude, 

Du nadir an ze'uith ? 

Notre sagesse aupies de la sienne est de'mence. 
Et n'est-ce pas it, lui que la clarte* commence, 

Et que 1'ombre finit? 

" D'ailleurs, pensons. Nos jours sont des jours d'amertume, 
Mais, quand nous tendons les bras dans cette brume, 

Nous sentons une main ; 

Quand nous mflrchons, coin-he's, dans 1'ombre du martyre, 
Nons entendons quelqu'un derriere nous nous dire : 

C'est ici le chemin." 

Again, "French literature must have no strange- 
ness in the proportion, no vague epithets that 
hint of worlds unseen and unsuspected secrets." 
But what of M. de Heredia's magical verses 
upon the companions of Columbus: 

" Chaque soir, espdrant des lendemains e'piques, 
L'azur phosphorescent de la mer des Tropiques 
Enchantait leur sommeil d'un mirage doi6 ; 
Ou, pench^s <\ 1'avaut des blanches caravelles, 
Us regardait monter en un ciel ignore" 
Du fond de I'Oce'an des e'toiles nouvelles." 

Our writer concludes with these eloquent 
words : " Our debate is not of what is true, 
but of what is beautiful ; the artist cannot 
hesitate between the sacramental words and 
the chemical formula, and it must be said 
again and again that from the French ports 
no ship sails into faery lands forlorn. French 
literature is the most delightful garden in 



the world ; but the neat hedges of that gay 
parterre shut in the view, and no man stand- 
ing by the bosky arbors can behold the vision 
of Monsalvat or the awful towers of Carbonek 
far in the spiritual city." The beauty of these 
words is obvious, and equally obvious their 
sincerity; yet thought of the work of Hugo 
alone is sufficient for their refutation. There 
is no note of music that he has not struck, no 
chord of the life of the soul that has not sounded 
from his lyre. The lyric rapture of " Le 
Chasseur Noir " and " Un Peu de Musique " 
is essentially one with the lyric rapture of 
Shelley, and above this height the wings of 
song may not be borne. The superiority of 
English poetry over French is in its quantity 
rather than in its quality. It may fairly be 
admitted that Shakespeare and Milton and 
Shelley and Tennyson outweigh Racine and 
Hugo and Musset and Leconte de Lisle, but 
only those who are " tone-deaf " to the music 
of French verse and untouched by the sub- 
tleties of its emotional suggest! veness can 
maintain that it never soars to the highest 
plane of imaginative beauty and spiritual 
insight. 

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE USES OF THE BOOK REVIEW. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the September " Atlantic " I find a readable arti- 
cle by Mr. J. S. Tunison on the Book Review. " What 
is the value of the book review ? " is the problem Mr. 
Tunison sets himself to solve; and he goes on to solve 
it in the necessarily rather discursive and Delphic fash- 
ion imposed on a man who has several pages of space 
to fill, and cannot, therefore, content himself with a 
plain answer to a plain question. Let me try to give a 
plain answer to Mr. Tunison's plain question. What is 
the value (or use) of a book review ? Why, precisely 
that which any description or characterization of a new 
thing offered for sale to the public has: it sets forth 
what the new thing specifically is, and helps the reader 
to judge whether or no the new thing is one which he, 
the reader, wants badly enough to buy. Ask us (or 
yourself) something harder, Mr. Tunison. Of course 
if the reviewer chooses to throw in his personal opinion 
of the worth of the new thing, and even to expand him- 
self a little on topics mooted by his author, well and 
good. We, the subscribers, don't grudge him his little 
literary fling; but it is primarily his exposition that we 
want, and that we impliedly contract for when we sub- 
scribe for his journal. We take his journal as a guide to 
the book-market. 

Among Mr. Tunison's acquaintances, he tells us, is a 
publisher who declares that " No review ever sold a 
book." This " acute " man, it seems, argues it out as 
follows: There are some books (like " Ben-Hur") that 
have sold well though neglected by reviewers; there 
are some other books that have sold well though 
" roasted " by reviewers; ergo, " No review ever sells a 



230

book." Logical man I I suppose be would argue, also: 
Some sick men have gotten well without the aid of a 
doctor; some other sick men have gotten well though 
given up by the doctor; ergo, No doctor ever helped a 
sick man to get well. No review ever sold a book ! 
Alas, how much richer (in coin, at least) would the 
present writer be were that dictum a true one ! The 
man given to buying more books than he can afford, 
who subscribes to a Review, deliberately courts danger 
and woos his besetting sin. \\ | g

THE CIVIL WAR AND NATIONAL 

SOVEREIGNTY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The communication in THE DIAL for September 16, 
from Mr. . Parmalee Prentice, concerning the treatise 
of himself and Mr. Egan on " The Commerce Clause 
of the Federal Constitution," discloses that the change 
which he thinks the Federal Constitution has exper- 
ienced with respect to the question of nationality is a 
change not in law but in fact. In other words, there 
have been in the past dissents upon the subject among 
those whose views and actions should bave been gov- 
erned by the decisions of the courts. Those decisions 
have themselves consistently sustained the nationality 
of the Federal Government The dissenters bave at 
last yielded to the views of the majority, and all now 
agree upon the theory of nationality ; and this change 
of opinion on the part of the minority is what the 
authors think has caused the United States to be "com- 
pletely established as a national government." Giving 
this view full consideration, it seems to me tbat it jus- 
tifies the suggestions in my review. Those who read 
the review will remember tbat the work was treated 
by me as a legal essay, intended primarily for lawyers. 
I do not discover upon the face of the treatise that the 
authors have limited their views upon this subject to 
the fact of dissent from the decisions of the courts. 
The quotations from the book, made in the review, 
were found under the headings, " Change in Theory of 
Constitutional Construction " and " The Application of 
the Doctrine of State's Rights," the implication being 
plain tbat the theories advanced were legal proposi- 
tions. If the authors agree that the changes they dis- 
cover were not variations or vacillations in the course 
of constitutional decision, should not this circumstance 
have been made plain upon the face of a legal treatise ? 

But if we distinguish history from jurisprudence, 
and take the views of the authors as applicable to our 
history, is it just to treat the dissent from the decisions 
of the courts, which is merely agitated but does not 
prevail, as constituting any change in fact, even in our 
constitutional history ? Mr. Prentice says that " before 
the war the Southern theories of construction had suc- 
ceeded in depriving the Federal Government of many 
national attributes ; " that whatever had been the legal 
relations between the States and the Federal Govern- 
ment, before the war, " they were certainly not estab- 
lished in fact as they were afterward ; " and that, until 
the war disposed of secession, " State sovereignty was 
more thought of than National sovereignty." Are 
these suggestions to be written down as a part of our 
constitutional history ? I know of no warrant, either 
in fact or in law, for such statements. To argue that 
these features distinguish our constitutional history 
before the Civil War, and tbat therefore that war his- 
torically established the nation, is in my view to mis- 



take cause and effect. Those who participated in the 
struggle for the maintenance of the Constitution and 
the Union will surely agree with me in the view, not 
that nationality resulted as a fact because of the issue 
of the Civil War, but that the people put duwn the 
insurrection of 1861 in reliance upon and by virtue of 
the fact that, as the Supreme Court decided in 1793 
and always subsequently held, the United States be- 
came a Nation under and by virtue of the Constitution. 
"The relations between the States and the Federal 
Government" were so thoroughly established by law, 
that the illegal attempt to sunder those relations proved 
a failure.

AN APPEAL FOR NURSERY RHYMES AND 

JINGLES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A short time ago you were good enough to print a 
request from me for American variants of the " Mother 
Goose Rhymes and Jingles." This request has bad a 
somewhat unexpected and unlooked-for result. Instead 
of finding any body of evidence that the old favorites 
have become corrupt, almost the contrary appears to be 
the case, for their purity seems to have been generally 
preserved in quite a remarkable manner; this is prob- 
ably due to the fact that the " Mother Goose Books " 
have been for so many years made so cheaply that there 
can scarcely be found a home, however lowly, where 
there are children without a copy of the received text 
of the famous classic. 

The direct simplicity, the dramatic imagination, the 
vivid fancy, and the free and spontaneous humor of the 
" Mother Goose Rhymes and Jingles " will probably 
never be excelled by any body of modern verse, and will 
doubtless while our language lasts remain " the light 
literature of the infant scholar." 

But since the collection was first printed by Newbery, 
about the middle of the last century, many new verses 
and rhymes and jingles have succeeded in getting a 
foothold in the nursery, from which it would be as hard 
to dislodge them as to oust "Mother Goose" herself: 
such as, for example, some of the inimitable nonsense 
rhymes by Edward Lear, Longfellow's "There Was a 
Little Girl," some of the verses of Eugene Field, Ten- 
nyson, and Stevenson, not to mention many others. The 
kindergarten movement, too, has set many people ac- 
tively to work in writing nursery rhymes and jingles, 
play games, etc., many of them, of course, worthless 
and doomed to perish as the sparks fly upward, but 
some of them, possessing in the main the characteris- 
tics of the " Mother Goose Rhymes," will doubtless be 
perpetuated along with them. 

All this is reflected in the letters which I have re- 
ceived during the past two or three months from cor- 
respondents all over the country, and it is evident that 
the approved literature of the nursery has enormously 
increased during recent years. In making a collection 
of these modern classics of the nursery, it is impossible 
for one person to find out all of those which have taken 
a permanent place in the life of the little ones; and I 
should like to make another appeal to your readers to 
ask them this time to send me the nursery rhymes and 
jingles which are familiar and popular in the nursery, 
but are not to be found in the " Mother Goose " collec- 
tions. CHARLES WELSH.

A FIGHTER FOB THE CONFEDERACY.* 

Dr. John Allan Wyeth's animated account 
of the life and campaigns of that masterful 
character and untutored soldier of genius, 
General N. B. Forrest, is a desirable addition 
to the literature of the Civil War. Forrest's 
reputation was long under a cloud owing to his 
alleged responsibility for the excesses at Fort 
Pillow, and to the conception of him at the 
North as a superior sort of Quantrell who 
fought with little regard for the rules and 
amenities of "civilized warfare" (to use the 
current contradiction in terms) ; and it is well, 
now that the passions engendered by the strug- 
gle have cooled, that Forrest's side of the case 
should be ably and fully presented. This office 
Dr. Wyeth seems to us to have performed ; 
and while his book is one that will probably at 
some points excite controversy, we venture to 
say that no fair-minded Northern man, intelli- 
gent enough to form a liberal and rational 
opinion somewhat at variance with his general 
bias and sympathies, will read it without reach- 
ing the conclusion that the old war-time view 
of Forrest must now be largely revised, and 
that this fearless " fighting leader of fighting 
men " was, all in all, and despite what we at the 
North believe to have been his errors of politi- 
cal judgment and what his biographer admits 
to have been his grave defects of temper and 
training, a man of whose genius, courage, and 
achievements his country at large may now well 
be proud. It should be remembered that when 
the struggle ended in the defeat of the South, 
Forrest was emphatically one of those who ac- 
cepted the issue unreservedly and urged his 
neighbors to do likewise. Oblivion of the old 
order, and loyalty to the new, was the burden 
of his addresses in later years at reunions of 
his former comrades in arms. He honestly 
labored to expel the enmities of strife and the 
bitterness of defeat from his heart ; and when, 
in his last will, he bequeathed his sword to his 
son, he enjoined him to use it, should occasion 
offer, under the flag of the Union with the same 
devotion with which it had been wielded for 
the Southern Confederacy. One may pardon- 
ably conjecture that, had General Forrest lived, 
the close of the war with Spain would have 
found him, like General Joseph Wheeler,

Brothers. 



one of the popular heroes of a re-united nation. 
While Dr. Wyeth did not serve immediately 
under Forrest, he was, during the last two 
years of the war, a private soldier in an Ala- 
bama regiment, four companies of which had 
been transferred from his command. It was 
the enthusiasm of these men for their former 
leader that first awakened his interest in For- 
rest's career and personality, and led to the 
systematic researches of subsequent years, the 
fruits of which are embodied in the present 
volume. Dr. Wyeth has evidently taken great 
pains in collecting and sifting his material ; 
and his book, apart from its biographical inter- 
est, must be pronounced a historical production 
of no mean importance. Its tone, naturally, is 
eulogistic ; and the extremely interesting chap- 
ter on the storming of Fort Pillow is an able 
plea in vindication of Forrest's conduct on that 
deplorable occasion. Nevertheless, Dr. Wyeth's 
tone is not wholly uncritical. In his account 
of battles and campaigns he shows a disposition 
to judge with a measure of impartiality be- 
tween the often conflicting accounts of oppos- 
ing commanders, and he frankly admits the 
latent strain of savagery in Forrest's nature 
which led to acts of violence that were repented 
of in cooler moments, and the memory of which 
undoubtedly shadowed and haunted the Gen- 
eral's declining years. Forrest, Dr. Wyeth 
concedes, " was not an angel by any means "; 
and his hero-worship does not prevent him from 
furnishing evidence enough in support of the 
concession, and in proof of the fact that in 
battle this guerrilla of genius lived up to his 
maxim that " War means fighting, and fighting 
means killing." 

Forrest's remarkable military ability met 
with tardy* recognition from the chiefs of the 
Confederacy. The educated soldiers, graduates 
of West Point, under whom or beside whom he 
served, were slow to perceive, or at all events 
to admit, that this fighting civilian, who could 
not pass a cadet's examination, who knew noth- 
ing of tactics and strategy save what he had 
picked up in the field, was their equal and 
often their superior in the actual practice of 
war. Forrest's very lack of academic training 
made him, in a special way, a peculiarly dan- 
gerous opponent. There was no predicting, in 
the light of the established principles of mili- 
tary science, what he was going to do next ; 
and the Union generals were constantly baffled 
by his erratic movements and hawk-like swoops, 
as the skilled fencer who fights by the book 
may be nonplussed by the furious onset of an

untaught yet a phenomenally strong, swift, 
and resourceful antagonist. Says General 
Sherman, in whose side Forrest was a perpetual 
thorn : 

" I think Forrest was the most remarkable man our 
Civil War produced on either Hide. ... He had never 
read a military book in his life, knew nothing about 
tactics, could not even drill a company, but he had a 
genius for strategy which was original, and to me incom- 
prehensible. ... He always seemed to know what I 
was doing or intended to do, while I am free to confess 
I could never tell or form any satisfactory idea of what 
he was trying to accomplish." 

Jefferson Davis is quoted by the author as 
saying, in reply to Governor Porter of Ten- 
nessee, who had spoken of Forrest as " the first 
cavalry leader of the war" and as historically 
rated as one of the half-dozen great soldiers 
of the country ": 

" I agree with you. The trouble was that the generals 
commanding in the Southwest never appreciated For- 
rest until it was too late. Their judgment was that he 
was a bold and enterprising partisan raider and rider. 
I was misled by them, and 1 never knew bow to measure 
him until I read his reports of his campaign across the 
Tennessee River in 1864. This induced a study of bis 
earlier reports, and after that I was prepared to adopt 
what you are pleased to name the judgment of history." 

General Joseph E. Johnston, the masterly 
strategist, pronounced Forrest the greatest sol- 
dier of the war ; while Lord Wolseley, Forrest's 
most competent foreign critic, says: 

" Panic found no resting-place in that calm brain of 
his, and no danger, no risk, appalled that dauntless 
spirit. Inspired with true military instincts, he was 
verily nature's soldier. It would be difficult to find in 
all history a more varied career than his, a man who, 
from the greatest poverty, without any learning, and 
by sheer force of character alone, became the great 
fighting leader of fighting men, a man in whom an ex- 
traordinary military instinct and sound common-sense 
supplied to a very large extent his unfortunate want of 
military education. His military career teaches us that 
the genius which makes men great soldiers is not to be 
measured by any competitive examination in the science 
of war. In war,' Napoleon said, ' men are nothing; a 
man is everything.' It will be difficult to find a stronger 
corroboration of this maxim than is found in the history 
of General Forrest's operations." 

Forrest was a man of reckless personal daring. 
He was usually in the thickest of the fray, fight- 
ing like a paladin, and inspiring his men by 
word and deed. He never carried a field-glass 
into battle, because his place was at the front. 
He seemed to bear a charmed life, though 
wounded many times. He had, in all, twenty- 
nine horses shot under him ; and it is known 
that he placed thirty Federal officers and sol- 
diers hnrB de combat in hand-to-hand encount- 
ers. Unsparing of himself, he exacted equal 
conduct from his men. Shoot the first man 



that flickers," was his standing order in battle ; 
and he was more than once himself the execu- 
tioner. A believer in Christianity, he showed 
the profoundest respect for its ministers, and 
gave the fullest possible opportunities for re- 
ligious services in camp. Once he greatly 
astonished a captured Federal chaplain (who 
expected short shrift at the bands of " Forrest 
of Fort Pillow ") by not only sending for him 
to dine in his tent, but by reverentially invit- 
ing him to ask the blessing." Next day a 
further surprise awaited the good man. He 
was conducted through the lines and sent on 
his way rejoicing by the General, who humor- 
ously said, in parting, " Parson, I would keep 
you here to preach for me if you were not so 
much more needed on the other side." For- 
rest's respect for the cloth was forcibly mani- 
fested in the case of Bishop Payne, who had 
been invited to preach for the command at 
Tupelo. After service, relates Colonel Kelley, 
most of the officers called on the Bishop at the 
General's tent, and one of them so far forgot 
himself as to give way to his habit of swearing. 

" Forrest became so deeply indignant at the outrage- 
ous conduct of his subordinate that he could scarcely 
contain himself. He took me to one side, and in an 
earnest though low tone said: ' If you think it ought to 
be done, I '11 kick that hog out of the tent." 

Forrest had the vein of dry humor common 
in the Southwest. He once effectually spiked 
the guns of a loquacious widow who asked him 
in company why it was that his beard was still 
black while his hair was turning gray, by reply- 
ing that ' he did not know, unless it was be- 
cause he might have used his brain a little more 
than he had his jaw." 

Forrest was extremely illiterate ; and how 
carefully we should discriminate between illit- 
eracy and ignorance is impressively shown in 
his case. Education of a sort that trains a 
man's powers of action and judgment to the 
highest point of efficiency, he had in full meas- 
ure. But of schooling in the usual sense of the 
term he had little or none. He was one of the 
ablest and most successful men that the South 
in his time had produced ; but it is doubtful 
if he had ever enjoyed even the slender advant- 
ages of the backwoods country school. Born 
in a cedar-log cabin in a remote settlement of 
middle Tennessee, and the son of a poor black- 
smith, Forrest was taken by his family at thir- 
teen to a still ruder region in Mississippi a 
mere wilderness too sparsely settled to afford 
the luxury of a schoolhouse. By sheer native 
force of character he fought his way upward in 



1899.]

civil as in military life. He was by turns far- 
mer, speculator, merchant, broker, and planter. 
When the war broke out he was a rich and 
influential man. While he acquired latterly a 
certain sense of literary style, as is shown in 
his clear and forcible dispatches and in his 
sometimes really eloquent addresses, he never 
quite rid himself of the homely vernacular of 
his boyhood. He always said " mout " for 
might, and " fit " for fought ; and his " Tell 
Bell to move up and fetch all he 's got," is his- 
torical. He spelled as badly as Marlborough 
did. He subscribed himself " Lut Genl "; 
and when he wrote a note of acknowledgment 
to his plucky girl-guide at Black Creek he ex- 
pressed therein his " highest regardes to miss 
Etna Sanson for hir Gallant Conduct," etc. 
Forrest was frankly conscious of his ortho- 
graphical weakness and was chary in the use 
of the pen. " I never see one," he said, " but 
what I think of a snake." It is likely that 
Forrest inherited a large share of his tremen- 
dous energy and imperious temper from his 
mother an Amazonian woman of six feet in 
height, who survived a grapple with a panther, 
and of whom it is related that she soundly 
thrashed, with " four peach-tree switches " cut 
for the purpose, an eighteen-year-old son who 
had just joined the army and declined to soil 
his new '"soldier-clothes" by carrying a sack 
of meal to the mill at her bidding. One is 
not surprised to learn that Mrs. Forrest was 
thought by her neighbors to be rather " set in 
her ways." Had she commanded a brigade at 
the front she would undoubtedly have " shot 
the first man that flickered." 

In his chapter on the Fort Pillow " massacre" 
Dr. Wyeth adduces a good deal of respectable 
evidence tending to clear Forrest of the charges 
brought against him at the North. At this dis- 
tance of time most of us will be free to admit 
the antecedent probability that the excesses at 
Fort Pillow were somewhat exaggerated by the 
Northern authorities and newspapers. We all 
realize pretty clearly just now that the spirit of 
truth does not brood over Washington and sit 
in the soul of the American press in war-time. 
Dr. Wyeth thinks that the finding of the Con- 
gressional Committee upon the Fort Pillow 
affair was a war measure designed to inflame 
and stimulate the North and to damage the 
cause of the South abroad. This view seems 
rather far-fetched, though doubtless the publi- 
cation of the finding was expected to have those 
effects. The Committee probably gave what 
they believed to be an honest verdict on the 



evidence. Such direct testimony as they were 
then able to secure all pointed one way, and 
chimed with their natural preconceptions. Our 
own judgment is that the secret or the solution 
of the terrible Fort Pillow business is to be 
found, not in the character of General Forrest, 
but in the character and composition, the pecu- 
liar relation to each other, of the opposing 
forces. It seems only necessary to point out 
that the defenders of the fort were composed 
of Southern loyalists (_" Tennessee Tories ") 
and runaway negroes, to indicate why the con- 
flict was so bitter and the victors were so ruth- 
less. There is a grim line in Forrest's sum- 
mons to surrender that shows that he foresaw 
and dreaded the scenes that followed the final 
assault : " Should my demand be refused, I 
cannot be responsible for the fate of your com- 
mand." Had the conquered garrison been 
composed of troops from the North there would 
have been no " massacre of Fort Pillow." 

The volume is a presentable one outwardly, 
and contains many portraits of Confederate 
officers. We regret that we must here once 
more enter our old complaint of the lack of an 
index. E. G. J. 



THEORIES OF THE NATION AI, 
CONSTITUTION.* 



The Commentaries on the Constitution of the 
United States, prepared by the late Professor 
John Randolph Tucker, of Washington and Lee 
University, are now published under the editor- 
ship of his son and successor, Professor Henry 
St. George Tucker. They treat seriatim the 
several provisions of that instrument, in a form 
somewhat similar to the commentaries of Judge 
Story. Agreeing in some respects with that 
eminent constitutionalist, Professor Tucker 
differs from him toto coelo in others, notably 
in his theories concerning the process by which 
the nation grew, and the office of the Consti- 
tution in that process. One of the objects of 
this treatise is not only to renew the discussion 
upon that general subject, but to furnish a 
categorical reply to Judge Story's criticisms 
upon the constitutional views advanced by the 
elder St. George Tucker as the editor of Black- 
stone. Thus a portion of this work wears the 
aspect of a family controversy. Professor 
Tucker's style, while often controversial, is

Discussion of its Genesis. Development, and Interpretation.

always so calm and dignified as to appeal 
strongly to the sober thought of his readers. 
He bestows his most elaborate exposition and 
argumentation upon these questions as to the 
" Genesis " of the Constitution ; and to this 
branch of inquiry, as distinguished from the 
Development and the Interpretation of that 
instrument, he appropriates more than one- third 
of his entire space. 

Professor Pomeroy, in his " Introduction to 
American Constitutional Law," enumerates 
three schools of thought concerning the genesis 
of the United States Constitution, namely, the 
National school, the Secession school, and the 
intermediate school which bases the supremacy 
of the Federal government on inter-state com- 
pact. Professor Tucker ignores entirely the 
Secessionist theory, apparently as not entitled 
to consideration in a legal treatise, and sched- 
ules " two leading schools of thought " on the 
subject. The first is the intermediate school of 
Pomeroy's classification, which holds, as stated 
by this devotee of that school, that "the unit 
of sovereignty is the State, which is a Body 
Politic ; that the Constitution of the United 
States is a compact between these sovereign 
units and Bodies-politic, making a Federal 
Union between the States " (v. 1, p. 178). 
The second school, as he well and tersely says, 
" holds that the Union itself is the unit of 
sovereignty, of which the States are subordi- 
nate parts, to which certain powers belong 
under the Constitution of the United States, 
while the main powers belong to the National 
Government" (p. 179). 

Professor Tucker has marshalled very clev- 
erly and forcibly all the arguments which can 
be brought to the support of his theory that 
" the Union is a multiple of units." If that 
theory can be sustained by argument and logic, 
it would seem that he might do it. His elabo- 
rate efforts in that behalf, extending to 140 
pages, will be interesting reading to all stu- 
dents of the constitution-making period in our 
national history. The fatal flaw in the logic 
employed to support the compact theory is 
apparent upon Professor Tucker's pages. 

In his introductory chapters treating gen- 
erally of Sovereignty and the Body-politic, our 
author industriously exposes the fallacy of the 
Social-Compact theory of the basis of govern- 
ment, and adopts the modern American view 
of the rightful sovereignty of the People as a 
Body-politic, distinguished from the govern- 
mental agencies which it employs. In this 
Body-politic is vested " all rightful political 



power over its members for the common good 
of all " (p. 2). It is * the source of all au- 
thority ; the government is the agent or trustee 
it creates and to which it delegates powers " 
(p. 351). This is the constitution-making 
power. A constitution is " the act by which 
the Body-politic constitutes the government 
and delegates and limits its powers " (p. 60). 
" The Body-politic utters its sovereign will 
through the constitution, which calls govern- 
ment into being, organizes its functions, defines 
and limits its powers, and declares to this, its 
creature, by its creative fiat, ' thus far shalt 
thou go but no farther ' " (p. 68). And " this 
principle, the supremacy of the Body-politic as 
constitution- maker, and the subordination of 
the government as the delegated agent of 
the Body-politic, is therefore the foundation 
of American Constitutional Law " (p. 66). 
These extracts are fair samples of the happy 
manner in which our commentator states propo- 
sitions which most of his readers will recognize 
as admirably descriptive of that Body-politic, 
the People of the United States, which, by its 
creative fiat, established the dual system of 
Federal and State governments under the Con- 
stitution of the United States. The larger part 
of his first three chapters might be incorporated 
bodily into a treatise like Story's Commenta- 
ries, in support of the National view of our 
Constitution from which Professor Tucker so 
earnestly dissents. 

Of the supremacy of the government created 
by that Constitution, our author entertains no 
doubt. It is " supreme, within the limits of 
the delegated powers, over all the constitutions 
and laws of the several States, and binding and 
operating upon the citizens of all the States, 
and by its terms, certain rights and privileges 
of the citizens of each are intercommunicated 
to those of every other " (p. 256). And ** this 
supremacy is to be maintained through the 
judicial department of the States and of the 
United States, because it is declared that the 
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, 
that is, in their judicial action they must recog- 
nize the supremacy of the constitution " 
(p. 376). 

From these premises, the logic is not obvious 
by which Professor Tucker reaches his conclu- 
sion that the United States is a " multiple of 
units " (p. 179) ; ** a confederacy by State 
peoples " (p. 287) ; " the multiple of Bodies- 
politic " (p. 802) ; and " a confederation of 
States, but not a new composite, or one new 
civil Body-politic" (p. 818); and that the

Constitution is " a federal compact between 
Bodies-politic" (p. 256). 

What authority could erect, by means of 
the United States Constitution, a frame of 
government which should be supreme over all 
the constitutions and laws of the several States, 
short of a Body-politic, answering Professor 
Tucker's requirements, and composed of the 
People of the United States ? In what smaller 
or more limited Body-politic would it be pos- 
sible for us to see vested " all rightful political 
power over its members for the common good 
of all " the people of the entire United States ? 
The Constitution speaks in the language of 
self-conscious Sovereignty ; why shall we deny 
that in so speaking, " the Body-politic utters 
its sovereign will " ? By what process could 
the thirteen States create a new State, or a new 
governmental agency, greater, for any purposes, 
or to any extent, than themselves ? By what 
process could they authorize the creation of a 
fourteenth State, or any other additional num- 
ber of States, conferring upon those creatures 
equal power, dignity, and sovereignty with 
themselves? How can we attribute to the 
United States of America a sovereignty supe- 
rior to that of any or all of the States, which 
was created by the act of those States ? This 
is impossible, as a result of inter-state compact, 
because it involves the idea of a granting or 
transferring of sovereignty ; and Professor 
Tucker well says that " Sovereignty, as essence, 
is one, indivisible, ungrantable, undistributa- 
ble, and always reserved" (p. 60). Then no 
one of the thirteen Bodies-politic of 1789, if it 
had so desired, could possibly have granted or 
transferred to any new power or State any 
portion of its inherent sovereignty. If, then, 
there were thirteen distinct peoples in 1789, 
which desired to accomplish " a more perfect 
Union " than a League, there was no process 
which they could employ, save for each several 
people to relinquish all its sovereignty, and join 
all the others in forming a new Body-politic, 
the " People of the United States." This is 
the only logical theory deducible from Professor 
Tucker's premises. It was this Body-politic 
which " uttered its sovereign will through the 
Constitution, called government into being, 
organized its functions, defined and limited its 
powers," and declared to each of its creatures, 
Federal and State, " thus far shalt thou go, but 
no farther." On the logic which leads to this 
conclusion, the human mind can rest ; and in 
these principles, " the supremacy of the Body- 
politic as constitution-maker, and the subordi- 



nation of the created governments (Federal 
and State) as the delegated agents of the Body- 
politic," can be seen " the foundations of 
American Constitutional Law." Doubtless 
these considerations, though not expressed by 
him, were in the mind of Chief Justice Marshall, 
when he said, in 1823, in the case of United 
States v. Maurice : 

" The United States is a government, and conse- 
quently a Body-politic and corporate, capable of attain- 
ing the objects for which it was created by the means 
which are necessary for their attainment. This great 
corporation was ordained and established by the Amer- 
ican people." 

The basis upon which Professor Tucker rests 
his support of his compact theory is stated cat- 
egorically by himself. " The written constitu- 
tion of 1789 must be what those who brought 
it into being and gave it the sanction of their 
ratification believed and knew it to be, and 
cannot be changed by what men a century there- 
after choose to think it ought to have been " 
(p. 180). But, suppose the men " who brought 
it into being and gave it the sanction of their 
ratification " did not agree as to just what the 
Constitution was ? Professor Tucker accepts 
the verbal explanation of a portion of those 
men, and rejects the view of others. If there 
were men who then sincerely believed the Con- 
stitution was merely creating another league, 
there were others, equally sincere, whose ver- 
bal explanations of its dominant national fea- 
tures are convincing even now to " men a cen- 
tury thereafter." Our commentator pays no 
regard to the contemporary views, as to the 
nationality embodied in the Constitution, of 
Wilson and Morris and Findlay of Pennsyl- 
vania, and King and Gerry of Massachusetts, 
nor to the opposition raised on this ground by 
Smith of New York and Martin of Maryland. 
He does cite the view of Patrick Henry, that 
the result was " a consolidated National gov- 
ernment of the people of all the States," only 
to report the contrary ideas of several who, in 
replying to Henry, seem to have had an under- 
standing of what our dual system in fact is. 
Among these is Madison, whose view our author 
does not seem to succeed in apprehending, for 
he quotes from that statesman the argument in 
the " Federalist" (No. 39), that the new Consti- 
tution would be in certain respects federal and 
not national, without giving the connoted view 
that in other respects it would be national and 
not federal, nor the conclusion there reached 
that the new government would combine both 
these features and be of a mixed character. It 
must be a similar misapprehension which seeks 



236 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



to draw comfort for the State-compact theory, 
from the writings of Hamilton, who said in the 
'Federalist," that "& Nation without a National 
Government is an awful spectacle " (No. 85) ; 
and that " the streams of national power ought 
to flow immediately from that pure original 
fountain of all legitimate authority," the peo- 
ple (No. 22). This is a fair expression of one 
phase of a Body-politic, such as Professor 
Tucker describes, but composed of the entire 
people of the United States. Both Hamilton 
and Madison seemed to clearly understand that 
a new type of popular government had been 
created, a dual system, possessing both National 
and Federal features. Jefferson, too, as quoted 
by our author, declared to Madison in 1786 : 
" With respect to everything external, we be 
one nation only, firmly hooked together. In- 
ternal government is what each State should 
keep to itself." In a labored argument, the 
commentator seeks to show that the phrase, 
" We, the people of the United States," might 
perhaps have been employed by the constitution- 
makers in the sense of " We, the people of the 
confederated States of New Hampshire, etc., 
not as one civil Body-politic, but as a league" 
(p. 296). But Richard Henry Lee, the " Fed- 
eral Farmer," gave the phrase its simple and 
natural construction when he said, in October, 
1787, " It is to be observed that when the peo- 
ple shall adopt the proposed constitution, it will 
be their last and supreme act; it will be adopted, 
not by the people of New Hampshire, Massa- 
chusetts, etc., but by the people of the United 
States." 

The difficulty with the arguments advanced 
in support of the State-compact theory has 
always been, that they wrest terms from their 
true meaning, and juggle with definitions. The 
system of our Constitution under which the 
Federal government exercises the Supremacy, 
within its appropriate sphere, so distinctly 
stated by Professor Tucker, does not allow to 
the States the enjoyment of " sovereignty " 
within the usual meaning of that term. To 
attempt to assign to the States their true posi- 
tion by any ordinary use of that term, is nec- 
essarily misleading. So, as we have seen above, 
the idea of a supreme Body-politic, such as 
our commentator describes, can be applied only 
to the nation ; and the attempt to place the 
States in the like category can result only in 
confusion of thought. Professor Tucker seems 
to take umbrage at the presumption of Mr. 
von Hoist, a foreigner born, in writing upon 
our constitutional history and criticising our 



statesmen. But his own pages furnish justifi- 
cation of Mr. von Hoist's complaint that Amer- 
ican statesmen have " bonajide, used the same 
word in most opposite senses, and employed 
words as synonymous which denoted ideas abso- 
lutely irreconcilable." 

Bent on subjecting every circumstance to the 
support of his chosen thesis, Professor Tucker 
finds in the declaration of the convention of 
Virginia, on May 15, 1776, in favor "of a 
total separation from the crown and government 
of Great Britain," some evidence of individual 
action as a sovereign State. But Virginia at 
the same time declared for united action of the 
colonies toward independence, reserving to each 
colony the regulation of local and internal con- 
cerns ; and thus, like Maryland, Virginia was 
at the outset of the movement for independence, 
prefiguring the dual system. Again, respecting 
the deed of cession to Congress of the North- 
western lands, made by Virginia in 1784, Pro- 
fessor Tucker argues that Congress was, by its 
acceptance of the deed, estopped to deny that 
Virginia, and not Congress, had theretofore 
" exclusive right of soil and jurisdiction to the 
territory thus ceded "; not considering the fact 
that, in yielding as she did, after a hot discus- 
sion for several years, to the claim of the 
smaller States that only the whole nation had 
a valid title in law to that " right of soil and 
jurisdiction," and thereupon joining in the 
national legislation for the government of that 
territory on a national basis, Virginia acqui- 
esced in the national theory and became in 
honor estopped to deny it thereafter. 

The correct method of formulating a satis- 
factory theory of the genesis of our Constitu- 
tion will not permit a reliance upon contempo- 
raneous declarations on either side of the 
disputed question. The results accomplished 
in fact must be allowed their proper weight, 
and often these will outweigh contemporary 
theories. So it is true that the lapse of years, 
furnishing a historical perspective, should en- 
able " men a century thereafter " to better 
understand the constitutional process and its 
results. Professor Tucker demurs to this 
method of determining whether the Federal 
Constitution was an inter-State compactor an 
authoritative law. But he has employed the 
same process, with signal success, in his dis- 
cussion of abstract Sovereignty and the abstract 
Body-politic. On these subjects he reasons 
a priori, and in disregard of contemporary 
theory. The Bodies-politic he discovers in the 
original thirteen States took form at the in-

stance of men, many of whom firmly believed 
in the Social-Compact theory of government, 
and helped to embody that theory in laws and 
constitutions and judicial decisions. And here 
comes Professor Tucker, " a century there- 
after," and says of it : " This theory is fiction, 
and as an hypothesis is unsound, and must lead 
to error " (p. 3). So he employs more modern 
canons of study, and tests the processes of the 
formation of governments, in part by principles 
now considered as established, and in part by 
the results attained. A like independence of 
original investigation, employing the same a 
priori processes of reasoning, leads us to reject 
on similar grounds the inter-state-compact the- 
ory of the Constitution, and to attribute its 
creation to the People of the United States as 
a Body-politic. 

Outside of the controversial portions of his 
treatise, in respect to which he seems to hold 
a brief, Professor Tucker's commentaries on 
the Constitution are judicious and well-consid- 
ered. He seems to favor, with Chief Justice 
Marshall, and as lawyers usually do, a fair and 
reasonable construction of that great instru- 
ment, rather than either extreme of a strict 
construction which would fetter its necessary 
operations, or a broad and latitudinarian con- 
struction which would render its limitations 
meaningless. J AMES OgCAR p IERCE . 



BRITAIN AND THE BOERS.* 

Those fond of historical parallels can trace 
an interesting one in the conduct of the United 
States toward Spain in April, 1898, and the 
conduct of Great Britain toward the Transvaal 
Republic in September, 1899. As America 
was then, so is England now, busy calling the 
world's attention to the enormities of the gov- 
ernment she intends to overwhelm, to the 
wrongs she and her subjects suffer by reason 
of her opponent's misdoings, to the gain to 
civilization involved in her success, and to the 
divine mission of the Anglo-Saxon race, all 
as justification for an appeal to arms. That 
the world remains unconvinced of the good 
intentions of the aggressor in both cases, is 
certain. 

The Boer, too, like the Spaniard aforetime,

is making disregarded protestations, vainly 
peeking to turn the sympathy of some friend in 
Europe to real intervention, offering conces- 
sions which lead only to an increase of demands, 
urging an arbitration which is treated with 
contemptuous silence, and, finally, arming for 
a hopeless conflict a conflict in which over- 
throw is certain, spoliation assured, and a final 
insult added to injury in the statement that it 
is all for the sake of " Humanity " a word 
which the United States has already placed 
on that bad eminence to which Mme. Roland 
raised " Liberty." 

The analogy will go further : Dr. Jameson 
was a filibuster, if ever there was one in Africa ; 
Majuba Hill, like the destruction of the 
"Maine," gives the British government the 
lever of revenge which serves so well in prying 
up the sympathy of the populace with aggres- 
sion ; Gladstone's high-minded regard for 
treaty obligations, like Cleveland's, becomes 
the subject of popular abuse ; there are stones 
for those who counsel moderation, loud cheers 
for those who wish to fight, multitudinous dem- 
onstrations, turgid and self-righteous leaders, 
inflammatory news columns, and, at the end, 
deaths from bullets, deaths from disease, all the 
wholesale shedding of man's blood and woman's 
tears we call war ; and then the home-coming 
of successful officers to such glory as might 
have befallen Goliath had he slain the child 
David. So accurately is history repeating 
itself, that it is small wonder to find the war 
organs in America justifying Salisbury and 
Chamberlain, or else roaring as gently as once 
roared Snug the Joiner. Most of all is it en- 
couraging to the Anglo-Saxon alliance to find 
as the English found a year ago that our 
cousins across the sea are not a bit better than 
ourselves. 

All those arguments which led us to justify 
the statement of Wendell Phillips, that a Yan- 
kee's idea of hell is a place where he has to 
mind his own business, are set forth in detail, as 
if in proof of our kinship, in the work on South 
Africa by the Rev. Mr. Knox Little, written 
in the good British fashion after a brief sojourn 
in South Africa. Mrs. Olive Schreiner, in her 
statement of the question, makes a woman's 
appeal to sentiment, and directs her appeal to 
England sober, just as the American constitu- 
tionalist is appealing to America before she 
drank the toxic draught of imperialism ; though 
neither can be said to present arguments that 
avail much when blood is in the eye and re- 
venge in the heart. It is perhaps too much

[Oct. 1, 



to ask that Mrs. Schreiuer should prove the 
aggrieved party in the right. Rather does it 
rest with the Rev. Mr. Knox Little to convince 
us that the aggressor is unselfish, the more so 
that he holds a brief for his nation. 

The Rev. Mr. Knox Little's " Sketches and 
Studies" show us a writer with the candor of 
a churchman and the special pleading of a 
conservative politician. His admissions of 
England's series of prodigious misgovernments 
in South Africa are followed by professions of 
her eminent fitness to rule. His estimate of 
Mr. Rhodes as an administrator based ap- 
parently upon no fact more remote than his 
enjoyment of that worthy's profuse hospitality 
is the complement of his statement that 
Gladstone was President Krueger's dupe. 
The Boer, he tells us through his book, is un- 
cleanly in his person, unkind to the negro, 
indisposed to labor, unwilling to pay taxes, 
averse to learning English, impatient of mi- 
nute control, calvinistic in religion, prone to 
set faith before works, a driver of hard bar- 
gains, cunning in negotiation, and a number 
of other things which Mr. Knox Little is not, 
all of them perhaps not desirable, but hardly 
affording a valid reason for depriving him of 
his hardly won liberties. Some of the author's 
statements deserve quotation : 

" Krueger is not, perhaps, a statesman in the ordi- 
nary sense of the word, much less a very great man in 
any sense ; but he is a representative Boer in the sense 
that he thoroughly understands the people over whom 
he now rules. The Transvaal Boer, speaking broadly, 
is extremely ignorant, extremely prejudiced, profoundly 
fanatical, hates government cordially, and consequently 
[.i'c] dislikes the law-abiding Englishman. The love 
of money, the love of being ' a law unto himself,' scorn 
of refinement or culture, are to him second nature. All 
this Mr. Krueger seems clearly to understand. He has 
himself, however, in an eminent degree, two powerful 
characteristics dogged determination and extraordi- 
nary acuteness." 

This might be taken, for all its naivete, as 
showing the Boer more British than the Briton ; 
but it is certainly a high tribute to President 
Krueger, the higher for its being so manifestly 
begrudged. Here is another argument : 

"There was a ridiculous fallacy allowed . . . and 
pleaded since to do duty for truth. That was the doc- 
trine that the Transvaal was ' the* Boer's country,' or, 
as Mr. Krueger a British subject born in the colony 
described it with astute effrontery, his 'fatherland.' 
The 'right' to a new country must rest (1) upon an 
arrangement with those previously in possession ; or 
( 'J ) on might, the might of conquest and the might to 
hold it ; and (3) joined with one another of these, the 
right of just and good administration. By (1) the 
English hold the Cape and some other possessions, by 
(2) and (3) some other territories in South Africa. 



The Boers held the Transvaal in so far as they did 
hold it by the right of < might,' by defeating some of 
its previous possessors." 

Elsewhere in the book it is set forth in 
detail that the English acquired their title to 
the Dutch in South Africa from Holland in 
the manner in which we acquired our title to 
the Filipinos from Spain by the payment, 
in their case, of 6,000,000 ; that a large 
party among the Boers made earnest protest 
against British occupation ; that the British 
entered upon a series of ill-advised and oppres- 
sive measures which fully justified the Grand 
Trek, i. e., the wholesale shaking off of the 
British yoke by an emigration into the savage 
desert and the establishment there of an inde- 
pendent government in spite of almost over- 
whelming difficulties. It is certain also that 
Holland stole the land from Portugal, which 
had stolen it from the Negro ; and that no title 
can justify conquest. It will be noted that a 
parity of reasoning would send British armies 
into Turkey, into China, into South America, 
Hayti and Central America, into France to 
regulate the Dreyfus case, and so on, to absur- 
dity ; while any nation would be justified in 
seizing Ireland, since the British could not 
then urge " (2)," certainly could not plead a 
better title than " (1)," and would hardly ven- 
ture to put forth " (3) " in any event. Noth- 
ing can* be more convincing of the lack of 
good faith of the British than this sort of 
argument. 

For the rest, it may be said that statements 
of maladministration and corruption brought 
by Mr. Knox Little against the Transvaal gov- 
ernment and the individuals composing it, 
however often repeated, must fail with his fail- 
ure to recite details or any proofs whatever, 
since his handling of the book as a whole shows 
that he is sparing nothing to bring them into 
contempt. Let his attitude in this respect be 
contrasted with that of Mrs. Schreiner. He 
says: 

' It may be hoped that the nation whose proudest 
characteristic has hitherto been its love for liberty may 
yet recover its self-respect by withstanding injustice 
and wrongdoing with manly energy. Nothing can be 
really done to bring peace and prosperity to South 
Africa until Great Britain wakens to her duties and 
wipes out that corrupt Oligarchy, and transforms it into 
a real and free Republic or, still better, into a self- 
governing colony. Where there is freedom, there there 
will be a chance of fair dealing between man and 
man." 

Mrs. Schreiner says : 

" We look further yet with confidence, from the indi- 
vidual to the great heart of England, the people. The

great fierce freedom-loving heart of England is not dead 
yet. Under a thin veneer of gold we still hear it beat. 
Behind the shrivelled and puny English H} de who cries 
only gold,' rises the great English Jekyll who cries 
louder yet ' Justice and Honor.' We appeal to him; 
history shall not repeat itself. Nearer home, we turn 
to one whom all South Africans are proud of, and 
we would say to Paul Krueger, Great old man, first 
but not last of South Africa's great line of rulers, 
you have shown us you could fight for freedom; show 
us you can win peace. On the foot of that great 
statue which in the future the men and women of 
South Africa will raise to you let this stand written: 
"This man loved freedom, and fought for it; but his 
heart was large ; he could forget injuries and deal 
generously." ' 

It may be said, in conclusion, that stock- 
jobbing interests have from the beginning 
been the controlling cause in the dispute be- 
tween Chamberlain and Krueger. The five- 
year-residence franchise which Englishmen 
notoriously decline in the United States, they 
seek in Africa, for no better reason, as Mr. 
Knox Little admits, than that mining interests 
are taxed more heavily by the Boers than they 
would be with the admission of the Uitlanders 
to citizenship. But he does not say that the 
cause which operates against the acceptance of 
the franchise in the American Republic the 
forswearing of allegiance to the Queen is 
not an element in the British contention with 
the Transvaal. The Boers, unless some one 
intervenes, are on the horns of a dilemma : If 
they grant their franchise to Englishmen who 
hold allegiance to the mother-country, that 
heritage of freedom they carved out of arid 
sands and savage hearts ceases to be theirs ; if 
they fail in this, still is that freedom sacrificed 
to advancing British bayonets. 

WALLACE RICE. 



M. A. DsWoLFE HOWE has edited a series of short 
essays, under the general title of the " Beacon Biog- 
raphies " (Small, Maynard & Co.). The aim of the 
series is to bring within a short compass an account of 
the lives of prominent Americans. Thus far the fol- 
lowing volumes have appeared: "Daniel Webster," by 
Mr. Norman Hapgood; " Phillipps Brooks," by the ed- 
itor; "Robert E. Lee," by Professor W. P. Trent; 
"David Farragut," by James Barnes; "J. R. Lowell," 
by Professor E. E. Hale, Jr. These little books are 
uniformly well done, and in the cases of Brooks and 
Lowell are exceptionally well done. In one or two 
instances the general unity of impression is lost by an 
attempt at giving too many details, but each volume is 
very readable, and as a whole the series will prove val- 
uable to the reader, even if at times the author seems 
to adopt the point of view of the apologist rather than 
that of the biographer. This is perhaps most evident 
in the volume upon Lee, and least so in that upon 
Webster. 



RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY.* 



There is no decline from the earlier volumes of 
verse by Mr. F. B. Money-Coutts in " The Alham- 
bra, and Other Poems," just now published. The 
anthor is one to reckon with, for he has technical 
mastery and his own distinctive form of utterance. 
There is poetical satisfaction to be got from every 
page of these firmly-knit and harmonious measures. 
Since it is sometimes well for a nation to see itself 
as it is viewed by others, we select for our illus- 
tration the fine sonnet on President Cleveland's 
Venezuelan message. 

"Yes I it was well, and passing well, that we 
To do their pleasure for so small a thing, 
Refused to set wild war upon the wing, 
Or to defile that unensangnined sea, 
That flows between our Countries of the Free, 
With freight of fratricide ! We let them ring 
Alarum; kept us crimeless, and shall bring 
White record to the days that are to be I 

"The time will come when they will look with shame 
On that time-serving message of their Chief ; 

His use ignoble of their noble name 
For paltry purpose, must be charged with grief 
For the harvest of their Age, when every sheaf 

Is garnered of their folly and their fame." 

There are equally vigorous lines dedicated to the 
rejection of the Arbitration Treaty by our Senate, 
and to our declaration of war against Spain. It is 
a friend, not a foe, who says these things, which 
should make them the more bitter.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge, inscribing to his 
father a copy of verses, observes : 

" Mine ia a pale and imitative age. 

No purple rube for me 
Thy name, and this poor Terse my heritage. 
Which here I dedicate to thee." 

The modesty of the confession is becoming, for there 
is nothing in this Mr. Coleridge's volume of " Poems" 
to suggest the royal lineage of the writer. Pious 
musings in reasonably smooth rhythm, and faint 
echoes from the song of departed masters, are all 
that is vouchsafed us. 

" Art i hou not wounded ? wilt not stay ? 

Let u-i lie down and die. 
The fight ; 8 over for to-day. 

Why toil in vain, friend, why? 
We (.hull not win to-day, nor yet to-night; 

Shall never win, bat we can always fight !" 

This composite of the thought of Miss Rossetti, 
dough, and Mr. Swinburne, is a characteristic ex- 
ample of our author's work. 

Mr. W. E. Brocklebank is a poet of gloom and 
melancholy. He looks at life only to behold the 
shadow of death cast upon it, and his lightest mus- 
ings have a funereal tinge. Even love dawns upon 
the trusting soul but to its undoing, as we learn from 
" The Difference." 

" Were you the moon and I the sea, 

Then love were well ; your kiss wonld fall 
In night's sweet silent hours on me 
And my heart's tides obey your call. 

" Were yon the player, I the lute, 

Then love were well ; yonr hand wonld wake 
The chords that all the world leave mute. 
Ah, sweet music we should make ! 

" Were you the sea and I the stream. 

Then love were well ; to your deep breast 
My whole tired life would come and dream. 
Made one with you in utter rest. 

" But yon are woman, I am man. 

And therefore love is not all well ; 
"I'M like all love since Life began 
Heaven's bark upon the sea of hell." 

These numbers are at least melodious, and melody 
is an almost unfailing attribute of Mr. Brock le- 
bank's verse. He almost makes sorrow seem beau- 
tiful, and the peace of death a boon to be desired. 
And in such a poem as the dramatic fragment, 
" Bellerophon in Argos,'' his blank verse attains a 
dignity of diction that is well-nigh Swinburnian in 
its movement. 

The Shadows, and Other Poems," of Mr. E. 
Samuels are but five in number, and make up one 
of the thinnest of volumes. They reflect the moods 
of a man who has imagined happiness but never 
realized it, and the cast of deep melancholy is over 
them all. Such lines as these give a truthful ex- 
pression of the chastened pathos of renunciation : 

" What is this little parting of our lives 
But the short passing of a winter day ? 
And we should only mar the perfect bliss 
Of coming summer time, if memory 
With aught might charge us we could wish undone. 
Yet is my life not wholly void of thee : 
Across the bleakness of this winter day 



At even steals the sweetness of a dream, 
And there I see thy face and hear thy voice. 
And roam together with tlu-c, until in mtul, 
Throughout the fair Elysian fields of uleep, 
Not knowing that but here, our waiting past, 
We all in all for evermore are one." 

" The Silence of Love," by Mr. Edmond Holmes, 
is a charmingly printed volume of fifty sonnets in 
the Shakespearian form. Their feeling is that of 
the man who conceives of love as too beautiful a 
thing to be realized, as better to dream about than 
to enjoy in full fruition. It is the feeling, in .-hurt, 
that Dr. Ibsen has expressed so forcibly in " Love's 
Comedy." One of the sonnets may be quoted: 

"Sometimes in dreams I clasp thy breast to mine. 
And kiss thy lips and with thy tresses play, 
And through the floodgates of some outward sign 
Pour all the passion of my heart away. 
Sometimes in dreams I tell my secret so ; 
Then wake to find that it is still untold. 
That still the surging, storm-fed waters flow. 
By Pate's relentless ramparts still controlled. 
Oh, better thus, better that passion's force. 
Which love's impatient raptures had set free. 
Pent in the prison of its channelled course, 
Should give the river strength to reach the sea. 
Better, for passion's sake, that passion's dream 
Should fade forgotten with the morn's first gleam." 

This is the note of the entire sonnet series, and we 
must confess that it grows a little monotonous. 
Mr. Holmes is master of a simple and even diction 
which is distinctly poetical at all times, yet which 
never exceeds the bounds of the conventional sort 
of expression that lies within the reach of almost 
any cultivated mind. 

The " Poems " of Miss Eva Gore- Booth are 
mostly brief pieces, inclining to be epigrammatic, 
although now and then striking a sustained note of 
high seriounness. The writer scores rather neatly 
off "A Critic" in the following lines: 

" His was the voice 

That when the morning stars together sang 
In their first rapture of awakened life 
And Qod's own angels held their breath for joy. 
Whilst heaven, by that new harmony entranced, 
Was wrapped in awful silence broke the charm. 
Serenely speaking in cold accents thus 
' I know not, yet methinka 'twas Jupiter 
Went out of tune and spoilt the whole effect.' " 

The Celtic glamour is about the verse of Mrs. Cle- 
ment Shorter, although it does not have the effect 
of blurring the outlines of her thought as completely 
as with many other writers of the cult to which she 
belongs. Here is a pretty tribute to Ireland : 
" Here he loosed from his hand 

A brown tumult of wings, 
Till the wind on the sea 
Bore the strange melody 
Of an island that sings." 

And here is a charming lyric : 

" Little white rose that I loved, I loved, 

Roigin ban, Roitin ban / 
Fair my bud as the morning's dawn. 
1 kissed ray beautiful flower to bloom, 
My heart grew glad for its rich perfume 
Little white rose that I loved. 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



241 



" Little white rose that I loved grew red, 

Roisin ruad, Roisin ruad ! 
Passionate tears I wept for you. 
Love is more sweet than the world's fame, 
I dream you back in ray heart the same, 
Little white rose that I loved ! 

41 Little white rose that I loved grew black, 

Roisin dub, Roisin dub ! 
So I knew not the heart of you. 
Lost in the world's alluring fire, 
I cry in the night for my heart's desire, 

Little white rose that I loved !" 

Mrs. Shorter has the instinct of balladry, and her 
most important pieces are cast in the narrative form. 
But these we must be content only to mention. 

The " Fugitives " of Miss Winifred Lucas are 
the merest bits of verse, hardly any of them exceed- 
ing the compass of ten or twelve short lines. " The 
Dream " is here reproduced. 

" Am I so bankrupt of delight 

I turn upon the stars for pain ? 
The happy stars that dream all night 
The dream I must not dream again ! 

" Oh not until the stars to use 

The glory of my dream forbear, 
Its robe of light need I refuse 
As earthly, for myself to wear." 

The subtlety of suggestion here illustrated is char- 
acteristic of most of these fugitive expressions of 
single thoughts, and makes the pages of the slender 
book fit to be pondered over. 

Pictures of travel, from Rome to California, 
and impressions from those wider than terrestrial 
reaches that the soul knows in its trackless sojourns, 
are what we find in the " Sea Drift " of Miss Grace 
Ellery Channing. The author would not be true to 
the name that she bears were her song not informed 
with the high ideals of thought and feeling for which 
New England has ever stood amid the breaking 
waves of a composite European influx, and she 
would be false to the best traditions of our race 
were she not to cherish the history of the island 
home whence our ancestors came. She sings : 

" Who comes to England not to learn 
The love for her his fathers bore, 

Breathing her air can still return 
No kindlier than he was before ? 
In vain, for him, from shore to shore 

Those fathers strewed an alien strand 
With the loved names that evermore 

Are native to our ear and land. 

" Who sees the English elm trees fling 

Long shadows where his footsteps pass, 
Or marks the crocuses that Spring 

Sets starlike in the English grass, 

And sees not, as within a glass, 
New England's loved reflection rise, 

Mists darker and more dense, alas ! 
Than England's fogs are in his eyes ? " 

The more abstract and spiritual mood of Miss 
Channing's verse may be illustrated by this extract 
from the beautiful poem, " Pity, God." 

41 Pity thy dumb ones, God ! thy speechless ones, 
Only whose tongues free aud unfettered are ; 
Whose lips the secret of the morning star 



Hath ne'er unlocked ; no winged word of fire, 

No fancy and no freedom, no desire 

Thrilled from the throat in song, stolen from the fingers 

In subtler speech which burns and glows and lingers. 

Through thousand forms wherein divinely wrought 

Into divinest life divinest thought 

Stands fashioned ; whom the Pentecostal flame 

Hath never touched ; in whom nor joy nor shame 

Nor liberty, nor truth's self clearest shown 

Hath utterance stirred ; 
Nor the Beloved's heart upon their own 

Wooed forth one whispered word ; 

Speechless, whose tongues speak only, make them whole, 
O God, unseal the dumb lips of their soul ! " 

This satisfying and exquisite volume of verse tempts 
us to endless quotation, but the examples given above 
must suffice. The note is always a pure one, and 
not infrequently is enforced by harmonies of the 
rarer kind. The dominant spirituality of Miss 
Channing's song has just enough of sensuousness to 
keep it in touch with life, but not enough to dim the 
fine ether which is its natural element. 

Mrs. SewalFs " Ode to Girlhood " is a somewhat 
stiff and labored poem, in which imaginative flashes 
and prosaic details are quite curiously blent. Here 
is one section of the composition: 

44 Wherefore so much beyond all need so fair ? 
Ye very tender are, 

And keep small animals to watch and feed, 
And would not jilt a beetle from his weed, 
And step around a resting butterfly 
With careful courtesy ; 
And from your passion-potent finger-tips, 
And long- prepared comfort of your lips, 
And shoulders hollowed for the weary man 
Since earth began, 

Ye nurse and heal whatever things ye meet, 
Then who can say ye need not be so sweet ? " 

The infelicities of word and phrase are many in the 
poem from which this is taken, yet they are in part 
redeemed by touches of originality and a quite un- 
conventional treatment of the whole theme. An 
even more striking piece is called "Youth," and 
thus begins : 

" I am the spirit that denies. 
Yes, and with full-regarding eyes 

Comprehending the facts of earth's sorrow and shame, 
And denying the truth of it just the same ; 
That takes man's face in two palms soft, 
And looks deep into its brow and oft, 
Aud finds the good it has longed to find, 
And denies there is anything hidden behind." 

In some of Mrs. Sewall's briefer lyrics there are 
suggestions, now of the quaintness of Emily Dickin- 
son, now of the intimate religious feeling of Christina 
Rossetti. Such a poem as " How Love Came " 
illustrates both of these features at once. 

The poems of Miss Martha Gilbert Dickinson are 
of very uneven quality, at one time giving unexcep- 
tional embodiment of some happy conception, at 
another repelling by their confusion of imagery and 
forcing of the note. " Benedicite," for example, 
would be a true poem were it not for the occasional 
jar of these intrusive elements.

" Tht waves in prostrate worship lie, and cease 
To count the pebble* on their rosary ;

We note particularly in this example, first, the fine 
figure, " Day drops her anchor off the world," and 
the immediate appearance of the incongruous no- 
tion of " shriving." The suggestion of the kneeling 
hills is forced, and the word " crowds " is infelici- 
tous. Why not say, instead, 

"Then the real Presence thrills all Nature's heart? " 
The most completely satisfactory of Miss Dickin- 
son's poems is the one called " Summer's Will." 
Here there is no confusion, and no straining for 
effect, but instead a single figure delicately and con- 
sistently worked out. 

"These are the clauses of Summer's will 
To Autumn, a languorous haze to fill 
Valley and mountain with vague regret 
For her whose beauty they cannot forget. 
To Mortals, maples whose colors dare 
Till scarlet Flamingoes seem nesting there ; 
Also a river woven in gold. 
Where willows murmur their stories old ; 
Treasures of golden rod, troops of corn. 
And sumach torches out-heralding dawn. 
To Heaven, lest day despair too soon. 
The silvery horn of her harvest moon. 
To Wondering Cattle, pastures green 
Rivalling May in their transient sheen ; 
All her black crows to the lonely Pines. 
To Straggling Fences, her madcap vines ; 
But to the Ocean only her tears, 
Tempests of parting and desolate fears. 
Sealed in witch hazel, filled in frost. 
To the witnessing winds ' t was all but tossed 
When she smiled a gentian codicil 
' My love to the roadside under the hill ! ' " 

Aside from its capricious capitalization, there seems 
no reasonable fault to be found with this charming 
poem. 

It is not our intention to make any contribution 
of our own to the discussion of that over-discussed 
poem, " The Man with the Hoe." We have known 
Mr. Markham as a poet for many years, and have 
held the sturdy vigor of his verse in high esteem. It 
is merely an inexplicable caprice of the public that 
has singled out this particular poem for extravagant 
laudation or censure, as the case may be, and has 
achieved for its writer a reputation that his previous 
years of work had not won for him. We wish only 
to say that in his assumption that society has made 
" the man with the hoe " what he is, there is a beg- 
ging of the whole question. We are rather inclined 
to think that men make themselves instead of being 
moulded by pressure from without, and that men 
with hoes and other useful implements play a proper 
part in the social economy. And we are also minded 
to quote a few apposite sentences from one of 



Stevenson's essays. " When our little poets have 
to be sent to the ploughman to learn wisdom, we 
must be careful how we tamper with our ploughman. 
When a man in not the beat of circumstances pre- 
serves composure of mind, and relishes ale and 
tobacco, and his wife and children, in the intervals 
of dull and unremunerative labor, when a man in 
this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to 
what are called his intellectual superiors, there is 
plainly something to be lost, as well as something 
to be gained, by teaching him to think differently. 
It is better to leave him as he is than to teach him 
whining." The popular success of Mr. Markham's 
single poem has, however, had the excellent effect of 
bringing out a volume of verse which might other- 
wise never have seen the light, and which was cer- 
tainly worth printing. It is not alone in the titular 
poem that the author has elected to wear the 
prophet's mantle, for the same plea for the oppressed 
and the same vision of a coming human brotherhood 
is the strain of most of his songs. The ideal is of 
the noblest, if here somewhat vaguely conceived, 
and we cannot have too many poets for whom the 
message comes in such words as these : 

'' Go, be a dauntless voice, a bugle-cry 
In darkening battle when the winds are high 
A clear sane cry wherein the Qod is heard 
To speak to men the one redeeming word." 

In his " Song to the Divine Mother," which is per- 
haps the finest of his poems, the passionate social- 
ism of the author achieves an expression that would 
not have been unworthy of Morris. But for all the 
deep human feeling with which these songs of the 
" Fraternal State " are charged, we are bound to 
say that Mr. Markham appeals to us more strongly 
when he forgets man and turns to the consolations 
of nature, or when, giving free rein to the imagina- 
tion, he has such a vision as this of " The Wharf of 
Dreams." 

"Strange wares are handled on the wharves of sleep : 

Shadows of shadows pass, and many a light 

Flashes a signal fire across the night ; 
Barges depart whose voiceless steersmen keep 
Their way without a star upon the deep ; 

And from lost ships, homing with ghostly crews. 

Come cries of incommunicable news, 
While cargoes pile the piers, a moon-white heap 

" Budgets of dream-dust, merchandise of song, 
Wreckage of hope and packs of ancient wrong, 

Nepenthes gathered from a secret strand, 
Fardels of heartache, burdens of old sins, 
Luggage sent down from dim ancestral inns, 
And bales of fantasy from No- Man's Land." 

a For the King," by Mr. Robert Cameron Rogers, 
is a spirited irregular version of the story of the 
three mighty men of war who brought some water 
from the well of Bethlehem to King David. Spirit, 
rather than finish, is the characteristic of most of 
the poems contained in this volume, as may be illus- 
trated by a stanza from the so-called lyric ode " To 
Spain," a piece having for its ultimate object it 
might have had a worthier one the justification 
of our recent war. 



1899.]

" We are not a warlike nation, 

Fashioned rather for keen trading. 
Some will say the style is English, 

That from them we get the cut 
East and West our ships went speeding, 

Decks awash from heavy lading, 
Bowsprits poked in every harbor, 
Never seeking quarrels, 

But 
When our rich Levant trade came and Tripoli claimed tribute 

from it, 

Tribute paid by other navies trading down the midland sea, 
We, the least and last of nations, blew her gunboats to 

Mahomet, 
Blew the faithful to their houris, made the Straits forever 

free." 

The conclusion of the argument thus pursued is that 
when we could no longer stand the conduct of our 
Spanish neighbor we proceeded to clean her out. 
Discrete silence is maintained concerning our sub- 
sequent adoption of Spanish methods as an outcome 
of this spasm of virtue. When he does not attempt 
to be stirring, Mr. Rogers appears as a pretty ver- 
sifier upon the familiar themes of the minor poet. 
Bat he has done better work than is to be found in 
the present volume. 

" An Epic of the Soul " is an anonymous cycle 
of eighty short poems, all cast in a form which illus- 
trates a distinct novelty in versification. They de- 
pict the struggle for faith in the mind of the 
doubter, to which the spirit of mysticism comes at 
last to reconcile the conflicting currents of thought. 
We select the following two consecutive numbers, 
because they are fairly typical of the whole, and 
also because they show how easy is the descent from 
the plane of poetry to that of prose. 

" Does God look down upon us from a star 
Careless of love or hate, of good or ill ? 
And will He send no shining avatar 
While man's great spirit beats its prison-bar 
Longing to worship, and to know His will ? 

" If He be but a great, impartial eye 

Expressionless, then let us creep and die, 
For we ourselves are more humane by far. 

" Yet how can we submit to those inflictions 

At which the powers of reason grow satirical, 
Or pin our faith to any pleasing fictions, 
Though honest seeming, full of contradictions, 
Supported by the jugglery of miracle ? 

" The story seems a beautiful invention 

The birth, the resurrection, the ascension 
And can it move the mind with deep convictions? " 

The author of these reflections is said to be "known 
in more than one department of literature." We 
must say that it would be a slender reputation that 
could be enhanced by confessing the authorship of 
the present work. 

If Mr. Madison Cawein would refrain from writing 
so much, or from printing so much of what he writes, 
his niche in the temple of our contemporaneous 
poetry would be more securely occupied. In such a 
case, he would suppress such hopeless verse as this : 
" For, all around me, upon field and hill, 

Enchantment lies as of mysterious flutes ; 
As if the music of a god's good- will 
Had taken on material attributes 
In blooms, like chords," 



Or as this : 

" For he, of all the country-side confessed, 
The most religious was and happiest ; 
A Methodist, and one whom faith still led, 
No books except the Bible had he read." 

Is the author of these lines, sated with the inspira- 
tion of Keats, now groping after the inspiration of 
Wordsworth ? We trust not, for the change would 
not be for the better. The strength of Mr. Cawein 
lies in his sensuous interpretations of nature, in the 
attitude of passionate communicant rather than of 
high priest. We need not reiterate our often- 
expressed satisfaction with the best of his verse. 
The new volume, " Myth and Romance," while in- 
cluding such passages as have been quoted, includes 
also many exquisite lyrics, none of them, perhaps, 
exceeding in beauty these stanzas inscribed to 
"Youth." 

" Morn's mystic rose is reddening on the hills, 
Dawn's irised nautilus makes glad the sea ; 
There is a lyre of flame that throbs and fills 
Far heaven and earth, with hope's wild ecstasy, 
With lilied field and grove, 
Haunts of the turtle-dove, 
Here is the land of Love. 

"The chariot of the noon makes blind the blue 
As towards the goal his burning axle glares ; 
There is a fiery trumpet thrilling through 
Wide heaven and earth with deeds of one who dares, 
With peaks of splendid name, 
Wrapped round with astral flame. 
Here is the land of Fame. 

" The purple priesthood of the evening waits 
With golden pomp within the templed skies ; 
There is a harp of worship at the gates 
Of heaven and earth that bids the soul arise, 
With columned cliffs and long 
Vales, music breathes among, 
Here is the land of Song. 

" Moon-crowned, the epic of the night unrolls 
Its starry utterance o'er height and deep ; 
There is a voice of beauty at the souls 
Of heaven and earth that lulls the heart asleep, 
With storied woods and streams, 
Where marble glows and gleams, 
Here is the land of Dreams." 

A poet of far wider renown than any Mr. Cawein 
has yet achieved would not need to feel ashamed 
of these well-nigh faultless verses. 

Mr. William Griffith is a bold man to venture 
upon " A Litany of Nations," remembering what 
Mr. Swinburne has done with that theme. Here 
is one of the twelve quatrains, with the common 
refrain : 

" SWITZERLAND. 

" From mountains crowned with freedom, I repeat 
The skies' great secret, Time's eternal quest 
Above the nations thundering at my feet 
And overlook the West. 

"Mother of Nations, as of yore 
Remember us and, near us 
Beseeching Thfe forevermore, 
Hear, O hear us !" , 

We like Mr. Griffith better when the lofty mood is 
not upon him, and when he sings of the joys of 
vagabondage and the life of the open air.

[Oct. 1, 



"So, while the momenta slip and slide 

Prom Winter nnto Spring, 
With hedges flushing either side 

The country lanes, I bring 
AeroM the mart a foolish heart 

To hear the finches sing." 

In this poem, and many other* of like strain, the 
writer has caught the wilding note of such singers 
as Mr. Bliss Carman and Professor Roberts. 

To the two small volumes, dated 1887 and 1889, 
of verse by the late Edward Rowland Sill, the pub- 
lishers have now added " a third and final volume," 
entitled " Hermione, and Other Poems." We have 
been in the habit of regarding Sill's talent as a 
slender one, but in view of these three collections 
taken together, and the fact that even now much of 
his work remains uncollected, the opinion needs re- 
vision, for we are already in possession of some 
three hundred printed pages, and many a shining 
reputation has no more than that to its credit. We 
doubt if Sill will ever have a shining reputation, 
for the rare purity of his note was such as to fall 
upon few ears fit to hear it, but we have no doubt 
that his work will be held as a precious permanent 
possession by an audience of whom any poet might 
be proud. Even our expectation that the present 
selection, coming after the two others, would prove 
inferior in quality, offering only the lees of his 
song, is not fulfilled, for we should hesitate to affirm 
that it was any less worthy of publication than 
either of its predecessors. The work that gives us 
such haunting phrases as "yon dim ghost that 
last night was the moon," and that brings to rightly- 
attuned ears the message of 

" All the holy hills and sacred waters ; 
When the sea-wind swings its evening censer, 
Till the misty incense hides the altar 
And the long-robed shadows, lowly kneeling," 

is work to be cherished in affectionate remembrance. 
And how ethically fine is the mood that speaks to 
us from the depths of spiritual experience in such 
verses as " Tempted." 

" Yes, I know what yon say : 

Since it cannot be soul to soul, 
Be it flesh to flesh, as it may ; 
But is Earth the whole ? 

"Shall a man betray the Past 

For all Earth (fives? 
' But the Past i dead ? ' At last, 

It is all that live*. 

" Which were the nobler goal 

To snatch at the moment's bliss, 
Or to swear I will keep my soul 
Clean for her kisa?" 

Here is an antidote indeed for the sensual cater- 
waulings of a host of bardlings who exalt the pas- 
sion of a moment to the rank of a Lord of Life. 
Although his biography is silent upon this subject, 
we know well from S ll's verse that he felt the im- 
perious appeal of love, and suffered as such sensi- 
tive souls munt suffer when their ardors are spent 
in vain. The inner meaning is as clear in his love- 
lyrics as in those of the Swiss cycle in Matthew 



Arnold's volume. But the most typical expression 
of Sill's outlook upon life, with all its dominant 
spirituality, is found in such a poem as that called 
" Fertility." 

" Clear water on smooth rock 
Could give no foot-hold for a single flower, 
Or slenderest shaft of grain : 
The stone must crumble under storm and rain 
The forests crash beneath the whirlwind's power 
And broken boughs from many a tempest shock, 
And fallen leaves of many a wintry hour, 
Must mingle in the mould, 
Before the harvest whitens on the plain. 
Bearing an hundred-fold. 
Patience, O weary heart t 
Let all thy sparkling hours depart. 
And all thy hopes be withered with the frost, 
And every effort tempettt-tost 
So, when all life's green leave* 
Are fallen, and mouldered underneath the sod, 
Thou shall go not too lightly to thy God, 
But heavy with full sheaves." 

Fated, like Poe and Lanier, to pass into an inher- 
itance of unfulfilled renown at an early age, Henry 
Timrod has been less fortunate than his compeers 
in posthumous favor. This is due, in part, to the 
fact that the 1873 collected edition of his complete 
poems became tied up through the bankruptcy of 
the publishers, and practically unobtainable. To 
present these poems once more to the public, and 
at the same time to establish a suitable memorial 
of the poet, a chartered association has been formed 
in South Carolina, and the first-fruits of its activity 
takes the form of a " Memorial Edition," provided 
with memoir and portrait, and including a few 
pieces not heretofore collected. We are glad to have 
this volume, for Timrod has been little more than a 
name to the reading public at large, and his poems 
deserve the place in every cultivated home in the 
United States," prophesied for them by Longfellow 
a score of years ago.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The huge and exhaustive work by 

I- S - Bloch 8aid to have g' ven th 
Czar his notion of calling the Peace 
Conference which met recently at The Hague, has 
now been translated in part by Mr. R. C. Long, and 
appears before the American public with a long and 
valuable " prefatory conversation " with the author, 
reported by Mr. W. T. Stead. The title though 
the present woik contains but one of the books, the 
sixth, of the original is long and cumbersome, 
but sufficiently apt : "The Future of War in Its 
Technical, Economic, and Political Relations Is 
War Now Impossible ?" ( Doubleday & MrClure 
Co). M. Bloch concludes that it is impossible ; and 
the reader will agree with him in part and only 
in part, because, as he observes in relation to other 
things, he is advancing a theory, and war, unfortu- 
nately, is practice. He speaks, for example, of the

absolute impossibility, under certain conditions, of 
taking intreuchments ; yet the dismounted cavalry 
at Santiago did exactly what he sets forth as im- 
possible. The combination of a dynamite gun with 
a gatling battery one to unearth the foe, the 
other to slay him as he flees was unheard of and 
unthought of before the Americans used them, and 
overthrows some of the author's best reasoned con- 
clusions. This being true, it is likely that future 
wars will be filled with similar surprises, only on a 
greater scale if Europe be the scene. But most of 
the conclusions at which M. Bloch arrives outside 
of the actualities of battle, the effect of war upon 
the economic and political side of national life, have 
in them little of uncertainty and abundantly dem- 
onstrate the appeal to savagery to be not merely 
murderous but self-murderous to all who undertake 
it. How insane a thing a war is, and how its hor- 
rors react upon those who habituate themselves to 
them, is unintentionally displayed by the quotation 
given here from the lips of General Dragomiroff : 
" The manoeuvres would be infinitely more valuable 
if one cartiidge in a thousand contained a ball." 
Humanitarians have welcomed all the accumulated 
disasters which modern science makes possible, as 
tending the sooner to do away with the thought of 
an appeal to arms. Great things are argued in this 
direction from the new rifles, with their increased 
velocity and decreased missile ; but the experience 
of the Americans now waging war upon the Fili- 
pinos makes the old-fashioned Springfield with 
smokeless powder cartridges the more effective 
weapon in comparison with the Krag-Jorgensson. 
On the other hand, the large proportion of officers 
slain in recent wars has had the effect of leaving 
Germany without a war party among professional 
soldiers, since an outbreak of hostilities virtually 
signs the death-warrant of every man with shoulder 
straps. One thing the author makes quite plain 
the uselessness of a large navy unless it is to be in 
some sense or another " supreme." The ethical 
argument against war has no part in the scheme 
here, hot blood being notably hotter than cool words 
are refrigerating; yet the economic argument, that 
war in the future will become a question of starva- 
tion at home, comes to the same thing. Civilized 
society has learned individually that violence leads 
to nothing but disorder ; but the lesson is yet to be 
learned by nations. America, lately an exemplar 
for lovers of peace, has become as veritable a 
swashbuckler as the rest ; but we are not yet set in 
the broad path that goes down to death. This book 
should aid us in leaving it. 

Mr. Herbert E. Hamblen's " Yarn of 

Dubinin yarnt T> -i tr / c< *u \ 

of sailor Hje. a Bucko Mate (Scnbner) is in- 
ferior to his capital book u On Many 
Seas, " chiefly because the author has, in his pres- 
ent venture, gotten out of his true literary element. 
Mr. Hamblen's forte is the literal narration of his 
own unusually interesting and varied experiences 
as sailor and as " railroad man." But in the pres- 



ent volume he largely eschews fact and tries his 
hand at fiction. The result is distinctly disappoint- 
ing, the more so because Mr. Hamblen's former 
books were so good. The " Yarn " the strictly 
imaginative part of it at least is not much better 
than the sort of thing served up in the dime-novel, 
and a good deal of it must be pronounced coarse 
and deleterious stuff. We do not think the com- 
mon sailor is the degraded ruffian, the abject bully 
and blackguard, that the reader of Mr. Hamblen's 
extravaganza may fairly infer him to be. In fact, 
we know he is not. There is no handier, cleanlier, 
braver, kindlier, and, according to his lights, hon- 
ester man than the American sailor ; and he will 
not thank Mr. Hamblen for portraying him as phy- 
sically a hog and morally a Yahoo. Mr. Hamblen's 
opening chapters, which appear to be founded on 
fact, are not so bad ; but even here there is too 
much ruffianism, too much of the low side of mar- 
itime life and character. Even the " Bucko Mate " 
who spins the " Yarn " is a confessed brute, bully, 
and cut-throat, whose supposed redeeming trait is 
the harboring of some sloppy sentiment about 
" Rose's boy and mine." The opening chapters 
are, as we have said, fairly good, and depict life as 
it was on the scandalous old Black Ball packets 
with some degree of literal truth. After that comes 
the fiction shooting, stabbing, gambling, robbery, 
piracy, battle, murder, and sudden death. A treas- 
ure buried on a Pacific it-land furnishes the motif 
of the closing chapters. Mr. Hamblen's book will 
not lack readers ; but we trust he will return to his 
last, and give us something next time worthy of 
himself. 



A new book on 
an old worthy. 



No one can deny that Mr. Augustine 
Jones, in his " Life and Work of 
Thomas Dudley, the second Gov- 
ernor of Massachusetts " (Houghton, MifHm &Co.), 
shows careful reading of his souices, and much zeal 
and patience in selecting and bringing together 
facts relating to that worthy. Not so much can be 
said for his literary method. He has imbedded in 
the connecting tissue of his narrative a great num- 
ber of quotations, generally good quotations, some 
selected because they convey facts and some because 
they convey opinions. Many of these quotations, as 
well as other matter, are repeated, occasionally more 
than once. The total result is a book that contains 
a large amount of solid information, but in a style 
cumbrous, heavy, and not attractive. Perhaps in 
these particulars the book is in some measure a 
symbol of its hero. Mr. Jones's secondary object 
in preparing the book, unless indeed it is the primary 
one, is to clear the name of Dudley of the old charge 
of bigotry and intolerance. " We indulge the hope," 
he says, ' that the thoughtful reader will conclude 
with us that an injustice has been done to the 
memory of an excellent man, who cordially wel- 
comed truth from every source." That will depend, 
we imagine, upon the reader's point of view. The 
author has shown very conclusively that the Gov-

ernor bad a thorough understanding of the ideas 
on which the Colony of Massachusetts was founded, 
that he believed thoroughly in those ideas, that he 
committed his life and fortunes to the attempt to 
realize them, and that he wrought, suffered, and 
sacrificed in the effort to realize them. He entered 
deeply into the religious and political life of the 
colony from 1630, the time of the great emigration, 
to 1653, the time of his death, holding perhaps a 
variant view here, and urging a different practice 
there, hut on the whole in accord with the main 
stream of thought, feeling, and action. We see no 
reason to put him in a category by himself. He 
stands or falls with the Puritans of Massachusetts 
Bay. The author says Dudley " was as liberal in 
religion and politics as the public sentiment of his 
age allowed," and " was not then regarded as intol- 
erant," which is, generally speaking, true as re- 
spects his environment ; but when the author says 
nothing beyond this can be required," and that 
" the judgment of his neighbors and peers is the 
only reasonable one," he raises again the question 
of point of view. These Massachusetts Puritans, 
upon the whole, were liberal and tolerant beyond 
their time; much can be said to show that they 
permitted as much liberty of thought and action as 
was safe, considering the condition of the colony ; 
but this leaves unanswered the important and diffi- 
cult question of the relation of the idealist to so- 
ciety, or of the prophet to the practical statesman. 
We shall not enter upon a discussion of this subject, 
but merely throw out the question whether Roger 
Williams and men like him have any real mission 
in the world, and if so, what it is. It is very evi- 
dent, for one thing, that they are a different class 
of men from the Dudleys, good as the Dudleys are 
in their place. The mechanical make-up of the 
book is excellent, and the illustrations of early 
scenes in Dudley's life are admirable. 

Besides recapitulating the events 
and glancing at the protagonists of 
the remarkable political drama that 
closed with the Tenth of Thermidor, Dr. Jan Ten 
Brink's " Robespierre and the Red Terror " ( Lip- 
pincott) is an intelligent and impartial study of 
the character and motives of the arch fanatic whom 
Napoleon styled the "scapegoat of the Revolu- 
tion." Dr. Ten Brink's estimate of Robespierre 
does not differ essentially from that of Mr. John 
Morley whose masterly essay ought to be in the 
hands of every student of the period. Robespierre 
was a zealot who shed blood like water to bring 
about his Utopia. But the old notion that he shed 
blood merely for the sake of shedding it is a vulgar 
error. He sent his victims to the scaffold, as Philip 
II. sent his to the stake, with the best intentions 
in the world. The French bigot aimed to effect 
the reign of virtue, justice, and felicity on earth ; 
the Spanish bigot meant to do God service and to 
save mankind from the pit. We rightly abhor the 
errors of both ; but we are not to lose sight of the

quality of their motives, and thereby mins the 
lesson of their lives. Potential Robespierres, fanat- 
ics burning to try their nostrums on society, we 
have with us in plenty to-day; and if the French 
Revolution teaches us anything of practical value, 
it is the peril of putting these " saviors of society " 
in a position to wreak their theories on us unre- 
strained. We are glad to note that Dr. Ten Brink 
includes a chapter on Robespierre's youth and early 
manhood, a period of his life that throws much light 
on his character, and is too often unconsidered by 
his critics and delineators. History affords no more 
curious psychological study than the evolution into 
the inexorable author of the bloody Law of 22nd 
Prairail of the harmless young sentimentalist of 
Arras, who sang madrigals and sipped rose-water 
with the " Rosatis," who wept for days over the 
death of a pet pigeon, and who threw up a judicial 
post in a fit of remorse after sentencing a murderer 
to the gallows. Dr. Ten Brink's style is easy and 
discursive, and he makes no flourish of philosophi- 
cal profundity or novelty of view. The book is 
well adapted to popular reading, and contains some 
interesting portraits and reproductions of old prints. 
It should be added that the author is a professor at 
the University of Leyden, and that his translator, 
Mr. J. Hedeman, has done his work well. 



A famout 
maker of 

anthologitt. 



The brilliant circle of English liter- 
ary men which has made our gener- 
ation famous, and has included such 
men as Tennyson, Browning, Gladstone, Matthew 
Arnold, Hallam, Newman, Stanley, Shairp, and 
Clough, has suffered sad depletions within the last 
decade. Friendly hands have been prompt to gather 
and publish the scattered memorials of these great 
ones, and " Life and Letters " have become a very 
popular though somewhat sad feature of recent lit- 
erature. One of the best known and best beloved 
within that charmed circle, although not one of the 
most conspicuous as seen from the outside, wtit 
Francis Turner Palgrave, the story of whose life, 
as presented by his daughter, largely through the 
medium of diaries, letters, and tributes of friends, 
makes a highly interesting addition to our knowl- 
edge both of the man himself and of his generation. 
As private secretary first to Mr. Gladstone and after- 
wards to Lord Granville, as art critic to the Sat- 
urday Review," as Professor of Poetry for ten years 
at Oxford, and the author of several books in prose 
and verse, Palgrave is shown to have been a man 
of singularly varied gifts. But it was in the capac- 
ity of compiler that his greatest public service was 
rendered, and the one by which he will be longest 
remembered. The " Golden Treasury of Songs and 
Lyrics " was published first in 1861, and was rec- 
ognized from the beginning as the best existing 
anthology of its kind. Without doubt, this little 
book has taught many, in all ranks of life, to know 
and love much of our best lyrical poetry which other- 
wise might have remained to them obscure and 
neglected. Shortly before his death, in 1897, a

"Second Series" was added, in order to include 
gems written in the thirty-six years since the first 
collection was made. A " Child's Golden Treasury " 
was another of this interesting series of anthologies, 
all displaying the most correct and refined taste, 
and seeming to elevate the humble role of compiler 
almost to the dignity of original or creative work. 
The volume is published handsomely by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co., and a fine portrait head 
of Professor Palgrave forms the frontispiece. 

The lives ^ tnose wno prefer their history in 

of twelve the form of biography, as well as to 

great soldiers. military men, the volume entitled 
" From Cromwell to Wellington," edited by Mr. 
Spenser Wilkinson (Lippincott), will furnish good 
reading. The dozen careful studies embraced in 
its five hundred pages are, with one exception, writ- 
ten by army officers, and consequently show no lack 
of technical knowledge of campaigns and battles. 
The influence of Captain Mahan's writings is, we be- 
lieve, discernible in the emphasis which the book lays 
upon sea power as an all-important element in the 
military history of the British Empire. A second 
lesson which it teaches, as pointed out in the intro- 
duction, is the necessity of England's maintaining 
a thoroughly efficient army to take advantage of her 
naval superiority. Disarmament finds no word in 
its favor in these pages. The overlapping of some 
of the lives as in the case of Baird, Moore, and 
Wellington makes this form of history not the 
most economical of space, although it serves admir- 
ably to emphasize the personal element. The lit- 
erary excellence of the book, as a whole, is perhaps 
a shade less conspicuous than some of its other 
merits ; nor could it well be otherwise. It is hard 
for a writer to give a short sketch of Wolfe, for 
example, which shall be wholly satisfactory to ad- 
mirers of the man as he is seen in the pages of 
Parkman and Thackeray ; or to trace an outline of 
Cromwell's career that shall do him justice in the 
estimation of readers of Carlyle. The portraits 
in the book are good process prints, and the maps 
and plans are numerous, well drawn, and helpful 
to the understanding of the text. 



Lugubrious 
20th century 



After a series of most terrific wars 
in which both the Christian and Mos- 
lem ^rids are involved, the Rev. H. 
Periera Mendes, in his " Looking Ahead : Twen- 
tieth Century Happenings " (Neely), finally gets 
the Jews safely installed in Palestine. The author 
is the pastor of the Spanish and Portuguese Con- 
gregation in New York City, which will in part ex- 
plain what may seem to others to be an anti-climax. 
But even a most conscientious attempt to put one's 
self in the Rev. Mr. Mendes 's place fails to elicit 
from the situation in any of its details quite the 
satisfaction one is sure he intended to have felt at 
the denouement. The book is a prophecy of the 
occurrences likely to fall during the next century. 
They show a human being in control only a little 



less savage than our palaeolithic ancestors, and 
vastly more destructive. We sincerely hope the 
Rev. Mr. Mendes is wrong about everything except 
the settlement of his co-religionists in the land they 
took so unceremoniously from the Philistines in 
days gone by. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Among the hundreds of critical essays written by 
English and American scholars for the " Library of 
the World's Best Literature," there are many of great 
value, which deserve to reach a wider public than that 
made up of owners of the complete work. The Dou- 
bleday & McClure Co. have just made a selection of 
these essays, and published it in a four- volume set of 
small books styled " The Warner Classics." We find 
here Mr. Lecky's Gibbon, Mr. Stephens's Carlyle, Dr. 
Garnett's Emerson, Mr. Warner's Byron, Mr. Norton's 
Dante, Mr. James's Hawthorne, Mr. Trent's Balzac, 
Mr. Brownell's Thackery, Mr. Hutton's Newman, Mr. 
Shorey's Plato, and perhaps a dozen others. The essays 
are classified, one volume containing poets, another 
novelists, another historians and essayists, and another 
philosophers and scientists. 

We have received from Messrs. Luzac & Co., Lon- 
don, a volume of " Oriental Wit and Wisdom," being 
the " Laughable Stories " collected by Mar Gregory 
John Bar-Hebrseus, an ecclesiastical dignitary of the 
thirteenth century. The translation is from the Syriac 
text, previously published by the Messrs. Luzac, and is 
made by Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge, of the British 
Museum. These " laughable stories " are upwards of 
seven hundred in number. The following is a fair ex- 
ample : " Another man had a pain in his stomach, and 
being asked the cause thereof, he said : I have eaten 
largely of a little milk and it hath done me harm.' " 
The wit is not exactly side-splitting. Occasionally, an 
anecdote is too frank for our ears, and is turned into 
discreet Latin instead of English. 

"State Trials, Political and Social" (Macmillan) is 
the title of a work in two small volumes edited by Mr. 
H. L. Stephen. The text consists of an account of ten 
famous trials, and includes lengthy extracts from the 
actual proceedings of the court. These extracts are 
taken from the reports of the Howells, father and 
son, while the editor has supplied the necessary intro- 
ductions and connecting links. The most interesting 
subjects are Raleigh, Charles I., the Regicides, the 
Suffolk Witches, and Alice Lisle. There is a fascina- 
tion about these circumstantial records of which pro- 
fessional historians rarely catch the secret, and students 
of English history will do well to make the acquaint- 
ance of this work. 

"The Treatment of Nature in the Poetry of the 
Roman Republic," by Miss Katharine Allen, is a doc- 
tor's dissertation of the University of Wisconsin, and 
is published as a bulletin of that institution in the 
series devoted to " Philology and Literature." It is a 
painstaking piece of work, with illustrative examples 
carefully classified, and, although the subject has 
frequently before been handled, the present wiiter 
appears to have conducted an independent investigation. 
The monograph extends to over one hundred pages, of 
which Lucretius comes in for nearly one-half, as it is 
entirely proper that he should.

LITERARY NOTES. 

From Messrs. Macmillan Co. we have just re- 
ceived volumes six and seven in the new " Eversley " 
edition of Shakespeare, edited by i'rofessor C. II. 
Her ford. 

41 A Mountain Europa," by Mr. John Fox, Jr., hith- 
erto published as one of a volume of short stories, is 
now reprinted by the Messrs. Harper in a volume by 
itself, with an excellent portrait of the author. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a new and re- 
vised edition of the work of M. Ernest Lefe*bure upon 
" Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and His- 
tory." The translation is by Mr. Alan S. Cole. 

Messrs. Mansfield & Weasels publish a small guide- 
book to " Westminster Abbey," by the Rev. F. W. 
Farrar, to which is added a chapter on the " poets' cor- 
ner" by the bite Dean Stanley. There are several 
illustrations. 

The Duubleday & McClure Co. have just published 
three new volumes in their series of " Little Master- 
pieces," as edited by Mr. Bliss Perry. Thackeray, De 
Quincey, and Lamb are the respective subjects of these 
neat booklets. 

A new biographical series, to be known as " The 
Sock and Buskin Biographies," is announced by Messrs. 
Richard G. Badger & Co. The first volume will be 
devoted to Miss Julia Marlowe, and will be written by 
Mr. John D. Barry. 

Miss Kate M. Warren's version of " Piers Plowman " 
in modern English is a useful little book for beginners 
in the study of our literature, and we are glad to note 
that it has gone into a second edition (Macmillan), 
which has had the benefit of many suggestions from 
Professor W. P. Ker. 

A recent bulletin of the Field Columbian Museum 
describes several new species of plants, among them a 
genus which has been named Higinbothamia, after a 
well-known citizen of Chicago. Since it belongs to the 
Uioseoreaceje, the new plant seems to be a kind of yam. 
It comes from Yucatan. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have just published an 
attractive illustrated edition, in two volumes, of George 
Eliot s " Middlemarch," distinguished, like the other 
publications of that house, by neatness and inexpen- 
siveness. This edition comes in a box. 

The thirteenth volume in Mrs. Garnett's excellent 
translation of the novels of Tourgue*nieff (Maomillan) 
includes "The Diary of a Superfluous Man" and four 
of the other short stories. Two more volumes of short 
stories are yet to follow, and the edition will then be 
complete. 

The Oxford University Press has begun to reissue 
the " New English Dictionary " in monthly parts of 
eighty-eight pages each, at ninety cents a part. This 
means a cent a page, and the entire work will extend 
to about 12,500 pages. It is expected that ten yean 
more will be required for its completion. 

"Manders," that charming novel by Mr. Elwyn Bar- 
ren, the English edition of which was reviewed by us a 
year or so ago, has just been republished in this country 
by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., and we bespeak for it a 
cordial reception. It is much the best piece of literary 
work that Mr. Barron has thus far done. 

The University of Virginia will celebrate the fiftieth 
anniversary of Poe's death on the seventh of this month 



by unveiling a bust of the poet in the library of the 
University. The occasion will be one of great intrrot, 
and visitors from many parts of the country will doubt- 
leu respond to the invitation to be present. 1'oe is 
distinctly a "live" subject at present, and his place 
among our greatest writers becomes every year more 
and more firmly assured. 

Messrs. Curts & Jennings are the publishers of a 
"Life of the Seventh Karl of Shaftesbury," by Miss 
Jennie M. Bingham. The book gives us a simple and 
interesting account of how the famous philanthropist 
abolished child slavery in the mining regions of En- 
gland, how be shortened the hours of labor in the 
factories, 'and threw the broad shield of British law 
over the heads of hundreds of thousands of working 
people." 

Eleven new volumes are this year added by Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. to their popular " Faience " edi- 
tions of favorite books. No less than seven of this num- 
ber are American classics recently out of copyright, 
works by Hawthorne, Emerson, Holmes, Curtis, and 
Thoreau. The others are Mr. Kipling's " Barrack-Room 
Ballads," M. Rostand's "Cyrano," Jean de la Brete's 
" My Uncle and My Curd," and Souvestre's " Attic 
Philosopher." 

Clough was never a popular poet, and it is a little 
startling to receive at the same time four different new 
editions of his poetical works. A brief inspection of 
the volumes, however, clears away the mystery, for 
they all come from the same publisher (Crowell) , and 
are all paged alike. They are, in fact, the same book 
with certain variations in their binding and other me- 
chanical details. There is an excellent memoir, and 
the price is low. 

It is extremely doubtful if Mr. Ruskin's autobiog- 
raphy will ever be completed ; but possessors of the 
incomplete third volume will be able to make up that 
volume, probably. Mr. Allen, the publisher, is pre- 
paring with this object a new edition of " Dilecta " 
(which consists of notes supplementary to the autobi- 
ography). Some unpublished material intended by 
Mr. Ruskin for this latter work will be included, to- 
gether with a comprehensive and elaborate index. 

The " Copley " series is the title given to a new col- 
lection of works of standard literature now in course 
of publication by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. The 
distinctive feature of this series is provided by the col- 
ored illustrations which adorn them. Eight volumes 
have now been published, as follows : " Cranford," 
by Mrs. Gaskell ; " Prue and I," by George Will- 
iam Curtis ; " The House of the Seven Gables," by 
Hawthorne ; " The Abbe Constantin," by M. Hale'vy ; 
" Lucile," by " Owen Meredith " ; " Barrack - Room 
Ballads," by Mr. Rudyard Kipling ; and Longfellow's 
" Evangeline " and " Hiawatha." 

The " What is Worth While " series of white cov- 
ered booklets published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & 
Co. is prettier than ever this year with its columbine 
decorations. Nineteen new numbers of this series have 
just been issued, and their contents are of varied inter- 
cut, ranging from M. Brunetiere's lecture on '-Art and 
Morality " to " Cheerfulness as a Life Power," by Mr. 
O. S. Marden. Two or three of the more serious titles 
are "The Artistic Ordering of Life," by Dr. Albert S. 
Cook ; "The Choice of a College for a Boy, 1 ' by Dr. 
C. F. Tbwing ; and " The Trend of the Century," by 
President Low.

'THE period covered in this volume contains a score of the greatest names in our literary history, and Mr. 

' Mitchell's intimate and incisive characterizations of Hawthorne, Emerson, Holmes, Thoreau, Longfellow, 
Whittier, Bancroft, Poe, and others, are especially notable in view of the importance of the subjects. The 
author's acquaintance with many of these men gives a delightful flavor of autobiography to the book.

last, as we have reason in his preface to infer, now lies

and unflagging sympathy with men and books, a little 
shaded with a certain wistful, half-diffident regret for 
the worthies and standards of long ago, but written in 
a vein of intrinsic grace and charm that even the most 
1 contemporaneous ' minded of the generation whose 
spokesman is Kipling may well relish." The Dial.

THE NEW PATRIOTIC IMPULSE. 



A great deal has been said, during the past 
year, about the rekindling of American patriot- 
ism that has resulted from the war with Spain 
and its sequelce. We are once more a united 
people, and we stand together in the defence of 
the national honor, and new glories have been 
won for the American flag, and we have taken 
our proper place among the great powers, and 
our manifest destiny has again declared itself 
in the impressive deeds by which the triumph of 
our arms has been accomplished. The changes 
have been rung upon all the familiar phrases 
of political oratory, gold and pinchbeck alike, 
and flamboyant boastings from every quarter 
of the land have convinced men only too wil- 
ling to be persuaded that our feet were indeed 
planted upon " glory-crowned heights." The 
emotions to which explosive vent has been given 
are, no doubt, sincere enough to deserve a cer- 
tain measure of respect, even from those who 
know how hollow in reality the most resonant 
phrases may be, and how recklessly the political 
rhetorician will indulge in sentiments to which 
the whole tenor of his career gives the lie. But 
thinking men have never been content, in 
America or elsewhere, to accept at their face 
value the counters of the politician. As was 
recently said in " The Nation," " in the case of 
such men, the proposed sentiments of human- 
ity and morality really count for nothing at all. 
They regard them merely as mouth-filling 
phrases, which sound well and please their con- 
stituents ; and never dream that they will one 
day return to plague them, or that anybody 
will think of holding them to their own pro- 
fessions." And whether such sentiments come 
from some high official like the war-lord of 
Albany, or from the most servile henchman of 
a political party having at bottom no nobler 
motive than party advantage and no higher aim 
than plunder, their ring is false, and will de- 
ceive only those who wish to be deceived. 

The new patriotic impulse to which we here 
wish to call attention finds no illustrations in 
the noisy plaudits of those who din daily into 
our ears the catchwords of duty and destiny 
the duty of advancing civilization by fire and 
sword, the destiny which may only be asserted 
by denying to alien peoples the fundamental 



266 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



rights of man. Rather do we hear through all 
this din the accents of a still small voice recall- 
ing to us that our true duties lie close at hand, 
and that the national destinies wrought out for 
us by Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln 
are absolutely incompatible with our new- 
fangled dreams of empire. And because this 
voice, which is no other than the voice of the 
national conscience, has not breathed out its 
protest unheeded, but has found so many fear- 
less spokesmen, filled with passion for the ideals 
that all true Americans have cherished hitherto, 
and thrilling with indignation at the present 
desecration of those ideals, it has seemed to us 
that this new manifestation of the spirit of the 
finer patriotism is a most noteworthy phenom- 
enon, not to be paralleled more than two or 
three times in the whole course of our history. 
In behalf of this protest against the abandon- 
ment of the principles by which our moral 
stature as a nation has hitherto been deter- 
mined, there has been enlisted, in the words of 
ex-Governor George S. Boutwell, " an array of 
names such as has not been brought together 
in support of a common cause since the signing 
of the Declaration of Independence." So many 
are these names, and so great is their influence 
as leaders of both thought and action, that we 
shall not attempt the invidious task of singling 
out a few for special mention. A score or more 
of them will occur at once to the mind of any 
well-informed reader, and every fair critic must 
admit that they represent an overwhelmning 
preponderance of the intelligence and morality 
of our fellow-citizens. 

The attempt of a time-serving press to attach 
to these names the stigma of treason is one that 
falls with the weight of its own absurdity. This 
position is exactly that of Chatham and Burke 
in opposing another war of subjugation over a 
hundred years ago. It is for the courage of 
their attitude in resisting a perverse and short- 
sighted colonial policy that those men are held 
in the highest honor by Englishmen and Amer- 
icans alike. The verdict of history metes out 
even justice to the men who in any age with- 
stand the outbursts of popular folly ; and who 
can doubt that, in our own present case, when 
" the tumult and the shouting dies," the lead- 
ers who now, at no small cost of temporary 
popularity, stand for the principles of the 
Fathers of our Government, and speak for 
' the mighty hopes that make us men " in a 
sense unknown to European history, will be 
adjudged by no remote posterity to have won 
for themselves a crown of exceeding great 



glory. Whatever may be the outcome of the 
struggle to preserve for this nation the ideals 
upon which its true grandeur has been based 
whether our ship of state reach its haven or 
suffer shipwreck the honor of these men is 
secure. They have fought the good fight, and 
history will set them high among the heroes of 
our race. In a certain sense, the judgment of 
history is already pronounced. What history 
says of any age is determined largely by what 
the most forceful minds of that age have said 
of its issues. The men who are to-day speak- 
ing to us with the authority of experience and 
ripened political wisdom are the men to whom 
the historian of the future will turn for light, 
just as we now turn for light upon the history 
of our Revolutionary struggle to the living 
words of Burke and Chatham, of Washington 
and Jefferson. 

These considerations bring us to the more 
special subject of the present discussion. We 
Americans have a great wealth of political lit- 
erature, for our bent toward the discussion of 
problems of statecraft is as marked as was that 
of the Athenians. Much of this literature is 
mere volubility, and whatever heat it once had 
has long since become dissipated. But the best 
of this literature is still a living force, for it 
deals with the most vital features of our polity, 
and its interest remains perennial. When we 
survey the cherished masterpieces of our polit- 
ical writing its eloquent oratory and its calm 
intellectual appeal we find that they centre 
about two great themes the struggle for 
independence and a national union, and the 
struggle to preserve that union and make it 
stand for freedom in the largest meaning, for 
the equality of all men in the sight of the law. 
It is this latter aspect of the secular conflict 
which now again confronts us, and the cause 
at issue makes upon us a demand no less im- 
perious than the demand that was made upon 
an earlier generation by the harsh pretensions 
of the English crown, and upon a later one by 
the arrogant pretensions of the slave-owning 
oligarchy. He must be blind indeed who does 
not see that the same essential principles are 
now again at stake, and that the outcome of the 
present deplorable situation is fraught with the 
same enormous possibilities for good or for evil. 

In this serious condition of affairs, our writers 
have not been found wanting, and it is with the 
deepest satisfaction that we call attention to 
the way in which they have risen to the high 
occasion offered them. There is growing up 
about the present subject of contention a mass 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



of literature which is conceived in accordance 
with the noblest traditions of American thought. 
Even in mere bulk it is already almost com- 
parable with the literature inspired by oppo- 
sition to the institution of slavery, and in quality 
it is no whit inferior, either in its impassioned 
earnestness or in its deep resolve to maintain 
to the death those standards of justice and 
human right that so many seem now to be 
weakly forsaking. The thought which infuses 
all this writing is indeed that which 

" Bade our fathers' souls to live, 
And bids the dying century bloom anew." 

It is the thought of men too sturdy in their 
Americanism to be swept away from their 
moorings by the gusts of partisan folly, and too 
sure that they are right to be influenced by any 
array of hostile numbers. It is the thought 
of men each one of whom would be content to 
stand with serene conscience an Aihanasius 
contra mundum, each one of whom would re- 
echo the " Ultima Verba " of Victor Hugo, 

"Sans cherchera savoir et sans considerer 
Si quelqn'un a pli6 qu'on aurait era plus f erme, 
Et si plusieurs s'en vont qui devraient demeurer." 

The defenders of our latter-day imperialism 
have not yet come to understand the temper 
of this opposition to their reckless course. 
They treat it as a difference of opinion, but it 
is nothing of the sort. Men may have opinions 
about such matters as the tariff and the cur- 
rency, but the proposition to cast aside the 
doctrines of the Constitution and the Declara- 
tion, the counsels of Washington and Lincoln, 
the sanctions of free government that have been 
inculcated upon Americans from their earliest 
childhood this proposition runs counter to 
the most sacred convictions of all men to whom 
Americanism is more than an empty name. 

Let us enumerate a few a very few of 
the writings that have responded to this wild 
onslaught upon the principles that make the 
American name dear to us. There are the 
lectures and addresses contained in President 
Jordan's "Imperial Democracy," a volume 
which is a complete arsenal of fact and argu- 
ment. There are such papers as "The Present 
Crisis," by Edwin D. Mead; "Our Nation's 
Peril," by Dr. Lewis G.Janes; "Imperialism, 
and the Tracks of Our Forefathers," by Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams; "England in 1776: 
America in 1899," by Mr. William M. Salter ; 
and " The Conquest of the United States by 
Spain," by Professor William G. Sumner. 
There are such speeches as that of Senator 
Hoar in Congress, of Mr. Carl Schurz before 
the University of Chicago, of Professor Charles 



Eliot Norton at the Ashfield Dinner. There 
are such fugitive writings as the "Open Let- 
ter" from ex-Senator Henderson, and "The 
Philippine Piracy," by Professor William 
James. There are innumerable other contri- 
butions to this literature of protest and warn- 
ing, offered by such men as President Eliot, 
Professor von Hoist, Bishop Henry C. Potter, 
Bishop John L. Spaulding, Professor Felix 
Adler, and the Rev. Henry Van Dyke. Now, 
of all this literature it is not enough to say 
that it cannot be ignored. Much of it is so 
admirable in form, besides being suffused with 
the lasting qualities of fine intelligence and 
exalted emotion, that it is sure of preserva- 
tion among the most noteworthy examples of 
American patriotic eloquence. The future 
student and compiler of such literature will be 
justified in placing Senator Hoar's speech of 
last February beside Webster's reply to Hayne, 
and Professor Sumner's Phi Beta Kappa ad- 
dress beside the finest efforts of his great name- 
sake. One reads these masterly productions 
with the same glow of feeling that is inspired 
by the traditional models of our eloquence, and 
the youth of the future will take from them the 
same contagion of enthusiasm which our gene- 
ration has caught from their old-time pro- 
totypes. Their present value is that they 
strengthen our faith in the potency of our 
cherished ideals, and bid us take heart for our 
country however dark the present outlook. 
What to the faint-hearted may seem one sweep- 
ing degringolade of principles and institutions 
cannot, after all, be a reality as long as such 
voices as these are raised to recall us to the old 
paths of national virtue and sobriety. " This 
spasm of folly and delusion also, in my judg- 
ment, will surely pass by," are among the 
closing words of Senator Hoar's memorable 
speech. And what true American should not 
be proud to echo the words that follow: 
" Whether it passes by or not, I thank God 
I have done my duty, and that I have adhered 
to the great doctrines of righteousness and 
freedom, which I learned from my fathers, 
and in whose service my life has been spent." 
Such a literature as this makes us almost 
glad that the occasion for it has arisen. The 
awakening from our fancied security has been 
rude, and the perils to which we are exposed 
have become imminent ; but we now know, at 
least, that the voices that were raised in past 
crises of our national life have found worthy 
successors, and that the torch has been handed 
on still aflame. The poets, indeed, we sadly

miss, for we know with what prophetic fire our 
Whittier, were he now alive, would arouse our 
sluggish conscience, and our Lowell scourge 
with the scorpion whip of his indignation the 
traduoers of our national character. But the 
words of the poets have this advantage over 
all common words, that they apply to other 
times and places than those by which they are 
immediately occasioned, and neither " Ichabod" 
nor the " Biglow Papers " could in reality be 
bettered for our present needs. What, in fact, 
could a Lowell now say that would be more 
exactly to the point than these familiar stanzas, 
and the note by which they are supplemented : 

" We were gittin* on nicely up here to oar village, 

With good old idee* o 1 wut ' right an* wot aint, 
We kind o' thought Christ went agin war an' pillage, 
An' thet eppyletts worn't the best mark of a saint ; 
Bat John P. 
Robinson he 
Sex this kind o 1 thing *s an exploded idee. 

" The side of oar country mast oilers be took, 

An 1 President Polk, yoa know, he is oar country. 
An* the angel that writes all oar sins in a book 
Puts the debit to him, and to us the per contry ; 
And John P. 
Robinson he 
Sex this is his view o' the thing to a T." 

" Our country is bounded on the north and the south, 
on the east and the west, by Justice, and when she over- 
steps that invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair's- 
breadth, she ceases to be our mother, and chooses to be 
looked upon quasi noverca. That is a hard choice when 
our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one 
path and our duty points us to another. We most make 
as noble and becoming an election as did Penelope be- 
tween Icarius and Ulysses. Veiling our faces, we must 
take silently the hand of Duty to follow her." 



THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN 
GERMANY. 

Germany has done more to promote the critical 
study of English than the whole Anglo-Saxon race 
besides. Hanover, by reason of her political rela- 
tions with England, and of the rich literary gifts 
that Goettingen received from London, made the 
start. The first German professor to take an 
interest in English was Hof rath Reuss, the Goettin- 
gen University librarian, who in 1770 published a 
book on the living writers of the British Isles and 
America. Somewhat later Boutewek, a Goettingen 
professor of philosophy, wrote a work on Middle 
and Modern English literature. But greater than 
the influence of these two professors was that of 
the celebrated scholar C. Heyne, perhaps the most 
distinguished philologist of his day. His influence, 
however, was not direct, bat indirect He pre- 
pared the way by applying the methods which have 
made modern philology so important a factor in uni- 
versity work. Heyne's successor was Benecke, who 



became a Goettingen professor in 1805, and shares 
with Lachmann the honor of having made Germany 
acquainted with the poets of the first golden age of 
German literature. Although professor of German, 
his lectures on Spenser and Shakespeare and his crit- 
ical work in Middle English show him to have been 
well informed in both English literature and English 
philology. His students were so eager to learn En- 
glish that they did not object to meet their professor 
as early as six o'clock in the morning. 

The next important German scholar of English 
was W. A. von Schlegel, whose translation of 
Shakespeare is one of the best in any language. 
Since his day, neither the German Goethe nor 
Schiller heads the long list of dramatists whose 
works constitute the repertoire of the royal theatres 
of Germany, but the English Shakespeare. Schle- 
gel's epoch-making lectures on dramatic art, which 
brought him a call to the newly founded university 
of Bonn, were directly translated into English, and 
were made by Coleridge, sometime student of 
Goettingen, the basis of a new Shakespearian criti- 
cism. From the time of Schlegel to 1872, which may 
be considered the beginning of the present import- 
ant period of the study of English in Germany, 
most of the professors who worked particularly 
with literature gave their time to Shakespeare. 
The first of this long list of critics is Huber, well 
known as author of " English Universities." In 
the thirties he lectured in Marburg on Shakespeare ; 
and in the forties he delivered in Berlin, to which 
University he had been called, the first course of 
German lectures ever delivered on Chaucer. Near 
the close of the first half of this century there 
appeared Gervinus's great work on Shakespeare, a 
work which first applied the methods that character- 
ize German critical contributions to English litera- 
ture. Other names worthy of mention here are 
Hattner, Herrig, Keller, Vischer, Rapp, Wolf, Ulrici, 
and Flathe, all of whom gave more attention to 
Shakespeare than to any other English author. 

The father of German as well as of English 
philology was Jacob Grimm. His grammar, which 
appeared in 1819, may be regarded as one of the 
greatest contributions to modern philology. Al- 
though the first important contribution to Teutonic 
philology, its fourth volume, " Teutonic Syntax," 
remains to-day the only comprehensive work on 
the subject, and will hold its place until the appear- 
ance of Roethe's new edition of the same and the 
completion of Wilmann's German grammar. Pro- 
fessor Schmid of Jena studied Grimm's grammar 
five years, and then published, in 1832, the Old 
English Laws." The long list of professors who 
based their investigations on the results of Grimm 
worked with Old English in general and " Beowulf" 
in particular. The most important of this list are 
Leo and Ettmueller, well known to scholars of En- 
glish philology. Somewhat later, we have Grein, 
Muellenhoff, Delius, Maetzner, Koch, and Heyne. 
Of these six celebrated philologists, all of whose 
works are indispensable to-day, Dr. Heyne, pro-

only one living. His valuable text-books in several 
of the Teutonic languages have made him as famil- 
iar to the American and English student of modern 
philology as he is to the German student. 

Until 1872, English literature and English phi- 
lology were separate. A professor gave his time 
either to the one or the other. It would be difficult 
to find a man who made valuable contributions to 
both. Then, too, English philology and literature 
were combined either with Teutonic philology and 
literature or with Romance philology and literature. 
In 1872 Strassburg was opened and the first chair 
of English was endowed. The other larger uni- 
versities followed, and to-day nearly all the German 
academic institutions have chairs of English. In 
1873 Ten Brink was called from Marburg to 
Strassburg, where he filled the chair of English 
until his death, five years ago. Ten Brink and 
his great contemporary Zupitza (who began as 
classical philologist and " Germanist," and held 
the chair of English in Berlin from 1876 to 1895, 
the year of his death) did more to advance the 
study of English than any other German scholars. 
Many well-known philologists in Germany, as well 
as in England and America, owe the inspiration 
they received to these two men. Ten Brink did 
the Anglo-Saxon race a great service by his import- 
ant contributions to English criticism, and Zupitza 
will be remembered as one of the great scholars in 
Old and Middle English. Zupitza was the first 
German to assist the Early English Text Society. 
Important contemporaries of these two men were 
Barnay, EIze, Mall, and Schipper. 

The past decade marks a great period in the 
German study of English. German scholars are 
applying to English, more assiduously than ever, 
the methods that have made German what it is. 
The men who are doing the English work to-day 
are Wuelker and Sievers of Leipsic, Brandl of 
Berlin, Schipper of Vienna, Morsbach of Goettin- 
gen, Koeppel of Strassburg, Trautmann of Bonn, 
Koelbing of Breslau, Sarrazin of Kiel, and Victor 
of Marburg. Of these scholars, Sievers and Mors- 
bach are the greatest philologists. The former's 
Old English grammar and the latter's Middle 
English grammar, have revolutionized the study of 
the first two periods of English philology. Trautmann 
and Vietor are particularly known because of their 
work in phonetics. Sarrazin, Koeppel, and Brandl 
have made very important contributions to English 
criticism. Schipper is the greatest authority on 
English metre. Wuelker as editor of " Anglia " 
and Koelbing as editor of " Englische Studien " 
have worked in both English philology and English 
literature. 

Both England and America learned from Ger- 
many how to study scientifically their mother 
tongue, and it is a pleasing fact that Germany is 
making such rapid progress in her investigations 
in the greatest of modern languages and richest 
of modern literatures. E. I. ANTRIM. 



MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.* 



The name of John Murray Forbes is not so 
familiar to his countrymen at large as it ought 
to be, or as it would be had his great public 
services been coupled with official position. 
The part played by Mr. Forbes in public affairs, 
especially during the period of the Civil War, 
was an important and effective one; but he 
never held, nor sought, political office. What 
he did for his country he did as a private citi- 
zen, and in the most private way possible ; his 
maxim being, " Never mind who does it or gets 
the credit for it, so long as the thing is done." 
Political ambition can hardly, in a republic, 
be accounted an alloy in the motives that impel 
a man to serve his country ; but it is, never- 
theless, always refreshing to meet the rarer, or 
at least seemingly rarer, brand of patriotism 
that neither voter nor tax-payer is ever ex- 
pected to requite or pay for. 

It was as a pioneer and manager of Western 
or Middle- Western railroads that Mr. Forbes 
was best known to the American public. He 
was one of the founders of each of those great 
lines, the Michigan Central and the Chicago, 
Burlington & Quincy. Of the latter company 
he was president from 1878 to 1881, and he 
was one of its directors from 1857 until his 
death, in October, 1898. The earlier years of 
Mr. Forbes's business career were spent in 
China. In 1837 he returned finally to America, 
and established himself at Boston as a mer- 
chant in the China trade. In view of his sub- 
sequent field of commercial operations, a letter 
of his (1836) as to railway investments is 
amusing. 

"The principal object of the present is to request 
that you will by no means invest any funds of mine in 
railway stocks, and to advise you to keep clear of them. 
I have good reasons to believe, from all I can learn of 
the English railways, that ours will prove a failure after 
the first few years; the wear and tear proves ruinous. 
At any rate, keep clear of them." 

Ten years later we find Mr. Forbes embarking 
cautiously on his first railway venture the 
purchase, with several copartners, among them 
Erastus Corning, from the State of Michigan 
of its quarter-built road (the germ of the future 
Michigan Central) at seventy-five cents on the 
dollar. Writing in 1884 of these early opera- 
tions, Mr. Forbes says :

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



" Like a young bear, with all my troubles before me, 
I had plunged into the railroad vortex, aud on June 11, 
1847, I find by my letter-books that I was at Milwau- 
kee with the other Michigan Central directors, we 
having decided to take our road round to Chicago, 
instead of trusting to New Buffalo and water carriage 
on the lake for our Western outlet. It was oo this trip 
that W. B. Ogden drove us about Chicago and tried to 
coax us into rapid action by offering us land in that city, 
for which he was the selling agent, at low prices. The 
land below the harbor on the lake was then a sand-drift 
and might have been bought very low, but the cheapest 
purchases would have been the wet prairie lands within 
a mile of the hotel where we stopped, which were offered 
ns at $1.25 per acre. Sheltered by our absurd preju- 
dices against laud, we were proof against Ogden's 
seductions, and I do not think any of us ever bought a 
foot of land in Chicago for ourselves while the road was 
in course of construction. My hotel bill of 8125 would 
have bought 100 acres, now worth 98,000,000 to 
$12,000,000." 

In 1852 Mr. Forbes, still busy with the 
Michigan Central, and also with the small 
roads forming the embryo of the future Chi- 
cago, Burlington and Quincy, had undertaken 
the " very trying enterprise of building the 
Hannibal and St. Joseph road, to connect the 
Mississippi and Missouri rivers." Possibly too 
intent, up to 1856, on the management of the 
Michigan Central (the presidency of which he 
resigned in 1857), Mr. Forbes does not seem 
to have foreseen the impending financial crash 
of 1857, largely due to the overbuilding of 
Western railroads. About the middle of Sep- 
tember the storm struck Boston, as may be 
gathered from Mr. Forbes's letter to a foreign 
correspondent, September 28, 1857. 

" We are in such a crisis here as only those who went 
through 1837 can conceive of. ... New York Central 
has run down from 87 to 55, and Michigan Central 
from 95 to 45, while the weaker concerns are clear out 
of sight Erie 10, Southern Michigan 10-15. Having 
taken in sail, not expecting a storm, but out of pure 
laziness, I am very easy unless other people swamp me." 

In the following month Mr. Forbes went to 
London and secured a loan, on onerous terms, 
of two million dollars to fend off the threatened 
bankruptcy of the Michigan Central. His own 
view of the policy which had gotten the road 
in straits was as follows : 

" Somehow the directors had taken the view that the 
high rates for money in the streets were only tempo- 
rary; and so for the needful construction and other 
outlays they had allowed the company to incur a heavy 
floating debt instead of selling stock and bonds to meet 
their outlays." 

The Michigan Central shortly afterward 
passed into New York hands, and Mr. Forbes 
sold out his interest therein at a very moderate 
profit, his real gain being that fund of ex- 
perience which was to prove so valuable to the 



then rapidly developing Chicago, Burlington 
and Quincy road. As a manager of great 
business enterprises, Mr. Forbes was well char- 
acterized by a former partner in China. 

' He never seemed to me a man of acquisitiveness, 
but very distinctly one of constructiveness. His wealth 
was only an incident. I have seen many occasions when 
much more money might have been made by him in 
some business transaction but for this dominant passion 
for building up things. The good, also, which he an- 
ticipated for workmen and settlers through opening up 
the country always weighed much with him." 

Mr. Forbes's absorbing interest in politics 
began and grew with the slavery controversy. 
Prior to 1850 he was a Whig. But in that 
year Webster's Fugitive Slave Law speech 
gave a sharp turn to the current of his political 
thought, and he gave up his old party, becom- 
ing a Republican, or " Free-Soiler," with abo- 
litionist leanings, which, with the progress of 
the war, took shape in his ardent and effective 
advocacy of the emancipation measure. In 
1859 he entertained over night at his Milton 
home a notable visitor none other than John 
Brown of Ossawattomie, already under the ban 
of the law and of a large and violent section of 
opinion. Mr. Forbes's account of his guest is 
interesting. 

Captain Brown was a grim, farmer-like looking 
man with a long gray beard and glittering gray-blue 
eyes which seemed to me to have a little touch of 
insanity in them. I did all I could to draw the old 
mau out and make him talk, first politics and then 
about bis adventures in Kansas. He repelled, almost 
with scorn, my suggestion that firmness at the ballot- 
box by the North and West might avert the storm ; and 
said it had passed the stage of ballots, and that nothing 
but bullets would settle it now. . . . Leading him back 
into Kansas by asking him about the battle of Ossawat- 
tomie, he replied, in his jerky way of throwing out his 
words, 'That wasn't any battlel 'twas all on one side'; 
and then he told me that on that day he had been roused 
by having his son killed by the Missouri border ruffians, 
and another son dragged at their horses' heels all day 
in the sun, until he was nearly frantic ; he had raised a 
small force (I think only thirty) to watch the invaders, 
and perhaps get a chance to strike a blow at them. 
Waiting on the edge of a large swamp, through which 
he could at any time retreat, be saw the enemy coming 
along careless and confident. ' How many, Captain 
Brown?' 'Wai, they said there was 270 of them.' 
When they were at close range his little band poured 
in a volley, and they completely lost their heads, while 
be repeated the attack. At last they realized how 
small the Free-Soil force was and made a serious at- 
tempt to attack it, and then Captain Brown just scuttled 
off through the swamp without much or any loss. ' How 
many did you kill ? ' we asked. ' Wai, they said we 
hurt seventy of 'em.' . . . The Captain had to go to 
town by the earliest train. . . . When our parlor girl 
got up early to open the bouse, she was startled by 
finding the grim old soldier sitting bolt upright in the 
front entry, fast asleep; and when her light awoke him

he sprang up and put his hand into his breast-pocket, 
where I have no doubt his habit of danger led him to 
carry a revolver." 

Some six months later came John Brown's 
capture at Harper's Ferry and its tragic sequel. 

As a presidential Elector - at - large, Mr. 
Forbes signed the certificate of his State's 
election of Lincoln in 1861. What he then 
thought of the successful candidate appears 
in a letter to Mr. Senior. 

" From such of them [Lincoln's speeches] as I have 
read, I get the idea that he is an earnest, rough, quick- 
witted man, persistent and determined, half educated, 
but self-reliant and self-taught. . . . Those who know 
him assure me that he is honest and straight-forward 
and owned by no clique of hackneyed politicians." 

How late it was before Lincoln's greatness was 
really recognized even by those who thought 
and acted with him politically, we know; and 
let us turn here, as to an interesting freak of 
contemporary opinion, to an extract from a 
letter (1862) from Mr. W. P. Fessenden to 
Mr. Forbes, which now reads, in the light of 
the easy wisdom that comes after the event, 
almost like a sort of blasphemy. 

"You cannot change the President's character or 
conduct, unfortunately; he remained long enough at 
Springfield, surrounded by toadies and office-seekers, to 
persuade himself that he was specially chosen by the 
Almighty for this great crisis, and well-chosen. This 
conceit has not yet been beaten out of him, and until it 
is, no human wisdom can be of much avail." 

An interesting opinion of Lincoln and his 
policy is found in a letter to Mr. Forbes (1883) 
of the former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 
G. V. Fox. 

" His playing with ' peace negotiations ' in 1864 was 
a repetition of that profound and secretive policy which 
marked his course with regard to Fort Sumter in 1861. 
Many of the leaders, even those close to him, thought 
him to be a < simple-minded man.' He was the deepest, 
the closest, the cutest, and the most ambitious man 
American politics has produced." 

While Mr. Forbes seems not to have quite 
appreciated or done justice to Mr. Lincoln's 
character and abilities, he nevertheless worked 
hard for his reelection in 1864 ; and apropos 
of this fact a characteristic anecdote, contrib- 
uted by Mr. Edward Atkinson, may be given. 

" At Mr. Forbes's instance a meeting was called for 
the purpose of raising money for the second Lincoln 
campaign. It was held in a large side office, of which 
I had the control. Some fifteen or twenty men came 
in. After the hour had been reached, Mr. Forbes sug- 
gested to me to lock the door, and we looked around 
the meeting. He said, ' How much is this meeting good 
for?' I replied, 'About twenty thousand dollars.' 
' Well,' said he, don't unlock the door until we have 
got it.' The matter was discussed, and in his usual 
manner he led off with a large subscription, and before 
we unlocked the door we had twenty-three thousand 



dollars. He always led on any line that he thought 
others should follow." 

It is impossible to specify fully here the 
many good works done by Mr. Forbes for the 
cause he had so deeply at heart during the war. 
Head, hand, and purse, he was always at the 
service of his country. He was Governor 
Andrew's unofficial right-hand man and confi- 
dential adviser, taking for a time full charge 
of the work of moving, feeding, and clothing 
the State troops. He was active in organizing 
the Sanitary Commission, and in enlisting the 
colored troops a measure which he strongly 
urged upon the Government as the logical and 
expedient sequel of emancipation. He wrote 
and inspired leaders in the press, and was 
tireless in the work of disseminating right 
views of the cause and the aims of the North, 
both at home and abroad. He was in close 
touch and constant correspondence with the 
heads of the departments at Washington, who 
sought his advice chiefly in matters of shipping 
and finance. It is hardly too much to say that 
he was for a time virtually an unofficial or ad- 
visory member of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet. His 
philosophy of the war was, as may be gathered 
from a letter to Mr. Lincoln in 1863, that it 
was fundamentally a struggle, a phase of the 
historic and enduring struggle, between aris- 
tocracy (or, better, oligarchy) and democracy, 
the originators and natural supporters of seces- 
sion, the planting aristocracy and its economic 
parasites, numbering in the insurgent States 
about 28,000 persons, out of a total of 5,000,000 
persons. Said Mr. Forbes : 

" The next great want is to get the public mind of 
the North, and of such part of the South as you can 
reach, right upon the true issue of the existing struggle. 
. . . Our friends abroad see it. John Bright and his 
glorious baud of English republicans see that we are 
fighting for democracy: or (to get rid of the technical 
name) for liberal institutions. . . . Our enemies, too, 
see it in the same light. The aristocrats and the despots 
of the Old World see that our quarrel is that of the 
people against an aristocracy. . . . My suggestion, 
then, is that you should seize an early opportunity to 
teach your great audience of plain people that the war is 
not the North against the South, but the people against 
the aristocrats. . . . Let the people North and South 
see this line clearly defined between the people and the 
aristocrats, and the war will be over." 

In 1863 Mr. Forbes was sent by the Federal 
Government to England with instructions to 
block (through private negotiations) the pro- 
gress or change the destination of the cruisers 
then notoriously building in English shipyards 
for the use of the Confederacy. Credits to the 
amount of 1,000,000 sterling were placed at 
his disposal, and these he was to use largely at

his own discretion. Mr. Forbes failed, as we 
know, to purchase or to secure a lien upon the 
cruisers, according to his specific mandate ; but 
that his representations to prominent English- 
men that the sailing of the rams (as Mr. Adams 
put it) meant war " between the United States 
and England eventually went far in accomplish- 
ing the main end aimed at, there is good evi- 
dence. While in England Mr. Forbes, it ap- 
pears, wrote a private letter to Mr. Rathbone, 
a leading Liverpool merchant and member of 
Parliament, explicitly stating that if the Laird 
rams sailed war would ensue. What followed 
is related by Mr. Rathbone in a letter of 1898. 
I went straight up to London, saw Mr. Thomas 
Baring, Mr. Cobden, Mr. Forster, and others at * break- 
fast for the purpose at Mr. Baring's. They realized 
at once the danger of the crisis, and urged me to see 
Lord Palmerston. I was perfectly astonished at the 
ignorance of our statesmen generally, and of Lord 
Palmerston in particular, as to the inevitable effect a 
maritime war would have on a commerce like ours. . . . 
I was able to meet all Lord Palmerston's remarks and 
suggestions from information that had come to my 
knowledge as a shipowner and a very close student of 
laws bearing upon the state of our mercantile marine. 
. . . He said he quite realized the importance of the 
facts I had laid before him, and listened with very 
great patience; and when I had concluded, asked me 
whether there were any other points which I wished to 
suggest. I said I thought I bad laid before him suf- 
ficient to show that the sailing of the < rams ' meant war 
with America and the destruction of our mercantile 
marine. Three days afterwards the ' rams ' were stopped, 
and purchased by the government. . . . And I have 
always believed that the Messrs. Forbes's letters and 
Mr. John Forbes's previous exertions in favor of peace 
prevented a war between the two countries." 

Acknowledging Mr. Forbes's services, after 
the termination of his mission to England, 
Secretary Welles wrote : 

"Generously refusing all compensation for your per- 
sonal services, you in a great emergency promptly, and 
with much inconvenience to yourselves,* entered with 
alacrity upon the mission confided to you, and the de- 
partment has reason to be satisfied with the intelligent 
and judicious manner in which its duties were dis- 
charged." 

The foregoing quotations may perhaps serve 
to measurably justify the length at which Mr. 
Forbes's career is set forth in the two well- 
made and impeccably printed volumes from 
which they are taken. As to the origin and 
elements of the volumes, a word must now be 
said. They consist largely, as the title implies, 
of Mr. Forbes's correspondence with public 
men on public questions at a very critical 
period of the nation's history. They thus pos- 
sess an interest apart from and perhaps superior

colleague in the English mission. 



to their biographical interest. The light they 
occasionally shed on the characters of public 
men of the day, and especially on the opinions 
that public men of the day had of each other's 
characters, is decidedly useful. The autobio- 
graphical element of the work has been culled 
by the editor, Mr. Forbes's daughter and the 
custodian of his papers, from "a couple of vol- 
umes of reminiscences of his life " composed 
twelve years ago. The editor, who has done 
her work throughout in a workmanlike and 
tactful way, supplies a graceful and touching 
introductory chapter on her father's habits and 
characteristics. " I publish these things," she 
adds at the close of the preface, as the record 
of an American citizen who, keeping himself 
in the background, never stinted work, or 
money, or service of any sort, for the country 
he loved so well." The impression to be gained 
from these volumes of the sterling character of 
this genial and public-spirited citizen forms a 
valuable acquisition for any man. " He was," 
as his friend Emerson said of him, an Ameri- 
can to be proud of." . 6. J. 



AN ORIGINAL, ENGLISH GRAMMAR.* 

Dr. Oram Lyte's " Advanced Grammar and 
Composition "ought to please the class of teach- 
ers that like to find in an English grammar a 
little of everything. Those that get tired of 
teaching one thing at a time, and want vari- 
ety, will certainly not be disappointed in this 
book. Here are principles of grammar, of rhet- 
oric, of composition, including " Letter Writ- 
ing, Narratives, Biographical and Historical 
Sketches, Descriptions, Essays, Debates, Busi- 
ness Papers, etc." (see Preface), Etymology, 
History of the English Language, False Syn- 
tax, Punctuation, Use of Capitals, Rules of 
Spelling, Analysis, Language Tables, Figures 
of Speech, Diaries and Journals, Orations, Pre- 
fixes, Suffixes and Roots, Dialogues and Short 
Stories, Mathematical Constructions, Poetical 
Constructions, Abbreviated and Irregular Con- 
structions, Miscellaneous Subjects, Miscellane- 
ous Notes, and no, strangely enough, there 
is nothing on Prosody. 

There ought not to be any demand for such 
a hodge-podge, except, perhaps, in the most 
remote rural districts. Teachers in search of 
" constructive work" may find excellent manuals

of composition suited to the needs of pupils of all 
grades, while the numerous editions of English 
classics which, thanks to modern pedagogy, 
every publisher of school-books is sending out, 
for every age and condition, will furnish any 
variety of interesting themes and material for 
composition. 

The study of English grammar must, from 
the nature of the subject, be analytical. It is 
a study of relation, mainly of function. The 
sentence as a whole is known and understood 
long before the pupil is able to grasp the gram- 
matical relation of its parts ; he must, there- 
fore, proceed from the whole to its parts, and 
this is the analytic method. In the study of 
Latin grammar or the grammar of any foreign 
tongue, the process is just the reverse ; the 
pupil proceeds from the parts to the whole, 
because it is easier to comprehend the part than 
the whole, and the synthetic is, of course, the 
right method. It is poor pedagogy that would 
confound the two things. In the study of En- 
glish there is plenty of " constructive work " to 
be done outside of the grammar. 

The author is undoubtedly right when he 
says : " The time has gone by when the study 
of English grammar is condemned by thought- 
ful teachers. . . . No other study can take its 
place." Only, we would insist that it be gram- 
mar, and not something else in grammar cloth- 
ing. 

The grammatical part of this book proceeds 
in an orderly way as far as page 52, when it 
is interrupted by the insertion of two or three 
pages on Letter Writing, and is again resumed 
on page 55. If the book were intended for the 
use of American schools in the Philippines, the 
following paragraph would seem to be more 
pertinent. 

" How do letters get to the persons for whom they 
are intended ? Why are they put in envelopes ? Why 
must they be stamped ? What is the value of the stamp 
placed on an envelope ? Where is it put ? " 

But as the author assures us in the Preface 
that the book " is intended to meet the require- 
ments of high schools, normal schools, and 
academies," we suggest that some such instruc- 
tion as this would be more to the point : 

Always enclose a stamp except in love-letters. 
Do n't lick the corner of the stamp and stick 
it to the sheet of paper on which you write. 
The enlightened do n't do that. After folding 
your letter put the stamp in loose. No person 
accustomed to receiving letters will let it escape 
on opening the letter. If you have only two 
stamps and are writing to your teacher for your 



grades or a testimonial, don't reserve one of 
the stamps in order to thank your teacher. That 
is unnecessary. Drop the stamp in your first 
letter, in which you may express your thanks 
in advance. The government has not yet ex- 
tended the franking privilege to teachers, and 
Boards do not furnish stamps. 

But to return to the grammar. It would be 
quite impossible to point out all the errors ; 
that would require another book. We must 
content ourselves with a few samples here and 
there. 

Under " Verbals used as adjectives," two 
examples will suffice : 

"2. A soldier lay dying. 3. The slate used for roof- 
ing houses is a kind of stone." 

Under " Verbals used as Adverbs ": 
" 3. Hearing a noise, I looked around." 

Comment is unnecessary. 

"271. Some clauses have only two essential parts, 
the subject and the predicate. They are called abridged 
clauses. Examples. I desire him to go. Spring having 
come, all nature is clothed in beauty. Let him go." 

This seems to be entirely original. 

" In construing hers in ' This book is hers,' supply 
book. In construing yours in 'Yours is lost,' 'This is 
yours,' supply possession or property." 

Old-field teachers of grammar, if there are any 
left, will be delighted with this reversion to 
grammar in its rudimentary stage. 

One of the special features of the work to 
which attention is invited in the Preface is : 

' 9. The treatment of the objective case." 

Turning to the Objective Case (p. 149), we 
find this startling statement : 

" Nouns and pronouns that modify verbs, verbals, 
adjectives, and adverbs are called the objects of the 
words that they modify." 

As this will be unintelligible to many readers, 
an illustration is here given from another part 
of the book : 

"Ago. 'She died eleven years ago '; adv. (Years, 
a. o. of ago). He staid till a few minutes ago '; obj. 
of till. (Minutes, a. o. of ago.) " 

The reader may like to know that a. o. stands 

for adverbial object. 

Returning now to p. 157, we read : 
" Rule 7. A noun or a pronoun used as the adverbial 

object of a verb, a verbal, an adjective, or an adverb, 

is in the objective case." 

Here is another dash of originality, unintel- 
ligible, to the reviewer at least : 

" In ' The Cretans were believed to be liars,' the 
form of were believed is determined by the subject of 
the abridged clause. Cretans may therefore be called 
the subject of were believed, though it is not the entire 
subject." 



274 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



What is lacking? And where is the clause? 
Any pupil who has passed into the high school 
should know it is the predicate, rather than the 
subject, that is made complete by the infinitive 
phrase. 

Now let us turn to the author's treatment of 
Mood, the crucial test of the grammatical ama- 
teur: 

" Mood is a variation in the use and form of a verb 
to show the manner in which an act or state is expressed 
with reference to the person or thing represented by 
its subject." 

This is a little disappointing after the author's 
positive assurance of " the accuracy and sim- 
plicity of the definitions." 

"There are six moods: the indicative, the sudjunctive, 
the potential, the infinitive, and the participial." 

The author evidently does not intend to be out- 
done by anybody. 

" A verb in the indicative mood is used in expressing 
a fact." 

It would have been nearer the truth to say : A 
verb in the indicative mood is used in express- 
ing a falsehood ; as no sane man ever tells a 
lie in the subjunctive mood. Mood has no more 
to do with fact than with tact, not so much ; 
and whoever confounds mood with fact has not 
the faintest conception of mood. 

" The fact may sometimes be referred to as a doubt; 
as, ' If Saturn is large, Jupiter is larger." 

A logical conditional, in which there is no 
shadow of a doubt, any more than in " If he 
is breathing, he is living." 

" A verb in the potential mood is used in expressing 
power, permission, possibility, compulsion, duty, inclin- 
ation, or a wish. Examples. < I can go,' etc." 

This will rejoice the heart of the few veterans 
who still linger on to do battle for their cher- 
ished " potential." Mood is confounded this 
time with the meaning of the verb. Whatever 
potentiality there is lies in the meaning of can, 
with which mood has nothing to do. In " I 
doubt the truth of the statement," doubt is ex- 
pressed, to be sure, but the mood is indicative. 
But why stop with the " potential " ? If mood 
has to do with the meaning of the verb, why 
not make other categories, and extend them 
indefinitely ? For instance, we might call I 
will go " the volential mood, " I beg you to 
go " the deferential mood, " I am sorry I went " 
the penitential mood, and so on. There would 
be no limit to this sort of thing, and it might 
serve as a useful exercise in invention, just as 
in the case of the author's participial mood, 
which, so far as we know, is entirely original. 
But granting the potentiality of can go, what 



is there potential in would go, should go, etc.? 
For illustration, let us take three examples of 
the use of would : 

(a). He would tell, if he knew (diceret . . . tciret). 

(6). He would tell the same joke every year (nar- 
rabat). 

(c). He would not tell (nolebat dicere). 

Now any grammatical instruction that con- 
founds these three uses of would, to go no fur- 
ther, is simply pernicious, and utterly useless 
as a discipline. 

" A verb in the present tense of the imperative mood 
refers to future time; as, Charge, Chester, charge." 

We fear that, if Chester so understood the use 
of the imperative mood, the battle was lost to 
Marmion. 

" Sometimes the subject [of the imperative mood] is 
in the first or the third person; as, Cursed be I that did 
so. Shak. Come we, who love the Lord. Watts. 
Thy kingdom come." 

It is no secret that all these verbs are in the 
subjunctive mood. This surely must have got 
under the head of Imperative Mood by mis- 
take. What the good old Doctor Watts really 
did say was " Come ye that love the lord." He 
used the imperative. The other is perfectly 
good English, corresponding to the Latin ven- 
iamus and the German kommen wir, but it is 
known to grammarians as the subjunctive. The 
imperative mood always has the second person 
for subject. 

" A few intransitive verbs are sometimes used in the 
passive form, though they are not in the passive voice; 
as, ' The melancholy days are come,' ' He it fallen,' 
(666, note)." 

On referring to the note, we learn that this is 
** a French idiom." If it be necessary to go 
outside of English to explain English grammar, 
why not call it a German idiom ? Ours is a 
Germanic, not a Romance, tongue, and it is the 
regular construction in German. But this 
happens to be an English idiom, coming down 
to us from Anglo-Saxon by direct lineal de- 
scent. In another part of his book the author 
informs us gravely that English grammar is 
now a grammar of modern English, and not 
Latin or Greek. It is largely controlled by the 
grammar of Anglo-Saxon," etc. This is very 
useful information, and it is true, but there is 
one English grammar that is evidently not 
" controlled " by Anglo-Saxon. If the author's 
knowledge of English had been under such 
control, we should not find, for one thing, in- 
cluded among Prefixes of Anglo-Saxon Origin : 
u En, em, in, im (to, into, to put into) ; as, 
engrave, enchant," Romance additions to the 
Anglo-Saxon stock.

Under " Miscellaneous Notes " there is dis- 
played throughout a good deal of originality. 
Only a few specimens can be given here : 
" Little. ' Little older '; adv. A little older '; noun." 
"Both. 'He is both rich and lucky'; adv. (966, 
note 2)." 

This note reads : 

" The correlatives both, either, and neither are adverbs 
of emphasis, modifying the two parts of the sentence 
joined by the conjunctions that follow." 

If the incredulous reader should demand more 
positive proof, he may find it on page 254 : 

"Adverbs of emphasis are used to render other words 
more emphatic. They may modify nouns, pronouns, 
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, verbals, phrases, clauses, or 
sentences. In I, too, am sick,' / is emphasized, and 
hence modified. In I am sick, too,' sick is made em- 
phatic. In ' I am too sick,' too is an adverb of degree. 
In ' Both winds and waves swept it,' both modifies winds 
and waves. Neither modifies just and kind in 'It was 
neither just nor kind.' Both and neither in such construc- 
tions are usually called conjunctions (966, note 2)." 

Of course, the dissenter may say : " What dif- 
ference does it make ? The average high school 
student does n't care a straw whether neither 
is an adverb or a conjunction, and whichever 
way he learns it he will straightway forget it." 
Teachers of English, however, inclined to op- 
timism, will insist that, if you are going to bother 
a pupil with such little things as parts of 
speech, it is best to aim at accuracy of instruc- 
tion always, whether you hit the mark or not. 

The author's treatment of " irregular verbs " 
is, to a man of feeling, simply horrible. Dare, 
an irregular verb, Deal, a verb of the weak 
conjugation, Dig, a verb of the strong conjuga- 
tion, are all dumped together in the same pile. 
To one trained in modern methods a return to 
such a work a,s this would be like an attempt, in 
the eyes of a scientist, to teach modern biology 
out of Goldsmith's " Animated Nature." 

Here is a pretty bit of romance that has the 
flavor of antiquity to recommend it, and is en- 
tirely in harmony with its environment : 

"Man, in Anglo-Saxon, was in the common gender; 
woman was ' wife-man ' or weft-man,' that is, the man 
that weaves." 

It is hard to kill a thing like that. Skeat's 
Etymological Dictionary hasn't been able to 
do it in eighteen years. It seems to be en- 
dowed with the gift of immortality, and we may 
expect to hear from it again in the next crop 
of high-school commencement essays. 

The study of English has made so rapid an 
advance in the last quarter of the century that 
this book was out of date the day it came from 
the press. It is half a century behind, and its 
effect upon English scholarship must needs be 



depressing. If justification be demanded for 
taking up so much space in reviewing a book 
of this kind, the plea must lie in the fact that 
the author is Principal of the First Normal 
School of the great State of Pennsylvania, and 
late President of the National Educational 
Association which met last summer at Los 
Angeles, the highest position in the gift of 
the teachers of the United States. It is to be 
feared, therefore, that official position may be 
expected to float this book, and there will be 
no lack of laudatory testimonials to fill its sails. 
There is one thing that may be said in praise 
of this book : it has steered clear of that fond 
device of grammaticasters, the diagram. For 
this the author has our sincere thanks.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



said nothing could be hazarded in affirming that 
far more had been spoken and printed, heard and 
read, on education in the country within the pre- 
ceding twelve years than ever before, were it all 
put together since the beginning of the colonies. 
What terms of comparison could Mr. Mann, if 
now living, find for the similar manifestations of 
educational interest ? The remark is prompted by 
the continuous stream of educational literature that 
flows from the press. No doubt some of this 
activity is primarily due to the action of a force 
that now furnishes a prominent educational theme, 
that is imitation, and so is significant only indirectly ; 
but much of it springs from a deep-seated original 
interest, and reveals to us the strong current that 
is now in motion. 

Professor James's hook, " Talks to Teachers on 
Psychology," is one of the very best of the new 
works on the subject The psychology that forms 
the basis of the " Talks " is but a small part of the 
psychology found in the author's great work bear- 
ing that title ; but there is enough to answer the 
present purpose, presented in beautifully clear and 
simple English, and well illustrated by examples 
drawn from the field of common observation. One 
can hardly help feeling, as he reads, that if psychol- 
ogy is not here shorn of its terrors for teachers, no 
other writer need hope to accomplish that task. 
One of the charms of the book is its uniform good 
sense. The writer has no respect for the pedagogical 
fashions and fads of the day because they are 
fashions and fads ; nor is he under any illusion as 
to the value of his special science to teachers, but 
has sound ideas as to what its value is, and how 
much there is of it. As an example of the way 
in which he deals with some of the favorite ideas 
of our popular educational guides, we quote from 
his remarks on the subject of emulation among 
pupils : 

14 To veto and taboo all possible rivalry of one youth 
with another, because such rivalry may degenerate into 
greedy and selfish excess, does seem to savor somewhat 
of sentimentality, or even of fanaticism. The feeling of 
rivalry lies at the very basis of our being, all social 
improvement being largely due to it. There is a noble 
and generous kind of rivalry, as well as a spiteful and 
greedy kind; and the noble and generous form is par- 
ticularly common in childhood. All games owe the 
zest which they bring with them to the fact that they 
are rooted in the emulous passion, yet they are the 
chief means of training in fairness and magnanimity. 
. . . The wise teacher will use this instinct as he uses 
others, reaping its advantages and appealing to it in 
such a way as to reap a maximum of benefit with a 
minimum of harm; for, after all, we must confess with 
a French critic of Rousseau's doctrine that the deepest 
spring of action in us is the sight of action in another. 
The spectacle of effort is what awakens and sustains 
our own efforts. No runner running all alone on a 
race track will find in his own will the power of stimu- 
lation which his rivalry with other runners incites, when 
he feels them at bis heels about to pass. When a 
trotting horse is 'speeded* a running horse must go 
beside him to keep him to the pace." 



Dr. Ladd's " Essays on the Higher Education," 
republished, deal with four important subjects : 
" The Development of the American University," 
"The Place of the Fitting School in American 
Education," " Education New and Old," and " A 
Modern Liberal Education." The views on these 
subjects of an able scholar, university professor, and 
student of education such as Dr. Ladd is, could 
not fail to be valuable. He finds the problem 
of the development of the University in this country 
to he largely the problem of securing a satis- 
factory secondary education. This done, he says it 
will be perfectly feasible to prepare the average 
American youth, at nineteen or twenty years of age, 
for beginning a true university education. He holds 
that if secondary education is properly reformed 
and duly elevated, the youth who has well accom- 
plished it will be better fitted to enter upon a 
university education than is at present the average 
youth at twenty-two who has just graduated from a 
first-class American college. This view of the case, 
which the facts certainly go a long ways toward 
sustaining, enlists the reader's interest in the paper 
on the Fitting School. The author's prescription 
consists in part of relegating most of the colleges 
and so-called universities to the secondary sphere. 
" Only those few institutions that have already 
acquired large resources of famous men and estab- 
lished courses and equipment for the highest 
instruction, and that can hope to draw from their 
own and from other colleges a sufficient constituency 
of pupils already trained in a thorough secondary 
education, should strive to develop themselves into 
universities." He ventures, therefore, " to assert 
that not more than half a dozen Universities should 
be developed in the entire country during the 
next generation, and that no new institutions to 
bear that name should, on any grounds whatever, 
be founded." This may be a sound view to take 
of the matter, but we do not exactly see how it will 
be made practicable. 

Mr. Boyer's outlook upon the " Principles and 
Methods of Teaching " is indicated by two facts. 
One is the statement in the preface that hia treatise 
is designed to be a stepping-stone to Rosenkranz's 
"Philosophy of Education " and Tompkin's " Phi- 
losophy of Teaching." The other is his definition 
of education, " The realization of man's possibili- 
ties, through systematic self-activity, for complete 
living." The book is divided into three parts : 
"Psychology," "Principles of Teaching," and 
" Methods of Teaching." It is as full of matter 
as it can hold, but we cannot help thinking that 
the author would have done teachers a better ser- 
vice if he had left out many of his topics and treated 
some others more fully. 

Professor Salmon's " Art of Teaching " opens 
with several general chapters on such topics as 
"Some General Principles," "Order, Attention, and 
Discipline," " Oral Questioning," and " Object Les- 
sons," and then passes to the branches of study 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

taught in elementary schools, treating them in a 
manner much more technical than is now the vogue 
in the United States in similar works. The book 
is marked by clearness of method and ai'rangement, 
perspicuity of language, and sound good sense. It 
is one of those useful volumes that, while they add 
nothing new to the knowledge or practice in teach- 
ing, do good service wherever they are read. 

In Froebel's "Education by Development," trans- 
lated by Miss Jarvis, and Miss Blow's " Letters to 
a Mother on the Philosophy of Froebel," we have 
valuable additions to the growing volume of Froe- 
belian literature. The world is slowly learning how 
much larger this great master was than the kinder- 
garten, with which his name was so long exclusively 
associated. 

Perhaps no school superintendent in the country 
has taken a deeper interest in the social phases of 
education than Mr. Samuel T. Dutton, formerly of 
New Haven, Conn., now of Brookline, Mass. His 
volume entitled " Social Phases of Education in the 
School and the Home " is a selection from the 
lectures and papers that he has devoted to these 
phases of the general subject in the course of the 
last few years. As he says in his preface, the point 
of view is in all cases social rather than scholastic, 
and the ideas emphasized are as worthy of con- 
sideration by parents as by teachers. One of the 
most suggestive titles is the last, " The Brookline 
Education Society and its Work." The more such 
societies as this are organized and carried on in the 
country the better. There are few educational 
problems more pressing at the present time than 
the proper correlation of the school and the home. 

Messrs. Dexter and Garlick's " Psychology in 
the School Room " we account one of the best books 
of its kind that we have seen. It is not at all the 
same kind of book as Professor James's "Talks," 
although both titles contain the same leading word. 
It is far more comprehensive and thorough. First, 
the authors give enough physiology to furnish a 
basis for the subject proper ; next, they state and 
illustrate the main facts of psychology with remark- 
able correctness and clearness ; and then they apply 
these facts with great good sense to the practical 
work of the teacher. We cannot exactly promise 
teachers that they will find the book easy reading, 
although we cannot really agree that it is hard 
reading; what is more, no book that deals thoroughly 
with the subject can be made wholly soft and easy. 

In his preface to Dr. Rector's volume of selec- 
tions from Montaigne's writings on the education 
of children, Dr. Harris, the editor of the series in 
which the volume appears, says, " The significance 
of Montaigne lies chiefly in his protest against 
pedantry," and this he defines to be the display of 
accumulated knowledge " that is not systematized 
itself nor applied to the solution of practical prob- 
lems." That is one way of putting the case, and 
perhaps the best way. The traditional way of 
putting it is that Montaigne was in full rebellion 



against the literary education set up by the Renais- 
sance, and in complete sympathy with an education 
that consisted primarily of realities. Mr. Oscar 
Browning assigns Montaigne to the class of edu- 
cationalists whom he calls "naturalists," "not only 
because they profess to follow nature," but " because 
they set before themselves as the chief good the 
development of the entire nature, and not merely 
the intellect or any part of it." Professor Laurie 
accounts Montaigne a realist, in the sense that he 
" desired to see reality, that is, to see the substance 
of fact and thought dominant in the education of 
youth." The Professor says further : " Montaigne's 
realism opposed itself merely to verbalism, and he 
fought a good fight in this " ; that is, he was not a 
natural-realist, claiming to find educational material 
solely in nature and real life, but a real-humanist, 
finding reality or substance in nature, in the human 
spirit, or in the records of past thought and feeling. 
Perhaps Dr. Harris's statement does not differ 
materially in substance from Professor Laurie's, 
but it is certainly put more sharply, and, formally 
speaking, more strikingly. It is well calculated to 
stick in the memory : Montaigne the protestor 
against pedantry is quite as striking as Montaigne 
the skeptic or Montaigne the rationalist. The 
question of classification aside, no one disputes 
or doubts that Montaigne holds a very important 
place in the succession of educational reformers. 
The significance of Dr. Rector's book lies in the 
fact that it brings the things Montaigne wrote about 
education together, presents them to the reader 
in small compass apart from the matter in which 
it is embedded in the original works, and accom- 
panies them with suitable preface, introduction, 
notes, and indexes. The service that he renders 
the student, and still more the mere reader, is an 
important one ; for it must be remembered that, in 
great part, what Montaigne had to say on this sub- 
ject he scattered here and there through his some- 
what voluminous writings. Mr. Rector has much 
to say of his author's " modernity," and with good 
reason. He presents a full page, embracing twenty- 
one items, of " modern educational ideas anticipated 
by Montaigne," and fortifies his generalizations with 
appropriate references. He has placed pedagogists, 
teachers, and readers of educational books under 
decided obligations to him. 

Mr. P. A. Barnett's book on " Common Sense in 
Education and Teaching " is happily named as well 
as written. Educational practice, and educational 
thought and writing in less degree, oscillate between 
the two poles of crass empiricism and stark dogma- 
tism. At the one extreme stand those who deny 
in theory, if not in practice, that there are such 
things as controlling ideas or governing principles 
in teaching ; at the other, those who say, or think, 
that teaching is nothing more than the reading off 
of a formula. It is hard to say which one is nearer 
the truth, if the expression may be allowed, but we 
incline to the empiricist rather than the dogmatician. 
Therefore every book that points with reasonable 



278 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



steadiness to the degree in the arc marked " com- 
mon sense " is heartily to be welcomed ; and much 
more than this can be claimed for Mr. Barnett's 
work. 

He has no more patience with fads and faddists 
than has Professor James. He explodes in his first 
chapter " the complete sentence method," as pat by 
the dogmatician, and even defends in secondary 
schools marks and "taking place" under proper 
conditions. His remarks on questions and question- 
ing are excellent. 

' After all, it should be remembered that in tbe com- 
mon order of things it is tbe person needing instruction 
who usually asks questions, not the person giving it Why 
should tbe nature of things be topsy-turvy in the school- 
room ? It is not so at home. Why should the ques- 
tioner in school be almost always tbe teacher instead of 
the learner? Our business is to make our scholars feel 
the lack of information, desire to ask questions; to 
encourage them to find out what they can for them- 
selves, and to be keen to hear what we have to add to 
their stock. They must, in fact, question us, or at all 
events stand in the attitude of those who want to know." 
Seven of the eight chapters of Professor Hanus'g 
"Educational Aims and Educational Values " were 
written as contributions to educational reviews. 
They are, however, well worthy of being put in this 
more accessible and permanent form. Like other 
books made up in the same way, this one cannot 
claim an absolute centre of unity, and shows more 
or less centrifugal tendency ; but the first five chap- 
ters conform to a general plan that is well expressed 
in the title of the book. Professor Hanus is always 
clear and pointed, leaving no one uncertain as to 
his meaning, or causing him to waste time in finding 
it out. He is never esoteric, transcendental, or " pro- 
found " in the sense that neither he nor anyone else 
knows exactly what he means. He writes clearly 
and strongly because he thinks clearly and strongly. 
Nobody, for example, can mistake the meaning of 
such a paragraph as this : 

* It is evident that any estimate of educational values 
must ultimately depend on educational aims. The 
studies chosen are the means (not the sole means, of 
course, but the most important means) for the realiza- 
tion of those aims. The conception of the end to be 
attained must therefore determine the value of the 
means proposed; and any consideration of educational 
value must accordingly include a consideration of edu- 
cational aims." 

The author is thoroughly modern in his general 
view of education, in the good sense of that term. 
He holds with Mr. Spencer, that the aim of educa- 
tion is to prepare for complete living. Again, he 
sees clearly that every national culture, and particu- 
larly every great national culture, must be rooted 
and grounded in the mother tongue. To quote three 
or four sentences on this point : 

" This is the instrument of all the pupil's acquisitions 
and of common intercourse with bis fellows. Moreover, 
it is tbe embodiment of rich stores of information and 
of the highest ideals of the race. If instruction in the 
mother tongue is not limited merely to the study of its 
form and structure, but really serves, as it should, as 



tbe means of exploring and interpreting both the world 
of external nature and the world of man, the mother 
tongue will be richer in incentives and possess higher 
incentives than all otber forms of knowledge, and it 
may therefore have a higher educational value than all 
other subjects." 

We should say, rather, it must have such higher 
educational value. The last chapter deals dis- 
criminatingly, if briefly,with the permanent influence 
of Comenius. The one chapter that now sees 
the light for the first time relates to what Professor 
Hanus and his associates are trying to do for the 
study of education at Harvard University. 

Among the best judges, there will be no dissent 
from the statement that the value of child study to 
the parent or teacher is practical rather than scien- 
tific, and that it is reflex in character ; or, to be 
more definite, that it consists in mental habit rather 
than the possession of any specific facts or knowl- 
edge. This mental habit, of course, is an interest 
in and sympathy with the child that leads to intel- 
ligent observation of his mind, character, and life, 
and thus to a course of wise direction in consonance 
therewith. Mr. Rowe's book on "The Physical 
Nature of the Child " is written in harmony with 
this view ; that is, the teacher should pursue child 
study primarily for practical ends, and not for the 
sake of advancing scientific knowledge of children. 
The book is one that may be well recommended to 
teachers. 

Certainly those who have read appreciatively 
that excellent book, " Educational Reformers," will 
wish to know something more about its author, his 
life, character, and work. This " something more " 
they will find in the " Life and Remains of the Rev. 
R. H. Quick." The book consists of a memoir, 125 
pages, and extracts from Mr. Quick's note-books, 
420 pages more. In his preface Mr. Storr, the editor, 
says there are forty of these note-books, which, if 
printed in extento, would make ten or eleven vol- 
umes equal in size to the present one. They con- 
stitute a life-record extending over more than a 
quarter of a century. The interest of the memoir 
is touched with a tender pathos, for Mr. Quick was 
of a reflective rather than practical turn of mind, 
and failed, externally speaking, to achieve the suc- 
cess in life that his mental abilities and personal 
qualities seemed to justify. Then there is the 
pathetic story of his death. What the editor left 
behind him unused, we do not know ; but he has 
not printed a page that was not worth printing, 
most of them well worth printing. Open the book 
-here you will, you are interested at once in what 
you see. It abounds in quotable passages, in fact 
is mainly made up of such passages. Mr. Quick 
was a clergyman and a deeply religious man, facts 
which add importance to what he says of the re- 
ligious teaching in the National schools and Sunday 
schools of England. The trouble here, as he depicts 
it, is the same as the trouble elsewhere : want of 
real interest in the lesson, and consequent filling of 
the mind with words. He declares that " Sunday 



1899.]

school teaching seems for the most part to be a 
wind-bag." And again : " The truth is the religious 
teaching given to our young people is not good 
enough to interest them, so their minds do not take 
it in, and they remember at best words only." The 
state of things that he describes is not peculiar to 
England. As a rule, Sunday schools are the worst 
taught of all American schools ; and that is saying 
a great deal. B> A< HINSDALE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

A disappointing Professor Saintsbury's book on 
exposition of " Matthew Arnold " (Dodd, Mead 

Matthew Arnold. & CQ ) j g) Qn the who]e) a disap _ 

pointment. In his preface, after quoting Arnold's 
complaint that Macaulay, in his Essay on Milton, 
had given us not the real truth about Milton but 
merely a panegyric on Milton and the Puritans, 
Mr. Saintsbury goes on to say that he has endeav- 
ored to " help the reader who wants criticism." 
Even from this point of view the book is regretably 
deficient. We find here no picture of the man 
Arnold, poet, educational leader, essayist, religious 
reformer ; no attempt to expound his message to 
the world or his attitude toward life ; no setting 
forth of what the world was to him or he to the 
world, as Carlyle would have ; little beyond a few 
facts, drawn properly enough from the " Letters," 
and Mr. George Saintsbury's opinions about his 
writings ; and since Mr. Saintsbury is merely " an 
analyst of the form of art for its own sake," these 
will hardly do for Matthew Arnold. In fact, Mr. 
Saintsbury's attitude toward his subject makes us 
fear that he does not himself understand fully what 
Matthew Arnold tried to do. The decade, for ex- 
ample, from 1867 to 1877, which produced " Cul- 
ture and Anarchy," " St. Paul and Protestantism," 
" Literature and Dogma," " God and the Bible," 
and " Last Essays," is characterized by the head- 
ing "In the Wilderness." Mr. Saintsbury regrets 
this period of Arnold's life ; would have had him 
write more poems, and "infinite essays." We agree 
with the biographer that this is an idle wish, by 
suppressing which some space might have been 
saved ; but we cannot agree with him as to this 
estimate of the religious reform era of Arnold's 
life. Granted that Arnold was often misunderstood, 
often produced an effect quite unlike that intended ; 
was his work in those years therefore a failure? 
History assures us that scores of prophets have had 
to wait long before their words began to win 
comprehension ; the most notable instance of all, 
probably, coming from Nazareth. Even if some of 
Arnold's arguments in " Literature and Dogma," 
were wide of the mark though we think Mr. 
Saintsbury has not quite succeeded in overthrowing 
them, still, our biographer admits that no one 
" smashed " the book, as Dean Mansel if alive or 
Cardinal Newman if then in the fold " could have 



done "; and its influence may be judged by the fact 
that a few years ago it was voted by the readers of 
an English democratic newspaper to be Arnold's 
most valued book. Every student of Arnold's life 
knows that the really serious work of his later 
years was not the composition of pure literature, 
but was rather an attempt to change some sadly 
mistaken ideals of the English people ; as one writer 
puts it, to transform, without destroying, their re- 
ligion. Now, Mr. Saintsbury, with his merely 
literary tastes, apparently does not understand, or if 
he does understand he gives a very inadequate ac- 
count of, the conditions which Arnold set himself 
to improve. It is certain that he has by no means 
said the last word concerning this part of Arnold's 
life. The criticisms on Arnold's poetry, however, 
are sane, and if we set aside some obscurities of 
style and some violations of elegance, are fairly 
well done. 



The Dutch 
and others 
in Africa. 



Sir Harry H. Johnston's " Coloniza- 
tion of Africa " (Macmillan) is an 
attempt " to summarize and review 
in a single book the general history of the attempts 
of Asia and Europe to colonize Africa during the 
historical period." The volume is true to the au- 
thor's promise, crammed with facts and encyclopae- 
dic in character ; in spite of which we have an 
altogether readable book bearing evidence of ex- 
treme care and careful research. Of special inter- 
est at the present time is the chapter on " The 
Dutch in Africa." Although this chapter was writ- 
ten before it became evident that Mr. Chamberlain 
stood back of the Uitlanders of Johannesburg in 
their demand for greater concessions and a larger 
degree of political influence in the Transvaal, the 
general question of England's relation to the Dutch 
in South Africa is carefully examined. Treated 
historically, it serves to show that the present crisis 
is but the culmination of two centuries of differ- 
ences between peoples of widely separated degrees 
of civilization. Mr. Johnston argues that the chief 
difficulty has always been the failure of a nineteenth- 
century administrative to understand a seventeenth- 
century subject population, for such he considers 
the Dutch of South Africa. The British govern- 
ment is credited with having failed from the begin- 
ning to take proper measures for the maintenance 
and spread of English influence. Reforms have 
been too suddenly and too harshly executed, as in 
the case of the abolition of slavery in Cape Colony ; 
or, on the other hand, the proverbial stubbornness 
of the Boers has too easily frightened English min- 
isters from projects of sound policy. Incidentally, 
the author makes the curious assertion that if Scotch 
administrators had been sent to Cape Colony early 
in the present century, few of the later troubles 
would have followed. This opinion is based upon 
the fact that the Scotch and the Dutch are similar 
in character, temperament, and religion ; though 
why the Scotch more than the English should have 
sympathized with the patriarchal form of slave-

THE DIAL

holding desired by the Dutch, is not made clear. 
The attitude of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, in indirectly 
urging the movement which resulted in the deplor- 
able Jameson raid, is criticised. In reference to 
this point, the author maintains that an amicable 
settlement of the grievances of the Johannesburgers 
would have been accomplished ultimately through 
pressure from the Cape Colony Dutch upon those 
of the Transvaal. Britain's difficulties now are 
directly traceable to her shilly-shally policy toward 
the Dutch in the early part of the century, and to 
the essentially different aspect in which life, its 
duties and its privileges, presents itself to the Dutch 
and to the English mind. Other chapters treat of 
each important colonizing nation in turn, and all 
are instructive and entertaining. The book con- 
tains some unusually good maps, showing Africa by 
religions, by areas of slave trade, by colonizability, 
and by political divisions at different periods. 

"The Authority of Criticism and 
Other Essays " (Scribner) is the title 
of a new volume by Professor W. P. 
Trent. The essays are nine in number, concerned 
with literary themes, and happily combining discus- 
sions of theory with practical applications of the 
critical principles to which the author adheres. The 
titular essay offers one of the strongest pleas ever 
made for criticism of the academic and authorita- 
tive sort. Mr. Trent's opinion of the other sort of 
criticism may be inferred from his prefatory refer- 
ence to the critics who " continue their uncomfort- 
able and undignified floundering in the bogs of dog- 
matism and impressionism." Here we are in hearty 
agreement with the author; elsewhere, as in the 
essay on Shelley, we are compelled to disagree with 
him, although with respect. To defend Matthew 
Arnold's perverse opinion of Shelley is, to our 
mind, as hopeless a task as could well be attempted ; 
yet this is substantially what Mr. Trent undertakes 
to do. Nor is his attempt to make us accept Arnold's 
exaggerated estimate of Byron much less hopeless. 
The palpable honesty of his dealings with these two 
vexed themes enlists our sympathies, but his argu- 
ments fail to convince. A more doubtful problem 
is raised by the essay on " Tennyson and Musset 
Once More." Here there is no definite pronounce- 
ment, but rather a plea for fairness. We have re- 
cently discussed this subject editorially, and agree 
with Mr. Trent in thinking that English criticism 
has taken the relative inferiority of French poetry 
far too much for granted. Among the remaining 
essays of this collection, those entitled " Literature 
and Morals," "The Nature of Literature," and 
"Teaching the Spirit of Literature " are the most 
important, and display what seems to us unexcep- 
tionable soundness of judgment. We read the last- 
named of these three, and pray that the ideas to 
which it gives expression may sometime find their 
way into the English departments of our schools 
and colleges. We hope that Mr. Trent's volume 
will reach many readers; for it surely deserves

them. The studies are so fine, both in their liter- 
ary form and literary feeling, that no one could fail 
to profit by their perusal or could help being stim- 
ulated by them, even when dissenting most vigor- 
ously from their conclusions. They were well worth 
bringing together from the periodicals in which they 
first saw the light. 

Paris itself is not more Parisian than 
its greatest actress appears to be in 
M. Jules Huret's "Sarah Bern- 
hardt" (Lippincott). Mine. Sarah fell ill a year 
ago, and had to submit to the surgeon's knife. In 
convalescence she amused herself by telling M. 
Huret the story of her life with some omissions, 
but still with great candor. Her age will be sought 
in vain in this biography, and many other things 
which have to do with her private life. But her 
professional career is spread before the reader 
like a panorama, and it discloses in every one of its 
many pictures a very great dramatic artist, an artist 
whose memory is a lasting delight to all who have 
seen her. Of her endeavors in the sister arts of 
painting and sculpture, there is too little said here, 
and that rather beside the purpose. It is curious 
to observe, in the later parts of the book, Mme. 
Bernhardt's desire to be taken as a missionary in 
behalf of the French tongue, rather than as an ex- 
ponent of an art so universal as to comprise the 
modern world in its appeal. This last estimate be- 
ing true, it seems needless to criticize the taste of 
the work. M. Edmond Rostand, who writes a brief 
preface for his friend, M. Huret, says the account 
made him dizzy. It is likely that any attempt to 
follow Mme. Bernhardt's indefatigable personality 
will have the same effect ; but M. Rostand's insist- 
ence that it is the workwoman in Mine. Bernhardt 
who appeals to him rather than the vagarious creature 
outside, reveals the fact. The translation into En- 
glish is by M. G. A. Raper, and is clear and idiomatic. 
The illustrations, from photographs of the actress's 
many roles, are numerous and valuable.

of the Queen. & Co ^ Mr Charles Wyndham mir- 
rors the daily life of the real Tommy Atkins, 
that is to say, of the private soldier in the British 
Infantry, in the piping times of peace. The book 
is a transcript, evidently a faithful one, of the au- 
thor's own experiences. Mr. Wyndham was what 
is known as a " gentleman ranker " a man of good 
birth, breeding, and education, who for personal 
reasons courts the blandishments of the recruiting- 
officer, and takes the Queen's shilling. It was in 
October, 1890, that Mr. Wyndham decided to take 
the plunge ; and he presently found himself duly 
enrolled under the comprehensive and conveniently 
vague patronymic of Robinson," and undergoing 
the final test in the ceremonial of enlistment, t. c.,

and infectious-looking Bible, on which he feigned

(with his gentleman-ranker squeamishness) to im- 
print a fervent salute. " Some of the men, how- 
ever, made up for this little discrepancy on my part 
by kissing their Bibles with gusto, invoking at the 
same time strange deities in aid of their due ob- 
servance of their vows. My immediate neighbor, 
for instance, audibly exclaimed ' S'elp me Gawd ! 
May I be struck pink if I goes back on it ! " ' Thus 
began Mr. Wyndham's seven years of service, at 
home, and in Ireland, Gibraltar, Malta, South Af- 
rica, etc., during which time he rose to be a ser- 
geant, closing his service by purchasing his discharge. 
Mr. Wyndham has taken pains to describe tersely 
and literally the common soldier's prosaic routine 
of life, which he does with a saving vein of humor, 
and with a keen eye to the peculiarities of " Tommy 
Atkins " whose besetting sin is clearly a fondness 
for the Canteen that must inevitably impair his 
character as a man and his efficiency as a soldier. 
On the whole, however, the author's account of 
army life is rather favorable strikingly so, if we 
compare his book with M. Decle's recent extremely 
bitter book on the French Army, which may be 
profitably compared with the present volume. Of 
these two works, Mr. Wyndham's is decidedly the 
more impersonal and purely descriptive, and there- 
fore the more likely to inspire faith in its trust- 
worthiness. There are several photographic plates 
representing types of the British soldier. 

This unique many-colored Bible 
We (Ddd, Mead & Co.) is increasing 

in size. Its latest additions are 
" Joshua," by W. H. Bennett of London, and " Eze- 
kiel," by C. H. Toy, of Harvard University. " The 
Book of Joshua " is the most polychrome specimen 
we have seen. Its clear text is printed on eight 
different colored backgrounds, while there are five 
such backgrounds for its italics. These documents, 
together with one additional one indicated by sym- 
bols, make up a total of fourteen sources of the book 
of Joshua. Mr. Bennett, with a marvellous inge- 
nuity, and we might almost say audacity, pictures to 
his readers just how these documents were joined 
and pieced together. The archaeological and topog- 
raphical notes are valuable in that they are fresh 
and up-to-date. The volume on Ezekiel is not, 
beyond the title-page, in any sense polychrome. 
Professor Toy's wisdom is expended on the trans- 
lation and notes. By careful textual work he has 
made notable improvements in the rendering of this 
difficult book. The notes, too, indicate wide read- 
ing, and discrimination in the use of matter. The 
use of illustrations in these books deserves the same 
criticism as that given on former volumes. They are 
abundant, some excellent, some good, some fair, some 
poor. Many are appropriate, some are only remotely 
related to the subject, and some even represent what 
is not the case. There is an overplus of illustrations 
from the monuments, whose bearing on the text is 
barely tangential. The volume on Joshua is admir- 
able, one of the best specimens of the results of the 



subjective literary analysis of the Old Testament ; 
while that on Ezekiel is an exhibition of first-class 
scholarship applied to one of the difficult and most- 
neglected books of the Old Testament. 

M<ix Muller Professor Max Mtiller's second vol- 

and hiii friends ume of reminiscences of " Auld Lang 
from India. g yne ( Scribner ) treats of his In- 

dian friends. The book, while not so chatty and 
amusing as its lively predecessor, contains never- 
theless more solid meat of information and matter 
of actual newness. Gossip about contemporary 
English men of letters, and of social and political 
celebrities, such as the earlier volume contains, we 
get nowadays in many forms and from many hands ; 
but it is not by any means every man whose ex- 
periences qualify him to write as interestingly and 
instructively of India and the Indians as can the 
learned editor of the Veda the "Pundit of the 
Far West," as one of his Hindu friends styles him. 
It is needless, perhaps, to say that Professor Muller 
has never journeyed, save in imagination, to India. 
Such Indians as he has known have been travellers 
from Hindustan who have sought him out in England, 
or natives with whom he has corresponded. His 
name is naturally a familiar one to Indian scholars. 
The volume is divided into five chapters, the best 
one of which, and the one for which the average 
reader will be most truly thankful, being that which 
treats of the Veda for, says Professor Muller, 
" Was not the Veda the first of my Indian friends ? 
Was it not the bridge that led me from West to 
East, from Greece and Italy to India, nay, from 
Dessau to Oxford, from Germany to England?" 
This chapter, besides describing and explaining the 
general character of this oldest of books, contains 
eight translations of Vedic hymns, rendered as 
nearly as possible in the metre of the original. The 
book is written in the author's usual pleasant style, 
and its theme lies in a special sense within his 

province. 

Letters from "The Etchingham Letters," which 

an English have been appearing serially in the 

family circle. Cornell " magazine, and which 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have just published in 
book form, are the joint work of Sir Frederick 
Pollock and Mrs. Fuller Maitland, who, in the re- 
spective characters of Sir Richard Etchingham and 
his sister, carry on a familiar correspondence with 
each other. These letters have no story to tell, or 
at best the merest thread of a story ; but as we read 
them we find ourselves becoming intimately ac- 
quainted with members of the Etchingham family 
circle, and the letters come to have an interest for 
us that is almost personal. The announcements of 
this book speak of its " literary flavor," but the sug- 
gestion is misleading. Although written for publi- 
cation, they show hardly a trace of pose, and it is 
difficult to realize that they are not the actual cor- 
respondence of the members of a cultivated English 
family. They are rarely even bookish, and are 
more likely to tell about the doings of the domestic

cat than about the intellectual preoccupations of

not easy to define. It lies in their unaffacted sim-

give us of the intimate daily life of the brother and

grouped in the form of historical sketches. Mr. 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, " In Old Cam- 
bridge" (Macmillan), has added to the rapidly 
increasing number of his reminiscences, however, 
a somewhat careful volume upon those of his friends 
who have done so much to make Cambridge the 
source of scholarly and literary influence through- 
out our country. In a general way, we have been 
ready to render the honor due to this town ; but 
after one has read this book, no matter how strong 
has been his devotion to the literary Mecca of New 
England, he will be convinced that its importance 
has been underestimated. In a certain way, it may 
be that the group of remarkable men which Mr. 
Higginson describes have become as remote as other 
classics ; but for this very reason we can be grate- 
ful to the author for recalling so distinctly the sev- 
eral personalities in connection with the town to 
which they were so uniformly loyal. Perhaps aa 
interesting as anything in the volume is the account 
of the early days of " The Atlantic," and the anal- 
ysis of its contents into material that did or did not 
originate in Cambridge. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

M. Gas ton Boissier has added another volume to bis 
already somewhat numerous books upon popular archae- 
ology, and in " Roman Africa " (Putnam) has described 
the important but little-known region of Northern 
Africa. The volume contains an interesting chapter 
upon Carthage, and another upon African literature, 
the latter being calculated to surprise the easy-going 
reader who has generously handed over all Africa, 
ancient and modern, to the negroes. ID fact, the entire 
volume is filled with information which hitherto has 
been almost the entire property of the special student 
in Roman history. The volume contains four maps, 
and a special study of the city of Timejad, the name of 
which is probably as unknown to the average student 
of literature as the city itself. M. Boissier has here 
rendered the reading public a distinct service, and it is 
none the less because he has made the matter interesting 
reading. 

"A History of Literary Criticism in the Renaissance," 
by Mr. Joel Elias Spingaru, is a doctor's dissertation 
presented to Columbia University, and is published in 
a substantial volume by the Macmillan Co. Both in 
bulk and in solidity of workmanship it is far beyond 
what we usually expect such dissertations to be, and 
covers its ground with such thoroughness that it will 
not soon be superseded. The criticism of Italy, France, 



and England, is discussed, with the conclusion that the 
critical system first elaborated in Italy " ultimately 
triumphed " in France, so that " modern classicism rep- 
resents the supremacy of the French phase, or version, 
of Renaissance Aristotelianism." Students of literary 
theory in its historical aspect will find this work an 
indispensable part of their apparatus. 

Dr. Mary Augusta Scott's classified bibiography of 
" Elizabethan Translations from the Italian," published 
by the Modern Language Association of America, has 
now reached its fourth part, which we understand com- 
pletes the work, although the author promises in a 
further paper " to bring together the Elizabethan dra- 
mas that are Italian in source, or scene, or direct sug- 
gestion." The present work, as now completed in its 
four sections, describes 411 translations, made by 219 
Englishmen from 223 Italian authors, and provides 
substantial evidence of the author's thesis to the effect 
that no other " foreign vogue, before or since, ever took 
such hold upon English society." 

A volume of Elementary Studies in Chemistry," 
by Mr. Joseph Torrey, Jr., is published by the Messrs. 
Holt. It is a text-book of inorganic chemistry upon a 
new plan, combining lectures and demonstrations with 
laboratory work in a manner that commends itself 
strongly to our approval. We quote a few timely sen- 
tences from the preface: "Chemistry has suffered 
from the irrepressible wave of laboratory madness 
which has swept over the whole educational world. . . . 
Nothing too severe can be said against the mechanical 
and demoralizing system of note-books with < opera- 
tion,' ' observation,' and ' inference ' headings. They 
are wholesale breeders of dishonest and superficial 
work." It was time for some one to say these things, 
and we commend the book most heartily. The essen- 
tial aim of the author is to restore the disciplinary 
value of the study, and his method is well worthy of 
attention. 

The "Second Year Latin" book (Ginu) of Professors 
Greenough, D'Ooge, and Dauiell, consists of two parts, 
the first containing nearly a hundred pages of easy prose, 
the second something like four books of Caesar. About 
four hundred pages of notes and vocabulary supplement 
the text, making a thick volume altogether. The same 
publishers send us an edition of the " Hippolytos " of 
Euripides, edited by Mr. J. E. Harry. "A First Greek 
Book" (Harper) is the work of Dr. L. L. Forman. 
The " Essentials of Latin " (Eldredge) comes to us from 
Dr. Benjamin \\ . Mitchell. " Longmans' Illustrated 
First Latin Reading- Book and Grammar," by Mr. H. 
R. Heatley, is a very elementary work indeed. From 
the Oxford Clarendon Press we have a two-page fac- 
simile (with reprint) of " Juvenali's ad Satiram Sextam 
in Codice Bodl. Canon. XLI. Additi Versus XXXVI.," 
transcribed by Mr. E. O. Winstedt. 

Miss Hannah Lynch's " Toledo, the Story of an Old 
Spanish Capital" (Macmillan) is one of the admirable 
series treating of " Mediaeval Towns " in their various 
aspects, and its particular subject is of more than ordin- 
ary interest, even where all is interesting. Toledo has 
been a city of kings from before the days when no less 
a person than Hannibal did its inhabitants the honor of 
defeating them. It possessed a spirit so indomitable 
that neither Roman nor Saracen could reduce it to de- 
pendence, so Miss Lynch tells us. But to-day it is in 
the midst of restorations and other acts of vandalism 
which bid fair to destroy the best of the little left of 
its wonderful inheritance from the ages.

We are glad to note that Mr. Fred M. Fling's 
"Studies in European History" (Lincoln: Miller) has 
passed into a second edition. It is a very helpful ad- 
junct to the work of teachers, and deserves the widest 
possible use. 

We have just received seven new volumes in the

EZEKIEL'S SIN. A Cornish Romance. 

By H. H. PEARCE, 

Author of " Eli's Daughter," " Inconsequent Lives," etc. 
New illustrated edition, small 8vo, $1.25. 

"Ezekiel Traveskis was an honest man, tempted beyond 
his strength through his love for his daughter. The story of 
his struggle with his conscience and his remorse is most touch- 
ingly and pathetically described." 

" Mr. Pearce has done for the Cornish coast what Hamlin 
Garland has done for the West, Thomas Nelson Page for the 
South, and Miss Wilkins for New England. He deserves to 
be read by all Americans as well as the English-speaking 
people in the four corners of the earth." The Times-Union. 

"A strong story. The scenery is new, as the story is a 
Cornish romance. The writer tells of humble folk, seafaring 
people, as rough as their coast ; but the tale is a powerful one. 
The book should go beside Hall Caine's tragedies of fisher- 
folk." Buffalo Express. 

" There is excellent and most sympathetic writing in every 
chapter." The Bookman. 

"'Ezekiel's Sin' is the best novel this year." Musical 
Courier. 

What the English critics say of EZEKIEL'S SIN. 

" Cornwall is fortunate in having an interpreter of its life 
so capable of understanding its spirit and of rendering some- 
thing of its rugged external beauty. He has a high ideal of 
form and expression, and the book is full of delightful 
pictures of the sea, the lonely life of the fishermen, and the 
sparse dwellers of the coast." The Sketch. 

" Mr. Pearce can portray character with remarkable clear- 
ness and power, and he has the fortunate gift of being able 
to bring home intimately to his readers the sights and sounds 
of nature. The atmosphere of the stormy Cornish coast suf- 
fuses the whole of this book." The Scotsman.

This table is furnished in either oak or walnut, as

simple ingenuity of arrangement, and thoroughness of 
workmanship. The machine-bead is hinged, so that it 
can be folded down below the table against a bent-wood 
shield that fully protects the dress of the operator and 
the floor from all droppings of oil, lint, etc. By this 
device the machine is thoroughly protected from dust, 
and the stand forms an ornamental and useful table 
that is fitting and appropriate to any home. The hinged 
extension-leaf covering the machine when down is folded 
back when it is raised, thus making a table-top measur- 
ing 40 inches in length by 16 in width, affording ample 
room for the work.

It gives in as simple a 
manner as possible the " elements " of French. The 
process of selection has been carried on with extreme 
care in order to eliminate only those things not essen- 
tial, and at the same time to avoid complexity of 
details and dryness of technicality, while giving all the 
technicality necessary to understand the mechanism of 
the language.

Account of the Dreyfus Trial 

THE 

TRAGEDY OF DREYFUS 

By Q. W. STEEVENS 

(Author of "With Kitchener to Khartum ") 



STRONG AND DRAMATIC 

Mr. Steevens . . . will not easily be 
surpassed in the dramatic vigor and the 
directness of the impressions which he 
conveys. He puts the case strongly, and 
the more so because he is manifestly 
anxious to take no side, presenting the 
Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards with 
equal impartiality. London Times. 



GRAPHIC AS FICTION 

The gifts of Mr. Steevens are vari- 
ous, but the attribute which gives his 
work its distinction is its picturesque- 
ness. . . . His descriptions of real 
events are as graphic as the description 
of imaginary events in the works of 
the best writers of fiction. Literature 
(London). 



CLEAR, CONCISE, AND TRENCHANT 

Mr. Steevens's strength has always lain in concise and trenchant description, 
a quality which he exhibits in the very highest degree upon the present occasion. 
Full of humor and observation, his sketches of the actors in the great drama 
itself cannot fail to be interesting ... all these figures spring to life before us 
beneath the virile pen of Mr. Steevens. London Daily Telegraph.

MESSRS. BADGER'S NEW FICTION 



" A vigorous book by a man with stuff In Mm" PALL MALL GAZETTE. 

THE HOUSE OF THE SORCERER 

A Novel. By HALDANE McFALL. With frontispiece. 12mo, $1.25. 

The scene of this remarkable and somewhat startling novel is laid in the West Indies, where the author 
was for many years an officer in a Zouave regiment. It is the most powerfully realistic representation of 
negro life ever written, and must certainly become one of the most widely discussed volumes of the year. 

AN AMERICAN OPINION. 

The Commercial Advertiser (New York): "Mr. McFall has drawn a tense, pitiless picture of the supersti- 
tion, sensuality, and general abasement of a type which in lacking ' sex-honor,' lacks, he thinks, the keystone 
of civilization. There is much in this book which is not agreeable reading; yet there is an undeniable fascin- 
ation in his portrayal of the intense, pulsating, animal life of the tropics; while the remarkable incantation 
scene in the tenth chapter, where ' the Widow Tiffles becomes possessed of a devil,' in the manner of treat- 
ment forcibly suggests the much-praised pilgrimage scene in D'Annunzio's Triondo della Morte. There is no 
question that the book is bound to attract attention as something unique in contemporary fiction." 

SOME ENGLISH OPINIONS. 

The London Times : " Paints the nigger to the life." | The Saturday Review : " An extraordinary story." 

The Daily News : " A vital study, wrought with swift strong strokes." 

The Bookman : " From the first paragraph this novel must arrest the attention of such as care for good 
writing in their fiction, and are sensible to power and truth in the description of the external world. It is alto- 
gether an exceptional book. 

SOME MORE GOOD FICTION.

College Stories. By GRACE MARGARET GALLAHER. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 
The publishers believe this to be the first attempt to depict with any degree of fidelity the student life in 
any particular girls' college, and the author has been very happy in her selection of subjects and in her treat- 
ment of them. Miss Gallaher will be remembered as the winner of the prize for short stories in the Century 
Magazine's recent competition. The book is illustrated by some fifteen illustrations of interesting and unhack- 
neyed views of the college and its surroundings. With a frontispiece in color.

A story curiously in harmony with the speculative 
inquiry of the day regarding the nature of life after 
death. Its scenery and events are those of which " eye 
hath not seen," yet the reader intuitively feels the real- 
ity of the narrative. Its evident truth appeals alike to 
his reason and his intuition. The conversation between 
the man who wakens to find that he has passed into the 
new life and his friend who meets him is full of simple 
information. The style is very winning, and the book 
is one to create as well as to meet a wide demand.

THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES were issued to meet what in the opinion of the Editor and the Pub- 
lishers, was a direct need in American literature, a series of brief, well-written, readable, and 
authoritative biographies of eminent Americans, to include, in the end, all whose lives were notably dis- 
tinctive or typical. 

In respect of manufacture, the Publishers have attempted to make a set of " little books " which should 
worthily compete, in all points of style and workmanlike thoroughness, with any of the well-known series 
which are made in England. Each volume measures 3 : j z 5.] inches, and is thus of a size to go handily 
into the pocket. The cover (in blind and gold on limp blue cloth) is by Mr. Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, 
who has done also the standing title-page for the series, which has been engraved on copper. The frontis- 
piece portrait which accompanies each is in photogravure. The paper has been selected with great care, 
and the type used is a new face specially cut. 

The notices of the Beacon Biographies in the reviews have been complimentary to a high degree. Thus 
the Boston Herald says: "There is neither romanticism nor realism in the treatment; the effort is always 
toward the sanest, fairest, soundest reality." "As carefully prepared," says the New York Times, "as if they 
were so many imperial quartos." " The form of these little volumes," according to the Nation, " and the 
general tastefulness of the get-up are delectable." " They do more than languidly interest," says the 
Outlook, "they interest vividly; and their instruction is surprisingly comprehensive." The Churchman ex- 
tends " a hearty welcome to this useful little series, which should bring many who shrink from attempting 
long volumes to a better knowledge of the men who have impressed their personality on the history of their 
country or the character of their countrymen." And the Review of Reviews says: " The five volumes thus 
far issued wholly justify all the promises made by the publishers."

PARSON KELLY: An Historical Story. 

By A. E. W. MASON, author of " The Courtship of Morrice Buckler," etc., and ANDREW LANO. With 

frontispiece by GORDON BROWXK. Crown 8vo, cloth, ornamental, $1.50. 

The story deals with the fortunes of an Irish Parson, without benifice, and a secret agent of the Pretender, in 
the early days of George I. The scenes are laid largely in England, and the author's pictures of London society 
and of the varied intrigues of that stirring time are graphic and striking. A pretty love story runs through the 
book and adds much to the reader's satisfaction as well as to that of the Parson. 

M< Parson Kelly ' is a beguiling variation on the old delightful theme. . . . Mr. Lang has brought to the com- 
position of this novel so much historical lore, so much insight into the Jacobite comedy, so much sympathy for the 
actors in it, both major and obscure, that the book is alive with true romance. The Prince scarcely appears, yet 
the air of plot and counterplot, of brave deeds and shabby intrigue, in which he and his house are enveloped, 
breathes from every page. . . . Historical knowledge and imaginative power are in Parson Kelly ' blended into 
a remarkably compact and plausible unit." Neic York Tribune.

Famous Men." 

This chronicle of the school-boy life and adventures of that 
famous trio, "Stalky." "Beetle," and " McTnrk," has spe- 
cial interest for all admirers of the author's early work. It 
shows " in the making " the strong, resourceful bearers of the 
" White Man's Burden " in India, to whom Mr. Kipling first 
introduced us.

The Brushwood Boy. 

Illustrated by ORSON LOWELL. 

" The Brushwood Boy " is unique, quite unlike anything 
else Mr. Kipling ever wrote, and some of his admirers think 
its dream quality and its almost mystical, poetic love-story 
show the author in his happiest mood . Mr. Lowell has treated 
this delicate fantasy in the sympathetic way that is charac- 
teristic of his artistic work, and the result is a truly charming 
volume. (In Frets.)

striking force and originality men who really count. It is 
very significant that one season can produce such a list from 
the " younger school " of our own West. 



The Gentleman from Indiana. 

10th Thousand. By BOOTH TARKINQTON. 

A strong and realistic novel of the " Middle West," which 
attracted much attention as a serial (much abridged) in 
JfrC/ure'*. The pictures of a country editor's life in Indiana 
are extraordinarily real, but the charm of the tale lies in the 
delicacy and romance of the love story that forms its basis, 
as well as its sustained interest.

BllX. By FRANK NORRIS. 

It would be difficult to imagine anything more different 
from Mr. Norm's last book than this charmine little love 
idyll of a young Californian reporter-novelist. Yet it shows 
the same vivid reality which caused Mr. Howells to point out 
" McTeague " as an "altogether remarkable book," abound- 
ing " in little miracles of observation, in vivid insight, in simple 
and subtle expression."

The Court of Boyville.

Mr. White has few equals as the delineator of the joys and 
woes of that strange genus, the Boy, and the chronicles of 
" Mealy " Jones, " Piggy " Pennington. and the other inhab- 
itants of " Boyville" are really fascinating. The attractive

an added distinction to a book which is quite unique.

A Romance of the Kansas Border Wart. 

Sons of Strength. 

By WILLIAM R. LIGHTON. 

The life history of a foundling child who goes to Kansas and 
takes part in the stirring struggle between the friends and 
opponents of slavery. The stern figure of John Brown is dra- 
matically introduced. As a romance dealing with a period of 
American history and a portion of our country practically un- 
touched in fiction, the bile is therefore notable.

Not for many years has any poem excited so much interest

" It is its eager sympathy, "says George Hum I in Kit oh, " which 
lifts it into the ranks of the great classics that will not die." 
This is the author's first collection of poems, with a photogra-

IDIOM AND IDEAL. 

Elizabeth Barrett, in one of her letters to 
Robert Browning, asked him whether he con- 
sidered " the sailor - idiom to be lawful in 
poetry," adding that, for her part, she does 
not. The reply runs as follows : " The Sailor 
Language is good in its way ; but as wrongly 
used in Art as real clay and mud would be, if 
one plastered them in the foreground of a land- 
scape in order to attain to so much truth." To all 
of this Miss Barrett assents, remarking further 
that " art without an ideal is neither nature nor 
art. The question involves the whole difference 
between Madame Tussaud and Phidias." 

The question of aesthetics thus raised is one 
of peculiar interest to the present period, and 
has become far more burning than it could 
have been when the above correspondence was 
exchanged. There are few features of the re- 
cent literary situation as noteworthy as the large 
production and wide vogue of writings which 
exploit some special form of idiom and rely for 
their main interest upon the appeal to curiosity 
thus made. The idiom of the sailor and the 
soldier, the rustic and the mechanic, have el- 
bowed their way into literature, and demand 
their share of the attention hitherto accorded 
chiefly to educated speech. The normal type 
of English expression has to jostle for recog- 
nition with the local and abnormal types of the 
Scotchman and the Irishman, the negro and the 
baboo, and, in our own country particularly, 
with such uncouth mixtures as those of the 
German - American and Scandinavian - Ameri- 
can. Examples lie upon every hand. We 
think at once of the " kailyard " group of story- 
tellers, of "Mr. Dooley " and Mr. Seumas Mc- 
Manus, of Mr. J. W. Eiley and " Charles Eg- 
bert Craddock," and, foremost among all these 
phenomena, of the writings of Mr. Kipling. 

An observer who looks beyond the momen- 
tary caprices of literary fashion is compelled ta 
ask, in the contemplation of so great a volume 
of dialect and specialized jargon, whether thia 
sort of work can claim to be literature in any 
high sense of the term. Does the speech of 
Tommy Atkins and Marse Chan, the dialect 
of Drumtochty and Donegal, the locution of 
the Hoosier farmer and the Bowery tough, 
have anything of the antiseptic quality that 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



preserves a story or a poem and enables it to 
delight successive generations of readers. The 
history of our literature is fairly instructive 
upon this point. With few exceptions, the 
writings of the past that have relied mainly 
upon their use of an abnormal idiom have 
passed completely out of the memory of men. 
It is true that such a novel as "The Anti- 
quary" and such a poem as "The Northern 
Farmer " have assured places among the works 
that live, but how easy it is to see that their 
idiom is merely an accident of their production, 
and not the determining motive. They survive 
in spite of their departure from accepted modes 
of expression, and not in consequence thereof. 
But nine-tenths of our latter-day jargon- 
mongers have for their whole stock-in-trade 
some grotesque form of English speech ; strip 
them of this, and the revelation of their poverty 
would be indeed pitiful. They offer novelty, 
and they amuse for an hour the novelty-seeking 
section of the public. A little later, their books 
collect dust upon the library shelves, and the 
counter of the dry-goods store sees them no more. 

The case of Mr. Kipling offers so typical an 
illustration of the proposition with which we 
are now concerned that it deserves close ex- 
amination. We should be the last to deny the 
noble qualities of Mr. Kipling's art in its finer 
manifestations. While it almost never gives 
evidence of that labor limes of which the really 
great masters are so lavish, its primesautier 
quality, its downright energy and superb emo- 
tional appeal, compel our admiration, and 
almost make us wish that the praise bestowed 
might be ungrudging. If we judge Mr. Kip- 
ling by his good work alone, as every poet has 
a right to be judged, he must be given a place 
among the dozen or so of living English singers 
who approach most closely the height now oc- 
cupied in solitary eminence by Mr. Swinburne. 
As a writer of prose narrative he has taken a 
lesson from Mr. Bret Harte, and bettered the 
instruction. He is not one of the great novel- 
ists, but the best of his stories have a fair 
chance of being read well along in the twentieth 
century. So much, and possibly more, must 
be accorded him by every sober-minded critic. 

But between this measured and deserved 
praise on the one hand, and the wild acclaim 
of Mr. Kipling's present vogue on the other, 
there is a great gulf fixed. And when we 
come to inquire into the causes of the vogue, 
we find that it has little to do with his best 
work. It is the " Danny Deever " sort of poem, 
and not "The English Flag" sort of poem, 



which nine out of ten of his vociferous ad- 
mirers have in mind when they proclaim him a 
poet after their own heart ; and it is the Mul- 
vaney sort of story, rather than " The Finest 
Story in the World," that they are really 
thinking of when they assert that he is first 
and the rest nowhere among story-tellers. A 
vogue that is based upon such judgments as 
these has a precarious vitality, and the reasons 
for which Mr. Kipling will be held in honor- 
able literary remembrance are very different 
from those that determine his present popu- 
larity. It may be said that "The Recessional " 
affords common ground upon which the man of 
taste and the groundling may stand in voicing 
the praises of its author. This is, no doubt, a 
fine poem, although not without obvious faults, 
and it is greatly to the credit of the uncritical 
public that the poem found so responsive an 
echo in so many hearts. But when we find 
many of the same voices raised in .'prai.se of 
"The White Man's Burden," apparently not 
knowing the difference between the two, the 
situation " gives to think," as the French say. 
And when we hear " The Recessional " recited 
approvingly by men who deny that their own 
nation should ever, no matter how greatly it has 
sinned, make the " ancient sacrifice " of " an hum- 
ble and a contrite heart," - by men, in short, 
upon whose lips such words are blasphemy, 
we may see the difference between lip-service and 
sympathetic appreciation of a poem, and take 
at something like its true value the popular esti- 
mate of this particular poem and its author. 

" The sailor language is good in its way," 
as Browning said ; but it is not the way of 
great literature. And the same observation 
holds true of the soldier language, and the 
locomotive - driver language, and the Anglo- 
Indian language. 

" For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an ' Chuck him out, 

the brute ! ' 

But it's ' Saviour of 'is country ' when the Runs begin to shoot ; 
An' it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' anything you 

please; 
An' Tommy ain't a hloomin 1 fool you bet that Tommy 

sees!" 

This sort of thing is amusing, and vigorous, 
and even ethically sound ; but it is not litera- 
ture, for it does not square with the sober defi- 
nitions. What, for example, has it to do with 
Mr. Morley's "Literature consists of all the 
books . . . where moral truth and human pas- 
sion are touched with a certain largeness, sanity, 
and attractiveness of form"? And what re- 
motest point of contact does it have with this 
statement of Pater's abstract jestheticism : "All 
art constantly aspires toward the condition of 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



307 



music music, then, and not poetry, as is so 
often supposed, is the true type or measure of 
perfected art"? Not merely does the bulk of 
Mr. Kipling's work and of the work of those 
countless lesser writers among whom he occu- 
pies a typical position fail to become art in 
anything like this transcendental sense, but it 
does not even seek to be art in the narrow sense 
that takes literature to be a self-contained pro- 
cess, with its own exclusive ideals. It does not 
aim to be ideal at all, but tries to outdo the 
rudest realism hitherto known. Reverting once 
more to Browning's trenchant comment, it 
plasters its clay and mud in the foreground of 
the landscape, and wins a cheap popular ap- 
plause for its deftness, while the judicious stand 
apart and grieve at so violent a renunciation of 
idealism. For art, to be art at all, must be 
ideal. While it is true that 

" Beyond that art 

Which you say adds to nature, is an art 
That nature makes," 

it nevertheless remains the duty of the artist to 
add to nature in the measure permitted by his 
imagination; failing in this task, or deliberately 
eschewing it, he is recreant to his calling, and 
his work has no excuse for existence. 



POE COMING TO HIS KINGDOM. 

To one who tries to study Literature in the large, 
it seems as if we were just now passing through one 
of those irritating transition periods in which all 
standards are lowered or confused, in which Con- 
glomeration reigns, taste gets freaky or fantastical, 
and True Art hides her head or goes to sleep. Of 
course, all periods are transitional ; but some by 
their accentuation acquire the especial name, when 
literary or historic annals are compiled, and balances 
just, or approximate, are struck. 

But, irritating as the present period may or must 
be to the subtlest nerves of criticism, it is not with- 
out its assuring signs, its cloudless promises. The 
most cheering of present omens more than an 
omen ; indeed, almost a right earnest is the final 
rendering of complete literary justice in the land of 
his birth to that genuine man of letters whom the 
critical consensus of Europe has long acclaimed as 
our greatest literary genius. The recognition is 
rather late, but, clearly, it is to be lasting. Edgar 
Allan Poe, " the Yankee Yahoo," a stupid English 
reviewer once called him, " that jingle-man " Emer- 
son with unwonted blindness or bitterness labelled 
him, while Lowell, who knew better, spoke of him 
as " three-fifths genius and two-fifths sheer fudge," 
has come, at last, to his kingdom. When the 
University of Virginia, the Alma Mater from which 
he was not expelled and where he was never cen- 
sured even for alleged vices then common among 



the sons of Virginian gentry, honored his memory, 
but chiefly itself, by celebrating on October seventh 
the fiftieth anniversary of his untimely death, and 
by unveiling, with fitting ceremonies of prayer, 
poem, and address, a fine bust by an excellent 
sculptor, this long-delayed rendition of poetic justice, 
this formal recognition in America of his world-wide 
fame and genius, was made complete. 

The choice of essayist for the occasion may be 
fairly considered a happy inspiration on the part of 
the committee, Professors Kent and Harrison. Mr. 
Hamilton W. Mabie rose to his theme easily, and 
in the agreement of all brother critics who had the 
pleasure of hearing him deliver his choicely chosen 
phrases, he surpassed all his former adventures in 
the field of criticism. Mr. Mabie happily steered 
between the Scylla of loose laudation and the 
Charybdis of exaggeration where so many admirers 
of Poe have been drowned, and at the same time 
he announced that Poe was entitled to the first place 
in American letters by virtue of possessing a most 
exacting literary conscience and producing works 
of the clearest and finest art. His essay, which 
will appear soon in the " Atlantic Monthly," and to 
which I eagerly commend all readers of THE DIAL, 
was as convincing in its equations as it was tem- 
perate in its eloquence. 

But more convincing still as to Poe's position at 
the present day were the letters which arrived from 
all parts of the country, in which many of the most 
justly distinguished men and women of the literary 
craft paid cordial tribute to the great man whom 
his own day and generation kept close on the brink 
of starvation and stimulated to seek solace in those 
occasional excesses to which, most unfortunately, 
he appears to have had a terrible pre-natal bias. It 
was clear from those letters, too, that not only has 
the silly old sectional animosity, at the bottom of so 
much general mischief and operant to a consider- 
able degree against Poe in his life, entirely vanished, 
but that an almost absolute unanimity of opinion as 
to his literary merits has come in the literary world. 
Few names of any importance or promise of perma- 
nence were missing from the illustrious list of those 
whose letters hailed Poe as America's most illustrious 
writer and most luminous literary influence. Thus, 
indeed, was verified by example Professor Minto's 
apt dictum years ago : " The feelings to which Poe 
appeals are simple but universal, and he appeals to 
them with a force that has never been surpassed." 
Mr. Minto should have written " power " instead of 
" force." The distinction is infinite, though fine ; and 
was never more applicable than in the case of Poe's 
writings. There is no blare of trumpets, no firing 
of rockets, in the main and mass of Poe's work. 
Nearly all are developed in the calm of a sure ele- 
mental energy. Even his " pot-boilers " bear traces 
of this power and of that splendid conscientiousness 
on which Mr. Mabie did not harp any too much. 

Such a vast amount of twaddle has been circu- 
lated about Poe's personal character, his bad habits, 
his lack of moral perceptions, his indifference to the 



308 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



esteem of his fellow men, that one shrinks from 
dignifying it with much attention or keeping alive 
the poor little fames of Foe's chief libellers by 
citing their names with their absurd accusations. 
Lowell's little outfling of unworthy spleen can be 
easily forgiven. Foe forgave it in advance by de- 
fending Lowell from an English blackguard of the 
pen, and proclaiming Lowell as one of the noblest 
poets America had then produced. Emerson, who 
was a greater poet in the rough, to my mind, than 
Lowell, must be pardoned for his bitterness Foe 
had ridiculed his proneness to play Sir Oracle ; or 
possibly it was not bitterness, but a mere blindness 
to Foe's art and a deafness to Foe's music. Yet Foe 
was recognized in a measure, when alive, by men 
of real intellectual fibre. There is the recognition 
of hostility as well as that of cordial appreciation 
and friendship. Perhaps, too, there is in it more cer- 
tainty of permanent fame and influence. That Foe 
enjoyed his isolation, to some degree, is not unlikely. 
Some natures, though not unphilanthropic, are at- 
tuned for solitude : some talents ripen in the shade. 
There has been, it seems to me, considerable mis- 
chief done to Foe and the cause of truth by the over- 
zeal of some of his champions. The medial sound 
fact of this whole matter appears to be that Foe, 
though an almost perfect artist, scarcely deserved 
that any man should pray to him every morning as 
Baudelaire used to do ; that Foe, though possessed of 
many winning and gracious attributes when sane, did 
some dreadful and dreadfully strange things, when 
not in sober senses ; that, as he happened to be a man 
of genius and temperament combative at all times, his 
flaws and failings, which would have passed compar- 
atively unnoticed in an ordinary person, got blazoned 
broadcast to the world. HENRY AUSTIN. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE MEANING OF "THE MAN WITH THE HOE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The comment of your reviewer, in THE DIAL of Oct. 
1, on Mr. Markham's poem of " The Man with the Hoe" 
is fairer than a great many things said on the subject, 
but still seems to me not quite to the point. 

" The Man with the Hoe " as conceived by Millet 
and understood by Mr. Mark ham, I suggest, is not the 
product of ordinary social conditions nor the represen- 
tative of the ordinary agricultural class. It is surely 
a misapprehension of Mr. Markham's thought to sup- 
pose he meant to reflect on that class, that he looked 
on Millet's delineation as typical of them, or that he 
charged such a prod net to Labor. 

It is not labor, duly rewarded and performed under 
conditions benefitting the dignity of human nature, that 
produces the man depicted by the painter. It is op- 
pression labor without compensation, the hardship 
and wrong of toil and sacrifice unrequited, an undue 
share of the burden of government running through 
long periods, that ripens such deadly fruit. Such were 
the conditions that led, by a long and toilsome road, 
down to the French revolution. Mr. Markham, with the 
vision of a seer, sees the menace of related conditions, 



to result from not unlike causes, in the darkening and 
not remote future even in this most favored land. 

In the first volume of Carlyle's " French Revolution," 

, where be is digging down to the causes that underlay 

the mighty convulsion which is the subject of his history, 

he sees with reverted eye "the twenty-five million* 

working people " of France " with whom it is not so 

well"; whom "we lump together," be says, "into a 

I dim, compendious unity, monstrous but dim, far off, as 

the canaille "', whom he follows "over broad France, 

into their clay hovels, into their garrets and hutches"; 

! masses yet units, " every unit of whom has his own heart 

and sorrows; stands covered there with his own skin," 

and who if you "prick him" will "bleed" . . . 

"Dreary, languid do these struggle in their obscure 

remoteness; their hearth cheerless, their diet thin. For 

them in this world rises no Era of Hope. . . . Untaught, 

uncomforted, unfed! A dumb generation; their voice 

only an inarticulate cry. ... At rare intervals (as now 

in 1775) they will fling down their hoes and hammers, 

and to the astonishment of thinking mankind flock 

{ hither and thither, dangerous, aimless; get the length 

I even of Versailles "; where in May, 1775, in answer to 

! their Petition of Grievances, " two of them are hanged 

I on a 'new gallows forty feet high,' and the rest driven 

: back to their dens for a time." 

Further along in the same chapter, the elder Mira- 
I beau describes the " Man with the Hoe " as he saw him 
j from his Iodging.s at the Baths of Mt. D'Or: 

"The savages descending in torrents from the mountains 
I ... frightful men, or rather frightful wild animals, clad in 
, jupes of coarse woolen, with large girdles of leather studded 
with copper nails; of gigantic stature, heightened by high 
wooden sabots . . . their faces haggard and covered with 
their long greasy hair ; the upper part of the visage waxing 
pale, the lower distorting itself into the attempt at a cruel 
laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience. And these people 
pay the taille .' And yon want further to take their salt from 
them ! And you know not what it is you are stripping barer, 
or, as yon call it, governing ; what, by the spurt of your pen, 
in its cold, dastard indifference, you will fancy you can starve 
always with impunity ; always till the catastrophe come!' 1 
Thus the old Marquis. And in the next chapter Carlyle : 
" Before those five and twenty laboring millions could get 
that haggardness of face, which old Mirabean now looks on, 
in a nation calling itself Christian and calling man the brother 
of man what unspeakable, nigh-infinite Dishonesty in all 
manner of Rulers, and appointed Watchers, spiritual and 
temporal, must there not through long ages have gone on 
accumulating ! " 

It was such woes as these, cumulating through centu- 
ries down to the States General, to the fall of the Bas- 
tille, to the later Terror, such woes as no other civilized 
country ever produced or endured that Mr. Markham 
must have seen in Millet's distorted image of outraged 
humanity when he penned that last expressive stanza: 
" O, masters, lords and rulers in all lands, 
How will the future reckon with this man ? 
How answer his brute question in that hour 
When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world ? 
How will it be with kingdoms and with kings 
With those who shaped him to the thing he is 
When this dumb terror shall reply to God 
After the silence of the centuries ?" 
History has recorded, in characters never to be ex- 
punged, the answer to this " brute question " when it 
was asked in the stormy days of Louis Capet and Marie 
Antoinette; and we may depend that whenever and 
wherever even if it should be in this "land of the 
free" a like question presents itaelf, the answer will 
be of like character.

THE DIAL

Mr. Markham's poem is not only interpreted but 
justified by history and by economic philosophy. It is 
an arraignment of forces that are gathering a menac- 
ing power for evil in this country. It is, in his own 
words, " A protest that is also a prophecy."

HAST THOU SEEN YOUR FATHER? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Is there anyone at all trained in speech who would 
to-day use such a conjunction of pronouns as the above, 
or whose ear would not be offended by it if it were 
read or spoken by another ? Teachers of foreign lan- 
guages are brought into such constant contact with the 
offence through slovenly translations that they become 
perhaps morbidly sensitive to it. Therefore I ask the 
question seriously. Inasmuch as neither ' thou ' nor ' ye ' 
is any longer used in common speech, our feeling for 
the nice use of them is of course less quick and instinct- 
ive than in the case of, let us say, verbal agreement. 

The general distinctions between the three pronouns 
of the second person, especially as observed in earlier 
stages of the language, are familiar enough : ' thou ' 
from superiors to inferiors, among equals when intimate, 
and for the familiarity of endearment or contempt ; 
'ye' from inferiors to superiors, and of course as the 
plural of 'thou'; 'you,' originally the encroachment of 
the oblique cases of ' ye ' upon the nominative, then the 
formal and polite plural and singular where the feeling 
for ' thou ' or ' ye ' was not strong, and finally the sole 
customary form both singular and plural. In literature 
the use of ' thou ' and ' ye,' singular and plural respect- 
ively, secures the general effect of elevation ; while 
there is more or less attempt to retain the old distinc- 
tion between ' thou ' and ' ye ' singular, the result of the 
latter usage being a degree of archaism. When a 
transition is made from 'you' to ' thou ' or ' ye,' it is 
common to seek for a corresponding change in attitude 
on the part of the speaker. 

But it will not do to insist upon intention in this 
direction, even in the best writers. No writer of our 
time has written more in the loftiest tone than Tennyson. 
In " The Idyls of the King," not only is there the gen- 
eral elevation of style which is expected in the epic and 
the heroic drama, but there is a studied archaism which 
would warrant us in anticipating the nice distinctions 
of the older stages of the language. But the master 
has disappointed me so sorely that I almost hesitate to 
criticize any longer even such a sentence as that which 
I have used for a title to this note. ' Thou,' ' thyself,' 
'you,' 'yourself,' and 'ye' are used almost if not 
altogether without discrimination. The only limitation 
that even looks like a distinction is in the language used 
by and to Arthur. Of eighteen persons to whom he 
speaks, he uses ' thou ' alone to thirteen. The exceptions 
are Guinevere, to whom in " Elaine " he uses ' thou,' ye,' 
and 'you'; Lynette, to whom he uses both 'thou' and 
' ye '; Geraint, to whom he uses only ' ye '; and Gawain, 
to whom he uses all three of the simple forms. Arthur 
uses ' ye ' and ' you ' in but three idyls " Elaine," " The 
Last Tournament," and " Gareth and Lynette." On the 
other hand, of eighteen persons who speak to Arthur, 
only three use any pronoun but ' thou.' These are Guine- 
vere, who uses all three, in " Guinevere " and " The Last 
Tournament "; Lancelot, who in " Guinevere " once uses 
'you'; and Gareth, who uses 'thou' and 'ye.' 

I have examined the numerical balance in the case of 



Guinevere, Lancelot, and the others, but find no evident 
preference for one pronoun or another, and no distinction 
in their application. Without citing the many changes 
from one situation or speech to another, I will give a 
few illustrations of changes within one and the same 
speech. The first is from " Gareth and Lynette," about 
140 lines from the beginning, Bellicent speaking: 
" Ay, go then, and ye must : only one proof, 

Before thou ask the King to make thee knight, 

Of thine obedience and thy love to me, 

Thy mother, I demand." 

Or again, about line 740, Lancelot speaking : 
"Nay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King, 

For that did never he whereon ye rail. 

But ever meekly served the King in thee." 
Again, some 95 lines further, the stranger baron speak- 
ing to Gareth: 

" Good now, ye have saved a life 

Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood. 

And fain would I reward thee worehipfully. 

What guerdon will ye ? " 

Finally, to pass from this idyl, about 108 lines from the 
end, Lynette speaking to Gareth : 

" I curse the tongue that all thro' yesterday 
Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now 
To lend thee horse and shield : wonders ye have done ; 
Miracles ye cannot : here is glory enow 
In having flung the three : I see thee maimed. 
Mangled : I swear thou canst not fling the fourth." 
It may be noted here that neither in Gareth and 
Lynette," nor in " Geraint and Enid," nor in any other 
case in which there is an estrangement or a misunder- 
standing followed by a reconciliation, is there any 
change in the pronouns of address corresponding to 
the change in moods and relations. 

Similar passages could be quoted from almost any of 
the Idyls, but I will content myself with a few more 
examples, from " The Last Tournament." Thus, in the 
third paragraph, Arthur to Guinevere: 

"Peace to thine eagle-borne 
Dead nestling, and this honor after death, 
Following thy will ! But, O my queen, I muse 
Why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone 
Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn, 
And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear." 
In her reply to this, Guinevere, in addressing the King, 
uses all three pronouns in the course of twelve lines. 
And further on, in the dialogue between Tristram and 
Dagonet, the latter says: 

" Knight, an ye fling those rubies ronnd my neck 
In lien of hers, I'll hold thon hast some touch 
Of music, since I care not for thy pearls. 



Swine, say ye ? swine, goats, asses, rams, and geese 
Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed 
On such a wire as musically as thou 
Some such fine song but never a king's fool." 
The only case which is not to be found in the Idyls is 
that of two different pronouns in one and the same 
clause. But the only difference between an example 
like that in the heading of this note and those I have 
cited is that the solecism is more obvious the closer 
together the pronouns stand. 

I have asked myself how it was possible to read the 
Idyls, as I did for years, without being offended by this 
usage, which would certainly have annoyed me in a stu- 
dent or a lesser poet. My only explanation is that the spell 
of the splendid style was so strong upon me as to to blind 
me to such minor matters. |y^ jj CARRUTH

A MEMOIR OF DEAN L.IDDELL.* 

Dr. Thompson modestly styles his compact 
and matterful memoir of the late Dean of 
Christ Church a compilation, inasmuch as its 
texture largely consists of letters to and from 
the Dean, together with recollections gathered 
from former friends and colleagues who are 
particularly well qualified to speak of him, and 
an autobiographical fragment treating of his 
earlier years and extending to 1834. All this 
material, with just the necessary amplification, 
is marshalled with good judgment, largely in 
logical rather than chronological order, and 
with a sense of the uses and virtues of literary 
compression and editorial sifting that one duly 
appreciates in a day when overgrown biog- 
raphies are by no means exceptional. As a re- 
sult, we get a solid and satisfying volume of 
280 clearly printed pages, from which readers 
even with little or no antecedent knowledge of 
Dean Liddell can gain a just general concep- 
tion of his eminent services to classical schol- 
arship, and an edifying impression of his noble 
and stately, if somewhat frigid and awesome, 
personality. 

Henry George Liddell was born on February 
6, 1811, at Winchester, near Auckland. His 
father, then curate of the adjoining parish of 
Southchurch, was not long afterwards made 
Rector of Boldon, a village midway between 
Stockton and Newcastle, which thus became 
the home of his boyhood. He was early set on 
the high-road to his future distinctions. " On 
my sixth birthday," he says, " I was promised 
a great honor and reward. My father took me 
up into his study and inducted me into the 
mysteries of the Eton Latin Grammar." At 
twelve, Liddell was sent to Charterhouse School, 
where he remained till 1829. His Charthusian 
days were not pleasant ones (he recalls a letter 
to his father forcibly dated from " Beastly 
Charterhouse"), nor, it would seem, very stren- 
uous ones, for a certain master, of a prophetic 
turn, used to say of him, coram publico, that 
he was " as lazy as he was long, and should 
bring his father's grey hairs in sorrow to the 
grave." While in the Sixth Form at Charter- 
house his desk-fellow was Thackeray, who is 
the subject of some interesting passages.

Oxford: A Memoir. 87 Her. Henry L. Thompson, M.A.

" He never attempted to learn the lesson, never ex- 
erted himself to grapple with Horace. We spent our 
time mostly in drawing, with such skill as we could 
command. [In later life] he often used to join Mrs. 
Liddell and myself when riding in Rotten Row. On 
one occasion he turned to her and said: Your husband 
ruined all my prospects in life; he did all my Latin 
verses for me, and I lost all opportunities of self- 
improvement. . . .' At this time < Vanity Fair ' was 
coming out. He used to talk about it, and what he 
should do with the persons. Mrs. Liddell one day said, 
<Ob, Mr. Thackeray, you must let Dobbin marry 
Amelia.' ' Well, he replied, ' be shall ; and when he 
has got her, he will not find her worth having.' " 

Despite the dismal prediction of the master, 
and the trifling with Thackeray, Liddell left 
Charterhouse well trained in Greek and Latin, 
though within a narrow range of authors. In 
1830 he went up to Christ Church, and a long 
course of hard reading, rewarded from time to 
time by academic triumphs and substantial pre- 
ferments, followed. 

In 1833 Liddell gained a Double First Class 
in the Final Examination, and in January, 
1836, he became Tutor, having in the interim 
worked hard at French and German, and at 
Divinity, for he had now made up his mind to 
enter Holy Orders. While Tutor, he first met 
Ruskin, who speaks of him in his Praeterita," 
it may be remembered, as " one of the rarest 
types of nobly-presenced Englishmen," and 
the only man in Oxford among the masters 
of my day who knew anything of art." We 
shall quote, later on, from an interesting letter 
of Ruskin's to the Dean, one of several which 
form a valuable portion of the correspondence 
given by Dr. Thompson. 

At Christmas, 1836, Liddell was ordained. 
At this period the influence of Newman and 
Pusey was already a mighty and disturbing one 
at Oxford ; and while it is clear that Liddell 
was by no means swept away from his orthodox 
Anglican moorings by the powerful current of 
the Tractarian movement, it would be a mis- 
take to infer that he was not stirred by it, or 
that he was wholly proof against the spell of 
the great theologian of Oriel. Though ten 
years Newman's junior, he enjoyed some de- 
gree of intimacy with him, and he made at his 
request one or two of the translations from 
ancient documents which appeared in the 
" Library of the Fathers." But Liddell's tastes 
were at no time ecclesiastical, and he thor- 
oughly disliked controversy. His interest, 
therefore, in the clerical debates which so shook 
minds of a certain type was comparatively lan- 
guid that, we should say, of a perfunctorily 
sympathizing spectator who desired nothing so

much as the cessation of a quarrel the scandal 
of which to the common cause of religion was 
much more patent to secular and positive minds 
than the importance or essentiality of its 
grounds. In a sermon preached at Christ 
Church in 1890 he recalled some memories of 
Newman, and took occasion to add, in his 
liberal and clear-sighted way : 

" But one thing I cannot but notice, that, whereas 
most of those who leave the Church of their fathers, be 
it the Church of this realm or another, proved to be the 
bitterest enemies of that Church, Cardinal Newman 
never followed that unworthy course. He had convinced 
himself that there were things in our Church that he 
could not away with, and that he should find in the 
Roman Church a satisfaction and a cure. But he did 
not, therefore, as the manner of many is, assail us with 
acrimonious criticisms or contemptuous reproach; and 
if at times he replied to attacks somewhat sharply, he 
seemed to do so in obedience to the imperious and 
inflexible principles of his new mistress." 

Contrasting the style of Cardinal Newman 
with that of Dr. Liddon, Dean Liddell con- 
tinued : 

"I seem to see John Henry Newman standing (to 
use a familiar phrase) bolt upright in the pulpit, with 
spectacles on nose, with arms as it were pinned to his 
sides, never using the slightest action except to turn 
over the leaves of his sermon, trusting entirely for effect 
to the modulation of a voice most melodious, but rang- 
ing, I believe, through a very limited scale, yet rivetting 
the attention of his hearers as if they were spellbound. 
. . . We marvelled how so little apparent effort was 
followed by effects so great and permanent." 

In 1838 Liddell was appointed Greek Read- 
er in Christ Church, and in 1845 he was elected 
White's Professor of Moral Philosophy. In 
1846 his appointment as domestic Chaplain to 
the Prince Consort opened the way to a friend- 
ship with the members of the royal family, 
which was evidenced in 1859 by the placing, 
at the Queen's request, of the Prince of Wales 
under his charge at Oxford. Liddell was not, 
as may be readily believed, what is called a 
popular preacher not a preacher who could 
have drawn or swayed the crowds that flocked 
to hear Spurgeon at the Tabernacle. What 
we may venture to term the cheaper rhet- 
orical arts of pulpit oratory were as foreign to 
his manner as to Newman's. The effectiveness 
of his sermons was not of the evanescent sort 
that lies largely in graces of manner, witchery 
of voice, or what is known as magnetism of 
presence. They read well. His language, says 
Dr. Thompson, " was always severely simple, 
but never lacking in stateliness and beauty. 
He was rarely, if ever, controversial ; he de- 
sired to go beyond controversy, and exhibit 
Divine Truth in a more exalted relation." 



" One of the most remarkable sermons I have 
ever listened to," Sir Robert Peel was heard to 
say, while leaving the Chapel Royal, White- 
hall, where Liddell had been preaching on the 
text, "Stretch forth thy hand." 

Liddell's marriage to Miss Lorina Reeve, in 
1846, was followed by his resignation of his 
office, at Oxford, and his acceptance of the 
Headinastership of Westminster School. This 
ancient foundation had latterly sunk into a 
declining and apparently moribund condition, 
and it was thought that the governance and 
reputation of a man like Liddell would go far 
toward restoring its former prestige and num- 
bers. During his eleven years' incumbency at 
Westminster, Liddell did much to justify the 
confidence thus placed in him ; but he became 
convinced at last that the proximity of the school 
to London was a bar to its progress which could 
not be overcome ; and he was about to accept 
the Mastership of Sherburn Hospital, Durham, 
when the death of Dean Glaisford, of Christ 
Church, marked a sudden turn in his fortunes, 
which had not perhaps been entirely unforeseen. 
There was scarcely a doubt that Liddell would 
be Dean Glaisford's successor ; and on June 6, 
1855, a letter from Lord Elcho notified him of 
his appointment by Palmerston to the office 
which he was to fill with such usefulness,, dig- 
nity, and distinction for a period of thirty-six 
years, or up to within six years of his death 
in 1898. 

One-half of the memoir before us is devoted 
to an account of Liddell's decanal career at 
Christ Church, his constitutional and archi- 
tectural reforms, his methods and peculiarities 
of administration, his good work as Curator 
of University Galleries, the battles on behalf 
of liberty fought by him and Stanley in the 
Chapter largely an ultra-conservative body 
containing, said Stanley, " very explosive ele- 
ments." The Jowett question is very briefly 
touched upon, as is that which arose over the 
Boden Professorship of Sanscrit. In these and 
kindred academical issues Liddell and Stanley, 
it is hardly necessary to say, fought successfully 
the battle of reform and liberalism against what 
may be termed the conservative mandarinate 
of Christ Church. " Fuit Ilium I " one of these 
worthy, if mistaken champions of old-fogyism 
dolefully exclaimed, on realizing the uselessness 
of further resistance to the changes of 1858, 
which have since proved so salutary.

days, and resulted in his acceptance, at Lid-

dell's instance, of the Slade Professorship at 
Oxford. ID a letter of 1837 Liddell thus de- 
scribed the author of " Modern Painters" as 
he first knew him: 

" He is a very strange fellow, always dressing in a 
greatcoat with a brown velvet collar, and a large neck- 
cloth tied over his mouth, and living quite in his own 
way among the odd set of hunting and sporting men 
that gentlemen commoners usually are. ... I am glad 
to say they do not bully him, as I should have been 
afraid they would." 

In 1844 Ruskin wrote, in reply to a letter 
in which Liddell seems to have made some 
complaints of the style of " Modern Painters " : 

"But alas! there is nothing of all the little that you 
say in stricture which I do not feel and which I 
have not felt for some time back. . . . But it seems to 
me the pamphleteer manner is not confined to these 
passages: it is ingrained throughout There is a nasty, 
snappish, impatient, half-familiar, half-claptrap web of 
young-mannishness everywhere. I am going to try for 
better things; for a serious, quiet, earnest, and simple 
manner, like the execution I want in art. . . . Don't 
suppose, however, I am going to lose Turner. On the 
contrary, I am more tpris than ever, and that especially 
with his latest works, Goldau, etc. Monomania, you 
think. Possibly. ..." 

In a later letter, Ruskin goes on to say, as 
to " versatility of admiration " : 

" The world is so old, that there is no dearth of things 
first-rate; and life so short, that there is no excuse for 
looking at things second-rate. Let us then go to Rubens 
for blending, and to Titian for quality, of color; to Cag- 
liari for daylight, and Rembrandt for lamplight ; to 
Buonarroti for awf illness, and to Van Huysum for pre- 
cision. . . . Any man is worthy of respect, in his own 
rank, who has pursued any truth or attainment with all 
his heart and strength. But I dread and despise the 
artists who are respectable in many things, and have 
been excelled by some one in everything. . . . Murillo 
seems to me a peculiar instance of this. . . . He was 
not a bad painter, but he exercises a most fatal influence 
on the English school. I have never entered the Dul- 
wich Gallery for fourteen years without seeing at least 
three copyists before the Murillos. I never have seen 
one before the Paul Veronese." 

Perhaps Mr. Ruskin's unaccountably heated 
expression, " I dread and despise," fairly ex- 
emplifies the defect of manner admitted in the 
earlier letter. " Do n't bear on too hard" urges 
Mr. Lowell somewhere ; and we know of few 
maxims of the kind more useful than this one. 
A chapter is of course devoted to the history 
of the Dean's magnum opus, the Greek-Eng- 
lish Lexicon, a monument of labors begun in 
his student days and continued almost to the 
close of his life. Liddell and Scott are names 
that will long hunt in couples in the brain of 
student and scholar. The first edition of the 
Lexicon was issued in 1834 ; but that date 
marks only the completion of the first stage in 



the undertaking. Through a period of fifty- 
four years the task of improving and correct- 
ing the work, of keeping it abreast of the ad- 
vance of modern scholarship, was never inter- 
mitted, the eighth edition being published in 
1897, ten years after Scott's death, and only a 
few months before his venerable colaborer was 
called to his rest. Apropos of the Lexicon, 
and the inevitable defects of the first edition of 
it, let us subjoin a Westminster story, which is 
amusing enough in itself, and may serve the 
additional end of providing a key to proper 
pronunciation of the, we think, often mispro- 
nounced name of Liddell. There was an 
irreverent schoolboy tradition current at West- 
minster in Liddell's day that when, during 
class-work, an error would crop out in the 
Lexicon, the Headmaster would serenely ob- 
serve : " Ah, yes ; Mr. Scott wrote that para- 
graph." This gave rise to the following epi- 
gram which was heartily enjoyed and even 
pecuniarily rewarded by its dignified but kindly 
victim. 

"Two men wrote a Lexicon, Liddell and Scott; 
Some parts were clever, but some parts were not. 
Hear, all ye learned, and read me this riddle, 
How the wrong: part wrote Scott, and the right part 
wrote Liddell."

THE HEART OF THE CIVIL WAR.* 

The third volume of Mr. James Ford Rhodes's 
"History of the United States from the Com- 
promise of 1850," closed with the recounting 
of the military movements of the winter and 
spring of 1862. The fourth volume, just pub- 
lished, continues the story until Abraham Lin- 
coln is reflected, General Grant is in successful 
command of the Army of the Potomac, and the 
end of the great contest is in sight. It deals 
with as many perplexing problems as were ever 
crowded together in any like two-year period 
in the annals of time. 

The task must have been an appalling one, 
to enter this field of bitter controversy, to sift 
thoroughly the great mass of material in the 
form of -personal memoirs," "own stories," 
" recollections," newspaper files, and the nu- 
merous volumes of Official Records of the War 
of the Rebellion, and still hope for a resulting 
narration which should commend itself to the 
judgment of this generation of students as wor- 
thy to be passed on to the future as a fair and

trustworthy account of the most trying years 
in American history. 

No one can read this volume without being 
impressed with the naturalness of the story. 
Mr. Rhodes seems to have caught that most 
happy style for the expression of his thoughts 
which makes the reader follow him willingly 
to his conclusions. One step succeeds another ; 
and as public opinion at the time was modified 
under the influence of changing conditions, so 
the reader finds his own ideas re-shaped as his 
knowledge grows with the unfolding of the 
story. 

The Army of the Potomac was long the cen- 
tre of the thoughts of the people of the North. 
Its inactivity or activity was everywhere dis- 
cussed. Each of the several commanders who 
attempted to satisfy the carping critics was the 
target for the fire of every newspaper writer, 
jealous brother officer, and store-box tactician 
of the day. Hence many a reader of this volume 
will take the treatment accorded to General 
McClellan as a test topic. For a time there is 
severe condemnation, until it seems that the 
author is too much prejudiced. Then comes a 
page where the opinion is moderated ; then 
criticism is harsh again, until it is apparent 
that the account of McClellan is just what is 
most to be desired a judicious examination 
of his merits and demerits, with unsparing blame 
where he manifestly was at fault, with a due 
amount of recognition of those excellences 
which made him the idol of his soldiers and the 
chosen leader of a large minority of his fellow- 
citizens. The general impression of the story 
as a whole is unfavorable to McClellan, and 
there is a natural query in the mind of the 
reader as to whether this result of the first 
serious attempt to write the history of the Civil 
War without passion, according to modern his- 
torical methods, and in connection with a survey 
of a wider period of the nation's life, is to be 
taken as the final judgment upon the career of 
this famous soldier and party leader. 

The same impression of judicial fairness is 
gained from the account of the work of other 
men Burnside, Pope, Buell, Halleck, Hooker, 
Meade, and Lee. In considering men and 
measures outside of military lines, also, this 
judicial tact has been displayed. Stanton and 
Chase, Seward and Lincoln, are seen in the 
light of the time, as events developed and they 
developed with them. Even Lincoln stands 
forth as he was during this critical period of 
his administration, not viewed with the halo 
which late years have placed about him, but 



marked by weakness and faults, or elements of 
strength, as he displayed now one and now 
another quality in the midst of the tremendous 
cares of state. 

More difficult than the task of properly 
measuring the standard for general and cabinet 
officers and president was that of giving a fair 
account of the acts and influence of those par- 
tisan leaders in the North who differed from 
the ruling party in their ideas of the proper 
method of dealing with the rebelling states, men 
like Seymour and Vallandingham and others 
who were called " Copperheads " by the sup- 
porters of the government. While it is per- 
fectly apparent that the author believes that 
the Democratic party failed in what might 
have been its legitimate mission as a correcting 
and restraining party of opposition, and that 
many things which closely approached " giving 
aid and comfort to the enemy" are justly 
charged against it, there is a clear recognition 
of much that is of worth in some of the speeches 
of its leaders ; there is due praise especially 
for many of Governor Seymour's acts ; and, on 
the other hand, there is unsparing condemna- 
tion of the illegal arrests and suppression of 
newspapers which attended the radical side 
of the controversies. What is most to be com- 
mended is the clearness of narration which 
enables the reader to see just how it came 
to pass that men could feel as they did at the 
time, whether they were "Union Leaguers" or 
"Copperheads." 

There can be no doubt that the growing 
tendency in present-day discussions of the Civil 
War is to overlook the bitterness and harshness 
of the time, to feel that the triumph of the 
Union was demanded by destiny, to accept the 
downfall of human slavery as a result pleasing 
to both sides, and to exalt the heroism shown 
by Americans in battle, whether they fought 
under the stars or the bars. After a stirring 
account of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, one 
sentence claims attention : 

" Decry war as we may and ought, ' breathes there 
the man with soul so dead ' who would not thrill with 
emotion to claim for his countrymen the men who made 
that charge and the men who met it?" 

The hopes, the fears, the strength, the weakness 
of the Confederacy find proper consideration, 
and again the reader feels that he is learning 
of things as they were at the time, that he 
shares the concern of the North or the confi- 
dence of the South, as the fortunes of war vary 
and Mars seems hostile to the Union, until 
Gettysburg and Vicksburg bring rejoicing and

new zeal to the disheartened Northland. Mr. 
Rhodes's story of the critical years of the war 
is certainly a strong one as regards its treatment 
of men in the field and at Washington, its con- 
sideration of administration measures and the 
opposition thereto, its fairness toward the armed 
enemies of the government and to those who 
kept up a " fire in the rear." 

Still another phase of the great conflict re- 
quired treatment : that was its diplomacy, 
notably with England. If one desires to know 
just how the ruling classes and the people of 
that country felt toward the contending sides, 
he need look no further. A good many pages 
are taken up with this discussion, from the time 
when English negligence allowed the "Ala- 
bama" to get to sea, until the leaders were 
forced by the logic of events to give up any 
plans which might have been considered for 
recognition of the Confederacy, as the Emanci- 
pation Proclamation found increasing favor and 
the feeling of sympathy manifested by the 
common people of England for the North grew 
in strength. The story is unfolded naturally, 
and in the proper sequence. The failure of the 
English government to respect our rights is 
plainly apparent, the anxiety of our minister is 
shared, the attitude of English leaders when 
they did a friendly act is indicated, and the 
acknowledgment of wrong and reparation 
made in connection with the Geneva Award 
are urged as reasons for forgiving those who 
as leaders of English thought and life took a 
mistaken position in our day of adversity. 

This fourth volume by Mr. Rhodes is a strong 
one. It is convincing in style, and each im- 
portant conclusion is fortified by abundant 
reference in the form of foot-notes and quota- 
tions. The wealth of this illustrative mate- 
rial is partly indicated by the statement that 
only fifteen of the five hundred and thirty- 
nine pages of the text are without some sort 
of supplementary reference or helpful quo- 
tation. In some cases the notes discuss mat- 
ters not taken up in the text proper because 
of lack of space for the more extended treat- 
ment. Twelve maps supply the needed geo- 
graphical help. 

There are some matters of detail which might 
be criticised ; but taken as a whole, as a vol- 
ume in a series, and as a sober presentation of 
facts about a period of great excitement and 
passion, Mr. Rhodes's latest contribution to 
American history is notable. 

FRANCIS WAYLAND SHEPARDSON. 



IBSEX AND BJORNSON.* 



At three different dates (1866, 1882, and 
1898), Dr. Georg Brandos has endeavored to 
interpret, for the large public which his writ- 
ings reach, the significance of the work of Dr. 
Ibsen. The first study was written just after 
" Brand " and " Peer Gynt " had led the way 
to the wide European fame that their author 
was henceforth to enjoy ; the second appeared 
just after " Ghosts " had fluttered to some pur- 
pose the dovecotes of a conventional society ; 
the third was a recognition of the commanding 
position that the great Norwegian had won for 
himself at the time of his seventieth birthday. 
These three studies, unrevised, although at 
some points inconsistent with each other in 
their judgments, have been published by the 
author in a single volume, and translated into 
English by Miss Jessie Muir. At the same 
time, Miss Mary Morison has made a transla- 
tion of the essay of Dr. Brandes upon Herr 
Bjornson, which was originally published with 
the second of the three studies above mentioned 
in the volume entitled " Moderne Gjennem- 
brudsmaend." The four essays thus described 
have been brought together in a volume to 
which Mr. William Archer has given editorial 
supervision, and for which he has written an 
introduction. The first and third of the papers 
devoted to Dr. Ibsen are now for the first time 
put into English ; the second, together with the 
paper upon Herr Bjbrnson, may be found m the 
volume called " Men of the Modern Awaken- 
ing," being a selection from several collections 
of critical essays by Dr. Braudes, translated by 
Professor Rasmus B. Anderson, and published 
in this country thirteen years ago. 

The three essays upon Dr. Ibsen offer an 
extremely interesting study in critical method. 
They are " a running commentary on Ibsen's 
spiritual development," made by the most com- 
petent among living critics for such a task. The 
author, to quote from Mr. Archer's introduction, 
" Approached the study of the poet's works with a 
perfectly free mind, neither overawed by a great ready- 
made reputation, nor warped into antagonism by secta- 
rian mispraise. His criticism throughout is absolutely 
candid. In the ' first impression,' indeed, it is so largely 
unfavorable that the fact of their subsequent intimate 
friendship speaks volumes for the character of both 
men. ... It is no eulogy of Ibsen that is here pre- 
sented to the English-speaking public. Some admirers 
of the poet may think the critic, at points, over- severe 
and perhaps even captious. Let them remember that 
absolute sincerity is of more importance than absolute

correctness, even if correctness ' could fitly be predi- 
cated of any aesthetic judgment." 

As for Dr. Brandes himself, he writes of his 
three studies in the following terms : 

" It is well-known that Henrik Ibsen completed his 
seventieth year on the 20th March, 1898. I have, in 
commemoration of this anniversary, combined my first 
and second essays upon him with a third, which brings 
my account of his poetic labours down to our own 
day. Those who, in foreign countries, have discussed 
Henrik Ibsen's poetic career, have, as a rule, been able 
to make a general survey of it before they wrote. . . . 
They have had the whole fabric of his life-work before 
them, and have deduced from it, as it were, a more or 
less correct picture of the master-builder. It may at 
some future time be interesting to see how the building 
was reflected in the mind of a contemporary who saw 
it come into being, and who, at a comparatively early 
time, was so situated as to be able from his impressions 
of the master-builder's personality, to say a few words 
of guidance to students of his work." 

Evidences of a progressive broadening of out- 
look and enlightenment of view are frequent in 
these studies. Take, for example, the familiar 
attribution of pessimism to Dr. Ibsen's think- 
ing. In the first study, we read : 

" Whatever the merits or defects of his productions, 
it is clear that we have here to deal with a poet who 
looks upon the life of the present day with the eye of a 
pessimist. . . . His gloomy way of looking at things 
makes him, in the first place, polemical; for when he 
directs his gaze towards his own time, it presents to his 
eye sheer misery and guilt, and shows him the discord 
between what ought to be and what is. In the second 
place, it makes him bitter; for when he turns his gaze 
on the ideal, he sees its destruction as inevitable, all 
higher living and striving as fruitless, and discord be- 
tween what ought to be, and what is, attainable." 

Now this judgment, be it remembered, was 
rendered in the face of " Brand," whose teach- 
ing gives it the lie direct. If that great poem 
means anything, it means that the triumph of 
the ideal, not its destruction, is inevitable, and 
that what ought to be attainable may really 
become so if a few leaders of men will only 
eschew, like Brand, all dealings with the ac- 
cursed spirit of compromise. " Brand " is, in 
its essence, one of the most hopeful poems ever 
written. In the second study, Dr. Brandes has 
come to this saner view. 

"Sceptical as he [Ibsen] is, he does not actually 
doubt the possibility of happiness. . . . When he touches 
a social sore, as in ' The Pillars of Society,' and else- 
where, it is always one of a moral nature. Some one 
is to blame for it. Whole strata of society are rotten, 
whole rows of society's pillars are decayed and hollow. 
The close air of the small community is unhealthy; in 
wide spheres there is room for great actions. A breath 
from without, that is to say a breath of the spirit of 
truth and liberty, has power to purify the atmosphere. 
. . . His pessimism is not of a metaphysical, but of a 
moral nature, and is based on a conviction of the possi- 



bility of realizing ideals; it is, in a word, the pessimism 
of indignation." 

But this is not pessimism at all ; and the critic, 
rejecting the substance, should have rejected 
the term itself. Dr. Ibsen's mission has been 
that of the physician, to touch, like Goethe, the 
weak spots of the social organism, saying, " thou 
ailest here, and here," and to indicate the ways 
in which health may be restored. 

The preeminence of " Brand " among the 
works of Dr. Ibsen is as marked as that of 
" Faust " among the works of Goethe, and the 
interest of any thoroughgoing discussion of the 
author must centre in his treatment of that 
difficult masterpiece. Unfortunately, the dis- 
cussion of " Brand " is found chiefly in the first, 
and consequently the least mature, of these 
three essays, and the result is disappointing. 
We are told that the author 

" Is wholly and utterly carried away by his hero, whose 
one-sidedness it is, after all, his purpose to condemn. 
Ibsen has conjured up a spirit that he himself is power- 
less to control. . . . The last words of the poem carry 
with them no conviction; for Brand has beaten every 
objection out of the field, and has already admirably 
refuted the charge which meets him at the moment of 
his death, the charge of not having understood that God 
is love." 

This closing scene has indeed been a stumbling- 
block to the commentators, for it seems at first 
sight to mean that Brand has been mistaken 
all along, and that his sufferings and sacrifices 
have been needless. But the evident sincerity 
and sympathy with which he has been por- 
trayed up to this point makes the conclusion 
seem stultifying, and leaves the reader sorely 
perplexed. Now, the explanation of this eth- 
ical antinomy is to be found in the philosophy 
of Sbren Kierkegaard, and Dr. Brandes, who 
has made a special study of this Danish theolo- 
gian, and who repeatedly refers to his influence 
over the poet, should have discovered the ex- 
planation. But that discovery has been left 
for an Englishman, Mr. M. A. Stobart, who, 
in the August " Fortnightly Keview," clears 
away the difficulty in the most triumphant man- 
ner. A more illuminating piece of criticism 
it has not often been our fortune to read. The 
following is the significant passage of the dis- 
cussion, arrived at after the life of Brand has 
been brought down to its closing episode : 

" He has recognized and now finally vanquished the 
Spirit of Compromise which latter is the tocsin 
drummed by Kierkegaard's philosophy and annihi- 
lated his human Will. The struggle has been to the 
death, but he is victor. Surely the quantum satis of his 
Will has merited the redemption he has set himself 
to win for his race ? But it is only now, when his 



316 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



Will has finally trampled on the last traces of human 
weakness, and he has definitely chosen his ' All or 
Nothing ' in preference to the tempter's suggestions of 
earthly happiness with wife and child, that Brand's 
conquest is complete. So, it is only now, that, accord- 
ing to Kierkegaard, he may expect to find the love, the 
mercy of his Creator. And it is only, therefore, at this, 
the last moment of his worldly existence, as he sinks 
before the rushing avalanche, that the answer to the 
desperate prayer of his whole life is vouchsafed to him, 
and, through the roaring thunder-cloud, the message 
there is no mistaking is proclaimed: the quantum satis 
of his Will has merited Redemption, and Brand knows 
that now, at last for him God is Dem caritatit I " 

The views of Dr. Brandes, as he takes up 
one play after another, and proceeds to examine 
it in the dry light of true philosophical intelli- 
gence, are always interesting, and in many 
instances informing as well. But we cannot 
escape the feeling that many vital things have 
somehow eluded the critic's vision, and the 
reader capable of understanding Ibsen at all, 
who should first approach him through the 
medium of this work, would find a great deal 
more than he had been led to expect. Miss 
Elizabeth Robins, writing in an English review 
upon this very book, expresses our meaning 
perfectly when she says : 

" I realise now that if I had waited for Dr. Brandes 
to introduce the great Norwegian to me, I should not 
have pursued my new acquaintance far. I should have 
heard too much of Ibsen's idiosyncracy, and not enough 
of his fascination. I should have been warned that the 
poem of " Brand," the great spiritual drama which had 
made my heart beat and the tears come, was borrowed 
from Kierkegaard, and hardly worth the borrowing." 

We think Miss Robins over-harsh in the passage 
that comes soon afterwards, but it represents a 
point of view that must not be ignored in any 
discussion of the book before us. She says : 

M One turns away from these bald and doctrinaire 
1 Impressions ' with a sense that there may be an ad- 
vantage in approaching a great poet without the assist- 
ance of ' a critical intelligence of the first order.' One 
recalls with a flush of gratitude the quick uplifting that 
came of personal contact with the plays that Dr. Brandes 
sets himself to dissect. The critic gives no smallest 
hint, to my sense, of the flashing vitality, the bitter wit, 
the tenderness so deep and innig that it moves one first 
to tears and then to feel all tears should be straightway 
dried in a world where such infinite gentleness had 
found a voice. If it depended on Dr. Brandes, few 
would guess that the plays were more than philosophic 
discussions upon social life." 

These words, in our opinion, show a deeper 
insight into the poet's mind than any that 
Dr. Brandes accomplished critic and scholar 
though he be has written upon the subject. 
We are inclined to think it was a mistake to 
add the Bjb'rnson essay to this volume. For 
one thing, it was already accessible in English, 



and for another, it is incomplete and inadequate, 
suggesting an appendix instead of a companion 
study. The most fitting words that Dr. Brandes 
has written about the relations of his two sub- 
jects occur at the close of the second Ibsen 
study. 

< It seems to me that Bjornson and Ibsen may be 
compared to the two old Norwegian kings, Sigurd and 
Eystein, who, in the famous legendary conversation 
appropriated by Bjornson in ' Sigurd Jorsalfar,' boast to 
each other of their merits. The one has stayed at home 
and civilized his country, the other has left it, wandered 
far and wide, and gained honour for it on his wild and 
arduous journeying*. Each has his admirers, each his 
contentious band of followers, who exalt the one at the 
expense of the other. But they are brothers, although 
they have for a time been at variance; and the only 
right thing to happen and it does happen at the end 
of the play is the peaceable division of the kingdom 
between them." 

These are fair and true words, truer than their 
author now thinks them, since he is at pains to 
take them back when he comes to his third 
estimate of Dr. Ibsen. It would have been 
better to leave Eystein-Bjbrnson out of this 
book altogether than to deal with him as a 
writer of secondary importance. We are by 
no means sure that, when the final critical ac- 
count is made up at some time in the twentieth 
century, his fame will not shine even more re- 
splendent than that of his great contemporary.

sive travels by the Governor over his vast province, 
and is a mine of recent information on the country, 
population, and industries, containing also histor- 
ical notes of value. The author evidently has at 
heart the well-being and development of northern 
Russia, and works to this end with enlightened 
energy. Further, there is evidence in this volume 
of a kindly consideration and a genial humor, qual- 
ities which are popularly supposed to be lacking in 
a Russian governor. The following example may 
be quoted : 

" Our solicitude for the Samoyedes of Novaia Zemlia 
extended even to such details as the following. The 
settlers included a brother and sister, both grown up, 
and, in answer to the usual queries as to what articles 
they were in need of, the one requested, among other 
things, a wife, and the other a husband. As these were 
not forthcoming, with the consent of their parents we 
brought out with us a bridegroom and a bride. Each 
having been duly introduced to his or her partner, I 
gave them an hour to become better acquainted with 
each other, after which the weddings were immediately 
to take place. The young Novaia Zemlian Samoyede 
was pleased with the bride we brought him, and she, 
in her turn, with him. . . . But not so with the other. 
The Novaia Zemlian bride would have nothing to do 
with the bridegroom of our choosing. Do you call him 
a Samoyede ? ' she cried. ' He 's never killed a white 
bear ! Why, my little brother, who 's only twelve years 
old, has killed several, and I myself even have shot 
over a score of wild deer. And what has he been do- 
ing ? Killing tame reindeer ! No, I wo n't have him ! ' 
And she was as good as her word, the more we tried to 
persuade her, the more she insisted ; nothing we could 
urge could prevail on her to have him, so our match- 
making was not altogether a success. The unlucky 
bridegroom non-elect could only pull a long face and 
retire ! " 

This volume well illustrates in many details the 
paternal methods by which Russia has been so suc- 
cessful in dealing with inferior alien races. There 
are a number of interesting notes on natural his- 
tory ; but we should like better evidence than reports 
as to the wild ducks which become so accustomed 
to having their eggs removed by the natives that 
if " an odd duckling or two begin to peep out of 
their shells, the old ones immediately drag them 
forth and hurl them into the water," and also as to 
the kind of shark that " feeds chiefly on human 
flesh." The book contains a number of useful 
maps and illustrations. 

" Holland and the Hollanders," by Mr. David S. 
Meldrum, is an agreeably written description of the 
country and people. The opening chapters are 
given to impressions of the Holland of to-day ; while 
later chapters tell of the government, of the dykes, 
of education, and of the state of affairs in the sev- 
eral provinces. One of our author's impressions is 
that "Too much is made of the Dutch rage for 
cleanliness. The village of Broek, to which the 
tourist is sent flying by the guides, to see this na- 
tional virtue in its most ridiculous exhibitions, is a 
standing joke among the Hollanders themselves. 



The explanation of all this scrubbing and polishing 
and painting, as of almost all the characteristics of 
the Dutch, is the superabundance of water." This 
explanation, it must be granted, he finds only par- 
tial. This work is useful as a popular book, and 
contains a number of interesting illustrations. 

" Tunisia," by Mr. Herbert Vivian, contains the 
impressions acquired by a conservative and some- 
what prejudiced Englishman during a brief sojourn 
in that Barbary State. Mr. Vivian has very little 
that is good to say of the French in Tunis, as is 
rather vividly intimated by his secondary title, " and 
the Modern Barbary Pirates." He thinks that 
" the administration of Tunisia is as rotten as that 
of the French Republic." As we are inclined to 
suspect the fairness of the book in some respects, so 
also the information is sometimes suspicions, as when 
he declares that " the Arabs have a curious charac- 
teristic in common with horses and many other ani- 
mals. They prefer stagnant water, however disgust- 
ing in smell and appearance, to the most limpid 
running water." So also he informs us that it is a cus- 
tom in the American army to bury all mules who fall 
in battle with military honors. However, the author 
gives many pleasant descriptions of the land and of 
the people Moslems, Jews, and " niggers " as 
in this of the street story-teller : 

" First he collected his audience in a circle around 
him by much banging of his tambourine. Then he pro- 
ceeded to spin the most marvellous yarns, only stopping 
to collect pennies when he reached a climax of excite- 
ment, and perceived that his hearers were burning to 
know what happened next to the princess, or the Jinn, 
or the enchanted casket. He reminded me of the sen- 
sational magazines, which always take care to close the 
instalments of their serials at the most breathless situ- 
ations. When he had collected as much as he fancied 
would be volunteered by his hearers, he would count up 
the total and announce that he must have so many more 
pence before revealing another syllable of the story. 
He was generally as good as his word, and it was the 
most inquisitive part of his audience which had to pay." 

While this work is far from being impartial or thor- 
oughgoing, it is readable and fresh, and the many 
photographic illustrations add to the interest. 

Mr. Charles Dana Gibson, in his "Sketches in 
Egypt," gives us in breezy style by pen and pencil 
his impressions of Cairo and the usual tourist trip 
up the Nile to the first cataract. The brief text is 
written in a light, airy vein, often approaching the 
flippant ; but, of course, the illustrations are the 
chief excuse for the volume. We confess that Mr. 
Gibson does not seem to us at his happiest here. 
Occasionally, as on pages 9, 22, 94, the drawings 
show his best characteristic touch ; but in the main 
they are rather weak and flat, and often made 
worse by poor printing. 

Mr. Charles Neufeld's " A Prisoner of the Kha- 
leefa " is a companion book to Slatin's " Fire and 
Sveord in the Soudan," being a narrative of capture, 
imprisonment, and slavery among the Mahdists. 
But it suffers in comparison with Mr. Slatin's work, 



318 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



for it is quite lacking in picturesquenest and breadth 
of view, and in all qualities of style ; and, besides, 
it is too summary, and too much a mere personal 
vindication, to be of the highest interest and value. 
Yet the rather bald and brief account of each re- 
markable experiences among so remarkable a peo- 
ple cannot fail to be of considerable interest and 
value. Certainly, whenever the author forgets him- 
self, and speaks in some objective way of the native 
and his surroundings, he can be both entertaining 
and instructive, as, for example, in his description 
of the arrangement of marriages between prisoners 
and jailers. The ferocity, mendacity, avarice and 
cruelty of the MahdisU are drawn in even blacker 
lines than by Mr. Slatin. Mr. Nenfeld was in irons 
for practically the whole time of his captivity. 

" For ten years I had been so chained and weighted 
with iron that it was only with effort I was able to 
raise my feet from the ground in order to shuffle from 
place to place; the bars of iron connected with the 
anklets had limited the stride or shuffle to about ten or 
twelve inches. ' When freed from all this, I ran and 
jumped about the whole day long like one possessed; 
but the sudden call upon the muscles so long unused 
resulted in a swelling of the legs from hips to ankles, 
and this was accompanied with most excruciating pains." 

No doubt many of Neofeld's extraordinary hard- 
ships were due to wrong-headedness and hot-head- 
edness, as, indeed, he sometimes acknowledges. 
The author had much to do with the natives in a 
medical way, and thus notes their insensibility to 
pain, apropos of extracting a bullet from the arm 
of a Soudanese with a penknife : 

"Maybe, with a European, chloroform might have 
been necessary for the extraction of the bullet in the 
arm; but with a Soudanese have I not already said 
that a dervish can continue leaping and stabbing with 
half a dozen severe wounds in his body ? A dervish can 
and will kill at the moment when the ventricles of his 
heart make their last contraction. Bodily pain, as we 
understand it, is unknown to them. Many a time have 
I applied, and seen applied, red-hot charcoal to sores, 
with the patients calmly looking on." 

Mr. Neufeld believes it was a mistake to grant any 
quarter to wounded dervishes. The book has a 
number of useful illustrations, maps, sketches, and 
appendices. 

" Enchanted India," by Prince Karageorgevitch, 
is a series of slight artistic sketches, or literary 
etchings, descriptive of the native life in the great 
centres of India. As an example, we may instance 
this sketch of native soldiery : 

" Some native lancers were manoeuvring; they charged 
at top speed in a swirl of golden dust, which transfig- 
ured their movements, making them look as though 
they did not touch the earth, but were riding on the 
clouds. They swept lightly past, almost diaphanous, 
the colour of their yellow khaki uniforms mingling with 
the ochre sand ; and then, not ten yards off, they stopped 
short, with astonishing precision, like an apparition. 
Their lances quivered for an instant, a flash of steel 
sparks against the sky a salute to the Maharajah 
and then they were as motionless as statues." 



Another book on India, of quite a different type, 
is " From the Himalayas to the Equator," by Bishop 
Cyrus Foss. This is an account of the Bishop's 
recent missionary tour in India and Malaysia, and 
is Jn the form of letters of travel. It in illustrated 
from photographs, and will be of special interest to 
missionary circles. 

Mr. M. M. Shoemaker's "Quaint Corners of 
Ancient Empires " is a series of brief sketchy chap- 
ters made by the quick-passing traveller in Southern 
India, Burma, and Manila. It hardly deserves its 
title, save, perhaps, in the case of the chapter on 
Rameswaram, " the most venerated, the most mag- 
nificent, and the largest of Hindoo temples, situated 
on a lonely sandy island close under the shores of 
Southern India." One corridor of this temple he 
describes as a thousand feet long. In fact, all 
the shrines of the world shrink into insignificance 
as one stands gazing down the vast spaces of Rames- 
waram." He has much also to say of the temples 
of Burma. The author was in Manila in January 
of this year, but his observations of this region are 
of the slightest. While this work is hasty and su- 
perficial, it is fairly readable, and the illustrations 
are of some interest 

" Intimate China," by Mrs. Archibald Little, ia 
a large, finely manufactured and illustrated book, 
which fairly justifies its title, as being a close study 
based on long and varied experience. The author 
is well acquainted with Pekin, and has made sev- 
eral tours in far western China, even being so ad- 
venturous as to penetrate into Chinese Tibet. Very 
vivid and interesting are her sketches of crowded 
city life, as in her note on the 

" All-pervading babble, row I had almost called it, of 
the boys in the schools, here, there, and everywhere, so 
that it is almost impossible to get out of earshot of 
'them, all at the top of their boy voices shouting out the 
classics, as they painstakingly day after day and year 
after year commit them to memory. With the sickly 
sweet smell of the opium, and to the sound of the vast 
ear-drum-splitting army of China's schoolboys, all must 
forever associate life in a Chinese city." 

So, again, she notes her plan for subduing the crowds 
that annoyed her : 

"So I tried my old plan, the only one I have ever 
found effectual with a Chinese crowd, and, getting out 
of the chair, standing quite still, looked solemnly and 
sadly at first one, then another, till he wished the ground 
would cover him and retired. I fancy glasses heighten 
the effect. Anyway, they all sat down, each hiding 
behind the other as far as he could." 

Mrs. Little writes throughout in a very open-minded, 
fair and sympathetic way, and the book is to be 
cordially recommended both for information and 
entertainment. 

" Hawaiian America," by Mr. Caspar Whitney, 
is a good general account of the Hawaii of to-day 
with some notice of the Hawaii of yesterday. Mr. 
Whitney regards Hawaii as the only one of our 
possessions 
" Likely to become an American community. Here i

no such problem such as awaits us in the Philippines, or 
in Puerto Rico, or even in Cuba. No wrenching of 
local law or upheaval of native custom attended the 
annexation of Hawaii. Here was a country with an 
established government uncorrupted ; a people, the 
richest per capita in the world, and with a percentage of 
illiteracy lower than that of any European nation, save 
perhaps Prussia, and lower than in many of our own 
States; a land capable of producing the majority of the 
products of the temperate and tropical zones ; a country 
largely Americanized and wholly Christianized." 

The work is fully illustrated from photographs, and 
is well provided with maps, making a very useful 
sketch of the Islands. 

"Twelve Months in Klondike," by Mr. R. C. 
Kirk, is a simple graphic sketch by a newspaper 
correspondent who went through to Dawson by way 
of the Chilcoot Pass in the fall of 1897. The photo- 
graphic illustrations are exceptionally clear.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Methods and The first volume of an important 

materials of work that will be welcome to all stu- 

literary criticism. dent8 Q { literature has just been pub- 
lished. The work is a product of the joint schol- 
arship of Professors Charles Mills Gayley and Fred 
Newton Scott, and is entitled " An Introduction to 
the Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism " 
(Ginn). The sub-title of the present volume is 
" The Bases in ^Esthetics and Poetics." A second 
volume dealing with " Literary Types " will com- 
plete the work. Literary criticism, say the authors, 
has now " outgrown the stage of unquestioning ac- 
quiescence in tradition, authority, personal bias or 
prejudice. But it is not yet fully alive to its possi- 
bilities, scope, or aim, not organized." An attempt 
at such organization is what this work offers us. 
" The objects more directly aimed at in this volume, 
and that which will shortly follow it, are, first, to 
give the reader his orientation by showing the rela- 
tions of literature to art, criticism, aesthetics, and 
the contributory sciences, and by displaying the 
solidarity and scope of literature ; second, to con- 
sider the main types or forms which literature has 
assumed in the course of its development ; third, to 
trace the movement and determine the law of liter- 
ary waves or fashions ; and last, to deduce from 
these considerations the principles which should 
guide us in critically estimating given literary pro- 
ducts." Of this ambitious programme, only the 
" orientation " is dealt with in the present volume. 
Each of its seven chapters embraces (1 ) a discus- 
sion of such problems as the topic in hand presents 
for consideration, (2) a comprehensive bibliography, 
with critical commentary on each important refer- 
ence, (3) suggestions for special investigation. The 
chapters have for their several subjects the " Nature 
and Function of Literary Criticism," the " Princi- 
ples of Literature," " The Theory of Poetry," 



" The Historical Study of Poetics," and " The Prin- 
ciples of Versification." The authors add this note 
to the exposition of their plan : " While the work 
is not intended to set forth any special system or 
criticism, being rather a clue to the sources which 
will acquaint the student with any or all systems, 
yet some pains has been taken to distinguish, in the 
commentary, those theories which are thought to 
rest upon a sound scientific and aesthetic basis." 
The result of all this industry is not, indeed, a book 
to be read, but a book to be used as a guide through 
the labyrinth of critical literature ; and in this re- 
spect the bibliographical sections are by far the most 
important, being prepared with great thoroughness, 
and embracing classified references to the most im- 
portant work to be found in all the culture-lan- 
guages. As has already been observed, the aim of 
the work is mainly that of guidance and suggestion 
rather than of elaborating a critical system ; but we 
should supplement this statement by saying that the 
modern scientific or evolutionary treatment of liter- 
ature is the underlying principle of the whole dis- 
cussion, a fact which comes out clearly in the section 
dealing with " Comparative Literature." We are 
bound to compliment the authors of this volume 
upon their scholarship and their fairness in present- 
ing contrasted opinions, and to thank them most 
heartily for placing in our hands a manual of the 
subject that goes far beyond anything hitherto 
attempted in English, and that is simply invaluable 
for purposes of reference. 

M. Imbert de Saint- Amand's latest 
volume, France and Italy" (Scrib- 
ner), deals with that annus mirabi- 
lis of modern Italian history, 1859, the year of 
Louis Napoleon's " Sardinian adventure " (a games- 
ter's throw, we should say, rather than a quixotic- 
ally generous enterprise in political knight-errantry), 
with its tragic episodes of Magenta and Solferino, 
and its, for Sardinia and Cavour, somewhat abor- 
tive issue at Villafranca. In his curious and very 
characteristic foreword (characteristically French, 
we mean), M. Saint-Amand calls upon his country- 
men to contemplate the triumphs of that " swift and 
joyous " (!) war of 1859, and to seek in its memo- 
ries a lenitive for those of 1870. "Our misfortunes," 
he philosophically says, " occupy our minds too 
much ; we do not think enough about our glories. 
Hypnotized by the memory of our disasters, we lose 
sight of triumphs, the record of which is, neverthe- 
less, preeminently adapted to fortify the military 
sentiment which is the hope and consolation of 
France." One would think that the obviously wise 
thing for France to do now, in view of the evil and 
humiliation which that same " military sentiment " 
has brought upon her, would be to weaken and sup- 
plant it, rather than to fortify it, and to find " hope 
and consolation," not in the prospect of a bloody 
revanche upon the power she wantonly provoked 
beyond endurance in 1870, but in that of a national 
future serene in the substantial blessings of wide-

spread prosperity and well-being, and illustrious in 
those higher arts of peace and civilization which she 
has already done so much to heighten and adorn. 
How much better to contemplate a future like that 
painted by Condorcet, the noblest victim of the 
Revolution, than one which shall repeat the specious 
glories of Napoleonic days ! Is not the Napoleonic 
legend, for France, a Upas tree, rooted in a soil that 
was fattened with the blood of a sturdy and virile 
generation of her sons whose untimely cutting off 
is the secret of her admitted physical degeneracy 
to-day ? Further, if France's ideal and summmn 
bonum of aspiration must still be, as M. Saint- 
Amand quietly assumes, military glory, is there not 
just now clearly a more practical and necessary busi- 
ness for her to look to than the mere feeding of her 
imagination on the memories of Magenta and Sol- 
f erino ? What of the present condition of the instru- 
ment by which future Magentas and Solferinos are 
to be won ? The achievements of an army officered 
largely by such men as stood the other day in the 
pillory at Rennes will hardly be of a nature to erase 
the recollections and heal the smarts of Sedan. 
M. Saint-Amand is a swift, brilliant, and sympa- 
thetic narrator, a capital painter of historical pic- 
tures, a shrewd judge of men and motives ; and the 
present volume is one of the best of the popular 
series of historical studies which has made his name 
a familiar one to American readers. M. Saint- 
Amand is particularly happy in his citations from 
the authorities, and his books are a veritable mine 
in that sort. The great diplomatic and military 
events of 1859 are nowhere more brilliantly and en- 
tertainingly if slightly sketched than in this volume. 
The illustrations comprise portraits of Victor Em- 
manuel, MacMahon, Francis Joseph, and Cavour.

vals, and whose thought is allowed to ripen before 
it takes the garb of print. When he does speak, 
whether in verse or prose, we know that he is giv- 
ing us of his best, and that best has a quality too 
rarely met with in this age of hurried and voluble 
speech. The four papers to which " Heart of 
Man " (Macmillan) is given as a collective title are 
seemingly diverse in their themes the first a 
descriptive and historical essay on "Taormina," 
another, " A New Defence of Poetry," another a 
disquisition upon " Democracy," and the last, " The 
Ride," a collection of philosophical jottings from a 
thinker's note-book. " The intention of the author 
was to illustrate how poetry, politics, and religion 
are the flowering of the same human spirit, and 
have their feeding roots in a common soil, ' deep in 
the general heart of men.' " It is in this sense, and in 
the common possession of that high seriousness which 
is so greatly needed in literature, that these essays 
have claim to unity ; this we feel more and more as 
the impression of their fine idealism becomes deep- 
ened page by page. Here is a writer with the 



firmest of faith in the things of the spirit, to whom 
poetry is as the bread of life, to whom democracy 
is the earthly hope of men," to whom religion is 
no mere affair of observance but the name which we 
give to the most sacred aspirations of the soul. And 
the writer's message upon these high matters is 
delivered in a style of such exquisite simplicity, such 
grateful cadence, such finished art, that we take 
new hope for the nation that can still raise up such 
voices to express its nobler moods. The message, 
to quote the author's own words, is " blended of 
many voices of the poets whom Shelley called, 
whatever might be their calamity on earth, the most 
fortunate of men ; it rises from all lands, all ages, 
all religions ; it is the battle-cry of that one great 
idea whose slow and hesitating growth is the un- 
folding of our long civilization, seeking to realize in 
democracy the earthly, and in Christianity the 
heavenly, hope of men, the idea of the commu- 
nity of the soul, the sameness of it in all men." It 
seems a pity to descend to minute criticism of a 
volume so deserving of praise, but we must note two 
minor slips, one made in quoting " the rack of this 
tough world," which memory tricked the writer 
into calling this rude world." and one made in 
attributing the discovery of Uranus to Leverrier 
instead of to Herschel. What is really meant is 
the discovery of Neptune by Leverrier and Adams. 

By the translation of two of the 
earlier plays of M. Rostand, our 
reading public has a chance to esti- 
mate more fully than it could hitherto the power of 
the author of " Cyrano de Bergerac." " Les Ro- 
manesques " is translated by Mips Mary Hendee 
under the title "The Romancers" (Doubleday); 
"La Princesse Lointaine " is translated by Mr. 
Charles Renauld (Stokes). We think that, con- 
trary to the usual expectation in such cases, these 
earlier works will add to the reputation of their 
author. Not that they are as fine plays as M. 
Rostand's famous masterpiece, but each is in its 
own way so very good that we gain from them a 
higher opinion of their author. " Les Romanesques" 
is, and was intended to be, no more than a charm- 
ing trifle, whimsical, original, poetic. It tones more 
than the other in the translation, perhaps necessa- 
rily ; but what is left has a quality, a poetic charac- 
ter, in which we find an echo, or really a premoni- 
tion, of the contagions exuberance which sometimes 
breaks out in the Gascon hero of the later play. 
" La Princesse Lointaine," however, is more than 
charming : it has real beauty. It is by no meant 
surprising that M. Coquelin, when he heard it read, 
had the confidence in the author which called forth 
"Cyrano de Bergerac." It has the same charac- 
teristic : it is a real, a serious idea, etherealized into 
a delicate poetic form. The play has not, we should 
say, the power of construction of M. Rostand's 
masterpiece, but this note of reality in all the ex- 
travagance of romance it does have. It may re- 
mind one of "Tristan nnd Isolde" some of the

circumstances, some of the motives are the same 
and if so, the striking power of M. Rostand will 
probably appear. In " Tristan " we have an ideali- 
zation of passion than which it would seem nothing 
could go further. In the "Princesse," however, 
we have an embodied apprehension of the real mo- 
tive power of life (in the romancer's ethic), which 
appears to be something better. The play is not 
dramatically so strong as " Tristan," for it is not 
so ably thought out or put into form : it seems to 
us to fall off a little toward the end. But in it M. 
Rostand grasped an idea, an idea which enabled 
him to see the things he makes us see in " Cyrano 
de Bergerac." The two translations are good, but 
not remarkable ; that of " La Princesse Lointaine" 
seems the better, but both can be read with pleas- 
ure. We should now like to see a translation of 
" La Samaritaine." 



" Fisherman's 
Luck " and 
other stories. 



The right flavor of the essay, as a 
specific form of composition, pleas- 
antly prevades most of the dozen 
charming papers contained in Dr. Henry Van Dyke's 
"Fisherman's Luck" (Scribner). The initial pa- 
per gives title to the volume. Other titles are " The 
Thrilling Moment," " Taxability," "A Wild Straw- 
berry," " Fishing in Books," "A Lazy, Idle Brook," 
"A Norwegian Honeymoon," "A Fatal Success," 
etc. Dr. Van Dyke, naturally, has his say on 
Walton ; and here, let us add, it occurs to us that 
if any one of our writers deserves to be dubbed " the 
American Walton " it is the Doctor. The pisca- 
torial habit he has in the due degree; and there is 
more than a little of the peculiar Waltonian charm 
of freshness and gayety the unaffected joy in 
the things of nature that form the setting, the 
sweet and wholesome environment, of the angler's 
pursuit, in bis pages. Dr. Van Dyke finds that only 
two writers have spoken ill of Walton : the envious 
imitator Franck, and Lord Byron. But there was 
a third detractor, a very savage one, Leigh Hunt, 
who inveighed against Izaak's cruelty to the fish 
and, he might have added, to the creatures he used 
as bait. And certainly some of Piscator's direc- 
tions to his "loving scholar " as to the proper mode 
of impaling frogs and worms and minnows, so as to 
keep them writhing in torture on the hook and hence 
enticing to the fish, are, when broadly and unpisca- 
torially viewed, rather shocking. Once he posi- 
tively jests over the process. Telling how to put 
a frog on the hook, he ironically adds, " and in so 
doing, use him as though you loved him, that is, 
harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may 
live the longer" Whereat Hunt is moved to say : 
"Now fancy a Genius fishing for us. Fancy him 
baiting a great hook with pickled salmon, and 
twitching up old Izaak Walton from the banks of 
the river Lea, with the hook through his ear. How 
he would go up, roaring and screaming, and thinking 
the devil had got him ! " But these are unpleasant 
reflections for the angler, who, however contem- 
plative a man he may be, can hardly in the nature 



of things go over to the fishes' point of view and re- 
main an angler. Dr. Van Dyke's book is written in 
his pleasantest and most characteristic vein, and is 
sure of its welcome. The publishers have given it a 
comely setting, the illustrations forming a tempting 
feature of the work. 



Dr. Norman Bridge's little book on 
"The Penalties of Taste" (H. S. 
Stone & Co.) is one that does not 
give a very clear account of itself, so far, at least, 
as the title is concerned. It consists of six essays, 
and is named from the first of them. But this first 
essay, although quite characteristic in tendency and 
treatment, is not as obviously so in title. We 
incline to think that had the book been called " The 
Nerves of the Modern Child " it would have given 
a better idea of itself ; namely, that it is a collection 
of studies on some aspects of modern life by one who 
looks at the question chiefly (and with good right) 
from the standpoint of modern psychology and neu- 
rology. Such, at any rate, the book is : six essays, 
on the two subjects named, and on Bashfulness, 
Heredity, Conscience, and Education, or, more 
exactly, on some aspects of these topics. It is a 
very suggestive volume ; we have read it with 
interest, and recommend it to anyone who is study- 
ing current human nature. We find one matter, 
however, to note : namely, a certain lack of coor- 
dination between writer and reader. The writer, 
for instance, has in mind the commonplaces of 
modern physiology, but he does not seem to remem- 
ber that most readers have not ; on the other hand, 
he has not in mind a good deal of reading which 
readers nowadays are likely enough to have. Thus, 
Dr. Bridge assumes an acquaintance with the cell- 
theory : the average reader knows that there are 
such things as cells, but has very little exact knowl- 
edge of them and therefore does not realise allu- 
sions. On the other hand, Dr. Bridge writes of the 
" collective conscience," without any reference to 
previous speculation on the matter ; but, probably, 
everyone now has read, in some more or less popu- 
larized form, of the " psychology of the crowd." 
For the reason, then, that one has oneself to do 
most of the coordination with previous ideas, these 
essays are a little hard to read, unless one is con- 
tent to get from them the temporary stimulus that 
always comes from the working of an original mind 
turned upon interesting subjects. 

The special features of the attractive 
newr edition, in two moderate sized 
volumes, of " The Reminiscences and 
Recollections of Captain Gronow " (Scribner's im- 
portation) are the full indices to each volume, and 
the 32 illustrations copied and adapted from con- 
temporary sources by Mr. Joseph Grego. Mr. 
Grego's pictures add decidedly to the piquancy and 
graphic quality of the book. There is no need now 
to dwell at length on Gronow. His business in life 
was, as he and his kind phrase it, to " know every- 



322

body and to go everywhere " ; and his book shows 
how even the smallest of God's creatures has its 
serious uses. Dandy, quidnunc, and fashionable 
idler, Gronow had perhaps the largest circle of 
fashionable acquaintance of any man of his time 
in Europe ; and he Boswellized his circle. As some 
men collect china, or prints, or first editions, so 
Gronow collected stories stories illustrative of 
the ways and eccentricities of people talked about 
in the beau monde, from great luminaries like 
Wellington, Byron, Tallyrand, Latnartine, or Peel, 
down to social star-dust or mere eccentrics like 
Brummel and Romeo Coates. Many of the stories 
were Gronow's own ; and he prided himself on pos- 
sessing the correct and authentic versions of certain 
current but warped or exaggerated anecdotes 
Brummel's alleged request to the Prince " to ring 
the bell," for instance, which Gronow, with the air 
and authority of a Grote or a Mommsen, shows to 
have been, like so many accepted accounts of much 
weightier matters, a myth with a tincture of fact. 
Gronow was, beyond compare, the best stocked 
raconteur of his time ; and in a philanthropic mo- 
ment he determined to write a book, to bequeath, 
as it were, to posterity the wonderful store of racy 
personalities and anecdotal bric-ii-brar he had spent 
his life in amassing. This book, one of the most 
entertaining of its kind, and already an instructive 
picture of the manners and morals of the world it 
paints, will grow in a certain historical value as time 
goes on. History could ill spare its Walpoles and 
its Gronows. Too much chaff is undoubtedly min- 
gled with Gronow's grain, but he will continue to 
be read and cited and to wax in authority, in his 
small kind ; and the present edition of him is 
attractive, convenient, and at all points satisfying. 

"A Short History of Free Thought, 
Ancient and Modern " (Macmillan), 
by Mr. John M. Robertson, is a work 
that has no close parallel among previous publica- 
tions, although Lange's " History of Materialism " 
covers a considerable part of the same ground. The 
distinction between the two books is that Lange 
deals especially with general philosophic problems, 
while Mr. Robertson's work has for its subject the 
" revision or rejection of current religious doctrines 
by more or less practical people." Freethought is 
defined by our author as "a conscious reaction 
against some phase or phases of conventional or 
traditional doctrine in religion on the one hand, 
a claim to think freely, in the sense not of disre- 
gard for logic but of special loyalty to it, on prob- 
lems to which the past course of things has given a 
great intellectual and practical importance ; on the 
other hand, the actual practice of such thinking." 
Armed with this definition, the author proceeds to 
survey the history of intellectual endeavor, all the 
way down from primitive man to the latest living 
champions of rationality against superstition. It is 
an inspiring subject, this history of the torch-bearers 
of the intellect, of the secular struggle of truth 



against error ; but the scope of the work is so vast 
that rhetorical adornments have to be suppressed, 
or at best merely indicated, and even then this 
short history " fills a stout volume of nearly five 
hundred pages. It must be confessed that the work 
has a strong bias toward naturalism as against su- 
pernaturalism, and the author sometimes strains a 
point for the purpose of counting some great thinker 
or man of action upon his side. He is also conspic- 
uously unsympathetic in dealing with certain of his 
opponents. But his book is nevertheless a welcome 
contribution to the intellectual history of mankind, 
welcome to the general reader for its perspicuity of 
statement and to the scholar for its industrious mar- 
shallings of facts and references. 

Letkrito So long have we been accustomed 

a friend, to think of Kiiifixiii as henceforth 

among the silent, so long have we 
been in possession of his " Complete Works," that 
it is a delight indeed to greet a new volume from 
his pen " Letters to a Friend " (Houghton). The 
book is but a small one, the letters being few 
only thirty-four in all and many of them very 
short. But they have the true Emersonian ring ; 
almost we would recognize the authorship even if 
published without signature. Here we find the 
8ame gentle optimism, the same inspiring note, as 
in his Essays. For example : " What better sign 
can the good genius of our times show that the old 
creative force is ready to work again, than the uni- 
versal indisposition of the best heads to touch the 
books even of name and fame ? " Or again : " Con- 
cord is a great capital and contemporaneous with 
all the ages." The volume is edited with an intro- 
duction by Professor Charles Eliot Norton. But 
the identity of the " Friend " is not disclosed, and 
we are told little of him except that he was nine 
years the junior of the philosopher, and that he was 
possessed of the practical qualities and the acquaint- 
ance with affairs in which Emerson was deficient 
but which he held in high esteem. Evidently, he 
was one who answered Emerson's own description : 
" A friend is one who makes us do the best we can." 
For certainly, in these private letters, written for 
the eyes of one person only, it is always the serene, 
pure Emerson who speaks, always the spiritual 
meanings of things that are looked for, always the 
same flow of genial polished epigram that we lis- 
tened for so eagerly in the days of long ago.

only a Sir Christopher Wren or a Ruskin could 
enter entirely into its architectural spirit ; only the

revival of English sculpture ; only a thorough his- 
torian or antiquarian could trace all the story of 
the massive building. Yet, though no one person 
combines in himself so numerous and so varied en- 
dowments, he would be stolid indeed who could 
walk through these aisles and transepts and chapels 
without quickened pulse and uplifted spirit. What- 
ever else the visitor in England may forego, it will 
surely not be a journey through this national Wal- 
halla or Temple of Fame. Whoever anticipates 
this experience and what good American does 
not ? should prepare himself by reading the 
charming little book on Westminster Abbey just 
issued by Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & Co., containing 
a sketch of the Abbey by Dean Farrar and a chap- 
ter on " The Poet's Corner " by the late Dean Stan- 
ley. The volume being artistically illustrated as 
well as attractively written, it cannot fail to please 
as well as to inform the reader, whether his interests 
be of the artistic, the scientific, the historical, or 
the antiquarian order.

the Railroad calling or industry, narrated by an 

and Telegraph. ac tual employe or operative proficient 
in its processes and its argot, and seasoned with the 
" romance " of the occupation treated, form the 
basis of a branch of " literature " somewhat in vogue 
just now. Rather favorable specimens of it are 
Mr. John Alexander Hill's "Stories of the Rail- 
road," and Mr. Jasper Ewing Brady's " Tales of 
the Telegraph" (Doubleday and McClure Co.). 
Mr. Hill, who has been a locomotive engineer on 
the Rio Grande Railroad, indulges a thought too 
freely in the sensational and the blood-curdling, 
where he might more profitably have stuck to the 
actual and credible, and always sufficiently moving, 
incidents of his former calling. Like the " fat boy " 
in Pickwick, he " wants to make your flesh creep " ; 
and it is fair to say that he occasionally succeeds in 
doing it. But we advise him, nevertheless, to eschew 
melodrama and cling more closely to the actual in 
future. Mr. Brady is a lively and occasionally 
" slangy " writer, who tells very amusingly the 
checkered story of his rambling career as a tele- 
graph operator. His concluding chapters on his 
experiences at Tampa during the recent war, as a 
Government censor of telegraphic matter, are in- 
teresting, and we should like to see something fur- 
ther from Mr. Brady on this theme. Both books 
are acceptably illustrated. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Three additions have just been made to the series of 
" Scientific Memoirs " published by Messrs. Harper & 
Brothers. " The Laws of Gases," as set forth in the 
memoirs by Robert Boyle and E. H. Amagat, have been 
edited (and the latter translated) by Professor Carl 
Barus. Professor W. F. Magie is the editor and trans- 
lator of the papers devoted to " The Second Law of 
Thermodynamics," by Carnot, Clausius, and Lord Kel- 



vin. " The Fundamental Laws of Electrolytic Conduc- 
tion" have been developed by Faraday, Professor 
Hittorf, and Professor Kohlrausch, and memoirs by 
these men make up the contents of a volume edited by 
Professor H. M. Goodwin. This series is of the utmost 
value to scientific students, and we hope that it will 
come to include many more numbers. 

A package of the recent publications of the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania has just been received. The most 
important of them (which we shall notice later) is a 
bulky monograph upon " The Philadelphia Negro," by 
Dr. W. E. Burghardt DuBois, including also " a special 
report on domestic service," by Miss Isabel Eaton. In 
the astronomical series there is a quarto pamphlet of 
" Results of Observations with the Zenith Telescope of 
the Flower Astronomical Observatory " for two years, 
by Mr. Charles L. Doolittle. A volume of " Contribu- 
tions from the Botanical Laboratory " includes several 
papers and a series of plates. In the philosophical 
series there is an essay " On Spinozistic Immortality," 
by Professor George Stuart Fullerton. Finally, in the 
philological series, there is an edition, by Professor 
Hugo A. Rennert, of the comedy " Ingratitud por 
Amor," by Don Guillen de Castro. 

" Webster's Collegiate Dictionary " (Merriam) is a 
volume of more than a thousand double-columned pages, 
abridged, of course, from the greater " International." 
It has many illustrations. There is one feature pecu- 
liar to this edition in the shape of a glossary of Scottish 
words and phrases designed for the guidance of " kail- 
yard " readers. As one authority remarks, this work 
is " first class in quality and second class in size," which 
epigram may be taken for a sufficient description. 

There be few who may possess the " Golden Legend " 
of Jacobus de Voragine in any of its fifteenth or six- 
teenth century editions, or in the sumptuous reprint of 
the Kelmscott Press. But the pretty little volume of 
" Leaves from the Golden Legend " (Dutton) which has 
just been edited by Mr. H. D. Madge is within the 
reach of the slenderest purses, and suffices to give a 
fair idea of one of the most popular books of the mid- 
dle ages. It is a very dainty booklet, and deserves a 
welcome. 

The Whitaker & Ray Co. of San Francisco send us 
the following three pamphlets : " The Man Who Might 
Have Been," by Mr. Robert Whitaker; "Love and 
Law," by Dr. Thomas P. Bailey; and "California and 
the Californians," by President D. S. Jordan. Such 
hideous covers as enclose these publications we have 
seldom seen; the contents surely deserved more con- 
sideration than this. 

Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's edition of " The Writings 
of Thomas Jefferson" (Putnam) is now completed with 
the publication of the tenth volume. The letters and 
other writings of the closing decade (1816-1826) of 
Jefferson's life are here printed, and the entire work is 
provided with an elaborate index. We congratulate 
Mr. Ford upon this addition to his many solid contri- 
butions to our historical literature. 

" The True Basis of Economics " is a pamphlet de- 
fence of the theories of Henry George, by Dr. J. H. 
Stallard. It takes the form of a lengthy argument by 
Dr. Stallard, with pointed comments by President D. S. 
Jordan. It is hardly necessary to say that Dr. Jordan 
gets the best of the argument, or that his small share 
in the book is far more weighty than the inflated decla- 
mation of his opponent.

is now reissued in a second edition. 

"The Siege of Troye," edited from MS. Harl. 525 by 
Dr. C. H. A. Wager, is an expanded doctoral thesis 
presented to Yale University in 1895. The volume is 
now published by the Macmillan Co. 

A pretty little book of " Aucassin and Nicolette," as 
translated into English verse and prose by Mr. A. Rod- 
ney Macdonough, with illustrations, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Fords, Howard & Hulbert. 

Mr. Charles Herbert Moore's elaborate treatise npon 
the " Development and Character of Gothic Architect- 
ure " has just been republished by the Macmillan Co. 
in a second edition, rewritten and enlarged." 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. publish a new edition (the 
fourth, enlarged) of that very valuable and interesting 
book, "Jerusalem, the City of Herod and Saladin," by 
Sir Walter Besant and the late Professor Palmer. 

The Doubleday & McClure Co. publish a volume of 
" Popular Studies in Literature," dealing with Burns, 
Scott, and Byron. These studies, as edited by Mr. 
Seymour Eaton, were originally published in a Chicago 
newspaper. 

The following are the latest French text-books: 
" Episodes from Le Vicomte de Bragelonne " (Long- 
mans), by Dumas, edited by Mr. F. H. Hewitt; 
"Longmans' Illustrated First Conversational French 
Reader," by Mr. T. H. Bertenshaw; "Benjamine" 
(Longmans), by M. Charles Deslys, edited by M. F. 



Julien; and these three volumes from the American 
Book Co. : "Introductory French Prose Composition," 
by Mr. E. Francois ; Labiche's " La Cigale Chez le 
Fourmis," edited by Mr. T. J. Farrar; and some "Se- 
lected Letters of Madame de Se*vigne*," edited by Mr. 
L. C. Syms. 

Longfellow's " Evangeline," edited by Miss Agnes 
Lathe, and Lowell's "Sir Launfal," edited by Miss 
Ellen A. Viuton, are two additional volumes in the 
" Cambridge Literature Series " of Messrs. B. II. San- 
born & Co. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have published a new 
edition of "The Art of Dining," by the late Abraham 
Hayward. This work was first published in 1852, and 
has had several reissues. In its present form, it has 
certain "annotations and additions" made by Mr. 
Charles Sayle. There is also an excellent portrait of 
the author. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. are to be the American 
publishers of Mr. Swinburne's " Rosamund, Queen of 
the Lombards," and this interesting announcement is 
supplemented by the still more interesting one that the 
same publishers are preparing "a new edition of Swin- 
burne's complete poems, revised and rearranged by the 
author." This news is almost too good to be true. 

On the twenty-fifth of October came the not unex- 
pected news of the death of Grant Allen. Born a 
Canadian, in 1848, his education was completed in Eu- 
rope, and, after taking an Oxford degree, he turned to 
teaching. An educational post in Jamaica held him for 
some years, after which he returned to England. He 
soon turned his attention to writing, his first book being 
the " Physiological -^Esthetics " of 1877. Other serious 
works were " The Color Sense," " Charles Darwin," and 
" Anglo-Saxon Britain." A series of books made up of 
studies in popular science won for him a large circle of 
readers. About twelve years ago he turned to fiction, 
and produced a series of novels which were pot-boilers 
unabashed but proved highly successful as producers of 
an income. " The Tents of Shem " and " The Woman 
Who Did " are among the best known of these pro- 
ductions. 

The retirement of Mr. E. L. Godkin from the active 
editorial control of the New York " Evening Post " and 
" Nation " has just been announced, and is a matter of 
deep concern to all intelligent Americans. As the guid- 
ing spirit, first of the weekly paper and afterwards of 
the daily as well, Mr. Godkin has been one of the 
strongest forces in our public life, and, what is more 
important, a force almost invariably exercised in beh:ilf 
of the highest ideals of intelligence and morality. Not 
long ago, one of the English reviews spoke of his activ- 
ity and influence as comparable with that so long exer- 
cised in England by John Stuart Mill; and the coinp;ir- 
ison is a just one. Whenever a great cause has needed 
a defender in this country, from the early days of the 
Reconstruction period to these later days which so om- 
inously threaten a departure from the political principles 
that have made our country great, such a defender has 
been found in the person of Mr. (iodkin, and his voice 
has been uplifted with no uncertain sound in behalf of 
truth and justice, no matter how unwelcome to the pop- 
ulace such utterances might be. Few men have done our 
country such true and loyal service as this adopted citi- 
zen of the Republic, and we trust that his retirement from 
the editorial desk will not mean the end of his active 
influence as a moulder of enlightened pnblie opinion.

NEW BOOKS 



Love -Letters of a Musician 

By MYRTLE REED. 8vo, gilt top, $1.75. 

A collection of imaginary epistles addressed by a young 
violinist to his lady during the year following his rejection. 

" Quite ingeniously the author sets her love plaints to appropriate 
tempos, beginning with a mournful largo movement that bubbles into 
an allegro vivace, changing to suit a tender andante amoroso and all 
ending in a jubilate which accompanies the happy wedding march. Miss 
Reed's epistolary conceit is very pleasing, and her well-turned phrases 
and pretty sentiment, which is never allowed to become mawkish, 
clothe her subject fittingly." Chicago Evening Post. 

"The story which is told in the love letters is as beautiful as the 
manner of telling, and Myrtle Reed has made a contribution to the 
lover's literature of the world as precious as the ' Sonnets from the 
Portuguese,' and hardly less poetic." Lexington (Ky.) Herald. 

Sleepy-Time Stories 

By MAUD B. BOOTH (Mrs. Ballington Booth). With a 

preface by CHATJNCEY M. DEPEW. Illustrated by MAUD 

HUMPHREY. 8vo, gilt top, $1 50. 

Dr. Depew writes in his preface : " In the dreary desert of 
child-lore, it is like an oasis to the thirsty soul to find so 
bright, loving, and natural an interpreter and instructor as 
Mrs. Ballington Booth. ... In putting into print for others 
these treasures of her own nursery she has made all children 
her debtors."

The volumes will be found as interesting as stories, and,

of proportion.

HENRY IRVING ELLEN TERRY. A book of Portraits, by GORDON CKM 
4to, boards, $1.00. Also an edition of one hundred copies printed on special 
paper, bound in cloth, $3.50. 

Mr. Gordon Craig (Miss Terry's son) has for some time been known in England as a clever artist of the 
Nicholson school. His work is extremely simple and brilliant. He has made portraits of his mother and Sir 
Henry in their best-known parts. The pictures are all reproduced in color. 

TWO GENTLEMEN IN TOURAINE. With many full-page illustrations re- 
produced in photogravure. 8vo, cloth, $5.00 net. 

A delightful account of the wanderings of an American gentleman and a French count through the his- 
torical chateaux in Touraine. It gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the famous people who lived 
in them, and admirable descriptions of the country. It is a book for the holidays and for general reading. 

THE LIFE OF WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. By LEWIS M . i 
VILLE. With portraits, facsimile of handwriting, and several drawings, ninny 
now printed for the first time. In two volumes, demy 8vo, cloth gilt, $10.00. 

Although five and thirty years have passed since bis death, until now there has never been published a life 
of Thackeray which has had any pretensions to finality. The present work has been written to fill this void in the 
literary history of the century. It is a complete record of the career of the great novelist and throws many new 
lights upon his private as well as his public life. Thackeray is presented as novelist, poet, artist, and art critic, 
and his friendships and tastes are recorded. 

SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN. His Life Story, with Letters and Reminiscences. 
By ARTHUR LAWRENCE. With many illustrations. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

This is the authorized biography of the great composer. It has been prepared under his personal super- 
vision, and revised by him in proof. It contains many of his letters and much intimate personal matter of great 
interest. 

THE INDIANS OF TO-DAY. By GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL. With fifty full- 
page portraits of the most famous chiefs, and four pictures in color. 4to, buck- 
ram, $5.00. Also a special limited edition of one hundred copies on hand-made 
paper, $10.00 net. 

It is generally acknowledged that Mr. Grinnell is the authority on American Indians. For the first time 
in many years a serious attempt is made to deal fairly with the Indian of to-day: his past, his present conditions, 
and his future chances. The book is illustrated with a remarkable series of photographs, taken by Mr. F. A. 
Rinehart during the Congress of Indians at the Omaha Exposition. 

FAMOUS LADIES OF THE ENGLISH COURT. By Mrs. AUBREY RICH- 
ARDSON. With over one hundred portraits and illustrations. 8vo, cloth. 
$3.50 net. 

Mrs. Richardson has chosen a fascinating subject and has treated it in the most interesting manner. She 
has told the story of the principal beauties of the English Court, their lives, their friends, and their scandals. It 
is a gossipy volume, made possible only through the courtesy of many titled persons, who have furnished detail-, 
letters, and portraits.

TRINITY BELLS. 
A Tale of Old New York. 

By AMELIA E. BARR. Sixteen full-page illustrations by 

C. M. Relyea. Cloth, small 8vo, $1.50. 

A more charming picture o life in the early days of our country has 
never been painted than the one Mrs. Barr has given in " Trinity Bells. " 
Like "The Bow of Orange Ribbon," it is a romance of old New York, 
and shows to perfection Mrs. Barr's subtle charm and power. 

A charming love story is woven through the romance, set to the 
music of the bells Trinity bells whose silver notes sound their 
message of hope and joy throughout the story. 

EZEKIEL'S SIN: 
A Cornish Romance. 

By J. H. PEARCE, author of " Eli's Daughter," " Inconse- 
quent Lives," etc. 

" ' Ezekiel's Sin ' is a notable novel. It has a good, strong plot, and 
the story is well told. The book is a gallery of rarely good portraiture. 
Excellently, too, it depicts the life, rough and daring, hard and coarse, 
yet withal clean and true and tender, of the crabbers and fisherfolk of 
the Cornish coast. 'Ezekiel's Sin' is the best novel this year." 
Mutical Courier. 



LITTLE LEATHER BREECHES, 
And Other Southern Rhymes. 

Being a number of folk-lore songs, negro rhymes, street ven- 
ders' cries, etc., gathered from various parts of the South. 
Collected and arranged by FRANCIS P. WIGHTMAN. 48 
full-page colored illustrations and cover by the author. 
4to, $2.00. 

" Little Leather Breeches " is something absolutely fresh and novel. 
The verses are the result of several years' research by the author, and 
have been carefully selected from the numerous songs and legends of 
the Gulf States, the Atlantic Seaboard, and the Inland States of the 
South. The illustrations are executed with consummate skill and a 
delicious sense of humor which make the pictures worthy of special 
notice. The folk-lore songs and verses are of permanent interest.

PUBLIC OPINION 

II ASTOR PLACE, NEW YORK CITY. 



The Old Masters 

Notwithstanding the fact that they are glibly discussed, are 
nevertheless almost entire strangers to the novices in art as 
well as to the general public. The reason for this is, that 
aside from the more or less slight sketches in encyclopaedias 
and in the so-called art " handbooks," the lives of the masters 
have been comprehensively dealt with only in expensive 
treatises, and are accessible, therefore, only to a narrow cir- 
cle of readers, and to those mainly in public libraries. It was 
with a view of reaching the many cultivated readers and stu- 
dents of art who cannot afford to possess these more expensive 
treatises, but who nevertheless desire a closer acquaintance 
with, and knowledge of, the great masters that Professor H. 
KNACKFUSS was induced to undertake the series of 

| MONOGRAPHS ON ARTISTS 

in which the great periods of art, and the lives of those who 
took leading parts in developing art in all its phases, are 
treated with scientific thoroughness in a manner which 
makes it comprehensible to all. In this endeavor Professor 
KNACKFUSS has been ably seconded by the publisher, who 
has spared no expense in giving the text a dignified and artis- 
tic dress, and adding to it everything in the way of illustration 
that could amplify the author's meaning, as well as to convey 
to the reader, by means of excellent reproductive processes, 
a vivid idea of the masters' greatest works. And all this at 
a price which places this series within the reach of those with 
the most limited means. Thus far the subjects treated are 

RAPHAEL . . HOLBEIN . . REMBRANDT 
VAN DYCK. 

Translated into English by CAMPBELL DODGSON. 
Each volume, artistically bound, 8vo .... $1.50 

Other volumes are in preparation. This series may safely be recom- 
mended to the artist, the student, and the lover of art, the teacher and 
the general public as text-books or as holiday gifts.

the floor from all droppings of oil, lint, etc. By this 
device the machine is thoroughly protected from dust, 
and the stand forms an ornamental and useful table 
that is fitting and appropriate to any home. The hinged 
extension-leaf covering the machine when down is folded 
back when it is raised, thus making a table-top measur- 
ing 40 inches in length by 16 in width, affording ample

" These volumes will contain upwards of four hundred and fifty 
letters nearly double the number of those which have been and 
are appearing in SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE." THE ATHEN^UM. 



The New York Evening Post, speaking of the serial publication, said: 

" '""THE final instalment of Stevenson's letters, in Scribner's, can but leave us wishing he had lived to write 
1 more of them. A few more like his best, and he might have been better remembered for his letters 
than his books. Fine flashes of criticism light up his correspondence." 

"IT bids fair to become one of those works which are 
kept very close to the arm-chair, and kept there not 
merely during its first public vogue, but continuously." 
The Academy. 

" /JMONG the correspondents addressed are many well-known men of letters and artists, both deceased and 
living, as Mr. P. G. Hamerton, Mr. J. A. Symonds, Mr. F. Locker-Lampson, Mr. William Morris, Mr. 
Will H. Low, Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens, Mr. Henry James, Mr. Edmund Gosse, Mr. W. E. Henley, Mr. Cosmo 
Monkhouse, Mr. Theodore Watts- Dunton, Mr. J. M. Barrie, Mr. Crockett, Dr. Conan Doyle, M. Marcel Schwob,

With 150 illustrations. 8vo, $2.50. 
" IV\R' MITCHELL, as we have said, is a veteran, per- 
' * haps the veteran, of American letters. His first book 
was published in 1847 ; his latest, not his last, as we have 
reason in his preface to infer, now lies before us, warm from 
the press, quickened with alert and unflagging sympathy 
with men and books, a little shaded with a certain wistful, 
half-diffident regret for the worthies and standards of long 
ago, but written in a vein of intrinsic grace and charm that 
even the most ' contemporaneous '-minded of the generation 
whose spokesman is Kipling may well relish." .The Dial.

"'"THEY are what the man was, strong, hasty some- 
1 times, lively always, and alert with human inter- 
est and sympathy. At times his letters fairly sparkle 
with the joy of new artistic sensation, the exuberance 
of a revelation in music and scholarship. So, though 
most of these letters have been printed before, they 
have a unique flavor that justifies gathering them for 
preservation and reference." The Churchman.

Some Delightful Books for the Holidays. 



Howard Pyle's New Book: THE PRICE OF BLOOD. 

By HOWARD PYLE. Large 8vo, $1.25. 

An Extravaganza of New York Life in 1807. Written in five chapters and illustrated by HOWARD PYLE. 

This unique and entertaining Extravaganza has to do with a young lawyer of the metropolis, a handsome 
young lady, four remarkable clients, and a series of the most extraordinary adventures. The illustrations are 
done in Mr. Pyle's most attractive manner, and consist of a cover design, a frontispiece in seven printings, 
and five full-page illustrations in two colors. 

Walter Crane's New Book: THE SIRENS THREE. 

By WALTER CRANE. 4to, green and gold, $1.25. 

This noble poem, which is cast after much the same manner as the Rubaiyat, is presented in a worthy 
form, with more than 40 full-page decorations by Mr. Crane in a new cover design in green and gold. At the 
low price at which it is published ($1.25) it should prove one of the most acceptable of all the holiday books 

t e year. JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE'S NEW BOOK. 

THE V-A-S-E AND OTHER BRIC-A-BRAC. 

A Volume of Humorous Verse by the author of " Her Majesty the King." 12mo, $1.00. 
" Her Majesty the King " had the distinction of being hailed as " the wittiest book of the year " (it is now 
in ha fourth edition and selling better than ever) and " The V-a-s-e " is likely to add still more to Mr. Roche's 
reputation. It is certainly the most deliciously humorous verse that has appeared in many, many years. 

SOCK AND BUSKIN BIOGRAPHIES. I. JULIA MARLOWE. 

By JOHN D. BARRY. About 40 illustrations. 12mo, decorative boards, 75 cents. 

This volume, forming the first of the " Sock and Buskin Biographies," is a carefully written life and appre- 
ciation of this popular actress. Miss Marlowe has placed at Mr. Barry's disposal all necessary data, and has 
helped him in every possible way, thus making the volume at once authoritative and definitive. The illustra- 
tions, over thirty in number, show Miss Marlowe in all the characters in which she has ever appeared. 

A Book of New Fairy Tales : THE FAIRY SPINNING WHEEL. 

From the French of CATULLE MENDES. Illustrated. 4to, $1.50. 

Catulle Mendes introduces us to a new realm of fairydom, and the charm of the new heroes and fairies 
the kings of Mataguin and the Golden Isle, the Emperors of Trebizonde and Sirinagon, and the Wicked Melan- 
drine, among others will appeal to all. There is no more beautiful collection of fairy stories extant than 
those " The Fairy Spinning Wheel " tells, what with their quaint, unexpected turns, charming conceits, and 
happy rendering. The stories have never before appeared in English. A more charming gift book for chil- 
dren will be hard to find. 

ILLUSTRATED DITTIES OF THE OLDEN TIME. 

4to, decorative boards, 75 cents. 

This fascinating little volume was originally issued in England half-a-centnry ago. The " Ditties " them- 
selves are so delightfully quaint and the drawings so thoroughly charming that the publishers believe the 
reprint to be fully justified. THE QNLy COMpLETE RENDERINQ IN VERSE OF 

THE SICILIAN IDYLLS OF THEOCRITUS. 

Translated into English Lyric Measures by MARION MILLS MILLER, L.H.D. With an Introduction by HAMLIN 

GARLAND. 16mo, flexible leather, $1.25. 

Says Mr. Garland in h is Preface : " I am very much pleased with the attempt of Dr. Miller to make the dialect country 
verse of Theocritus vital and real to us of to-day. He has made me perceive the scenes of the poet's verse more nearly than 

1 had hitherto supposed could be done. The men of that day were alive. Their language was not a dead language, and 
Dr. Miller has gone far in rendering Greek forms in modern moods and measures." 

FRENCH PORTRAITS. 

APPRECIATIONS OP THE WRITERS OF YOUNG FRANCE. 

By VANCE THOMPSON. About 80 illustrations. 300 pages. 8vo, buckram, paper label, $2.50. 
Mr. Thompson has known, personally, all those men of whom he writes ; he understands and sympathizes with their 
different points of view, and he writes with a style which is in itself so interesting that one would read the book for that 
alone. The best idea of the unusual scope of the volume may be gained from its table of contents : 1. Paul Verlaine. 
2. Stephane MaHamae". 3. The Belgian Renascence : Camille Lemonnier, Maurice Maeterlinck, Eniile Verhaeren, Georges 
Eekhoud, Georges Rodenback, Max Elskamp, and Fernand Severin. 4. The Last of the Parnassians: Catulle Monde's. 
5. Jean More"as and his Disciples. 6. The New Poetry : Free Verse, Adolph Rette", Henri de Rggnier, Stuart Merrill and 
Francis Ville'-Griffin, Emmanuel Signoret, and Albert Samain. 7. The Paganism of Pierre Louys. 8. Jean Richepinand

A HISTORY OF QUAKER GOVERNMENT 
IN PENNSYLVANIA. 

By ISAAC SHARPLESS, LL.D., PRESIDENT OF HAVERFORD COLLEGE. 
VOLUME II. THE QUAKERS IN THE REVOLUTION. 

The first part of this work under the title of " A Quaker Experiment in Government," was published in the 
Spring of 1898, and met a warm reception from press and public, and a ready sale. It carried the narrative 
from the founding of the Commonwealth down to the year 1756, when the conflict between the peace principles 
of the Quakers and the warlike trend of events first reached a crisis. The present volume traces the same conflict 
through the stormy events of the Revolution, and examines its momentous results. 

Two volumes, 12mo, with numerous portraits, and other illustrations. 

Cloth extra, $3.00 ; Half Morocco, gilt top, $5 00. Volumes sold separately. 
Volume I. A Quaker Experiment in Government, $1.50, $2.50. Volume II. The Quakers in the Revolution, $1.50, $2.50.

SYMBOLS AND EMBLEMS-ILLUSTRATED. 

BY H. J. SMITH. 

An indispensable book for all architects, designers, and draughtsmen, and for workmen in the artistic, deco- 
rative, and high-class building trades. The author, an eminent designer in stained glass, has been impressed with 
the fact that in art education of our day the subject of Symbolism seems to have been overlooked. "Very little 
direct instruction upon it seems to be given in the art schools, and graduates are left to learn at haphazard or to 
guess at the meaning of the symbols that are used so lavishly in our churches." The reason for this general neglect 
is to be found in the fact that the many works on the subject were written by and for the theologian and the 
arcbseologist, and are too abstruse to be used as works of popular reference. 

This is both a popular and a comprehensive manual of the subject. It is made as plain and concise as possible, 
and is thus enabled to illustrate and explain with all necessary fulness over three hundred and fifty symbols, 
including all the most familiar forms a far greater number than is contained in any other work. 

Illustrations are arranged in one hundred magnificent full-page quarto plates, each plate being accompanied by 
one or more pages of explanatory letter-press. 

Royal quarto, printed on extra heavy deckle-edged paper, bound in illuminated art vellum, $5 00.

" L fail to see how the book could be substantially improved except by enlargement. . . . On the whole the 
work is admirable." C. H. HASTINGS in American Journal of Sociology. 

" An unusually serviceable work. ... An admirably classified list of the best scientific books upon every 
phase of the labor question." The Outlook (New York).

PAUPERIZING THE RICH. 

BY ALFRED J. FERRIS. 

A " suggested solution of this modern problem of the Sphinx which confronts the twentieth century," as it is 
called in an appreciative review in the (London) Friend, reaching the conclusion that " whether we agree with the 
author or not, we do well to consider it carefully. . . . The leading ideas of this volume are worth thinking over.'

both of charity and of justice." Outlook (New York).

A MEMORY FOREVER. 



A recent contributor to our English contem- 
porary, " The Academy," has been sharpening 
his wits to a rather fine point in protesting 
against the introduction of school children, at 
too early an age, to the masterpieces of English 
poetry. His special text is found in Gray's 
" Elegy," and his childish recollections of that 
poem are decidedly diverting. 

" I remember how I used to grind through it without 
one word of explanation when I was a little fellow of 
ten years of age [observe, ten!]: each line went by 
itself, and one consequence was that the thing in the 
piece that impressed me most was the reference to 

'The dark, nnfathomed caves of ocean bear.' 
I had had my neck nearly wrung off in those days for 
once saying that a noun ' governed ' something, and I 
was not the boy to risk further twisting by asking if it 
was the polar bear that was meant; but there was a 
magnificent remoteness in the dwelling of this creature 
that always pleased me, and it was not till later that I 
discovered what the verse really meant." 

Continuing, in similar strain, he asks : 

" What boy ever believed in the ' hoary-headed swain ' 
or the ' forefathers of the hamlet ' ? As for the youth 
who gave to Misery all he had, a tear, and gained from 
Heaven, 'twas all he wish'd, a friend, no schoolboy ever 
understood that transaction. And this poem, which boys 
cannot understand, and masters cannot hope to explain, 
is our accepted introduction to poetry." 

A like protest has been made, time and time 
again, against the rigid drill in Homer and 
Virgil which schoolmasters have deemed the 
necessary foundation of a sound classical edu- 
cation. These names become in recollection 
the symbols of a disagreeable experience, and 
whatever natural proclivities a youth may have 
for the enjoyment of poetry become stifled by 
such a premature attempt to force his taste. 
The result is that, from the time of his emanci- 
pation from this compulsory application of the 
classics, he shuns them ever afterwards, and, 
as one humorist has put it, acquires as the 
fruits of his training in Greek and Latin little 
more than the firm conviction that two such 
languages exist. 

There is, no doubt, a certain force in protests 
of this sort, and injudicious methods in the 
education of young people have done much to 
justify the complaint ; but there is another side 
to the question, a side which is, on the whole, 



350 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



the stronger of the two, and which there is a 
growing tendency among educators to ignore. 
The great variety of new educational devices 
which are nowadays urged upon the bewildered 
young teacher are too apt to have this in com- 
mon, that they involve a relaxation of discipline 
for tli- student, and take from him the sense of 
responsibility for his own performance. If a 
problem seems too hard, there is always some 
one at hand to relieve him of the effort neces- 
sary to master it, and he is encouraged to seek 
such relief before he has half exhausted his own 
resources. Already many voices are raised 
among wisely conservative educators of long 
experience, warning the public of the conse- 
quences of this drift of our methods of instruc- 
tion. By dint of this smoothing over of all 
difficulties we are not developing the intel- 
lectual stamina that was a product of the 
severer methods of the past ; and, however 
glibly we may talk about the encouragement 
of self-activity, we are really playing with it, 
instead of setting it in the forefront of our 
endeavors. 

Recurring to the special subject of literature, 
there is a good deal to be said for the old- 
fashioned plan of anticipating the tastes that 
later years may be expected to develope. This 
does not necessarily mean that the mental maw 
of a child of ten should be crammed with poems 
like the " Elegy," but it does mean, first, that 
nothing but very good literature should be given 
to school children, and, second, that it may 
safely be literature considerably in advance of 
their complete comprehension. The notion that 
it must all be explained and digested then and 
there is fatal to the growth of appreciation. 
Give a child something that appeals to him in 
part, and the sense of mystery which invests 
the rest of the work brings the best possible 
stimulus to his growth in the right direction. 
And then there is the faculty of memory to be 
considered. The disrepute into which cultiva- 
tion of the memory has fallen is one of the most 
alarming features of recent theorizing, and no 
educational word is to-day more needed than a 
strong reinsertion of the claims of this faculty 
upon the attention of the teacher. The right kind 
of student, struggling with the construction and 
the scansion of his Milton or his Virgil, and 
receiving only a dim sort of illumination upon 
his path, is all the while enriching his memory 
unawares with cadenced phrases that will reecho 
in his consciousness through the years to come, 
and give him spiritual sustenance in a future 
that would be harsh indeed without their soften- 



ing ministry. We say the right kind of stu- 
dent the other kind, whose occasional ex- 
istence must be admitted, had better give up 
the pursuit of literary culture when it becomes 
certain that the portals of that paradise are not 
to be opened for him, and take to chemistry, 
or civil engineering, or political economy. But 
because there are in every generation some such 
men and women, subject to limitations that 
permanently exclude them from sharing in the 
highest hopes and aspirations of humanity, 
although capable of a life of honest activity 
upon some lower intellectual plane, let us take 
good heed not to add to their numbers through 
neglect of the agencies provided for our hand 
in the early years of training. It is better at 
the start to set the highest aim for all, abandon- 
ing it only in those cases whose development 
clearly proves it unattainable, than to set a 
lower aim merely because we may hope for its 
realization by a larger number of souls. 

"Not failure, bat low aim, is crime." 

In the matter of education, no less than of the 
subjective ideal, these words of Lowell are 
eternally true. 

A thing of beauty is a joy forever, because, 
when it has once entered fully into the con- 
sciousness, it becomes a memory forever. We 
must not expect this penetrating process to be 
accomplished all at once. Of course, no child 
will half understand the beauty of a great 
poem or a fine example of imaginative prose. 
Let it but kindle his thought at a single point, 
and awaken his interest in partial degree only ; 
the slow and semi-conscious development of 
his intellect may be trusted to carry on the 
work of assimilation to its completion. How 
many a writer has borne testimony to this 
fructifying influence of noble literature in the 
mind of childhood. The following passage 
from Mr. Ruskin's "Fors" has been quoted 
more than once, but we must quote it again, 
because it tells the whole story : 

' My mother forced me, by steady daily toil, to learn 
long chapters of the Bible by heart; as well as to read 
it every syllable through, aloud, hard names and all, 
from Genesis to the Apocalypse, about once a year; and 
to that discipline patient, accurate, and resolute I 
owe, not only a knowledge of the book, which I find oc- 
casionally serviceable, but much of my general power 
of taking pains, and the best part of my taste in liter- 
ature." 

Our modern education is at fault if it does 
not find place for some such discipline as this 
during those precious early years so soon at 
an end when the fresh receptivity of the mind 
is not dulled, and the memory cheerfully re-

spends to the stimulus of serious reading. Most 
men in middle life find that they preserve a 
more vivid recollection of their reading of 
twenty or thirty years ago than of the reading 
done by them at a very recent date. 

There is perhaps no other of the great poets 
of the world quite equal to Virgil in the pos- 
session of the quality whereby the phrases 
imperfectly apprehended by childhood become 
an ever richer possession as time rolls by. For 
two thousand years the mintage of his thought 
has had this magical power to associate itself 
with the tenderest memories and the inmost 
sympathies of men. We all know Matthew 
Arnold's exquisite reference to the 

" Virgilian cry, 
The sense of tears in mortal things." 

We all know, too, the series of instances so 
effectively marshalled by Mr. Frederic Myers 
in that essay on Virgil which is " classical " in 
more senses than one. Less familiar, however, 
are the two passages adduced in support of this 
claim by a recent correspondent of " The Na- 
tion," passages which reveal the minds of Rob- 
ert Louis Stevenson and John Henry Newman, 
so dissimilar in most respects, for once work- 
ing in complete harmony. This is what we find 
in "The Ebb -Tide": 

" The Virgil, which he could not exchange against a 
meal, had often consoled him in his hunger. He would 
study it, ... seeking favorite passages, and find- 
ing new ones only less beautiful because they lacked the 
consecration and remembrance. Or he would pause on 
random country walks, sit on the pathside, gazing over 
the sea on the mountains of Eimeo, and dip into the 
'^Eneid,' seeking sortes. And if the oracle (as is the 
way of oracles) replied with no very certain or encour- 
aging voice, visions of England, at least, would throng 
upon the exile's memory the busy school - room, the 
green playing-fields, holidays at home, and the peren- 
nial roar of London, and the fireside, and the white 
head of his father. For it is the destiny of these grave, 
restrained, and classic writers, with whom we make en- 
forced and often painful acquaintance at school, to pass 
into the blood and become native in the memory; so 
that a phrase of Virgil speaks not so much of Mantua 
or Augustus, but of English places and the student's 
own irrevocable youth." 

The other excerpt is from the " Grammar of 
Assent," and links with the name of Virgil the 
suggestion of Homer and Horace: 

" Passages which to a boy are but rhetorical com- 
monplaces, neither better nor worse than a hundred 
others which any clever writer might supply, which he 
gets by heart and thinks very fine, and imitates, as he 
thinks, successfully in his own flowing versification, at 
length come home to him when long years have passed 
and he has had experience of life, and pierce him as if 
he had never before known them, with their said earn- 
estness and vivid exactness. Then he comes to under- 
stand how it is that lines, the birth of some chance 



morning or evening at an Ionian festival, or among the 
Sabine hills, have lasted generation after generation for 
thousands of years, with a power over the mind, and a 
charm, which the current literature of his own day, with 
all its obvious advantages, is utterly unable to rival. 
Perhaps this is the reason of the mediaeval opinion 
about Virgil, as if a prophet or magician ; his single 
words and phrases, his pathetic half- lines, giving utter- 
ance, as the voice of Nature herself, to that pain and 
weariness, yet hope of better things, which is the ex- 
perience of her children in every time." 

The seeming drudgery of the old-fashioned 
type of education was well worth the while if it 
resulted in such memory-deposits as these, and 
it becomes little less than a crime to waste the 
opportunity, which early youth alone offers, of 
fertilizing the mind with the pollen that may, 
if all goes well, yield such a harvest in the 
later years. 



THE "PASSING" OF MATTHEW 
ARNOLD. 

It is no doubt an advantage of the philosophy of 
evolution, so popular in its manifold application 
to-day, that it tends to clear the ground of a hamper- 
ing accumulation of methods and results from the 
past, and give a freer hand to the workers of the 
present. But the true evolutionist recognizes the 
permanent elements which pass on from stage to 
stage of development, no less than the vanishing 
characteristics of the single stage. The ambitious 
builder of the present day, then, must be careful in 
preparing his site that he does not waste energy and 
time in removing solid rock. 

Some ten years ago, a band of self-appointed 
defenders of America and its institutions undertook 
to drive Matthew Arnold out of court with clubs 
and tomahawks. He was a snob, an aristocrat, and 
an ignoramus, knowing nothing of American insti- 
tutions and not much of anything else, without the 
ability even to use the English language correctly, 
on the hypothesis that he had anything to say. But 
such attacks really did more good than harm, since 
they convinced the judicious that the critic's verdict, 
"Thou ailest here, and here," was timely and well- 
grounded ; and an increasing number of Americans 
went on reading Mr. Arnold's works with profit and 
enjoyment. When his "Letters" were given to 
eagerly waiting readers, a few years ago, the editor 
deemed it expedient in his prefatory remarks po- 
litely to dismiss from consideration no small share 
of Arnold's life's work : " His theology, once the 
subject of some just criticism, seems now a matter 
of comparatively little moment." But Arnold 
minus his distinctively theological writings is still 
an author of considerable proportions and possible

[Nov. 16, 



his theological essays when the back of his literary 
executor was turned. 

Bat now comes a critic who seems at first view 
to cut the ground entirely from under our feet. 
With the sweeping thoroughness of the Roman 
Emperor who would have had the necks of his sub- 
jects all united in one, that a single blow of the 
sword might finish the business, the author of 
" Social Ideals in English Letters " ranges Arnold's 
entire work under the social motive and calmly as- 
signs it to a shelf in the Museum of Historical 
Sociology : " Already we look back to Arnold's 
strong and vivid work as belonging rather to his- 
tory than to the things that are." There is an air 
of the inevitable about these words that makes 
one hesitate to challenge them, for fear he may 
accomplish nothing but to demonstrate his own 
fitness for a place in the museum ; but even at 
that risk we are not willing to give up Arnold with- 
out a struggle. 

Using the word " social " in the broad sense in- 
tended throughout Miss Scudder's book, one finds 
no difficulty in agreeing with her that Arnold's aim 
"was everywhere social." It is only when she 
comes down to details of interpretation, that there 
is reasonable ground for difference. And the writer, 
for one, feels strongly that there is such ground at 
the very point wherein seems to lie the motive for 
the verdict which has been quoted. Miss Scudder 
writes not as the indifferent historian, seeking only 
to set before the reader the dry facts as to the 
social ideals of English men of letters, with no opin- 
ions of her own to maintain : she is the open cham- 
pion of the movement to better the social condition 
of the masses, and naturally anxious that substantial 
results shall not be too long delayed. Now, writ- 
ing from this point of view, and, we believe, not 
keeping vividly in mind certain features of Arnold's 
method, she has come to the unnecessary conclusion 
that further social progress is possible only when he 
is left behind. After summing up the character- 
istics of the Greek temperament which he thought it 
necessary to inculcate in order to the development 
of a symmetrical English character, she adds : 
" And meanwhile we must wholly abstain from ac- 
tion." Now, if Arnold had held theoretically that 
total abstention from action was necessary until 
the process of tempering British Hebraism with a 
suitable admixture of Hellenism should be fairly 
accomplished, the prospect for results under such 
a method would indeed be discouraging. Nor 
could he be defended against the charge of glaring 
inconsistency, since he did not wholly abstain from 
action himself, nor did he fail to find due occasion 
for encouraging others to action, both individual 
and legislative. But one is not driven to the neces- 
sity of interpreting his published words by his indi- 
vidual course as a citizen and member of society. 
A careful reading of his essays amply warrants the 
statement that he did not contemplate absolute ab- 
stention from action even as a temporary expedient. 



What he deprecated was ill-advised action, based 
on an incomplete and misleading conception of cir- 
cumstances and relations. No doubt he would have 
included under this head a very large proportion of 
the philanthropic action, individual and organized, of 
his time, too large a proportion, if you will. But 
such a mere mistaking of degree, if mistake there 
was, does not bring him into conflict with progress, 
and is of little importance. It certainly bore a less 
ratio to his quantum of correct judgment than the 
mistakes of the average British or American social 
reformer and philanthropist to his instances of wise 
action. With penetrating insight, he was painfully 
aware that an immense amount of earnest and well- 
intended effort was at best missing its aim, and in 
many cases doing positive harm, because of the lack 
of a free play of ideas " upon the subject in ques- 
tion. Such a free play of ideas he considered it his 
mission to promote. And we may say that his aim 
was everywhere this, as well as to say that it was 
everywhere social. But when we approach it from 
this side it is easy to see that his work does not 
necessarily pass from the domain of living impor- 
tance with the age that produced it. The habit of 
ill-considered action, growing out of the failure to 
bring a free play of ideas to bear, is as old as human 
history and bids fair to remain among us for many 
generations yet to come. And while it does remain, 
there will always be occasion for effort to deprecate 
over-hasty action, and to stimulate thought, in all 
lines of social progress. Hebraism in its own home 
produced a literature of conduct which the world 
has never yet passed by, and never will pass by 
until some other nation puts a better in its place. 
Hellenism likewise bore fruit for which the world 
is sure to have use until it is surpassed in its own 
kind. Arnold saw that the highest type of human 
development must effect a fitting synthesis of the 
two (not of course excluding the possibility of the 
development of still other traits, which neither He- 
brews nor Hellenes brought into prominence), and 
he gave to English letters an extended series of 
brilliant essays in that direction. He did not think 
to revolutionize society at once, though he was no 
pessimist, as many who have not read him, and are 
hardly prepared to understand him if they should, 
would have us believe. But he would have been 
very much surprised to be told by one so sympa- 
thetic as Miss Scudder that his work would belong 
to history, rather than to the things that are, as soon 
as a portion of his " remnant " should have assumed 
for a few years an attitude of deep thought and 
scrupulous inaction. What he wanted was to set up 
a process of "osmosis " of the best traits of Hebra- 
ism and Hellenism through the separating mem- 
brane of British prejudice and indifference, and by 
this means he trusted to accelerate the rise from 
the culture-level of the majority to that of the rem- 
nant No one would have been less pleased than he 
to be told that his work was on a level with that of 
the Greeks and Hebrews, for he would readily have

recognized such a statement as clumsy and insin- 
cere flattery; but he was a good judge of effective 
English expression, and he doubtless expected his 
books to live and carry on his mission until super- 
seded by another who should say substantially the 
same things in a manner still more attractive and 
effective. That has not yet been done, and perhaps 
one will not give unpardonable offense to the literary 
guild of the present day by suggesting that there is 
no immediate prospect of its being done. And yet 
no thoughtful friend of Arnold need feel any satis- 
faction that this is so, for he himself was so single- 
minded in pursuit of his end that he would have 
hailed gladly an eclipse of that sort. 

As regards Mr. Russell's apology for Arnold's 
theological writings, we can hardly see that even 
this was necessary or advisable. In this field Ar- 
nold was working, not for positive results in the 
way of a detailed theological platform, but for an 
honest and discriminating method. A continually 
growing number are willing to admit within certain 
limits the existence of the "unbridled license of 
affirmation " in religious matters which he attacked 
with such vigor. He has made a great many read- 
ers realize that vivid hope and faith are not identi- 
cal with scientific demonstration, and that harm is 
sure to come from failure to realize the distinction 
either in thought or in language. One who reads 
him with care can see that he has no quarrel with 
those who can base upon the data at hand a more 
comprehensive belief than his. He is to be read, 
then, not for detailed information as to what one 
should believe and what reject in religious matters, 
but to place the curb of intelligent discrimination 
upon one's belief, and especially to check the habit 
of demanding of them that are weak in the faith 
tests that are not fundamentally necessary and are 
sure to repel. He held to his ideal of the free play 
of thought in the realm of religion as tenaciously as 
anywhere else. 

As some of our older bards have gradually fallen 
into the position of "poets of the poets," so Arnold, 
if we mistake not, will become more and more the 
reformer of reformers. With the earnest desire 
for the good of his fellow-men which is char- 
acteristic of all sincere reformers, he had also the 
mental poise, the control of the emotions, and the 
logical temper, which the reform spirit is too apt to 
lack. And the multiplied cases of well-intended 
effort that failed because of that lack must gradu- 
ally drive intelligent philanthropic endeavor toward 
the path which he has pointed out. One can hardly 
conceive of his writings becoming popular in the 
usual sense of that term. The scores of thousands 
of working-men who have devoured the pages of 
" Looking Backward " during the past decade, as if 
it were a divine revelation, will live and die with no 
knowledge of Arnold ; but here and there there will 
be one of a thousand among them, with keener 
power of discernment, who will loosen with disgust 
his hold upon the air-castles of Bellamy and drop 
to the solid ground of the apostle of culture ; not, 



of course, the mawkish product which the enemies 
of Arnold have persistently attributed to him under 
that name, but the culture of which all classes may 
partake at the price of using such opportunities for 
self-improvement as are open to their efforts. And 
the philanthropist who can persuade men of thought 
to give Arnold a careful reading will do much more 
to put the ground in condition for a fruitful harvest 
than he who begins with an attempt to get Arnold 

himself out of the way.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE UNEDUCATED COLLEGE MAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The Inaugural of Dr. George Harris, Amherst's 
newly inducted President, was, as some of your readers 
doubtless know, an unusually thoughtful and suggestive 
address on the theme, " The Man of Letters in De- 
mocracy." By " man of letters " Dr. Harris meant, as 
he explained, not the professional literary man, but 
" the man that is liberally educated, the cultivated man, 
for practical purposes the college man " ; and he then 
went on to add to his definition the following remark- 
able qualification: "Although . . . there are college 
men that are uneducated." 

Now this admission, coming from such a source, and 
partially justifying as it does the common popular sneer 
at the " college graduate," seems to the present writer 
a much more serious and significant one than the rather 
airy and casual way in which it is made might lead one 
to suppose. Is it then true that our higher educational 
institutions are in the habit of graduating a proportion 
of "uneducated" young men starting them out in 
life, as it were, on a basis of intellectual false pretences, 
and equipped with a virtually fraudulent certificate of 
scholarly attainments in the shape of an unearned 
diploma ? And if this be the case, what is the degree 
of moral difference between such conduct on the part of 
a higher educational institution, and essentially similar 
conduct on the part, say, of the " bogus " medical col- 
lege which, in consideration of so many dollars, grants 
its lying " sheepskin " to anyone who chooses to apply 
for it ? The question is a nice one for the casuist. 

It really seems that there ought to be at least one 
college or university in this country whose diploma 
could be safely accepted as a positive guarantee against 
the illiteracy of its possessor. Is there such a one ? 
and, if not, to what radical defect of aim or system is 
the scandal due ? That it is not due to a lack of funds 
or equipment, is manifest ; and it is needless to say that 
our college professors in general form a body of which 
we are justly proud, and to which we look with a con- 
fidence seldom misplaced for light and leading. Why is 
it, then, that the " uneducated " college man is not only 
not a rara avis in America, but a bird so common and 
so familiar that President Harris in a public address 
serenely takes it for granted that everybody knows him, 
and that nobody would think of questioning his exist- 
ence ? Is " commercialism " in any way answerable for 
him? We are accustomed just now, perhaps reason- 
ably enough, to charge a good many of our evils to this 
score; and if it be true (as some aver) that there is a 
tendency to " commercialize " our colleges, to subordi-

nate their purelj scholastic interests to their " bosii 
interests, why, then, that tendency may in a measure 
explain the paradoxical fact that ' there are college men

numbers of students may easily outrun the discretion 
that maintains high standards of fitness, ^ ^

GREEK WITH TEARS. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

On my table lies the latest " First Greek Book," a 
good one of its type, scholarly, largely original, even 
interesting in many parts. My only cavil as to most of 
it would be, that plenty of entire chapters in Xenophon's 
immortal romance are easier, and still more interesting. 
But the luckless schoolboy, in his first lesson, is referred 
to nineteen different chapters of another volume a 
scientific grammar which he should not see for many 
months. From that grammar he must first learn two 
alphabets, complicated laws for the uses of three accents, 
paradigms, etc. " Latciale ogni iperanza " is written a 
hundred times, in no dim colors, over the first gate. 

Kindly allow a long-suffering schoolmaster to say 
that the chief difficulties of Greek are created by our 
textbook-makers, by massing at the beginning most of 
the novel elements, and by omitting everything which 
should make these elements fasciuating and instructive. 

It is the first maxim of pedagogy, and of persuasion 
generally, to connect what is new with what is already 
known and accepted. Now, every Yankee schoolboy 
has used one Hellenic alphabet ted years or more before 
he is set to learn the louic. The interrelation of the 
two is easily told, and sheds a flood of light on some 
old puzzles. Why not start your Greek primer with 
that ? There is only one serious mystery in the long 
tale, and that can be stated picturesquely, viz., that the 
group of alphabets which included the Ionian used the 
cross with the value fc-f-A, so that, to the Eastern world, 
it became, and still is, Christ's initial as well as his 
emblem; while Chalkis, and therefore Cumw, Rome, 
London, Seattle, gave X another value. A half-hour 
chalk-talk, or even a brief chapter of a primer, might 
make the " new " Greek alphabet seem an alluring 
introduction. 

That the "small letters," Greek or English, are 
merely the natural modification of the " capitals," when 
a pen takes the chisel's place, can be graphically shown. 
We claim to teach Attic fifth or fourth century Greek. 
Why should not our boy see his first sentence as Aloi- 
biades did his ? For example, 



OIIATEP4EPE 
MOIATOAEON 
TAZBXAZLAZ 

Then when the words here chosen of course, be- 
cause any decent Latinist can guess their meaning 
are transliterated, our youth may realize that accents, 
etc., were indeed benevolent inventions for the guidance 
of foreigners. 

And why three accents ? There was but one, viz., the 
rise in tone on one syllable of a word. Why not feed 
the child in the first days wholly on paroxytone o-stems, 
and " regular " verbs, until the habit of accenting at all 
is acquired ? Then, the accent miscalled and ill-written 
as " grave " is but a reminder that a final acute could not 
reach its full height if no pause followed. The (rela- 
tively rare) circumflex merely shows that the return to 



the normal tone was made within the same syllable. 
These things are true. They are simpler, more inter- 
esting, hence easier remembered, than the current 
" laws." Why is the truth too good for the beginner ? 

Comparative philology should be invoked when she 
really simplifies or illuminates with the light of un- 
doubted truth. xV' should be declined beside hor- 
tut because it will convince last year's doubting Thom- 
ases that even Latin o-stems really were stems in o, 
and it also shows the greater perfection of the Greek 
forms. 

It is a good idea to postpone the a-stems, but not to 
call them difficult. The phenomenon of " breaking," 
or change of a to ij, is chiefly obscured by the fact that 
it occurs so largely in our own vernacular: so largely, 
indeed, that the English name itself for A has " broken " 
to that given everywhere else in Europe to K. The 
relation of Attic <MA"j to Latin fama is best illustrated 
by bidding the pupil write, in Greek letters, the English 
word/ami (i. e., </>^M). 

Would such material make a primer of Greek begin 
like a volume of brief readable essays ? Perhaps so. 
If to write connectedly, interestingly, throwing fresh 
light on familiar knowledge and weaving in new facts 
so that they cannot be forgotten, is to be unscholarly, 
then our manuals are impeccable.

THE MUSIC AND COLOR OP POE. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Now that Poe as Mr. Henry Austin says in THE 
DIAL for Nov. 1 has come into his kingdom," it is 
curious to read, as I did the other day, that " Annabel 
Lee ' is a jingle," and " Ulalume " a poem that " no man 
of sound mind could enjoy." This critic, strange to say, 
is himself a known poet : but where are his ears? Music 
is surely a joy to sound minds, and nowhere, I think, 
in the language is more of it to be found than in 
"Ulalume." As in the Chorus of Witches in "Mac- 
beth," one feels what he cannot understand of its drift: 
an effect which, though frequent in musical composition, 
none but rare artists can accomplish in verse. 

Of all the American poets of his day, Poe alone fades 
not. The rest have lost color. They worked in daguer- 
reotype; he painted in oil; and fifty years hence in 
a kingdom or a republic will " rule as his desmesne " a 
" wider expanse " than the one he now dominates.

THE HUGO MEMOIRS.* 



In so far as there is very little of what may 
in strictness be termed autobiography in the 
Memoirs of Victor Hugo, the work is likely 
to prove disappointing to not a few readers. 
These will have naturally looked for something 
in the shape of a continuous narrative of a 
picturesque and checkered career a retro- 
spect and final summing up of an illustrious 
life. What they will find is a medley of cau- 
series, literary remnants, aperqus, stories in 
the style of Captain Gronow, memories of the 
stage, of the Academy, of the Chamber, of the 
Court of Louis Philippe, of Napoleon " the 
Little," of the events of '48, of the Siege of 
Paris. In fine, the Memoir is fragmentary, it 
is miscellaneous, it bubbles with sentiment and 
corruscates with Hugoesque turns of thought 
and diction, it is eminently readable, but it 
is not autobiography. As the editor, M. Paul 
Meurice, conscientiously describes it, " it is a 
sort of haphazard chronique ... a series of 
pictures of infinite variety." In externals, this 
rather stout volume of 400 odd pages is fairly 
presentable ; but in point of typography and 
proof-reading it is not, it must in candor be 
said, irreproachable. There is a tolerable front- 
ispiece portrait of the author, but no index 
an unpardonable omission in an important work 
bristling with proper names and altogether 
likely to be marked by the reader as one valu- 
able for reference in the future. 

This " haphazard chronique " of Victor 
Hugo's begins with the year 1825, with some 
memories of the coronation of Charles X. at 
Kheims " Rheims the land of chimeras, which 
is perhaps the reason that kings are crowned 
there." 

" A coronation was a godsend to Rheims. A flood of 
-opulent people inundated the city. It was the Nile that 
was passing. Landlords rubbed their hands with glee." 

Everything was forgotten, even civic pride in 
the monuments of a historic past, in the desire 
to flatter the worthless royal ex.- emigre then 
Doming (for a brief period, happily) to his own 
again. A new iconoclasm attacked the superb 
facade of the cathedral. 

" A month before the coronation a swarm of masons, 
perched on ladders and clinging to knotted ropes, spent 
a week smashing with hammers every bit of jutting

Panl Meurice. Translated by John W. Harding. New York :

sculpture on the facade, for fear a stone might become 
detached from one of these reliefs and fall on the king's 
head." 

It was during this visit to Kheims that Hugo 
first read a play of Shakespeare, " King John," 
in a little book that fell in the hands of his 
companion, Charles Nodier. He had already, 
of course, known of Shakespeare. " I knew 
him," he says, " as everybody else did, not hav- 
ing read him, and having treated him with 
ridicule." One evening it was determined to 
read " King John " that is, Nodier, who knew 
English, was to read it aloud, translating as he 
read. 

" Listeners arrived. One passes the evening as best 
one can in a provincial town on a coronation day when 
one does n't go to the ball. We formed quite a little 
club. There was an Academician, M. Roger; a man of 
letters, M. d'Eckstein; good old Marquis d'Herbouville, 
and M. He'monin, donor of the book (the ' King John ') 
that cost six sous. ' It is n't worth the money ! ' exclaimed 
M. Roger. . . . The company had ceased to read in 
order to laugh. Nodier at length became silent like 
myself. We were beaten. The gathering broke up 
with a laugh, and our visitors went away. Nodier and 
I remained alone and pensive, thinking of the great 
works that are unappreciated, and amazed that the 
intellectual education of the civilized peoples, and even 
our own, his and mine, had advanced no further than 
this." 

Some interesting details of the execution of 
Louis XVI. were gathered by Hugo in 1840 
from an eye-witness of the tragedy. 

" The executioners numbered four; two only per- 
formed the execution; the third stayed at the foot of 
the ladder, and the fourth was on the waggon which 
was to convey the King's body to the Madeleine Ceme- 
tery. . . . Two priests, commissaries of the Commune, 
sat in the Mayor's carriage laughing and conversing in 
loud tones. One of them, Jacques Roux, derisively 
drew the other's attention to Capet's fat calves and ab- 
domen. . . . The guillotine would appear to the crafts- 
men of to-day to be very badly constructed. The knife 
was simply suspended from a pulley fixed in the centre 
of the upper beam. This pulley and a rope the thick- 
ness of a man's thumb constituted the whole apparatus. 
The knife, which was not very heavily weighted, was of 
small dimensions, and had a curved edge which gave it 
the form of a reversed Phrygian cap. ... At the mo- 
ment when the head of Louis XVI. fell, the Abbe* 
Edgeworth was still near the King. The blood spirted 
upon him. He hastily donned a brown overcoat, de- 
scended from the scaffold and was lost in the crowd." 

Among his many interesting conversations 
with Louis Philippe, Victor Hugo records one 
in which the King spoke of meeting Petion 
and Robespierre at a dinner given by a wealthy 
manufacturer of Louviers, a M. Decreteau. 

" Mirabeau (said the King) aptly traced Robespierre's 
portrait in a word when he said that his face was sug- 
gestive of that of ' a cat drinking vinegar.' He was 
very gloomy and hardly spoke. When he did let drop 
a word from time to time, it was uttered sourly and

with reluctance. He seemed to be vexed at having 
come, and because I was there. In the middle of the 
dinner, Prftion, addressing M. Decrdteau, exclaimed: 
' My dear host, you must get this buck married I ' He 
pointed to Robespierre. ' What do you mean, Pe*tion ? ' 
retorted Robespierre. 'Mean,' said Pe*tion, why that 
you must get married. I insist upon marrying yon. 
You are full of sourness, hypochondria, gall, bad 
humor, biliousness, and atrabiliousness. I am fearful 
of all this on our account. What you want is a woman 
to sweeten this sourness and transform you into an 
easy-going old fogey.' Robespierre tossed his head and 
tried to smile, but only succeeded in making a grimace. 
It was the only time that I met Robespierre in society. 
After that I saw him in the tribune of the Convention. 
He was wearisome to a supreme degree, spoke slowly, 
heavily, and at length, and was more sour, more gloomy, 
more bitter than ever. It was easy to see that Pe*tion 
had not married him." 

Louis Philippe's reflections on his English 
experiences, as reported by Victor Hugo, are 
interesting. 

" Have you seen the English Parliament ? You speak 
from your place, standing, in the midst of your own 
party; you are carried away; you say more often than 
not what others think instead of what you think your- 
self. There is a magnetic communication. You are 
subjected to it. You rise (here the King rose and imi- 
tated the gesture of an orator speaking in Parliament). 
The assembly ferments all round and close to you; you 
let yourself go. On this side somebody says, ' England 
has suffered a gross insult'; and on that side, 'with 
gross indignity.' It is simply applause that is sought 
on both sides. Nothing more. But this is bad. In 
France our tribune which isolates the orator has many 
advantages. Of all the English statesmen, I have known 
only one who was able to withstand this influence of 
assemblies. He was M. Pitt. M. Pitt was a clever 
man, although he was very tall. He had an air of awk- 
wardness and spoke hesitatingly. His lower jaw 
weighed a hundredweight. . . . England resembles 
France in nothing. Over there are order, arrangement, 
symmetry, cleanliness, well-mown lawns, and profound 
silence in the streets. The passers-by are as serious 
and as mute as spectres. When, being French and 
alive, you speak in the street, these spectres look back 
at you and murmur with an inexpressible mixture of 
gravity and disdain, ' French people ! ' " 

A curious anecdote is told of a visit of Louis 
Philippe to Dreux, to put in order the bones 
in the Orleans family sepulchre which had been 
violated during the Revolution. 

" The King had the coffin brought and opened before 
him. He was alone with the chaplain and two aides- 
de-camp. Another coffin, larger and stronger, bad been 
prepared. The King himself, with his own hands, took, 
one after another, the bones of his ancestors from the 
broken coffin and arranged them in the new one. He 
would not permit anyone else to touch them. From 
time to time he counted the skulls and said: 'This is 
Monsieur the Duke de Penthievre. This is Monsieur 
the Count de Beaujolais.' Then to the best of his abil- 
ity he completed each group of bones. This ceremony 
lasted from nine o'clock in the morning until seven 
o'clock in the evening without the King taking either 
rest or nourishment." 



Let us turn to M. Hugo's memories of 
Academicians. Here is a pretty story at the 
expense of Salvandy : 

" Salvandy recently dined with Villemain. The re- 
past over, they adjourned to the drawing-room, and 
conversed. As the clock struck eight, Villemain's three 
little daughters entered to kiss their father good night. 
The youngest is named Lucette; she is a sweet and 
charming child of five years. ' Well, Lucette, dear 
child,' said her father, ' won't you recite one of Lafon- 
taine's fables before you go to bed ?' ' Here,' observed 
M. de Salvandy, 'is a little person who to-day recites 
fables and who one of these days will inspire romances.' 
Lucette did not understand. She merely gazed with 
big, wondering eyes at Salvandy, who was lolling in his 
chair with an air of benevolent condescension. ' Well, 
Lucette,' he went on, ' will you not recite a fable for 
us ? ' The child required no urging, and began in her 
naive little voice, her fine, frank eyes still fixed upon

Under the date April 22, 1847, we find re- 
corded in M. Hugo's notes the election to the 
Academy of M. Ampere : 

" This is an improvement upon the last. A slow im- 
provement. But Academies, like old people, go slowly. 
During the session and after the election, Latnartitie 
sent me by an usher the following lines: 
'C"esf tin ttat peu protpfre 
D'aller d'Empit en Ampere.' 

I replied to him by the same usher: 
' Toutffois ce strait pis 
Waller d 1 Ampere en Empis.' " 

In his series of " Sketches made in the Na- 
tional Assembly," Victor Hugo draws a not too 
flattering portrait of Thiers. 

" M. Thiers wants to treat men, ideas, and revolution- 
ary events with parliamentary routine. He plays his 
old game of constitutional tricks in face of abysms and 
the dreadful upheavals of the chimerical and unex- 
pected. . . . All his life he has been stroking cats, 
and coaxing them with all sorts of cajoling processes 
and feline ways. To-day he is trying to play the same 
game, and does not see that the animals have grown 
beyond all measure and that it is wild beasts that he is 
keeping about him. A strange sight it is to see this 
little man trying to stroke the roaring mussle of a revo- 
lution with his little band. ... I have always enter- 
tained towards this celebrated statesman, this eminent 
orator, this mediocre writer, this narrow-minded man, 
an indefinable sentiment of admiration, aversion, and 
disdain." 

The sketch of Lamartine conveys that poet's 
own opinion of some of his political colleagues 
(1850). 

11 During the session Lamartine came and sat beside 
me in the place usually occupied by M. Arbey. While 
talking, he interjected in an undertone sarcastic remarks 
about the orators in the tribune. Thiers spoke. ' Little 
scamp,' murmured Lamartine. Then Cavaignac made 
his appearance. ' What do you think about him? ' said 
Lamartine. 'For my part, these are my sentiments: 
He is fortunate, he is brave, he is loyal, he is voluble 
and he is stupid.' ... A moment later Jules Favres

ascended the tribune. ' I do not know how they can 
see a serpent in this man,' said Lamartine. ' He is a 
provincial academician.' Laughing the while, he took 
a sheet of paper from my desk, asked me for a pen, asked 
Savatier-Laroche for a pinch of snuff, and wrote a few 
lines. This done, he mounted the tribune and addressed 
grave and haughty words to M. Thiers, who had been 
attacking the revolution of February. Then he returned 
to qur bench, shook hands with me while the Left ap- 
plauded and the Right waxed indignant, and calmly 
emptied the snuff in Savatier-Laroche's snuffbox into 
his own." 

The author's account of the siege of Paris, 
as he saw and endured it, is decidedly interest- 
ing, and is made up of extracts from note- books, 
private and personal notes jotted down from day 
to day. On the whole, the volume is a rich and 
entertaining one not, in form and tenor, just 
what we expected and hoped to find it, but never- 
theless one which amply repays perusal.

MR. FISKE'S "DUTCH AND QUAKER 
COLONIES."* 

The latest addition to Mr. John Fiske's 
popular historical series is plainly marked by 
the well-known characteristics of its author 
wide reading, affluence of interesting facts and 
ideas, firm grasp of materials, great literary 
skill, fondness for episodes, keen enjoyment of 
the picturesque, much ingenuity in hypothesis 
and explanation, proneness to generalization, 
ardent Americanism, and greater conformity to 
truth in the picture than in the single stroke. 
Still further, no subject that occurs in the series 
is better suited to his peculiar genius than the 
Dutch and Quaker Colonies ; perhaps no other 
is so well suited to it. Until recently, and even 
now in diminished degree, the larger sources 
of interest in our early history have been found 
in Virginia and New England particularly 
in New England, for the reason in part, no 
doubt, that New England writers have con- 
tributed more than any other group of writers 
to our historical scholarship and literature ; but 
discerning men are now coming to see that, if 
the two great middle colonies exerted less po- 
litical influence down to the Revolution than 
Virginia and Massachusetts, they nevertheless 
possess abundant elements that have an interest 
of their own. From the point of view fur- 
nished by the word " people," Massachusetts 
and Connecticut, and even Virginia, are tame 
and monotonous compared with Pennsylvania

ton, Mifflin & Co. 



or even with New York. The population of 
New England and Virginia, being almost purely 
English, was much more homogeneous than 
that of the English colonies ; the main stream 
of political development or progress ran far 
straighter and deeper ; they were much better 
fitted for political leadership when a national 
sentiment began to show itself, which leader- 
ship they naturally assumed ; and for these very 
reasons, or at least for some of them, they are 
less picturesque and poetic than New York and 
Pennsylvania. Even elements in these colonies 
that are dull in themselves become interesting 
when studied in combination. Such is Mr. 
Fiske's opportunity, and he makes the most of 
it. Whatever may have been his previous 
view, no intelligent reader of the work is likely 
to lay it down thinking that either it or the 
subject is dull and uninteresting. 

The stereotyped phrase " the author plunges 
at once into his subject " will not apply in this 
case. The Introduction proper is two chapters, 
" The Mediaeval Netherlands " and " Dutch In- 
fluence upon England," together comprising 57 
pages. While both chapters are interesting 
and throw needed light upon the subject, the 
introduction seems out of proportion to the 
body of the work, especially as it has no direct 
bearing upon the history of Pennsylvania. The 
author lingers too long in the index. He does 
not bring Peter Minuet to Manhattan until 
page 120 is reached. 

At the beginning of the second chapter, we 
are glad to find Mr. Fiske setting right those 
good people who have accepted the crude gener- 
alizations propounded by Mr. Douglass Camp- 
bell in his well-known book, "The Puritan in 
England, Holland, and America." Consider- 
ing the undeniable facts that, collectively, the 
Thirteen Colonies were English colonies, and 
that the core of the American people has al- 
ways been English, the proposition that their 
most characteristic institutions are nevertheless 
Dutch is, on the face of it, a bold one ; but such 
is the love of novelty and paradox, of bold 
generalization and confident assertion, strength- 
ened in this case, according to our author, by 
patriotic bias on the one hand and anglophobia 
on the other, that it has still obtained consider- 
able currency. And this notwithstanding the 
plain fact that there was less of democracy and 
more of autocracy in New Netherland than in 
any one of the English colonies. Mr. Fiske very 
properly tells us that, in such matters, it is im- 
portant to remember the difference between 
vost hoc and propter hoc; and he illustrates it 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



by the conclusive refutation of one of the main 
arguments by which Mr. Campbell supported 
his thesis. 

" For example, if in the sixteenth century we find 
free public schools in operation in the Netherlands but 
not in England, we must beware of too hastily inferring 
that the free schools of New England in the seven- 
teenth century were introduced or copied from Holland. 
A different explanation is quite possible. One of the 
cardinal requirements of democratic Calvinism has 
always been elementary education for everybody. In 
matters of religion all souls are equally concerned, and 
each individual is ultimately responsible for himself. 
The Scriptures are the rule of life, and accordingly 
each individual ought to be able to read them for him- 
self, without dependence upon priests. Hence it is one 
of the prime duties of a congregation to insist that all 
its members shall know how to read, and if necessary 
to provide them with the requisite instruction. In ac- 
cordance with this Calvinistic idea some form of uni- 
versal and compulsory elementary education sprang up 
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wherever 
Calvinism had become dominant, in the Protestant 
parts of France and Switzerland, in Scotland, in the 
Netherlands, and in New England. Obviously, then, 
it might be held that free schools in New England were 
a natural development of Calvinism, and do not neces- 
sarily imply any especially close relation with Holland." 

Mr. Fiske by no means denies that the Dutch 
exerted an influence upon America indirectly 
through England and directly through New 
Netherland ; on the contrary, he concedes so 
much influence that, in fact, he sometimes en- 
dangers his own distinction between post and 
propter. However, the question is one of a 
very difficult class of questions that can be 
answered only in general terms, and men will 
differ about them. 

One of the most interesting passages to the 
student of political history is that in which the 
author points out that while Englishmen in 
America rose superior to their former political 
level in England, Dutchmen fell below theirs 
in Holland, and then states his explanation of 
the curious phenomena. We can only draw 
attention to the passage, and pass on. 

In Nornmbega, Mr. Fiske finds one of those 
side topics that never fail to fascinate him. He 
devotes to it ten pages. The region, the river, 
and the town that bear the name " Norumbega" 
roll about the sixteenth century maps in a way 
to discourage attempts at locating them ; but 
Mr. Fiske, with his usual love of solutions, 
happily succeeds in placing them all. The re- 
gion gives him little trouble ; but not so the 
river and the town. He follows Mr. Weise in 
identifying the river with the Hudson, and 
Mercator in placing the town on Manhattan 
Island. As respects the town, it would seem 
as though this were sufficiently definite for 



what is at most little more than a will-o'-the- 
wisp ; but it does not satisfy our author. 

* We further learn that the French Fort of Norom- 
begue was situated on a small island [or partly sub- 
merged isthmus] in a lake upon the island of Manhattan. 
In other words, it was a little north of the present City 
Hall. The lake, which the Dutch used to call some- 
times the Collect, sometimes the Fresh Water, was a 
familiar feature in New York until after the present 
century had come in. John Fitch used it for experi- 
ments with a small steamboat in 1796." 

We are then told that " the subject is not one 
which admits of dogmatic assurance." 

The same chapter furnishes a second exam- 
ple of the author's love of episodes. As intro- 
ductory to his narrative of Henry Hudson and 
his discoveries, he gives a lengthy account of a 
group of men in London, some of them con- 
nected with the Muscovite Company, whose 
names are spelled Hudson, Herdson, and some 
thirty other ways. The question is whether 
the great navigator belongs to this family, if 
indeed they constitute a family. 

" Into the relationships of these worthies we can go 
just far enough to be tantalized, for in matters of gen- 
ealogy a miss is as bad as a mile; but there are fair 
grounds for believing them all to have been kinsmen. 
It has been conjectured that Henry Hudson the Navi- 
gator was the grandson of Alderman Hudson." 

So a " conjecture " only comes out of the " tan- 
talizing" inquiry. Why, then, give so much 
space to it ? This is the answer : 

" We learn from documents collected by Hakluyt 
that it was a custom for members of the Muscovy 
Company to apprentice their children to the art of navi- 
gation for the Company's service. It therefore seems 
highly probable that Henry Hudson, as member of a 
family which had already for two generations been de- 
voted to the interests of British navigation, had grown 
up in the employ of the Company." 

The custom of the members of the company is 
an interesting one, and we should be glad to 
know that Henry Hudson was bred up in such 
a service ; but even Mr. Fiske, at the beginning 
of his inquiry, finds the word " conjecture " 
strong enough to express his faith, although he 
reaches " highly probable " in the end, in what 
is at best but a " tantalizing inquiry." 

We regret to see that Mr. Fiske has not 
looked into schools and education in New York 
and Pennsylvania as carefully as he had pre- 
viously done in New England and Virginia. 
This is the more to be regretted because it is 
not so very long ago that educational circles 
were somewhat agitated by the question of the 
relative merits of Massachusetts and New 
York in public school pioneering. He treats 
of schools in the United Netherlands, but we 
do not recall a word in regard to schools in 



1899.]

New Netherland. He deals with Van der Donck 
and his associates, but does not mention the 
significant words concerning a public school 
that they inserted in the " Reasons and Causes," 
etc., that they caused to be sent to Amsterdam. 
He does full justice to the Quaker indifference 
to higher education, and assigns it to its proper 
cause ; which is an admirable example of the 
practical efficacy of theological opinions. 

" In spite of their liberalism, the Quakers attached 
far less importance to education than the Puritans of 
New England. The majority of their preachers and 
instructors were men of high moral tone and spiritual 
insight with scant learning, like George Fox himself. 
Fox used to say that ' God stood in no need of human 
learning,' and that ' Oxford and Cambridge could not 
make a minister.' Quakers, in studying the Bible, de- 
pended upon their Inner Light rather than that critical 
interpretation of texts to which the orthodox Puritans 
attached so much importance. A knowledge of Hebrew, 
therefore, was not highly valued; and as for Greek and 
Latin literature, it was the unsanctified work of pagans, 
while the poets of France and Italy dealt with worldly 
and frivolous themes. In these respects we must re- 
member that Penn was as far from being a typical 
Quaker as Milton, with his pervading artistic sense, his 
love of music and the theatre, and his long curling hair, 
was from being a typical Puritan. George Fox and 
John Cotton are respectively the typical men. The 
latter, who spent twelve hours a day in study, and said, 
' I love to sweeten my mouth with a piece of Calvin 
before I go to sleep,' could write and speak fluently in 
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, besides carrying a ponderous 
burden of philological, metaphysical, and theological 
erudition. Among the Puritan divines of New England, 
real scholarship was commonly found, and it was some- 
times of a high order; and this was because sound 
scholarship was supposed to be conducive to soundness 
in doctrines. This explains the founding of Harvard 
College in the wilderness in 1636. 

11 To the Quaker, whose mind was directly illuminated 
by light from above, this elaborate equipment was mere 
rubbish. It was, therefore, not strange that in colonial 
times the higher education in Pennsylvania owed little 
to Quakers." 

Still, it must be said that not all the early 
Quakers were obscurantists as respects the 
higher education ; such men as Barclay, author 
of the " Apology," Ellwood, who read the 
classics to Milton in his blindness, and Penn 
himself had a genuine love of learning. Mr. 
Fiske adds that the Quakers were nevertheless 
careful, as people of practical sense, to teach 
their children the three R's, and speaks of the 
early schools of Philadelphia ; but he does not 
tell us that, although Penn strove to avert such 
a result, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, with the 
full control of the Assembly in their hands 
down to the Revolution, still never set up even 
the semblance of a public school system, which 
was really due to their religion, and so confirms 
the paragraph quoted above. On the other 



hand, the Dutch in New York, while by no 
means establishing a common-school system, 
did enough educational work to show that they 
were of the Calvinistic lineage. 

Nor can we think that Mr. Fiske does full 
justice to the Pennsylvania Germans. The 
German Bible that they published at German- 
town thirty-nine years before an English Bible 
had appeared in any one of the colonies, is just 
one of those facts that we should have ex- 
pected Mr. Fiske to pick up in his reading ; but 
he does not seem to have done so, or at least 
does not mention it. 

We close as we began : the book is thor- 
oughly characteristic of its author, and will be 
accounted one of the brilliant pieces of histor- 
ical writing of its period.

THREE-QUARTERS OF THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY.* 

Mr. John Sartain's u Reminiscences of a Very 
Old Man" cover the most magnificent period 
of the world's history; for surely never was 
more done for civilization than during a life 
which includes the years from 1808 to 1897. 

Mr. Sartain was born in London, and there 
spent his youth. His keen memory runs back 
to his sixth year, when he was carried by his 
father to the Peace Jubilee of 1814, to view 
the gay scenes by day and the fireworks at 
night. And then to school. Why children 
were sent to such cruel masters one of Sar- 
tain's was Tom Crib, ex- champion pugilist of 
England stands as a mystery to us to-day. 
By the time the lad was ten years old, flogging 
not for demerit, but on the principle laid 
down by Solomon had so embittered him with 
school that nothing could induce him to go fur- 
ther with it. His life-work began two years 
later. While digging in a trench in a neigh- 
bor's garden, overlooked by the laboratory of 
the Italian pyrotechnist and scene-painter 
Mortram, that worthy's attention was attracted 
to the vigorous manner in which young Sartain 
was handling his shovel the truth being that 
the boy was in a fit of temper at the time. 
Mortrarn bespoke the services of so diligent an 
assistant, and Sartain went to work for him. 

Among other things, Mortram was in charge 
of the department of " steam, smoke, and fire " 
at Charles Kemble's play-house, the Theatre

Royal, Covent Garden; and the life with him 
was hard but not monotonous. The boy was 
in daily contact with the popular players of the 
day, Farren, Abbott, Mrs. Chatterton, Mr. and 
Mrs. Fawcett, and the accomplished songstress 
Miss Stephens, who was to become Countess of 
Essex. Occasionally Kemble's lovely daughter 
Fanny was to be seen by the admiring lad, but 
she was too young for any professional connec- 
tion with the theatre. Always fond of his 
pencil, it was behind the scenes that Sartain's 
abilities obtained their first recognition, Mort- 
rain sending him to make a sketch of the 
" White Horse Cellar " in Piccadilly, a view of 
which was wanted for a piece in rehearsal. 

Though sufficiently contented with his work 
under Mortrara, after various changes John 
Sartain was apprenticed, at the age of fourteen, 
to John Swaine, in order to learn the art of 
engraving. The work was purely commercial, 
cutting names on door-plates, dog-collars, 
and the like. But William Young Ottley 
chanced to see some scraps of line-work from 
the boy's hand, and borrowed him from his 
master to aid him in completing a work begun 
thirty years before in Rome a piece of splen- 
did good-luck for his pupil. This was nothing 
less than "The Early Florentine School," a 
folio of engravings from the works of the 
masters of Florence, including examples of 
their best compositions during two centuries 
and a half. Ottley was known not only as a 
most learned antiquary in art matters but as 
an accomplished artist, and within the year 
Sartain had engraved three plates throughout, 
two after Bennozo Gossoli and the third after 
Giotto. This work, naturally congenial, was 
performed in Ottley 's gallery, amid surround- 
ings which were in themselves an education. 

Mr. Sartain presently returned to Swaine 
and his task-work, but was permitted to take 
orders outside, and finally succeeded in buying 
off the rest of his time. He then became the 
pupil of Richter for eight months, escaping 
from that taskmaster with considerable diffi- 
culty to set up for himself, engraving fancy 
subjects on order from publishers, but finding 
his greatest profit in individual portraits. The 
chance meeting with a young engraver in stip- 
ple, who urged going to America, turned Sar- 
tain's thoughts in that direction ; and, after 
marrying the daughter of Swaine, he embarked 
for Philadelphia July 4, 1830, taking with him 
an abundance of letters of introduction. 

After satisfying himself that a livelihood was 
obtainable in Philadelphia, and being greatly 



encouraged thereby, Sartain went to New York 
and delivered his letters there. Among many 
others he met Sully, the portrait painter, who 
was warm in his commendation of Penu's capi- 
tal, and urged him to settle there, at the same 
time giving him his portrait of Bishop White 
to engrave. With orders from Henry C. Carey 
and Thomas T. Ash, both publishers, and from 
John Neagle the artist, as well, success was 
already assured a man of Sartain's abilities, 
and he henceforth reckoned Philadelphia as his 
home. There are interesting tales of his fellow- 
artists, and of the somewhat deplorable con- 
dition of the Academy of Fine Arts in Chestnut 
street; and we are reminded that Rebecca, the 
beautiful daughter of Herman Gratz, for many 
years Sartain's colleague on the board of the 
Academy, was the original of the Rebecca in 
Sir Walter Scott's " Ivanhoe," Washington 
Irving having told the great novelist of her 
many beauties of mind and body. 

In January, 1841, George R. Graham pub- 
lished the first number of "Graham's Maga- 
zine. " One of its features was an original 
engraving from Sartain's hand, a new plate to 
accompany each number. The success of the 
enterprise was a surprise to Graham himself, 
and it brought him so many offers to engage 
in enticing schemes that he soon left the 
magazine to run itself. As a result, in 1848 
everything was sold to satisfy his creditors, 
leaving the engraver the opportunity to begin 
the publication of "Sartain's Union Magazine." 

For eighteen months Edgar Allan Poe was 
assistant editor of "Graham's Magazine," with 
a salary of eight hundred dollars a year ; and 
there is nothing in the book of more interest 
than the intimacy which grew up between Sar- 
tain and Poe. This lasted through the estab- 
lishment of the " Union Magazine," and many 
of Poe's most notable works found publication 
in its pages, " The Bells " among others. Mr. 
Sartain tells us that "Annabel Lee" was the 
last poem Poe ever wrote. It was bought for 
his periodical, but before publication it was 
found that it had already been sold to three 
other publishers. A most unhappy glimpse of 
the poet's compounded misfortunes is told in 
these words: 

"The last time I saw Mr. Poe was late in 1849, and 
then under such peculiar and almost fearful conditions 
that the experience can never fade from my memory. 
Early one Monday afternoon he suddenly entered my 
engraving room, looking pale and haggard, witli a wild 
and frightened expression in his eyes. I did not let 
him see that I noticed it, and shaking him cordially by 
the hand invited him to be seated, when he began, ' Mr. 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

Sartain, I have come to you for a refuge and protec- 
tion; will you let me stay with you? It is necessary 
to my safety that I lie concealed for a time.' I assured 
him that he was welcome, that in my house he would 
be perfectly safe, and that he could stay as long as he 
liked, but asked him what was the matter. . . . After 
he had had time to calm down a little, he told me that 
he had been on his way to New York, but he had over- 
heard some men who sat a few seats back of him plotting 
how they should kill him and then throw him from the 
platform of the car. He said they spoke so low that 
it would have been impossible for him to hear and un- 
derstand the meaning of their words, had it not been 
that his sense of hearing was so wonderfully acute. 
They could not guess that he heard them, as he sat so 
quiet and apparently indifferent to what was going on, 
but when the train arrived at the Bordentown station 
he gave them the slip and remained concealed until 
the cars moved on again. He had returned to Phila- 
delphia by the first train back, and hurried to me for 
refuge." 

Mr. Sartain tried to reassure his guest by tell- 
ing him that he had imagined all these things. 
He did more : he took Poe home with him, gave 
him his slippers to take the place of shoes too 
much worn for further service, and after sup- 
per took him out to walk. Poe was at the point 
of suicide, and in no respect his own master. 
While they were together that evening, others 
of the poet's imaginary experiences were con- 
fided to his friend, one of them in this language, 
as nearly as Mr. Sartain can recollect it: 

" ' I was confined to a cell in Moyamensing Prison, 
and through my grated window was visible the battle- 
mented granite tower. On the topmost stone of the 
parapet, between the embrasures, stood perched against 
the sky a young female brightly radiant, like silver 
dipped in light, either in herself or her environment, 
so that the cross-bar shadows thrown from my window 
were distinct on the opposite wall. From this position, 
remote as it was, she addressed to me a series of ques- 
tions in words not loud but distinct, and I dared not 
fail to hear and make response. Had I failed once 
either to hear or to make pertinent answer, the con- 
sequences to me would have been something fearful; 
but my sense of hearing is wonderfully acute, so that I 
passed safely through this ordeal, which was a snare to 
catch me.' " 

These imaginings of Poe are told at great 
length, and are all of the same character. 
Sartain kept the perturbed spirit with him un- 
til rest and good food had worked a partial 
recovery, when Poe resumed his interrupted 
journey to New York. Sartain never saw him 
again. Within a month he lay dead in the 
hospital at Baltimore. Of the last days of 
Edgar Allan Poe on earth, Sartain has this to 
say a statement which contradicts much that 
has been written of him, notably the memoir 
of Professor Woodbury : 

" In those [last] few weeks how much had happened, 
and how hopeful seemed the prospects for his future. 



He [Poe] had joined a temperance society, delivered 
lectures, resumed friendly relations with an early flame 
of his, Mrs. Sarah E. Shelton, and become engaged to 
her. Dr. John J. Moran, who attended the poet in his 
last moments, says that Poe parted from her at her 
residence in Richmond at four in the afternoon of Oct- 
ober 4, 1849, to go north. She states that when he 
said ' good-bye ' he paused a moment as if reflecting, 
and then said to her, ' I have a singular feeling amount- 
ing to a presentiment, that this will be our last meeting 
until we meet to part no more,' and then walked slowly 
and sadly away. Reaching the Susquehanna, he refused 
to venture across because of the wildness of the storm- 
driven water, and he returned to Baltimore. Alighting 
from the cars, he was seen to turn down Pratt street on 
the south side, followed by two suspicious looking char- 
acters as far as the south-west corner of Pratt and 
Light streets. A fair presumption is that they got him 
into one of the abominable places that lined the wharf, 
drugged him, and robbed him of everything. After 
daybreak, on the morning of the sixth, a gentleman 
found him stretched unconscious upon a broad plank 
across some barrels on the sidewalk. Recognizing him, 
he obtained a hack and gave the driver a card with Mr. 
Moran's address on it and on the lower right-hand cor- 
ner the name of ' Poe.' 

" At the hospital he was disrobed of the wretched 
apparel which had been exchanged for his good clothing 
of the day before, and he was put comfortably to bed. 
After consciousness returned the doctor said to him, 
'Mr. Poe, you are extremely weak; pulse very low; I 
will give yon a glass of toddy.' He answered, ' Sir, if 
I thought its potency would transport me to the Elysian 
bowers of the undiscovered spirit world, I would not 
take it.' Then I will give you an opiate to ensure you 
sleep and rest.' He replied, ' Twin sister-spectre to the 
doomed and crazed mortals of earth and perdition.' 
The doctor records he found no tremor of his person, 
no unsteadiness of his nerves, no fidgetting with his 
hands, and not the slightest odour of liquor on his 
breath or person. Poe said after a sip or two of cold 
water, ' Doctor, it's all over.' Dr. Moran confirmed 
his belief that his end was near, and asked if he had any 
word or wish for his friends. He answered, ' Never- 
more,' and continued, < He who arched the heavens and 
upholds the universe has His decrees legibly written 
upon the frontlet of every human being and upon devils 
incarnate.' These were his last words, his glassy eyes 
rolled back, a slight tremor, and the immortal soul of 
Edgar Allan Poe passed into the spirit world, October 
7, 1849, aged thirty-eight. The accepted statement 
that Poe died in a drunken debauch is attested by Dr. 
Moran to be a calumny. He died from a chill caused 
by exposure during the night under a cold October sky, 
clad only in the thin old bombazine coat and trousers 
which had been substituted for his own warm clothing." 

Mr. Sartain has an interesting paragraph 
on the honoraria paid to authors while he was 
publishing his magazine. He says : 

" Longfellow never received less than fifty dollars 
each for his numerous articles. Horace Binney Wal- 
lace was paid forty dollars for his article on Washing- 
ton Irving, and Poe received forty-five dollars for ' The 
Bells.' In the form he first submitted it, consisting of 
eighteen lines of small merit, he received fifteen dollars; 
but after he had rewritten and improved it to a hun- 
dred and thirteen lines he was paid thirty dollars more. 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 r 



Poe received thirty dollars for his article on 'The 
Poetic Principle.' 

Dr. Bethune's four-page articles on ' Aunt Betsy ' 
brought him fifty dollars each. Nathaniel P. Willis 
and Joseph R. Chandler received fifty dollars each for 
their five or six page articles, and Francis J. Grand 
sixty-five dollars for his article on Kossuth. John Neal 
was paid twenty-five dollars for ' What is Poetry? ' and 
Professor Joseph Alden averaged thirty-five dollars for 
each of his contributions. Miss Brown and Edith and 
Caroline May averaged about ten or twelve dollars a 
poem, and William Do we was content to receive four 
dollars a page for his prose, a page holding nearly nine 
hundred words. Many poems of merit were printed 
that cost only five dollars each, it being well understood 
that the name is valued as well as the writing." 

Of a most interesting journey abroad in 
1863, of the founding of the art schools of the 
Pennsylvania Academy, of the part taken in 
the art collections of the Centennial Exposi- 
tion, and of many other matters which have 
left America greatly in John Sartain's debt, 
there is no room to speak. The book de- 
serves to be read as a whole. It is well 
written, delightfully illustrated, and an excel- 
lent compendium of art extending over many 
years. Mr. Sartain died in Philadelphia, uni- 
versally regretted, October 25, 1897.

A MAX OF THE THEOLOGICAL, RENAIS- 
SANCE IN NEW ENGLAND.* 

For a generation, the memory of Horace 
Bushnell has been held in reverence and grat- 
itude, perhaps all the deeper because so many 
of his own contemporaries saw in him so much 
of heresy and danger. Within a certain group 
of theologians, it is true, this prejudice still 
holds sway ; but its existence is a tribute to 
their own Philistine logic or " dodge," as 
Jowett called the process. As a matter of fact, 
there is probably not to-day an evangelical 
thinker who is genuinely modern that is, one 
who is moved by the scientific rather than the 
metaphysical impulse who would not find 
himself thoroughly in sympathy with Bush- 
nell's main positions. 

It is hard to imagine the New England out 
of which Bushnell sprang and whose closely- 
wrought theology he abandoned first as an ag- 
nostic before the Agnostics, and then as the 
representative of religious life rather than of 
dogma. Dr. Munger has admirably described 
the "New England theology" as it strove to 
44 improve " Edwards ; to rationalize a Hopkins-

ism whose shibboleth was one's willingness 
to be damned for the glory of God ; and, above 
all, to share in the incipient liberating move- 
ment of Coleridge without giving up the su- 
premacy of a logic " as faultless as unconvinc- 
ing." From all the algebra of the schools, Dr. 
Bushnell appealed to experience and life. God 
was something more to him than a dogma ; the 
Trinity, something more than a puzzle for 
metaphysicians ; and religion something more 
than tradition. At his best, he was not a logi- 
cian, and his least satisfactory thought is that 
in which, not yet able to break quite away from 
the spirit of his time, he deemed it necessary 
to use the methods of the formal thinker. In 
his own estimation, Bushnell's chief duty un- 
doubtedly lay in a re-statement of the current 
evangelicalism, from a different point of view 
and with a greater reliance upon the data fur- 
nished by nature and human experience. In 
reality, he started men toward the more help- 
ful and rational if less systematic theology that 
endeavors to re-shape religious teaching on a 
foundation broader than texts wrenched from 
any portion of the Scripture, and, whether 
poetry or vision or history or aspiration or 
oriental apalogue, treated like definitions cast 
in the mould of Aquinas or Calvin, and ar- 
ranged according to the inevitable processes of 
Aristotle. And therefore it was that he became 
the sweetening, broadening influence that he 
was and is, a man of the theological Renais- 
sance in New England. 

It is a matter of congratulation that Dr. 
Munger has told so fairly the story of Dr. 
Bushnell's life, with its struggles with zealous 
critics, and has discussed his teachings so sym- 
pathetically. For we are not without the dog- 
matist to-day, and popular theology is still in 
need of the emancipation and sanity and re- 
ligious fervor that speaks in Bushneirs treat- 
ises, and above all in his sermons.

Miss KATHARINE COMAN and Miss Elizabeth Kimball 
Kendall are the joint authors of " A History of England 
for High Schools and Academies" (Macmillan). The vol- 
ume is well fitted for the year's work in English history 
for which the more progressive of our secondary schools 
now provide, and meets the corresponding entrance 
requirements of a number of our universities. It is 
a balanced book of the modern type, so prepared as 
to encourage collateral reading and the study of the 
sources. The illustrations are numerous and chosen with 
fair judgment, although the selection of portraits is now 
and then questionable, as in the case of Mr. Labouchere. 
The maps, of which more than thirty are included, con- 
stitute a valuable educational feature of this wurk.

THE WAR WITH SPAIN, AND AFTER.* 

The later books dealing with the war with Spain 
and its results differ for the most part from those 
reviewed in THE DIAL soon after the cessation of 
hostilities. Nearly all the works having historical 
pretension make an honest attempt to deal fairly 
with the facts, omitting self-praise and commenting 
adversely upon some of the details of our conduct 
of the war, on the one side ; while on the other, a 
glittering imperialism leads to the bewilderment of 
history in the volumes dealing with the war at 
second-hand, and arguments strange to American 
ears are used to bolster up European ideas of colo- 
nies and conquests. 

Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge's account of " The War 
with Spain " exhibits him as an ardent partisan 
and a good hater, with but little of the historian's 
patience in research or capacity for impartiality. 
His book is sometimes violent, frequently unfair, 
and often untrue. He professes a seventh-day 
admiration for Great Britain which leaves us won- 
dering for his sincerity ; while in Spain he sees 
neither the gallant adversary nor the defeated foe, 
but rather the sum of all iniquities brought low 
by the decrees of Jehovah. His admiration for 
Great Britain he shares with admiration for Rear- 
Admiral Sampson, while his detestation of Spain 
includes a detestation of Rear-Admiral Schley. 
Holding a brief for the one, he does not scruple to 
write the other down, et suppressio veri et suggestio 
falsi being freely used to that end. The result is 
unhappy ; yet the book is so generally inaccurate 
that these things are merely incidental. By way of 
example, Mr. Lodge makes it appear (page 20) that 
President Cleveland was blameworthy for respecting 
the nation's treaty obligations with Spain in respect 
of filibustering ; he suppresses all mention of the 
representation of the Six Great Powers of Europe 
to President McKinley on April 7, 1898, though 
such action is as mischievous in its possibilities as 
it is unprecedented in our history ; he makes no 
mention of Spain's offer to arbitrate its differences 
with this country and our absolutely unexplained 
refusal of that request ; be quotes (page 31) Cap-

tain Sigsbee's mere surmise as positive proof that 
Spanish officials had guilty knowledge of the 
Maine's destruction ; he follows the new fashion of 
decrying the fathers of the country and the Decla- 
ration of Independence by calling the Congressional 
resolution " That the people of the Island of Cuba 
are, and of right ought to be, free and independent," 
" purely rhetorical " just as it was " when Richard 
Henry Lee first read it to the Continental Con- 
gress " (page 42) ; he invents (page 51) bright 
moonlight for the end of Admiral Dewey's voyage 
on the night of April 30, 1898, and, having invented 
it, is forced to invent a stoppage of the American 
squadron off Corregidor until the supposititious 
moon can set ; he blames (page 77) Congress, the 
people, and the press, for the scandals in the various 
bureaus of the War Department though he is 
careful not to mention what these were nor the fatal 
results which flowed from them when it is certain 
that it lay within the powers of the Chief Executive 
to do away with the cause of them ; he omits all 
statement of the outrageous nepotism which put the 
"sons of somebody" (a Spanish phrase) in positions 
for which they were unfitted ; he actually blames 
Schley (page 89, note) because Sampson did not 
furnish the Navy Department with a copy of the 
note in which he orders Schley to remain off Cien- 
fuegos ; he omits the date of Hobson's sinking the 
Merrimac ; he asserts an absolute untruth in saying 
that Sampson was within " easy signal distance " of 
the American ships throughout the battle of July 3 
(page 138), and so on, with blunders, embellishments, 
exaggerations, and untruths of the same sort on 
nearly every page. But those who recall the atti- 
tude of Mr. Lodge toward Great Britain, patent in 
his speeches in Congress and his previous books at 
all times, will wonder most at the comfort he can 
now extract from England's " old red ensign," now 
" looking very friendly and very welcome," and at 
his open advocacy of an alliance with that once 
detested power. He is seemingly unaware of that 
better English opinion, voiced by the poet upon our 
declaration of war, thus : 

" The sly Freebooters of the Earth 

Open their ranks, to welcome in 
The youngest Race God brought to birth, 
By serpent reasons lured to sin. 

" ' Peace and goodwill ' the promise failed 

As soon as made, erased with gore ; 
And once again the Christ is haled 
Behind the reeking wheels of war." 

Governor Roosevelt's account of his regiment, 
"The Rough Riders," is surcharged with that en- 
thusiasm which has characterized his public life. 
Other regiments have been more famous in history, 
but none illustrates so thoroughly the possibilities 
of modern newspaper advertisement as his. That 
it surpassed by even a little many of the other 
commands, both regular and volunteer, in any re- 
spect save in the publicity given its movements, no 
one is quicker to deny than its gallant colonel here ; 
that it did anything more than its duty, he is no less

eager to contradict ; yet this is the second or third 
large volume devoted exclusively to the history of 
this one regiment. Such chronicling certainly 
tends toward giving a disproportionate sense of 
even its great deserts, just as the stress laid upon 
its somewhat miscellaneous personnel is likely to 
leave the impression that American volunteer regi- 
ments generally are not taken from widely varied 
classes of which we used not to hear so much 
in the communities which send them forth. If the 
book does not err on the side of modesty, it is cer- 
tainly readable, and the men it celebrates deserve 
well at the hands of their countrymen. 

An admirable book in nearly all respects is the 
" Reminiscences of the Santiago Campaign " which 
Captain John Bigelow, U. S. A., has felt impelled to 
write. Brother to that Mr. Poulteney Bigelow 
whose patriotic outspokenness respecting the lack 
of preparation for the Santiago campaign earned 
the criticism of Mr. R. H. Davis and others, Cap- 
tain Bigelow is equally plain in his arraignment of 
the authorities for permitting this and other similar 
abuses. Yet he permits himself to be distracted 
from the real issue by holding the people to blame 
for the political appointments to military positions, 
advancing proof of this by showing that Congres- 
sional influence was generally at work. Similar 
attempts have been made to hold the former Secre- 
tary of War accountable for such errors. Unless 
we are to go to the point of a responsible min- 
istry and an impeccable head of the government at 
a breath, it requires nothing more than re-statement 
to show that the Chief Executive is constitutionally 
responsible in these cases, and not his subordinates 
and appointees, nor yet the Congress. The con- 
cluding chapter in the book is of great value, and 
Captain Bigelow should be listened to when he 
avers the possibility of increasing the efficiency of 
our regular army at least three-tenths, without 
adding to its numbers as so many seem eager 
to do in the face of all national tradition. 

Tom Hall, well known to the readers of the 
lighter magazines as a frequent contributor in both 
prose and verse, was adjutant of the First United 
States Volunteer Cavalry during the Cuban war. 
He supports Captain Bigelow by the relation of his 
experiences in Cuba, which he calls " The Fun and 
Fighting of the Rough Riders." The " fun," it is 
curious to relate, was afforded largely by the blun- 
ders of the regular soldiers under officers who, like 
Mr. Hall, were graduates of the Military Academy 
at West Point. He bears witness to the mass of 
inaccurate writing which has overwhelmed the his- 
tory of the Santiago campaign, saying: 

" Accounts agree on almost everything that happened 
in the campaign up to the morning of the 24th of June, 
1898, the day of the battle of Guasimas battle, skir- 
mish, surprise, ambush, glorious victory, waste of en- 
ergy, whichever the reader chooses to call it from his 
point of view. From this time on to the true*, ten days 
later, no two persons seem to agree. Heroism, Ability, 
Incompetence, Ambition, Jealousy, and their train of 



attendants, suddenly strode from the wings to the stage, 
and struggled for the centre and the rays of the lime- 
light. And no sooner did the curtain fall on the scene 
than the characters grabbed pen and ink and begaa 
writing about it. The result is a mass of historical data 
fairly appalling in its contradictory evidence. The ef- 
fect of all this upon the present scribe is such that he 
can look upon all history with a dubious smile and ex- 
claim at each volume, I wonder why you wrote this,' and 
' I wonder why you wrote that.' Men who saw little or 
nothing of the events of the next ten days have written 
the most surprising things, and men who were near 
enough to see have written absolutely amazing things 
about them. The campaign was a short one, but the 
history that records it will be a long one." 

Mr. Hall, at least, does not fear to tell the truth. 
His estimate of Guasimas can be told from the 
foregoing; 1 Caney he calls "a useless victory, 
won at an awful cost " ; and the siege of Santiago 
and the previous fighting are summarized in a preg- 
nant sentence : " A siege without siege guns was 
the logical climax of a battle without tactics and a 
campaign without strategy." If the nation were 
not so slow to see that luck was the chief factor in 
American success in Cuba, military reform would 
be possible. 

A work of another sort, though no less interest- 
ing than the best of the others, " Our Conquests in 
the Pacific," is a reprint in book form of the letters 
sent to the New York " Sun " from May to Decem- 
ber, 1898, by its correspondent in the Philippines, 
Mr. Oscar King Davis. Reflecting as a matter of 
course the pronounced attitude toward the war 
which his paper identified itself with, Mr. Davis 
still gives estimates of the Filipino patriots which 
are highly encouraging to those advocating local 
self-government. It is interesting to be told that 
Major-General Wesley Merritt is not greedy for the 
sort of fame which is falling upon the shoulders of 
Major-General Otis. The author, it may be added, 
was one of the men who protested recently against 
the latter officer's suppression and distortion of news. 

Calm, dispassionate, and statistical, Mr. William 
Dinwiddie still depends largely upon profuse illus- 
tration to make his work on Porto Rico attractive. 
The fourth or fifth of recent works treating of this 
island, it is by much the most inclusive. Here, 
too, the actions of the American authorities is sub- 
jected to searching criticism, as in the case of 
Major-General Miles's startling decree fixing the 
value of the native peso at fifty cents American. 
Yet he permits the attitude of the Chief Executive 
in leaving the ports of the island to remain closed 
against American imports, and the ports of the 
United States to remain similarly closed against 
Porto Rican exports, to pass without animadversion. 
Nothing is said, except in the most general terms, 
of the distress resulting, which was already acute 
when the summer hurricane brought the suffering 
to the point of agony. 

"The New- Born Cuba" of Mr. Franklin Ma- 
thews differs from the preceding volume in being

largely the work of a newspaper man who is report- 
ing the condition of the island during the first sixty 
days of American occupation as seen through the 
eyes of the officials in charge of its new destinies. 
The author evidently believes that the Congressional 
resolution which pledges the United States to take 
possession of the island for no longer time than 
will suffice " for the pacification thereof " should 
be interpreted to mean " for the permanent pacifi- 
cation thereof " which will, of course, mean any- 
thing the Administration chooses to have it mean. 
Deriving his impressions from the military men in 
harge of Cuba, his report is exceedingly favorable 
to the work they have done, which, indeed, appears 
to have been excellently well done for the most 
part. He bears ample testimony to the fact that 
there is no disorder throughout the extent of Cuba 
at this time, and is frank enough to report those 
American generals correctly who believe in with- 
drawing now, and leaving its inhabitants to work 
out their own salvation like the rest of Latin 
America. 

Doctor Griffis's "America in the East" is an 
intelligent but not too accurate summary of what 
the United States has stood for in China, Japan, 
and Hawaii, overlaid with much special pleading for 
the conquest of the Philippines in order that the 
archipelago may be joined to our national domain. 
The annexation of Hawaii is gloried in, of course, 
distrustful as it must make the world of the dis- 
interestedness of the American missionary. All 
our historical precedents are passed by, of necessity, 
in order to uphold the policy which is to give us 
"empire." Holding that the tropics are not to be 
exploited by the white man at the brown man's 
expense, the author still appeals to the conduct of 
the English and Dutch in eastern countries in justi- 
fication of our own highhandedness. Mr. Benja- 
min Kidd's " Control of the Tropics " is quoted 
approvingly up to the moment his argument be- 
comes effective, then ignored in favor of intangi- 
bilities. History is defied in the surprising theory 
that "responsibilities bring with them the capacity 
for meeting them," and the case of President 
Arthur is cited against the awful object-lessons of 
American misconduct in Alaska and Hawaii, as in 
our national dealings with the Indian and the Negro, 
which show this to be the most pitiable and con- 
temptible of fallacies. It is a pity that it should 
be obligatory here, in the face of Dr. Griffis's other 
works, to pronounce such a judgment, but this last 
book of his is a specious appeal away from historical 
facts and American ideals to the least worthy preju- 
dices of evangelical Christianity. 

Doctor Draper, in his book on " The Rescue of 
Cuba," follows in the same uneasy path. He extols 
the war with Spain as a precedent in favor of liberty, 
humanity, and justice, ignoring completely and 
conveniently the precedents to the contrary estab- 
lished by the war of conquest now waging against 
our truculent fellow-citizens, the Tagalos, or by the 
payment of tribute to our new suzerain, the Sultan 



of Sulu. This leads the author, when he comes to 
discuss imperialism, to limit the objections of those 
who stand upon the uniform precedents of the 
United States up to the moment of the sinking of 
Montojo's fleet to a single brief paragraph, while 
he sets forth with evident approval some pages of 
arguments favoring a completion of the conquest 
which Spain had found impossible. He urges that 
" the capture of a seat of government ... is con- 
sidered to carry with it the territory of which it 
is the capital city," though Washington was as 
ignorant of this during the Revolutionary war, so 
far as Boston, New York, or Philadelphia was con- 
cerned, as Madison was in respect of the city of 
Washington or the Canadians of the city of York 
in the war of 1812, or the Confederates concerning 
Richmond in the Civil war, or the Spanish respect- 
ing Havana or San Juan de Puerto Rico in the war 
just past. After such a misreading of history as 
that, one expects to find German spoliation of French 
territory advanced as a valid precedent for Ameri- 
cans to follow. This is the first of a series of 
European examples which we belated Americans 
are urged to emulate : the islands are rich and un- 
developed, so it is our duty to develop them, regard- 
less of compulsory native or coolie labor. The 
islands must be occupied for military purposes and 
"to enlarge our power upon the seas," a power 
which will not require enlargement if we leave them 
to their occupants. The islands must be ours so 
that we can spread the gospel among the heathen 
or Roman Catholics, as in Mexico the good 
doctor forgetting that he has shown just before, in 
treating of the Carolines, that this result was there 
effected by simple treaty. The islands must be 
ours because civil turmoil would ensue upon our 
withdrawal, our present administration of them 
apparently leaving nothing to be desired in this 
respect. The islands must become American be- 
cause " we are bound to establish free institutions 
where American soldiers have, against armed re- 
sistance, carried the American flag" as prepos- 
terous an argument as was ever used to bolster a 
bad cause, being absolutely disproved by our sensi- 
ble refusal to attempt any such thing in the Bar- 
bary States, in Canada, in Mexico, and in numerous 
minor instances of the same sort extending over 
our entire national history. Then comes the curious 
statement that our policy up to the present time, the 
policy under which we have acquired our one great- 
ness in a national reputation for generosity and 
peacefulness, is finally outgrown, and "the time has 
come when our national interests require we shall 
take our place among the nations and assume our 
part in managing the affairs of the whole world," 
with a great deal more about " obeying the impulses 
of our Saxon, Dutch, and Norman blood" (why 
not our Quaker and other Christian blood?) ; and 
the most extraordinary statement of all, that we 
ought to hold the Philippines because continental 
Europe in general and Great Britain in particular 
wish us to ! Shades of the Fathers ! was Washing-

WALLACE RICK. 



Mr. Bulltn'i 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

We see no reason for the excessive 
" 'umbleness " manifested by Mr. 
Frank T. Bullen in the preface to 
his new book, " The Log of a Sea-Waif " ( Apple- 
ton). Mr. Bullen starts out by meekly kotowing 
to certain sea-writers, all but one of whom are, as 
such, in almost every respect his own inferiors ; and 
he then indignantly asks himself, " Who, then, are 
you, that pretends to compete with these master 
magicians?" Not content with this immodest ex- 
hibition of modesty, he goes on to further abase 
himself by describing himself as one "permitted to 
cater for the reading public in sterling periodicals " 
by "the greatest kindness and indulgence on the 
part of men " (editors and publishers, we suppose) 
' holding high positions in the literary world " ; and 
he winds up by styling bis book the " autobiography 
of a nobody." " Please don't kick me," says the 
donkey in Sterne, " but if you will you may." Now 
is Mr. Bullen, a mariner who has sailed the brine 
for years and lived on "salt horse" for ever so 
many months at a stretch, still "fresh" enough to 
fancy that " kindness and indulgence " have anything 
at all to do with the appearance of his writings in 
" sterling periodicals," or that any publisher in the 
world would print his copy out of charitable motives ? 
If he does think so, we advise him earnestly to learn 
the ropes of his new calling with all possible speed, 
and we recommend Sir Walter Besant as a man 
from whom he can obtain some useful points in 
practical navigation. Perhaps, however, Mr. Mul- 
len's prefatory parade of humility is, as A. Ward 
used to say, "wrote sarkastikul "; and we hope it 
is. The book thus apologetically launched by Mr. 
Bullen is, to our thinking, in several important par- 
ticulars, and perhaps we may say on the whole, the 
best one he has yet given us. The best chapters 
that is to say, the really descriptive and truth- 
telling chapters in the capital "Cruise of the 
Cachalot " are better, mainly because newer and 
more picturesque, than any of the chapters in " The 
Log of a Sea- Waif." But the former book con- 
tained an objectionable element of melodrama and 
rather cheap sensationalism from which the latter 
is free. " The Log of a Sea- Waif " is strictly au- 
tobiographical, the plain narrative of the experiences 
of the first four years of the author's life as a sailor 
in the British merchant service, and therefore in 
some sort a British counterpart of the American 



of Shaketptart. 



Dana's "Two Years Before the Mast" for, it is 
perhaps needless to say, Mr. Bullen began at the 
bottom rung or, rather, ratline of the maritime 
ladder ; namely, as cabin-boy. His first ship was 
the " Arabella," bound for Demarara, a leaky old 
" hooker " (heavily insured, probably, by her thrifty 
owners) commanded by a skipper whone good-will 
toward Mr. Bullen took the painful form of beating 
nautical wisdom into his head with belay ing-pins, 
and seasoning his young " hide " against the stripes 
of fortune with rope's-ends, on the plan so splen- 
didly vindicated in the person of the immortal 
Bunsby. Subsequent voyages took Mr. Bullen to 
Havana, to Jamaica, back to London and Liver- 
pool, to Bombay, to Rangoon, to Melbourne, etc. 
The regular routine of the British merchant sailor's 
life is graphically and faithfully depicted, in good, 
plain English, and with a sufficient spice of wholly 
believable yet sufficiently stirring adventure, afloat 
and ashore. In short, Mr. Bullen's book is just 
the sort of one we hoped he would write ; and we 
trust that his " So long ! " at its close implies that 
it will be continued. There are eight illustrations. 

It will hardly be expected that we 
shall do complete justice to a new 
book on Shakespeare's Sonnets in a 
single short notice. We shall try to indicate one 
point only concerning Mr. Jesse Johnson's " Testi- 
mony of the Shakespearean Sonnets" (Putnam) 
which has hitherto prevented our accepting the the- 
ory presented in it. We think it necessary for any 
theory which would replace an accepted idea that 
it shall have less difficulty in the way of belief than 
the view it seeks to displace. The ordinary view 
of Shakespeare's sonnets presents some striking dif- 
ficulties, and Mr. Johnson calls our attention to 
some difficulties with which we have not been fa- 
miliar possible inconsistencies, internal and ex- 
ternal. But though such matters may make it 
harder to hold to our former conviction, they seem 
to us to pale in difficulty before the state of things 
which Mr. Johnson imagines in their stead. If Mr. 
Johnson be right, we must conceive a great poet 
writing plays and poems and giving them to the 
world under the name of somebody else of Will- 
iam Shakespeare with such perfect self-abnegation 
that no whisper of the real state of things reached 
the world. This is something quite inconsistent 
with our usual idea of a poet ; something that has 
not been known to happen since the world began. 
The case of Homer (if he were not the author of 
the Homeric poems) is not an analogy, nor the case 
of Chatterton, nor of Macpherson. nor of Ireland, 
nor of the letters of Junius, nor of Pope's Odyssey, 
nor of the Portuguese Sonnets, nor even the theory 
of the Baconian authorship. The only similar case 
we think of, and that in a minor way, is that of 
Sidney Carton in "A Tale of Two Cities." The 
idea has not the confirmation of analogy ; and be- 
ing on its face improbable, it offers a great difficulty 
to the sober-minded. That is no reason, however,

why it should not be held if necessary. But the 
only reason that it should be necessary to try to hold 
this difficult opinion is the difficulty of believing 
certain other matters of poetic psychology ; as, for 
instance, that the poet should call himself much 
older than his friend when really only nine years 
older (p. 37) ; that he should sometimes have 
thought of himself as old, past his prime, something 
of a failure, when only thirty or thirty-five years 
old (pp. 38-43) ; that, being of the temper we 
should infer from external evidence, he should ap- 
pear in his lyric poetry to be anxious, downcast, 
timid (p. 60) ; that he should have written these 
sonnets to the Earl of Southampton without any 
allusion to the brilliant circumstances of the latter's 
life (p. 80). These points, and others, do not seem 
so very difficult to us ; but whatever difficulty they 
have in Mr. Johnson's mind is of the same kind as 
the difficulty in our mind (and we should say in 
the mind of anyone else), attending the conception 
of a great unknown poet who allowed William 
Shakespeare to appropriate as his own the most re- 
markable works of literature. In other words, Mr. 
Johnson would do away with the usual conception 
by means which, if applied to his own idea, would 
sweep it forever from the memory even of mankind. 
Such and such things, he believes, could not have 
readily happened (although a true knowledge of 
almost any poet's mind would probably reveal a 
hundred parallel cases), and therefore he prefers to 
believe something so unheard of that if it had been 
the case it would be the only thing of its kind in 
the history of the world. This explanation of a 
difficult matter is far more difficult to conceive than 
the original difficulty itself. Mr. Johnson offers 
evidence which he says " would authorize a judg- 
ment in a court of a law." He may be right ; but 
we hardly think it would stand a severe examina- 
tion in a class in logic. 

Mr. Joel Benton's " In the Poe Cir- 
SySSyi, <** " (Mansfield and Wessels) is an 
attractively illustrated book made up 
of five essays which have appeared before in the 
magazines. It is a non-committal sort of book. 
The name does not commit the author to any espe- 
cial content, nor does the content commit him to 
any definite opinion. This point is rather note- 
worthy, because the book is chiefly a discussion of 
the relation of Poe's poetry to that of Dr. T. H. 
Chivers. Concerning Dr. Chivers, Mr. Benton has 
found and put together a good deal of interesting 
information, but he does not seem to have formed 
any definite opinion as to whether Poe or Chivers 
was the original of an element common to the work 
of both. This we rather regret. We think the fol- 
lowing lines in " The Vigil of Aiden " very like 
some in " The Raven ": 

" And that modest mild sweet maiden, 

In the Rosy Bowers of .Aiden, 

With her lily-lips love-laden, 

Answered, ' Yes ! f orevermore ! ' " 
In fact, they are so like that it seems clear to us 



that one of the poets copied from the other. " The 
Raven " was published in 1845 ; the volume by 
Chivers containing these lines was published in 
1851. Why present such a case, why speak of 
Chivers as a " precursor " of Poe, unless some ad- 
ditional matters can be alleged ? It will hardly be 
believed that Mr. Benton has nothing more to offer 
on this point. He has not : he merely quotes from 
the volume of Chivers, published in 1851 after 
Poe's death, and contents himself with suggesting 
vaguely that the poems may have been published 
previously in magazines, and that Poe may have 
seen them and so been inspired by Chivers. We note 
one passage only, although the case is much the 
same with many more. But on the facts presented 
by Mr. Benton, the inference is that in this one 
case Chivers copied Poe, and thus was a plagiarist, 
not a " precursor." And if he copied here, it adds 
to the probability (in the absence of direct evidence) 
that he did so in more doubtful cases. Mr. Benton, 
then, suggests that Poe was a plagiarist on grounds 
which show (unless something more be adduced) that 
he was plagiarized from. This is not a good thing 
to do. We might not care to hold a brief for Poe, 
but we do believe that to accuse him or anyone else 
of plagiarism, even by insinuation, on such absurd 
grounds as we have here, is, to say the least, unfor- 
tunate. If the charge is to be made, it should be 
definite and have at least some basis in fact : mere 
possibilities and vague suggestions should not be 
hurried into the magazines and then put between 
covers. Besides his view of Poe's relation to Chiv- 
ers, Mr. Benton has an idea on Baudelaire's rela- 
tion to Poe, of which some conception may be gained 
from his notion that in " Les Fleurs du Mai " 
Baudelaire " claimed to show that evil was not 
wholly without its better side, and that good is in 
some mysterious manner related to the whole scheme 
of things." Such was not our idea of the work in 
question, and we turned to it to see how the matter 
stood. But we have not been here won over to Mr. 
Benton's view, any more than in the case of Chivers. 

We have dawdled a good deal over 
Mr. C. F. Nirdlinger's "Masques 
and Mummers" (De Witt), which 
came out in the early summer, but on the whole it 
seems a bit more appropriate to speak of a book 
on the theatre at a time when one is going to the 
theatre than when one is not. We have already 
spoken in favor of books of collected theatrical 
criticism : we think that in itself the practice tends 
to give a better character to the current reporting 
of the doings on the stage. Now and then the 
criticism has rather lost its point because we can- 
not remember the things criticized, but this is not 
always so: in many cases the views expressed are 
in themselves as valuable as any other collected 
criticism. As may be surmised from his title, Mr. 
Nirdlinger is not an out-and-out admirer of the ac- 
tor's profession as such : he likes the drama, but 
the worship of the actor is not to his mind. His

views are certainly advanced, but we do not know 
that he goes farther than an intimate knowledge of 
the facts would naturally encourage if not warrant. 
We rather like some of his ideas as that actors 
should be anonymous, that there is no art of acting, 
that praise is not the whole and necessary duty of 
the critic. Despite some natural exaggeration, we 
imagine that much truth will here be found. When 
it comes to matters of the drama, we are sometimes 
inclined to differ with our author: we do not see 
that he shows a very keen sense of discrimination. 
In a large way, he is always right. It is right to 
see beauty in the romance of " Cyrano " and " The 
Prisoner of Zenda," and ugliness in the hypocrisy 
of Zaza " and The Christian." But we do not 
think that Mr. Nirdlinger is right in supposing that 
"truth though the heavens fall " is the art-shibboleth 
of Mr. Henry Arthur Jones ; nor, though we con- 
sider Mr. Pinero artistically honest (as far as he 
goes), do we consider him a man of keen vision or 
depth of thought Both are clever men for plays 
that will catch the attention of the educated theatre- 
goer, and neither is much more. We do not our- 
selves think that Seilor Echegaray goes very far 
beyond them. And when we speak of a lack of 
discrimination in Mr. Nirdlinger, it is because his 
essays do not bring out any greater qualities in 
Herr Hauptmann or M. Rostand than he perceives 
in the writers just mentioned. Still, it must be re- 
membered that these essays were not always written 
with a view to each other. Remarks which in view 
of any given play seemed quite clear, may easily 
seem a little out of focus when compared with 
something else. Mr. Nirdlinger's voice seems to 
us rather strident at times, a little affected at others; 
but his book has life enough to carry off many more 
drawbacks than those we have lightly touched upon, 
and many theatre-goers will be glad to see it. 

Those who recall the pleasant chatty 
reminiscences of Mr. Felix Mos- 
an<t mutida*. c heles which told an interested world 
of his youth with the late George Du Maurier, will 
find the same sort of entertainment in the later 
work, " Fragments of an Autobiography " (Harper). 
A painter by profession, and more particularly a 
painter of portraits, Mr. Moscheles has made him- 
self known and admired in England, Germany, and 
France, as well as in America. The son of an em- 
inent composer and godson of Felix Mendelssohn, 
the sketch of his career is a frank and charming 
view of artistic life at its best. With his music, his 
painting, and his earnest endeavors to move the 
world along tbe paths of peace, Mr. Moscheles is 
alike a subject for approval and emulation. The 
best view he gives of himself in his writings is not 
in but between the lines, where the man of the 
world, but still the man of enthusiasms and simple 
pleasures, speaks to his friend the reader. To 
Americans, not the least interesting of his reminis- 
cences will be the conversations he had with Mr. 
Grover Cleveland, just after the first election to the 



Tke mi' of 
the Boer* 
atflnl-hand. 



presidency. The painter takes no little credit to 
himself for suggesting to Mr. Cleveland his ideas 
of arbitration at that time, and holds, with appar- 
ently good reason, that the arbitration treaty with 
Great Britain, the failure of which with only too 
many other failures lies at the door of the Amer- 
ican Senate, was derived primarily from his sug- 
gestion at that time. To have been everywhere, to 
have seen everything, and to have known everyone, 
are prime requisites for writing an interesting book, 
if the writer be not unduly puffed up thereby. 
From this fault Mr. Moscheles is reasonably free, 
and we feel, after reading his Fragments " for the 
second time, that it is rather the celebrities who are 
under obligation to Mr. Moscheles than Mr. Mos- 
cheles who is under obligation to the celebrities. 
The value of the book is enhanced by portraits of 
several of the persons discussed, Browning and 
Mazzini with others, reproduced from his own paint- 
ings ; but we miss a picture of the autobiographer. 

Almost the first information the 
people of the United States have 
received from the Transvaal Re- 
public at first-hand comes in the pages of " Oom 
Paul's People" (Appleton), the result of a journey 
through South Africa made by Mr. Howard C. 
Hillegas of New York. For the first and almost 
tbe only time recently, the Boers are permitted to 
speak for themselves, instead of having their con- 
ceptions, ideals, ambitions, and practices misinter- 
preted by their enemies. The difference is striking. 
In habits, religions, and ideal.*, a strong similarity 
can be traced between the Boers and the New 
England colonies. The one book with which every 
citizen of the Transvaal is familiar is the Bible. 
His quotations from it, wrested into cant and 
hypocrisy in the same manner that the utter- 
ances of the Puritans were, are not only natural 
but inevitable, and the use of Scripture is no more 
done for effect than it was in Governor Sewall's 
Diary. It is the United States which affords Krue- 
ger and his advisers the ideals of government they 
hope to make their own, and they are sufficiently 
skilled historically to find a Paul Revere and a 
Boston Massacre in their own history. The Amer- 
icans resident in South Africa, with the exception 
of those wholly dependent upon the British mine- 
owners there, are uniformly with the Boers in their 
struggle, Mr. Hillegas says ; and the educational 
affairs of the Republic are largely in American 
hands. The Kimberley diamond mines, wrested 
from the Orange Free State with a forced payment 
of $450,000, have yielded $400,000,000 already. 
All the trouble over the Witwatersrandt is stated to 
be the result of Krueger's attempt to obtain for his 
own country a larger share of the mining profits. 
Significantly, much of the money has gone for the 
purchase of arms and the erection of fortifications. 
The book should be studied by everyone interested 
in the bloody and deplorable drama now being en- 
acted in South Africa.

An advanced Manv admirers of Mr. Bryce's 
text-book in "American Commonwealth" have 

civil government. w } 8 h e d that the work might be used 
as the standard text for instruction in our second- 
ary schools. To make such use practicable, the 
American publishers (Macmillan) some time ago 
prepared an abridged edition, and this they have 
now supplemented by publishing a volume called 
" Outlines of Civics," to be used in connection with 
the work of Mr. Bryce. This new volume is the 
work of Mr. Frederick H. Clark, and the only 
drawback to its general introduction into our schools 
is found in the fact that it is written with special 
reference to the institutions of a single State 
California. Other States would need to supple- 
ment it still further by special local material. The 
work is extremely well done. It provides lists of 
topics and works of reference, suggestive questions 
for investigation, and all the other apparatus needed 
for successful school work. It has, moreover, an 
introduction by Dr. George E. Howard, which puts 
things so admirably that we must find room for an 
extract. "In history, especially, the text -book 
maker and the teacher have usually aimed quite 
too low. In the attempt to simplify, they have 
written down or stooped to the supposed capacity 
of the pupil. Instead of putting the youth's facul- 
ties under a healthy strain, instead of lifting his 
thought to the highest possible level of attainment, 
the subject has been deliberately rendered juiceless 
and devoid of living interest, even when not made 
utterly distasteful. If this be a grave mistake in 
the historical field generally, it is positively inex- 
cusable in civics and civil government." We wish 
that these words might have the salutary effect of 
driving forever out of our schools the text-books 
still used in three-fourths of them. When such 
works as those of Messrs. Bryce, Fiske, and Hins- 
dale are to be had, it is positively criminal to use 
books of the discredited old-fashioned sort. 



Abraham Lincoln Mr - Cari Schurz, in an essay which 
as a Man of is a classic, pictures Mr. Lincoln as 

the People. a man u wno> preserving his homely 

speech and rustic manner even in the most con- 
spicuous position of that period, drew upon himself 
the scoffs of polite society, and then thrilled the 
soul of mankind with utterances of wonderful beauty 
and grandeur." The contrasts in this great life 
have often been noted, and people have wondered 
how this man of heroic mould could, for example, 
have opened the most serious discussion with the 
recounting of some story from the lower walks of 
life. In " Abraham Lincoln, the Man of the Peo- 
ple" (Macmillan), Mr. Norman Hapgood attempts 
to show how the common people furnished the in- 
spiration for a remarkable career. The familiar 
details of Mr. Lincoln's life are told again with 
many an anecdote here and there as the hero used 
them to illustrate his meaning. There is no claim 
to the discovery of any new material, but whatever 
of merit the book has rests on the underlying idea 



expressed in the title. In these days of iconoclasm, 
the Cromwellian theory of exact representation may 
be a desirable one ; but there are two ways of look- 
ing at a monument. The one who seeks ugly black 
spots under the shining surface may find them ; 
but such an observer would never realize the sig- 
nificance of the Bunker Hill shaft. In one sense 
Mr. Hapgood's idea of President Lincoln's life is 
attractive. The "homely speech and rustic man- 
ner " certainly were marked in the man who rose 
from the ranks of the common people, but no story 
of his life will be accepted by the average American 
as satisfactory, which does not emphasize most 
strongly the higher and grander elements of char- 
acter which make him belong to the ages. There 
is serious question whether this particular volume, 
read by young or old, will leave just the right im- 
pression of Abraham Lincoln. 

The literary Ifc is a gratifying evidence of healthy 

study of " interest in Biblical study, that Pro- 

the Bible. fessor Moulton's " Literary Study of 

the Bible " (D. C. Heath & Co.) should pass into a 
new edition. The " Modern Reader's Bible " has 
made some of the original treatise unnecessary, but 
the new edition still prints enough of the author's 
arrangement of the Biblical literature to illustrate 
his positions. As a means of awakening interest in 
the ancient literature of the Jews, " literary study " 
has a legitimate rdle to play ; but its chief value lies 
in its insistence upon the literary rather than the 
dogmatic point of view. Probably few specialists 
in the Old Testament would quite agree with all of 
Professor Moulton's arrangements, and the present 
understanding of Hebrew poetry is hardly sufficient 
to warrant any hard-and-fast decisions as to the 
correctness of many of his views as to strophes, 
anti-strophes, quatrains, and other forms. But his 
insistance that the literary character of a piece of 
scripture shall be determined before one interprets 
it, is certainly to be commended ; and it is here that 
the exegete will get help. What could be more 
astonishing or maddening than the assurance with 
which systematic theologians have made poetry do 
the work of philosophy, and rhapsody furnish 
premises for metaphysics ! The influence of Pro- 
fessor Moulton's book in counteracting such un- 
scientific methods is already great, and in its recon- 
structed form will doubtless be greater. 



Amateur and 



oratory. 



Books on rhetoric and English com- 
position, on debating, or extempo- 
raneous speaking, are apt to be of 
one sort or another : either too systematic and dry, 
or interesting enough but indefinite and desultory. 
The latter, so far as we have observed, is more 
commonly the case with books on public speaking ; 
and it is possible that the objection may be alleged 
against Dr. J. M. Buckley's "Extemporaneous 
Oratory for Professional and Amateur Speakers " 
(Eaton & Mains). We do not feel sure that the 
book will provide a method definite enough to be

easily pat in practice by a private student or by a 
class. But this ia a matter on which we cannot 
pass judgment by reading alone. On the other side, 
the book is excellent; it is not only entertaining, 
but it also has the good quality of arousing real 
interest : in reading it, one is constantly filled with 
a desire to begin and make speeches at once, just 
to try. Dr. Buckley has had long experience of 
extempore speaking ; we are not sure that he has 
had practice at individual teaching, but he has 
heard an immense amount of good speaking, and 
has trained himself with great care. His funda- 
mental ideas are sensible. It is true that they 
appear also to be rather hard to carry out, or, more 
exactly, rather easy not to carry oat rightly ; but 
the advantageous thing about the book is that the 
author is very full and quite practical in his sug- 
gestions as to .how his principles may be put in 
practice. Dr. Buckley's idea of extemporaneous 
peaking is speaking where the idea takes verbal 
form at the moment of utterance. His book will 
go far toward showing how one can actually speak 
in this way so as to express oneself and hold the 
attention of others. 

In his latest book, " Fables in 
Slang " (H. S. Stone & Co.), Mr. 
George Ade leaves the implications 
of his former character-studies and indulges in 
social satire, some of it pathetically humorous, some 
of it bordering closely on coarseness and vulgarity, 
and all of it coming near to making the use of 
slang a fine, even a literary, art. With this read- 
able volume, in which certain ill-considered illus- 
trations heighten all the defects of the text and 
lessen all of its virtues, comes a second volume of 
the reflections of the philosopher of the " Archey 
Road," bearing the title of " Mr. Dooley in the 
Hearts of His Countrymen " (Small, Maynard & 
Co.). A dedication to the English publishers re- 
producing the original book without authorization 
is in questionable taste ; and the closing chapter of 
the book, dealing with the Dreyfus trial, seems to 
be written for an English rather than an American 
audience, differing from the rest of the papers not 
merely in form but in appealing to a standard of 
humor which is assuredly neither Irish nor Amer- 
ican. The rest of the book contains the same genial 
satire as the earlier volume, and has a hearty laugh 
on every page, as well as merited rebuke of many 
iniquities in the English-speaking world. But it is 
scarcely literature in any of the senses in which the 
" Bigelow Papers " was, nor can it be said to be so 
intended. 

A well-written, entertaining book, 
and a foot-note of no small value to 
the history of the ill-starred and un- 
principled political enterprise it deals with, is Mrs. 
Sara Yorke Stevenson's " Maximilian in Mexico " 
(Century Co.). While the volume goes to some 
extent, and very intelligently, into the formal history 



of Napoleon the Little's fatuous Mexican perform- 
ance the attempt of a commonplace statesman to 
work out a political conception in the grand style, 
and foredoomed to a more or less farcical anti- 
climax it consists primarily of the reminiscences 
of an eye-witness who was in Mexico during the 
period of the French occupation, and who moved 
familiarly in the exotic society that set up its court 
at the ancient capital. The author makes us ac- 
quainted with the principal actors in the drama, 
and paints a picture of its social side that is at once 
fresh, animated, and suggestive. The book is showily 
bound in the Mexican colors, and contains a num- 
ber of portraits, notably a curious group of the 
firing party that shot Maximilian and Miramon. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Rev. Mr. MacDougall's "Conversion of the 
Maoris" (Presbyterian Board of Publication) has its 
importance from what the author has to say about that 
other segment of our imperial domain, Samoa. If any- 
thing can prove the unwisdom of entangling alliances 
with Europe, our experience here should do so; while 
the author shows that all the recent disturbances in the 
islands have been due to the white man's greed. And 
the natives always suffer, which is " the white man's 
burden " divested of its poetry. 

An " Auswahl aus Lutbers Deutschen Schriften " 
(Ginn), edited by Dr. W. H. Carruth, is an acceptable 
addition to the library of German texts available for 
college use. It includes a lengthy and important intro- 
duction, besides the usual body of notes. Dr. Albert 
B. .Faust is the editor of a volume of " Heine's Prose " 
(Macmillan), which includes over two hundred pages of 
carefully-chosen text. Dr. Hermann Scboenfeld has 
edited Schiller's " Maria Stuart" (Macmillan) for school 
use. Two other German text-books (Heath) are an 
" Erstes Deutsches Lesebuch," by Mr. Robert Nix ; and 
an edition, abridged, we regret to say, of Herr Suder- 
in. inn's " Der Katzensteg," edited by Dr. Benjamin W. 
Wells. 

A little book by John Barrett, former minister of 
the United States to Siam, is called Admiral George 
Dewey" (Harper), and devotes itself to a sketch of 
that redoubtable warrior during his trying days of ser- 
vice in Manila Bay. Mr. Barrett was with him during 
a great part of this time, and his narrative is an intimate 
one, though not rising to any great dignity as such. The 
book will serve to gratify the demands for knowledge 
of those who do not read the daily papers, from whose 
columns its matter is largely taken. 

An even dozen of volumes in the charming " Temple

who also sends us, in similar style of publication, a vol- 
ume of " Contes de la Vie Rustique," edited by Mr. 
George Castdgnier. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have sent us a new 
edition of the " Two Pilgrims' Progress " of Mr. and 
Mrs. Joseph Pennell. This story of a tricycle trip 
through Italy makes charming reading, and the draw- 
ings by Mr. Pennell make a notable addition to its 
charm. 

Charles Kingsley's " The Heroes " and Harriet Mar- 
tineau's " Feats on the Fjord " are the initial volumes 
of a new series of " Temple Classics for Young People," 
published by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. The volumes 
are illustrated, and very prettily gotten up in every 
respect. 

An American edition of Mr. H. A. Burberry's "Ama- 
teur Orchid Cultivator's Guide Book " has been pre- 
pared by Dr. J. M. W. Kitchen, and is published by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. The work has numer- 
ous illustrations, including several very attractive col- 
ored plates. 

" Browning's Shorter Poems," edited by Mr. Frank- 
lin T. Baker ; " The Merchant of Venice," edited by 
Miss Charlotte Whipple Underwood ; and " The Last 
of the Mohicans," edited by Mr. W. K. Wickes, are 
published by the Macmillan Co. in their " Pocket Eng- 
lish Classics" for school use. 

Encouraged by the success of Miss Selma Lagerlb'f's 
two novels, Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have published 
a volume of short stories by the same talented writer. 
The title of the volume is " Invisible Links," and the 
translator is Miss Pauline Bancroft Flach, to whom we 
are indebted for the other translations from Miss Lag- 
erlof. 

The new " Haworth " edition of the " Life and Works 
of the Sisters Bronte," to be completed in seven volumes, 
is begun with " Jane Eyre." The special features of this 
edition are the numerous illustrations, the prefaces by 
Mrs. Humphry Ward, and the inclusion of Mrs. Gas- 
kell's biography with supplementary notes by Mr. 
Clement K. Shorter. The Messrs. Harper are the pub- 
lishers. 

The publishers of the " William Shakespeare " (Mac- 
millan) of Dr. Georg Brandes have done wisely in re- 
printing the work in a single volume, at only one- third 
the price of the expensive first edition. It is a book 
that should be in the hands of every student of litera- 
ture, for it is nearly, if not quite, the most readable 
general treatment of the poet with which we are 
acquainted. 

A new edition of Shakespeare, in single-play vol- 
umes, is called the " Chiswick," and is published by 
Messrs. George Bell & Sons, London (Macmillan). 
The Cambridge text is used, and the notes are restricted 
to a few pages at the end. The illustrations are the 
work of Mr. Byam Shaw. "Hamlet," "Othello," 
" Macbeth," and " As You Like It" are the four vol- 
umes thus far issued. 

The Directors of the Old South Work have collected 
into a volume the historical " leaflets " (76-100) of the 
past two years or so, making the fourth volume of the

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



sort thus far issued. Slavery occupies the most promi- 
nent place in this collection, being represented by a 
group of seven or eight documents. Early explorations 
and colonial settlements are also well represented, and 
the value of the whole mass of material presented is 
very great. 

The death of John Codman Ropes on the 27th of 
October, the news of which did not reach us in time for 
our last issue, must be at least mentioned now, because 
he was a valued contributor to THE DIAL in its earlier 
years, and because of his high rank among American 
historical scholars. Born in 1836, he lived to be sixty- 
three yean of age. A lawyer by profession, he devoted 
a large part of bis later years to the study of military 
history, and produced several works of the highest 
value, including the " Life of Napoleon," The Battle 
of Waterloo," " The Army under Pope," and the " His- 
tory of the Civil War," which is now left unfinished, 
since he was working upon the third volume at the time 
of his death. 

The "Annotated Bibliography of American History," 
to which Mr. J. N. Lamed is seeking contributors, is a 
work that has been projected by Mr. George lies, of 
New York, and that will be published under the aus- 
pices of the American Library Association. In plan, 
the work will be on lines exemplified in Mr. Iles's 
" Annotated Bibliography of Fine Arts," published last 
year, with notes supplied by Mr. Russell Sturgis and 
Mr. Henry . Krehbiel, and it will carry one step 
further into practice the admirable idea of an "ap- 
praisal of literature " which Mr. lies has been urging 
for several years. To realize the idea he has already 
expended both money and time, and is prepared to 
expend more. He assumes the whole cost of the un- 
dertaking, with no probability of a return sufficient to 
reimburse him. The scheme of the work is (1) the 
selection of 1,500 or 2,000 titles of the books which 
readers in American history need most to have valued 
for them, either in commendation or warning ; and (2) 
the preparation of a brief note to each title, such as 
will appraise the book with full knowledge, with sound 
judgment, and with absolute sincerity. As far as pos- 
sible, these notes will be signed by the writers ; but if, 
in any case, a more independent judgment can be 
obtained by omitting the signature, this may be done. 
The single object in view is to procure for the reading 
public authoritative estimates of books, frankly and 
fearlessly expressed.

When Stephen Daye 

Opened up bis book shop in 1630, competition 
was not very marked, and customers received 
very little attention; but with the advance of 
civilization came the demands for better busi- 
ness methods. In no line of business has the 
evolution been so great as that of book-selling. 
From the old time-houored dingy shop, with 
its high shelves, has developed the modern 
book-shop with its glass oases, convenient ar- 
rangements, and abundance of light. From 
a very limited class of bookbuyers we have 
broadened out into an intelligent book-loving 
and book-reading nation, and to meet the 
wants of thousands of book-buyers, to whom 
a good book-shop is inaccessible, the system of 

Selling Books by Mail 

Has been established. To this class of read- 
ers we offer our services, together with one 
of the best equipped book-shops in Chicago.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



The Memoirs of Victor Hugo. 

This volume forms a most welcome and valuable addition to the works of Victor Hugo. 
No library will be complete without it. Two editions sold in advance of publication. 



"Congratulate the public that is to read it. From 
first to last the volume is interesting, and has quite 
retained the spirit of the original in this admirable 
translation by Mr. John W. Harding." JEANETTE L. 
GILDER in Chicago Tribune. 

" It is a delightful haphazard ohronique, with striking 
incidents brought out in Hugo's profuse vocabulary 
little sketches and thoughts about people and things, 
always interesting, never wearisome." Literary Newt. 

" The ' memoirs ' of such a man are worthy of our 
most serious attention." The Boston Times. 

" It is the real Hugo that is here the Hugo we 
knew amid the generous dreams of youth when his 
' abysses ' and ideas ' and ' nameless horrors ' and 
' apotheosis of love ' thrilled and fascinated us." Chi- 
cago Tribune. 

" His long and chequered life was filled with experi- 
ences of the most diverse character, literature, and 
polities, the court and the street, parliament and the 
theatre, labor, struggles, disappointments, exile, and 
triumphs. All of these are represented in the memoirs, 
and therefore the volume presents a series of pictures 
of infinite variety." The Cleveland Plain Dealer. 



" It tells in truthful, graphic manner how he looked 
upon the peoples and events of his times. It covers the 
period between the coronation of Charles X., at Rheims, 
in 1825, and ends with the siege of Paris." The Chi- 
cago Inter Ocean. 

11 Whoever has read a line of the works of Victor 
Hugo must wish for a thousand more, for the words of 
this the greatest of novelists are not too many. His 
wonderful ability has made his memoirs as interesting 
as any of his dramas or novels." Boston Courier. 

"Great scenes described by the most vivid word- 
artist of the century." New York World. 

"Full of the most characteristic bits, sentences, or 
whole paragraphs that no one but Hugo could have 
written." New York Time*. 

44 The temptation is great to keep on quoting from 
this fascinating book." The Critic. 

" It proves to be of even greater interest to the gen- 
eral reader than was anticipated. Students of history 
awaited it with a certainty that it would give them 
much that they wanted to know, and it does. Few 
memoirs ever written are so full of interest as these." 
The Bookseller, Newsdealer, and Stationer.

THE AMERICAN 



A NATIONAL 
WEEKLY JOURNAL. 



"Permit me to thank you for your 
courtesy in sending: me a copy of your 
review of my ' Impressions of South 
Africa.' Your reviewer has completely 
understood what I desired to convey, 
and I am much indebted to him for the 
evident pains he has taken to embody in 
his notice the points which I chiefly de- 
sired to emphasize, as well as for the 
skill which he has shown in presenting 
them to American readers." ( RT. 
HON.) JAMES BBYCE, House of Com- 
mons, London. 

" I thank you heartily for yours with 
enclosed clipping from THE AMERICAN. 
Naturally I am very much pleased by 
that review. I could not help being so, 
for it contains exactly the things I 
should like to think my book ('The 
Bough Riders ' ) deserved to have said 
of it." (Gov.) THEODOBE ROOSEVELT, 
Albany, N. Y. 

" Allow me to thank you for the very 
handsome review of my book, 'The 
State,' which appeared in your issue of 
yesterday. ... I was very glad to 
adopt the suggestions of your earlier 
notice of the book, so far as possible, 
for I at once recognized their value and 
pertinence." (PROF.) WOODKOW WIL- 
SON, Princeton, N. J. 



SINCE its birth nineteen years 
ago THE AMERICAN has spared 
no effort to maintain its literary 
columns on the highest plane 
of excellence ; to make this de- 
partment in every way deserv- 
ing of attention and worthy of 
confidence. 

As to the repute in which 
the literary columns of THE 
AMERICAN are held, and the 
general opinion as to the char- 
acter of its criticisms and com- 
ments on books and writers, the 
accompanying extracts from a 
few of many letters bear ample 
witness. 



" Your review of ' Magic ' is one of the 
best and most critical which I have re- 
ceived of this work. I have had over 
fifty so far. The book reviews in THE 
AMERICAN are exceptionally good, and 
I hope will result in giving you a large 
circulation, because they are so inde- 
pendent and critical that the reader can 
rely upon them." ALBERTS. HOPKINS, 
New York City. 

" I beg to thank you for your courtesy, 
in sending me the clipping from THE 
AMERICAN containing the review of my 
book entitled 'The Personal Equation.' 
I have read this notice with much pleas- 
ure and profit, and consider it one of the 
most thorough and appreciative reviews 
which the book has received." (PROF.) 
HARRY THCRSTON PECK, Columbia 
University, New York City. 

" The clipping from THE AMERICAN 
of a review of the ' Game Birds of North 
America' is received, and I desire to 
thank yon for so extended a notice of 
my little book and the very handsome 
way in which you have spoken of it. It 
is gratifyingto a naturalist to see in ar 
noticeohis work that the revieweotuy 
understands the subject." (DR.) D. 
G. ELLIOT, Field Columbian Museum, 
Chicago, 111. 



'* Your review of my ' Making of 
Hawaii ' is uncommonly discerning and 
thorough, as well as appreciative." 
(PROF.) WILLIAM F. BLACKMAN, Yale 
University, New Haven, Ct.

portrayed life. Some of his characters deserve immortality, so faithfully are they created." St. Louit Globe- Democrat.

that is being fought out in Congress; and Mrs. Burnett's intimate knowledge of Washington life in its less

a polished style, a wide culture, originality of thought and diction; it is a certain nobility of feeling and utterance which

contemporary life and manners in certain circles in London a series of thrilling events having taken the young Mary lander into 
the very heart of political and fashionable life of the London of Fox and Horace Walpole. For most of us such a novel is doubly 
valuable if, besides being thoroughly entertaining in its plot and its romance, and of good literary style, it is also accurate in 
its dealing with historical facts, and illuminating in its interpretation of movements and events. Mr. Churchill has not merely 
worked up something of history, of manners and customs, and of political and literary biography for the purpose of giving the 
color of the times to his story, but he has evidently brought a strong and clear mind, with unflinching resolution, to the genuine 
understanding of the larger bearings of the political, economic and social facts of the times in which his characters live and

able. . . . For our part, we look upon history as an art, by the study of which we may learn to govern ourselves In a way to 
avoid the pitfalls that have been the undoing of great peoples, of firmly established governments, . . . and it is so that Mr.

"The work has two distinct merits, either of which would serve to make it great that of telling a perfect story in a perfect 
way, and of giving a graphic picture of Roman society. . . . The story is exquisitely told and is the author's highest achieve- 
ment as yet in the realm of fiction." The Boston Traveller. 

" It is by far the most stirring and dramatic of all the author's Italian stories. . . . The plot is a masterly one, bringing

VIA CRUCIS: A Romance of the Second Crusade. 

By FRANCIS MARION CRAWFORD, author of "Saracinesca," "Ave Roma Immortalis," etc., 
etc. Illustrated by Louis LOEB. Crown 8vo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.50 

Mr. Crawford has gone back to the middle ages for the scene of his new novel a story of the most intense interest, full of 
the spirit of chivalry and Christian manhood. The main outline of this romance of the Second Crusade is based upon a broad 
study of the history of the period. Both St. Bernard and Queen Eleanor figure as characters, the hero's fortunes being inter- 
woven with those of the gay young queen. 

"The historian will approve its conscientious historic accuracy; the lover of adventure will find his blood stir and pulses 
quicken as he reads; the romantic reader will find here a tale of love passionate and pure; the student of character the subtle 
analysis and deft portrayal he loves." The Times Saturday Review. 



THE FAVOR OF PRINCES. 

By MARK LEE LUTHER, author of "The Livery of Honour," etc. Cloth. Crown 8vo, - $1.50 

A story of the time of Louis XV. as adventurous as any lover of a thrilling situation could wish. The incidents are capi- 
tally conceived and handled with a spirit and dash, which, coupled with the scene, inevitably suggests Dumas, and is unsurpassed 
even by him. 

YOUNG APRIL. 

By EGERTON CASTLE, author of "The Pride of Jennico," etc., etc. With illustrations by 
A. B. WENZELL. 12mo. Cloth extra, gilt top, $1.50 

"The aim of the writer would appear to have been to make everything in his book contribute to one rare impression of 
exquisite romance. Such an impression he unquestionably conveys. He has painted youth in all its chivalry and ideality, and 
has preserved its delicate bloom to the end, only deepening its magical effect by the epilogue in which he touches on its poignant 
place in the recollections of maturity." New York Tribune. 

"As in 'The Pride of Jennico,' there is a rare degree of beauty and distinction of literary style, combined with dash, color, 
and a fine sweep of dramatic movement." The Telegram, Providence.

CHILD LIFE IN COLONIAL DAYS. 

Written by ALICE MORSE EARLE, author of "Home Life in Colonial Days" and other Domestic 
and Social Histories of Olden Times. With many illustrations from photographs. Crown 8vo. Cloth 
extra, gilt top, $2.50 

It is a book to delight many different classes of readers, and although not primarily intended for young people, it cannot 
fail to be of absorbing interest to the younger generation, containing, as it does, so much of amusement and instruction. These 
volumes, whether read separately or together, present a commentary on early life in this country quite unequaled in our 
literature. 

HOME LIFE IN COLONIAL DAYS. 

By ALICE MORSE EARLE. Illustrated by photographs gathered by the author, $2.50 

"Comparatively little has been done until now toward the exposition of the everyday life of the pioneersand their descend- 
ants; the political history has been written, but the domestic has been neglected. Alice Morse Earle has published a most inter- 
esting volume to repair this deficiency, in her book on ' Home Life in Colonial Days.' The volume is unique; nothing quite like 
it has ever been attempted -before." Mail and Express. 

" The work is mainly and essentially an antiquarian account of the tools, implements and utensils, as well as the processes 
of colonial domestic industry; and it is full enough to serve as a moderate encyclopedia in that kind. . . This useful and 
attractive book, with its profuse and interesting pictures, its fair typography, and its quaint binding, imitative of an old-time 
sampler, should prove a favorite." The Dial. 

DIOMED: The Life, Travels, and Observations of a Dog.

Fully illustrated by JOSEPH M. GLEASON. 12mo. Cloth extra, $1.50 

Another of Mrs. Wright's delightful nature stories, full of entertainment and instruction. The book is particularly rich in 
illustration, as there are numerous full-page halftone engravings, and pen-and-ink sketches are scattered throughout the text. 
The latter are largely of unfamiliar flowers and plants, made familiar in the author's delightful way. 

THE JINGLE BOOK. SECOND EDITION. 

By CAROLYN WELLS. Illustrated by OLIVER HERFORD. Small quarto. Cloth, - $1.00 

No more delightful gift for young people could be imagined than this charming book. Author and artist are so happily in 

sympathy with each other that the clever drawings seem essential to the verses, and each strives to outdo the other in whimsical 

comicalities. Each page has its happy surprise and it will be a prosaic child who will not find delight in both pictures and jingles.

OPERA IN CHICAGO. 

The annual season of grand opera in Chi- 
cago is now practically at an end, and the re- 
sult is a very distinct announcement on the 
part of Mr. Maurice Grau that he will not re- 
turn another year unless a reasonable guaranty 
of financial support be provided. This an- 
nouncement is not made in a spirit of peevish- 
ness, but rather in a tone of genuine regret 
that Chicago should be no longer willing to 
give adequate support to an opera company 
whose efforts are based upon the highest stand- 
ard of artistic achievement. It is the logical 
consequence of the small attendance at the 
recent performances, coupled with the similar 
experience of the organization during the last 
three years. Clearly Mr. Grau and his associ- 
ates cannot be expected to produce opera in 
Chicago or any other city at a heavy yearly 
loss, and this is what they have been doing 
since 1895. Up to that date, the weekly re- 
ceipts for several years had averaged some- 
thing like fifty thousand dollars; during the 
last four years they have declined to something 
like thirty thousand dollars. In New York 
and Boston, Mr. Grau informs us, the advance 
subscriptions alone for the coming season 
amount to more than this sum per week; and 
in view of these facts, he is compelled to say 
that his philosophy, "as far as Chicago is con- 
cerned, has reached the limit." 

No fair-minded person can quarrel with 
either this reasoning or its logical outcome. 
Such a company of singers as have been 
brought together for the present year is un- 
surpassed in the history of opera, and cannot 
be paralleled anywhere in the world. Mr. Grau 
hardly exceeds the bare truth when he says : 
"If all the remaining singers in Europe were 
to be combined in one company, it would not 
equal in merit the company now appearing at 
the Chicago Auditorium." There have been 
a few unfortunate substitutions in the casts of 
the works presented, but the performances as 
a whole have been of a degree of artistic excel- 
lence that is rarely attained in any city of 
Europe. This year, as well as for the five or 
six years preceding, Mr. Grau has organized a 
company which has been capable of reaching 



414 



TIIK DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



what ten years ago was thought an impossible 
ideal, a company whose resources have been 
such as to make possible the production of Ger- 
man, French, and Italian works in the lan- 
guages in which they were written. We are no 
longer confined, as in years not very long past, 
to Italian opera, but have been given German 
opera and French opera instead of inartistic 
Italian translations of the French and German 
masterpieces. In Chicago, we have had, more- 
over, the services of the local orchestra that 
is, of such an orchestra as no other city in Amer- 
ica, and few others in Europe, can command 
for operatic purposes. And we have also a hall 
of unsurpassable acoustic qualities, and of such 
dimensions that it becomes possible to offer per- 
formances of the highest class at prices from 
one-half to two-thirds of those that obtain in 
nearly all other cities, large and small. But 
in spite of these manifest advantages, we have 
so neglected our opportunities that they now 
bid fair to be withdrawn altogether. 

The situation thus outlined is a curious one, 
and we do not wonder that Mr. Grau is dis- 
heartened. The showing is discreditable for a 
city with metropolitan aspirations, a city big 
enough to display active jealousy of New York, 
and wealthy enough to support a three months' 
rather than a three weeks' season of opera. It 
is a situation too complex to be explained by 
any one formula, and sufficiently interesting 
to be worth some attempt at analysis. We 
have followed the history of opera in Chicago 
with fairly close attention for the past twenty- 
five years, and it may be worth while to set 
forth a few of the conclusions that have been 
forced upon us by this lengthy and varied ex- 
perience. 

The first consideration to which we would 
call attention is of a very petty nature, but we 
believe it to be a serious factor in the present 
problem. While it is true that Chicago gets 
opera at lower prices than any other city, it is 
also true that it possesses an opera house of 
such capacity as to make low prices advisable 
even from the strictly business point of view of 
the management. Now the traditional price of 
opera in Chicago, maintained for many years 
before the Auditorium became available, was 
three dollars. In only two or three special 
cases such as those of Madame Lucca and 
Madame Patti was this price ever exceeded 
until about four years ago, when Mr. Grau 
took the ill-advised step of adding fifty cents 
to this sum. The decline of receipts began at 
that time, and has continued ever since. Fifty 



cents is a small matter, but the very pettiness 
of the advance caused it to be resented, and we 
believe that it would have been wiser to forego 
it altogether, or even to make it a still larger 
amount. The problem is a familiar one to 
students of economics ; it is that of determin- 
ing the price at which profits will reach their 
maximum aggregate. It is something to be 
found out by experiment alone ; and Mr. Grau's 
experiment has proved unfortunate. We do 
not doubt that he would have had larger re- 
ceipts every year had he adhered to the tradi- 
tional scale of prices, and we think it quite 
possible also that a considerably augmented 
scale of prices would have operated in the same 
way, although in this case with the accompan- 
iment of smaller audiences and conspicuously 
large vacant tracts in the body of the house. 

Another consideration is that opera of a 
sort and sometimes of a very good sort 
has of late been offered to the Chicago public 
upon increasingly frequent occasions at little 
more than ordinary theatre prices, and, dur- 
ing the past year, at even less than those 
prices. This must have had its effect upon 
an indiscriminating public, in which artistic 
appreciation is not developed to the point of 
realizing the vast difference between fine and 
ordinary performances. To a logical mind, 
the former is richly worth two or three times 
as much as the latter ; but the mind of the 
average opera-goer is not always logical. 

Then there have been many minor annoy- 
ances. Those have been disappointments in the 
case of individual singers of whose appearance 
there was a reasonable expectation, and disap- 
pointments in the case of substitutions of 
works and changes of bills concerning which 
the public has been left uninformed until the 
last possible moment. There have been now 
and then such artistic blots as the principal 
singers discoursing to one another in different 
languages an Italian Tannhauser with a Ger- 
man Frau Venus, for example and usually 
a chorus singing Italian to the French of a 
Faust or the German of a Lohengrin. Works 
have often been given with essential parts 
omitted, and this without any warning to the 
public, as in the cases of " Les Huguenots " 
and " Guglielmo Tell." There has frequently 
been stage-management of the most slovenly 
sort ; the fire scene in Die Walkure " has 
never been decently done in Chicago, the clos- 
ing scene in " Tannhauser " has been robbed 
of all its ethical effectiveness, and the final apo- 
theosis of " Faust " has been converted into a 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



415 



grotesque anti-climax. In operas that include 
a ballet, there has been hardly an apology for 
that feature, and in the case of " Faust " the 
great Walpurgis Night scene has been habitu- 
ally left out altogether. The stage sets have 
grown shabbier every year, and no attempt has 
been made to provide new ones. Finally, the 
boys who sell " books of the opera " have been 
permitted to cry their wares throughout the per- 
formance of the overture, although it might be 
the Vorspiel to " Lohengrin" or the introduc- 
tion to " Tristan and Isolde," neither of which 
can be really heard unless the most absolute 
silence obtains. 

All these things taken together constitute a 
heavy indictment, and Mr. Grau will do well to 
ponder upon them. They have shown a reck- 
less disregard of the minor details of art, which 
are to the sensitive mind almost as important 
as the leading features. They have resulted 
from the mistaken theory that opera is a thing 
for fashionable diversion and not a means of 
serious culture. They have combined with other 
influences to create a thoroughly unhealthy con- 
dition of affairs ; these things, and the vicious 
" star " system, and the meagreness of the re- 
pertoire presented from year to year, are ample 
to account for the f alling-off which is so greatly 
deplored. Concerning the limited repertoire of 
recent years, more than a word of comment is 
called for. The frequency with which such 
works as " Martha " and " II Trovatore " and 
" Romeo et Juliette " have been brought for- 
ward is an affront to the public intelligence. 
They are third-rate compositions, and it is de- 
plorable to waste upon them the resources of an 
organization which is capable of the highest 
achievements. It will not do to plead, as Mr. 
Grau does, that his recent experiments in new 
works have resulted in empty houses. If he 
means such operas as those of Massenet, they 
deserved no better fate. But if he means such 
works as " Falstaff " and " Otello," the public 
may be trusted to appreciate them in good time. 
Every manager ought to plan for the future, 
even at some present and temporary loss ; the 
great works will find hearers in the end, and in 
such numbers as to compensate for the loss that 
they may have occasioned in their earlier pres- 
entations. To give up, and fall back upon the 
old hackneyed favorites, merely because an un- 
familiar but meritorious composition does not 
at once command popular applause, is to save 
the present situation only at the cost of losing 
all control of the future. It is not only the 
new works that are neglected, but the acknowl- 



edged classics as well. Why do we so seldom 
hear " Fidelio," and why do we almost never 
hear " Orfeo " or " Die Zauberflote "? Among 
comparatively recent works, why does not 
" Mefistofele " stay in the current repertoire, 
why has " La Gisconda " been missing from it 
for many years, and why has Mr. Reyer's " Si- 
gurd " never found a way into it ? The simple 
fact remains that the round of works that one 
gets a chance to hear becomes narrower all the 
time, and in this condition of affairs there is no 
hope for permanence of interest in one of the 
noblest forms of art. Fifteen and twenty years 
ago in Chicago, although no such companies 
and singers as those which now come to us were 
known, the seeker after operatic culture in this 
city was given the opportunity of hearing a far 
greater variety of works, in performances that 
were at least tolerable. If opera is to be saved 
from the condition of dry rot into which it is 
now rapidly falling, it must be done chiefly by a 
decided enlargement of repertoire, including 
the revival of many neglected classics, and by a 
far more conscientious attention to artistic de- 
tails than has recently obtained.

GOOD LITERATURE FOR THE YOUNG. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As the head of a large family, in whose interest 1 
have been studying educational methods for twenty 
years past, may I say a word in commendation of your 
leading article in the current number of THE DIAL ? 
Although you have said it much better than I could 
have done, you have exactly expressed my feeling as to 
the great importance of familiarizing the young mind 
with the best literature, and training the memory by 
compelling its use in the highest degree. Modern edu- 
cators seemed to have overlooked the old truth that 
there is " no royal road to learning." From the kinder- 
garten, through the primary school certainly, if no 
farther, everything is made as easy as possible for the 
child. He is expected to observe many things, and to 
learn very few. In place of the good old method of 
memorizing and analyzing masterpieces of the poets, he 
is coaxed and amused by pretty songs and games. There 
is something to be said, I suppose, for the new ways, for 
the children (naturally) like them; but I cannot think 
that true mental discipline can be acquired without hard 
work; and it seems to me that any thinking man or 
woman who was educated under the system of thirty or 
forty years ago must be grateful for the steady grind 
which strengthened mind and memory alike, and which 
fostered a taste for the highest in literature which 
compelled the student to look up for his mental food 
rather than to find it on the level of his own untrained 
mind.

STEVJENSON'S LETTERS.* 

Those who enjoyed and that is to say all 
who read the series of Stevenson letters in 
44 Scribner's Magazine " will be glad to know 
that the comely volumes now before us are not 
a mere reprint of those pleasant epistles, but 
contain in addition to them nearly as many 
new ones of equal interest and quality. It is 
rather late in the day now to trumpet in a 
review Robert Louis Stevenson's gift as a let- 
ter writer. His place with the half-score or so 
of moderns who have excelled in this alleged 
lost art is already as secure as FitzGerald's, 
and it is no great venture in opinion to say 
that his letters the really Stevensonian ones, 
we mean, the ones that make us wonder the 
more at the miraculous fact that the writer of 
such whimsical, fantastical, delightfully non- 
sensical missives was a Scotchman are easily 
the best in their kind that have appeared in 
print since Lamb's. If Tusitala carried in his 
mind's eye any epistolary model at all, which 
is doubtful, that model was assuredly 44 Elia." 

Stevenson, whe had a modest opinion of his 
own work in general (" a great performer be- 
fore the Lord on the penny-whistle," he calls 
himself), sincerely believed himself to be a 
dismal and constitutional failure as a corres- 
pondent. The content of his letters he forcibly 
styled " rot " ; and he thought his mind one 
44 essentially and originally incapable of the art 
epistolary." It would be difficult, indeed, to 
specify, for the satisfaction of the unco-literal 
and serious-minded, just wherein lies the ele- 
ment of permanent and positive value in his 
letters, very much as it would be difficult to 
satisfy " Mr. Gradgrind " as to the abiding 
merits of Lamb's essay on roast pig. Their 
charm is a subtle essence, potent but elusive. 
As to form, they have none: It is their spe- 
cialty to have none. As to matter, Stevenson's 
own epithet rot " has a certain applicability 
to not a few, and even to some of the most 
characteristic, of them to the following one 
to James Payn, for instance, which 44 Elia " 
himself might have written to Manning. Stev- 
enson writes from the steamer " Liibeck," and 
in the character of an ancient mariner. 

" Excuse a plain seaman if he regards with scorn the 
likes of you pore landlubbers ashore now. (Reference

to nautical ditty). Which I may however be allowed 
to add that when eight months' mail was laid by my 
side one evening in Apia, and my wife and I sat up 
most of the night to peruse the same (precious indis- 
posed we were next day in consequence) no letter, 
out of to many, more appealed to our hearts than one 
from the pore, stick-in-the-mud, land-lubbering, com- 
mon (or garden) Londoner, James Payn. Thank you 
for it; my wife says, 'Can't I see him when we get 
back to London ? ' I have told her the thing appeared 
to me within the spear of practical politix. . . How 
you skim along, you and Andrew Lang (different as 
you are), and yet the only two who can keep a fellow 
smiling every page, and ever and again laughing out 
loud. I joke wi' deeficulty, I believe; I am not funny; 
and when I am, Mrs. Oliphant says I'm vulgar. . . . 
My dear sir, I grow more and more idiotic; I cannot 
even feign sanity. Sometime in the month of June 
a stalwart, weather-beaten man, evidently of seafaring 
antecedents, shall be observed wending his way between 
the Athenaeum Club and Waterloo Place. Arrived off 
No. 17, he shall be observed to bring his head sharply 
to the wind, and tack into the outer haven. ' Captain 
Payn in the harbour ? ' ' Ay, ay, sir. What ship ? ' 
1 Barquentine R. L. S., nine hundred and odd days out 
from the port of Bournemouth, homeward bound, with 
yarns and curiosities.' " 

Stevenson was a man of genius, and of a keen 
eye and a singularly independent mind, and 
the fact that he was so is flashed upon us often 
enough and brilliantly enough in his letters ; 
but their purely intellectual quality is by no 
means their dominant and characteristic qual- 
ity. We cannot dispose of the collection 
by affixing to it the serviceable old labels, 
44 freighted with wisdom" and " charged with 
sober reflection." Of deliberate speculation 
or theorizing upon the graver problems of life, 
there is hardly a trace. That Stevenson, a 
thoughtful man, a man of imagination and keen 
sensibility, to whom for years death had been 
visibly beckoning, pondered much and pain- 
fully upon those problems, may be taken for 
granted. But whatever forebodings, whatever 
spiritual doubts and misgivings may have 
haunted him, he kept them to himself like a 
man, and did not transmit them through the 
mails to his friends.* As a correspondent, 
from this point of view, no stronger contrast 
to this sunny and gallant spirit can be sug- 
gested than his friend John Addington Sy- 
monds, who wrote, as it might seem, with his 
coffin before him, who groaned and fretted over 
the hereafter through reams of sepulchral cor- 
respondence, and whose letters, however elo- 
quent, profound, and mournfully edifying they 
may be, are not seldom about as cheery and 
enlivening as the wail of a banshee. 

In one instance we find him admitting : " I hate diffusing 
the scent of the charnel. I am doing it, however, in this 
letter."

THE DIAL

As mere chronicles, Stevenson's letters are of 
no great value. "I deny," he writes in one of 
them, "that letters should contain news (I mean 
mine, other people's should)"; and so, as a rule, 
he consistently refrained from pelting his cor- 
respondents with facts (" sordid facts," he calls 
them) about himself and the world he moved 
in. As the excellent editor, Mr. Colvin, re- 
marks, the letters are not at all of the sort that 
can be woven into the texture of a biographical 
narrative. Were we to attempt to divine the 
secret of their worth and charm, of the hold 
they now have, and will long continue to have, 
upon almost all classes of readers, we should 
say that it lies in their complete spontaneity, 
and in the resulting fact that they place us 
closely en rapport with one of the rarest and 
most captivating personalities that ever graced 
the profession of letters. They reflect as a 
mirror the mood of the moment, the passing 
whim, the fleeting humor of this mutable, kindly 
spirit, " most fantastic but most human." Mr. 
Colvin assures us that the letters at their best 
" come nearer than anything else to the full- 
blooded charm and variety of Stevenson's con- 
versation." Of that conversation Mr. Henley 
has written : * 

"I leave his praise in this direction (the telling of 
Scottish vernacular stories) to others. It is more to my 
purpose to note that he will discourse with you of 
morals, music, marbles, men, manners, metaphysics, 
medicine, mangold-wurzel que scays-je f with equal 
insight into essentials and equal pregnancy and felicity 
of utterance ; and that he will stop with you to make 
mud pies in the first gutter, range in your company 
whatever heights of thought and feeling you have found 
accessible, and end by guiding you to altitudes far nearer 
the stars than you have ever dreamed of footing it; and 
that at the last he makes you wonder which to admire 
the more his easy familiarity with the Eternal Veraci- 
ties or the brilliant flashes of imbecility with which his 
excursions into the infinite are sometimes diversified. 
He radiates talk, as the sun does light and heat; and 
after an evening or a week with him, you come 
forth with a sense of satisfaction in your own capacity 
which somehow proves superior even to the inevitable 
conclusion that your brilliance was but the reflection of 
his own, and that all the while you were only playing 
the part of Rubinstein's piano to Sarasate's violin." 

Let us add to this somewhat extravagant 
flight of Mr. Henley's an observation of Mr. 
Colvin's on a certain eccentric side of Steven- 
son's character which peeps out occasionally, in 
a rather startling way, in the letters: 

" There was yet another and very different side to 
Stevenson which struck others more than it struck my- 
self, namely, that of the perfectly freakish, not perfectly 
human, irresponsible madcap or jester which sometimes 
appeared in him. It is true that his demoniac quick-

ness of wit and intelligence suggested occasionally a 
'spirit of air and fire ' rather than one of earth; that he 
was abundantly given to all kinds of quirk and laugh- 
ter; and that there was no jest (saving the unkind) he 
would not make and relish. In the streets of Edin- 
burgh he had certainly been known for queer pranks 
and mystifications in youth ; and up to middle life there 
seemed to some of his friends to be much, if not of the 
Puck, at least of the Ariel, about him." 

It is good to know that the closing years of 
Stevenson, the years of exile and daily battle 
with disease, were at least free from the stress 
of pecuniary strait and anxiety. His share in 
the proceeds of the sale of his writings was a just 
and even a handsome one. In this connection 
it is pleasant to quote a passage from a letter 
to Mr. Archer (October, 1887), which makes 
agreeable reading in more ways than one : 

" I am now a salaried party ; I am a bourgeois now ; 
I am to write a weekly paper for Scribner's, at a scale 
of payment which makes my teeth ache for shame and 
diffidence. The editor is, I believe, to apply to you ; 
for we were talking over likely men, and when I in- 
stanced you, he said he had had his eye upon you from 
the first. It is worth while, perhaps, to get in tow with 
the Scribners ; they are such thorough gentlefolk in all 
ways that it is always a pleasure to deal with them. I 
am like to be a millionaire if this goes on, and be pub- 
licly hanged at the social revolution : well, I would 
prefer that to dying in my bed ; and it would be a 
godsend to my biographer, if ever I have one." 

Mr. Colvin's editing is all that can be de- 
sired painstaking, helpful, and unobtrusive ; 
and his Introductory is a delightful piece of 
work, from which we shall allow ourselves one 
more quotation, a sketch of Stevenson's outer 
man. 

" All this the reader should imagine as helped by 
the most speaking of presences: a steady, penetrating 
fire in the wide-set eyes, a compelling power and sweet- 
ness in the smile; courteous, waving gestures of the 
arms and long, nervous hands, a lit cigarette generally 
held between the fingers; continual rapid shif tings and 
pacings to and fro as he conversed : rapid, but not flur- 
ried nor awkward, for there was a grace in his attenu- 
ated but well-carried figure, and his movements were 
light, deft, and full of spring. When I first knew him 
he was passing through a period of neatness between 
two of Bohemian carelessness as to dress; so that the 
effect of his charm was immediate. At other times of 
his youth there was something for strangers, and even 
for friends, to get over in the odd garments which it 
was his whim to wear the badge, as they always 
seemed to me, partly of a genuine carelessness, cer- 
tainly of a genuine lack of cash (the little he had was 
always absolutely at the disposal of his friends), partly 
of a deliberate detachment from any particular social 
class or caste, partly of his love of pickles and adven- 
tures, which he thought befell a man thus attired more 
readily than another. But this slender, slovenly, non- 
descript apparition, long-visaged and long-haired, had 
only to speak in order to be recognized in the first 
minute for a witty and charming gentleman, and within 
the first five for a master spirit and man of genius."

One interesting, and we think decidedly re- 
grettable, fact that appears in Mr. Colvin's 
Introduction must be noted in closing. Lack 
of the needful leisure has compelled him to 
abandon the idea of preparing the separate vol- 
ume of biography which was to complete his 
literary memorial to his friend. The book is 
now, we learn, at the wish of Stevenson's fam- 
ily, to be undertaken by his cousin, Mr. Gra- 
ham Balfour. The volumes are manufactured 
in a style befitting their delightful content.

FROM ACCAWMACKE TO APPOMATTOX.* 

The literature of Virginia has been much 
enriched during recent years. The delightful 
story by Mr. John Fiske of " Old Virginia and 
her Neighbors," and the more technical but 
equally valuable study by Mr. Philip Alexander 
Bruce of the " Economic History of Virginia in 
the Seventeenth Century," together with the 
charming romances from the pen of Mrs. Maud 
Wilder Goodwin, have prepared all interested 
in American history to welcome the two vol- 
umes which have been given to the press under 
the editorial supervision of Mr. John S. Wise. 
The one is an autobiographical sketch, rich in 
illustration of the life and times " before the 
war "; the other, a more dignified and stately 
account of the career of a former governor of 
Virginia, whose lot it was to send the soul of 
old John Brown " marching on." 

" The End of an Era " is a book full of life, 
the well-written story of the development of a 
wide-awake boy, who asks questions, who won- 
ders about many things, and who has the un- 
common fortune to come close to great leaders 
of thought and action in a most critical period 
in the history of his country. Seeing things as 
a boy or as a growing youth, the skill in nar- 
ration is such that, even as a man past fifty 
years of age, Mr. Wise preserves in a remark- 
able way the boyish element which is absolutely 
essential to the correct recounting of the details 
of his life, from his childhood in Accomack, 
until, still several years from his majority, the 
era ended, the former things passed away, and 
everything was made new after Appomattox. 
It is this particular feature that gives charm to 
the book ; and it is not to be wondered at.

therefore, that the interest lags somewhat after 
the boy has become man enough to join the 
Confederate Reserves, that aggregation of old 
men and striplings which General Grant per- 
haps had in mind when he said that the Con- 
federacy was robbing the cradle and the 
grave " to fill up its armies. 

The ancestral home of the Wise family was 
in John Smith's " Kingdom of Accawmacke," 
in the eastern peninsula of Virginia, a place 
long without railroad or telegraph or any such 
device of modern industrial life, and, despite 
the introduction of these conveniences of 
present-day civilization, a place where old cus- 
toms remain unchanged, and where to-day 
representatives remain of the very families that 
inhabited the region when Charles the First 
was king, and gave the name of " Old Domin- 
ion " to the colony which did not like Crom- 
well but offered a crown and a kingdom to the 
unfortunate Stuarts. Even Mr. Thomas Nelson 
Page, in his sketches of life in " The Old 
South," has not surpassed Mr. Wise in hia 
account of days and deeds in this quaint county 
of Virginia. 

But fortune did not keep the family of Henry 
A. Wise always in Accomack. After an ex- 
citing canvass of the state in the Know-Nothing 
campaign, the father was elected governor, and 
removed to Richmond. Here new scenes aroused 
the inquisitive interest of the son ; and when, 
later, he was put out of danger of war's mis- 
haps by sequestration in the mountains of the 
western part of the state, and, still later, was 
sent to the Virginia Military Institute for hi* 
education, it was his peculiar experience while 
yet in the formative days of youth to gain a 
knowledge of the great variations in the climate, 
soil, and products of Virginia, and to come into 
close contact with representatives of the differ- 
ing elements of population, ranging in wide 
extremes from the gay cavaliers of the Eastern 
Shore to the sturdy Scotch-Irishmen of Pres- 
byterian Lexington. No contrast could be more 
striking than the description of the reception 
tendered by his neighbors in Accomack to 
Henry A. Wise on his return from service as 
minister to Brazil, where mirth and jollity and 
good fellowship abounded, and, at the other 
extreme, the account of life in Lexington where 
the Presbyterian church looked cold as a dog'a 
nose, and where " an evening spent among them 
is like sitting upon uvW^s cracking hailstones 
with one's teeth." 

The sidelights thrown upon the social and 
political life of the time give value to the vol-

ume. The method of election is thus described : 
" In due course came election day. Father being 
absent, the young cousin above referred to represented 
him at the polling place, and took me with him. In 
those days voting was done openly, or viva voce as it 
was called, and not by ballot. The election judges, who 
were magistrates, sat upon a bench with their clerks 
before them. Where practicable, it was customary for 
the candidate to be present in person and to occupy a 
seat at the side of the judges. As a voter appeared his 
name was called out in a loud voice. The judges 
inquired, ' John Jones (or Bill Smith) for whom do you 
vote ' for governor, or whatever was the office to be 
filled. He replied by proclaiming the name of his 
favorite. Then the clerks enrolled the vote, and the 
judges announced it as enrolled. The representative of 
the candidate for whom he voted arose, bowed, and 
thanked him aloud ; and his partisans often applauded." 

The pen pictures of prominent men are 
always striking, and sometimes are exception- 
ally good. An example is the description of 
General Winfield Scott : 

"And Old Fuss and Feathers! Bless his colossal old 
soul ! was ever a name more appropriately bestowed ? 
What a monster in size he was! Never was uniform 
more magnificent; never were feathers in cocked hat 
more profuse; never was sash so broad and gorgeous. 
He was old and gouty, keen for food, quick for drink, 
and thunderous of voice, large as a strawstack and red 
as a boiled lobster. His talk was like the roaring of a 
lion, his walk like the tread of an elephant. No turkey 
gobbler ever strutted or gobbled with more self- 
importance than did the hero of Lundy's Lane." 

Everywhere in the book there are suggestive 
paragraphs. The youth sees a production of 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin " on a Philadelphia stage. 
There are elements in the slave business, as 
set forth in the play, which are unknown to 
him. He has bitter thoughts ; he denies the 
justness of the representation. Then a desire 
comes over him to see a slave auction. One 
visit is enough, and he goes away in disgust 
and with longings for the removal of the evils 
of the system. The John Brown raid makes 
a special impression upon him, because of 
his father's official connection with the case. 
The attitude of the North is not liked by Vir- 
ginia, and the fact appears, from the Southern 
point of view, that there is an " irrepressible 
conflict " coming. When the war breaks out, 
the effect of the exposure of camp and battle is 
strikingly indicated, as a crack regiment once 
gay with splendid equipments reappears after 
a period of service. The subdued home-life is 
described, where men are absent, where the 
death of some member of the family brings 
profound grief and makes the women suffer 
untold agonies, as with fearful hearts they 
keep waiting for the war to cease. 

" Every arms-bearing Tayloe, son, brother, husband, 



was in the forefront, save one. He had already fallen; 
his portrait hung in the spacious drawing-room beside 
the others. His name was spoken and spoken again 
with gentle tears, and with that reverence which the 
devout render to the Christian martyr. . . . Who can 
picture the desolating sorrow which engulfed them, as 
one by one the strong arms on which that household 
depended fell helpless, and the news came home that 
the brave hearts for whose safety they prayed had ceased 
to beat! for it was so. The war filled grave after grave 
in the graveyard of the Tayloe family, until, when it 
ended, the male line was almost extinct." 

Such pictures as these show how the Confed- 
eracy exhausted every resource before, driven 
from Richmond, its army was forced to sur- 
render at Appomattox. The three quotations 
on varied themes give some idea of the style of 
the author of a very readable and very sugges- 
tive volume. 

The more sober and dignified style employed 
by the grandson of Henry A. Wise in writing 
his biographical study makes his volume a de- 
sirable companion for the one just described. 
Naturally enough, the two narratives cross 
paths in many places, and when they are ex- 
amined in conjunction there is basis for the 
suspicion that the preparation for publication 
of the " Life " of his father after the death of 
its author may have suggested to Mr. John S. 
Wise the idea of " The End of an Era," many 
things in the latter book admirably supple- 
menting the chapters of the former. 

Governor Wise had many experiences dur- 
ing his seventy years of life. As Member of 
Congress, Minister to Brazil, member of sev- 
eral important conventions, state and national, 
Governor of Virginia, and officer in the Con- 
federate army, he played a prominent part in 
the politics of his time. Each of these features 
of his public career is carefully considered, 
important speeches and letters being intro- 
duced in appropriate connection by way of 
illustration. Mr. Wise's own point of view 
has been indicated in his " Seven Decades of 
the Union," and in many respects the grand- 
son adheres closely to the lines there laid down. 

There are special chapters devoted to the 
Graves-Cilley duel, in connection with which 
Mr. Wise was severely blamed, to the Know- 
Nothing campaign of 1855, which resulted in 
his election to the governorship of the state, 
and to the John Brown raid and its conse- 
quences which brought upon his head a torrent 
of abuse. Opposing secession and strongly 
advocating the policy of making a fight within 
the Union, he joined his fellow-citizens when 
Virginia seceded and cast his lot with the 
South. A third of the volume is given to

Civil War history as it affected his career, and 
in this part the book shares the criticism passed 
upon the other one already described. The 
interest clearly lags when the individuality of 
the roan is lost in the cause for which he 
fought. 

The biography is the work of one who loved 
his grandfather as a hero. Despite such a 
friendly relationship of author and subject, 
there is not that constant praise which might 
be expected. Faults are recognized, distinct 
failures are recorded, and on the whole the 
reader gets the impression that the volume is 
a fair presentation of the character of one who 
helped to make the history of Virginia before 
the war, and, considering Virginia's importance 
then, contributed not a little to the history of 
his party and his country.

THE NEW BYRON.* 

The third volume of Byron's Letters and 
Journalsf covers the period between January, 
1814, and November, 1816, the period of 
"The Corsair" and "Lara" and the Third 
Canto of " Childe Harold," as well as of the 
ill-starred marriage and separation. The im- 
portance of the volume may only be partly 
inferred from the fact that more than half of 
the letters and other material it contains is here 
collected for the first time. In addition to 233 
letters, there is an appendix containing 73 let- 
ters and other statements concerning the sepa- 
ration, most of them either by Lady Byron or 
by Mrs. Leigh. There are, moreover, seven 
other appendices, containing, among other in- 
teresting material, a number of letters from 
Byron to Miss Millbanke and some extraordi- 
nary letters from Jane Clainnont to Byron. 

With respect to the cause of the separation, 
Mr. Prothero wisely takes a very cautious atti- 
tude. "No evidence," he remarks, "exists to 
prove the precise nature of the charges on which 
Lady Byron separated from her husband. They 
were, as Byron alleged, unknown to himself and 
his friends. In these circumstances, nothing 
can be gained by adding another guess to the 
conjectures which have been, at various times,

hazarded." It were very much to be hoped that 
all future biographers and critics would take 
the same conservative view. Unfortunately, 
however, it is too much to hope. This is the 
very sort of subject that excites the unwise to 
an incontinence of comment. The command- 
ment " Judge not " is the one least of all heeded 
by the " unco guid," who doubtless imagine that 
the penalty of this particular law could have 
little peril for themselves. The usual assump- 
tion that there is some profound mystery behind 
the facts that have been disclosed is quite gratu- 
itous. One would think that mismated couples 
were unheard of, and the effects of " incom- 
patibility of temper " quite unknown. Accus- 
tomed to placid manners and regulated feelings, 
Lady Byron was terrified by her lord's out- 
bursts and deemed herself unsafe in his com- 
pany. Unable to understand the first principles 
of Byron's character, she was naturally unequal 
to the role of governess. With all her admirable 
qualities, she was of a type most irritating 
to a man whose conduct was, unfortunately, 
regulated by generous impulses rather than by 
principle, which is so often but a fine name 
for calculation. That she was au innocent cause 
of irritation to him, none knew better than 
herself. Five days after she left Byron's house, 
she wrote to his sister Augusta, with whom she 
was still on terms of the most affectionate con- 
fidence: 

*' Disease or not all my recollections and reflections 
tend to convince me that the irritability is inseparably 
connected with me in a greater degree than with any 
other object, that my presence has been uniformly op- 
pressive to him from the hour we married if not 
before, and in his best moods he has always wished to 
be away from me." 

One cannot but feel that this pathetic confes- 
sion tells us more than the most searching 
analysis of all the circumstances could possibly 
bring to light. Certainly a woman, whatever 
be her virtues and graces, whom a man in his 
best moods instinctively shuns, is scarcely the 
person marked out by nature to be his wife. 
If one looks for causes, one can find some hints 
in the dispirited and unimpassioned tone of 
Byron's letters to her before marriage, in her 
own letters, and in the strongly-marked rather 
than winning features of her portrait prefixed 
to the volume before us. Here is an example 
of her epistolary style, from a letter to her 
husband written less than a month after she 
left him : 

" I cannot attribute your ' state of mind ' to any cause 
so much as the total dereliction of principle, which, since 
our marriage, you have professed and gloried in. Your

acknowledgements have not been accompanied by any 
intentions of amendment." 

Need it be wondered that to such " representa- 
tions " (to quote again the lady's words) Byron 
" had replied by a determination to be wicked "? 
One cannot help speculating how matters would 
have stood had Lady Byron been a little less 
uncompromising in her requirements, and had 
she formed her epistolary style upon some less 
august model. 

The second volume of Byron's Poetry con- 
tains the whole of " Childe Harold." It is a 
pleasure to be able to say at once and compre- 
hensively that Mr. Coleridge has given us not 
only the best edition of this classic hitherto 
produced, but an edition which leaves little in 
any sense to be desired. The text is based upon 
that of the Library Edition of 1855, which has 
been collated with all the existing MSS. All 
the notes of Byron and of Hobhouse have been 
retained, and verified or supplemented by the 
editor, whose method and sympathetic attitude 
may be inferred from the following words of 
his Preface : 

" It is in the belief that Childe Harold ' should be 
read continuously, and that it gains by the closest study, 
reassuming its original freshness and splendour, that 
the text as well as Byron's own notes have been some- 
what minutely annotated." 

The variant readings of the MSS. are recorded 
underneath the text, and the notes of the editor 
are printed at the foot of the page. The vari- 
ants give convincing proof of Byron's artistic 
taste, inasmuch as the finally preferred reading 
is, so far as I have observed, invariably the 
best. Mr. Coleridge's notes not only give well 
authenticated information with respect to mat- 
ters of fact ; they also provide, unobtrusively 
and tastefully, interpretations of obscure pas- 
sages, and they call the attention of the reader 
to the thread of connection, or, as the case may 
be, to the underlying philosophy which one is 
apt to overlook (sometimes, indeed, without 
great loss) in one's delight in the glowing im- 
ages and the vivid panorama. To each of the 
cantos is prefixed an introduction containing 
the history of the composition and publication 
of the work. Mr. Coleridge points out that it 
consists really of three distinct poems bound 
together by the general scheme of the Pilgrim- 
age. And he does not conceal Byron's indebted- 
ness in the second part of the poem (Canto 
III.) to Shelley, and in the third part (Canto 
IV.) to Hobhouse. 

" As the delicate spirit' of Shelley suffused the third 
canto of ' Childe Harold,' so the fourth reveals the pres- 
ence and cooperation of Hobhouse. To his brother-poet 



he owed a fresh conception, perhaps a fresh apprecia- 
tion, of nature; to his life-long friend, a fresh enthusi- 
asm for art, and a host of details, dry bones . . . which 
he awakened into the fulness of life.' " 

Finally, Mr. Coleridge gives the reader a 
timely reminder of the marked originality of 
design characterizing this splendid poem. 

" ' Childe Harold's Pilgrimage ' had no progenitors, 
and, with the exception of some feeble and forgotten 
imitations, it has had no descendants. The materials 
of the poem, . . . the sentiments and reflections coeval 
with reflection and sentiment, wear a familiar hue; but 
the poem itself, a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of 
renown, a song of travel, a rhythmical diorama, was 
Byron's own handiwork not an inheritance, but a 
creation." 

Five volumes of the twelve are now before 
us. It is already plain that the wealth of new 
material in the shape of additional or ungarbled 
letters, and other Byroniana, will compel critics 
and biographers to take a new survey of Byron. 
It seems to me probable that in the future more 
charitable judgments will prevail touching his 
character and aims. Certainly anything that 
throws new light upon a character so strong, 
so complex, and so puzzling, should be wel- 
comed as valuable materials for the future sci- 
ence of human nature. For the two scholarly 
editors, it is not too much to say that, in build- 
ing this noble monument to Byron, they are 
identifying themselves " with the immortality 
of his fame." MELVILLE B. ANDERSON. 



THE VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF ART.* 



There have been those who inquired, in a 
depreciatory way, as to the value of the study 
of the history of art. It has been felt that the 
study of historical art tends to take one away 
from the really vital examples of art in our own 
time ; makes one, often enough, elevate to an 
undeserved position some artist whose absolute 
value is slight, because of his relative import- 
ance ; leads one too often to concentrate the 
attention upon absolutely unimportant ques- 
tions of historical accuracy. We have all heard 
meaningless and absurd censures, as well as 
those just mentioned ; but these points are cer- 
tainly fairly taken : they show real dangers in 
the historical study of art, they point out what

is actually likely to take place with anyone who 
gets well fixed in the head the idea of historical 
value. 

Aside from these points which are merely 
dangers, not insuperable inconsistencies it is 
felt by many that the historical study of art 
brings to predominance, even if for the time 
only, a certain disposition which is not only not 
artistic but unfavorable to the artistic disposi- 
tion. The passion nowadays for it is almost 
8U ch for knowing about the development of 
things, is something antagonistic, it is often 
thought, to the real enjoyment of those things. 
In matters of art, it substitutes for an artistic 
appreciation an intellectual understanding, 
which is a very different matter. 

We may pass these matters in review in our 
mind, and yet, whatever the value of historical 
study to those who merely love art without any 
idea of becoming artists, we cannot well deny 
that the actual artist of our time, the painter 
of the present century, has profited to a con- 
siderable degree by the history of art. For one 
thing, there has been more history than there 
used to be ; for another, it has been more easy 
to get at it. But whatever the reason, the fact 
would probably not be disputed that the influ- 
ence of the past has been greater, for good and 
evil too, on the painters of this century than has 
ever before been the case. 

The matter is curiously indicated by three 
books which come to hand at the same moment, 
almost accidentally: one, a life of Nicholas 
Poussin, one on Luini, and one on Velasquez. 
These three names are significant in the history 
of painting of our century. They are not sig- 
nificant of everything, it must be confessed ; 
they do not sum up the artistic movements of 
our time. But they are probably quite as sig- 
nificant in the question in hand as any other 
three names in the history of painting. You 
might substitute some other name for that of 
Ponssin, in some ways, Claude Lorraine 
would be better: you might say Botticelli in- 
stead of Luini. But although one or another 
substitution might be made, it would be hard 
to find any other three names as significant as 
these, so that the books are naturally of 
interest. 

The fame of Nicholas Poussin is not what it 
used to be. In 1841 "every school-boy," we 
are told, knew that he was called "learned" 
because of his profound classical knowledge ; at 
present you could find many older persons 
ignorant of the fact : there may even be lovers 
of art with very hazy ideas on the difference 



between him and that Gaspar who took his 
name. It shows how times have changed in 
half a century. 

There was a time when the dicta of Mr. 
Raskin on any painting or painter carried great 
weight. The poem of the man who mourned 
because cruel Ruskin would stick his tusk in and 
nobody would buy, seems adequate illustration 
if not absolute proof. Even the fact that his 
comment on Mr. Whistler's picture was thought 
by twelve good men and true to have injured 
that artist's reputation to the extent of one 
farthing only, should not make us feel that Mr. 
Ruskin was not at one time a great authority 
on painting. It will be remembered that he 
won his eminence by a work which was meant 
to place Turner in his rightful position : it may 
not be so often recalled that one of the purposes 
of " Modern Painters " was to show the superi- 
ority of modern artists, and especially Turner, 
in landscape painting to the old masters. And 
the old (or "older") masters in question, who 
were they? It gives one who has forgotten a 
little start of surprise to recall that Mr. Ruskin 
was defending Turner against Claude Lorraine, 
Gaspar Poussin, Salvator Rosa, and many 
others, some better known, but none of very 
vital interest to-day. It is among those masters 
that Nicholas Poussin would naturally take his 
place. He was one of the earliest and most 
famous of that school that finally produced Sir 
George Beaumont's brown tree. 

It is significant that Dr. lizabeth Denio's 
monograph on Poussin is absolutely historical. 
It tells with a good deal of learning and detail 
what Poussin painted and what he did from 
birth to death. But it does not have a single 
word in it which shows why the present gene- 
ration should have for Poussin more than a 
historical curiosity. If one does wish to know 
about the man, it is well that one should have 
a careful record of his work ; and as such this 
book has value. But it would have been well 
to give some idea as to why one nowadays 
should wish to know anything about Nicholas 
Poussin. Not to do so is hardly quite just to 
its subject. It is true that Nicholas Poussin 
is not an influence to-day, as is his contemporary 
Velasquez. Still, he deserves to be separated 
from the crowd of half-forgotten landscapists, 
even as a landscapist, and quite aside from the 
other directions of his genius. Mr. Ruskin who 
was very severe on many of his " older masters," 
especially excepted Nicholas Poussin, found in 
him things worthy of recollection and preserva- 
tion, and even held him to be at times a lover

THE DIAL,

of truth. It would have been well, in a book 
like this, to have this distinction brought out; 
as it is not, the book can hardly be considered 
adequate from the point of view of the student 
of art. It has good points as a biography 
(though charm of style is not one of them); 
and, though not profusely illustrated, has sev- 
eral pictures which are well chosen for the ex- 
hibition of Poussin's different characteristics. 

The older masters the " Van somethings 
and Back somethings," to use Mr. Ruskin's 
phrase passed away, so far as immediate in- 
fluence was concerned. Who took their place? 
Not immediately, nor universally indeed but, 
more than any other group, the Preraphaelites: 
that is to say, the historical ones, the Primitives, 
to use perhaps a better name. 

We all know how long the Preraphaelites, 
for the English and ourselves at least, were on 
the top of the wave as the masters par excel- 
lence. They are commonly included in the 
mind of one who looks back upon the period of 
their ascendency, under the name of Botticelli. 
It is no longer a name to conjure with. But 
what a name it was once ! The whole merit of 
the painters who preceded and accompanied 
Raphael was sublimated in that splendid name. 
It was a name of such power that under its spell 
many worthy people went through great tor- 
ment to admire what they did not like. Yet 
Botticelli was not the first, the original Pre- 
raphaelite. It was not till 1871 that Mr. Rus- 
kin startled cultivated England by pronounc- 
ing that mystic name in a tone which implied 
that everyone ought to know all about it. When 
Mr. Pater wrote of him so delightfully, he still 
had the charm of novelty. The Preraphaelite 
Brotherhood had existed long before, long be- 
fore Mr. Ruskin had perceived that they were 
but carrying out his own principles. But al- 
though called "Preraphaelite " they were really 
not actually so any more than he was: they 
cared far more for their own principles than 
for any set of painters before or after Raphael; 
indeed, that was the principle of most impor- 
tance with them. They really turned attention 
to the Primitives, and were not actually in- 
spired by them. Still, that was the important 
thing. When Mr. Ruskin began to interest 
himself in the earlier painters, his first great 
discovery was Luini. 

Thus Luini is typical of a great influence 
in art. Yet he can hardly be said to have 
been an influence himself. For one thing, 
Luini is not exactly a Preraphaelite; for an- 
other, he has often been regarded, if at all, as 



an imitator of Lionardo. Mr. Ruskin found in 
him wonderful things. It is said by Mr. Col- 
lingwood that Mr. Ruskin never said as much 
about Luini as he meant to say. This may 
be : he did go so far as to say that Luini was 
ten times as great as Lionardo, and that every 
touch that he laid was eternal. Still, Luini, 
although always immensely interesting, has 
hardly been himself an influence. 

Mr. Williamson's book on Luini is the first 
of a series projected under his editorship, a 
series which will offer valuable books to the 
student at a moderate price. The main fea- 
tures of the plan seem to be very liberal illus- 
tration (there are about forty reproductions in 
this volume and as many in the companion 
" Velasquez ") and a very careful list and de- 
scription of all the pictures known. Besides, 
there is a bibliography, and, of course, the 
life. In the case of Luini, the life is not so 
purely historical as in the book on Poussin : it 
is, however, not very artistic either ; it is in 
fact critical, and that in the school of Morelli 
on the whole. Mr. Williamson has a very 
considerable field ; there has been very little 
work done already on the subject. A great 
deal of his work is, then, extremely valuable 
as supplying what cannot be found anywhere 
else. 

It is hardly necessary to introduce a book 
on Velasquez by remarking that as the keen- 
ness of interest in the Primitives gradually 
waned, it became apparent that Velasquez was 
the man of the future. He has probably by 
this time arrived at his apogee. The man 
whose pictures remind one not only of Whistler 
and Sargent, but of Carolus Duran and Hen- 
ner, not to mention a dozen more as important, 
has done all that one can expect. Mr. Steven- 
son's book is not unnaturally written in a dif- 
ferent manner from the two others. A book 
on Poussin is almost inevitably historic or 
academic in character ; one on Luini will very 
naturally be critical even more than apprecia- 
tive ; a book on Velasquez must almost of 
course be enthusiastic and polemical. Neces- 
sary or not, that is what Mr. Stevenson is ; 
nor does the fact impair the value of his book, 
which is much the most interesting of the three 
in our present group, while its illustration is 
as adequate as that of the Luini volume, and 
its list of pictures as complete, although Mr. 
Williamson, the general editor who made it, 
disclaims the intention of being very critical 
in his attributions. It is not his especial field, 
nor, indeed, anybody else's, perhaps because 



4l>4 



THE J3IAL 



[Dec. 1, 



of the reasons urged by Mr. Stevenson. Mr. 
Stevenson is naturally no great admirer of the 
school of Morelli, and dislikes " the counting 
of curls, the measuring of thumbs, the tracing 
of poses." He has supplied a very interesting 
book, however, written from the standpoint of 
the artist and dealing with the really. artistic 
questions. It is not a matter of biography 
with him, nor of history : it is a question of 
painting. 

If one has been interested in the painting 
of this century, and is still unaware of the 
masters whose work is dealt with in these 
books, one will be surprised, on turning to 
them, to see how strong has been the influence 
of the past on our time. It has not been the 
only influence, by any means, nor is it fully 
represented in the books here noticed ; but it 
is worth knowing about. 

What are we to make of such books ? What 
is their value to one who is not a student, but 
whose aim is to enjoy the art which actually 
comes before his eyes? To those who can 
readily visit France, Italy, Spain, it will be 
perhaps a matter of importance to know some- 
thing about Poussin, Luini, Velasquez. But 
how about the rest, who rarely see much of 
anything beyond current reproductions and 
current exhibitions? It is surely a scholastic 
matter to know that this man was influenced 
by such an one, however famous ; that this 
element in his art came from this man, and 
that element from that man. Does it not with- 
draw our attention from the general impression 
of a man's power, and cultivate merely a super- 
ficial knowingness which is often content to 
dash away the possibility of deep enjoyment 
for the chance of a clever shrug of the 
shoulders? 

It may certainly do so : in fact, it does so 
with many people. But there are still reasons 
why it is well to know a good deal about the 
history of art. It is well to know that an art- 
ist is often ingenious and imitative rather than 
self-possessed and great. It is well also to 
know that fashions in art have often changed, 
and that one must have a steady head in think- 
ing of the art of one's own time. But aside 
from these two pieces of abstract knowledge, 
which may or may not be useful to one, it is 
further well to get into the habit of seeing 
what is good anywhere and making it one's 
own. And this sort of cultivation of the taste 
is rather better attained by the art of some 
time ago than by the art of to-day.

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

L 

The prodigal genius of the Prince of Painters is 
fitly symbolized in the luxurious make-up and lavish 
pictorial equipment of the two noble imperial octavo 
volumes containing Miss Elizabeth Lee's Englinh 
version of M. Ktnile Michel's " Rubens, His Life, 
His Work, and His Time" (Scribner's Importa- 
tion). This work, the companion of M. Michel's 
monumental work on Rembrandt issued some five 
years ago, must be pronounced easily and at all 
points the leader in our list of Holiday publications. 
As the biographer of Rubens, the author has had 
a far richer and ampler field of exploitation than as 
the biographer of Rembrandt, whose obscure, com- 
mon, and even dingy life as a man left behind it 
but scanty and uninviting materials for its literary 
reconstruction. Rubens, on the contrary, the (<- 
turesque and many-sided genius ; the man of travel, 
of science, of literary tastes and culture, of courtly 
adventure and gallant, chivalrous mien ; the am- 
bassador at the courts of Spain and England ; the 
friend of sovereigns and statesmen, left behind him 
the amplest store of picturesque memorials of his 
career. He touched and adorned life at many 
points; and his interest for us as man of action 
and of the brilliant world of courts and cabinets is 
scarcely secondary to his interest for us as the pro- 
fuse painter whose protean genius covered Europe 
with his auroral canvases. The very abundance of 
biographical material, the fertility of production and 
universality of gift, prove, in a way, initial diffi- 
culties with which the critic and biographer of 
Rubens, who essays to fuse in a single, comprehen- 
sive, logically-ordered " Life " the various phases 
and epochs of that multifarious career, must con- 
tend. There is hardly a term, however brief or 
vaguely defined, of Ruben's life, a phase, however 
passing, of his tireless activity, that has not been 
made the subject of a monograph. Recent scholars 
and critic-, especially Belgian, have vied in the 
pursuit of fresh discoveries touching the man and 
his works. Of these scattered and multitudinous 
writings, and of the voluminous correspondence of 
the painter, M. Michel has freely availed himself, 
quoting where necessary, digesting into his own 
terms of thought and language for the most part. 
All the galleries of Europe in which the master's 
works are to be found have been revisited, his foot- 
steps in Italy, Spain, Flanders, and especially in 
his loved city of Antwerp have been retraced. * I 
have," says M. Michel, " lived almost exclusively 
with Rubens for several years "; but, let us add, it 
is Ruben's art which is mainly and essentially his 
theme. Still less, necessarily, than in his book on 
Rembrandt has it been possible for M. Michel to 
give a complete catalogue of works. The briefest 
descriptive mention of the 1,200 paintings and 400 
drawings of this most prolific of painters would 
have alone filled the volume*. The author has 
therefore restricted himself to the mention at the

end of the book of the collections, public and private, 
containing the most numerous or most important 
examples. The illustration of these volumes is on 
the most liberal scale, and we need scarcely say 
that the appeal is to the cultivated rather than the 
popular taste. Where color is used it is used spar- 
ingly in fact there is just a hint or suggestion of 
it. There are no garish, and therefore necessarily 
false, colored plates inserted as a bait for the buyer 
of the mere u picture-book." M. Michel's book 
may fairly be termed an art-work, in the real and 
specific sense of that much abused term, which re- 
cent usage has made far too elastic. The six-penny 
magazine reprint, with its half-tone abominations, 
is nowadays styled an "art-work," and that too in 
quarters where a more discriminating choice of terms 
might be looked for. There are, in all, in the two 
volumes, forty colored plates, forty photogravures, 
and 272 text illustrations. It has been aimed to 
include, besides the inevitable and indispensable 
masterpieces, examples which, through variety of 
subject, may serve to give an idea of that universality 
which is perhaps the most striking characteristic of 
Rubens. History, landscape, portraiture, animal- 
painting, genre, still-life the brush of Rubens 
touched no branch of his art without adorning it. 
Photography has been relied on for the reproduc- 
tions, " as the process best calculated to secure 
accuracy "; and the mechanical work touches high- 
water mark in its kind. The translation is fluent 
and easy, and appears to be accurate. This fine 
work of M. Michel's deserves fuller and more 
critical treatment than can be accorded it here, for 
it is really one of scholarship, in its class, and the 
fruit of a long period of painstaking research. But 
we must content ourselves now with confidently pro- 
nouncing it a book for every student of Rubens to 
" read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest," and, if 
possible, to possess. 

Mr. C. D. Gibson's " Education of Mr. Pipp " 
(Russell) is an amusing pictorial satire, and a very 
clever thing in its way, ai-tistically. It comprises 
a series of pictures (not too conventionally Gibson- 
ian) in which is unfolded the tale of the initiation 
of Mr. Pipp, a rich but untravelled American pater- 
familias, into the doubtful joys of European travel 
and the ways of European society. The chief ini- 
tiators are Mrs. Pipp and her two lovely daughters 
(Gibson girls "down to the ground "); and these 
conspirers against Mr. Pipp's peace and purse are 
later ably abetted by Lady Fitzmaurice and son (En- 
glish tourists), a rascally courier, a dingy "Dago" 
Duke and ditto Prince, and the usual host of mil- 
liners, jewellers, etc. Mr. Pipp " does " London, 
Paris, the Riviera, Rome, etc., in the usual way ; is 
" done " by the courier, whom, however, he " polishes 
off" handsomely, d la Mr. Robert Fitzsimmons, to 
the joy and pride of his assembled womankind and 
Lady Fitzmaurice ; picks a few winners at the Der- 
by; has a "night off" at Paris, and a consultation 
of physicians next day ; breaks the bank at Monte 
Carlo ; and winds up his European tour in the mod- 



ern way by acquiring an ornamental English son- 
in-law (well-born but impecunious), to the gratifi- 
cation of Mrs. Pipp and the confusion of her social 
rivals at home. Mr. Pipp's "education" seems to 
be tolerably complete in the closing picture, wherein 
we see him dandling a pair of "kids" (one Anglo- 
American, the other unhyphenated) one on each 
knee, with grandpaternal joy. The book seems to 
us about the best thing Mr. Gibson has done so far, 
and it deserves a cordial welcome at the hands of 
his public. 

A rather attractive publication of a semi-religious 
cast is the Rev. Alexander Mackennal's " Homes 
and Haunts of the Pilgrim Fathers " (Lippincott). 
As the title implies, the interest of the book is 
mainly pictorial, though Dr. Mackennal's running 
commentary on the themes supplied by the pictures 
is in itself instructive and readable. The illustra- 
tions embrace a colored frontispiece (a view of 
Scrooby, Nottinghamshire) and ninety-three illus- 
trations in black-and-white from drawings and pho- 
tographs by Charles Whymper. Text and plates 
deal exclusively with the seats of Puritanism before 
the exodus to America, the aim of the book being 
to pictorially set before the reader buildings, places, 
objects, and portraits in England and Holland in- 
dubitably associated with the Pilgrim Fathers. 
Thus, the artist has reproduced, wherever possible, 
structures and objects of interest which it is prac- 
tically certain that the Fathers must have them- 
selves seen, and views of the towns and villages 
where they are known to have resided, and the 
buildings where they undoubtedly worshipped. The 
local views selected are mainly such as have been 
but little affected by the lapse of time, and are to- 
day much what they were in the seventeenth cen- 
tury. Drawings are given from Scrooby, Auster- 
field, Boston, Gainsborough, York, Plymouth, Stan- 
dish Hall, Southampton, and Cambridge, in Eng- 
land ; and places and buildings associated with the 
sojourn in Holland have not been slighted by the 
illustrator. The binding is of light-blue and gold, 
text and pictures are handsomely printed on calen- 
dered paper, and altogether the work forms a very 
suitable gift for a friend who rejoices in the fact 
that he (or she) is "of Puritan stock." Everyone 
has a friend of this sort nowadays. 

The luxurious appointments and taking theme of 
the Messrs. Putnams' fine royal octavo volume en- 
titled " Famous Homes of Great Britain and their 
Stories " make it one of the most imposing of the 
season's gift-books; and the list of contributors to 
the work adds something to this impression. In- 
stead of the stereotyped tale of the usual menial 
cicerone, whose manner and degree of civility are 
nicely conformed to his (or usually her) computa- 
tion of the probable size of the visitor's "tip," we 
are in this volume, as it were, " shown through" the 
several mansions described, by the titled master or 
mistress thereof, in person. For instance, our guide 
through the stately halls of Blenheim is the Duke 
of Marlborough himself, who recounts briefly its

history, and calls our attention to the more impor- 
tant of hia ancestral treasures, trophies, portraits, 
etc.; the honors of Battle Abbey are done by the 
Duchess of Cleveland ; of Holland House, by the 
Hon. Caroline Roche; of Cawdor Castle, by Vis- 
count Kmlyn ; of Penshurst, by Lady De L'Isle and 
Dudley; of Warwick Castle, by the Countess of 
Warwick ; of Ly me, by the Dowager Lady Newton ; 
and so forth. All this is very flattering to the pride 
of the aspiring reader; and it must be admitted 
that the descriptions are in each case well done, and 
with a dignity, modesty, and absence of "gush" or 
twaddle, that makes them contrast very agreeably 
with the usual performances of the mercenary guide 
and the shrine-hunting writer of travels. The book 
is beautifully illustrated with exterior and interior 
views of the stately homes described, with cuts of 
choice architectural details, family portraits, historic 
apartments, etc. The editor of the volume, Mr. A. 
H. Malan, contributes three or four of the chapters. 

The pictorial allurements and general beauty of 
manufacture of Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co.'s two- 
volume illustrated Holiday edition of Francis Park- 
man's Montcalm and Wolfe " will inevitably tempt 
to a re-perusal of the fascinating pages of this roman- 
tic picture of a most romantic phase of American 
history. We could hardly suggest a better or more 
stimulating gift for an imaginative American boy 
or youth with a spice of adventurous longing in his 
blood than these volumes, which tell so fascinatingly 
the tale of the fall of French power in Canada, and 
embody perhaps the most important of Mr. Park- 
man's histories. The illustrations comprise forty- 
one photogravure plates, mostly portraits from the 
original paintings or from rare mezzotints, and 
reproductions of contemporary prints. There are 
two good portraits of the author, one of them from 
a daguerreotype taken at the period of early man- 
hood. The bindings of sea-blue and gold are taste- 
ful, and complete an ensemble as sound as it is 
attractive. 

Purchasers of Holiday books this year will be 
strongly attracted by The Century Co.'s elegantly 
sumptuous edition of Dr. Weir Mitchell's fine 
American historical novel, " Hugh Wynne, Free 
Quaker." The good qualities of Dr. Mitchell's 
book have already been enlarged upon in our col- 
umns, and we need only comment here upon its 
present setting. The bindings of the two shapely vol- 
umes are of buff and gold. The copious illustrations 
comprise views of historic sites and buildings of old 
Philadelphia, reproduced from rare prints loaned 
by collectors for the purpose ; portraits after old 
originals; photographic plates of scenes in modern 
Philadelphia; and imaginative drawings by Mr. 
Howard Pyle. Mr. Pyle appears to much advan- 
tage in these spirited and dramatic drawings, which, 
we fancy, will elicit Dr. Mitchell's cordial approval. 
On the whole, it would be difficult, we think, to 
better this edition of Dr. Mitchell's chef-d'oeuvre 
for such we conceive it to be especially on its 
pictorial side. 



Mr. W. T. Smedley's familiar qualities as an 
illustrator find wide exemplification in the hand- 
some quarto volume containing fifty of his draw- 
ings selected from various sources, and entitled 
"Life and Character" (Harper). The pictures 
have a page apiece of explanatory text by Mr. A. 
V. S. Anthony, and Mr. Arthur Hoeber furnishes a 
few pages of introductory matter, biographical and 
eulogistic. Mr. Hoeber's praise is well bestowed. 
Mr. Smedley knows his types, is always refined and 
self-contained, and has the due degree of technical 
skill. A book that deals with every day types of 
actual life, and makes no great tax on the artist's 
fancy, can have no better illustrator than in Mr. 
Smedley the sound, conscientious and lasting Mr. 
Smedley. Text and plates are handsomely printed 
on calendered paper, and altogether the volume, with 
its soberly elegant binding of green-and-gold, is one 
of the best of the essentially pictorial ones. 

"Bohemian Paris of To- Day " (Lippincott), 
written by Mr. W. C. Morrow from notes by M. 
Edouard Cucuel, and illustrated by the latter gen- 
tleman, is a remarkably "lively" book, pictorially 
and otherwise, and should prove a joy to readers 
with a stomach for the life it depicts. In it the 
untravelled and unsophisticated person may see 
through the eyes of men who have seen it all pre- 
cisely how the volatile occupants of the monkeys' 
cage of Paris, namely, its Quartier Latin, comport 
themselves. The spectacle will amuse him or dis- 
gust him according to his years or temperament. 
" The purpose of text and pictures," says the author, 
" is to show Bohemian life in the city of Paris with- 
out any concealment," " with the frankness of a 
student," and (he assures us) " the students are the 
pets of Paris." Clearly, then, Paris suffers fools 
gladly, for Mr. Morrow's students appear to be 
mostly fools, with an agreeable dah of the black- 
guard and the cheap rake superadded. Not a few 
of the scenes described in this "frank" book will 
inspire the masculine reader with a strong desire to 
kick the actors therein, even at the i i-k of defiling 
bis boots. Take, for example, the account of the 
breaking in of a new girl model at the art school 
" a joy," Mr. Morrow artlessly assures us, " that the 
students never permit themselves to miss." " The 
new one is accompanied by two or more of her girl 
friends, who give her encouragement at the terri- 
ble moment when she disrobes. As there are no 
dressing-rooms, there can be no privacy. The stu- 
dents gather about and watch the proceedings with 
great interest, and make whatever remarks tlu-ir 
deviltry can suggest. . . . When, finally, after an 
inconceivable struggle with her shame, the girl 
plunges ahead in reckless haste to finish the job, 
the students applaud her roundly. . . . But more 
torture awaits her. It is then " (when the poor 
creature, at last completely en cueros, or " all. face " 
as the Indians say, awkwardly attempts, at the bid- 
ding of her chivalrous employers, to pose) "that the 
fiend ishness of the students rises to its greatest 
height. . . . One claims that her waist is too long

and her legs too heavy " (' is ' too heavy ) ; " another 
hotly takes the opposite view. . . . At last- she is 
made to don her hat and stockings ; and the stu- 
dents form a ring about her and dance and shout 
until she is ready to faint." All this brutal tom- 
foolery is clearly thought by Mr. Morrow to be 
" smart " and funny. On the whole, the average 
art student of the Quartier Latin, as depicted by 
Mr. Morrow, is a disagreeable blend of the cad, 
the clown, and the six-penny rou6. A chapter is 
devoted to the " Bal des Quat'z'-Arts," and another 
one to " Le Boul' Mich'"; and several classic Bo- 
hemian haunts are graphically described. The text 
is readable enough and informing enough in its small 
way, but the essential and redeeming feature of the 
book is the illustrations, which are decidedly clever 
and gratifyingly profuse. 

To come at the root of English character and 
study the national qualities that are specifically 
English, one must, as Irving wrote, "go forth into 
the country ; he must sojourn in villages and ham- 
lets; ... he must wander through parks and gar- 
dens ; along hedges and green lanes ; he must loiter 
about country churches; and cope with people in 
all their conditions, and all their habits and hu- 
mors." As a preparation for the pleasant series of 
papers comprised in his " Among English Hedge- 
rows'' (Macmillan), Mr. Clifton Johnson has fol- 
lowed literally and conscientiously the above good 
counsel. The book, with its delightful pictures, 
the spoil of the author's camera, forms the best 
substitute for an actual foot-tour in rural England 
that has fallen in our way in a long time. The con- 
tents of it have already appeared serially in various 
journals, and are well worth reprinting in this taste- 
ful volume. Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie supplies an 
introduction. 

Mr. Joel Cook's " England Picturesque and De- 
scriptive" (Henry T. Coates & Co.), is a rather 
unusually attractive specimen of the now familiar 
type of photographically illustrated literary guide- 
book. There are fifty full- page photogravures from 
original negatives, and these are excellent specimens 
of their class in every respect. The two crown 
8vo volumes are beautifully manufactured through- 
out, and should not be overlooked by the discrimi- 
nating seeker of a choice and substantial Holiday 
gift-book. Mr. Cook's itinerary shows a careful 
and intelligently conceived plan. He appears to 
have visited most of the points of prime general 
interest in England and Wales, and we should say 
that the comparatively untravelled tourist who 
wishes to lay out his time and money to the best 
possible advantage could scarcely do better than 
follow Mr. Cook's path with these beautiful and 
suggestive volumes as a guide. The work is divided 
into ten tours, with Liverpool and London as the 
main starting-points, each sub-route following the 
most approved and most profitable lines. The 
text is pleasantly interwoven with a slight running 
thread of history, legend, and local anecdote, and 
Mr. Cook's style is pleasing and animated, and well 



calculated to stimulate the reader's interest in the 
beautiful and storied regions described. A good 
map adds to the practical usefulness of the work, 
and the author has not neglected to supply the in- 
dispensable Index. 

Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. issue an illustrated 
Holiday edition, in three royal octavo volumes, of 
Carlyle's " French Revolution." The volumes are 
handsome enough to make one wonder at the re- 
markably modest price, all things considered, asked 
for them. Print and paper are good, the bindings 
are dainty and tasteful, and there are ten full-page 
plates to the volume. The portraits given are 
mostly well chosen, and several of them are after 
rare and decidedly interesting originals those of 
Rousseau and Carnot, for example. The frontis- 
piece to the set is a well-executed portrait of the 
author. Other subjects are: the Rolands (both 
plates after Lavachez), Louis XVI., Mme. du 
Barry, Mirabeau, Bailly, Lafayette, Mme. de Gen- 
lis, Marat, Pitt, Danton, St. Just, Hoche, etc. 
There are also reproductions of Flameng's " Marie 
Antoinette On the Way to Execution," and Sar- 
doux's engraving of Versailles. Altogether this is 
an excellent popular pictorial edition of Carlyle's 
masterpiece but the unaccountable lack of an 
index must be deplored. 

Mr. Frederick Simpson Coburn and Miss Mar- 
garet Armstrong, respectively the illustrator and 
the decorator of Irving's " Rip Van Winkle " and 
" Legend of Sleepy Hollow," published each in a 
volume by the Messrs. Putnam and boxed together, 
have been perhaps a thought too lavish of their 
work, especially of the marginal decorations, which 
seem to rather overwhelm and drown out the little 
square of text peeping through them. In them- 
selves, the decorative borders, which are printed in 
light-green and in sepia, are pleasing enough, as are 
the vignettes on the back of each leaf. Mr. Co- 
burn's drawings in wash are generally good in 
several cases notably good. The volumes are richly 
bound in dark-red and gilt, and paper and print are 
unexceptionable. 

A season or so ago we took occasion to praise a 
pretty book by that expert knight (or, as some 
would say, " fiend ") of the camera, Mr. Alexander 
Black, entitled " Miss America," and enriched with 
any number of portraits of that bewitching and 
racially composite young woman. This year Mr. 
Black is again to the fore with a similar and equally 
attractive book, entitled " Modern Daughters " 
(Scribner), and containing a galaxy of photographs 
of the American girl that ought to make the Ameri- 
can young man feel glad that he was born in a land 
of such golden opportunities. The portraits are 
prettily vignetted in the text, which consists of re- 
produced talks enjoyed by Mr. Black with all sorts 
of American girls the "Left-Over Girl," the 
"Gym Girl," the "Engaged Girl," the " Ddbu- 
tante," the " Club Girl," " the Bride," and so on. 
" Conversations with Various American Girls and 
One Man," is the sub-title. Mr. Black has caught 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



the mental accent and turn of speech of the fairer 
half of America's " smart set" nicely, and his pho- 
tographs are charming of course. The book is 
bright and witty, tastily got up throughout, and 
should prove one of the most popular of the lighter 
Christmas publications. The delightful readiness 
it implies on the part of our Modern Daughters to 
pose for Mr. Black and consequently for the pub- 
lic is not the least striking thing about it. 

Coaching literature receives an important and 
authoritative addition in Mr. Fair man Rogers's " A 
Manual of Coaching" (Lippincott). The subject, 
we think, has never been more thoroughly and 
scientifically treated than it is in this volume, which 
is distinctly a book for the amateur coachman who 
wishes to be absolutely au fait in all that pertains 
to his hobby. Mr. Rogers approaches his theme in 
a serious, one might almost say a reverential, spirit. 
He first sketches, in the real scientific temper, the 
evolution of the coach, from its germ in the rude 
farm-wagon of the ancient Romans, down to the 
elaborate and highly developed " Tally-ho " a 
term, by-the-by, which he warns us is not scientific- 
ally accurate, and which, therefore, is to be avoided 
by coaching men who are scrupulous in matters 
appertaining to good form. It is hardly possible 
here to do justice to the thoroughness with which 
Mr. Rogers (upon whom the mantle or many- 
caped box-coat of the elder Weller seems to have 
descended) goes into the details and technicalities 
of coaches, their varieties, accessories, and equip- 
ments. The mysteries of the harness also receive 
due attention, and the theory and practice of driv- 
ing is unfolded and illustrated in several erudite 
chapters. A whole chapter is devoted to that very 
essential topic, " The Whip and Its Use." Other 
chapters treat exhaustively of such matters as coach- 
ing dress, public coaching, road coaching, coaching 
trips, rules of the road, accidents, clubs, music for 
the horn, etc. A coaching bibliography is appended. 
The book is practically, as well as very attractively, 
illustrated, and it is got up generally in a way that 
is suggestive of the gift-book and indeed no more 
suitable one could be found for a friend of coach- 
ing, or, indeed, of generally " horsey" proclivities. 

The elegant form and sterling content of Messrs. 
Henry T. Coates & Co.'s new illustrated edition of 
Prof. J. P. Mahaffy'g "Rambles and Studies in 
Greece " make it one of the most desirable of the 
solider Holiday publications. The reprint is from 
the third and heretofore the latest edition, and con- 
tains therefore the added chapter on medieval 
Greece, together with the new notes and paragraphs 
added passim by the author with a view of increas- 
ing the value of the work as a traveller's hand- 
book and literary companion. There are thirty- 
four beautifully executed and well chosen photo- 
graphic plates showing scenes in modern Greece 
that are hallowed by classic story and association, 
architectural remains, sculptures, etc. A good map 
is a decidedly useful feature. The reader of this 
beautiful book, in which a traveller's reminiscences 



and a scholar's culture are so charmingly and prof- 
itably blended, will find Dr. Mahaffy's Byronie 
enthusiasm for the land of Pericles and Epatninon- 
das contagious and inspiring. But Dr. Mahaffy's 
enthusiasm, however, does not prevent him from 
entertaining the view that the pictures usually drawn 
of the old Greeks are highly idealized, the real 
people having been of a quite different and a much 
lower type. His estimate of the common people of 
ancient Greece coincides in some degree with the 
rather dampening opinions advanced in the Grice 
contemporaine of About. With the theory of Fal- 
lermeyer that the old Greek race utterly perished, 
the modern inhabitants being descendants of Slav- 
onic and Albanian invaders and settlers, Professor 
Mahaffy strongly disagrees; but he is careful to 
deny the charge sometimes made that he has drawn 
freely upon modern Greek life and character for 
his pictures of classic times. But we must not be 
drawn here into anything like a discussion or expo- 
sition of the theoretical side of this charming and 
popular book, which is mainly descriptive in treat- 
ment, and which aims largely to bring home to the 
reader the living features of Greece, by connecting 
them with the facts of older history. The volume, 
a tastefully bound crown 8vo, will prove an enticing 
one to the book-buyer of fastidious tastes. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. issue, at a moderate 
price, a very presentable two -volume edition of 
George Eliot's " Middle march." The type is fair, 
the binding is plain but sightly, and there are 
eighteen illustrations after drawings by Alice Bar- 
ber Stephens. The frontispiece to Volume II. is 
an etched portrait of the author. Altogether it is 
a very good edition for actual use. Miss Stephens's 
drawings seem to us for the most part decidedly 
well done and intelligently conceived. So much 
can scarcely be said in praise of Mr. Reginald 
Birch's pen-drawings in Messrs. Dodd, Mead & 
Co.'s edition of George Eliot's " Silas Marner." 
The pictures are not bad themselves, but their illus- 
trative quality is not remarkable. Otherwise, the 
volume is a decidedly pleasing one, and should 
attract new readers to the enjoyment of this fine 
novel. 

Very pretty and artistic in its kind is the flat 
large 4to volume entitled " Wild Flowers " (Stokes), 
containing twelve plates handsomely printed in tints 
after the water-color designs of Mrs. Ellis Rowan. 
Mrs. Rowan has displayed much taste in the selec- 
tion and arrangement of her subjects, her colors 
are pure and accurate, and her treatment is just 
broad enough being neither " splashy," on the 
one hand, nor finical on the other. In tine, all her 
flowers seem to lack is the perfume. The subjects 
are: Wild Honeysuckle; Cardinal Flower; Musk 
Mallow ; Monkshood ; Wild Pink ; Fringed Gen- 
tian ; Oswego Tea ; etc. The cover is of pale green 
and pearl grey delicately stamped with title in gilt 
and conventionalized flower design. 

Little variation from the familiar type is shown 
in Messrs. Houghton, Mif&in & Co.'s two-volume 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



429 



" Roman " edition of Hawthorne's " Marble Faun." 
The volumes are conveniently small, and are illus- 
trated with photographic plates of Roman and Flor- 
entine views, sculptures, etc. Gilt tops, red slip- 
covers, and bindings of cream -white with bold 
design in gilt, complete a fairly attractive exterior. 

Mr. Howard Pyle serves notice on his readers 
through the title-page of his " The Price of Blood " 
(R. G. Badger & Co.), that the tale is to be consid- 
ered an " extravaganza." Certainly it is a sorry 
piece of nonsense, suggestive of nothing save a des- 
perate effort on Mr. Pyle's part to be as nonsensi- 
cal as possible. And nonsense that is obviously 
labored is seldom amusing. As a vehicle for the 
grotesque drawings that accompany it the story 
does very well ; and that we dare say is what it is 
intended for. But it is a pity to find so capital an 
illustrator of the whimsical and bizarre as Mr. Pyle 
is wasting time spinning out poor extravaganzas of 
his own to illustrate, when there are so many good 
ones by others ready to his pencil. We should very 
much like to see, for example, what Mr. Pyle would 
make of von Chamisso's " Peter Schlemihl " that 
strange mingling of pathos and folly. The scene 
of Mr. Pyle's " extravaganza " is laid in New York, 
temp. 1807. The hero is Nathaniel Griscombe, a 
young attorney-at-law with no practice, and a turn 
for conviviality. Griscombe's threadbare and com- 
monplace fortunes become suddenly entangled with 
the lurid and tragic or tragico-comic ones of 
a deposed East Indian Rajah who holds his court 
secretly on Broadway, who is pursued by the ven- 
geance of " an Oriental Potentate," and who has a 
brother (also " pursued ") named " Michael Des- 
mond " (!) living at Bordentown, N. J. The Rajah 
becomes a client of Griscombe's, confides to him his 
secret and a hat-box full of jewels and then fol- 
lows the nonsense, " clotted " and plenty of it, and 
for the most part unredeemed by the light and 
whimsical fancy that make Mr. Pyle's illustrations 
so delightful. The pictures in this very attractively 
manufactured volume are printed in colors, and the 
showy frontispiece is in the artist's best style. 

Marion Harland's facile pen has been well em- 
ployed in the little biographies of Charlotte Bronte 
and William Cowper, which form the initial volumes 
of Messrs. Putnams' promising series of studies of 
the home-life of certain writers and thinkers, col- 
lectively entitled "Literary Hearthstones." The 
volumes are shapely 16mos, containing, with pre- 
face and index, some 320 liberally margined and 
clearly printed pages, and a liberal sprinkling of well- 
chosen illustrations. The bindings are pretty and 
appropriate, and while not strikingly ornate, they 
are enough so to suggest the gift-book. The au- 
thor's treatment of her theme is popular, yet by no 
means merely " gossippy " or trifling. Her aim is 
to show what the subjects of her studies were, rather 
than what they did to portray them familiarly as 
men and women, rather than as members of the 
guild of authors. It is, more specifically, the domes- 
tic side, the " Hearthstone" side, of their lives that 



she chiefly delineates and how touching and es- 
sential this side was in the gentle, home-keeping 
Cowper's case we all know. In fine, these pretty 
and unassuming books contain much pleasant and 
wholesome reading, and they form an exceptionally 
suitable Holiday gift of the modester sort. 

This season's addition to the pretty and tiny 
volumes of the " Thumb-Nail Series " (Century 
Co.), comprises "Meditations of Marcus Aurelius," 
selected and translated by Mr. Benjamin E. Smith ; 
and "Rip Van Winkle and the Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow" (together in one volume), with an Intro- 
duction by the public's good friend and sterling 
entertainer, Mr. Joseph Jefferson. The first-named 
volume is a really delectable little casket of gems 
the miniature embodiment of a specially happy 
thought for which we are indebted, we presume, to 
its judicious and scholarly editor. Mr. Smith's 
version is unusually easy and fluent accurate and 
scholarly, yet a suitable one for popular reading. 
The tinted double frontispiece shows both sides of 
an old coin bearing the head of this noblest of all 
wearers of the Imperial purple in profile. The 
Irving volume is also a pretty one outwardly, with 
its tinted title-page, and frontispiece showing the 
pathetic figure of the returned sleeper of the Catskills. 

Under the new title, "Historic Mansions and 
Highways around Boston," Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. issue a revised edition of Mr. Samuel Adams 
Drake's useful and exhaustive local guide-book orig- 
inally entitled " Old Landmarks and Historic Fields 
of Middlesex." In its revised form the book is, for 
the modern reader, a great improvement on its 
original, the practical value of which had become 
impaired through changes wrought by time and 
municipal progress, on the face of the storied dis- 
trict described. With a view of making the descrip- 
tions in the volume correspond with present condi- 
tions, the old places have been revisited, and, where 
necessary, redescribed. An added feature of import- 
ance is the very interesting illustrations, comprising 
twenty-two full-page plates and a liberal number of 
text cuts on wood. The pictures add much to the 
usefulness and attractiveness of the book, which 
forms an excellent guide to this region so rich in 
historic shrines and landmarks. It is, as Longfellow 
wrote of it in the seventies, " a perfect store-house 
of information." 

A novel, thoroughly artistic, and delightfully man- 
ufactured little book is Mr. Ernest Seton-Thompson's 
" The Trail of the Sandhill Stag " (Scribner ) . The 
story is a capital one a hunter's yarn with an 
infusion of poetry, and a touching, finely conceived 
denouement. The hunter, in fact, as the tale ends, 
is so struck by the majesty, the pathetic mute ap- 
peal as a fellow-creature, as a dumb sharer in the 
common life that binds us to the lowest forms of it, 
of the noble beast that after years of fruitless track- 
ing stands at last helpless before the muzzle of his 
rifle, that he forbears to fire, and relinquishes for- 
ever the " Trail of the Sandhill Stag." " Go, now," 
he says, " without fear of me. ... I have learned

what Buddha learned. I shall never see you again." 
The author's full-page drawings are charmingly and 
(from the naturalist's point of view) faithfully done, 
and the tiny thumb-nail sketches deer-tracks, In- 
dian signs, bits of snowy landscape, etc. scattered, 
not too lavishly, on the margins have a good effect. 
To Mrs. Grace Gallatin Seton-Thompson; is due the 
no small credit for the general design of the volume. 

Decidedly clever and " catchy " in its literary 
and material ground plan, as well as pictorial ly 
pleasing, is Mr. James L. Ford's " Cupid and the 
Footlights" (Stokes), with illustrations and decora- 
tions by Mr. Archie Gunn. This unique piece of 
Christmas bric-a-brac rather baffles description ; and 
we advise the reader to examine it for himself. 
However, Mr. Ford's story is told in a series of 
letters, telegrams, and press-clippings, given in fac- 
simile, what are supposed to be the original docu- 
ments being pasted to the leaves, in scrap-book 
fashion, of the flat 4 to volume. Mr. G nun's full- 
page drawings are appropriately interspersed. Mr. 
Ford's dramatis persona are a lot of sprightly and 
very "up-to-date" young people whose love affairs 
and notions of each other's pursuits and identities 
get tangled up in an amusing way, and are finally 
unsnarled much to their own and the reader's satis- 
faction. We get a glimpse of the gayer and slightly 
Bohemian side of New York life, and the letters of 
the stage-people are amusingly spiced with the argot 
of the fairer half of the " profession." Mr. Ford's 
touch is light and graceful, and he is evidently very 
much at home in the world whereof he writes. It 
is decidedly a publication that the finrde-si&cle young 
man and young woman should not overlook. 

The wide range and good quality of the extracts 
contained in the twin volumes "In Friendship's 
Name" and "What Makes A Friend " (Brentano's), 
and the fine quality of their paper and typography, 
should commend them to seekers of gift-books who 
care little for gay bindings and showy pictorial 
attractions. Mr. Volney Streamer is the compiler, 
and he has selected and strung bis pearls of thought 
on the prolific theme of friendship with unusual 
taste and judgment. The scope of selection is wide, 
ranging from the great masters of prose and verse, 
down to the lesser and more familiar lights of our 
own time who have contributed their mite of strik- 
ing thought or phrase concerning the sentiment that 
Montaigne styles " the highest degree of perfection 
in society." These chastely manufactured volumes 
are bound in pliable covers of vellum, and will be 
found edifying to read and useful to refer to. 

The fine artistic fancy and skill of execution of 
Mr. Walter Crane are well displayed in Messrs. R. 
G. Badger & Co.'s attractive Holiday publication 
entitled " The Sirens Three." Script and decora- 
tions are printed in uniform light sepia on rather 
thick paper of medium smoothness. Mr. Crane's 
work is quite elaborate, and is informed, we think, 
with a somewhat more serious and symbolical spirit 
than usual. At any rate it well repays close inspec- 
tion, and it makes the well-made volume containing 



it the choicest and most really artistic of the season's 
more inexpensive publications. 

Books on stage folk are usually sure of their 
welcome ; and Mr. Lewis C. Strang's " Famous 
Actresses of the Day in America" (L. C. Page & 
Co.) is one of those which will deserve it. Mr. 
Strang modestly disclaims having secured " any 
great amount of new matter " regarding the careers 
of his thirty-one heroines, and acknowledges him- 
self a compiler and editor in so far as biographical 
details are concerned. His facts have been gleaned 
from newspapers and magazines in some cases 
from the actresses themselves. The sketches are 
necessarily brief (there are only 360 pages, index 
included, in the little volume), and there is a modi- 
cum of criticism. Each sketch, however, suffices to 
inform the reader in a general way who its heroine 
is and whence she came, what are her best parts 
and what her salient characteristics. Mr. Strang 
writes pleasantly and intelligently, and with due 
sympathy with his theme. There are twenty-five 
portraits, including those of Miss Maude Adams, 
Miss Marlowe, Annie Russell, Maxine Elliott, Ada 
Rehan, Viola Allen, Julia Arthur, Effie Shannon, 
Marie Burroughs, May Robson, etc. All are stage- 
favorites of to-day. The cover, in white and gold, 
is a notably dainty one. 

The points of interest described in Mr. Charles 
Hemstreet's "Nooks and Corners of Old New 
York " (Scribner) lie in that tangled maze of streets 
and alleys that bewilder the provincial pilgrim to 
the lower and historic part of the Island of Man- 
hattan. Mr. Hemstreet is clearly an oracle on the 
ancient history, actual, legendary, and topograph- 
ical, of this swarming and not always delectable 
district of Gotham, and his method of imparting 
information is terse and practical. The little work 
is a good one for the reader who wants to make 
the most, especially in the shrine-hunting way, of a 
ramble through the region treated. Mr. Peixotto's 
pen-drawings are clever and instructive, and the 
book is decoratively bound. 

Mr. Seumas MacManus's pretty volume of tales 
of Irish folk-lore, entitled "In Chimney Corners" 
(Doubleday & McClure Co.), has the right Celtic 
smack. There is just the least touch of the brogue 
indicated in the spelling, and the wit is genuine 
and as different from the article purveyed in the 
comic papers, and popularly thought to be Irish wit, 
as " Mr. Dooley's " turn of speech and humor is 
from that of his bog-trotting ancestors. There are 
sixteen tales, all replete with the arch fun and art- 
less fancies of the quick-witted, nimble-tongued 
imaginative peasant of Erin. Miss Pamela Colinan 
Smith's bright-colored illustrations are highly deco- 
rative and sympathetic just the sort that Paddy " 
himself would approve in their present setting. 

Marion Harland's "Some Colonial Homesteads 
and Their Stories " is now followed by a kindred 
and companion volume entitled " More Colonial 
Homesteads and Their Stories" (Putnam). The 
present work treats of such interesting and storied

old mansions as Johnson Hall, Johnstown, N. Y. ; 
La Chaumiere Du Prairie, near Lexington, Ky. ; 
the two Schuyler Homesteads, Albany, N. Y. ; the 
Carroll Homestead, Maryland ; Belmont Hall, near 
Smyrna, Del. ; Langdon and Wentworth Homes, 
Portsmouth, N. H. ; etc. The author has in each 
case visited the seat described, and has spared no 
pains in making minute and pers6nal research into 
its history and archives. The book has a certain 
value as a chronicle of Colonial times and manners, 
and its attractive pictorial features and handsome 
appearance generally make it a suitable gift-book. 
There are eighty illustrations, comprising views of 
the homes described, portraits, coats-of-arms, his- 
toric apartments, pieces of Colonial furniture, etc. 

" The Romance of Our Ancient Churches " (Dut- 
ton) is an account, sympathetically written, of the 
earlier structures of Great Britain erected for 
ecclesiastical purposes, by Miss Sarah Wilson, with 
an abundance of illustrations by Mr. Alexander 
Ansted. The churches dealt with are rather the 
smaller parish houses of worship than the well- 
known cathedrals ; but the flavor of romance and 
antiquity is none the less strong. It is a matter of 
surprise to find so many Saxon foundations still 
surviving as meeting-places for the faithful, and it 
shows the strength of the hold the old church has 
on the English heart. 

"For Thee Alone" (Dana Estes & Co.) is the 
melting, if not very explicit, title of an anthology 
of love-poems compiled by Miss Grace Hartshorne. 
Miss Hartshorne has aimed ''to present a selection of 
the best poems of love and lovers in the English lan- 
guage, as well as a few notable translations." In 
this aim she appears to us to have succeeded very 
well indeed, her list of poets and titles displaying due 
refinement as well as catholicity of taste. The older 
masters of verse are suitably represented, and there 
is a liberal sprinkling of the later and the humbler 
poets Mr. Whitcomb Riley, Miss Thaxter, Phoebe 
Gary, Mr. Samuel Minturn Peck, Miss Thomas, etc. 
The volume is a small one, (283 pp.), and seems 
especially so when we consider the wide field of 
selection from which its contents are culled. It is 
a notably pretty and dainty one outwardly, well 
printed, and delicately bound in pale blue with cover 
ornament in lavender and sea-green. A rather effec- 
tive and original feature is the sixteen illustrations 
consisting of half-tone reproductions of paintings by 
artists mostly modern Alma Tadema, Edouard 
Bisson, Tito Conti, W. Menzler, N. Sichel, F. 
Andreotti, etc. The connection of pictures with 
text is of course rather vague and fanciful ; but 
they serve the end of beautifying the book and 
making it an attractive and a suitable one for a gift. 

Another attractive, but in range of authors some- 
what less comprehensive, anthology of poems of 
love is entitled " For Love's Sweet Sake " (Lee & 
Shepard). The editor is Mr. G. Hembert Westley, 
and his selections in the present volume evince the 
same good taste shown in its predecessor and com- 
panion, " Because I Love You." Mr. Westley 



apparently inclines, as a compiler at least, to the 
more modern and the more easily appreciated poets ; 
and we should say that as a particularly " fetching " 
gift-book the young man in search of a Christmas 
token for the object of his affections will scarcely 
find anything better or more eloquent of the state 
of his heart and the seriousness of his " intentions " 
than this book of Mr. Westley's. The essential 
fact that " Barkis is willin' " lurks in its very title. 
The text is clearly printed on moderately glazed 
paper, and there is a sprinkling of illustrations, 
full-page and marginal. The chaste binding of 
white, light-blue, and gold calls for special praise. 

" Historic Towns of the Middle States," which 
forms Volume II. of the Messrs. Putnams' useful 
" American Historic Towns " series, presents mono- 
graphs on Albany, Saratoga, Schenectady, New- 
burgh, Tarrytown, Brooklyn, New York, Buffalo, 
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Princeton, Wilmington. 
The general Introduction is by Dr. Albert Shaw, 
who points out some interesting special facts in the 
early history and colonization of the Middle States, 
notably the mixed and cosmopolitan character of 
their original population, which served to differen- 
tiate them pretty sharply from the other two sec- 
tions, and to make them, as it were, a useful buffer 
between the morally and socially rather antagon- 
istic groups of New England States and Southern 
States. Dr. Shaw's observations are interesting, 
and we should like to see them more fully devel- 
oped. The several authors have made the most of 
the limited space at their disposal, and the volume 
is both readable aud instructive. It is handsomely 
printed and contains over 150 illustrations. 

" Shakespeare's Sonnets " are obviously and not 
unpleasingly exploited for pictorial and decorative 
purposes by Mr. Henry Ospovat, in the square little 
volume of them published by Mr. John Lane. The 
spirit of pre-Raphaelitism has entered Mr. Ospovat 
to some extent, and his bold wood-cuts are quite in 
the neo-mediaeval, church-window style of Morris 
and the rest. The full page plates, of which there 
are a dozen or so, recall very forcibly the work of 
the brothers Rhead, which was strongly in evidence 
last season. The text is handsomely printed on 
rather thick cream-tinted paper, and the cover is of 
buff and gold. The book is artistic, and should 
form an unexceptionable gift. 

For a low-priced yet sound and tasteful gift-book, 
nothing better could be selected than a volume 
of the "Copley Series" (Crowell), which com- 
prises " Abbe* Constantin," Kipling's " Barrack- 
Room Ballads," " Cranford," " Evangeline," " Hia- 
watha," " The House of the Seven Gables," Mere- 
dith's " Lucille," and Curtis's " Prue and I." The 
text is printed on good deckle-edge paper with lib- 
eral margins, and the bindings show a notably 
tasteful design in dark -green with floriated gold 
borders. The colored illustrations have a pleasing 
effect, and, altogether, the volumes must be pro- 
nounced of marvellously good quality, considering 
the low price asked for them.

BOOKS FOR THK YOUNG. 

L 

First of all the reflections we children of a 
larger growth are likely to have on looking 
over the long lists of books for the young 
is the great number of the better books. While there 
are quite as many of the other sort as there used to be, 
the enormous increase in the number of volumes in- 
tended for the oncoming generation is made up from 
tales and picture-books of a sort wholly unknown thirty 
years ago. With this goes a consciousness of many 
world-movements, all the noisier ones, in fact, the 
echoes of which come back from the children's world. 
War is dominant in their reading matter, almost to the 
exclusion of the healthier excitement of travel and ad- 
venture. Historical tales are evidently popular with 
the youngsters, as with their elders ; and of all the 
various kinds of these, topics taken from colonial days 
are most in vogue. Just as the man of complex civili- 
zation turns most lovingly to nature, so the American 
who is leaving the simplicity of his national life behind 
him harks back to the more natural days when the na- 
tion was still in swaddling clothes. But one difference 
is to be noted: the gentler sex is said to dominate the 
fiction for the adult reading population, and the novel 
which makes no appeal to womankind is said to be fore- 
doomed. Among these works for children and youth, 
on the contrary, boys' books are greatly in the majority. 
It may be that girls like boys' books better than those 
originally intended for themselves, while girls' books 
make no corresponding appeal to their brothers; still, 
a more likely solution comes to the same end, in the 
assumption that here too the little woman is doing the 
work of the little man, as in so many other things in 
real life. 

Stories of school and college are numerous 
and wholesome. "Stalky & Co." (Double- 
<md college. d&y), from the pen of Mr. Rudyard Kip- 
ling, is the sincerest of these, since it goes to the pains 
of showing the boy as he is rather than the boy as his 
parents would have him. The ignoring of the evolu- 
tionary idea that the individual repeats in himself the 
history of the race is one of the troubles with most 
children's reading matter, as anyone may prove who 
will go back to the " Eric, or Little by Little " of Canon 
Farrar, which Stalky and his companions so detest. 
English schools are healthy in sentiment, and give the 
youthful savage scope for his savagery, as in the present 
instance; and the fact that it contains an autobiography 
of the author as a lad heightens the value of it. "The 
Adventures of a Freshman " (Scribner) is written by 
Mr. Jesse Lynch Williams to tell what may befall a 
healthy young countryman during his first year at 
Princeton, proving that boys gain by temptations, if they 
are the right kind of boys "The Half Back" (Apple- 
ton), by Mr. Ralph H. Harbour, is a tale of a fitting 
school and of the freshman year in Harvard, thinly 
disguised as "Harwell." Similarly, "Ward Hill at 
College" (A. J. Rowland), by Dr. Everett T. Tomlin- 
son, deals with life in Rutgers, the name of that re- 
spectable foundation being sufficiently apparent in the 
anagram "Tegrus." All these have a lot of Rugby 
football in them, while Mr. Harbour's volume treats of 

golf as well "Cattle Ranch to College" (Doubleday) 

is by Mr. Russell Doubleday, and portrays a boy too 
busy earning an honest living to go in for athletics, 
though he wins a bicycle race at just the right time. 



Tain of var 
and action. 



Mr. Rupert Hughes's "The Dozen from Lakerim" 
(Century) is almost exclusively athletic, with more of 
track and team events to distinguish it from its fellows. 
There is a thesis underlying these stories 

of the ^J* at 8cbo l and . oo^S". abl - v (it " 
f ended by all these writers except Mr. 
Kipling, to the effect that athletics increase the capacity 
for school work, and eminence in both is attained quite 
as readily as eminence in either. Yet the books which 
deal with girls in school and college show nothing of 
this tendency, for all the woman's athletics and golfing. 
Miss Frances Freiot Gilbert, in "The Annals of My 
College Life" (Lee), provides an illustrated blank- 
book (to use a seeming paradox) wherein, as she says, 
girls may record the " bright features of student days." 
She provides for " My Arrival," " My Chums," " My 
Spreads," and the like, but not for " My Athletic Suc- 
cesses." In " Beck's Fortune " (Lee), Miss Adele E. 
Thompson turns the interest attaching to her school- 
girl in romantic directions, the story being both strong 
and wholesome. And in "The Boys and Girls of 
Brantham " (Little, Brown, & Co.) Miss Evelyn Ray- 
mond depicts a coeducational military academy in 
which both sexes drill with fervor, but fails to make 
athletes of either her boys or girls. The book, for all 
its incipient militarism, with all our American girls po- 
tential Molly Starks, is exciting ; a crime and the sus- 
picions it gives rise to heightening the interest. 

How much work is done by men of letters 
to-day in comparison with an earlier day, 
illustrating the high pressure under which 
we moderns have to work, is best proved by the new 
publications of Mr. George Alfred Henty, already suf- 
ficiently well known to have a class of literature, the 
" Henty books," named from him. His methods are 
simple and natural, though he deals with the more ex- 
citing events of history, and therefore leans away from 
the normal always. This method consists in taking an 
historical episode of sufficient consequence^ and weav- 
ing into it the fortunes of a boy. Three of his new 
books are published by Scribner, and of these " Won by 
the Sword " deals with the Thirty Years' War, " No Sur- 
render" is concerned with the rising in La Vende*e, and 
" A Roving Commission " treats of the black insurrec- 
tion in Hayti. Another of his stories, "The Brahmin's 
Treasure, or Colonel Thorndike's Secret " (Lippincott), 
is more of a novel than the others, and for boys some- 
what older; while a fifth volume bearing the Henty 
name is " Yule Tide Yarns " (Longmans), in which Mr. 
Henty furnishes the first story, its companions coming 
from pens as competent as those of Messrs. Bloudelle- 
I '.Mi-ton. David Ker, George Manville Fenn, and others. 
These novels are distinctly historical, and of value on 
that account, apart from the interesting manner in 
which they are set forth With them goes Mr. Henry 
Newbolt's "Stories from Froissart" (Macmillan). 
Unlike Sidney Lanier in his "Boy's Froissart," Mr. 
Newbolt takes most of his narrative directly from the 
pages of Lord Berners's great translation, though it is 
greatly abridged, even in comparison with the other. 
" The Story of Magellan " (Appleton) of Mr. Hezekiah 
Butterworth is pleasant to read, as anything dealing 
with a life so full of wonders must be. It has added 
interest at the present time because of the great navi- 
gator's connection with the Philippines. Mr. Henry 
St. John uses Sir Francis Drake in a similar manner in 
"The Voyage of the Avenger" (L. C. Page & Co.), 
which has to do with the Spanish Inquisition and other

matters of more or less fascination Mrs. Molly Elliot 
Seawell leaves America for a time to follow a young 
French-English-Scotchman, " Gavin Hamilton " (Har- 
per), through the wars between Maria Theresa and 
Frederick the Great. It makes excellent reading 
So does Mr. O. V. Caine's " In the Year of Waterloo " 
(A. I. Bradley), a book of good fighting, opening with 
the somewhat usual "sound of revelry by night." 
American The books which deal with the past of 
hittory to tht America, from days very remote to those 
Revolution. quite recent, are well nigh innumerable. 
"The Treasure Ship" (Appleton), also by Mr. Heze- 
kiah Butterworth, has to do with Sir William Phipps 
and his lucky find (which, like a number of other 
things worth having, was not so much luck as good 
sense) and the American regicides. "The Boys of 
Scrooby" (Houghton), by Miss Ruth Hall, goes back 
to an earlier period still, having to do with Captain 

John Smith first, and then with the Mayflower " Fife 

and Drum at Louisbourg " (Little, Brown, & Co.) is a 
pleasant story of a pair of Yankee twins during the 
French War, by Mr. J. Macdonald Oxley ; and " The 
Young Puritans in Captivity " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
the third of the " Young Puritan " series written by 
Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith, treats of the fortunes of 
Prudence Ellis and Submit Carter, who were carried 
away from Hadley in King Philip's war. Another 
tale of King Philip's war is Mr. Edward S. Ellis's 
"Uncrowning a King" (Penn Publishing Co.). The 
hero does wonders, but modern sympathy goes out 
to the unfortunate Philip nevertheless. Coming 
down to Revolutionary times, Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks 
makes a very good book indeed of " In Blue and 
" White " (Lothrop), which has to do with a member 
of General Washington's Life-Guard. " A Jersey Boy 
in the Revolution" (Houghton), by Dr. Everett T. 
Tomlinson, reminds us that New Jersey was a scene of 
constant struggle during the earlier days of our inde- 
pendence, and is correspondingly engrossing to those 
who like war's alarums Colonel Charles Ledyard 
Norton strikes the note we used not to hear at all, in 
" The Queen's Rangers " (Wilde), in which some Amer- 
ican boys take service with Britain in New York, and 

later desert to the patriot cause " The Minute Boys 

of Bunker Hill" (Dana Estes) is by Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer, a slight but not uninteresting tale ; and 
"A Revolutionary Maid" (Wilde), by Miss Amy E. 
Blanchard, begins in New York, when the old statue 
on the Battery was pulled down by the Liberty Boys, 
and goes through Valley Forge. It has a pleasant little 
romance woven in it. 

" On Fighting Decks in 1812 " (Dana 

iMWar. Estes ) is bv Mr ' F - H - Costello, and takes 
us down to the second war for independ- 
ence. The hero of the book is in sufficiently good luck 
to be on the " Constitution " under Commodore Hull 
when she meets the " Guerrie're," and on the same gal- 
lant ship under Commodore Bainbridge when she met 
the " Java." It is good reading " Midshipman 
Stuart, or The Last Cruise of the Essex " (Scribner) 
could be made more realistic by the use of less end-of- 
the-century slang, and it is not as well-told a narrative 
as others of Mr. Kirk Munroe's " Captain Tom the 
Privateersman " (Dana Estes) is by Mr. James Otis, 
aud sets forth the adventures of a boy on the brig 
"Chasseur," which was one of the best fighting ships 
America ever sailed under her flag, and abundantly 
deserving all the recognition possible. The Civil War 



shows somewhat desultorily in " Henry in the War, or 
The Model Volunteer " (Lee & Shepard), by General 
O. O. Howard. It is a sequel to his former book for 
boys, and contains an interesting glance at West Point 
in a day now remote A semi-historical book relating 
to the Rebellion is "On General Thomas's Staff" 
(McClurg), the second of the sort from the pen of Mr. 
Byron A. Dunn. It is undoubtedly readable, and con- 
tains some spirited pictures of events among our fight- 
ing armies in the great Southwest " An Undivided 
Union " (Lee & Shepard) is the last new publication 
which will ever bear the name of " Oliver Optic," the 
late William T. Adams, though it owes its completion 
to Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, who has evidently made a 
study of his predecessor's methods, since he follows 
them closely in his original books as well as in this. It 
is a tale of Kentucky fighting, ending with Chicka- 
mauga, and abounds in the sort of incident which won 
Mr. Adams a sale of two million volumes for his vari- 
ous books, a sale which shows no signs of abatement. 
From Cuba The war with Spain and associated events 
to the is not the mainspring of as much action in 

PMippintt. this sort of reading-matter as it was a year 
ago. "Forward March!" (Harper) is a well-told tale 
of deeds about Santiago, by Mr. Kirk Munroe, in 
which the Rough Riders appear for the sixth or seventh 
time in books " Cleared for Action " (Dutton), by 
Mr. Willis Boyd Allen, has to do with the navy, and is 
also worth reading Mr. James Otis adds two slender 
volumes to his " Stories of American History " (Dana 
Estes) with " Off Santiago with Sampson " and " When 
Dewey Came to Manila." Necessarily, the young men 
in the former book were not on the " New York," for 
they contrived to take part in the sea-fight of July third, 
and the father of one of them was on the " Brooklyn." 
Mr. Rossiter Johnson prepares an excellent account 
of Admiral Dewey, both as a young man on the Missis- 
sippi and in his later exploits, with the title of " The 
Hero of Manila" (Appleton). It is profusely illus- 
trated. "Two American Boys in Hawaii" (Dana Estes) 
leads up to the actual scenes of annexation in Honolulu, 
and Mr. G. Waldo Browne tells the story convincingly 
and well. The same author also goes back to the 
struggle between Massachusetts and New Hampshire 
for the debatable ground between them in 1740 and the 
succeeding years, and "The Woodranger" (Page) is 
the pleasing and instructive result. The indefatigable 
Mr. Stratemeyer brings his " Old Glory " series down 
to date with " Under Otis in the Philippines, or a Young 
Officer in the Tropics" (Lee & Shepard), in which 
Americans have the melancholy pleasure of reading of 
the undoubted bravery of their soldiers exhibited in a 
war with men fighting for liberty. Finally, a tolerably 
complete survey of our greatness in men of many kinds 
appears in the brief and admirably designed series of 
" Historic Americans " (Crowell), by Mr. Eldridge S. 
Brooks.

the tales or war just enumerated are not 

intended for girls, unless these are so much nearer 
barbarism that their taste for bloody scenes or bloody 
deeds is not yet effaced. It is to be noted generally, 
however, that the real horrors of war, the inevitable 
facts which make it, as General Sherman said, " hell," 
are glossed over by all the writers mentioned, and only 
its splendors, as set apart from its horrors, are permitted 
to appear. Even in the tales of the Revolution, when

the American cause was just and aided in the causa of 
human freedom, there is a tendency to minimize the 
justice of the cause in favor of the glory of mere courage 
on the scene of battle afloat or ashore. This must ap- 
peal to the lower instincts of boys; and we like to think 
that the girls, at least, have no share in it. But the 
rest of the books for boys are for the most part whole- 
some and hearty, when they are not most interestingly 
instructive. In this last class, "The Boy's Book of 
Inventions " (Doubleday), by Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, 
must be given very high rank indeed, and it is difficult 
to imagine anyone who will not be fascinated by the 
wonders it describes Also dealing with mechanics and 
its kindred topics is ' Dorsey, the Young Inventor " 
(Fords, Howard & Hulbert), by Mr. Edward S. Ellis. 
The author makes use of the boy's genius to pay off a 
mortgage, which is not particularly original with him, 
but makes the book a desirable one nevertheless. 
"The Young BOM" (Crowell), by Mr. Edward William 
Thompson, also treats of some engineering feats, and is 
a pleasant account of difficulties overcome. 

Among the few books of travels in the 
usual sense of the word is Mr. Paul Du 
Chaillu's "The Land of the Long Night" 
(Scribner). This deals with experiences, some of them 
downright hardships, in the Scandinavian peninsula, and 
has the intimate knowledge of children's tastes and 
fancies which characterize this writer's earlier works. 
Another tale of life in high latitudes is the " Winter 
Adventures of Three Boys in the Great Lone Land " 
(Eaton & Mains), by Mr. Egerton R. Young. The land 
in question is Labrador, and the Hudson Bay Company's 
men provide the other persons of the story. A third 
volume from the busy pen of Dr. Everett T. Tomlinson 
is " Camping on the St. Lawrence, or On the Trail of 
the Early Discoverers " (Lee & Shepard). In the last 
vacation before entering college, four boys go into the 
wilderness which the French had passed through cen- 
turies before, and have the sort of time which men try 
to have when they go off camping. " To Alaska for 
Gold " (Lee & Shepard) deals with the recent dis- 
coveries of precious metals along the Yukon, and Mr. 
Stratemeyer, though be gives his young men consider- 
ably better fortune than most of the prospectors have 
had in the Klondike, still paints the difficulties of that 
remote region. Hunting, rather than travel, makes up 
the argument in "Grant Burton the Runaway" (Lee 
& Shepard), wherein Mr. W. Gordon Parker carries on 
the adventures of the boys he introduced his readers to 
last year, with some additions. The story has a fine 
manly tone Another book devoted to the search for 
gold, in the Rocky Mountains this time, is " The Treas- 
ure of Mushroom Rock" (Putnam), by Mr. Sid ford F. 
Hamp. And still another is " The Young Goldseekers" 
(Penn Publishing Co.), by Mr. Edward S. Ellis, Alaska 
being the scene of the treasure hunting. How easy it 
is to find the end of the rainbow in books! 

More stories than one have been woven 
of ton*?* *round the Victoria Cross, and many more 
will continue to be told of the deeds of 
valor which it rewards. " Tom Graham, V.C." (Nel- 
son), by Mr. William Johnson, is the latest of these, 
and tells us how Tom was able to distinguish himself in 
the Afghan war to his heart's content " Jack the Young 
Ranchman" (Stokes), from the pen of Mr. William 
Bird Grinnell, is a pleasant medley of Indians, Rocky 
Mountains, and boys on a ranch, with adventure and 
enterprise apparent on every page. A serious accident 



to one of "The Boys of Marniton I'raine" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.), by Miss Gertrude Smith, and the good 
that eventually Hows from it, make excellent reading; 
while " The Voyage of the Pulo Way " ( Fenno) is as sen- 
sational as Mr. Carlton Dawe knows how to make a 
boy's book, with piracy and fighting around the Philip- 
pine islands among its incidents. A curious mingling of 
unusual information and mishap is " The Golden Talis- 
man " (Wilde), by Mr. H. Phelps Whitntanh. It con- 
tains an account of a young captive who supplies a 
scentless kingdom with all manner of agreeable per- 
fumes, to the delight of all concerned. "Captain 
Kodak " (Lothrop) is a camera story, and the proficiency 
of Mr. Alexander Black, its author, is shown by the 
illustrations reproducing photographs he has taken. It 
is what boys with a tendency for picture-making will ask 
for. Mr. William Drysdale has done a difficult thing 
very well in his " Helps for Ambitious Boys " (Crowell). 
He takes up various handicrafts successively, pointing 
out their respective merits, adds to it accounts of the 
learned professions so called, and produces a book which 
will be a real assistance to boys and their parents both: 
a thing frequently attempted and seldom carried out to 
anything like a successful conclusion. 

What a pleasant picture of a lad's happi- 

68t d *7* in Scotland Mr> S - R - Crockett 
gives in " Kit Kennedy, Country Boy " 
(Harper), returning to an earlier (and better) manner t 
And the truths in his pages, which give a man that 
curious start, as if he had renewed his youth for a mo- 
ment, are told in another form, of American boys in a 
Western country town, by Mr. William Allen White in 
"The Court of Boyville" (Doubleday). Mr. White's 
boys do not get as old as Kit, and they are correspond- 
ingly free from the finalities; but they are all the more 
real. Mr. Orson Lowell's illustrations in the American 
book are just what is needed to finish the picture. A 
book which every boy can read to his profit, in more 
senses than one, is Mr. William O. Stoddard's " I'lrio 
the Jarl " (Eaton & Mains). Daring, but not improb- 
able, is the conception that the penitent thief was a 
viking from the north; and the book has real merit. 
Of an older fashion is Mr. Harry Castlemon's " The 
White Beaver" (Coates), where there are crimes and 
retributions galore. With this goes another long familar 
name, that of Mr. Horatio Alger, Jr., with "Rupert's 
Ambition" (Coates), in which everything happens at 
precisely the right moment, in precisely the manner in 
which everything fails to happen in real life Another 
boy who wins his way up from straitened circum- 
stances is the hero of " The Bishop's Shadow " (Revell), 
the bishop being the late Phillips Brooks, of glorious 
and saintly memory. If there is anything which ought 
to make a small boy proud, it is the manner in which 
other small boys wage successful warfare with a tribe 
of red Indians in war-paint, in the pages of Mr. Ed- 
ward S. Ellis's " Iron Heart, Chief of the Iroquois " 
(Coates). It is really worth while. "Three Times 
Three" (Revell) is a composite tale of a boy's tempta- 
tions in a large city, written by many hands, including 
those of Mrs. G. R. Alden, Miss Faye Huntington, and 
others. It is moral. 

Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine's latest book, 

*** "The Beacon Prize Medals, and Other 

'' Stories" (Baker & Taylor Co.), includes 

also the thrilling tale of happily averted accident, " Out 

with the Tide." The short stories of which the volume 

is composed are intended for both boys and girls, and

they make this double appeal successfully. It is a curi- 
ous fact that boys in stories always gain by being asso- 
ciated with other boys' sisters, so far as gentleness and 
kindliness are concerned " The Fugitive " (Scribner) 
of Mr. John R. Spears is an instance of a contrary sort, 
showing all the assorted evils which come to a lad 
deprived of feminine influence. The book is melo- 
dramatic, and not up to the author's own standard 
after the earlier chapters are passed. It has to do 
with slaves and with slave ships. Even more ambi- 
tious, and a book to be read with profit by young and 
old alike, is Mr. Thomas Nelson Page's " Santa Claus's 
Partner" (Scribner), as pretty a bit of adventure in 
domestic circles as can well be written. " The Young 
Master of Hyson Hall " (Lippincott); by Mr. Frank 
R. Stockton, reminds us that Mr. Stockton's first suc- 
cesses were with children's stories. This has less than 
usual of the somewhat characteristic whimsicality of 
the author, and is none the worse on that account. 
Informed with the spirit of poetry, Mrs. Maud Balling- 
ton Booth's " Sleepy Time Stories " (Putnam) are 
models of writing for the young, being wholly free from 
mawkishness, and much to be treasured. " Uncle 
Remus " might have inspired Mr. Joel Chandler Har- 
ris's " Plantation Pageants " (Houghton), and all that 
made his first book world-famous enters into this last 
work of his. It is funny, and it is considerably more, 
by way of good measure. Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks 
weaves the poet Longfellow into his story of a vacation 
summer, " On Wood Cove Island " (Penn Publishing 
Co.), making him the centre of interest to a number of 
little people. In a somewhat similar fashion General 
Grant is woven into "Under the Tamaracks" (Penn), 
also by Mr. Brooks. The story was popular several 
years ago. 

Of books more distinctly for girls, none 
About girls could be more Delightful reading than 
andforthem. 

Miss barah Orne Jewett s "Betty Leices- 
ter's Christmas " (Houghton). It is an international 
work, telling how a simple-hearted little American girl 
made one of the stately homes of England the merrier 
for her presence. " My Lady Frivol " (Lippincott), 
by Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey, is for girls almost 
grown up, and is almost a full-fledged English novel. 
"Under the Cactus Flag" (Houghton), by Mrs. Nora 
Archibald Smith, tells of a young American girl who 
went to teach school in Mexico, and what delightful 
experiences she had in the neighboring republic. Mrs. 
A. D. T. Whitney tells a story which bids fair to equal 
the best of her well and favorably known stories for 
girls, in " Square Pegs " (Houghton). Estabel, the 
heroine, is charming Mrs. Amanda M. Douglas pub- 
lishes two books (Dodd, Mead & Co.), one of them 
telling of " A Little Girl in Old Philadelphia," as a com- 
panion to her former book about a little girl in old 
New York, and the other a sequel to a better-known 
series, " The Heir of Sherburne." Both can be com- 
mended. " Peggy " (Dana Estes) is a school-girl book 
by Miss Laura E. Richards, and is filled with fun and 
frolic; while "Quicksilver Sue" (Century), by the 
same author, has a little of the pathos in it that made 
her " Captain January " so acceptable. Sweet little 
tales, short as sweet, make up the "Little Fig Tree 
Stories" (Houghton) of Mrs. Mary Hallock Foote. 
They make the bewintered Easterner long for the 
glories of the California climate. " Roses " (Ketcham) 
is as English as possible, Miss Amy Le Feuvre telling 
us in it of a little girl adopted by her old godmamma, 



and the happiness that came from this relation That 
thoughtless selfishness which is at the bottom of half 
the world's ill is exposed in its perfect ugliness by Mrs. 
Lucy C. Lillie in " Margaret Thorp's Trial " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). Margaret has a sister to whom she is 
devoted unreasonably at first, but her devotion finally 
brings about a realization of the truth. Mrs. Ellen 
Olney Kirk has a cheerful admixture of sea and shore 
in " Dorothy and Her Friends " (Houghton), a book 
for quite little girls. " A Flower of the Wilderness " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) is a nice little Puritan maiden 
whose portrait is painted with both pen and pencil by 

Miss A. G. Plympton " Elsie in the South " (Dodd, 

Mead & Co.) is the fortieth book from the workshop 
of Mrs. Martha Finley, all very well liked, and all 
flavored with the language of the Sunday school. 
"The Island Impossible" (Little, Brown, & Co.) of 
Miss Harriet Morgan has its whimsies drawn into pic- 
tures by Mrs. Katharine Pyle, and the resulting volume 
is out of the common and laughable. "Harum-Scarum 
Joe " (Dana Estes) is slight and Southern, by Miss 
Will Allen Drumgoole. It is rather a story for little 
girls than boys, though written about a boy. Of colo- 
nial interest, showing something of the history behind 
" Evangeline," is Miss Eliza F. Pollard's " A Daughter 
of France " (Nelson), an account of a little Huguenot 
child in Acadia The rather unusual Australian girl 
makes " Trefoil " (Nelson), by Miss M. P. Macdonald, 
more than ordinarily interesting. There are three of 
her, and they have a society of their own, showing the 
pervasiveness of the club movement. The " Wheat 
and Huckleberries" (Wilde) of Mrs. Charlotte M. 
Yaile is another wholesome book from a competent 
hand, telling of three girls from the West who spend a 
summer in New England. With a little of the fash- 
ionable sociological interest, and a great deal more of 
humanity in it, Miss Carolyn Wells has turned her 
manifest talents to excellent use in "The Story of 
Betty" (Century). It is an account of a little Irish 
maid-of-all-work who adopts a most curious family of 
her own as soon as she can afford it. " We Four Girls " 
(Lee & Shepard) sets forth the adventures of some 
girl friends who spend a summer vacation together in 
the country. The author, Miss Mary G. Darling, shows 
how their divergent characters act and react to the 
advantage of them all. A judicious blending of Italian 
art and American girlhood is the distinguishing feature 
of Miss Deristhe L. Hoyt's " Barbara's Heritage, or 
Young Americans among the Old Italian Masters" 
(Wilde) If an ideal farm is lovely, so is Mrs. C. F. 
Eraser's little book about one, called "Strawberry 
Hill" (Crowell). When "Wee Lucy's Secret" (Lee 
& Shepard) is said to be the fourth volume of " Little 
Prudy's Children " series, everyone knows all about it. 
It is a pleasant thought that Sophie May (Miss Clarke) 
can write as spontaneously for the grandchildren as she 
did long years ago for the grandmothers " Sunbeams 
and Moonbeams " (Crowell) takes its name from two 
clubs, one of girls and one of boys, which Mrs. Louise 
R. Baker brings into contrast, with interesting and 
sometimes laughable results. A happy combination of 
imagination and history makes " The House with Sixty 
Closets" (Lee & Shepard) of Mr. Frank Samuel Child 
justify its sub-title of "A Christmas Story for Young 
Folks and Old Children." The pictures, unfortunately, 
detract from the illusion of the narrative. "Little 
Miss Conceit" (Bradley) is by Miss Elinor D. Adams. 
It is the useful account of a spoiled child's becoming

for on 



unspoiled. Pictures by Miss Bess Goe enhance the 
charm of a rather mature book for girls, Miss Amy E. 
Blanchard's " Miss Vanity " (Lippincott). The story 
is a sweet and wholesome one. " Two Wyoming Girls " 
(Penn Publishing Co.), by Mrs. Carrie L. Marshall, 
tells of life in the far West under discouragements and 
trials which are made right at last by womanly stead- 
fastness and courage " My Lady Barefoot " (Penn 
Publishing Co.), by Mrs. Evelyn Raymond, recounting 
the hardships and final success of a little backwoods 
woman, is really new in its scenery and episodes. Miss 
Annie M. Barnes has a Georgia background for her 
"Ferry Maid of the Chattahoochee " (Penn Publishing 
Co.), in which a little girl succeeds in supporting a fam- 
ily by dint of great cheerfulness and much hard work. 
A combination of history and religion is "A Maid of 
the First Century" (Penn Publishing Co.), by Mrs. 
Lucy Foster Madison, following as it does a little mai- 
den from Palestine to Rome, and her speedy conversion 
to the new faith. 

Books, whether their charm lies in their 
text, their pictures, or both, seem to be- 
come epicene when told for the very young. 
It is this which gives most of them a little-boy-and-girl 
interest, rather than one peculiar to either sex taken 
singly. " Told Under the Cherry Trees " (Lee & Shep- 
ard), gives Miss Grace Le Baron an opportunity to 
bring two orphans, Willie and Miriam, together. Then 
Willie goes off and grows up and gets rich in the most 
conventional manner. Its scene laid in the vicarage of 
a small English village, " Rob and Kit " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.), by the author of " Miss Toosey's Mission," is 
a placid little tale, ending in a break-up and the coming 
of Rob to America. Mr. James Otis, who is as versa- 
tile as he is industrious, makes a very good story, in 
which old acquaintances appear, of " Christmas at 
Deacon Hackett's" (Crowell). It is bright without 
being forced " King Pippin " (Page) is a good little 
boy who is still not too good for his health. It is the 
last addition, by Mrs. Gerard Ford, to the " Gift Book " 
series. Not a little people's book, though there are 
little people in it, is " The Wild Ruthvens " (Page), by 
Mr. Curtis Yorke. They become tamer in the course 
of the narrative. In the " Cosy Corner " series (Page), 
there are three volumes, one, " Two Little Knights of 
Kentucky," by Miss Annie Fellows Johnson, with a large 
bear in it; another, "Little King Da vie," is by Miss 
Nellie Hellis, with a boy in a hospital who is almost too 
self-denying; while the third is " A Little Daughter of. 
Liberty," by Miss Edith Robinson, in which the heroine 
is a little Revolutionary girl whose descendants, let us 
hope, are as zealous for freedom in America as she 
was " A Pair of Pickles " (Bradley) tells of two Eng- 
lish children, one of them a Sir Lionel, and is written 
by Mrs. Evelyn Everett-Green. 

Stories of animals are numerous enough to 
form a category by themselves, and Mr. 
Andrew Lang's "Red Book of Animal 
Stories" (Longmans) surely heads the list with its more 
or less mystical references to " The Wuss, the Azorkon, 
and the Pod." It is a collection of unusual creatures, 
and in its inventor's happiest manner. " Father Goose, 
His Book " (George M. Hill Co.) has its pages filled 
with animals and children by Mr. William Wallace 
Denslow, Mr. L. Frank Baum furnishing the merry 
jingles which accompany them. The book makes a field 
for itself, being quite of its own kind and immensely 
entertaining A Child's Primer of Natural History " 



Indium and 
golliwoggi. 



(Soribner) has its comical drawings and equally comical 
verses from the same hand, that of Mr. Oliver Herford. 
It is the sort of book grown-up people buy to give their 
children so they can read it themselves. Out of the 
ordinary sort is " The Adventures of a Siberian Cub " 
(Page), translated from the Russian by M. Le*on Golsch- 
111:11111, and plentifully supplied with pictures by Miss 
Winifred Austin. It is a pleasant account of a little 

bear who attains his maturity in captivity Miss 

Etheldred B. Barry's pitiful story, Little Tong's Mis- 
sion" (Dana Estes), is as pathetic as a little crippled 
boy can make it. Tong is the boy, but Jeff, his dog, is 
almost as important in the story, and adds greatly to its 
value. The escape from zoological gardens of a parrot, 
and the results, make " Madam Mary of the Zoo " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) one of Mrs. Lily F. Wesselhoeft's 
most successful books for children. It is humorous, 
instructive, and interesting " Bruno" (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) is Mr. Byrd Spillman Dewey's narrative of a 
fine hunting dog, and a most excellent book for boys 
with pets or without them. 

The American Indian comes in for sym- 
pathetic treatment in children's books, 
if nowhere else. "Indian Child Life" 
(Stokes), with many entertaining and truthful pictures 
in both color and black-and-white by Mr. Edwin Willard 
Doming, the reading matter by Mrs. Therese O. Deming, 
is an excellent example of this. " Docas, the Indian 
Boy of Santa Clara " (Heath), by Mrs. Genevra Sisson 
Snedden, is another, being accompanied by more than 
a score of full-page pictures. Of another sort, since 
the Indians are used in caricature as illustrations for a 
parody of " Hiawatha," is "Our Indians, a Midnight 
Visit to the Great Somewhere-or-Other " (Dutton), 
sketches and hand-lettering being done by Mr. L. D. 
Bradley. Other books filled with pictures for small 
children and their kinsfolk are not so numerous as in 
former years. " Outside of Things, A Sky Book " 
(Dutton) has some astronomical verses done by Miss 
Alice Ward Bailey, with more or less appropriate illus- 
trations by Miss Annita Lyman Paine. " The Golli- 
wogg in War" (Longmans) is another of the books by 
the Misses Upton, funny enough for very small chil- 
dren, and indicating that the martial spirit has fairly 
invaded the kindergarten. Of the same sort is "Gal- 
lant Little Patriots " (Stokes), with text by Miss Mabel 
Humphrey and pictures by Miss Maud Humphrey. It 
shows various babes in soldier and sailor uniform, 
potential enlargers of the empire we older ones shall 
leave them Two quaint translations from the Ger- 
man of Wilhelm Busch have been made by Mr. Charles 
T. Brooks, " Plish and Plum " and " Max and Maurice " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.). The pictures are as old-fash- 
ioned and Teutonic as possible, and the heroes of the 
two stories very mischievous indeed. 

Of fairy tales there is no lack. Mr. 
Charles J. Bellamy tells six delightful 
ones in his " Return of the Fairies " (Little 
Folks Publishing Co.), and they have the real feeling 
of wonder and simplicity. " Nannie's Happy Child- 
hood " (Houghton), by Mrs. Caroline Leslie Field, is 
an every-day story, with fairies coming in by way of 
variety, to show how natural it all is after one under- 
stands it. With these are to be classed two re-publica- 
tions, " Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales " and " Old French 
Fairy Tales" (Little, Brown, & Co.), both being selec- 
tions from the tales of Charles Perrault, Madame 
D'Anlnoy, aud many more. They are plentifully illus-

trated. A new " Mother Goose " (Lippincott) has the 
advantage of being interpreted by the pencil of Mr. 
F. Opper, who puts a new and most oddly modern 
aspect on the old rhymes. The book is as funny as a 
book can be, for the pictures exceed two hundred and 

fifty in number A new edition of the late William 

Brighty Rand's " Lilliput Lyrics " (John Lane) owes 
its undoubted fun to the spirited and delicious sketches 
of Mr. Charles Robinson, quite as much as to the 
classical verses they interpret " Alice in Wonder- 
land " loses in one direction and gains in another with 
the substitution of pictures by Blanche McManus (Mrs. 
M. F. Mansfield) for those of Sir John Tenniel. But 
Messrs. Mansfield & Wessels have given it a presenta- 
tion quite worthy of its merits in every respect. 
Equally munificent is a new edition of Hans Christian 
Andersen's " Fairy Tales " (Truslove, Hanson & 
Comba), for which Dr. E. E. Hale has written an intro- 
duction and Miss Helen Stratton drawn more than four 
hundred pictures. To these must be added luxurious 
editions of Charles and Mary Lamb's " Mrs. Leisces- 
ter's School " (Dent), with pictures in color by Miss 
Winifred Green, and their " Tales from Shakespeare " 
(Truslove), with an introduction by Mr. Andrew Lang 
and numerous pictures by Mr. Robert Bell. And 
there is a new edition called " A Hundred Fables of 
JEsop " (John Lane), for which Mr. Kenneth Grahame 
has prepared a charming prefatory statement, the illus- 
trations being by Mr. Percy J. Billinghurst. This follows 
the perfect English of Sir Roger L'Estrange. The 
" Tales of Languedoc " (Macmillan), from the French 
of Samuel Jacques Brun, is done by Mrs. Harriet W. 
Preston, and is all that can be desired in its account, 
fully illustrated, of romance and history in that land of 
song and story. " The Prince's Story Book " (Long- 
mans) is a companion to the " Queen's Story Book " of 
Isat year, and, like it, is edited by Mr. George Laurence 
Gomme. It deals with selections, taken from many 
sources old and new, all of which carry on the account 
of English kings. " The Talking Thrush and Other 
Tales from India" (Dutton) is an excellent collection 
of fairy and folk stories from Hindustan, made by Mr. 
W. Crooke, re-told by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, and beau- 
tifully illustrated by Mr. W. H. Robinson. The tales 
are familiar in Europeanized forms. Of the same sort 
is " Fairy Tales from Far Japan " (Revell), translated 
by Miss Susan Ballard, with an introduction by Mrs. 
Isabella L. Bishop, the illustrations being from the 
hands of native artists. The stories are fascinating. 
"Tales of an Old Chateau" (McClurg) is an agglom- 
eration of French folk-lore stories, gathered by Miss 
Margaret Bouvet, the different bits being pleasantly 
told. Following stories of the Iliad and Odyssey comes 
"The Story of the ^Eneid " (Penn Publishing Co.), by 
Dr. Edward Brooks. Virgil's charm is, of course, un- 
translatable, but the effect here is seemly, as a whole. 

Anthologies, Deserving mention of a particular kind is 
new editions, " The Listening Child " (Macmillan), an 
and annuals. ant hology of verse, narrative and descrip- 
tive, and all the rest, done by Mrs. Lucy W. Thacher, 
with a prefatory note by Colonel T. W. Higginson. 
Nothing we know in English is more likely to give a 
child of impressionable age a downright love for the 
highest form of literary expression than the contents of 
this admirable volume, whether he listens to another's 
reading or reads it for himself. There remain to be 
noted new editions of " Robinson Crusoe " and " Swiss 
Family Robinson" (Crowell); the always welcome 



"Chatterbox" (Dana Estes); the orthodox "Sunday 
Reading for the Young" (E. & J. B. Young); and 
the admirable " St. Nicholas Christmas Book " (Cent- 
ury), with its wealth of pictures, and contributions by 
scores of the best known writers for children. 



jLlTERARY NOTES. 



Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a revised edition of G. A. 
Wentworth's " Solid Geometry." 

A " New Higher Algebra," by Mr. Webster Wells, 
is published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish a neat two- vol- 
ume reissue of the " Poetical Works " of Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti. 

" Csesar and Pompey in Greece," being selections from 
Book III. of the Civil War," edited by Mr. E. H. Ath- 
erton, is published by Messrs Ginn & Co. 

The last five books of the "Iliad," edited by Profes- 
sor Edward B. Clapp, is published by Messrs. Ginn & 
Co. in their " College Series of Greek Authors." 

" The Dawn of a New Era, and Other Essays," by 
Dr. Paul Carus, is the latest issue in " The Religion of 
Science Library," issued by the Open Court Company. 

Mr. Samuel Dill's " Roman Society in the Last Cen- 
tury of the Western Empire " (Macmillan), reviewed by 
us only a few months ago, has already gone into a sec- 
ond and revised edition, which is published at a reduced 
price. 

Mr. Francis P. Harper is the American publisher of 
the sixth edition of " Old English Plate," by Mr. Wil- 
fred Joseph Cripps. This work has for twenty years 
been a standard authority upon its subject, and in its 
present revision becomes more useful than ever. It 
contains over 2,600 facsimiles of plate marks and 123 
illustrations of ancient pieces. 

Professor G. R. Carpenter's " Elements of Rhetoric 
and English Composition " (Macmillan) is the revision 
and expansion of an earlier work having substantially 
the same title, and now withdrawn from circulation. 
It bears the impress of the latest educational thought 
relating to the beginnings of secondary school work, and 
deserves warm commendation. 

Mr. Charles Annesley's " The Standard Operaglass " 
(Brentano's) contains brief synopses of the plots of no 
less than one hundred and twenty-three operas, which 
is many more than the average opera- goer, however as- 
siduous, gets a chance to hear in a whole lifetime. The 
present is the fifteenth edition of this popular work, to 
which Mr. James Huneker contributes an entertaining 
introduction. 

The 1898 volume of the American Art Annual hav- 
ing been published late in the season, it has been found 
advisable to issue only a pamphlet supplement, which 
will be published at once (Macmillan). This will con- 
tain a diary with dates of the principal exhibitions, meet- 
ings of art societies, etc., for the season of 1899-1900, 
a list of important sales of the season of 1898-1899, 
and other matter. 

" A First Manual of Composition " (Macmillan), by 
Dr. E. H. Lewis, is a text-book prepared for that edu- 
cational limbo which includes the upper grammar and 
lower high school grades. This work serves as an in- 
troduction to the " First Book in Writing English " of the 
same author, and also to certain " manuals " upon which 
he is now engaged. The book is thoroughly practical,

and contrives to be interesting to young students, which 
is an object not often attained in texts of this descrip-

The recent vicissitudes in the affairs of Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers of New York, which have caused 
general concern among the friends of that old and hon- 
orable house, have culminated in the formal transfer of 
the business to a trustee, under the conditions of a 
mortgage for a large sum held by Messrs. J. Pierpont 
Morgan & Co., bankers. The trustee has appointed as 
agent Mr. G. B. M. Harvey, proprietor of the " North 
American Review," who has thus become the legal and 
actual manager of the Harper establishment. It is 
stated that this step was taken by mutual agreement, 
and with the full approval of the Messrs. Harper, as 
being the best method of effecting a permanent readjust- 
ment of their affairs. Although the amount of their 
indebtedness is given as over five millions of dollars, 
the assets are believed to materially exceed that sum, 
and with the fresh assistance, financial and administra- 
tive, which the house will receive, there will be no im- 
pairment of its credit or efficiency. The periodicals of 
the house will be continued, with the exception of " The 
Round Table " and " Literature," which will, it is said, 
be discontinued; and the general book publishing busi- 
ness will go on as before. The house of Harper & 
Brothers was founded nearly a century ago, and has 
from the first occupied a commanding and honorable 
position in the American publishing trade; and it is 
greatly to be hoped that the present readjustment will 
mark the beginning of a new period of prosperity and 
usefulness.

The new book is notable, first, because giv-

poseful stories ; and, second, because woven 
into the story are the author's own answers to 
the multitude of questions which have arisen 
in the discussion over his former books, such 
as, " Are these plans feasible ? " " Have they 
been tried ? " " What ought to be done in my 
special case? " etc. Every Sheldon reader will 
therefore wish to read this story. 

" Is not behind the others in interest. Strung upon a 
very attractive little story are a great many practical 
lessons in faith and work and morals. The whole is 
arranged in a way to stimulate piety and good works."

The " Necessary" Magazine 



IN 



THE PRESIDENTIAL YEAR 



Theodore Roosevelt. ''The, REVIEW OF REVIEWS does really 
important work because it gives not merely an epitome of what 
is going on in the world, but a chance to every man of whatever 
political creed, who writes seriously and deeply, to reach the 
classes of our people most interested in the vital government and 
social problems of our time. I know that through its columns 
views have been presented to me that I could not otherwise have 
access to: because all earnest and thoughtful men, no matter 
how widely their ideas diverge, are given free utterance in its 
columns" 



SEVERAL hundred thousands of Americans find the AMERICAN MONTHLY 
REVIEW OF REVIEWS very useful and helpful reading. In the political 
year it becomes fairly necessary. In no presidential year will this be more 
true than in 1900, with the many important problems created by the country's 
new colonial duties. In Dr. Shaw's editorial survey of the month, in the 
timely contributed features, in the departments reviewing the other maga- 
zines of the world, the alert reader finds each month a full and accurate 
presentation of the political news, with able discussions of the economic 
and social questions which are interesting everybody. The authoritative 
character sketches of the presidential candidates and other notable figures 
appear at the hour when public interest is greatest in these subjects. The 
portrayal of current history in the best caricatures of each month is not the 
least attractive of these many helps to a right understanding of one's own 
times, and one's own public duties. 

Each number is illustrated with nearly a hundred timely pictures.

For the purpose of showing what effect prices have on sales, we are putting on the 

market an edition of 

Von Hoist's Constitutional and Political History 

of the United States 

AT LESS THAN ONE-HALF THE REGULAR PRICE. 
Best English cloth, gilt tops, large type, good paper, complete in eight volumes, 

PRICE, $12.00 NET. 

THE History has been written with a broad understand ing of the influences that contributed 
to form the constitution, and have governed the political thought and growth of the coun- 
try. Political movements are traced to their origins with great care and acuteness, and no fact 
is relied upon until it is fully established. An impartial and generous spirit pervades the work. 
It is written without prejudice or foregone conclusions. This principle it is which gives the 
author freedom, and the fearlessness that has provoked in some quarters resistance to some 
scathing judgments, together with replies of varying character. But these criticisms and 
replies have but aided the sure growth of the history in favor with the scholar and the public. 
The day has gone by when the best American citizen demands limitless, reasonless praise of 
his institutions, and the time has come when he and they rely on and invite candid, judicial, 
plain statements, neither extenuating nor suppressing the truth. The time has come for such 
a history as Dr. von Hoist's, and the value of the work is understood and keenly appreciated 
by all who have met it. A rare association of qualities has enabled Dr. von Hoist to investigate 
tirelessly, judge dispassionately and with great soberness of mind, and relate the story of our 
constitutional and political career with a clearness and vigor that separate his history entirely 
from the usual more or less prejudiced and perhaps dry studies of constitutional topics. The 
enthusiasm and conviction of the historian at once captivate the reader, and few, after beginning 
the history, will leave it without completing it. 

As a gallery of American statesmen, von Hoist's history probably has no equal. Hamil- 
ton, Jefferson, Adams, Houston, Troup, Benton, Van Buren, Harrison, Brigham Young, Cal- 
houn, Seward, John Brown, Lincoln to specify these is but to suggest the long list of names 
that in this history are men. 

The first volume of the history was, in a sense, eyed askance by the American public, who 
had come to look on foreign views of America as either bald praise or bald abuse, and were 
unprepared for a work of the most difficult sort, showing painstaking research and preparation, 
candor, keenness, comprehension of the American spirit and, above all, a frankness and fair- 
ness of treatment that made the history its own standard, and set the standard for future 
studies, complete or fragmentary, of United States history. 



'A masterpiece as to depth, clearness, impartiality, and scope. 
In these passing years, when teachers and writers are attempting to 
kindle new flames of patriotism in old and young hearts, this pro- 
duction is timely indeed." DAVID SWING. 

44 A work which every student must needs possess in its entirety."

SCRIBNER'S HOLIDAY BOOKS 



" The work of the greatest literary interest of the year" 

THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON 

Edited by SIDNEY COLVIN. 

Illustrated by Guerin and Pei^otto. 2 vols., 8vo, $5.00 net. 
" r I^HE letters to Mr. Colvin or Mr. Henley about his own writings, the point of view he 

1 reveals when he tells Henry James or J. M. Barrie about their productions, the judg- 
ments he passes on Zola (whom he can barely endure) and Paul Bourget (in whom, at least 
in as far as the ' Sensations d'ltalie ' are concerned, he delights), all this throws light, as the 
saying goes, upon the genesis and evolution of his own books. But, we repeat, it is the man, 
not the author, that counts in these pages. The author is insistent enough to make such 
letters as we have cited above, with their vivid illustrations of his professional attitude, 
intensely significant, indispensable to the filling out of the writer's portrait. But the great 
thing is ' the sum of virtues ' in himself, the great thing is the sweetness and force of char- 
acter which, as embalmed in these letters, would keep Stevenson's name alive if every one 
of his studies in the art of fiction were forgotten." New York Tribune. 

" It is a book that no lover of Stevenson, and in fact no lover of good literature, can 
afford to be without." New York Times.

M O attempt is made in this book to resurrect or reconstruct buried Paris. Only those remains of the old 
' city which still stand, concealed and unknown often, are brought before the reader; and as he sees these 
he learns memories, associations, and meaning. So, even to those who know the Paris of to-day, there is shown 
the wondrously rich old Paris which is yet so new to many persons the Paris of Moliere and La Fontaine, 
of Corneille and Racine, of Balzac and Hugo. 

BRITISH CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS

IVAR. COSMO MONKHOUSE'S book consists of chapters of the highest critical and descriptive value on

the best known, most highly esteemed, and best equipped of English art critics.

interiors, etc. 

PETER PAUL RUBENS 

His Life and his Work. By EMILE MICHEL. With 29 colored plates, 40 photogravures, and over 

200 text cuts. 2 vols., royal 8vo, $15.00 net. 

A N elaborately illustrated biography of the great Flemish painter. Emile Michel is well known as the author 
** of a " Life of Rembrandt" which has taken first place among the biographies of Rembrandt, and it is safe 
to say that his new work, containing, as it does, much newly discovered material relative to the life and work 
of Rubens, will become the authoritative biography of that artist. The illustrative material is unusually varied 
and rich.

'THIS charming volume of Mr. Cable's is published in uniform style with the edition of " Old Creole Days,"

A CHARMING vein of humor and philosophy runs through Mr. Lanier's affectionately intimate story of his 
** pet mocking bird Bob, giving the book a literary quality of an altogether unusual kind and setting it in a 
niche of its own. The illustrations have been reproduced in colors from carefully made and painted photo- 
graphs, and are as artistic as they are in perfect harmony with the author's delightful narrative, passages of 
which they illustrate.

|\y\R. FINCK'S new work, the fruit of thirteen years of research among original authorities, is destined to 
* v * create a new epoch in the sociology of love and marriage and to attract the widest attention among students 
of the evolution of marriage. The fulness and frankness of the discussion, which is fortified by an extra- 
ordinarily large and varied collection of love-stories of primitive races, make the book also of the greatest 
popular interest.

"The Leading 



$3.00 A YEAR. 

THE December number opens the One Hundredth volume of HARPER'S 
MAGAZINE. This number is in itself & guarantee of the progressive move- 
ment of the MAGAZINE and of its outlook for the future. During the coming 
year, enhanced in every essential quality, yet at a lowered price, HARPER'S 
MAGAZINE will enter upon a new era of expansion and development. 

Following in the Royal procession of great novelists whose 
more notable works have appeared in the serial fiction 
of the MAGAZINE the publishers announce for 1900: 

Two Great Serials by Two Great Writers. 



THE MANTLE OF ELIJAH. 

A Novel. By I. ZANGWILL, author of " Chil- 
dren of the Ghetto," etc. 
An important feature of this dramatic serial is the 
domestic side of the hero's character. The author deals 
in his masterly way with some of the vital questions of 
our time. The dramatic strength of the novel is indi- 
cated by the fact that it is to form the basis of a play 
for immediate production on the stage after its con- 
clusion in the MAGAZINE. It will be profusely 
illustrated by Louis Loeb. 



ELEANOR. 

A Novel. By Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, au- 
thor of " Robert Elsmere," " Marcella," 
etc. 

The theme of this story is based on the deep cur- 
rents swaying the religious and political thought of 
Christendom in this generation. The romance is one 
of passion and of human faith, and, in both, is a mas- 
terful portrayal of the never-ending conflict between 
the old and the new. The pictures are from studies 
made in Italy by Albert Sterner. 



DEVIL TALES. 



HUMOROUS STORIES. By W. W. JACOBS, author of Many Cargoes "; SEUMAS 
M \ M A M s. author of " Through the Turf Smoke "; MARK TWAIN, and others. 

No writer surpasses Mrs. VIRGINIA FRAZER BOYLE in her artistic 
and sympathetic adaptations of the actual negro superstitions. Each 
tale will be profusely illustrated by A. B. Frost. 

INDIAN TALES. Written and illustrated by Miss ANGEL DE CORA. These naive 
tales of the North American Indian assume inherent value and importance from the fact that 
the author is herself a native Indian girl. 

Under this title Mr. FRANK R. STOCKTON has written a lively A BICYCLE 
romance in his best vein, full of amusing incidents and surprises. QF CATHAY. 

Rudyard Kipling in A WINTER'S NOTE- BOOK 

Has gathered together some of his observations of winter in Vermont, which, with many 
accompanying illustrations of peculiar but general interest and original value, will form one 
of the most attractive articles in an early number of the magazine. 

Another important feature will be a two-part novelette by GILBERT PARKER, the scene of 
which is laid in the channel islands. 

Among other writers of short stories whose work will appear in early issues are : 
CAPTAIN CAIRNES, OWEN WISTER, STEPHEN CRANE, 

DR. C. W. DOYLE, FREDERIC REMINGTON, MARIE VAN VORST.

ominous too much that commonly is the last and best

A QUESTION OF ETHICS. 

A passage in Mr. Lecky's recent work, 
"The Map of Life," has caused some little stir 
in ecclesiastical circles. The great historian 
of morals takes occasion to speak of a biog- 
raphy of the late John Boyle O'Reilly, and of 
a eulogistic preface written for the book by no 
less distinguished a personage than Cardinal 
Gibbons. This action of the eminent church- 
man is somewhat harshly characterized as be- 
ing a condonation of the crime committed in 
early manhood, which led to O'Reilly's convic- 
tion and transportation to a penal colony. In 
reply to this criticism, the Cardinal contributes 
to the London " Tablet " the following state- 
ment: 

"Assuming I was acquainted with the facts, Mr. 
Lecky complained that I have not uttered a single word 
in condemnation of O'Reilly's violation of his oath. I 
feel it due to myself and in the interests of truth to 
declare that till I read Mr. Lecky's criticism I did not 
know O'Reilly had ever been a Fenian or a British 
soldier, or had tried to seduce other soldiers from their 
allegiance. In fact, up to this moment I have never 
read a line of the biography for which I wrote an intro- 
duction, and I hope that the author of the life, if he 
comes across this letter, will not regard me as discour- 
teous to him for making this avowal." 

This statement is so remarkable that it de- 
serves more than passing attention, for it in- 
volves a question of the utmost importance to 
the ethics of literature. 

In the first place, and by way of preface, we 
wish to say that few men in the public life of 
America are deserving of the respect and ad- 
miration which are the just due of Cardinal 
Gibbons. Not only as a leader of his own 
church, but also as a leader in that wider 
sphere which embraces all the activities that 
go to the making of good citizenship and the 
promotion of social health, the distinguished 
prelate of Baltimore has deserved well of his 
fellow-countrymen. Nor would we willingly 
speak harshly of O'Reilly, who, as an adopted 
citizen of the United States, lived a blameless 
life, and won an enthusiastic following among 
the better elements of our society. But, hav- 
ing made all these reservations, the bare facts 
remain that (1) O'Reilly was once guilty of 
an act for which no defense is possible, (2) 
that his friendly biographers have glossed over 
this act if they have not suppressed mention 



480

[Dec. 16, 



of it altogether, and (3) that his ecclesiastical 
eulogist wrote the preface in question, upon 
his own admission, without knowledge of so 
essential an episode, and even without reading 
" a line of the biography " for which he thus 
became a sponsor. 

It is evident that the plea made by Cardinal 
Gibbons in reply to Mr. Lecky's criticism of- 
fers no real defense of the act concerned, and 
leaves him, if anything, in worse case than be- 
fore. The matter is very simple. A man 
whose calling is such that he is bound by it to 
lay special stress upon ethical considerations 
writes in eulogistic strain of a character upon 
which a dark blot has been fixed, and does not 
take reasonable pains to find out whether that 
character is deserving of unqualified praise. 
Added to this first count there is the second, 
that a man whose position gives unusual au- 
thority to his utterances is found willing to 
recommend to the public, by implication at 
least, a book which he confesses that he has 
never read. The first of these counts calls for 
no particular comment. The evidence is plain, 
and there can be but one judgment upon the 
duty involved and the admitted fact of its 
neglect. Upon the second count there may 
be some variety of opinion, for it opens a 
question which has many ramifications, and 
which comes peculiarly within the province 
of a journal devoted to the interests of liter- 
ature. 

The practice of "introducing" books and 
their authors to the public begins before the 
act of publication. Some obscure writer pre- 
pares a manuscript for the press, and casts 
about for a publisher. He is apt to entertain 
the delusion that his chances of a favorable 
hearing will be enhanced if he goes upon his 
quest armed with testimonials of some sort. 
With this idea in mind, he seeks out some re- 
putable person whose name is widely known 
more frequently a clergyman than anyone else 
plays at once upon the vanity and the good 
nature of his victim, and secures one of those 
vague and kindly letters with which editors 
and publishers are so familiar, and the sight 
of which makes them so weary. Having ob- 
tained these credentials, he submits his manu- 
script and awaits results. These depend, of 
course, almost solely upon the merits of what 
he has to offer, and not, as he fondly supposes, 
upon the good-will of the sponsor whom he 
has chosen for his work. Already we have in 
this practice the first appearance of the insin- 
cere professional " introducer," for with some 



men the function is made almost a profession 
by frequency of performance. 

Up to this point, no particular harm is done, 
for editors and publishers are wary people, who 
have a cold-blooded way of remaining uninflu- 
enced by the warmest of " introductions." It 
is only in the case of actual entry into print 
that the public becomes concerned with the 
plot, and the function of the " introducer " 
takes on a questionable ethical aspect. Here 
the publisher, no less than the writer, is im- 
plicated in a sort of confidence game, and the 
victim is now the unsophisticated general reader, 
who is not upon his guard as the publisher is 
in the initial stages, and with whom the aegis 
of a respected name really serves as a protec- 
tion and a commendation for some work that is 
as likely as not to be intrinsically worthless. 
Sometimes the imposition takes the shape of a 
prefatory chapter of commendation or eulogy, 
sometimes it assumes the more insidious 
form of a dedication, " by personal permis- 
sion and with the greatest respect," to the 
eminent person selected, sometimes it is prac- 
ticed by the naive insertion of extracts from 
solicited testimonials, but in all cases there 
is the same attempt to create a favorable pre- 
possession by an adventitious appeal to some 
achieved reputation. 

The harm in all these devices is that the ap- 
proval given or implied is frequently lacking 
in sincerity. So flagrant an example of the 
abuse as that which furnishes the text for our 
present discussion is not common enough to be 
typical, but it shows to what an extreme the 
abuse may possibly be carried. We are will- 
ing to credit the "introducer," as a rule, with 
some knowledge of the subject and some ex- 
amination of the book to which he lends his 
name, but even iu the majority of cases the 
task seems to be performed in a rather per- 
functory manner. And how the name of the 
victim is exploited! He may have contributed 
no more than a page or two of platitudinous 
generalization, but his name looms large upon 
the title-pages, and is boldly flaunted in the 
advertisements. And there are, unfortunately, 
too many men of reputable rank who are found 
willing, whether out of mere kindliness or in 
return for a payment of money, to allow their 
names to be so used as to product- a mislead- 
ing impression concerning the publications with 
which they are connected. The instance of 
William Cullen Bryant is a conspicuous one 
that will occur to the memory of older readers. 
In the case of large collective enterprises, such

THE DIAL

as a dictionary, an encyclopaedia, or a " library 
of literature," the practice is growing more and 
more common to place some familiar name or 
collection of names in the forefront of the work 
in question, although these names represent 
little or none of the actual responsibility for 
its character. It is refreshing to read Mr. 
Andrew Lang's recent protest against this use 
of his name in connection with a recent Ameri- 
can enterprise. He says, substantially, that 
he was engaged to make a few extracts from 
Scott for a "library" of selections from stand- 
ard literature, and that, to his surprise, his 
name is being widely and flamboyantly adver- 
tised as one of the editors of the work. 

Even the grosser supercheries litteraires, 
which Dumas practiced with so magnificent an 
audacity, are not unknown in our own time, and 
represent but one step beyond the practices to 
which we have hitherto referred. It is an open 
secret among those having practical acquaint- 
ance with literary affairs that men who cannot 
write at all sometimes achieve reputations as 
brilliant essayists. The desire to assemble 
notorieties in a table of contents has led more 
than one magazine editor to connive at the de- 
ception whereby some public man signs his 
name to a paper prepared for him by his lit- 
erary mercenary or his private secretary. The 
ambitions of politicians and actors and mem- 
bers of the professions to shine also in the 
sphere of literature has led to many an act of 
this sort, and will continue so to lead as long 
as the hirer and the hired are willing to make 
terms with each other, and the editor is willing 
to abet the deception. It is evident that the 
practices to which our remarks have been de- 
voted range all the way down the graduated 
scale that begins with what is barely question- 
able and ends with downright dishonesty. It 
is clearly unsafe to enter upon this path at all, 
lest one be tempted to step lower than was at 
first anticipated. The literary conscience 
should be at least as exacting as the commer- 
cial conscience, and those who derogate from 
the highest possible standard in 'these matters 
are sinning against a greater light than is set 
for the feet of men whose life is essentially one 
of action rather than of thought. 



"THE Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John 
Keats," with a prefatory memoir by Mr. Horace E. 
Scudder, form a welcome addition to the " Cambridge " 
poets of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflm & Co. We are 
particularly glad to have the letters as here given in 
chronological arrangement and the edition as a whole 
is of the most satisfactory sort. 



COMMUNICA TIONS, 



ARNOLD AS AN ABIDING FORCE. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAI,. ) 

May I say through your columns with what pleasure 
and sympathy I read Mr. Johnson's thoughtful plea for 
the permanent value of Arnold's writings, in your issue 
of November 16? Mr. Johnson quotes for condemna- 
tion* and dissent from my "Social Ideals in English 
Letters " the phrase, " Already we look back to Ar- 
nold's strong and vivid work as belonging rather to his- 
tory than to the things that are." Taken alone, the 
phrase is, to be sure, sweeping enough, a clumsy and 
inadequate expression of what was in my mind; but the 
whole trend of my treatment of Arnold was to bring 
into evidence, what it seems to me has been too much 
ignored, the remarkable breadth and solidity of his 
social criticism, its clearness of insight, and the curious 
prophetic quality it possesses. The " succes de scan- 
dale " of Arnold's theological work threw his social 
writings for a time into the shade; but they have as- 
suredly an abiding interest and suggestiveness, and they 
are as fresh to many of us to-day as when they were 
written. 

At the same time, quite apart from anyone's desire 
to " better social conditions," a desire which assuredly 
should not affect literary judgments, is it not true as 
a matter of fact that the mood of men has changed 
since Arnold's day? Our estimate of the relative value 
of various truths is simply a question of emphasis. 
Surely, I did not in my book depreciate the permanent 
worth or the genius of Arnold's predecessors, Carlyle 
and Ruskin. I do not know whether they are among 
the immortals; I don't know whether Arnold is. No- 
body knows yet, or will know for at least several gen- 
erations. But while criticism refrains from judgment, 
heart and imagination, I am not ashamed to say, still 
owe allegiance to Carlyle and Ruskin, still owe allegi- 
ance to Arnold. And yet, no one can say that our em- 
phasis to-day falls just where Carlyle placed it. I 
refrain from characterizing Carlyle's attitude, lest some 
wounded disciple rise against me in anger and sorrow; 
but it is obvious that we can no longer look at life from 
precisely his point of view. Just so with Arnold. Aside 
from all personal sympathies, is it not evident that after 
1880 there arose a generation of men of letters, quite 
remote from the often hysterical, usually Utopian, im- 
pulses of the men of '48, yet on the other hand inclined 
to emphasize the value of audacity rather than caution 
in social experiment ? Profiting in a measure by the 
soberer ideas of social methods fostered in the long re- 
action, they yet felt that irresolution is as grave an in- 
tellectual danger as rash and precipitate action, and 
that exclusive harping on the dangers of rash action is 
likely to produce a kind of academic cowardice. They 
did not deny the force or importance of Arnold's teach- 
ing: they simply shifted the emphasis. Perhaps he 
might have been with them had he been a man of their 
day. These men were and are our own contemporaries; 
the Fabians were of them; and I have been surprised, 
in reading Mackail's Life of William Morris, to find 
much more serious thought and significant conviction 
than I had supposed, existing behind his aesthetic and 
emotional revolt. 

It is not easy to trace these subtle changes of em- 
phasis and of mood from generation to generation; per- 
haps it is not worth while. They may prove quite un-

important in the great drama of the race. On the other 
baud, they may prove to have more significance than 
we know, and the society of the future may be glad that 
some obscure people tried, however stupidly, to follow 
them. We should be grateful to-day for sixteenth cen- 
tury interpretations of the phases of experience that 
preceded the Reformation; we treasure all records of 
the shifting convictions which led up to the French 
Revolution. As to Arnold, Mr. Johnson leans perhaps 
a little to the " personal " estimate of his work, 1 to the 
"historic"; what the "real" estimate will be cannot 
yet be said. Opinions may differ as to whether his em- 
phasis is that most distinctively and imperatively needed 
by the world just now; but that the method and atti- 
tude be inculcates bold permanent and vital value, I 
should be the last to deny. All authors, even the small- 
est, live their life with their contemporaries, affecting 
them for good or ill; the time comes when they may 
be said to die as authors as they have died as men. But 
those who have in them something of the immortal rise 
again; that which is permanent in their achievement is 
now set free, to act no longer with the peculiar mag- 
netism possessed probably by the contemporary alone, 
but with the higher efficiency of a spiritual force, se- 
renely interacting with the other forces which proceed 
from the spirits of the ever-wise from the birth of time. 
The contemporary power of Arnold is rapidly passing 
away; but already, for some of us, he is uplifted among 
the illuminating stars.

MR. SARTAIN AND FOE. 

(To the Editor of Tax DIAL. ) 

I have no desire to take part in the controversy over 
Poe, but I feel that a word of comment upon your re- 
view (Nov. 16) of Mr. Sartain's " Recollections of a 
Very Old Man " is needed. The reviewer seems to be 
under the impression that the book contains new testi- 
mony in regard to the last hours of Poe which contra- 
dicts statements made by Professor Woodberry. There 
is nothing new in the matter quoted at length by your 
reviewer. Mr. Sartain has only reproduced, for the 
most part word for word (though he refrains from the 
use of quotation marks), what Dr. Moran published in 
his Defense of Poe in 1885. The statements in this 
Defense are at variance with Professor Woodberry 's 
statements, but they are also at variance with a letter 
written by Dr. Moran himself in 1849. Professor 
Woodberry was aware of Dr. Moran's later version, but 
naturally regarded the evidence of the letter of 1849, 
which he reprints, as the more trustworthy. See Wood- 
berry's " Life of Poe," American Men of Letters, p. 343; 
Dr. J. J. Moran's "Defense of Edgar Allan Poe,"

[Sorely the repeated use of Dr. Moran's name by 
Mr. SarUin shows the fact to be as Professor New- 
coiner states it. Mr. Sartain's use of Dr. Moran's 
material was cited, not as new matter, but as matter 
which seemed quite true to so intimate a friend of 
Foe's as Mr. Sartain shows himself to have been. 
Certainly Mr. Sartain's acceptance of it lends it an 
authority it lacked before EDB. THE DIAL. |

MILLAIS AND THE PRE-RAPHAELITES.* 

Mr. John Guille Millais' life of his father 
is an exceptionally rich and delightful book 
a book likely, we should think, to provoke de- 
nial and perhaps rather heated protest from 
certain quarters in so far as it strays into the 
region of art politics, but one whose narrative 
charm and importance as a contribution to the 
literature of modern art cannot be denied. 
With the salutary movement which, about the 
middle of the century, began to affect the Brit- 
ish school of painting and ended by placing it 
anew in the path of progress, the name of Mil- 
lais must ever be intimately and honorably 
associated ; although his critics have, not with- 
out a certain show or color of truth, charged 
him with a measure of apostasy from the stand- 
ard under which he battled in his militant and 
reforming days. A word about this movement 
and Millais' share in it may be in order here. 

When the century began, the influence of a 
great group of masters headed by Reynolds 
and Gainsborough was still potent for good 
in British painting, and men like Laurence, 
Hoppner, and Morland were carrying on the 
teaching and exemplifying the methods of these 
earlier chiefs of the national school. During 
the first decade, Constable, Crome, Cox, Wil- 
kie, and Ktty appeared to prove by their 
achievements the vitality of British art and the 
success that might attend the efforts of those 
workers who rightly grasped the aims and fol- 
lowed the methods of their great predecessors 
who, be it understood, while seeking in the 
schools all that the schools could give them, 
while reverencing the precepts and diligently 
studying the works of the masters, still never 
forgot to turn, as those masters themselves had 
turned, to Nature as the source and wellspring 
of all high and vital artistic achievement. But 
by the middle of the century a blighting change 
came over the spirit of British painting. Ped- 
antry and convention reigned ; and a style, a 
bastard and so-called Grand Style, founded 
not upon the study of Nature, but upon ab- 
stractions, and therefore declared to be essen- 
tially and nobly intellectual and imaginative 
and free from the taint of gross and trivial

material things, swayed the schools and the 
critics. A strange degeneracy in the works of 
the English artists followed. Forbidden to look 
upon the face of Nature as an unclean thing, 
they sunk into the slough of convention. 

To save the national art from extinction, 
drastic measures were necessary, and the stand- 
ard of revolt must be raised against the sacro- 
sanct doctrines about intellectual art, and the 
current blind worship of a pompous style, and 
vague and bombastic abstractions. With the 
crying necessity of the time, and when matters 
were at their worst, a group of young painters 
suddenly and dramatically rebelled against the 
solemn pedantries of their elders, and asserted 
with the courage of youth their disbelief in the 
creed of the day, and their determination to 
revert to a type of art based upon the closest 
study and imitation of nature, and hence con- 
taining the germs of great achievement. They 
decided that the principles which guided the 
earlier masters, and the observations which lay 
at the root of all great work, were being delib- 
erately decried by modern men, whose borrowed 
methods were bred of conventions set up by a 
long line of degenerate successors of Raphael. 
Thus came into existence that revolutionary 
little band of associates, the Pre-Raphaelite 
Brotherhood, who so profoundly influenced the 
history of the British School. Of the origin 
of the famous " P. R. B.," Mr. Holman Hunt 
favored Mr. Millais with the following account: 
It was in the beginning of the year 1848 that your 
father and I determined to adopt a style of absolute 
independence as to art-dogma and convention. This 
we called 'Pre-Raphaelitism.' D. G. llossetti was al- 
ready my pupil, and it seemed certain that he also, in 
time, would work on the same principles. He had de- 
clared his intention of doing so, and there was begin- 
ning to be some talk of other artists joining us, although 
in fact some were only in the most primitive stages of 
art, such as William Rossetti, who was not even a stu- 
dent. Meanwhile, D. G. Rossetti, himself a beginner, 
had not got over the habit (acquired from Madox 
Brown) of calling our art 'Early Christian'; so one 
day, in my studio, some time after our first meeting, I 
protested, saying that the term would confuse us with 
the German Quattro Centists. I went on to convince 
him that our real name was Pre-Raphaelites,' a name 
which we had already so far revealed in frequent argu- 
ment that we had been taunted as holding opinions 
abominable enough to deserve burning at the stake. 
He thereupon, with a pet scheme of an extended cooper- 
ation still in mind, amended my previous suggestion 
by adding to our title of ' Pre-Raphaelite ' the word 
' Brotherhood.' " 

Rossetti has always been popularly regarded 
as the leading light of Pre-Raphaelitism and 
the chief exponent of its creed and methods. 
This view involves a misconception of the move- 



ment, as may be gathered from Millais' reply 
to his son's question as to the extent of Ros- 
setti 's influence upon the style and character of 
his work. That he resented the supposition 
that such influence had been exerted, is plain. 
" I doubt very much whether any man ever gets the 
credit of being quite square and above board about his 
life and work. The public are like sheep. They fol- 
low each other in admiring what they don't understand 
(Omne ignotum pro magnifico), and rarely take a man at 
what he is worth. If you affect a mysterious air, and 
are clever enough to conceal your ignorance, you stand 
a fair chance of being taken for a wiser man than you 
are; but if you talk frankly and freely of yourself and 
your work, as you know I do, the odds are that any 
silly rumor you may fail to contradict will be accepted 
as true. That is just what has happened to me. The 
papers are good enough to speak of me as a typical 
English artist; but because in my early days I saw a 
good deal of Rossetti the mysterious and un-English 
Rossetti they assume that my Pre-Raphaelite im- 
pulses in pursuit of light and truth were due to him. 
All nonsense! My pictures would have been exactly 
the same if I had never seen or heard of Rossetti. I 
liked him very much when we first met, believing him 
to be (as perhaps he was) sincere in his desire to further 
our aims Hunt's and mine but I always liked his 
brother William much better. D. G. Rossetti, you must 
understand, was a queer fellow, and impossible as a 
boon companion so dogmatic and so irritable when 
opposed. His aims and ideals in art were also widely 
different from ours, and it was not long before he 
drifted away from us to follow his own peculiar fancies. 
What they were may be seen from his subsequent works. 
They were highly imaginative and original and not 
without elements of beauty, but they were not nature. 
At last, when he presented for our admiration the 
young women which have since become the type of Ilos- 
settianism, the public opened their eyes in amazement. 
'And this,' they said, 'is Pre-Raphaelitism!' It was 
nothing of the sort. The Pre-Raphaelites had but one 
idea to present on canvas what they saw in nature ; 
and such productions were absolutely foreign to the 
spirit of their work." 

At first, the significance of the Pre-Raphael- 
ite movement was lost upon the general public? 
and Millais' painting of " Lorenzo and Isa- 
bella," exhibited at the Academy in 1849? 
failed to provoke the onslaught of the critics? 
although it asserted plainly enough his adher- 
ence to the new art heresy. In the following 
year the short-lived " Germ " was issued ; and 
when, in the spring of 1850, the next batch of 
Pre-Raphaelite productions was exhibited the 
storm burst. Its fury was chiefly directed 
against Millais as the ablest and therefore the 
most dangerous of the group of innovators. 
His chief pictures, "Ferdinand Lured by 
Ariel " and " Christ in the House of His 
Parents," were attacked with a bitterness and 
an unscrupulous disregard of their obvious tech- 
nical merits that plainly indicated the alarm of 
the supporters and beneficiaries of the old sys-

[Dec. 16, 



tern. But the attack of 1850 was mild com- 
pared with the frenzy of the following year, 
when it was found that the Brotherhood, so 
far from bending to the storm of abuse, were 
quite ready to go to even greater lengths than 
before in the pictorial avowal of their revolt 
against the established order. Millais was 
defiantly to the fore with his " Return of the 
Dove to the Ark " and " Mariana in the 
Moated Grange " ; and it was he, again, as 
the heresiarch and preraphaelite enrage, who 
bore the brunt of the assault. The chief wea- 
pon used against him was misrepresentation. 
According to one type of the arguments em- 
ployed, " Pre-Raffleism " was " a dodge," a 
bid for notoriety, and Millais had thrown him- 
self into the movement merely to get himself 
advertised and to win the sort of distinction 
that attaches to eccentricity. Other writers 
gravely hinted that his art was sinister and 
reactionary in aim, and savored of black Jesu- 
itry and the wiles of Rome. " Christ in the 
House of His Parents," in fine, was " an 
avowal of medieval superstition, a piece of 
Romanist propagandism designed to pervert 
the morals and upset the religious convictions 
of the community." This time, however, the 
cry of " No Popery " was so obviously and 
ludicrously a false alarm that the British pub- 
lic turned a deaf ear to it. Undoubtedly the 
unsparing and perhaps deliberately over- 
strained realism of the " Christ in the House 
of His Parents " did shock a great many peo- 
ple, and was regarded by them as a species of 
pictorial blasphemy. This view was fairly ex- 
pressed by the writer in the " Literary Gazette," 
who flatly denounced the picture as " a name- 
less atrocity supposed to represent a verae of 
Zecharia." He went on to say : 

" A miserable carpenter's shop with two children em- 
bracing in front of the bench, and a naked distorted 
boy on the right side, are presented to us as high art, 
in which there is neither taste, drawing, expression, or 
genius. And yet this style pertains to an imitative 
school, which, the sooner it is sent back to the dry ness 
and wretched matter-of-fact of old times will be the 
better. Such things are simply disagreeable, if not 
worse, and neither can be called the true end of the 
fine arts." 

Another critic of this positivistic and matter- 
of-fact conception of the Holy Family kindly 
wound up his tirade of contumely by observing 
" We have great difficulty in believing a report 
that this unpleasing and atrociously affected 
picture has found a purchaser at a high price"; 
and he then went on to pay his respects to the 
*' Ferdinand Lured by Ariel," as follows : 



' Another specimen from the same brush inspires 
laughter rather than disgust. A Ferdinand of most 
ignoble physiognomy* is being lured by a pea-green 
monster, intended for Ariel, whilst a row of sprites, such 
as it takes a Millais to devise, watch the operation with 
turquoise eyes. It would occupy more room than the 
thing is worth to expose all the absurdity and imperti- 
nence of this work." 

These sufficiently venomous assailants of the 
little band of revolutionaries seem to have taken 
their cue from the " Times," which hounded 
them on, and demanded that " no quarter " be 
given to Millais and his friends. Referring to 
Millais' Mariana," it proceeded to say : 

41 These young artists have unfortunately become no- 
torious by addicting themselves to an antiquated style 
and an affected simplicity in painting. . . . We can 
extend no toleration to a mere senile imitation of the 
cramped style, false perspective, and crude color of 
remote antiquity. We do not want to see what Fuseli 
termed drapery 'snapped instead of folded,' faces 
bloated into apoplexy, or attenuated skeletons; color 
borrowed from the jars in a druggist's shop, and ex- 
pression forced into caricature." 

It was the above criticism in the Times that 
drew into the arena the doughty champion of 
the Brotherhood, whose powerful onset, skill 
of fence, and mastery of his theme, presently 
turned the tide of battle, gave pause to the 
flood of mere unthinking abuse, and gradually 
awoke the general public to the fact that in the 
decried and derided Pre-Raphaelitism lay the 
germ of great achievement and of the revival 
of the national art Mr. Ruskin. The battle 
was not won at once ; but the tone of even ad- 
verse criticism gradually changed, new adher- 
ents gathered to the support of the once de- 
spised cause, and the truth that underlay the 
doctrines and shone through the sometimes 
eccentric and affected performances of the 
young painters prevailed in the end. As the 
smoke of strenuous battle slowly cleared away, 
and it became clear that the despotic rule of 
academic pedantry and convention was broken, 
a change came over the style and methods of 
Millais. For ten years, about the period of 
militant Pre-Raphaelitism, he adhered in his 
work to the letter of the creed. But as the 
necessity for the defiant and literal assertion 
in his canvasses of the principles of the sect 
passed away, and with it the combative mood 
of the zealous and persecuted propagandist, he 
began to abandon the rigid and elaborate nat- 
uralism, or literalism, of his earlier efforts, 
and to drift toward the breadth, the sug- 
gestiveness, the riotous freedom of touch and

treatment that mark and ennoble his later and 
more characteristic works. There was no 
swerving in his devotion to truth and nature, 
but the transition in the mode of expression, 
though gradual, is pronounced. It is a far 
cry indeed from, say, " Sir Isumbras at the 
Ford," that quaint and elaborate piece of as- 
sertive Pre-Raphaelitism, to such canvasses as 
the " Souvenir of Valasquez." Millais was a 
practical man, a thoroughly modern man in 
his pursuits and way of thinking. He craved 
success, substantial and tangible success, and 
he sought it by the path which alone leads to 
it. There is no doubt that he popularized, so 
to speak, his art ; but he did not vulgarize it. 
His pictures are refinement itself, wonderfully 
executed withal, but a child can enjoy them. 
At the exhibitions, a painting by Millais had 
always its crowd of admirers before it; and 
their admiration was spontaneous and sincere. 
He painted for the public, and he painted the 
sort of pictures the public could understand 
and like and which would sell. His works 
are eminently English ; they commonly tell a 
little story, convey a bit of sentiment or illus- 
trate a well-known incident in literature. Their 
technical merit is great; but their appeal is 
always a dual one the appeal to the few who 
can appreciate the skill of the artist and his 
mastery of tools and material and technical 
process, and to the many who see nothing in a 
picture save its theme. Millais was far and 
away the most popular of latter-day English 
painters a capable, sound, naturally gifted, 
and rarely versatile painter, but hardly, we 
imagine, destined in the future to be accounted 
a painter of high and original genius. 

In writing the life of his father, Mr. Guille 
Millais has had the advantage of an unusually 
attractive and fruitful subject. Millais was a 
thoroughly wholesome, genial, and manly char- 
acter, preeminently a man with the social gift 
and the faculty of winning friends. Into the 
story of his career is unavoidably woven the 
richly anecdotal record of his professional and 
personal association with the celebrities of his 
time. It was the fashion to be painted by 
Millais, just as it had been the fashion to be 
painted by Reynolds. The chiefs of the world 
of politics, of literature, of fashion, sat to him 
as a matter of course; and wherever Millais 
found a sitter he made a friend. Of these con- 
nections of his father's Mr. Millais has freely 
availed himself, and his pages are brightened 
with many a capital story of men and women 
of whom the world likes to read. The real 



importance of the book lies, of course, in the 
fact that the name of Millais is the greatest 
and most significant one in the history of mod- 
ern English painting. That history cannot be 
told without reference to the influence and 
achievements of Sir John Everett Millais. 

In a thoughtful and discriminative little 
book that may be read to advantage in con- 
nection with the lively and reminiscential nar- 
rative of Mr. Guille Millais, Mr. A. L. Baldry, 
a competent art writer of a rather philosoph- 
ical turn, discusses the work of Millais and its 
bearing upon the artistic trend and production 
of his time. Disclaiming the intention of go- 
ing in detail into the personal history of Mil- 
lais, though he sets forth in a special chapter 
the essential biographical facts, Mr. Baldry 
proceeds to weigh and analyze the result of his 
intervention, as an artist, in the aesthetic move- 
ments embraced within the period of his career. 
The story of Pre-Raphaelitism is outlined, and 
its import, aim, and ultimate effect are satis- 
factorily brought out, although, of course, 
there is not much said of the movement except 
in so far as it was embodied in the career of 
Millais. A general introductory chapter on 
the history of the British School of painting 
paves the way for a due appreciation of that 
famous episode which was, be it said, not 
altogether without its ridiculous side, and of 
which its heroes seemed in their riper years to 
be just a little ashamed. Rossetti, especially, 
the least amiable of the mystic original trio, 
came finally to seriously resent any mention of 
the P. R. B. In 1880, as his brother records, 
he said testily to Mr. Caine : 

" As for all the prattle about Pre-Raphaelitism, I am 
weary of it, and long have been. Why should we go 
on talking about the visionary vanities of half-a-dozen 
boys ? What you call the movement was serious enough, 
but the banding together under that title was all a 
joke." 

To a lady who, about 1870, innocently asked 
him if he was " the Pre-Raphaelite Rossetti," 
he testily replied, " Madam, I am not an * ite' 
of any kind; I am only a painter." But, adds 
his brother, " it is not the less true that in 
1848 and for some years afterwards he meant 
a good deal by calling himself Pre-Raphaelite, 
and meant it very heartily." 

Mr. Baldry's book presents a very good re- 
view of Millais' purely professional career, 
and it is copiously and attractively illustrated. 
There is a chronological list of paintings re- 
printed from Mr. M. H. Spielmann's " Millais 
and his Friends."

MAKIN*. MIR MOST OF LIFE.* 

The author of the " History of European 
Morals," the " History of Rationalism," and 
" Democracy and Liberty," has now issued an- 
other work, which will add to his already con- 
siderable reputation. The subject of this latest 
book, although nowhere explicitly stated, is, 
in effect, " How to make the most of life." The 
point of view is somewhat Baconian in assum- 
ing throughout the interest of the individual as 
paramount in the discussion. 

After consideration of the value of reason- 
ing upon happiness, and the different means of 
attaining it, the author accepts, with some qual- 
ification, the English method of seeking happi- 
ness through improved circumstances. A few 
general rules follow, including Carlyle's gospel 
of work, and Ovid's * [In] medio tutissimus 
ibis." But the Utilitarian philosophy is found 
insufficient : virtue is not to be identified with 
happiness, notwithstanding their intimate rela- 
tion. Unselfish interests are commended, de- 
spite the harm that has been done in the world 
by disproportioned compassion. Different ages 
have had different moral standards, the moral 
influences of the present being much more 
various and complex than in the past. Our 
civilization is primarily an industrial civiliza- 
tion, and our current virtues (as prudence, and 
the like) are the result rather of Industrialism 
than of Christianity. Science, too, has affected 
our judgments of right and wrong. While the 
world will never greatly differ about the essen- 
tial elements of right and wrong, there is likely 
to be a steadily increasing tendency to judge 
courses of conduct mainly by the degree in which 
they promote or diminish human happiness. 
Our moral judgments are extremely fallible 
when we attempt to measure degrees of guilt, 
and therefore our criminal code should be con- 
fined as much as possible to acts which more 
directly injure others. Human nature is neither 
essentially depraved uor essentially perfect : 
the origin of evil lies mainly in the weakness 
of the distinctively human quality, and the 
chief need is a restraining conscience, in the 
absence of which law and society are called 
upon to impose the needed restraint. Political 
and commercial dishonesty are publicly con- 
doned in a degree which raises a doubt whether 
social morality in England and America has 
not seriously retrograded in these respects.

Yet moral compromise is one of the great 
lessons of life. In the fictitious conventions of 
society, in the suspensions of the moral law 
exemplified in war, in the swerving from strict 
right on the part of the advocate and the judge, 
in the adherence of statesmen to a political 
party while voting for the details of law-making, 
in the adjustment of conflicting religious beliefs 
and forms of worship in the church itself, in 
all these fields of human activity there exists, 
and there must exist, a compromise between the 
moral ideal and the existing circumstances. 

A chapter follows upon the management of 
character, commending a happy childhood, ap- 
plauding athletics in moderation, and approv- 
ing that kind of education which acts upon the 
desires and the will. " Money," " Marriage," 
" Success," " Time," and " The End," are the 
captions that follow. Money is a genuine ele- 
ment of happiness, but its value in this regard 
decreases rapidly in proportion to its amount. 
" Whatever else marriage may do or fail to do, 
it never leaves a man unchanged," and so 
should be approached with consideration which 
shall take account of all the facts. Success 
depends upon character more than upon for- 
tune, and upon tact as much as upon either. 
If time be spent proportionately in work and 
pleasure and sleep, life will prove long enough ; 
and death is not to be dreaded, nor to be un- 
duly thought of : as long as a man is living 
right, he may leave the end to take care of itself. 

It is impossible, in thus briefly stating, fre- 
quently in the author's own words, some of the 
main ideas in a book like this, to do justice to 
his details and his perspective. In particular, 
the judicial quality of mind that marks all Mr. 
Lecky's thinking, and the multitude of his 
historical references, past and contemporary, 
elude such a summary. 

Among the subsidiary ideas that strike the 
reader is the statement that the diminution of 
disease and the prolongation of average human 
life that have been achieved by medical science 
are not necessarily accompanied by a corre- 
sponding improvement in the general health of 
the people ; one cause of this state of things 
being the saving of the lives of children consti- 
tutionally weak, who thus grow up and propa- 
gate feeble offspring. Again, vivisection is 
defended, and also field sports that involve the 
destruction of animals. In the Irish land legis- 
lation of Gladstone and his followers, the sym- 
pathy of the writer is strongly on the side of 
the landlords, who have been deprived of their 
rights of contract by parliamentary proceedings

which are characterized as fraudulent. The 
author's farthest departure from a judicial atti- 
tude is exemplified in frequent derogatory ref- 
erence to the Roman Catholic Church, though 
even here it is but just to say that facts are 
commonly cited to confirm the position taken. 
Those phases of Anglican ritual that approach 
the Roman ceremonial are deplored, while full 
recognition is given to the conspicuous place 
the Anglican clergy has taken in English liter- 
ature, poetry and prose. The military unrest 
that pervades Europe is summarized in a single 
pithy sentence : " After eighteen hundred 
years' profession of the creed of peace, Christ- 
endom is an armed camp." 

The American reader will note that the num- 
ber of young men of ability preparing for the 
service of the English Church is said to be 
diminishing, and will compare this testimony 
with the evidence on this side the Atlantic that 
the hold of the Church upon the people is re- 
laxed, whatever be the cause. He will contrast 
the " aggravated treachery and perjury " as- 
cribed herein to John Boyle O'Reilly with the 
action of Boston in 1896 in accepting an artistic 
monument to this Irish poet-patriot, to remain 
in her public ways so long as the stone shall 
endure. And he will note with pleasure, in a 
discussion of the ethics of war, the following 
tribute to American humanity : 

" The great civil war in America probably contrib- 
uted not a little to raise the standard of humanity in 
war; for while few long wars have been fought with 
such determination or at the cost of so many lives, very 
few have been conducted with such a scrupulous ab- 
stinence from acts of wanton barbarity." 

It is fitting that the quality of this note- 
worthy book should be judged by one or two 
further extracts, chosen with intention to give 
specimens of the author's method of handling a 
subject, and his rhetorical style. First, we will 
take a passage representing reflection upon a 
general topic, which, however, will suggest 
actual American conditions : 

" There is one belief, half unconscious, half avowed, 
which in our generation is passing widely over the 
world and is practically accepted in a very large meas- 
ure by the English-speaking nations. It is that to 
reclaim savage tribes to civilization, and to place the 
outlying dominions of civilized countries which are an- 
archical or grossly misgoverned in the hands of rulers 
who govern wisely and uprightly, are sufficient justifi- 
cation for aggression and conquest. Many who, as a 
general rule, would severely censure an unjust and un- 
provoked war, carried on for the purpose of annexation 
by a strong Power against a weak one, will excuse or 
scarcely condemn such a war if it is directed against a 
country which has shown itself incapable of good gov- 
ernment. To place the world in the hands of those who 



can best govern it is looked upon as a supreme end. 
Wars are not really undertaken for this end. The 
philanthropy of nations when it takes the form of war 
and conquest is seldom or never immixed with selfish- 
ness, though strong gusts of humanitarian enthusiasm 
often give an impulse, a pretext, or a support to the cal- 
culated actions of statesmen. But when wars, however 
selfish and unprovoked, contribute to enlarge the bound- 
aries of civilization, to stimulate real progress, to put 
an end to savage customs, to oppression, or to anarchy, 
they are now very indulgently judged even in the many 
cases in which the inhabitants of the conquered Power 
do not desire the change and resist it strenuously in the 
field." 

Again, as a bit of description of a concrete 
fact, somewhat surprising to those unacquainted 
with the English method of taking a "division " 
of a vote in Parliament, this may be quoted : 
" Every member of Parliament is familiar with the 
scene, when, after a debate, carried on before nearly 
empty benches, the division bell rings, and the mem- 
bers stream in to decide the issue. There is a moment 
of uncertainty. The questions ' Which side are we ? ' 
1 What is it about ? ' may be heard again and again. 
Then the Speaker rises, and with one magical sentence 
clears the situation. It is the sentence in which he an- 
nounces that the tellers for the Ayes or Noes, as the 
case may be, are the Government whips. It is not argu- 
ment, it is not eloquence, it is this single sentence which 
in countless cases determines the result and moulds the 
legislation of the country." 

Mr. Lecky's book shows the result of wide 
reading. Among the writers with whom the 
author shows familiarity are Tocqueville, Hugo, 
Rousseau, Mme. de Stael, among the French ; 
Goethe, of the Germans ; Shakespeare, Tenny- 
son, Lamb, Swift, Gibbon, Darwin, Hamerton, 
Mrs. Browning, and Cardinal Newman, of 
British writers ; and of Americans, Emerson, 
Franklin, Cable, and Hawthorne. Of the 
thinkers of an earlier day, reference is made 
to Plato, Tacitus, Seneca, Propertius, Marcus 
Aurelius, and Thomas Aquinas. Carlyle has 
been read with peculiar appreciation, which is 
proved not only by the frequent mention of 
this author by name, but also by the assimila- 
tion of Carlylean thoughts and phrases. The 
book is plainly the mature product of a mind 
accustomed to view and reflect upon life in the 
many phases of its present and past activity. 
It is seldom that one gets a sweep of vision 
that includes, on the one hand, the Reforma- 
tion and its concomitants, and on the other so 
recent events as the Jameson raid and the 
Dreyfus case. Seldom is philosophical reflec- 
tion so combined with a mastery of concrete 
details, in a result which, whatever the reader's 
opinions, will awaken his thought and increase 
his knowledge.

TIIK EGYPT OF TO-DAY.* 



He who has once tasted the water of the 
Nile, longs for it inexpressibly forevermore " 
so runs the Arab proverb ; and to read Mr. Pen- 
field's book on * Present-Day Egypt," so ad- 
mirably published by the Century Co., is to 
feel the proverb's meaning. We have plenty 
of guide- books and histories dealing with Egypt, 
but this volume is neither a guide-book nor a 
history. It is, rather, a collection of impres- 
sions, appreciations, facts, opinions, and de- 
scriptions, arranged in a somewhat desultory 
fashion, and often showing less literary than 
other merits. Perhaps it gives a truer unity 
of impression for its very miscellaneity. For 
where else in the world can we find the equal 
of Egypt for thriving under that which is in- 
consistent and unsystematic? The volume 
boasts no great descriptive charm, yet it is vivid 
and certainly enables one to get something of 
life in Cairo and Alexandria. Of course there 
is the Egypt of the scholar, and its glories, like 
the light upon the Mokattam Hills, are always 
upon the Egypt of the tourist. Of the two 
Egypts, Mr. Penfield gives us the latter. He is 
not an archaeologist by trade, and he handles 
history a trifle generously as when he allows 
Plutarch to become a contemporary of Cleo- 
patra. His interests are those of the man of 
affairs ; and while he does admirably share with 
his readers something of the opera bouffe that 
is one element of Egyptian life to-day, at bottom 
he is more concerned with the complicated prob- 
lem of Egyptian administration. It is his com- 
ment upon this subject which, in the light of 
his peculiarly advantageous position as Diplo- 
matic Agent of the United States, gives the 
book value to the student of modern history. 

The administration of Egypt to-day is prob- 
ably the most remarkable of any country of its 
size and importance. Because of bankruptcy 
resulting from the conscienceless " promotion " 
of the Suez Canal by De Lesseps, and the fab- 
ulous prodigality of Ismail Pasha, Egypt is 
really governed by several European countries, 
though the Khedive has a nominal independ- 
ence, limited only by his loose relations with 
Turkey. As a matter of fact, the country has 
really gone into the hands of a receiver En- 
gland who, in the person of Lord Cromer, is 
managing all of its affairs. Thanks to this

receivership, Egypt is growing rich. Its fella- 
heen are getting to be landed proprietors in a 
small way ; the Delta is covered with cotton, 
the Nile is lined with sugar factories, and its 
waters are even now being dammed into new 
serviceability to agriculture and electricity ; 
the railroad, which will soon run from Cairo to 
Khartum if not to Cape Town already 
clears fifty-seven per cent of its gross income ; 
while the exports have risen from fifty-five 
millions in 1880 to sixty-six millions in 1896. 
These results of English occupation make one 
look with interest for Mr. Penfield's judgment 
upon the matter. It is candid, and, to say the 
least, certainly does not rest upon Anglomania. 
Mr. Penfield is a friend of Khedive Abbas, 
and one feels throughout the book an effort to 
keep from expressing certain sentiments con- 
cerning England's general attitude. Nor are 
criticisms upon England's administration want- 
ing. But notwithstanding all this, Mr. Pen- 
field says : 

" Is Egypt capable of self-government ? The can- 
dor prompting one, after long and disinterested study 
of Egyptian matters in the country itself, to say that 
England has performed her self-appointed task better 
than any other nation could have performed it, likewise 
compels one to state frankly that Egypt is not capable 
of complete self-government at the present time, for she 
has no class of officials trained in the higher ranges of 
administrative work. No other nation should ever be 
permitted to supplant England as administrator or 
' occupier ' certainly " (p. 333). 

It is such judgments as this and one meets 
them frequently that give the volume a value 
quite above its descriptions and anecdotes. In 
Mr. Penfield's opinion, English " occupancy " 
has proved beneficial to Egypt in almost every 
particular, and would (so it is fair to interpret 
some of his statements) be even more beneficial 
if the anomalous international courts and offi- 
cials were abolished. As to the future, he is 
cautious but equally candid. With the com- 
pletion of the great dam at Assuan, the tillable 
area of Egypt will be greatly increased, and 
England will be all the less likely to give up 
what she has so sturdily won. 

" A dozen years hence, all that portion of the Nile 
valley from the Mediterranean to Khartum and farther 
south will be represented in school-books as a pendant 
from Britain's red girdle of the globe. How it is to be 
accomplished, legally and morally, is a matter regard- 
ing which I do not conjecture. In time, something may 
' turn up ' helpful to the legal aspect of England's posi- 
tion in Egypt." 

And may we not venture to hope that the moral 
aspect as well will be recognized ? Is there not 
certain to be, sooner or later in international

law, a sort of " right of eminent domain " that 
will not allow an unprogressive, selfish, or mis- 
governed little nation to stand in the way of 
universal progress ? The idea may be visionary, 
but any careful reader of Mr. Penfield's book 
will certainly feel that the interference of En- 
gland in Egypt, so violent and questionable at 
the start, and to-day so much at variance with 
the proclamations of Wolseley and Seymour 
during the Arabi rebellion, is a strong argu- 
ment in its favor. At all events, the volume 
itself is timely and worthy of being widely read.

VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HAWAII.* 

The many lines of interest which converge 
in the cosmopolitan life of the Hawaiian Is- 
lands make it possible to present their story 
from different points of view. This is well ex- 
emplified in the many recent books upon the 
subject. 

Lieutenant Lucien Young, of the United 
States Navy, was on the " Boston," stationed 
at Honolulu for seven months prior to, and also 
following, the overthrow of the Hawaiian mon- 
archy. Believing that the Blount report un- 
fairly represented the diplomatic and naval 
officers of the United States, he requested per- 
mission to print his account of the incident, but 
was denied the privilege. This has since been 
granted by Secretary Long, and his report was 
published as " The ' Boston ' at Hawaii," a re- 
vised and enlarged edition of which is now at 
hand under the title " The Real Hawaii." The 
book is crammed full of descriptive matter of 
an unusually wide range from the point of view 
of a very observant naval officer. While much 
of this is not new, it is unusually complete and 
is tersely told ; and an appendix of statistical 
data adds further to its usefulness. Of espe- 
cial interest are the chapters upon the natural 
resources of the country and upon land tenure. 
The main feature of the book, however, is the 
narrative of the Revolution, which gives not a 
little inside history of the events which cul- 
minated in the overthrow of the monarchy.

This is minutely related with especial reference 
to the charges subsequently made against Min- 
ister Stevens and Captain Wiltse. The blunt 
sincerity of the tale will at least go far toward 
confirming the opinions of the author's fellow 
partisans. He is confessedly an advocate, and 
spares no pains to advance his case and to be- 
little his opponents. Barring this excess of 
zeal and some uneliminated repetitions, the 
book is a welcome addition to the literature of 
the subject. 

Miss Mabel Craft represented some of the 
leading American newspapers in the Islands 
during the last days of the Republic, and in 
her " Hawaii Nei " she writes of recent events 
and of the more picturesque phases of Hawai- 
ian life. Her book is interesting indeed, 
there is not a dull page in it ; and her well- 
chosen themes are not hackneyed. A keen eye 
for the picturesque, a facile pen, and a piquant 
style assist her sympathetic portrayal of the 
wronged native, the oppressed laborer from the 
Orient, and the persecuted witch-doctor, and 
add spice to her righteous indignation at the 
millionaire missionaries with their chill New 
England ways who have invaded this Eden. 
Miss Craft has evidently taken her cue from 
the stratum of Honolulu society which was in 
favor at the court of the recent queen a point 
of vantage for access to certain phases of Ha- 
waiian life which she alone of recent writers 
has fully portrayed. But there are other circles, 
alike of native and of Anglo-Saxon constitu- 
ency, whose acts and motives she neither ade- 
quately understands nor justly portrays, and too 
often indiscriminately condemns. Discerning 
readers will enjoy her book, though they may 
smile at her zeal for her friends, and may be 
compelled at times to adjust her rhetoric to the 
facts of history. The illustrations are new, 
appropriate, and well executed. 

In her " Transformation of Hawaii," Miss 
Belle M. Brain has prepared for young readers 
a brief account of the work of evangelical mis- 
sions among the Hawaiian people. The book 
contains well-selected descriptive matter, and 
more than the usual reference to the native 
tongue. The story of the great religious awak- 
ening of 1837 to 1843 comes from a sympa- 
thetic pen. The relation of Hawaiian missions 
to similar work among other Polynesian and 
among Micronesian peoples is explained, and 
the interesting history of the children's mis- 
sionary ship, " The Morning Star," is told at 
length. The entrance of the Roman Catholic 
mission is described, but those who seek a full

account of the present religious status in the 
islands must look elsewhere for example, to 
Professor Blackman's book for statistics 
showing the spread of Catholicism and Mor- 
monism, and for an account of the revival of 
paganism and the defection from and present 
decline of the native evangelical churches due 
to social and political causes. The author has 
failed to portray the survival of the missionary 
spirit and the varied religious and philan- 
thropic agencies still at work in the transfor- 
mation of these islands. 

From these books of passing interest, one 
turns with pleasure to the substantial and schol- 
arly work of Professor Blackman upon " The 
Making of Hawaii." It is a serious study of 
the social and economic conditions of the prim- 
itive Hawaiian race, and of the introduction 
and rapid growth of the institutions of Western 
civilization in the midst of a population of ever 
increasing complexity. We quote from his 
preface : 

" The Hawaiian Islands afford better facilities, per- 
haps, than any other field for a study of some important 
social problems. This fact is due to the blending there 
of the temperate and tropical climates; the admixture 
of divers and widely different races; the contact of 
civilized and native peoples under unique conditions, 
and with results in some respects unexampled, and in 
all respects instructive; the collision of the Christian, 
the secular, and the pagan, each in very vital forms; 
the rapid evolution from a primitive to a highly devel- 
oped condition of the four fundamental and perduring 
social institutions, the family, the Church, the State, 
and property; the control of industries by corporations, 
to an unusual degree; the close juxtaposition in recent 
years of the wealthy few and a poor multitude, and 
all this within narrow and manageable limits of time, of 
area, and of population." 

The author divides his subject into the earlier, 
middle, and later periods, the last constituting 
the greater part of his work and treating of 
present-day problems of general interest. A 
spirit of unusual candor pervades his treatment 
of the missionary movement, and its successes 
and failures in the moral, religious, and ethical 
regeneration of a people of low ideals debased 
by contact with the vices of Anglo-Saxon civil- 
ization. The growth of constitutional law and 
the legal code is traced from the chaotic con- 
ditions of the early feudal life to the annexa- 
tion of the republic. Land tenures and the 
distribution of land holdings are treated very 
fully, while the commercial and industrial 
development is discussed more fully than in any 
recent work. The causes of the decline of the 
native race are inquired into, and the Asiatic 
invasion is condemned. In the matter of con- 



tract labor, the pros and cons of which are 
impartially given, the author is inclined to 
think that white labor has not yet had a fair 
trial, and that better wages and a better class 
of labor are not impossible under present eco- 
nomic conditions. The author is also sanguine 
as to the success of the Anglo-Saxon in tropical 
colonization, at least in these islands. The 
work is to be commended for the spirit of can- 
dor in which all vexed and debatable questions 
are discussed, for the breadth of view with 
which topics of wide import are treated, for the 
perspective manifest in the choice of material 
presented, and for the thoroughness with which 
the task has been completed. It is a standard 
work for all who wish a judicial estimate of 
the social, economic, and political factors at 
work in the making of American civilization in 
the Hawaii of to-day.

RECENT FICTION.* 



A new era seems to have dawned in our Amer- 
ican historical fiction. During the last year or two, 
the subject of the American Revolution has been 
dealt with by three writers upon a largeness of scale 
and with a wealth of equipment that quite outdis- 
tance the sketchy and episodical narratives to which 
we have hitherto been accustomed, and which takes 
us back, in one direction, to " The Spy, 1 ' and in 
another to " The Virginians." Of Dr. Mitchell's 
"Hugh Wynne" and Mr. Churchill's "Richard 
Carvel " we have already spoken at some length ; 
our third novel is Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's " Jan- 
ice Meredith." The whole subject of the Revolu-

tion is too complex to be brought readily within the 
scope of a single work of fiction, if anything like 
unity of plot is to be preserved, and Mr. Ford has 
done wisely in not attempting so much as that. But 
his work does cover, and with reasonable thorough- 
ness, these phases of the struggle that were centred 
about Pennsylvania and New Jersey, together with 
the closing years of the campaign in the South. 
And we feel an unusual confidence in our guide 
through this tangle of battle, of military plot and 
counterplot, from the fact of his thorough scholar- 
ship, so well approved by his numerous books of a 
more formal historical character. Mr. Ford em- 
bodies the rare combination of a wide and accurate 
knowledge of the facts of history with the peculiar 
talents of the novelist. His characters are drawn 
to the life, although it must be admitted that he is 
a shade less successful with the figures he takes 
from history than with those whom his imagination 
creates. His Janice is one of the most winsome 
of creatures, feminine to the finger-tips, and spark- 
ling with animation. The hero is hardly less attrac- 
tive in his sterner way, and the whole group of 
private characters about whom the story centres 
are made very real to us by the creative skill of the 
writer, deftly reinforced as it is at so many points 
by bits of antiquarian fact and flashes of light upon 
colonial ways of thinking and living. The closest 
parallelism which the work suggests is with that 
fine novel of an earlier period, Miss Mary Johnston's 
" Prisoners of Hope." In both cases the hero is a 
" redemptioner " loved by the daughter of a master 
who has all the crusted prejudices of a gentleman 
of the old school. The likeness of the two books 
in this respect is too striking to be overlooked. But 
Mr. Ford need not be offended by this comparison, 
for he would be the first to recognize the excellences 
of the book which he calls to mind. Beyond this, 
his treatment is his own, and we have to thank him 
most cordially for his picture of a stirring time and 
a great action. Few novels of the year will be 
likely to equal " Janice Meredith " either in interest 
or in wholesome instructiveness. 

Recollections of that study in chromatic emotion, 
The Red Badge of Courage," and of the ineffec- 
tual pieces of realism by which it was followed, have 
not led us to expect work of any sort of real inter- 
est and value from Mr. Stephen Crane. His repu- 
tation seems to have risen like a rocket amid the 
glare of colored fires, and come down to earth like 
.the proverbial stick. It is, then, with considerable 
surprise that we find in " Active Service " a novel 
which, while not exactly meritorious according to a 
serious standard, is at least readable and entertain- 
i n g> by virtue of having a real story to tell, and of 
telling it with much effectiveness. The story is of 
an American journalist in love with the daughter 
of a college professor. The professor takes his 
family to Greece, together with a class of archaeo- 
logical students, and gets into a position of much 
difficulty by reason of the war with Turkey. The 
journalist constitutes himself a relief expedition, for 



personal reasons no less than for the glory of his 
" yellow " newspaper, extricates the party from the 
clutches of the Turk, and marries the young woman. 
The story is not without grave faults. The profes- 
sor is a caricature, and his students are of the slangy 
sort that would never by any possibility be found 
members of such a party as is described. The jour- 
nalist is an example of the " smart " and unscrup- 
ulous type developed by the most objectionable sort 
of newspaper enterprise, and the young woman for- 
feits our sympathies by caring at all for such a 
fellow. But the story has consecutive development 
and abundance of excitement, for which qualities it 
may be exempted from complete condemnation. 

" A Confident Tomorrow," the latest novel by 
Mr. Brander Matthews, is everywhere charming, 
although in no respect to be characterized as pow- 
erful. It is a story of New York society, and of 
the career of a young man from the West who seeks 
his fortune in the field of letters. The crudity of 
his culture, when he makes his early appearances 
upon the scene, appears to us a little overdone, and 
it is something of a strain to believe that even a 
young man from Topeka would, under all the cir- 
cumstances, accept social invitations upon postal 
cards, or think ready-made clothing the proper ap- 
parel for evening entertainments. The somewhat 
colorless young woman with whom he promptly falls 
in love is not depicted with an attractiveness so 
convincing as to account for his passion, and when 
the affair is settled between them at the end, it 
rather takes us by surprise. But of the lighter 
graces of fiction-writing Mr. Matthews has enough 
and to spare. The bit of decorative incident, the 
humorous or pathetic episode, the easy small talk 
of office and drawing-room, all these things are done 
to the life, done almost as well as Mr. Howells 
could do them, and this finished sort of detail is 
what constitutes the real charm of the novel. The 
literary "shop" talk, which is necessarily intro- 
duced over and over again, is absolutely convincing 
in its naturalness, and provides the novel with one 
of its most satisfactory features. 

Mr. Horace Annesley Vachell has promptly fol- 
lowed up his recent success with " The Procession 
of Life " by a new novel of California entitled " A 
Drama in Sunshine." The new book is a story of 
land-speculation and the unscrupulous methods by 
which the foundations of more than one Calif ornian 
fortune have been laid during the last fifty years. 
The character of the heroine is the principal achieve- 
ment of the novel, and her purity and strength go 
far to soften its otherwise sordid and repellant 
theme. The man upon whom she bestows her love 
is a weak creature, ethically considered, although 
he stands in the eyes of the world as the type of 
aggressive will and outward success. At the end, 
some sort of moral regeneration seems to be begin- 
ning in him, as he is brought face to face with the 
danger of losing the woman whom he has at last 
learned to value at her true worth. There is much 
vivid description in the work, and an excellent sense

of dramatic effect We are brought into close con- 
tact with the realities some of which are grim 
indeed of the fresh and feverish life of the far 
West, and we feel that this life, at least in certain 
of its more obvious phases, has found in the author 
a stronger and more clear-sighted exponent than it 
has hitherto had save in the person of Mr. Bret 
Harte. Mr. Vachell's style is thus far too nervous 
and direct to allow of the higher finish, but even 
in this respect he has been gaining rapidly since his 
first publications, and there seem to be in him the 
makings of a novelist of the better sort. 

Sermons in the guise of fiction have been over- 
much our lot in recent years, but we do not often 
have to reckon with a tract so unabashed as " Henry 
Worthington, Idealist" It might have for its sub- 
title " an argument in defence of the Consumers' 
League and a protest against educational endow- 
ments of questionable origin." Indeed, some such 
prefatory heralding of its purpose seems almost 
morally obligatory in this case, for Miss Margaret 
Sherwood, the author of the book, has an excep- 
tional command of the literary graces, and the 
power to make a dull theme attractive by virtue of 
keeping fast hold of the fundamental human inter- 
ests concerned. Her book is an intensely feminine 
production, feminine in its many minute details and 
in the exaggeration of sentiment wherewith it is 
infused. It turns upon a university endowment 
provided by a merchant whose gains are derived 
from a system of department stores in several large 
cities. The social and economic evils attendant 
upon this form of gainful occupation are pictured 
with passionate indignation rather than with calm 
acceptance of all the facts involved, and when the 
merchant sets aside a portion of his wealth for ed- 
ucational uses, he encounters the earnest opposition 
of a young teacher in the favored institution, who 
investigates the origins of this wealth and denounces 
its acceptance by the university as the condonation 
of a crime. As a matter of course, this youthful 
idealist is promptly dismissed by the trustees ; but 
compensation comes to him with the love of the 
merchant's daughter, who views her father's wealth 
with a like abhorrence. We say as a matter of 
course, meaning simply that the demands of the 
writer's scheme make this outcome imperative, and 
not that such a dismissal, made in such a way, 
has much inherent probability. There has been 
much talk of this sort of persecution during re- 
cent years, but we are inclined to doubt that such 
things really occur, and we are quite sure that they 
never occur as here described in other words, 
that college professors in good standing are dis- 
missed from their posts in secret session, and with- 
out even knowing that they are being arraigned, 
because their teaching differs from the opinions 
held by the authorities. The thing is so overdone by 
the present novelist that her book loses all real 
force. Written with the best of intentions, and 
inspired by the finest of idealism, it is not dispas- 
sionate enough to carry weight, and the evils whirh 



it assails require a more careful analysis than they 
are here given. We wish in closing to pay a re- 
newed tribute to the noble spirit of the work whirh 
Miss Sherwood has sought to do, and to the skill 
in characterization which makes her book so read- 
able, despite its lack of intellectual balance and its 
excess of emotionalism. [~ ~~| 

The posthumous novel of Mr*. Blanche Willis 
Howard von Tenfel deserved a better title than the 
awkward " Dionysius the Weaver's Heart's Dear- 
est," which is as Teutonic in its ungainliness as 
much of the dialogue which it contains. The dia- 
logue has this character of necessity, because it be- 
longs to a group of Swiss peasants, whose rude, 
direct form of speech is reproduced with admirable 
fidelity. It is a simple story, almost wholly con- 
cerned with one person, the beloved daughter of 
the weaver, and the heroine of whatever plot the 
story may be admitted to possess. It is the life- 
story of this girl, of her successful career, her one 
error, and her atonement. She has her own notions 
of right and wrong, and refuses to allow her life to 
be utterly wrecked by a single act of wrongdoing. 
Her independence and directness of character, her 
native scorn of the shams encouraged by conven- 
tional society, and her determination to live her own 
life in accordance with her own standards of con- 
duct, are presented to the reader with singularly 
appealing force, and admiration for her virtues is 
mingled with pity for her fault. The book is not 
of the writer's best, and has numerous pages that 
might easily be spared, but the story which it has 
to tell commends itself to all honest sympathies. 

It is some time before the reader comes to under- 
stand why Miss Cholmondeley's " Red Pottage " 
should be (as it seemingly is) the English novel of 
the year. The caprices of public taste in such mat- 
ters are so inexplicable that one is inclined, by the 
time he gets half through with the book, to ascribe 
its vogue to some such popular vagary as that which 
not so long ago singled out " Trilby," and more 
recently " David Harum," for such ephemeral dis- 
tinction. The situations outlined seem strained, 
and the style is far from impeccable. Moreover, 
the interest, which at first is sharply focuseed upon 
a certain character, becomes diverted into numerous 
secondary channels, and the reader grows singu- 
larly impatient. But as the story is pursued to the 
end, and the threads so long left loose are gathered 
up into a single tragic knot, and the writer's powers 
of characterization become more and more firmly 
established, and a relentless destiny finally asserts 
its controlling and implacable claims upon all the 
lives concerned, a revision of the earlier opinion is 
forced upon us ; we are compelled to recognize the 
strength of the work, and its success is made ration- 
ally intelligible. The point of honor upon which 
the plot all hangs is an artificial one, and it may be 
held that fate deals too harshly with the hero for 
his sin, but according to the conventional code of 
the society in which he lives, there is no other pos- 
sible outcome. Yet if poetic justice is thus inex-

orably worked out in the one case, we can but feel 
that its hand is unduly stayed in the case of the other 
criminal (of so different a sort !) who is simply a 
fool, and who escapes chastisement because he is one. 
The contrast between these two offenders is one that 
extends to other characters of the novel, and which 
divides them sharply into two classes those whose 
lives are made up of thought and feeling, and those 
who live vegetable existences, never knowing what 
it is to think clearly or to feel sincerely. There is 
something impressive in the tragic irony that invests 
the life of the clergyman who figures so largely in 
this story, and makes him the instrument of a trag- 
edy which he can never even remotely comprehend. 
The chapter which deals with this episode is fitly 
headed with the motto, " Les sots sont plus a craindre 
que les me'chants." We would not convey the idea 
that the novel is all gloom. So far from having 
this exclusive attribute, it is enlivened to a notable 
degree with flashes of quiet humor, and gentle 
touches of social satire. And it is a book which 
engages the closest attention, whether for its minor 
incidents or for the larger lines upon which it is 
constructed. 

To write comedy which shall skirt the borders of 
tragedy without once overstepping the boundary 
line is no easy task, but this is what Miss Violet 
Hunt has done, and done with charming success, in 
"The Human Interest." We get very close to the 
danger-point in one scene, but even then the situa- 
tion is saved by the opportune death of a husband 
who is distinctly in the way, both of his wife and 
of the novelist's plans. This device is a trifle banal, 
but banality is the last attribute to be credited to 
Miss Hunt's work as a whole, for that work offers 
audacious groupings, epigrammatic dialogue, and 
general sprightliness of manner, all of which quali- 
ties combine to make a book in which hardly one 
dull page is to be found. 

Kings have always figured largely among the 
heroes of romantic fiction. Their exalted station, 
and the artificial splendors that hedge them about, 
have proved irresistible magnets to the imagina- 
tions of novel-writers and to the interests of novel- 
readers. Given an attractive kingly personality for 
the central figure, and the success of a romance was 
already half-assured. But the king as a psycho- 
logical type, as a special character-study to be 
viewed from within, is a comparatively new devel- 
opment in fiction. The interest with which such a 
character may become invested in the hands of a 
master-craftsman of letters is evident enough to 
those who are familiar with Herr BjOrnson's " Kon- 
gen " and Heer Couperus's " Majesteit." It also 
becomes evident in the latest novel of Mr. " Anthony 
Hope," entitled " The King's Mirror." The naive 
question put in " Huckleberry Finn," " How much 
does a king get?" is typical of the new curiosity 
about kings which such books as these serve to 
gratify. " The King's Mirror " takes the form of 
an autobiographical narrative in which the life of 
royalty, from childhood to maturity, the conditions 



and prescriptions which set a king apart from other 
men, are set forth with much insight and human 
sympathy. This is the life-story of a real king, not 
of a puppet like the ruler of Buritania, and it is told 
with convincing truthfulness. It is much the finest 
piece of work that the author has thus far done, 
although we must warn its readers that it provides 
less of mere entertainment than his earlier ro- 
mances. But it certainly marks an advance in his 
art, and in the power of his appeal to the serious 
intelligence. 

Mr. Egerton Castle's " Young April " is also, in 
part, a book about a king, but here the interest is 
purely romantic, and nothing in the nature of 
psychological insight is for a moment displayed. 
The escapade of a young English nobleman, just 
emancipated from tutorial thraldom, and plunged 
into the intrigues of a petty German principality, 
forms the theme of this captivating tale. A group 
of deeply interesting characters, both men and 
women, set in a variety of passionate interrelations, 
hold the attention absorbed, until a brief month is 
past, and the scene dissolves. It is a romance of 
the springtime of life when a few weeks may 
hold in quintessence all the reality vouchsafed to a 
whole lifetime, and, having taken flight, leave noth- 
ing behind but the embers of passion, and " a world 
of memories and sighs." The diction of this book 
is strange and beautiful, riotous in its expression of 
surging emotion, and marred only now and then by 
some infelicitous word, some Gallic construction, 
some sense of incongruity arising from an occasional 
realistic brush-stroke upon the imaginative canvas. 
But it is not pleasant to be over-critical in the pres- 
ence of such full-blooded romance, and the book has 
so many exquisite pages that the few lapses from 
its inherent idealism may well be permitted to pass 
unmentioned. It is a book to enjoy and not to 
dissect. 

In writing " The Courtship of Morice Buckler," 
Mr. A. E. W. Mason proved himself one of the best 
of our contemporary romantic novelists, and his 
name upon a title-page is an unquestionable pass- 
port to popular favor. The name now reappears 
upon two title-pages, that of " Miranda of the Bal- 
cony," where it stands alone, and that of " Parson 
Kelly," where it is associated with the name of Mr. 
Andrew Lang. A close comparative study of these 
two books would yield some interesting results. Mr. 
Mason's own unaided work is a tale of Englishmen 
and Moors with a Spanish setting. It offers a great 
variety of incident, skilfully handled, although re- 
lying too much for the loosening of its knots upon 
those coincidences and contretemps that rarely hap- 
pen in real life, and that strain the credulity of 
readers well nigh to the breaking point. The loose 
threads of the plot are in the end most ingeniously 
interwoven, and the product is undeniably enter- 
taining. The romance has, moreover, an impres- 
sive degree of virile strength, and is constructed 
with such economy of material that it must be read 
carefully in order to avoid missing some essential

link in the narrative. In the joint work of Mr. 
Mason and Mr. Lang, on the other hand, there is 
a tendency to indulge in episodical matter that is 
not so essential to the development of the story, 
and the setting of the whole, while still romantic, 
is also historical, and more conscientiously histor- 
ical than is usually the case with books of this sort. 
In a word, " Parson Kelly " is a romance of the 
Jacobite plottings of the quarter-century that led np 
to the Forty- Five, and the minute historical detail 
must be credited to Mr. Lang, whose intimate ac- 
quaintance with the subject is equalled by few pro- 
fessional historians. To him, also, must be credited 
many a quip, conceit, and scholarly allusion, all of 
which bear the unmistakable stamp of his peculiar 
talent These matters supply the very salt of the 
work, and, although Mr. Mason's name takes the 
first place upon the title-page, we find much more 
of Mr. Lang's handiwork in the contents. The 
story itself is one of the most readable that have 
come to our notice of late years, and deserves warm 
commendation, both as a study of the historical 
period concerned, and as a specimen of the novel 
of plot, counterplot, and intrigue. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

m, 

Mr. Francis Marion Crawford adds himself to 
the number of novelists who have explained that 
their portraits in literature are not mere photo- 
graphs, in the little preface he has written for the 
new holiday edition of " Saracinesca " (Macmillan). 
It speaks ill for the discernment of his readers, and 
those of the other novelists who have made similar 
explanations recently : or is it that the realist is 
really in the saddle to an extent which assumes all 
romance to be history written small? Much more 
to the point is the inference of the author here that 
it is the humanity of the book which has given it 
twelve years of unfading popularity and now calls 
forth this admirable two-volume edition with all 
Mr. Orson Lowell's delightful photogravures and 
pen drawings. The book is human as human as 
" Patient Grisel " and its persistence in the face 
of an overwhelming majority of feminine readers 
indicates less emancipation than many have hoped. 
The Italian character has never been more skilfully 
interpreted to an alien audience than in the three 
novels of which this is the first and best ; and this, 
though not given by Mr. Crawford among his rea- 
sons for survival, is assuredly not the least of them. 
Just at this time, when Latin civilization is in apo- 
gee, it is worth while recalling from the pages of 
"Saracinesca" the half- forgotten fact that all peo- 
ples are from the same root, and all European peo- 
ples and their descendants sufficiently close to make 
the interest of one a concern for all. 



The elaborately illustrated edition of u , Janice 
Meredith" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) attests both the 
liking of the public for its author, Mr. Paul Leices- 
ter Ford, and for the Revolutionary times which 
are commemorated in it. A curious bit of history 
lies in the fact that we are getting nearer our great- 
great-grandfathers' days in books in inverse pro- 
portion to our regard for their precepts in actual 
life. Janice has a double set of friends, and the 
colored medallion portrait which Mrs. Lillie V. 
O'Ryan has made of the gently gallant heroine jus- 
tifies them all. Another miniature, of the General 
George Washington whose farewell address has 
come into disrepute among American statesmen of 
late, is from the Sharpless original, and serves as 
frontispiece to the second volume. The black-and- 
white illustrations are by Mr. Howard Pyleand his 
pupils, exhibiting all the painstaking attention to 
the costume and architecture of that time which 
have always marked this artist's work. The story 
itself is of sufficient worth to bear these extraneous 
aids without loss of dignity, the effect being un- 
usually harmonious. 

More than holiday interest is lent Charles Reade's 
" Peg Woffington " (Doubleday & McClure) by Mr. 
Austin Dobson's "Introduction," replete as it is 
with that essayist's charming erudition respecting 
eighteenth century people and places. If Mr. Reade 
idealized an actress who has always had a peculiar 
charm for the folk on both sides of the footlights, 
Mr. Dobson gives us the real woman quite without 
the adventitious glamour of natural beauty or stage 
artificiality and both are lovely, with a touch of 
pathos which makes them lovelier. The task for 
both writers is the easier because of the lack of 
precise knowledge respecting pretty Peggy, enabling 
the artist to fill out the slight sketch which authentic 
history furnishes with radiant colors from his own 
palette. If her life, as Mr. Dobson says, was hardly 
to be ranked as " either worshipped or blameless," 
it was more and less exciting both love and 
pity. We can hardly, now that this Introduction 
has been furnished the novel, conceive of the novel 
without it. And the pictures of Mr. Hugh Thom- 
son are scarcely less essential, now they have been 
introduced to us. 

The playwright was careful to keep " Becky 
Sharp" distinct from Thackeray's "Vanity Fair," 
but the substantial unity of the two is manifest in 
what is called the " Becky Sharp " edition of the 
great " novel without a hero " now published by the 
Harpers. Forty-eight photographs of Mr. Minnie 
Maddern Fiske and her fellow-players have been 
reproduced in half-tone for the illustration of the 
work, the stage costumes and accessories, strictly 
achronistic, adding to their effectiveness. The test 
is, of course, a severe one; for not only must the 
actors conform themselves to the requirements of 
the stage, but they must also look the parts in re- 
pose, and in the face of those readers whose pre- 
possessions are, for example, in favor of Thackeray's 
own drawings. These latter, lacking as they were

in some respects, are filled with spirit and are neces- 
sary for the comprehension of the book ; yet we can 
imagine the delight with which the author would 
welcome the sympathy here given by a sister art 
and its fellow-artists. 

That sterling critic of art, Mr. Cosmo Monk- 
house, has performed a most valuable and unusual 
task in his fine quarto, " British Contemporary 
Artists" (Scribner). The word "contemporary," 
describing as it did the series of essays when they 
were conceived less than six years ago, has ceased 
to be applicable to Leighton, Millais, and Burne- 
Jones, whose work nevertheless will not be taken 
as work of the past. Mr. Monkhouse regrets that 
the principle of seniority gives Mr. George Fred- 
erick Watts the first place : we fail to see the ap- 
plication when the final pas has been given by the 
King of Terrors to these others even while we 
agree with his reasons for objection. A mystical 
seven are named in the book, the others being Mr. 
William Quiller Orchardson, Sir Lawrence Alnia- 
Tadema, and Sir Edward J. Poynter. All were, 
of course, members of the Royal Academy. The 
book is illustrated with considerable profusion, full- 
page engravings from the works and smaller repro- 
ductions from sketches and studies lending point 
to the questions raised in the text. Incidentally, 
though this was doubtless part of the critic's orig- 
inal intention, there is a tolerably complete survey 
of the present status of painting in England, which 
makes the work of more than ordinary interest. It 
is one of the chefs d'oeuvre of the season in all re- 
spects. 

One of the prettiest and freshest of the season's 
lighter and more essentially ornamental and pic- 
torial publications comes to us from Colorado 
from away out in Colorado, so far from Attic 
Boston. But if Boston itself has produced this sea- 
son anything so pretty and tasteful in its modest 
kind as the flat octavo volume entitled "Colorado 
in Color and Song," published by Mr. Frank S. 
Thayer of Denver, we have thus far failed to see 
it. Mr. Thayer, if we mistake not, is the enter- 
prising gentleman who several years ago published 
a book containing, as alleged, photographic views 
of live wild animals of the region in their native 
haunts, after negatives secured on the spot by a 
noted hunter who, in the interests of education and 
the book trade, kindly consented for a season or so 
to substitute a camera for his Winchester. It after- 
wards leaked out that the animals photographed 
were stuffed and mounted specimens of indigenous 
fauna, which had been wheeled out into the rural 
environs of Denver and there appropriately posed 
before the camera of the "noted hunter," who, be- 
ing a man of some humor, entered with spirit into 
Mr. Thayer's little joke. The reviewers of the book 
generally were "taken in " by it ourselves among 
the number. But we bear Mr. Thayer no malice, 
and, on the contrary, hasten to say that his present 
venture is a very attractive one in which there lurks 
not the slightest possibility of a hoax. The native 



poets represented in it appear to be, with hardly 
an exception, alive and not stuffed ; and its speci- 
mens of Colorado scenery are as indubitable as 
grand. There are twenty-four full-page plates, in 
colors, showing Hanging Rock, the Palisades, Gate- 
way to the Garden of the Gods, Seven Falls, Ute 
Pass, Royal Gorge, Manitou, Ouray, Twin Lakes, 
Platte Cafion, Cathedral Rocks, etc. Each plate is 
printed on heavy paper, and the verses facing and 
accompanying it are on tissue bond. The side-stamp 
on the cover is a bit of mountain landscape in nat- 
ural colors set in a gilt frame of Florentine pattern. 
The work is at once a decidedly interesting Colo- 
rado souvenir and a charming Holiday book. 

Another fine volume of the steadily-growing lux- 
ury edition of Mr. George W. Cable's works of 
fiction (Scribner), " Les Grandissimes," illustrated 
by Mr. Albert Herter, is in all respects a worthy 
example of American book-making at its best. A 
eover design of pond-lilies distinguishes the book 
externally. Within, the essential quality of French 
life in Louisiana has been caught by the artist 
and reproduced in not less than a score of photo- 
gravures, carefully conceived, excellently wrought, 
and fully interpretative of the novel. In size, the 
volume is a large octavo, its proportionate thickness 
being achieved by the use of heavy paper, making 
the turning of the leaves a pleasure in itself. When 
the series is completed, Mr. Cable will have a literary 
and bibliophilic monument granted to few writers. 

England, seen by the appreciative American eyes 
of Mr. C. J. Taylor, whose sketches are published 
by Mr. R. H. Russell, is as foreign and as home- 
like as it must always be to us. There are no 
fewer than eighty large drawings in Mr. Taylor's 
collection, nearly all in tone, interpreting the sim- 
ples and gentles, the city and country, the haunts 
of Shakespeare and Carlyle, and the resorts of 
'Arriet and her 'Enery. The humor of the work is 
broad upon occasion, and the social side of English 
life is brought out very clearly and in marked 
contrast to the more sorrowful pleasures of the 
United States. The art of interpreting these dif- 
ferences in terms common to both peoples is pecu- 
liarly the province of this interesting and amusing 
book, for which we are greatly indebted to the 
artist. Why can 't an Englishman Mr. Phil May, 
for example do as much for us? 

Perhaps when Mr. William Dean Howells's vari- 
ous and admirable qualifications as a novelist and 
prose-artist are considered separately, none of his 
qualities may take higher place than what may be 
called his " happiness." This shows with more than 
usual plainness in " Their Silver Wedding Journey " 
(Harper), a luxurious holiday edition of which, in 
two volumes, now makes its timely appearance. To 
take our old friend March that average Ameri- 
can who is the transatlantic Pendennis with all his 
differences and our good friend Mrs. March, who 
stands for the most creditable work of modern civ- 
ilization, the American woman, vingt ans aprbs 
plus five more, and send them abroad, is a device as

ingenious as it is interestingly instructive in its re- 
sults. The illustrations for this edition, some in 
half-tone reproductions from photographs, others 
from drawings by artists of repute, add to the reality 
of the work and increase its many charms. 

Mrs. Elisabeth Luther Gary writes a valuable 
summary of the work of one of the great English 
poets, entitling it, " Browning, Poet and Man : A 
Survey " (Putnam), choosing the word " survey," as 
she says, because she has relied rather upon the 
work of others than on any investigations of her 
own. Tet the work is vigorous at times if not orig- 
inal ; and gives a tolerably fair collective view of 
the poet's virtues and literary faults. It is filled 
with good pictures, most of them portraits of Brown- 
ing and his more famous contemporaries and friends, 
the rest being scenes from his works. The book is 
a worthy commemoration of a life of great accom- 
plishments and many charms. 

That commingling of art and history which is 
oftener attempted than realized makes pleasant and 
profitable reading of "The Stones of Paris in His- 
tory and Letters" (Scribner). It is written by Mr. 
Benjamin Ellis Martin and Mrs. Charlotte M. Mar- 
tin, quite in the spirit of Mr. W.C. BrownellV- French 
Traits," and justifying the dedication to that essay- 
ist. The idea of the book is to follow the fragments 
remaining of the walls of Philip Augustus, bringing 
to light half-recalled, half-forgotten relics of the past, 
ancient, mediaeval, and modern. There are eleven 
several essays in the two volumes, bearing such 
typical titles as "The Scholars' Quarter of the Mid- 
dle Ages," " Moliere and his Friends," " The South- 
ern Bank in the Nineteenth Century," and "The 
Paris of Victor Hugo." Many illustrations add to 
the interest of the pleasant, chatty volumes, which 
preserve the literary feeling and charm throughout. 

A reissue of Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie's " My 
Study Fire" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is welcome at 
this time or any other. The present addition has 
to commend it further the numerous illustrations 
from the pencils of those gifted young women, the 
Misses Maude Alice and Genevieve Cowles. These 
pictures take the form common enough to-day, 
but none the less charming of little symbolic 
sketches and suggestions scattered through the 
pages, besides the well-drawn men and women of 
the narrative whose imaginative portraits for once 
do not disturb the reader's ideals. To the lover of 
literature or of life, the volume makes equal appeal. 

If one could have personal acquaintances like the 
characters in the " Essays of Elia" ! Charles Lamb 
left the feeling of placid intimacy in his work, and 
we have gone on making editions of it, year by 
year, showing the one appreciation of the work we 
are able to show by reading and re-reading it. 
Just now, Mr. Augustine Birrell has written an in- 
troduction and Mr. Charles E. Brock has made pic- 
tures for a sumptuous two-volume edition imported 
by the Scribners, differentiated as " Essays " and 
"Last Essays." In Mr. Bin-ell's selection there is 
a certain appropriateness, since he represents, if any- 



one, the playfulness and fancifulness of Elia himself 
if one could conceive of an Elia in the end of the 
century ! 

Mr. Robert Barr has gone travelling, and "The 
Unchanging East, or, Travels and Troubles in the 
Orient" (Page) is the two- volume product of his 
wanderings. Mr. Barr is a good hand at finding 
amusement and even comparative comfort out of 
situations otherwise hardly endurable. He shows 
the American's understanding of foreigners rather 
than a Briton's aloofness, and he thus exhibits to 
his readers the sympathy they do not always find 
in accounts of Eastern life. The Mediterranean, 
Antioch, Damascus, Jerusalem, these form the 
text for pleasant and profitable discourse. The 
book is fully illustrated, in photogravure, etc., and 
has a cover design which is particularly successful. 

Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's "Child Life in Colonial 
Days" (Macmillan) is both a holiday book and a 
book for children the two being so closely com- 
bined as to make it equally within either category. 
What it is, the title and Mrs. Earle's other work of 
the same genre abundantly indicate. A wide read- 
ing of earlier American history, biography, and cor- 
respondence, a good sense of fitness and proportion, 
a sure knowledge of the eternally interesting child- 
ishness which age cannot wither, a keen eye for the 
picturesque, the bizarre, and the interesting all 
these things are combined with illustrations attest- 
ing similar qualities to produce a living whole. We 
have long known our ancestors as heroes ; we are 
now learning them over again as husbands, wives, 
fathers, mothers, youths, hobbledehoys, giggling 
females," and babies. Will the Filipino of the 
Twenty-first Century like Macaulay's New Zea- 
lander find in such books an indication of national 
decay ? 

We should like Mr. Joseph Jacobs *s "Tales from 
Boccaccio" (Truslove, Hanson & Cotnba) better if 
there were more of them. True, among the four 
chosen for this handsome volume, appear "Griselda," 
u Saladin and Torello," and Isabella," two of which 
gave rise to great English poems. But when the 
translator himself tells us, in a pleasant introduc- 
tion, that seventy-two of the hundred tales in the 
Decamerone " are not more broad than they are 
long," and the connecting links or machinery of the 
book are quite as free from trespass upon modern 
convention, why should he so limit himself? Were 
the turning from Italian to English less successful, 
the feeling of deprivation would be less strong. 
One compensation is found in Mr. Byam Shaw's 
delicate and artistic interpretations of the text, 
which are both beautiful and profuse. 

Garlands of prose, quite as much as garlands of 
poetry, are characteristic of the day. The latter 
come, it may be, from the distaste felt for verses by 
most Americans; the former, in all probability. 
from the desire to place varied information at the 
disposal of the reader. All such books, like others 
affording a more or less royal road to learning, are 
probably enervating in their effect; but it is still

difficult to believe this of such a book as " Great 
Pictures Described by Great Writers " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The book is compiled by Miss 
Esther Singleton, whose "Turrets, Towers, and 
Temples" of last year will be recalled. She has 
drawn freely on the great writers of England and 
France and Germany for her descriptions, trans- 
lating from the two foreign tongues herself the ex- 
cerpts needed for her purpose. The result is a 
well-rounded whole, the greatest works of the great- 
est painters being turned into literature by the 
greatest writers in Europe nearly all of the critics 
being modern, and many of them living. The 
painters range from Bordone and Botticelli to 
Goenze and Turner, with illustrious examples from 
Spain, Germany, and Holland in profusion ; while 
Pater and Ruskin, the De Goncourts and Ste. 
Beuve, Goethe, and Thausing, with many more, 
supply the text. There will even be found Mr. 
Swinburne's comment on Rossetti's " Lilith " 
why not also his sonnet from the "Heptalogia" ? 
The final touch of interest is given by a profusion 
of illustrations of the pictures discussed, of 
course which contrive to give one an almost 
adequate idea of their excellence in spite of the 
process work which has made them possible. 

Good editions of the Sonnets of Shakespeare are 
nnmerous and varied, but we can recall none more 
attractive to the eye than that lately issued by the 
Roy croft Printing Shop of East Aurora, N. Y. The 
volume is unillustrated, and contains no Introduc- 
tion or critical matter of any kind. The text is 
printed in bold-faced type on a fine quality of hand- 
made paper, and the binding is of plain dark paper 
boards with back and corners of a rough cinnamon- 
colored leather. The initial letters throughout the 
book, drawn by Mr. W. W. Denslow, are colored by 
hand in the same deft and artistic way that has 
made this feature of the Roycroft publications such 
a distinctive one. In many respects this is the most 
satisfactory volume that the Roycrofters have pro- 
duced as yet, and a choicer Christmas gift for a 
book lover could hardly be found. 

As artistically beautiful as it is wittily droll, Mr. 
Oliver Herford's "Alphabet of Celebrities" (Small, 
Maynard & Co.) has the pictures and letter-press 
as they appeared in " Life." But to these have 
been added a border and initial letters by Mr. 
Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, with a cover design 
and end papers by Miss E. B. Bird, the whole be- 
ing profusely rubricated. That unexpected and 
almost irreverent turn of the fancy which is char- 
acteristic of Mr. Herford's rhymes appears at its 
best here. What could be more ludicrously incon- 
gruous than this? 

" A's Albert Edward, well meaning but flighty, 
Who invited King Arthur, the blameless and mighty, 
To meet Alcibiades and Aphrodite." 

Unless it be the accompanying picture, which shows 
the British King lowering and the Greek leader 
leering at the goddess, while the heir apparent 
stares from eyes absurdly Guelph. 



The author of " Vacation Days in Hawaii and 
Japan," Mr. Charles M. Taylor, Jr., has been tak- 
ing another vacation in Great Britain, this time 
and " The British Isles through an Opera Glass " 
(Jacobs) is the pleasant result. The title might be 
held as an indication of a journey with the objects 
to be viewed held at rather more than arm's length, 
but it may be taken to indicate that the author's 
camera enables the reader to see what he saw as 
through an opera-glass. The tour began in France 
and extended through England, Scotland, and Ire- 
land. While there is little new for the traveller in 
the book, it is freshly told, and not without a cer- 
tain crispness of impression, such as characterized 
the former book from the same hand. 

Readers of the illustrated literary magazines have 
seen from time to time pictures of Mr. H. Rider 
Haggard in the guise of a practical student of agri- 
culture. They may now read a book in which this 
attitude is maintained throughout "A Farmer's 
Year, Being his Commonplace Book for 1898 " 
(Longmans). There is no airy pretense about the 
work, nor writing de haut en bas. Mr. Haggard 
has evidently been at it long enough to have gained 
profound respect for tillers of the soil, and his views 
are practical, set forth month by month in the ap- 
proved manner of this most ancient art. With all 
the rest, there is a reposeful and pleasantly literary 
manner, such as we have looked for in vain in this 
author's successive novels. A combination of the 
two methods would result, we are convinced, in 
something better than he has yet done, though this 
last book is a desirable acquisition in itself. 

Mr. J. Campbell Phillips has eyes to see for him- 
self and a pencil to draw " Plantation Sketches " 
(Russell). The old South and the new are drawn 
with comprehension and kindliness, interpreted in- 
dividually through the negro boys and girls who 
are to constitute a problem for the next generation 
to solve or leave alone. There is true humor in 
the sketches humor with the thought of tears at 
no great distance, and they should serve to give 
the North a better understanding of what these 
brave and tender-hearted fellow-citizens of ours 
really are. 

Miss Howard Weeden not only draws the Negro, 
but she sings him as well, in " Bandanna Ballads " 
(Doubleday & McClure). Mr. Joel Chandler Harris 
writes a brief introduction, in which he extols the 
fidelity of the work and its timeliness in catching 
the old house-servant who was much more " gentle- 
folks " than either his successors in service or in 
masterhood. " A new generation has arisen," says 
Mr. Harris, " and it has become incredulous and 
skeptical in regard to the traditions and legends of the 
old plantation in general, and of the old-time quality 
negro in particular." This is true in the North as 
well as the South, and the " Bandanna Ballads " 
will be a treasure to all those families which have 
enjoyed the perfect devotion of the older kind of 
servant depicted in them. In addition to these bal- 
lads, which have no such merit in the literary sense

M belongs to the delightful picture*, the author's 
" Shadows on the Wall," which had so marked a 
success when privately printed, are subjoined. 

"Kemble's Sketch Book" (Russell) contains a 
score or so of that humorous illustrator's "coons," 
together with a sprinkling of other odd types a 
Florida 'gfttor hunter, an " Old Sport," an over- 
seer, a Kentucky mountaineer, a Cape Cod ancient 
mariner or two, and so forth. The drawings are 
rough but expressive, and the publication is as 
modest in price as in make-up. 

The publications of Mr. T. B. Mosher for the 
present season include twelve volumes, six of which 
are in the " Brocade " form and four in the " Old 
World" series, while the other two give us Mr. 
J. W. Mackail's translation of the " Georgics " of 
Virgil as companions to the single volume of the 
" Eclogues " published a year ago. The new " Bro- 
cade" booklets give us two more of the old French 
romances translated by William Morris, add a new 
number to the Pater set of " Imaginary Portraits," 
and give us also " Hours of Spring and Wild Flow- 
ers," by Richard Jeffries, " Will o* the Mill," by 
Robert Louis Stevenson, and Dr. John Brown's 
ever-delightful " Marjorie Fleming." The new 
44 Old World" books are divided equally among 
prose and verse. The two prose volumes are Miss 
Alexander's " The Story of Ida," as introduced by 
Mr. Ruskin, and Mr. George Meredith's little- 
known " Tale of Chloe." The two volumes of verse 
are Christina Rossetti's " Monna Innominata " and 
Stevenson's " A Child's Garden of Verses." Of the 
mechanical charm of all these publications, and of 
their peculiar fitness for gift purposes, we have 
spoken so frequently in the past that there is noth- 
ing new left to say. 

A pretty and inexpensive gift for a friend of 
musical tastes would be a copy of Mr. Henry C. 
Lahee's <' Famous Violinists of To-Day and Yester- 
day" (L. C. Page & Co.). The volume is daintily 
bound in white with elaborate peacock and floriated 
design in gold, and contains ten portraits of famous 
mextros, Ole Bull, Corelli, Paganini, Joachim, San- 
ret, Ysaye, etc. The writer has endeavored to give 
a " bird's-eye view " of the most celebrated violin- 
ists from the earliest times to the present day, rather 
than a detailed account of the very few ; and those 
who have won fame as public performers have been 
selected in preference to those who were best known 
as teachers. There is a general Introduction, a 
chapter on Famous Quartettes, and a Chronological 
Table. The little book is pleasantly and intelli- 
gently written, biography, anecdote, and criticism 
being blended in due proportion. 

We own that we have always been rather imper- 
vious to the pictorial fan of the late M. A. Woolf. 
It always appeared to as a little flat, and of the 
sort usually made in England for home consump- 
tion. Mr. Woolf s specialty as a humorist was the 
drawing of very diminutive and supernaturally rag- 
ged and "slummy " children, and making them talk 
(by means of a line or so of text underneath) like 



grown-up people in flourishing circumstances. But 
that Mr. Woolf had his admirers is undeniable; and 
to all such the flat oblong quarto entitled Sketches 
of Lowly Life in a Great City " (Putnam), and con- 
taining over 150 of his drawings, will appeal. Most 
of the pictures are selected from the artist's contri- 
butions to "Life " and "Judge," but some of them 
have never before been published. The Biograph- 
ical Note informs us that Mr. Woolf was born in 
England. We suspected it. 

Sidney Lanier's study of a mocking-bird, in the 
best manner of Mr. Burroughs or Mrs. Miller, is 
brought out in a most elaborate form by the Scrib- 
ners. This accurately picturesque story of a bird, 
from near the egg until, like most wild things, it 
died by violence, has its virtues enhanced by the 
combined art and industry of Mr. A. R. Dugmore, 
who made repeated photographic studies of mock- 
ing birds at various ages, finally coloring the best 
of these and using them as illustrations here. A 
brief comment on the lamented Lanier's habit in 
regard to living nature is prefixed by his son, Mr. 
Charles Day Lanier ; while the book closes with the 
little-known sonnets "To Our Mocking- Bird, Died 
of a Cat, May, 1878," by way of lending a final 
charm. 

That there should be demand enough for Moore's 
" Lalla Rookh " to warrant putting forth a super- 
illustrated edition of that masterpiece of senti- 
mentality at this time, will be a surprise to many. 
The beauty of the edition (Dana Estes) is marked 
enough to justify its existence, if only for the pic- 
tures. The artists contributing to this result in- 
clude Messrs. Kenyon Cox, W. H. Low, F. S. 
Church, Frank Myrick, W. L. Taylor, and many 
more. The book is substantially a re-issue of the 
edition of fifteen years ago. 

An artistic, quaintly fancied little publication, 
with a distinctive savor of the book-stall or other 
haunt of the Nimrod of the old and curious in book- 
making, is "The Kings' Lyrics" (R. H. Russell), 
being a selection of lyrical poems of the reigns of 
Kings James I. and Charles I., together with Dray- 
ton's Ballad of Agin court. Mr. Fitzroy Carring- 
ton is the editor. The selections are made with 
taste ; but why has Mr. Carrington, especially in a 
Caroline anthology in which so much space is given 
to poems of a religious cast, entirely omitted 
Vaughan who, to our thinking, is, at his inspired 
best, almost better than any of his fellows at their 
best. There are nine selections from Herbert, and 
four from Crashaw. Campion, Carew, Drummond, 
Herrick, Lovelace, Quarles, Shirley, Suckling, and 
Wither are liberally represented. There are por- 
traits of the two kings, and of most of the poets ; 
and the pleasant suggestion of archaism is carried 
into the typography. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis's publishers have 
dealt nnally with his fiction. Anything more en- 
ticing than the six pocketable little volumes, in their 
flexible bindings of olive-green leather stamped 
in gold with title and design, it would be difficult 



1899.]

to imagine. The print is handsome and the paper 
of good quality, and each volume contains an etched 
frontispiece. The titles comprise : " Gallegher," 
" Soldiers of Fortune," " The King's Jackal," " The 
Lion and the Unicorn," and " Cinderella." 

Mr. Samuel Minturn Peck, the American golfers' 
laureate, has supplied the seven sprightly poems of 
the links that form the text of the showy flat quarto 
entitled " The Golf Girl " (Stokes), and Miss Maud 
Humphrey is responsible for the accompanying 
colored plates. Miss Humphrey's pictures are 
bright and pleasing, and we rather think they are 
portraits. If such be the case, we beg leave to 
compliment her on her taste in selecting her models. 
The young man who " golfs " should look up this 
pretty publication in the course of his Christmas 
shopping. 

" Famous Actors of the Day in America " (Page), 
like its predecessor dealing with the actresses, is 
from the pen of Mr. Lewis C. Strang.' In brief 
space it sets forth the virtues of twenty-five men, 
representing all the living generations, from Mr. 
Joseph Jefferson to Mr. Otis Skinner, in the history 
of the American stage. Counterfeit presentments 
of these brilliant players, generally in some one of 
their favorite roles, eke out the characterizations of 
the text, which are sound rather than brilliant. Mr. 
Strang would have us think he had left behind him 
the blandishments of the theatrical advance agent ; 
nevertheless he has preserved a portion of that 
scintillating functionary's vocabulary to his own 
misdoing in sentences here and there. 

" Cupid and Coronet" (Russell) is a little story 
told in pictures with a thread of little needed 
text by Mr. Malcolm A. Strauss. It is a port- 
folio book after the manner of Mr. Charles Dana 
Gibson. It would hardly be fair to assume that it 
would not have been done at all if it were not for 
Mr. Gibson ; but it cannot well be imagined other- 
wise. 

The author of the book whose extended title has 
been shortened by use into plain " Mary Powell " 
may well rejoice in the beautiful printing of " The 
Colloquies of Edward Oaborne " (imported by 
Scribner), with its ten drawings by Mr. John Jel- 
licoe. The book has added to its own merit these 
skilfully executed illustrations, fine paper, beautiful 
type and printing, rubricated title-page, and all the 
careful detail which make a finished work of the 
printer's art. 

The more men find themselves in the unnatural 
world of city streets and city clangor, the more 
they turn with longing to the mild pleasures of the 
field and garden. It was so in imperial Rome, it is 
true of unimperial New York and Chicago. So "A 
World in a Garden" (Macmillan), by Mrs. R. Neish, 
is a welcome addition to a library none too rich in 
georgics. The book is something more than mere 
horticulture. It has the life of man, with its pleasures 
and pains, uncertainties and compensations, bound 
up in the conduct of the friendly flowers. The photo- 
gravure illustrations are exceptionally charming. 



Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish in a single 
small volume, delicately bound in white and gold, 
" Poems by Keats and Shelley." The selections 
from Keats are : " La Belle Dame Sans Merci," 
" Isabella," " The Eve of St. Agnes," and " Lamia "; 
those from Shelley are : " The Cloud," " To a Sky- 
lark," " Ode to the West Wind," " The Sensitive 
Plant," "The Witch of Atlas." The text is clearly 
printed on light-glazed paper. There are a number 
of drawings, full-page and wash, by Mr. Edmund 
H. Garrett, whose work is pretty and graceful as 
usual. But the frontispiece of " Isabella," it must 
be admitted, is in our poor judgment a sad thing, 
and a quite libellous conception of that lugubrious 
damsel. The Lycius (p. 92) is much better, and 
the " water-lilies," on page 42, is as charming as 
unpretentious. 

Mr. Elbert Hubbard's "Little Journeys to the 
Homes of Celebrated Painters" (Putnam) is a 
bright and chatty little book, packed with anecdotes 
and racy ana, and not devoid of solid information, 
which is conveyed in a colloquial and popular style, 
sometimes a thought too free-and-easy to fit the 
subject. Ten painters are treated : M. Angelo, 
Rembrandt, Rubens, Meissonier, Titian, Van Dyck, 
Fortuny, Ary Scheffer, Millet, Reynolds, Landseer, 
and Dor. Mr. Hubbard's book is very liberally 
and very pleasingly illustrated with portraits of the 
painters and choice examples of their work. 

The early life of old New York has yielded ma- 
terial for a number of pleasant volumes, and Mrs. 
Amelia E. Barr has produced such a one in " Trin- 
ity Bells " (J. F. Taylor & Co.). The work has a 
charming little Dutch maiden for a heroine, and 
some stirring episodes are added from our wars 
with the Algerian corsairs in the Mediterranean. 
There are sixteen full-page illustrations, and the 
volume has a pretty cover design showing the 
Trinity bells whose silvery music rings through the 
story. 

"Legends of Switzerland" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
is the unpretentious title of a fourth volume of Miss 
H. A. Guerber's series dealing with the myths which 
have gathered about the sturdy little republic and 
its various cantons. History and myth are here 
mixed in unequal measures, the realms of art and 
nature being drawn on for the accompanying pic- 
tures in half-tone. So pure a republican democracy 
as this deserves American study and sympathy, and 
both can be given it by means of this pleasant work. 

That tour de force of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, 
" The Brushwood Boy," is issued in a small volume 
by Messrs. Doubleday & McClnre, illustrated by 
Mr. Orson Lowell with his usual artistic discrimina- 
tion. The plates, which have genuine worth, suffer 
somewhat in the printing, those interspersed through 
the text not showing with the clearness which was 
evidently intended. The story is an evident one, of 
course, and requires no exegesis, pictorial or verbal ; 
but it is the gainer by such work as this. 

The rapidity with which the modern world 
changes is shown by nothing more clearly than the

Charles Dickens built his great novels. The work

Dickens's place in literature is sure, and enthusiasm 
is permissible. Here, however, the insistent use of 
The Master " and similar terms carries it to the 
point of sentimentality. 

The second series of " Some Colonial Mansions " 
(Coates) is bound uniformly with the first, and re- 
sembles it closely in plan and scope. Mr. Thomas 
Allen Glenn still acts as editor, which seems to be 
too slight a title to indicate all his multifarious ac- 
tivities. Not only does he write historical sketches 
of leading families in America before the Revolu- 
tion, preparing in several instances genealogies and 
lists of living descendants of them, but he describes 
the houses they lived in, including the Washingtons 
at Mount Vernon, the Jeffersons at Munticello. the 
Rawles at Laurel Hill, the Philipses at Philips- 
borough, the Waynes at Wayneaborough, and the 
Prestons, Schnylers, and Macphersons. The book 
is accurate and painstaking, and the work as a 
whole promises to attain a high place among recent 
historical researches. 

Mr. Charles Keeler writes and Miss Louise Kee- 
ler decorates "A Season's Sowing " (A. M. Robert- 
son), a book of quatrains and couplets, nearly all 
with didactic purpose. The book is unusually well 
executed; the press work (done in San Francisco) 
commending it to all those who like white paper 
and black ink properly applied thereto. The deco- 
rations, too, deserve much praise ; but the illustra- 
tion by which is meant the figure-drawing more 
particularly is not so happy nor of equal merit 
As a work of western art, taken in all its bearings, 
it deserves many encomiums, and the metropolis of 
the Pacific States is to be congratulated for mak- 
ing it possible. 

A pretty, well-planned introduction to Raphael 
a Raphael primer, one may call it is the 
modest little volume of the " Riverside Art Series," 
compiled by Miss Entelle M. Hurll, containing a 
frontispiece portrait of the painter, together with 
half-tone reproductions of fifteen of his pictures, 
with general introduction and running interpreta- 
tion and commentary (Houghton). The subjects 
selected for illustration are largely such as have a 
certain narrative or literary interest, the portraits 
being ignored and the Madonnas but slightly repre- 
sented, while the text has only the modest aim of 
making the pictures intelligible. Hi.-toncal data 
are relegated to the tables, and the Introduction is 
intended for teachers, with whom the volume should 
find favor. 

A brace of rather taking and fairly practical pic- 
torial calendars come to us from Mr. R. H. Ii,i--rll: 
the -'Zodiac Calendar," with pictuies by Mr. Ches- 



ter Loomis, and "A Revolutionary Calendar," with 
pictures by Mr. Ernest C. Peixotto. Mr. Loomis's 
work is in comic vein; and his up-to-date handling 
of our old zodiacal friends. Aquarius, Pisces, Tau- 
rus, Cancer, and Co., is sufficiently amusing. Pat- 
riotism is Mr. Peixotto's refuge (we don't mean to 
be personal), and he has adorned each of the twelve 
sizable cards of his calendar with pictures supposed 
to illustrate such events as Paul Revere's Ride, the 
Lexington and Bunker Hill fights, the Retreat from 
Long Island, the Surrender of Cornwallis, etc. As 
patriotism of the " strenuous " order is in the air 
just now, Mr. Peixotto's stirring almanac will doubt- 
less find many admirers.

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

IL 

From the books for the yonng received 
8 ' nce tne ' n8ta ' ment treated in THE DIAL 
for December 1, it is still possible to 
make a selection which will be all that the childish heart 
desires, no matter what the age of the person fortunate 
enough to possess it. Indeed, these books remaining, 
though fewer in numbers, are of an even higher stand- 
ard of excellence, indicating either more care in their 
preparation, speaking broadly, or that the best have 
been saved for the last. When we "oldsters" look 
upon these marvels of book-making, it is with a double 
sigh: of regret that we were not so favored in our 
own days of complete appreciation and unjaded tastes, 
and of wonder as to what manner of book will be turned 
out for our children's children a long generation hence. 
Among really notable literary achieve- 
ments, addressed to youne people and their 

J 

elders rather than to children, " bpanish 
Peggy" (Stone), by Mrs. Mary Hartwell Catherwood, 
is to be given very high place. It is an account of the 
boyhood of Abraham Lincoln at New Salem, and such 
an account as quite puts the formal biographies of the 
last few years to shame, being idealized into beauty 
while retaining all the rugged fact that makes the great 
emancipator the hero of the common people. Beside 
this is Mr. Hamlin Garland's " Boy Life on the Prairie " 
( Mac-mi I Inn), a book in which the author is much more 
at home than he was in telling what little girls did 
under somewhat similar circumstances. The story of 
the circus is what any boy (and most men as well) 
would call " bully." Of a similar sort, treating of hunt- 
ing, fishing, and all manner of out-of-door life, is the 
book " .1 list About a Boy " (Stone), written by the Mr. 
W. S. Phillips who is best known under his pen-name 
of " 1 Comancho." It is health and f reshness com- 
bined. Certain to recall Uncle Remus are the tales 
gathered by a Jamaica girl, Miss Pamela Column 
Smith, from the negroes of the West Indies, and now 
published with her own illiiHtrations under the name of 
the " Annaiicy Stories" (Russell). They show folk-lore 
at its best. Mr. Gelett Burgess prefixes a touching 
essay on "The Cidivation of Inanimate Things for 
Sceptic Parents" to "The Lively City o' Ligg" 
(Stokes), which he has written and illustrated. An ap- 
peal to the tastes of all sorts and ages of men is thus 
made, as in the ease of "The Lark.*' That President 
David Starr Jordan should have told stories of his two

children, Knight and Barbara, and that these, with pic- 
tures made by those children, should now be published 
as " The Book of Knight and Barbara" (Appleton), are 
bits of good-fortune wholly unexpected. There will be 
found in the numerous tales of which the book is made 
up some old friends with new faces aud some new 
friends as well. " Pierrette " (Lane) is a lovely little 
story of a prince who was lost and found, told by Mr. 
Henry de Vere Stacpoole, with illustrations by Mr. 
Charles Robinson. Loveliness is also the characteristic 
of Miss Gertrude Smith's pretty book, " The Wonder- 
ful Stories of Jane and John " (Stone), for which Miss 
Alice Woods has provided color sketches of more than 

ordinary merit After the manner of Lewis Carroll, 

Mrs. Sheila E. Braine describes the doings of " The 
Princess of Hearts " (imported by Scribuer), the draw- 
ings being by Miss Alice B. Woodward. The resem- 
blance is more than adventitious. Quite of its own 
kind, and a fitting sequel to her former book, " Wabeno 
the Magician" (Macmillan) is an interestingly fanciful 
rendering of natural scenes and objects by Mrs. Mabel 
Osgood Wright, with admirable pictures by Mr. Joseph 
M. Gleeson. 

Rhymes, Books with rhymes and pictures, which ap- 

and pictures peal to the adult through one and the child 
with, them. through the other, are not uncommon, and 
certainly serve a useful purpose. Probably the first 
place should be awarded for originality to Miss Carolyn 
Wells's "Jingle Book" (Macmillan), for which Mr. 
Oliver Herford has made the drawings. It more than 
justifies its name, for what is thought to be the best 
alliterative jingle in the language here has place, run- 
ning as follows: " Betty Botta bought some butter; 
'but,' said she, 'this butter's bitter! If I put it in my 
batter it will make my batter bitter, but a better bit o' 
butter will but make my batter better.' Then she 
bought a bit o' butter better than the bitter butter, 
made her bitter batter better. So 't was better Betty 
Botta bought a bit o' better butter!" This out-pipers 
Peter Piper! " A Moral Alphabet in Words of From 
One to Seven Syllables " (Edward Arnold), is a repeti- 
tion of the success of the " Bad Child's Book of Beasts " 
and " More Beasts for Worse Children " of two and 
three years ago. The words are by " H. B." (Mr. 
Hilaire Belloc) and the out-of-drawings by " B. T. B." 

Not in the least for children, though hardly for any- 
body else, are the " Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless 
Homes" (Edward Arnold), by Colonel D. Streamer, 
with pictures by "G. H." It seems to be American 
humor strained through British intelligences, much to 
its worsening Any of Mr. William Nicholson's pic- 
tures are certain to be welcomed, and " The Square 
Book of Animals " (Russell) is no exception to the rest, 
though the designs for it were done in 1896. But why 
should Mr. Nicholson's excellent ideas serve as a vehicle 
to carry, first, the worst rhymes Mr. Kipling ever wrote, 
secondly, the worst rhymes Mr. Henley ever wrote, and, 
thirdly and finally here, the worst rhymes Mr. Arthur 
Waugh ever wrote? Why not try the artist so/us? 
Both rhymes and illustrations are by Mrs. Sarah Noble- 
Ives in "Songs of the Shining Way" (Russell), a thin 
but pleasing book which would have been improved 
mechanically by the use of a paper more nearly opaque. 

A single person also serves both for draughtsman 
and rhymester in" Peter Newell's Pictures and Rhymes" 
(Harper), and the combination of Mr. Newell's talents 
is most successful. " In Case of Need ( These May 
Come Handy), 5 ' published by Small, Maynard & Co.,

with the pictures, rhymes, and lettering by Mr. Ralph 
Bergengren, is a sort of "Slovenly Peter" for adults, 
its modernity attested by the use of rubaiyat for the 
verses. Both elaborate and witty, the book is eminently 
suitable for a bachelor's Christmas gift, always a diffi- 
cult thing to acquire, while it will serve a useful pur- 
pose with the married as well. There are moral head- 
ings in the " New England Primer " style, and such 
sage advice as this, eutitled " Those Who Postpone 
Will Later Groan": "Remember, Friend, the task 
that it is right to meet at its own moment, do not slight: 
He who neglects his morn-appointed shave oft finds 
scant time to shave himself at night." In every way 
commending itself, "Child Verse: Poems Grave and 
Gay " (Small, Maynard & Co.) is a delightful book of 
real poetry from the pen of the Reverend John Ban- 
ister Tabb. Almost unconscious piety is an unusual 
note here sounded most worthily. 

Without verses, but filled with pictures, 
books of the sort represented by Mr. Frank 
Verbeck's "The Three Bears" (Russell) 
are as funny as caricatures of animals funny in them- 
selves can possibly be. Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, in- 
ventor of the "Dumpies" and some other laughable 
things, has told the story of the 'possum, the coon, the 
rabbit, and the crow " In the Deep Woods " (Russell), 
to the pictures by Mr. J. M. Conde". Mr. Conde", too, 
provides the humorous drawings for Mr. C. F. Carter's 
book, " Katooticut, or The Rooster Who Wanted to Be 
Rich" (Russell), in which a dragon, a genie, and a 
nightmare flourish with the more usual types of crea- 
tion. " Animal Jokes " (Russell), the jokes by Mr. A. 
Crawford and the reproductions of the animals by Mrs. 
M. Baker- Baker, is a very funny book indeed. What 
might be styled reversed silhouettes make up the pic- 
tures in " The Sculptor Caught Napping : A Book for 
the Children's Hour " (Dutton). These are done by 
Mrs. Jane E. Cook, who cuts her pictures from card- 
board, traces the necessary detail on them with a stil- 
etto, and presents them here against a deep purple 
background. The effect is that of low relief, and very 
pleasant as well as very novel. The subjects treated 
are those of the nursery, generally speaking. 
Another Of t ne various books treating of the naval 

group of aspect of the war with Spain, Mr. Willis 

war book*. j Abbot's "Blue Jackets of 1898" 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) is by far the most accurate and 
the most interestingly written. Both bo^s and men 
will be the gainers by its perusal. Mr. William O. 
Stoddard, who wrote one of the first of the books of the 
late war, now has published a volume containing three 
stories, of which the third is a wrecker's tale, rather 
than a warrior's. It is named from the first of these, 
"Running the Cuban Blockade" (Stone), and is thril- 
ling and well told throughout. Ruth Ogden (Mrs. 
Charles W. Ide) tells how patriotic small boys and girls 
could be during the recent war, in " Loyal Hearts and 
True" (Stokes). Doubtless the little Spanish children 
were quite as loyal on their side. The rediscovery of 
our ancestors continues in Mrs. Agnes Carr Sage's "A 
Little Daughter of the Revolution " (Stokes), illus- 
trated by Miss Mabel L. Humphrey, wherein quite 
small children meet the heroes of that day Revolu- 
tionary sea-fighters begin, and the sailors of the Span- 
ish war end, Mr. George Gibbs's "Pike and Cutlass" 
(Lippincott), thus presenting a connected picture of the 
national navy. Two things about the book are not quite 
comprehensible: Why does the author take pains to 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



mention every sailor who did anything during the last 
war with the solitary exception of Admiral Schley? 
And why does he, in the pictures be drew for the book, 
depict "Fighting Bob" Evans in the uniform of the 
war of 1812 ? Were there conning towers in those 
days? Mr. Gibbs makes the pictures for Mr. M. J. 
Canavan's Ben Comee, a Tale of Rogers's Rangers, 
1758-60 " (Macmillan), which goes back of the Revo- 
lution quite a distance, but revolves around Lexington 
as a centre. One long step farther back is Mrs. Beulah 
Marie Dix's " Soldier Rigdale, How be Sailed in the 
Mayflower, and How he Served Miles Stand ish " (Mac- 
millan). The pictures are by Mr. Reginald B. Birch, 
and the book is of historical interest ' With Perry 
on Lake Erie " (Wilde) is a good story of the second 
war of independence, told by Mr. James Otis. It has 
the merit of introducing the reader to the facts prelim- 
inary to the great battle. Concerned with the Revo- 
lution again is "An Unknown Patriot" (Houghton), 
by Mr. Frank Samuel Child. It is instructive to see 
the former hatred of Great Britain slipping away in all 
these books; we are apparently as anxious to please the 
mother country now as we used to be anxious when she 
gave us dispraise in days gone by. Dr. Gordon Stables 
is belated in point of time with his " Remember the 
Maine " (Jacobs), and, we trust, in point of sentiment 
as well. The book is chiefly interesting as showing a 
British point of view. Never failing in its appeal to 
all English-speaking boys and men, the life of Sir 
Francis Drake carries a tradition for seamanship and 
daring down the ages. Mr. James Barnes has rather 
followed the beaten path of the bold captain's biog- 
raphers than marked one out for himself, as he has so 
often; but "Drake and his Yeomen" (Macmillan) is 
a good book nevertheless. Why can't Mr. Barnes 
write another and tell of Drake's singeing the King of 
Spain's beard ? 

If Mr. George Riddle had given a little 
more American verse in his "Modern 
Reader and Speaker" (Stone), it would 
have left nothing to be desired. There is surely no rea- 
son why boys should not have a chance at the good 
things of to-day as well as at those of day before yes- 
terday. That it is vastly more amusing to keep ani- 
mals and watch them than to shoot them for specimens, 
is the humane lesson of Mr. Wardlaw Kennedy's 
" Beasts, Thumb-Nail Studies in Pets " (Macmillan). 
Most of the beasts are reptiles, and a more interesting 
book could hardly be found. Miss Charlotte M. Yonge 
(familiar name) writes " The Herd Boy and his Her- 
mit" (Whittaker), a characteristic story of mediaeval 
piety, for which Mr. W. S. Staoey provides some inter- 
esting pictures. " Phil and I " (Nelson) is a story of 
an English boy and the heir of an exiled French noble- 
man during the Napoleonic wars. The times and the 
story are well set forth Real mischief -making boys 
and girls have their lives portrayed by E. Nesbit (Mrs. 
Hubert Bland) in "The Story of the Treasure Seek- 
ers " (Stokes). The children were not looking for mere 
gold. Messrs. Gordon Browne and Lewis Baumer make 

the pictures for the book in all sympathy Boys at 

school and their capacity for dramatization afford the 
fun in M Mobsley's Mohicans " (Nelson), by Mr. Harold 

Avery. The book is praiseworthy Another of the 

unwearied Mr. James Otis's books, and the third of his 
" Telegraph " series, is " Telegraph Tom's Ventures " 
(Werner). Crime and melodrama are its portion. 
Rather teaching the cruelty of slaughtering birds for 



A HUU of 

Vfy thing,

chitdrtn. 



decorative purposes than indicating any great knowl- 
edge of ornithology, " Dickey Downey: The Autobiog- 
raphy of a Bird" (A. J. Rowland), by Mrs. Virginia 
Sharpe Patterson, is still a necessary book. Intended 
primarily for children, it deserves circulation among 
their elders, so long as dead birds are used in millin- 
ery. A fourth edition of Miss Maud Menefee's "Child 
Stories from the Masters " (privately printed) will be 
welcomed by the intelligent everywhere. It is more 
beautiful than its predecessors by a cover design from 
Mr. Leyendecker's clever pencil; but its charmingly 
simple account of the great masterpieces makes it 
almost indispensable in teaching children the nobility 
of art " A Life of St Paul for the Young " (Jacobs), 
by Mr. George Ludiugton Weed, is a direct and Chris- 
tianly sympathetic account of the great missionary and 

dogmatist, not above the grasp of the childish mind 

" Ways of Wood Folk " (Ginu) is an instructive and 
pleasantly written account of forest animals and animal 
life, by Mr. William J. Long. 

The really interesting books for smaller 
children may be beaded by that excellent 
publication, "The Little Folks' Illustrated 
Annual " (Dana Estes). Both in prose and verse, the 
selections are of the sort which cannot fail to entertain 
the youngsters. "The Little Browns" (imported by 
Scribner) are a wholesome and happy set of small chil- 
dren for whose acquaintance we are indebted to Miss 
Mabel E. Wotton. A real burglar comes upon the scene 
in the guise of an uncle, and the children play detective 
in the most approved manner Another housebreaker 
is the hero of "The Burglar's Daughter" (Jordan, 
Marsh & Co.), written by Miss Margaret Pen rose and 
illustrated by Mr. Frank T. Merrill. This hero is saved 
by his little girl, whose room he enters under a misap- 
prehension, discovering his inadvertence when he is 
about to take a present he had made her. Mrs. Moles- 
worth is the author of " This and That, a Tale for Two 
Tinies" (Macmillan), the pictures being by Mr. Hugh 
Thomson in an earlier manner. The book has the merit 
of all Mrs. Molesworth's work, and shows how real and 
how trivial the grief and trouble of the child always is. 
Four of the " Nister " books are published by Duttou 
on this side of the Atlantic: " The Voyage of the Mary 
Adair," by Miss Frances E. Crompton, with pictures by 
Miss Evelyn Lanse; "Tattine," by Mrs. Ide ("Ruth 
Ogden ") ; " Honor Bright, a Story of the Days of 
King Charles," by Mrs. Mary C. Roswell, illustrated 
by Miss E. Stuart Hardy; and "The Kingfisher's Egg, 
and Other Stories," of which the first is by Mrs. L. T. 
Meade, and the others by Miss Ellis Walton, Miss Ger- 
aldine R. Glasgow, and several more. All have attrac- 
tive cover designs in bright colors, and are filled with 
pictures. "Mother Duck's Children" (Russell) is by 
" Gugu," and has decided merit. " Master Martin " 
(Jacobs) is all that the title of dignity implies, and 
there is also a child Sir Theodore in the book to give it 
an air. It is written by Mrs. Emma Marshall. Miss 
Amy E. Blanchard, purveyor of pleasant and innocuous 
tales for the young, finds a congenial theme in "A 
Sweet Little Maid " (Jacobs), who is as sweet as any 
small child may lawfully be: almost sweeter. "Old 
Father Gander; or, The Better Half of Mother Goose " 
(Page) is a book of jingling and rather elderly rhymes 
accompanied by any quantity of pictures in color and 
in black and white. Mr. Walter Scott Howard is the 
person responsible for it all. Of more importance and 
rather different in its appeal, " Little Leather Breeches, 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

and Other Southern Rhymes" (J. F. Taylor & Co.) is a 
collection of original verses, folk lore tales in rhyme, 
negro songs, street cries, and other matter from the other 
side of Mason and Dixon's line. The numerous colored 
pictures are from the hand of the collector and rhyme- 
ster, Mr. Francis P. Wightman. 

No book for the holidays, whether for 
Ola favorites young or old, has more attractiveness than 

The Golden Age," Mr. Maxfield Parrish 
providing most admirable pictures for Mr. Kenneth 
Grahame's delicious text, and Mr. John Lane giving it 
a sumptuous dress worthy of its literary and pictorial 
content. It is a book to be treasured by bibliophiles. As 
a worthy companion to " A Hundred Fables of ^Esop," 
Mr. Percy J. Billinghurst illustrates " A Hundred 
Fables of La Fontaine " (Lane), making a most desir- 
able pair of minor classics. Another reprint, appropri- 
ate for very good children indeed, is Swift's " Gulliver's 
Travels " (Lane), with pictures by Mr. Herbert Cole 
and the text duly bowdlerized. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" Caesar for Beginners," a first Latin book by Mr. 
William T. St. Clair, is published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 

Mr. G. Bernard Shaw's novel, " Cashel Byron's Pro- 
fession," has been published by the Messrs. Brentano 
in a new edition. 

" The Surgeon's Daughter " is imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner as the latest volume of the " Temple " 
edition of Scott's novels. 

A work on "Embroidery," by Mr. W. G. Paulson 
Townsend and others, has recently been published by 
Messrs. Truslove, Hanson, & Comba. 

That diverting little book, Mrs. Hugh Bell's " Conver- 
sational Openings and Endings," has just been brought 
out in a revised edition by Mr. Edward Arnold. 

" Villette," in two volumes, has just been published 
in the handsome library edition of the Bronte novels, 
which the Scribners import for the American market. 

Volume IV. of the " Critical and Miscellaneous Es- 
says " of Carlyle, in the new " Centenary " edition, has 
just been imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

"Mythology," " Law," " Palmistry," and " Dancing," 
are the respective titles of four small manuals for pop- 
ular instruction just issued by the Penn Publishing Co. 

Dr. Guy Carleton Lee is the author of a work on the 
" Principles of Public Speaking," which is published by 
the Messrs. Putnam. It includes a list of subjects for 
debate and a section on parliamentary law. 

Seneca's " Medea " and " The Daughters of Troy," 
put into English blank verse by Miss Ella Isabel Harris, 
and provided with an introductory essay, are published 
in a small volume by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" England in the Nineteenth Century " (Longmans), 
by Mr. C. W. Oman, is a condensed historical manual 
that might fitly be used as a school-book, but may also 
claim the attention of the general reader as a succinct 
summing-up of its subject and period. 

A valuable map of the seat of war in Africa, thirty- 
two by forty-six inches in size, accompanies the " Na- 
tional Geographic Magazine" (Washington, D. C.) for 
December. The map shows in detail the mountain 



roads, railroads, telegraph lines, stations, and all phys- 
ical features necessary to a clear understanding of the 
country in which the British and Boers are at present 
fighting, and as the map was prepared under the super- 
vision of the War Department, its official nature guar- 
antees the correctness of the details. 

" The Mirror of Perfection," the oldest life of St. 
Francis of Assissi, discovered by M. Paul Sabatier and 
by him edited in the original Latin, has now been put 
into English by Mr. Sebastian Evans, and published by 
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. It makes a very pretty book. 

The " Syllabus of a Course of Eighty-seven Lectures 
on Modern European History" (Macmillan), prepared 
primarily for the use of his students by Professor H. 
Morse Stephens, is a volume of much usefulness to 
teachers of history, and embodies the experience gained 
by five years of work in Cornell University. 

The latest publications, in fiction, issued by Mr. 
Drexel Biddle, Philadelphia, include " Giles Ingilby " 
by W. E. Norris, " La Strega " by Ouida, " An Atlantic 
Tragedy" by Clark Russell, " Zuleka " by Clinton 
Ross, " Strong as Death " by Guy de Maupassant, " The 
Laurel Walk " by Mrs. Molesworth, and " The Money 
Market " by E. F. Benson. 

Volume II. of Professor Alfred Gudeman's " Latin 
Literature of the Empire " (Harper) includes selections 
from the poets, a dozen or more, Juvenal, Lucan, Sen- 
eca, Statius, Claudianus, and Silius Italicus being rep- 
resented by something like forty pages each. It is a 
useful anthology, for students do hot often get hold of 
some of the poets represented. 

President Hadley of Yale will deliver an address on 
" Economic Theory and Political Morality " at the 
opening of the annual meeting of the American Eco- 
nomic Association, at Cornell University, December 27. 
The programme of papers and discussions is one of un- 
usual interest, the problems of Trusts and Combinations 
occupying especial prominence. 

A " Catalogue of the Best Books " in all departments 
of literature is issued by The Burrows Brothers Com- 
pany of Cleveland. The titles are properly classified in 
departments, and the triple index entries by author, 
subject, and title make everything instantly accessible. 
The volume has four hundred pages, well printed, and 
is a very creditable bibliographical production. 

Professor William Macdonald's "Select Charters and 
other Documents Illustrative of American History " 
(Macmillan) covers the pre-Revolutionary period, and 
places within the hands of the student a great mass of 
material not easily accessible otherwise. It affords 
another indication of the praiseworthy tendency, so con- 
spicuous of late in our educational literature, to bring; 
original documents to the hands of our teachers. 

Mr. Henry S. Pancoast's "Standard English Poems" 
(Holt) is a compilation intended for school use in connec- 
tion with any text-book of the history of ourliterature^ 
although, of course, prepared with special reference to 
the author's own excellent manual of the subject. The 
selections range from " Chevy Chase " to Mr. Kipling's 
" Recessional," which latter is the only example given 
from any poet now living. The book has seven hun- 
dred and fifty pages, of which about two hundred are 
notes and other editorial matter. 

The Bibliographical Society of Chicago was organized 
on the evening of Dec. 8, at a meeting held in the 
Public Library rooms. Its membership comprises rep-

sity and other educational institutions, of the publishing 
interests, and of the general book-loving element . 
public. It is a national rather than a local association 
in scope, baring the field to itself as far as the United 
States is concerned. The aims of the Society are stated 
as follows: 1, to encourage and promote bibliographical 
study and research; 2, to compile and publish special 
bibliographies; and, 3, to arouse interest in the history 
of books and libraries. 

Mr. William S. Lord some months ago asked two 
hundred representative literary people " to send him 
lists of twenty-five of the best short poems in nine- 
teenth century English literature. The poems receiving 
the highest numbers of votes are now printed in a neat 
booklet entitled "The Best Short Poems of the Nine- 
teenth Century" (Revell). They are beaded by "The 
Chambered Nautilus," and footed by Wordsworth's 
" Daffodils." It goes without saying that they are all 
good poems, and also that they are not the best. That 
is, they are the favorites of intelligent readers, not the 
masterpieces recognized by authoritative critics. Ten- 
nyson has four of the number, Wordsworth three, and 
fifteen other poets one or two each. 

The publishing and bookselling fraternity, and the 
book world generally, will learn with regret of the de- 
struction by fire of the large establishment of the J. B. 
Lippincott Company of Philadelphia, one of the oldest 
and best equipped houses in the country. Although the 
loss of stock was complete, most of the plates of the 
standard works published by the house were found to 
be uninjured, and the presses and binderies of the city 
were at once set at work in producing new editions, so 
that orders can shortly be filled as before. With praise- 
worthy enterprise the firm at once secured new quarters 
and began the construction of a new building, which, 
with new and complete machinery and equipment, may 
be expected to place the house in a more advantageous 
position than it before enjoyed. 

" The International Monthly," further described as 
41 a magazine of contemporary thought," is to be launched 
by the Messrs. Macmillan on the first of next month. 
It is to be edited by Mr. Frederick A. Richardson, with 
the assistance of an advisory board made up of twelve 
distinct committees, having in their special charge the 
twelve departments of history, philosophy, psychology, 
sociology, comparative religion, literature, fine art, biol- 
ogy, medicine, geology, physics, and industrial art. 
Each committee is supposed to include an American, an 
Englishman, a Frenchman, and a German. Thus the 
department of literature is under the direction of Pro- 
fessor W. P. Trent, Dr. Richard Garnett, M. Gustave 
Lanson, and Professor Alois Brandl. These names cer- 
tainly inspire confidence, and are fairly typical of the 
sort of scholarship enlisted for the entire enterprise. 
Not less than five essays will be included in each num- 
ber of the journal, and these essays will be given suf- 
ficient space to permit their respective subjects to be 
treated seriously, if not exhaustively. In fact, it looks 
as if we were now to have for the first time in this 
country a review in which writers may express them- 
selves at such length as to make it really worth their 
while. We understand that it is the plan of the man- 
agement to select such subjects as may be dealt with 
instructively from the standpoints of the four nations, 
and to assign each subject of this sort to an American, 
an English, a French, and a German writer for treat- 
ment. The plan is a praiseworthy one, and should re- 
sult in some valuable comparative studies.

The first part of tbia work, under the title of " A Quaker Experiment in Government," was published in the 
Spring of 1898, and met a warm reception from press and public, and a ready sale. It carried the narrative 
from the founding of the Commonwealth down to the year 1766, when the conflict between the peace principles 
of the Quakers and the warlike trend of events first reached a crisis. The present volume traces the same conflict 
through the stormy events of the Revolution, and examines its momentous results.

A REMARKABLE RECORD 

The regular edition of the Fifth Annual Book Number of THE 
CHICAGO EVENING POST was unusually large, and judging from all pre- 
vious experiences, sufficient for even extraordinary demands. 

SECOND EDITION NECESSARY . 

The orders for it, however, have continued to come in such quantities that 
it has been necessary to print a second large edition. 

This is probably the first instance on record of a special edition of a 
daily newspaper being of such permanent value that it continues to be 
ordered weeks after its publication. It proves, too, the esteem in which it is 
held in Chicago and the Northwest, where its readers select their Christmas 
gifts from the reviews and publishers' announcements which appear in its 
columns. 

THE CHICAGO EVENING POST 

Will print illustrated reviews of books every Wednesday and Saturday 
until Christmas.
