TO 

THE END OF 

THE TRAIL 

By 
Frank Le-wis Nason 

81.50 



Mrs. Wiggin delights her many re&ders with a 
charming tale of an American girl who rang away 
from her lover and masquerades as a goose girl 
in a qoaint Sussex Tillage. The author's hnmor 
and fanej have free range, as, with the heroine, 
she tends the hens, ducks, and geese of Thorny- 
croft farm and wanders through the picturesque 
village. Mr. Claude A. Sheppersoo has drawn 
fifty-four illustrations which add much to the 
attiactireness of the book. 

In view of the recent death of Bret Harte 
added interest is aroused in his new book which 
has just been published. " Openings in the Old 
Trail " contains nine tales of life in the West, 
told with all of Mr. Harte's skill and charm. 

A new story by Mrs. Foote is always welcome, 
and she has never written a better one than ■* The 
Desert and the Sown." The scene shifts between 
the far West and the Dutch farming country of 
New York; the characters are of imusual interest 
and the story altogether entertaining. 

Among the fiction by new authors none is more 
realistic and keenly interesting than Frank Lewis 
Naaon's novel entitled, " To the End of the Trail." 
Ita seene is laid in the West, and the whole story 
breathes the space and freedom of Colorado ranch 
and mining life. 

« Audrey " has received the highest praise from 
critics as being a lovely and worthy story, showing 
Miss Johnston's power as a writer. The book 
has six colored illustrations. 

In a review of Mr. Sage's new novel, the Bo$Um 
Trantcript says: " ' The Clay homes ' is an inter- 
esting and strong story involving the events and 
the people of stirring time — a living force in 
current literature." 

In " John Kenadie " Mr. Saunders has found a 
field in Arkansas — one new to novelists — and 
has written a story which shows a practised hand 
and thorough knowledge of Arkansas typ>es and 
scenes. It is a strong character study of the hero 
and bis strange and perplexing inheritance. 

A story of striking originality is "Roman 
Biznet " by Georgia Wood Pangborn. The author 
keeps the reader's interest on the alert and tells 
her storv with much skill.

APPLETONS' NEW BOOKS 



The Way of Escape 

A Novel. By GRAHAM TR AVERS (Margaret Todd, M.D.), author of 
"Mona Maclean," " Windyhaugh," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

THE distinction inherent in the books of Graham Travers is peculiarly 
characteristic of her new novel, which shows a largeness of design and 
nobility of purpose that will leave a deep impression. The author deals with a 
question which is answered very differently in " The Silence of Dean Maitland." 
The story, unfolded with all the author's insight into a woman's nature and with 
profound sympathy and unfailing force and interest, is one which will lay strong 
hold upon thinking readers. A novel so elevated, stimulating, and powerful in 
its character will be welcomed as a relief from much current trashy and inconse- 
quential story-telling. 



FIRST VOLUME IN APPLETONS' 
LIFE HISTORIES. 

Father Marquette 

The Explorer of the Mississippi. 

By Reuben G. Thwaites, editor of " The Jesuit 
Relations," etc. Illustrated, 12mo, cloth, $1 net; 
postage, 10 cts. additional. 

Mr. Thwaites, the editor of " The Jesuit Relations," 
whose knowledge of the French on this continent is un- 
surpassed, presents in this volome the story of the gfreat 
explorer in a form having all the interest of a tale of ad- 
venture. Building up from Marquette's own writings and 
those of his contemporaries, he has produced a work that 
will be valuable for its historical accuracy, and peculiarly 
timely in view of the coming celebration of the Louisiana 
Purchase. 

Prisoners of Russia 

By Dr. Benjamin Howard. With an introduction 
by General O. O. Howard. Illustrated, 12mo, 
cloth, $1.40 net; postage, 14 cts. additional. 
A most important contribution to the subject of pen- 
ology. A significant value attaches to the author's 
personal account of Russian convict life at Sakhalin, 
Dr. Howard enjoyed every opportunity for an intimate 
acquaintance with the personnel of the Sakhalin settle- 
ment, and his book pictures many onrions experiences and 
strange characters. 



The History of the 

Louisiana Purchase 

By Dp. James K. Hosmer, author of " A Short 
History of the Mississippi Valley," etc. With 
illustrations and maps. 12mo, cloth, $1.20 net; 
postage, 12 cts. additional. 

The story that Dr. Hosmer tells of the acquisition of 
the western empire included in the Xjouisiana Purchase 
presents fresh and picturesque phases of a most important 
historical event of peculiar and timely interest, in view of 
the anniversary which comes next year. He pictures the 
vague and curious ideas of the Louisiana country held by 
most Americans one hundred years ago, and the objections 
to this form of expansion. He treats the changes in the 
ownership of the territory from France to Spain, and again 
to France, and he develops fully the purposes and acts of 
Jefferson and the American Commissioners in Paris.

Seldom it is that a book other than fiction gets into the

Spencer's " Facts and Comments " belongs this distinc- 
tion, ranking fifth in the list. This book went through

AS TO DRAMATIZATIONS. 

In its etymological sense, dramatization is 
the process of making a drama out of any grist 
that comes to mill, — be it an original idea or 
a second-hand fiction, an actual incident, a 
poem, a name, or a theory. But recently the 
popular conception has reduced it from a generic 
to a specific term, and it is accepted to mean 
almost exclusively the process by which the 
story of a novel is recast into the form of a 
drama. In this sense it has displayed the fer- 
tility of alfalfa. Truthfully might the mer- 



cenary dramatic epigrammatist exclaim, " Let 
me make the dramatizations for the stage, and 
I care not who makes its dramas." 

The whole movement has been episodic and 
abnormal ; it has been overdone, and has in- 
vited the inevitable reaction. Nevertheless, 
the dramatization will go on in the normal and 
rational manner which has always characterised 
the theatre. There was nothing essentially 
original behind the recent ascendancy of the 
dramatization idea. It was an accident of 
group movements. 

Dramas which have been based on original 
fundamental ideas with purely imaginary 
groups of characters have rarely been in the 
majority. Literature has always been the store- 
house of dramatic material, the reserve force of 
the dramatist. Nearly all of Shakespeare's 
plays are dramatizations, in part of novels and 
tales, and in part of history. The playwrights 
succeeding him nearly always drew on concrete 
historical material for the inspiration and form 
of their work. If dramatizations of novels 
were fewer in the eighteenth century than sub- 
sequently, it is in a measure because works of 
fiction were rarer ; the printing-press had not 
developed its enormous potentiality. Novels 
and dramatizations have continually expressed 
their plenitude in their proportions. 

From the earliest decade of the nineteenth 
century the dramatic hack laid violent hands 
on the library. Scott was a ready victim. 
Nearly every one of his novels transmigrated 
to the stage, each multiplying itself into from 
two to six or more versions. Thackeray's char- 
acters were less readily appropriated ; bnt 
Becky Sharp, the Warrington boys, Henry and 
Beatrice, were early paraded before the foot- 
lights, — seldom successfully, because the sub- 
tleties and literalism of Thackeray offered no 
purchase for the attack of the opportunist. 
Dickens has, from the appearance of " Oliver 
Twist," been almost as familiar in the play- 
house as in the library. The appearance of 
each of his works, and of Scott's, precipitated 
a scramble for dramatization beside which the 
phenomenon of the past eight years has not 
been comparable. Many of the stories appeared 
on the stage in dramatic form within two days 
after the books were published. In one in- 



6 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



stance, Dickens found his story dramatized 
and acted before it had run its serial course in 
a periodical. The dramatist had invented an 
ending regardless of the novelist's intention. 
The theatres of New York played five different 
versions of " David Copperfield " the year of 
its appearance. Not so large a proportion of 
Bulwer Lytton's works as of Scott's and 
Dickens's have reached the stage ; but such as 
have found their way thither have established 
an almost equal popularity and permanency. 
Dramatizations were made of a number of 
Cooper's tales, of two of Harriet Beecher 
Stowe's, one of Hawthorne's, two of Wash- 
ington Irving's, and of several of Wilkie Col- 
lins's and Charles Keade's, all long before the 
present renaissance. 

How are we to account for the inundation 
of dramatized novels which has recently swept 
the stage ? There are several reasons which 
may have and no doubt did contribute to the 
fact, but none so much as that to be found in 
the literary movement of the period. With 
the recent flood of romance came the wake of 
dramatizations. At no other time have story 
writers appeared, saving Scott and Dickens, 
who displayed material so inviting and con- 
genial to the playwright. They are writing 
stories of intrigue, of incident, and of action. 
Commercialism has played its part. When 
the publishers herald the declaration that five 
hundred thousand copies of a certain book have 
been sold, it requires no originalist to foresee 
a ready-made trade-mark, a fertilized interest 
for a dramatization of that story. This much 
of the sin is on the soul of the perpetrator of 
that soul-less schedule of " best selling books." 

Though many sins have been committed in 
the name of this worthy process, it is a little- 
appreciated fact that many of the most popular 
and enduring of modern plays — not the best, 
mark you — are dramatizations. When it is 
recalled that the perennial " East Lynne," 
"Kip Van Winkle," "Uncle Tom's Cabin," 
" Camille," and " Monte Cristo," to name only 
five, are in each instance the reconstruction of 
a novel, the group suggests that only dramati- 
zations have perpetuity. 

Dramatizations have revealed terrible and 
wonderful possibilities. The amateur unskilled 
in the technique of playmaking often displays 
a naive surprise at the achievements thereof. 
Before Mr. Booth Tarkington demonstrated 
the practicability of the experiment, many 
people expressed wonderment that Mr. Kichard 
Mansfield was to secure a long play from the 



brief " Monsieur Beaucaire." The experienced 
and successful workman uses only the theme 
of a story, and thereon he embroiders. " Rip 
Van Winkle " is the dramatization of a short 
story ; so is " The Cricket on the Hearth." 
Most of the tangent Shakespearian inspiration 
was the mere pulse of the resultant plays. As 
a record of curiosity, it may be recalled that 
" The Heart of Maryland " was a dramatiza- 
tion of " Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night "; 
and " Shenandoah " bore the same relation to 
" Sheridan's Ride." Sherlock Holmes is the 
dramatization of a character, not of any one of 
Dr. Doyle's stories. p^^^ Wilstach.

Sir Walter Besant's Autobiography,* 

Walter Besant was so accomplished a story- 
teller that he could not fail to relate the story 
of his own life in an attractive way, and his 
Autobiography, which has just been published 
under theeditorialcareofDr.S. Squire Sprigge, 
is a volume of much value and a notable addi- 
tion to a branch of literature in which our own 
language is richer than any other. It would 
be interesting to inquire just why it is that 
biography (including autobiography) occupies 
so large a place, relatively, in English litera- 
ture. Other nations have biographies of their 
greater men, as a matter of course ; but other 
nations do not, as a rule, make so many of 
their lesser men the subjects of substantial 
volumes. We seem in this respect to have 
learned a lesson that has escaped Frenchmen 
and Germans, — the lesson that a man's life is 
the most interesting thing in the world, and 
that the interest of the life is by no means 
strictly proportional to the importance of his 
achievement. If he has done enough to make 
his name reasonably familiar to a wide circle 
of readers, and a competent artist in biography 
is at hand, no other justification is needed for 
recounting his career. Even our fiction assumes 
more frequently, we should fancy, than the 
fiction of other peoples, the form of biography ; 
and every reader can recall many a novel which 
is really nothing more than the story of a single 
life as imagined by the writer. Without at- 
tempting to discuss this question in any detail, 
it may perhaps be set down safely enough, as a

general formala, that the English is the most 
individual of modern races, and that conse- 
qaently the individaal English reader takes a 
peculiar satisfaction in learning how other in- 
dividuals, real or imagined, have dealt with the 
problems that beset every human existence. 

The life of a professional man of letters is 
apt to be barren of external incident or dramatic 
setting, leaving the man who undertakes to 
write it little recourse save to the inner ex- 
perience of the subject as revealed in books, 
journals, correspondence, and familiar inter- 
course. It is, on the whole, best that such a 
life should take the form of autobiography, for 
who but the man who has himself lived it 
could adequately portray the succession of 
moods and intellectual states which has made 
np its substance. So we are glad that " Sir 
Walter the Second " has told us his own life- 
story, instead of leaving the task to some pious 
friend, although another hand might have made 
a good deal out of it, in view of the varied ac- 
tivities that engrossed Sir Walter's busy and 
useful years. His Mauritius experiences, his 
work for the Palestine Exploration Fund, his 
militant efforts in behalf of the profession of 
authorship, his extensive labors in the field of 
London history, and his long career of bene- 
ficent pbilanthopic endeavor, would provide 
enough material for an interesting book, even 
if there were no novels to write about. In- 
deed, Sir Walter was so mnch more than a 
novelist, so much more than a mere man of 
letters, that the story of his books would deal 
with only a single aspect of a remarkably rich 
and many-sided career. It is true that his 
books were what chiefly made him widely fa- 
mous, creating the demand which made a biog- 
raphy possible, but the writing of novels, al- 
though doubtless a delight to him, was regarded 
as a kind of journeyman work, to be conscien- 
tiously performed to the best of his abilities, 
but not to be compared in real importance to 
the work of bestowing added dignity upon the 
literary profession, or of founding a People's 
Palace, or of projecting an Atlantic Union that 
should bind more closely than ever before the 
branches of the English-speaking people. These 
were the real objects of Sir Walter's life, and 
to them novel-writing was ancillary or inci- 
dental. 

The Autobiography was left by Sir Walter 
in an uncompleted state, or at least an unrevised 
one, and his editor, explaining the author's 
methods of work, indicates certain respects in 
which he thinks the book might have been 



modified, had Sir Walter himself seen it through 
the press. We are not qaite sure that we agree 
with the editor in his assumption that the writer 
would have been less outspoken upon certain 
subjects had he lived to revise his first draft. 
He would not wantonly have given offense to 
any soul alive, bnt his early experience in re- 
ligious matters was such that he thought plain 
speaking needful, and he did not conceal his 
abhorrence of the religious view that substitutes 
ceremonial for worship, or of the view that there 
is something sinful in the enjoyment of life and 
letting every human faculty have full play. 
Sir Walter was ever a hater of shams, and he 
had no lack of courage when it was a question 
of exposing hypocrisy and pleading for a ra- 
tional form of religious observance. It is only 
a hopelessly bigoted soul that could take offence 
at such a passage as the following, which voices 
the honest indignation of a generous spirit at 
the perversion of the spirit of Christianity: 

" Wben I consider the extent of the Calvinistie teaeb- 
ing; its dreadful narrowDess; the truly heaitleas tad 
pitiless way in which those solemn faces above the 
wobbling Geneva bands spoke of the small number of 
the Elect and the certainty of endless torment for the 
multitude — the whole illustrating the ineffable Love 
of God — I am amazed that people were as cheerful 
as they were. I suppose that people were accustomed 
to this kind of talk; there was no question of rebellion; 
nobody dared to doubt or disbelieve; only, you see, the 
doctrine if realised would have made life intolerable; 
the human affections only the source and spring of 
agony; religion a selfish, individual, doubtful hope; 
the closing years of old age a horrible anticipation of 
what was to follow. Therefore the thing was put away 
in silence; it was brought out in two sermons every 
week ; it was regarded as a theological exercise in which 
the congregation could admire the intellectual subtle- 
ties by which every gracious word of Christ was, by 
some distortion of half a verse from Paul, tamed into 
the exact opposite of what it meant." 

In spite of his manifest unfitness for the 
ecclesiastical life, Besant was on the point of 
taking orders at the close of his university 
period. He loathed the idea, but it seemed 
the only course open to him. Returning from 
a vacation walking tour in the Tyrol, where 
Calverley had been one of his companions, he 
was met by the direct question as to when he 
wished to be ordained. 

" By this time I had passed the voluntary theological 
examination at Cambridge, and bad nothing more to do 
except to pass the Bi&hop's examination. I put myself 
in communication with the Bishop's secretary, and with 
great depression of spirits prepared myself for perjury, 
because by this time I understood that the white tie 
would choke me. Then I beard that there were rumors 
among the governors. Somebody said that he feared 
— he was told — it was rumored — that I was not 
sound on the Atonement. And day by day the troth 



8 



THE DIAL. 



[July 1, 



was borne in upon me that I was not called and chosen 
for the office of deacon in the Church of England. 
Christmas came. I was to be ordained in the Spring; 
the Bishop had my name; my credentials had been sent 
to him. And then — oh! happiness! a door of release 
was thrown open. My friend Ebden, then a junior in 
the Colonial OfBce, came to see me. In his hand, so 
to speak, he held two colonial professorships. It seemed 
not improbable that I might have either of them if I 
chose. Then I should not have to take orders; then 
I should see something more of the world ; then I should 
travel across the ocean. If I chose ? Of course I chose. 
I jumped at the chance. I sent in my name. I was 
appointed. My choice was for the Mauritius, because 
the other place was in South Africa, and I don't like 
snakes. So when I returned to Leamington it was to 
give in my resignation in three months, with the joy of 
feeling that I need not trouble the Bishop of Worcester 

to whom I forgot to send an excuse — and that no 

one thenceforward would so much as ask whether I was 
sound on the Atonement." 

Thus did Besant reacli the critical point in 
his career, and thus was the course of his 
future determined. He did not know — few 
of us do know at such times — how momentous 
was the decision thus taken. It was only in 
after years, looking back to his early manhood, 
that he could realize all that it meant. 

"Though I could not suspect the fact, I was about 
to equip myself — with travel, with the society of all 
kinds of men, with the acquisition of things practical 
. — for the real solid work of my life, which has been 
the observation of men and women, and the telling of 
stories about them." 

The Mauritius appointment was as professor 
of mathematics ; the engagement lasted for six 
years, when Besant returned to England, at 
the age of thirty-one. He had been making 
special studies in French literature, and his 
next piece of work was to put together the 
essays that made up his book on " Early French 
Poetry." The publication of this book gave 
him literary standing, and his pen was engaged 
by various editors from this time on. The 
year of its publication also brought him a piece 
of good luck in his appointment to the post of 
paid secretary to the Palestine Exploration 
Fund. For eighteen years he occupied this 
post, which gave him a modest but sure in- 
come, and left him much time for literary work. 
During this time he was connected ofBcially 
with two matters that made much stir in the 
learned world. One was the discovery of the 
Moabite Stone, the other was the Deuteronomy 
forgery of Shapira. His friendship with E. H. 
Palmer naturally belongs to this part of his 
life, a friendship which resulted, after Palmer's 
dramatictaking-off, in one of the most charming 
biographies in our language. 

Besant's first attempt at novel-writing dates 



from the Mauritius years, and this is the 
author's humorous account of the venture : 

" I also wrote a novel. It was a long novel, intended 
for the then orthodox three volumes. I wrote it with 
great enjoyment, and I persuaded myself that it was 
good. Finally I sent it to England and had it submit- 
ted to a publisher. His verdict was in plain language — 
' Won't do, but has promise.' When I got home I re- 
ceived back the MS., and I agreed with the verdict; it 
was a happy thing for me that the MS. was not pub- 
lished. The papers lay in my chamber for a long time 
afterwards in a corner covered with dust. They got 
upon my nerves. I used to see a goblin sitting on the 
pile; an amorphous goblin, with tearful eyes, big head, 
shapeless body, long arms and short legs. He would 
wag his head mournfully. < Don't make another like 
me,' he said. ' Not like me. I could n't bear to meet 
another like me.' At last I plucked up courage and 
burned the whole pile. Then my goblin vanished and 
I saw him no more. I expected him some time after, 
if only to thank me for not making another like him. 
But he came not, and I have often wondered whither 
that goblin went for rest and consolation." 

Early in Besant's career as a novelist he 
formed his famous partnership with James 
Rice, which lasted for ten years, and resulted 
in as many novels of dual authorship. Of 
these novels, " The Chaplain of the Fleet " is 
the one that he liked best. Of the novels which 
Besant wrote independently, after the death of 
his collaborator, he singles out " Dorothy 
Foster " as the best, " The Fourth Generation " 
as the most serious, and " Children of Gibeon " 
as the most truthful. Altogether, he produced 
eighteen novels in the years between 1882 and 
1900. They made him many friends and many 
enemies. Looking back upon the whole series, 
he gives us this manly and moving statement 
of his attitude toward life and the world of 
men: 

" I think, my work has never yet been gloomy. 
Thank Heaven! I have had less during my life, so far, 
to make me gloomy iu the sixties than falls to the lot 
of many men in the thirties. Let me, in what remains 
of life, preserve cheerfulness, if only the cheerfulness 
of common gratitude. No one ought to acknowledge 
more profoundly than myself the happiness that has 
been bestowed upon me; the domestic peace; the free- 
dom from pecuniary troubles; literary success in a 
measure unhoped-for; a name known all over the 
English-speaking world; and circles of friends. And 
with them a whole army of enemies — exactly such 
enemies as one, at the outset, would desire above all 
things to make; the spiritualistic fraud with his lying 
pretensions and his revelations revealing nothing from 
the other world; the sickly sentimentalist blubbering 
over the righteous punishment of the sturdy rogue; and 
the shrieking sisterhood. They are all my enemies, 
and if, at the beginning of life, I had been asked what 
enemies I would make — could I have made a better 
choice?" 

In this nunc dimittis strain the whole nature

The Latest and Last of Mr. Spencer's 
"Writings.* 



Feelings of the most opposite nature remain 
after the reading of Mr. Herbert Spencer's 
volume of " Facts and Comments ": thankful- 
ness that he has been spared so long, sorrow 
that he is to write no more. The little preface 
sets forth the reasons for the book. " During 
the years spent in writing various systematic 
works," he says, " there have from time to 
time arisen ideas not fitted for incorporation 
in them." These ideas form the bulk of the 
book, though there is an occasional addendum 
to the " Synthetic Philosophy " also included. 
"Possibly to a second edition I shall make 
some small additions," he concludes, " but, be 
this as it may, the volume herewith issued I 
can say with certainty will be my last." And 
a fitting end it makes to a great work greatly 
conceived and greatly done. 

There are thirty-nine brief essays in " Facts 
and Comments," — much briefer, on an aver- 
age, than the papers included in the earlier 
volumes like " Illustrations of Universal Pro- 
gress" and " Essays, Moral, Political, and Es- 
thetic." The widest range is given, making 
the work in general effect a sort of exalted 
scrap-book. The volume of " Various Frag- 
ments " is also suggested by the treatment 
accorded the topics here. The commercial 
world, imperialism vs. righteousness, music 
and literature, art in general, education, lin- 
guistics, psychology, meteorology, gymnastics 
and hygiene, the science of history, religion in 
the broad and undogmatic sense, personal rem- 
iniscence, and much more of a similar nature, 
will indicate the philosopher's scope.

To say that everything included falls within 
Huxley's admirable definition of science as 
" organized common-sense " is to be expected. 
Many of the statements come home with the 
force of truisms, yet not one is to be passed 
lightly by. Who can deny, for example, the 
crying need for such thought as this ? 

" I detest that conception of social progress which 
presents as its aim, increase of population, growth of 
wealth, spread of commerce. In the politico-economic 
ideal of human existence there is contemplated quan- 
tity onlv and not quality. Instead of an immense 
amount of life of low type I would far sooner see half 
the amount of life of high type. A prosperity which is 
exhibited in Board-of-Trade tables, year by year in- 
creasing their totals, is to a large extent not a pros- 
perity, but an adversity. Increase in the swarms of 
people whose existence is subordinated to material de- 
velopment is rather to be lamented than to be rejoiced 
over." 

This same thought is expanded in another 
direction in the article on " State Education." 
As an evolutionist, Mr. Spencer regards the 
imposition of the book learning of the com- 
mon schools, — " education artificially pressed 
forward," in his apt phrase, — upon the lower 
classes of Great Britain, as revolutionary and 
causative of great and untoward disturbances 
in the social state. From the ability to read 
being fostered when the ability to think is still 
undeveloped, he argues the growth of imperial- 
ism, the rise and masterfulness of "yellow 
journalism," and a number of other evil things. 
So far as he deals with the sort of education 
given commonly in state-supported schools, he 
seems to be at one here with Dr. John Dewey 
and Miss Jane Addams, who, however, express 
themselves as holding that the evils complained 
of grow out of mistakes in the school curricula 
rather than in education itself. Mr. Walter 
H. Page, in a lately published volume, seeks 
to identify training and education ; and it is 
here that the fault probably lies and the rem- 
edy is to be found. Too much book learning 
and too little training are doubtless at the bot- 
tom of, the trouble, and the disposition of the 
British as well as the American people to wan- 
der away from paths of common-sense in poli- 
tics may better be laid to lack of training — 
i. e., to improper education — rather than to 
education as such. 

There are two interesting chapters on 
" Style," extensions of the well-known essay 
of Mr. Spencer's youth. The first of the two 
is given up to criticism of the phrasing of cer- 
tain extracts from the stylists, Matthew Arnold 
and Francis Palgrave among them, in disproof 
of " the current belief that a good style implies 



10 



THE DIAL

linguistic culture — implies classical education 
and study of the best models," and counter- 
proof that " the great mass of those who have 
had the discipline of a university do not write 
well." The second of these chapters is a sort 
of criticism of the author's own essay of an 
earlier day, in which he openly confesses that 
he has not followed his own precepts, and finds 
his writings obnoxious to his own strictures. 
He says in this connection : 

" From moment to moment such words and forms of 
expression as habit had made natural to me were used 
without thought of their conformity or nonconformity 
to the principles I had espoused. Occasionally, indeed, 
when revising a manuscript or a proof, one of these 
principles has been recalled and has dictated the sub- 
stitution of a word, or the search for a brief phrase to 
replace a long one. But the effect has been extremely 
small. The general traits of my style have remained 
unchanged, notwithstanding my wish to change some 
of them. There is substantial truth in the French say- 
ing. Varying it somewhat, we may say : Style is or- 
ganic. Doubtless organization may be modified, but 
the function, like the structure, retains its fundamental 
characters." 

Another interesting question, and one of 
more importance to contemporaneous literature 
than is at first apparent, is discussed thus : 

" Up to 1860 my books and review articles were 
written. Since then they have all been dictated. There 
is a prevailing belief that dictation is apt to cause dif- 
fuseness, and I think the belief is well founded. It 
was once remarked to me by two good judges — the 
Leweses — that the style of Social Statics is better 
than the style of my later works, and, assuming this 
opinion to be true, the contrast may, I think, be as- 
cribed to the deteriorating effect of dictation. A recent 
experience strengthens me in this conclusion. When 
finally revising First Principles, which was dictated, the 
cutting out of superfluous words, clauses, sentences, 
and sometimes paragraphs, had the effect of abridging 
the work by fifty pages — about one-tenth." 

One of the most interesting papers in the 
book is that on " Feeling versus Intellect." 
Beginning with an anecdote of Professor Hux- 
ley concerning the unexpectedly large brain of 
the porpoise, Mr. Spencer goes on to show that 
this brain capacity, " seemingly out of all re- 
lation to the creature's needs," is due to the 
unusual amount of feeling which it manifests, 
and then goes on to discuss a popular and 
egregious error. 

" There has grown up universally an identification of 
mind with intelligence. Partly because the guidance 
of our actions by thought is so conspicuous, and partly 
because speech, which occupies so large a space in our 
lives, is a vehicle that makes thought predominant to 
ourselves and others, we are led to suppose that the 
thought element of mind is its chief element ; an ele- 
ment often excluding from recognition every other. 
Consequently, when it is said that the brain is the 
organ of the mind, it is assumed that the brain is 
chiefly if not wholly the organ of the intellect. 



« The error is an enormous one. The chief compo- 
nent of mind is feeling. To see this it is necessary to 
get rid of the wrong connotations which the word mind 
has acquired, and to use instead its equivalent — con- 
sciousness. Mind properly interpreted is coextensive 
with consciousness; all parts of consciousness are parts 
of mind. Sensations and emotions are parts of con- 
sciousness, and so far from being its minor components 
they are its major components." 

Here, perhaps, is to be found the reason for 
the decay of pure poetry — which is primarily 
feeling — in popular estimation, and the sub- 
stitution for it of didactic verse among many 
persons whose intellect has been developed at 
the expense of their emotions. But this is as 
nothing compared to the further effects of doc- 
trine, as eloquently set forth by Mr. Spencer 
in the following paragraph : 

" An over- valuation of teaching is necessarily a con- 
comitant of this erroneous interpretation of mind. 
Everywhere the cry is — Educate, educate, educate! 
Everywhere the belief is that by such culture as schools 
furnish, children, and therefore adults, can be moulded 
into the desired shapes. It is assumed that when men 
are taught what is right, they will do what is right — 
that a proposition intellectually accepted will be morally 
operative. And yet this conviction, contradicted by 
every-day experience, is at variance with an every-day 

axiom the axiom that each faculty is strengthened by 

exercise of it — intellectual power by intellectual action, 
and moral power by moral action. The current notion 
is that these causes and effects can be transposed — 
that assent to an injunction will be followed by exercise 
of the correlative feeling. ... It seems, however, that 
this unlimited faith in teaching is not to be changed by 
facts. Though in presence of multitudinous schools, 
high and low, we have the rowdies and Hooligans, the 
savage disturbers of meetings, the adulterators of food, 
the givers of bribes and receivers of corrupt commis- 
sions, the fraudulent solicitors, the bubble companies, 
yet the current belief continues unweakened; and re- 
cently in America an outcry respecting the yearly in- 
crease of crime was joined with an avowed determina- 
tion not to draw any inferences adverse to their educa- 
tional system. But the refusal to recognize the futility 
of mere instruction as a means to moralization is most 
strikingly shown by ignoring the conspicuous fact that 
after two thousand years of Christian exhortations, 
uttered by a hundred thousand priests throughout Eu- 
rope, pagan ideas and sentiments remain rampant, from 
emperors down to tramps. Principles admitted in 
theory are scorned in practice. Forgiveness is voted 
dishonorable. An insult must be wiped out by blood: 
the obligation being so peremptory that an officer is 
expelled from the army for even daring to question it. 
And in international affairs the sacred duty of revenge, 
supreme with the savage, is supreme also with the so- 
called civilized." 

If space availed, it would be worth while 
showing the amplification of this last idea in 
the treatment of such cries as that attributed 
to Stephen Decatur, Jr., " My country, right 
or wrong ! " It would certainly be profitable 
to show the connection noted in the title of the

paper on " Imperialism and Slavery." In 
other fields, the general disregard of the part 
played by the individual in the development of 
world-resources by socialists and coUectivists 
generally deserves consideration. And so does 
the general conclusion arrived at in respect of 
art, that its function as an amusement is suffi- 
cient justification for its existence. 

Generally speaking, the book shows the 
same openness and receptivity to new impres- 
sions that have been so marked a part of Mr. 
Spencer's mental equipment throughout his 
career as a philosopher, and with this a devel- 
opment of feeling for right and a refusal to be 
governed bv opportunity rather than principle 
as welcome as they are rare.

A Short Histort of Germaxt,* 



In 1894, when Mr. Ernest F. Henderson 
wrote the prefa«.^e to his " History of Germany 
in the Middle Ages," he appended a note to 
the effect that he intended that volume " to be 
the precursor of two others covering the whole 
of German history." That intention is now 
realized, and the two handsome volumes of Mr. 
Henderson's '* Short History of Germany ' 
are before us. 

In his preface, the author questions whether 
the usual choice " of the history of France as 
a guiding thread through the intricacies of 
general European history " is justifiable. In 
the mediaeval period, he argues, the Empire 
and the Papacy were the great factors ; while 
the larger interests in modern times were the 
Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, the 
men whose work has proved permanent were 
Frederick the Great and William I. It is 
therefore a fair inference that he offers his 
treatment of German history as furnishing this 
labyrinthine clue, which every student certainly 
needs ; and from this point of view a few words 
are in order. 

First, as to the general plan. Apparently, 
since the earlier work extended to the end of 
the great inter-regnum, the new history gives 
only a rapid survey of that period, devoting to 
it only a hundred and twenty pages, while the 
remainder of the first volume — some three 
hundred and seventy pages — brings the nar- 
rative down to the Peace of Westphalia. The 
second volume continues it to the close of the 

•A Shobt History or GKKiiAjrr. By Ernest F. Hen- 
denon. Ib tiro Tolomea. Xew York : The Mscmillan Co. 



Franco-Prussian War. Snch a division, espe- 
cially the extremely brief treatment of me- 
diaeval Germany, is not to be commended. 
It may have seemed unnecessary to Mr. Hen- 
derson to devote much space to ground covered 
more fully in his earlier volume ; but as that 
work is not mentioned as introductory to this, 
he seems to have committed, in a different 
way. the error he urges against German writers 
of presupposing " more knowledge than is usu- 
ally to be found in American readers." Due 
regard for symmetry might well have dictated 
a fuller treatment of the formation of German 
institutions : otherwise the title should have 
shown that the book dealt chiefly with modem 
times. So, too, a better sense of proportion 
woald have forbidden so brief a mention of the 
attempts made under Maximilian to reform the 
constitution at the end of the fifteenth century, 
while the Landsknechts are described at some 
length. So important a fact as the introduc- 
tion of the Roman law is simply touched upon ; 
its far-reaching and permanent consequences 
are not emphasized as they deserve. 

The first impression made by the book is, 
however, its readableness. Mr. Henderson's 
style is generally clear, although now and then 
ambiguous sentences or annoying mannerisms, 
especially in the use of pronouns, are to be 
noted. Thus, the sentence (Vol. XL, p. 106), 
" It proved ... a phantom that Frederick 
William was chasing ; the last of the Pfalz- 
Neuburgers outlived himself, and his son," 
etc The author intends to say that the King 
did not live to see the extinction of the male 
line in the house in question : though that is 
hardly made clear by his syntax. But snch 
quibbles aside, it may be said that the interest 
of the book is extraordinarily well sustained. 
In the portrayal of single dramatic incidents, 
of remarkable scenes, the author is not only 
at his best, but shows real power. An excel- 
lent illustration of this is the account of the 
corpses displayed to Frederick William in his 
castle-vard after the barricade fights at Berlin 
in 1848. 

But this very effort at striking description 
becomes at times a source of weakness, leading 
as it does to a collocation of facts, perfectly 
correct in themselves but easily suggesting an 
inaccurate or incorrect inference. Thus, the 
remains of the lake-dwellers and those at Hall- 
statt are spoken of as if they were the earliest 
sources of knowledge regarding the Germans. 
The probability is that in the latter case the 
remains are Celtic ; while, as far as the former 



12 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



are concerned, lake-dwellings have been found 
in so many parts of Europe, as well as in abo- 
riginal America, that no valid conclusions re- 
garding distinctively German civilization can 
be drawn. But a more important case in point 
is found in the pages on Luther's disputation 
at Leipzig. Mr. Henderson relates how the 
great Reformer once came upon a book by 
Huss, and, slamming it to, thrust it away as 
a thing of evil ; he follows this at once by the 
statement that Luther was now "forced to 
acknowledge . . . that many of these teach- 
ings were right christian and evangelical." 
Now both statements are true, but the natural 
inference that the two acts followed close upon 
each other is not correct. Luther had come 
gradually to see that he must admit that Huss 
was in many points right ; he made, however, 
no sudden change of base. Instances of a simi- 
lar nature might easily be multiplied ; but the 
one is enough to suggest what seems perhaps 
the greatest defect in the work — the lack of 
careful analysis of causes and of characters. 
Individuals stand out in bold outline, but in a 
man like Luther the development of his opin- 
ions is a matter of the greatest importance. 
What we have is the distinctness of a " snap- 
shot " rather than the life-like reality of a 
portrait which suggests the struggles that ma- 
tured the man. 

In another respect the book is distinctly 
disappointing, — in the little space devoted to 
the Culturgeschichte of the German people. 
The chapter on the Age of Chivalry, for ex- 
ample, contains an array of facts regarding the 
life of various classes ; but the expression of 
that life in the great epics of the day is quite 
inadequately treated. Excepting a page or 
two in Parzival, the literature of the period is 
hardly mentioned. The Nibelungenlied is not 
named, nor are the great court epics and the 
Minnesingers discussed. More satisfactory are 
the pages on the intellectual conditions at the 
beginning of the Reformation, particularly the 
paragraphs on the " Letters of Obscure Men"; 
but the literary significance of Luther's trans- 
lation of the Bible is only incidentally touched 
upon, and its national importance, in preserving 
a common idiom for north and south Germany, 
is entirely passed over. So, too, even the 
names of Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller do not 
occur in the index to the second volume. It 
would seem, indeed, that the title of the work 
ought to contain a qualifying adjective and 
read, " A Short Political History of Germany." 

It was doubtless not intended by the author, 



but to some, at least, of the newspaper para- 
graphers, the title of the book has suggested a 
comparision with Green's " Short History of 
the English People." Such a comparison is 
unfortunate, for it only tends to emphasize 
" what might have been." The student who 
gets his introduction to English history from 
Green may need to supplement his knowledge 
with a summary of political events, but he gets 
a grasp of the fundamental causes, a clear 
picture of the growth of a mighty nation, a 
broad background for understanding its na- 
tional life as expressed in English literature of 
the past and present. All this is lacking in Mr. 
Henderson's book. He gives the political out- 
line, the facts as they are stated and accepted 
by the most scholarly modern authorities. 
What he does not give us is the growth of in- 
dividuals, the development of society with all 
its shifting and changing elements which give 
to each age its peculiar character. But of his- 
torians like Green there have been few ; nor 
does the training of German universities con- 
tribute largely to their making. Mr. Hender- 
son has, however, given us an excellent, read- 
able, and trustworthy account of the course of 
political events in Germany, — the best in the 
English language, and one that deserves and 
will have a place in every library and on the 
shelves of every student who is interested in 
the story of the Fatherland.

The Basis of Social, Relations.* 



It is pleasing to note the increasing interest 
in anthropological study in America, where the 
subject is rapidly taking its place in the uni- 
versities as an independent scientific branch. 
The persistent and valuable work of the Bureau 
of Ethnology furnishes a foundation for this, 
and gives inspiration to instructors and investi- 
gators. America is the true home of the sci- 
ence of Ethnology, an important branch of 
anthropological study. It is naturally to be 
expected, therefore, that our universities and 
colleges should include this subject in their cur- 
ricula, not only as an independent culture study 
but also as a necessary support to more widely 
extended studies in Sociology. 

The well-known contributions to Anthro- 
pology made by the late Dr. Daniel G. Brin- 
ton have received another addition in this

recent posthumous work on " The Basis of 
Social Relations." Dr. Brinton's services to 
the science of Anthropology need no commen- 
dation. The present work, however, does not 
show him at his best. The book contains many 
interesting chapters more or less disconnected, 
as if it were the first draft of the book, or at 
least as if the work had not yet received the 
finishing touches from the author's pen. While 
it contains much useful information, and is 
suggestive of many unique and striking char- 
acteristics of the nature of groups of individ- 
uals, it is somewhat wanting in unity and sci- 
entific poise. 

Part I. treats of the cultural history of the 
ethnic mind, in which the author proceeds to 
urge the unitv of the human mind and then to 
show that there is an ethnic mind to which the 
individnal mind bears a specific relation. He 
demonstrates quite conclusively the universal- 
ity of mental characteristics, and in the very 
interesting discussion following he seeks to 
show that there is a true ethnic mind, a trans- 
cendent ego beyond the individual and over 
which the individual has no control. In order 
to do this he has enlarged the conception of 
"ethnic," making it represent any group of 
people closely related by social environment, 
— which, from the standpoint of an anthro- 
pologist, is an unfair assumption. Race, from 
a scientific standpoint, certainly refers to per- 
manent stock, and indeed Ls something more 
than consanguineal relations. Hence it is much 
more limited than common social relations. In 
other words, the author has substituted sociu^ 
for ethnos, and has passed from the field of 
Anthropology into the field of pure Sociology. 
While he assumes that there is a distinct eth- 
nic mind, he has not demonstrated that there 
is anything more than conscious thinking, feel- 
ing, and willing together of the so-called ethnic 
group. What he presents is interesting, but it 
is better presented by the sociologists through 
a study of the socisd mind; for, indeed, our 
author is forced to leave the ethnic basis for 
the social basis. 

The chapter on the physiological variation 
in the ethnic mind is especially thoughtful and 
interesting, presenting as it does ideals or types, 
and the general conformity of the ethnic group 
to customs, habits, and thoughts. Also in the 
second part, which treats of the natural his- 
tory of the ethnic mind, the chapters on social 
and geographical environment show the results 
of close observation. In the former the author 
holds with some force " that ethnic psychology, 



I the group-mind, is a product of social relations, 
; a result of aggregation, and cannot be fully 
I explained by the process of the individual 
j mind. The resemblances between them are 
analogies, not homologies. They act and re- 
act on one another with a force of independent 
psychic entities." He endeavors to show the 
influence of the ethnic mind on the individual, 
" to bring it in rapport with itself, to make it 
conform to the mass, to expunge, in fact, all 
that is individual within it." But the argu- 
ment is not conclusive, for the individual mind 
still maintains its independent activity, the 
source of the psychic forces of society. 

While the book is valuable in its suggestive- 
ness in many directions, its main thesis, which 
assumes the independence of the ethnic mind, 
is not conclusively proved : and if it is true that 
ethnic psychology has a place among the exact 
sciences, as the author claims, he has not dem- 
onstrated that fact by the book.

The History and Mystkrt of Lack.* 



One of the most sumptuous books of the 
year is a new edition of Mrs. Bury Palliser's 
" History of Lace," enlarged and partly re- 
written by M. Jonrdain and Alice Dryden. 
By bringing the history up to date and oor- 
rectinff whatever errors modem research has 
discovered, the present editors have retained 
the encyclopaedic character of the information ; 
while by added illustrations, many of them 
full-page plates, they have lent the volume 
something of the value of a cabinet of old lace. 
Indeed, the lover of lace will derive from 
these marvellously delicate photographs a joy 
scarcely inferior to that called forth by real 
Brussels and Mechlin. 

The vast mass of fact in the book is made 
available by a chapter-division according to 
countries, and a fairly orderly history in each 
chapter of the particular kind or kinds of lace 
which the country has produced from early 
times to the present day. The division ac- 
cording to reigns of the parts which deal with 
France and England, cuts across this main plan 
rather confusingly, but perhaps could not have 
been avoided. The most interesting chapters 
are those at the beginning, which trace the de-

velopment of lace — as far as that development 
can be traced — from embroidery and cut- 
work ; and those on Italy, Flanders, Alen^on, 
and Argentan. The work is largely antiqua- 
rian, and the fulness of reference to wardrobe 
rolls, inventories, bills, orders, and letters, not 
to mention plays and poems, shows the spirit 
of research in its most strenuous mood. To 
the ordinary novice in lace, the technical part 
of the work is the least satisfactory ; but if one 
comes to the end without being able always to 
tell bobbin-lace from point-lace, he should 
doubtless blame his own obtuseness, and not 
attribute lack of clearness to the authors. To 
the initiate, Mrs. Palliser's minute technical 
knowledge will be as inspiring as it has been 
in previous editions of her book. 

For most readers, the greatest virtue of the 
book will be found in its incidents rather than 
its main purpose. The most un-lacified critic 
will wonder after reading it, why he never be- 
fore looked at the world from the lace point of 
view. Certainly toward individuals this point of 
view is most gracious. For example, Catherine 
de Medicis appears to unusual advantage teach- 
ing fine needlework to her daughters and to 
Mary of Scotland. Admiral Nelson takes on an 
unaccustomed charm of domesticity when we 
see him buying a lace shawl for his wife. And 
Browning's name has an added endearment 
when we know that he founded a school of lace- 
making for the peasant girls of Asolo. Some 
day a novelist will discover the possibilities of 
a lace background, and give us the romance of 
Barbara Uttman's introduction of lace-making 
into Germany, or of Gustaf Erikson's narrow 
escape from being betrayed by his lace collar. 

Underneath these suggestions of romance 
are those of more serious import. An impor- 
tant chapter in the history of art might be writ- 
ten on the development of lace patterns from 
the geometric designs of Greek lace through 
the architectural period of Italian and French 
lace, and the incidental reign of the " frying- 
pan and turkey-tail patterns " in English 
Honiton, to the prevalence of designs from 
nature. Many chapters of political history are 
involved in the story of this most delicate of 
handicrafts, — the laying and removing of 
protective tariffs, the failing power of kings in 
lace night-caps to keep their subjects from 
wearing lace collars, and even the Revolution 
which followed the time when the daughter of 
Louis XV. spent ,£25,000 for the lace-trimmed 
linen of her trousseau. The church has had a 
large share in the story, having fostered and 



in many cases inaugurated the craft, treasured 
its products when they were out of fashion, and 
also, alas ! having often set the fashion of ex- 
travagant display. Even the Puritans have 
set their characteristic stamp on the industry, 
for it was a fair Puritan of whom Jasper 
Mayne wrote, in the days of King James, — 

" She works religions petticoatB ; for flowers 
She 'U make church histories." 

The deepest industrial problems underlie 
the decay of lace-making, which took place in 
all countries at times varying from the middle 
of the eighteenth to the middle of the nine- 
teenth century. The revival in many places 
has also been due to industrial causes. We 
read that " Irish point owes its genesis to the 
failure of the potato crop in 1846," — an 
association of cause and effect which the ordi- 
nary philosopher would not have suspected. 
In many such times of distress, some philan- 
thropist has searched out one or two old 
women who made lace in their youth, and per- 
suaded them to teach younger fingers the half- 
forgotten stitches. There again is a field for 
romance. At present the problem in lace- 
making, as in all other handicrafts, is how to 
prevent the cheaper machine product from dis- 
placing the fabric of skill and delight. 

Mrs. Palliser's book, which is primarily 
technical, touches these questions only inci- 
dentally. But that it does touch them, and 
always with the accurate prick of fact, gives 
it wider significance than it could otherwise 
have, and renders it pleasureable as well as 
illuminating to the general reader.

Ireland has kitchen-middens, shell-

yielded invaluable prizes to the arcn-

occupied the island at an almost inconceivably re- 
mote period of time, — men of the Paleolithic or 
Older Stone Age, cannibals, ignorant of the art of 
pottery, and possibly ignorant of the use of fire. 
Yet they had some idea of a continued existence 
after death, which constitutes the norm of a relig- 
ious faith. From this norm, more or less com- 
plex systems of religion were developed among 
the various races occupying the land in succession, 
— Formorians or Fomorians, Firbolgs, Danaans, 
Milesians and others, — -none of them wholly ex- 
terminating the precedent races or obliterating the 
features of their religion. It was in the fifth century 
of our present era that Christianity was introduced

into the island by one of the three s&intg. traditions 
of whom have been worked by the monastic bagi- 
ologists into a strange oUa podrida, or Irish stew, 
that serves as the biography of Patrick, the Patron 
Saint of Ireland. In his " Pagan Ireland, an Areh- 
eological Sketch : a Handbook of Irish Pre-Chris- 
tian Antiquities," Colonel W. G. Wood-Martin, 
M.B-I.A., gave ns several years ago a graphic de- 
scription of this religion. It was a religion full of 
superstitions. How could it have been otherwise? 
Colonel Wood-Martin now gives as a fuller knowl- 
edge of the same subject, in two sumptuous vol- 
omes on the " Traces of the Elder Faiths of Ire- 
land" (Longmans), which he also calls "A Folklore 
Sketch" and a "Handbook of Irish Pre-Christian 
Traditions." In the former work he ransacked the 
kitchen-middens. In the more recent companion 
volumes he investigates the lore and legends and 
the superstitious practices of the Irish, with a view 
to a more perfect knowledge of their religion. His 
contention is that though Christianity is generally 
sapposed to have annihilated heathenism in Ireland, 
"in reality it merely smoothed over and swallowed 
its victim, and the contour of its prey, as in the 
case of the boa-constrictor, can be distinctly traced 
under the glistening colours of its beautiful skin. 
Paganism still exists, it is merely inside instead of 
outside." And in support of this contention we have 
two octavo volumes aggregating more than 700 
pages of text, comprising a most entertaining col- 
lection of superstitious practices, legends, traditions, 
and folk-lore. We have no fault whatever to find 
with the theory Colonel Wood-Martin seeks to main- 
tain. But it is somewhat anachronistic in him to 
suppose that he is maintaining it in the face of what 
he is pleased to call -the theologians." The aver- 
age theologian of the present day is no stickler for 
Archbishop Ussher's Chronology. He readily ad- 
mits, and without fear of ecclesiastical censure, that 
the worship of the heathen was rendered to some 
object which symbolized a debased and unworthy 
conception of Deity, and that the same worship 
might laudably be rendered to the true God ; and 
that many usages of heathen times have been 
adopted by the Church and endowed with Chris- 
tian meaning. The modern "theologian" distinctly 
calls attention to the fact that the earliest Christian 
art was largely an adaptation of such heathen sym- 
bols as might be converted readily to the teaching 
of Christian truths. As with matters of public fes- 
tivals and in the use of art. so with countless minor 
usages which had become a part of man's mental 
habit toward those mysterious questions as to man's 
existence which lay at the base of primitive religion. 
No country on the face of the earth is richer in 
legendary lore than Ireland. Some of it is, so far 
as is known, peculiar to the Irish people. Some of 
it is possessed in common with all Indo-European 
races. It has been preserved, in one form or an- 
other, by oral tradition among the unlettered, since 
long before the Christian era. And now that the 
science of folk-lore has advanced beyond its merely 



antiquarian stage, and since its correlation to phil- 
ology, archeology, ethnology, and history are fully 
recognized, we may congratulate ourselves that all 
these traces of the Elder Faiths have been preserved 
in order that they may be studied and may tell us 
much more of the past than we should otherwise 
know. Christian teachers, no less than others, will 
acknowledge their indebtedness to the patient toil of 
Colonel Wood-Martin in collecting the vast material 
for his volumes, and presenting it with illustrations 
numbering more than 180, with a bibliography cit- 
ing more than 900 titles, and with a helpful index 

to each volome. 

A Utitry '* English Music in the XlXth Cen- 

tfrnsifr* tury " (Button), by Mr. J. A. Fuller 

Aiyibi_«M. Maitland, is the first of a series of 
volumes intended to give an account, as exhaust- 
ive as possible, of the progress of music and mu- 
sical knowledge during the last century in such 
countries as England, France. Germany and Aus- 
tria, Italy, the Slavonic lands, Scandinavia, and 
the United States. In the introduction of the in- 
itial volume, the editor voices the optimistic view 
that in England musical knowledge has increased 
so fast, and become so comparatively widespread, 
that the country bids fair to reoecupy that posi- 
tion which she has not held since the day of 
Pnrcell, — " for music is slowly but surely be- 
coming again an integral part of the life of the 
|>eople," With the single exception of the inor- 
dinate love of foreign as compared with English 
music, the general artistic atmosphere of the 
country was by no means a low one, and the reason 
that no great works were produced during the first 
half of the century must be sought ebewhere than 
in any public indifference to the art ; however, it 
does not take a lengthy explanation to show the 
reader of the present day how complete in the ear- 
lier part of the century was the severance of the 
operatic stage from anything that could make for 
the interests of English art in any form. In a chap- 
ter on church composers, Mr. Maitland points out 
that until quite late in the last century the music of 
the English Church was a thing by itself ; the an- 
them was a form distinctly and characteristically 
English. " If the musical influence of the English 
Church is less than it was, the cause is to be found 
in the wider artistic views of the average musician, 
and it is probably an inevitable result of the Renais- 
sance that the noble traditions of the past should 
seem to suffer." Yet, after all, is it not true that 
there would be a nearer approach to a reconciliation 
between conflicting interests if there was a closer 
sympathy between the standard of music within 
the church and that of educated society outside ? 
Church music thrives best when it retains a con- 
scious touch with the large musical movements of 
the world. Taking a prospective view, the author 
believes that the main evils of the country's musical 
life are threefold : first, the diffusion of public in- 
terests ; second, the bane of professionalism ; and 
third, the fungus of commercialism. And, as a

parting admonition, he expresses the belief that 
music in England is the only one of the arts that 
has a vivid life at the present moment ; and it is 
for the English to set the example of appreciating 
native attainment, if that attainment is ever to en- 
joy, what English music has never yet obtained, the 
wide recognition of the rest of the world. On the 
whole, Mr. Maitland has skilfully drawn from a 
somewhat abundant material only that which can 
lend color and form to the characterization of his 
subject. The book is not a mere conglomeration 
of odds and ends, having no definite purpose in 
view, but a finely composed mosaic, each part being 
carefully fitted to its neighbor, and its separate 
value and identity made to subserve the general 
e£fect, tracing the history and progress of English 
music during the nineteenth century. 

siudietin Sociologists have pointed out from 

Experimental time to time the necessity of collect- 
Socioiogy. j„g ^ large number of data, and of 

demonstrating from observation the principles in- 
volved. Too much of our sociology is merely the 
philosophy of society expounded in the class-room ; 
good, wholesome culture-study it is, but not calcu- 
lated to give definite character to the science. This 
must come from a careful scientific investigation of 
society as it is, rather than from a philosophy about 
society in the ideal. The recent work by Miss 
Frances Kellor on " Experimental Sociology " 
(Macmillan) is one of the boldest attempts of mod- 
ern times to study abnormal society from an " ex- 
perimental " standpoint, or, what would seem a more 
appropriate expression, from the standpoint of sci- 
entific investigation. This kind of investigation is 
in this domain the most difficult in the whole range 
of science. The chemist has control of the elements 
with which he works ; the botanist can analyze the 
plant with little difficulty, destroying it if neces- 
sary ; the zoologist may make the forms of animal 
life entirely subservient to science; but the sociolo- 
gist must be dependent upon the whims of human 
beings or the caprices of society for his knowledge. 
He may watch and observe what individuals do in 
their social capacity, but he has no power to dissect 
society or force it through experiments, as the an- 
atomist does the cat, the biologist the bacteria, the 
zoologist the frog, or the botanist the plant. Espe- 
cially difficult is the study of the broken parcels or 
remnants of humanity, such as the delinquents or 
criminals, which Miss Kellor has had the courage 
to attempt. Lombroso,Corre,and others in Europe, 
have done much to throw light upon the subject of 
criminals, but no one in America has before at- 
tempted to systematically study female offenders. 
Miss Kellor has gone about from prison to prison, 
opening laboratories for the study of delinquents. 
While the results are not final, — for, indeed, the 
work is considered by the author as only a begin- 
ning, — it points the way to a system of thorough 
investigation. While there are many discouraging 
features in final conclusions, it must be remembered 



that Lombroso, with his years of study, has finally 
been forced to renounce his favorite assumption 
that there is a universal criminal type distinguished 
from the non-criminal. Nevertheless, Lombroso's 
work is of incalculable value to humanity, and espe- 
cially to the science of criminology. Probably, in a 
different way. Miss Kellor's work will prove of in- 
estimable value to the study of social pathology. 
The book throws much light upon the penal system 
of the South, the causes of crime, and the increase 
of criminality among women. It points out the 
defects in penal and correctional systems, and sug- 
gets methods of preventing crime. It is a valuable 
contribution to sociological literature. 

Professor Jacoby's volume of "Prac- 
Praeiicai talks by ^^^^l -p^jj^g jj ^n Astronomer" 
an attronomer. ,„ ., , • ^ t • i 

(Scribner) consists of a series or 

eighteen chatty essays on various astronomical 
topics of popular interest, appearing originally in 
periodicals. The subjects handled are such as " The 
Pole-star," " Galileo," " Photography in Astron- 
omy," "The Heliometer," "The Moon Hoax," 
" The Sun's Destination," etc. Technicalities are 
eschewed, and matters difficult of explanation are 
handled in so deft a fashion that the reader is 
unconscious of mental strain. The information con- 
veyed is up to date, and generally accurate. Occa- 
sionally there is a slight error which will scarcely 
escape the notice of a critical reader. For example, 
the first sentence on page 89 is erroneous through 
neglect of the effect of refraction. Again, on page 
148 we read concerning unimpeded sea-waves that 
" they consist simply of particles of water moving 
straight up and down." On page 189, in line 6 
from below, for "impossible" one should read 
" possible." Remembering the uncertainty of our 
knowledge as to the exact location of the sun's 
goal, one is rather astonished to read on pages 
222-3 the following statement: "A tiny circle 
might be drawn on the sky, to which an astronomer 
might point his hand and say, 'Yonder little circle 
contains the goal toward which the sun and planets 
are hastening to-day.' " Despite these and a few 
other inaccuracies of the sort. Professor Jacoby's 
essays may be characterized as in the main trust- 
worthy ; they are also fresh and readable. 



Records of 
an ideal 
/riendship. 



Enthusiasm over a concordance, a 
tender and devoted friendship owing 
its origin to an index, a ten-years' 
affectionate correspondence between a gifted En- 
glishwoman and an American admirer thirty years 
her senior, — this is the novel spectacle afforded 
us by the " Letters to an Enthusiast" (McClurg), 
written between 1850 and 1861 by Mary Cowden 
Clarke to Robert Balmanno of New York. A scrap 
of the manuscript of Mrs. Clarke's " Shakespeare 
Concordance " had come into Balmanno's hands 
through Douglas Jerrold's intervention, and the 
happy recipient acknowledged the favor by sending 
the lady a handsome present, — six gold pens and

two fine pen-holden. She, ignorant of the donor's 
name and sex, responded by addressing a letter of 
thanks " To The American Enthasiast, New York 
City," which, to the great credit of oar postal service, 
safely reached its destination. Hence the present 
Tolame. Mrs. Clarke admits in one of her letters 
that she and Charles are poor hands at collecting, 
and utterly nnentbasiastic on the subject of auto- 
graphs. Therefore the one-sidedness of this pub- 
lished correspondence. Only one of Balmanno's 
letters was preserved, and we feel much like the 
listener to a telephone conversation, our ears catch- 
ing only what is spoken into the transmitter. If 
the editor, Mrs. Anne Upton Nettleton. could have 
added more explanatory notes (she gives a few), 
our indebtedness to her would be completer. Her 
introduction and index are helpful. A remarkable 
feature of this friendship, — a friendship that grew 
ever warmer as the years passed, — is that the 
friends never met. Each was married, with home 
ties and duties, but each reserved a warm comer of 
the heart for the transatlantic friend. To Mrs. 
Clarke her corresfKtndent was " Dear Enthusiast," 
and to Balmanno she was his '- danghter-in-love." 
Many a charming glimpse of the happy home-life 
at Bayswater is given us. The two Shakespearians 
were indeed "a pair of married lovers." The 
literary enthusiasms of Mrs. Clarke lend her let- 
ters no small part of their charm. She delights 
in Bryant as a '* true poet." She always kisses 
Douglas Jerrold's handwriting when she sees it. 
She has the greatest admiration for Leigh Hunt. 
She speaks often of '* beloved and honoured Charles 
and Mary Lamb." If we have not now made our 
readers long for the book, we give them up in de- 
spair. It is admirable summer reading. 

Mr. Walter Crane's text-books on 
'• The Bases of Design " and " Line 
and Form " have been reissued by the 
Maemillan Co. in a new and cheaper form, which 
is quite as serviceable if not as sumptuous as the 
first editions, published respectively in 1898 and 
1900. In spite of obvious deficiencies, these books 
may be commended as among the best elementary 
aids to the study of design that are available. In- 
tended primarily to trace the relationship between 
the various arts of design and their dependence 
upon the same underlying principles, the field cov- 
ered in '■ The Bases of Design " is necessarily a 
wide one, and the attempt to treat it even gener- 
aUy within the limits of a single volume gives a 
discursive character to the work and results in a 
lack of proportion between the several branches of 
the subject ; of this, however, the author is fully 
conscious. Notwithstanding this limitation , the work 
is one of much practical value, and has the advan- 
tage of having been written by an artist and not 
by one whose knowledge is only at second-hand ; 
the principles inculcated are sound, and much use- 
ful technical information is introduced by way of 
illustration. "Line and Form," which, like its 






companion volume, is made up from lectures de- 
livered to the students of the Manchester Munici- 
pal School of Art, deals with the various elements 
of composition, and explains, perhaps as well as i» 
possible in a book, the considerations which the 
designer should take chiefly into account. If it 
falls somewhat short of being a comprehensive 
treatise, the author tells us that 1^ intention is to 
be suggestive and helpful without attempting to be 
exhaustive in dealing with a subject which, as he 
truly says, "it would be difficult enough to ex- 
haust." It would therefore be invidious to com- 
plain that we must look elsewhere for insight into 
the higher qualities, such as harmonic proportions 
and line and space ideas, which nevertheless are 
fundamental to good art.

While avowedly indebted to Mr. 

Gardiner's great seventeenth-een- 
^fsimajt. jijyy history, and to the well-known 

works of Miss Strickland and Mrs. Everett-Green, 
" Five Stuart Princesses " (Dutton), written by five 
Oxford men, including the general editor, Mr. 
Robert S. Rait, is a compilation of more than 
ordinary merit. The available authorities seem to 
have been conscientiously consulted, and each bio- 
g^phy presents both a character sketch of its sub- 
ject and a view of the political and social conditions 
of the time. Elizabeth of Bohemia, daughter of 
James I.; Mary of Orange, daughter of Charles I. 
and mother of William III.; Henrietta of Orleans, 
a younger sister of the foregoing ; and Sophia of 
Hanover, granddaughter of James I. and mother 
of George I., — these four comprise a somewhat 
nearly related g^oup of royal dames of the seven- 
teenth century. To them has been added a fif- 
teenth-century princess, Margaret, daughter of 
James I. of Scotland, and danphine of France. 
Her story is little known, and is well worth re- 
peating. The book will be all the more welcome 
because of the interest in several of its characters 
aroused by recent historical studies from the pens 
of Mr. W. H. Wilkins, Mrs. Henry Ady, M. Jos- 
serand, and others. Eight portraits and a view of 
Princess Margaret's tomb accompany the text.

we may expect something worth reading. For he 
succeeds where most writers upon scientific subjects 
fail, in making natural history interesting to the 
average reader by writing in a style suited alike to 
the scientific and the unscientific mind. His recent

point OS. It is a large book, containing more than

but 80 popular is the author's style that in most 
cases the glossary has but to refer to a page of his 
text, where the term will be found fully explained. 
The book is of the same general character as the 
author's "Scenery of Switzerland and the Causes 
to Which It Is Due," and Sir Archibald Geikie's 
" Scenery of Scotland Viewed in Connection with 
its Physical Geography." It is, in fact, a history 
of scenery; and to the lovers of scenery the de- 
lights of a beautiful landscape will be greatly en- 
hanced by the knowledge which may be derived 
from this book of the natural causes that have 
been operating for ages for the production of moun- 
tain, river, lake, plain, forest, and coastrline. For 
the knowledge of physical geography and physical 
geology into which Lord Avebury initiates his read- 
ers may be applied to scenery all over the world. 
And this book, no less than others by the same 
author, stimulates the reader to observe closely 
what has been going on in the world about him. 
He may find that even law and custom have not 
been without their influence upon the scenery of 
the land in which he lives, and that local divisions 
and the sites of towns are closely related to the 
causes that have shaped the features of a land- 
scape.

feiting accounts of the disasters and delights of

sentimental young wives ; with full records of their 
pleasant and even flippant conversations on garden 
topics with their patient husbands ; with a proper 
touch of comedy in their altercations and collab- 
orations with gardeners of foreign birth, whether 
Irish or German. It amused us once or thrice ; but 
we fear Judith must act out her little part to a scant- 
ily filled house, notwithstanding the fact that the 
book is in many ways a good one, with many pages 
of interest for garden-lovers and garden- workers, 
and some clever word-painting. In outward form, 
the volume is most attractive. Each page is en-

BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Mississippi Historical Society (Mr. Franklin L. 
Riley, secretary) sends us Volume V. of its Publica- 
tions, consisting of an inventory of historical material 
relating to the State, whether held in public or private 
hands. Prepared by many hands, under the direction 
of the Mississippi Historical Commission, this document 
is of great value to students of Southern history, and 
represents a useful form of activity that every State in 
the Union should undertake while there is yet time. 



Throughout the country, historical material of the ut- 
most importance is being recklessly or ignorantly de- 
stroyed, aud a systematic effort should be made every- 
where to arrest this vandalism. It is highly encouraging 
to note the efforts made by Mississippi with this end in 
view, and there are not a few States, even in the North, 
that might profit by this Southern example. 

The publishers of the " Athenseum Press Series," 
Messrs. Ginn & Co., have done wisely in commissioning 
a volume of " Selections from Ue Quincey " for that 
admirable collection of English masterpieces. De 
Quincey is past the stage in which his works are likely 
to be read (or even possessed) as a whole ; yet there 
are things among them that no lover of good literature 
would willingly let die. Dr. Milton Haight Turk is 
the editor of the present volume, which is a substantial 
one, offering four hundred pages of text, besides fifty 
of introduction and another hundred of notes. We 
have here the " Confessions," selections from the 
" Suspiria," several autobiographical and reminiscent 
chapters, and two or three of the more popular mis- 
cellaneous papers. 

The Department of Superintendence of the National 
Educational Association met in Chicago last February 
for a three days' session. The proceedings of the con- 
ference are now published in separate form, pending 
their later appearance in the annual volume of the 
Association. Among the papers read, we note as of 
special importance the following : " Obstacles to Edu- 
cational Progress," by Professor Paul H. Hanus; "The 
Value of Examinations as Determining a Teacher's 
Fitness for Work," by Superintendent E. G. Cooley; 
" The Ideal Normal School," by Professor W. H. Payne; 
" The Danger of Using Biological Analogies in Reason- 
ing on Educational Subjects," by Commissioner W. T. 
Harris; " Altruism as a Law of Education," by Prin- 
cipal Arnold Tompkins; and " The High School as the 
People's College," by President G. Stanley Hall. 

The new Dodge lectureship at Yale on "The Re- 
sponsibilities of Citizenship " is well begun by a general 
course on " American Citizenship," given by Justice 
Brewer of the Federal Supreme Court, and now pub- 
lished in a small volume by Messrs. Scribner's Sons. 
As the author says in his preface, it is made up of " a 
few plain, simple, commonplace truths in respect to 
those responsibilities," but these truths are so put as 
to appeal to college men and to earnest young men in 
general. The truths enforced are the obligations of 
citizenship, especially the maintenance of a good char- 
acter, service, obedience, and the duty of striving to 
better the life of the nation. This last lecture is very 
inspiring, making a strong appeal to young men to 
cherish high ideals of national and social life, and to do 
their utmost to bring the realities into harmony with 
them. 

A fragment (two chapters and the beginning of a 
third) of " The Moores," a projected novel by Charlotte 
Bronte, serves as the pretext for a new edition of the 
complete writings of this novelist. Mr. W. Robertson 
Nicoll is the editor, and Messrs. Dodd, Mead, & Co. 
are the American publishers. Other unpublished frag- 
ments are also promised, a very doubtful boon. Dr. 
Nicoll's introductions aim to connect Charlotte Bronte's 
life with her books, and the editor has made use of all 
the biographical material that is now ever likely to 
be available. " Jane Eyre," in a handsome volume of 
over five hundred pages, is the initial volume of this 
edition.

lished by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The compilation is made 
by Misses Gertrude L. Stone and M. Grace Fiekett, and 
tlia adeetions are grouped according to tbe orders and 
species with which they are concerned, thus providing 
a felicitous combination of botany and literature. 



"The Service," an essay by Thoreau hitherto un- 
published, is issued in a finely-printed volume from the 
Merrymount Press by Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed, Bos- 
ton. Originally submitted to " The Dial " in 1840, but 
declined by Margaret Fuller (then editing that perio- 
dical) for reasons not altogether obvious, the manu- 
script of " The Service " passed into Emerson's hands, 
and later came into the possession of Mr. F. B. San- 
bom, the editor of the present publication. The essay 
is distinctly worthy the beautiful dress now given it, 
and collectors should hasten to secure copies of the 
limited edition in which it is issued.

FOUR COOLING NOVELS 



A GREAT VERANDA NOVEL 

The Lady Paramount 

By HENRY HARLAND, author of " The Cardinara SnufE-box " 
(85,000). 12mo, $1.50. 

The 50th Thousand Just Printed. 

Xew York Times' Saturday Rrvieto : 

" There are some books which woo one to the Springtime. Such 
a book is Henry Harland's latest story, ' The Lady Paramount.' En- 
joyment of it would not be complete unless it were read in the park, 
under the trees, or while idly swinging in a hammock. It is fresh, 
•weet, and pure — now rare praise." 
T?te Evening Sun : 

" It is the wittiest and brightest book of the season." 



DOLF WVLLARDE'S LIVELY NOVEL 

The Story of Eden 

Decorative cover, 12mo, S1.50. 

The Brooklyn Sagle writes : 

"A brilliant, rery entertaining novel, full of lively conversation, 
and free from any sort of morbidness or dreary pretension — very 
frank and unaffected. For once in a way, everything comes out all 
right ; the dreaded witness was, in fact, dead ; so Madge^s secret re- 
mains conveniently buried forever — and that is how it happens in 
real life more frequently than not.**

12mo, $1.00 net. 
The New York Sun : 

" Didn't Elizabeth of the famous ' Visits ' marry an earl ? To the 
best of our recollection she did. There is much of the same sort of 
cleTemess in this book as in the other. Carlton, who is the author 
of the preface, says : ' 1 've read every word and I like it.' We agree 
with Carlton. This particular countess is all right." 
The New York Commercial AdvertUer : 

"The ' Comments ' are wonderfully bright and clever." 



BRIQHT, LIQHT, AMUSING 

An English Qirl in Paris 

Decorative cover, 12mo, $1.50. 

This story shows, in a delightfully witty and humorous vein, very 
cleverly drawn pictures of the life of an English girl in French so- 
ciety as compared with that of the much chaperoned French made- 
moiselle. It is really witty and amusing. Our freedom loving Ameri-

ALEXAND ER TH E GREAT. 

*' I was born," says Alexandre Damas, " at 
Villers-Cotterets, a little town in the depart- 
ment of the Aisne, on the Paris road, about 
two hundred paces from the Rue de la Noue, 
where Demoustiers died, two leagues from 
La Ferte-Milon, where Kacine was born, and 
seven leagues from Chateau-Thierry, where 
La Fontaine first saw the light. I was born on 
July 24, 1802, at half-past five in the morning, 
in the Rue de Lormet, in a house which now 
belongs to my friend Cartier, who would gladly 
sell it to me any day, so that I may be able to 



die in the very room where I was born." As 
a matter of fact, he never did buy the house, 
bat died, December 5, 1870, in a little town 
near Dieppe, whither he had been carried from 
Paris by his devoted son, on the eve of the 
German investment of the Capital, in order 
that his last days might be spared the priva- 
tions of the siege. Something more than a year 
later, when his country was again at peace, his 
remains received final interment in his native 
town, in the presence of a famous following of 
authors, artists, and actors. 

The bit of autobiography above quoted is 
characteristic at onoe of the geniality and the 
egotism of the man who wrote it. It quite 
takes for granted the reader's interest in every 
slightest personal particular that the writer 
may see fit to impart : it takes also for granted 
the reader's acceptance of the fact that neither 
Racine nor La Fontaine could possibly shed 
any greater lustre upon the region of their com- 
mon birth than was shed by the author of 
"Monte Cristo " and " Les Trois Mousque- 
taires." Of his own greatness, indeed, Alex- 
andre Dumas retained an unshaken conviction 
throughout his long career. At the height of 
that career, he could assert with perfect self- 
assurance that for a quarter of a century past 
three men, Hugo. Lamartine, and himself, had 
remained at the head of contemporary French 
literature; our only marvel is that he should 
not have set his own name first in that trinity 
of literary fame. We are not of those to whom 
such assertions are always and necessarily 
amusing. They may express the proud self- 
consciousness of genius, or they may merely in- 
dicate a remarkable capacity for self-deception. 
When Dante and Shakespeare state what we 
know to be the simple truth concerning their 
own work, we applaud rather than rebuke, 
holding such frank utterance in higher esteem 
than any exhibition of mock modesty. But in 
the case of Dumas the effect of such self 
assertion is, on the whole, an entertaining 
illustration of the delusion of the egotist. 
That he was a great writer in the sense in 
which Hugo was a great writer is, of course, a 
preposterous notion : and that he should hon- 
estly have ranked himself with his most illus- 
trious contemporary shows only the fact that 



28

[July 16, 



his critical faculty, weak in any case, was 
absolutely incapable of taking the measure of 
his own work. 

Although a writer of only the second rank, 
Dumas looms up astonishingly in the French 
literature of the last century, and he still holds 
his own surprisingly well. In some respects 
his position is better to-day than it was at any 
time during his life. His enemies did their 
worst to break down his reputation while he was 
still alive ; after his death, there was nothing 
more to be urged against him than had already 
been urged, and his fame did not suffer the re- 
action that commonly follows upon the death of 
a great writer. Dumas was never set upon such 
a pinnacle as Hugo in the esteem of his admir- 
ing fellow-countrymen, and hence was never 
in so perilous a position. He was immensely 
popular, but he was not revered as a prophet 
and a sage. He has preserved his popularity 
at home for a full generation after his death, 
while abroad he is both better known and better 
appreciated than he was at any time while alive. 

Long before Dumas had become popular 
with English readers, at a time when they 
thought of him, so far as they thought at all, 
as of a writer whose stock in trade was a shal- 
low sensationalism and a picturesque perver- 
sion of historical happenings, he was known 
and loved by no less a man than Thackeray, 
who found no diflBculty in rising above English 
prejudice and contracting a very genuine sym- 
pathy for the most gasconading of Frenchmen. 
But as far as the English-speaking world is 
concerned, the vogue, if not the fame, of Dumas 
seems to have been mainly posthumous. The 
last generation was inclined to regard with dark 
suspicion the works of all French novelists, and 
the romances of Alexandre Dumas were held, 
mostly by persons who had never read them, 
to be typically " French " in their wicked levity, 
and consequently to be shunned by all right- 
eous minded readers. When translated into 
English, the romances were published in such 
a way as to repel persons of taste, and attract 
only those classes of readers to whom literature 
proper makes no appeal whatever. Well do 
we remember the big and ugly volumes, badly 
printed and bound in depressing black, in which 
form alone the American readers of twenty or 
thirty years ago might make the acquaintance 
of " d'Artagnan " and " Monte Cristo." Things 
are very different now, when tasteful editions 
abound, when the old-fashioned prejudices have 
disappeared, and when we have all of us become 
more or less denizens of the joyous realm of 



romantic invention which is still ruled by the 
spirit of Alexandre Dumas. 

It was along in the eighties, we should say, 
that English and American readers of the more 
discriminating sort came to be attracted in con- 
siderable numbers to the romances of Dumas. 
Before that time, his following had been large 
but uncritical, — it had been a following made 
up for the most part of seekers for the sensa- 
tional in literature, of readers who were sat- 
isfied with highly-spiced invention, and who 
recked little of constructive art. But Dumas 
really deserved a better fate than the applause 
of this class of readers, and he received his 
deserts in due course of time. It was about 
twenty years ago that two English critics of 
undeniable authority gave assurance to timid 
souls that their enjoyment of the French ro- 
mancer was quite legitimate, and that the 
adventures of the three musketeers really be- 
longed to literature. It is, we think, chiefly 
to Mr. Andrew Lang and Robert Louis Stev- 
enson that the literary rehabilitation of Dumas 
with the English-speaking public is to be cred- 
ited, for these men boldly proclaimed what 
many readers of taste had felt without quite 
daring to assert. They had coupled in thought 
the names of Dumas and Scott, but Mr. Lang 
ventured to make the conjunction on the printed 
page. Addressing the spirit of the Frenchman, 
he said: 

" Than yours there has been no greater nor more 
kindly and beneficent force in modern letters. To 
Scott, indeed, you owed the first impulse of your ge- 
nius; but, once set in motion, what miracles could it 
not accomplish ? Our dear Porthos was overcome, at 
last, by a superhuman burden; but your imaginative 
strength never found a task too g^eat for it. It is good, 
in a day of small and laborious ingenuities, to breathe 
the free air of your books, and dwell in the company 
of Dumas's men — so gallant, so frank, so indomitable, 
such swordsmen, and such trenchmen." 

This frank and generous praise is echoed by 
Stevenson, who, closing his " Vicomte de Bra- 
gelonne " after the fifth perusal, expresses his 
enthusiastic admiration in a series of queries 
which are in fact challenges to all disputants. 

" What other novel has such epic variety and nobil- 
ity of incident? Often, if you will, impossible; often 
of the order of an Arabian story; and yet all based on 
human nature. For if you come to that, what novel 
has more human nature ? Not studied with the micro- 
scope, but seen largely in plain daylight, with the natu- 
ral eye? What novel has more good sense, and gaiety, 
and wit, and unflagging, admirable literary skill . . . 
And, once more, to make an end of commendations, 
what novel is inspired with a more unstrained or a more 
wholesome morality ? " 

These words take us far indeed from the stand- 



1902.]

point of middle-class propriety and narrow 
puritanical outlook. They mark the larger 
and saner critical light in which our own gen- 
eration has come to view the famous literature 
of the past. 

In the presence of such tributes as these, the 
unlovely aspects of the character of Dumas, 
and the dubious aspects of his literary methods, 
sink into relative insignificance. Granted that 
he was a swaggerer and vainglorious, that petty 
jealousies and hypocrisies marked many stages 
of his career, that in his financial relations he 
held his personal honor too lightly ; granted 
also that his literary supercheries were of un- 
exampled audacity, that he pillaged ideas and 
situations from all sorts of sources, that he lent 
his name to books that others had written, — 
granted all these things, with many others of 
like tenor, the fact remains that he possessed 
an astonishingly original and prolific genius, 
that besides much slipshod writing that has 
long since been forgotten he produced a series 
of masterpieces that the world will not willingly 
let die, and that his higher ideals were on the 
whole ideals of manliness and clean living and 
devotion to admirable artistic aims. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



"AMKRICAN ENGLISH" AGA.IK. 
(To the Editor of Thk Duo.) 

"•\nswer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also 
be like unto him," says the Scripture; and then, with a 
fine recognition of the perplexities of the case, immedi- 
ataly adds: "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest 
he be wiae in his own conceit." An uosel&sh regard for 
the good of the unwise person seems to dictate the lat- 
ter course. 

An anonymous contributor to the Jane " Macmillan's 
Magazine," taking for his subject " Our Unhappy Lan- 
guage," discourses on what he calls " the American lan- 
guage," in a manner that is marked by less wisdom than 
we are wont to look for in the pages of that excellent 
periodical. We are told that ours is a distinct lan- 
guage, not bearing the relation even of a dialect to the 
parent tongue, and that its variations from English 
can be discovered almost as readily as the differences 
between Italian and Spanish. We are rebuked for 
angrily denying this. " I guess," one of us is said to 
hare retorted, " that what you call Amurracan is the 
only form of English which it English anyway." This 
protest is regarded by our Unhappy Ling^uiat (if we 
may so style him, for convenience) as " too involved 
to be very intelligible." To be sure, it is not a fair 
sample of our mode of expressing ourselves, any more 
than the speech of the cockney is a good illustration 
of the Englishman's; but the alleged involution is not 
apparent to a plain man. Five out of any ten English- 
speaking Germans, says the Unhappy Linguist, will 
apologetically explain, in the interest of truth, that 



they learned the language from Americans, and there- 
fore can not speak it very well. The present writer 
takes pleasure in recalling, from his Berlin university 
daja, instanees of Germans who, seeking to perfect 
their English, favored him with their society because, 
as they explained, the American pronunciation seeaed 
to them more articulate than the En^sh. But this tes- 
timony is far from conclusive, aad is adduced only for 
what it is worth. In the PolggUM Kmtze series .there 
is said to be a manual on Die Atmerikmmudke Spraeke, 
side by side with one on Die Englitdke Spradie. That 
certainly is damaging testimony, and the defendant, on- 
til he has examined the volume in question, is pnzxled 
for an answer. Again, we are accused of having made 
the word commence (in preference to begin) so pecul- 
iarly our own that the Unhappy Linguist now almost 
shrinks from defiling his month with it. This is indeed 
alarming, if troe. 

From the page* of two American novels — names not 
given — our i aw Bant takes the text for most of his dis- 
course. We think it safe to infer that the novels are 
not classics; but let as see what can be said in their 
defense. *' His eyes were wonted to the darkness," is 
cited, with condemnation of wonted as an undesirable 
neologism. Yet, two hondred years ago, Sir Boger 
L'Estrange wrote, " She was wonted to the place, and 
would not remove." "E'en in our ashes live their 
wonted fires," illustrates a slightly different use of the . 
word, which is probably familiar even to the Unhappy 
Linguist "The merciless frame vised him fast." On 
this our friend has something interesting to say. " The 
verb to rise is a revelation to us, and would seem to be 
derived from the noun vice by false analogy (bleaaed 
words!) with the verb advise. However, the only poa- 
sible meaning we could read into it would be ezpreo- 
sive of what consuls do to passports." Charity compels 
na to interpret this, not as ignorance of a familiar car- 
penter's tool, but as an attempt to be facetious. We 
bear in mind, too, that the more common English spell- 
ing of this tool is rice. But the making of a verb out 
of a noun, to serve at a pinch, is a pnetiee not confined 
to American writers. Amazement and amusement ate 
excited when the hero of one of the novels referred to 
is said to feed his horse apples, and the critic wonders 
if the day will come when the Lord Mayor will feed 
his guests turtles. We hope not. Meanwhile we shall 
continue to feed our swine husks, and also to feed them 
with husks, but we prefer to let our guests help them- 
selves to such viands as their appetite demands. "So 
he," for " so that he," is cited as something new and 
strange. Without considering the matter, we shonld 
have said the shorter form was not uncommon, even 
with English writers. Opening at random Mr. G. W. E. 
Russell's "Onlooker's Notebook," we read (page 149), 
"America was strong and Spain was weak, so we backed 
America for all we were worth." Other usages, more

perhaps none, are distinctively American, and not one

A list of "American words " is given by oar Unhappy 
Linguist, followed by a condemnatory exclamation point. 
The words are, defense, pretense, rvmor, dishonor, labor, 
counselor, traveler, imperiled, groveled, marveled, untram- 
mded, and maneuver. Six of these would have served 
to illustrate all the principles involved. Lack of spaee 
forbids a full discussion, and other hands have treated 
these matters at length. Yet we can never cease to 
wonder why the English cling so jealously to u in

honour, but drop it in horror, pallor, terror, actor, author, 
and a hundred other words having exactly the same 
Latin-French pedigree. Retaining the French u in cer- 
tain cases, why does the Englishman insist on discard- 
ing the French s in defense and offense, which are de- 
rived originally from Latin forms in -ensaf In Middle 
English we find forms in -ens and -ense; the form in 
■ence is a comparatively late departure from the good 
old spelling. Likewise the ending -or represents, as a 
rule, an earlier English -our; but whereas our cousins 
have reverted to the Latin form in some cases, and not 
in others, we in America, for the sake of both brevity 
and uniformity, have dropped the u almost without 
exception. The English lexicographer Ogilvie, by the 
way, gives pretense as the better spelling of the second 
word on the list. So much for that "American word." 
" We do not in the least care," concludes the Un- 
happy Linguist, " how the Americans spell, but in these 
days of simultaneous editions on either side of the At- 
lantic we see danger to our own spelling, about which 
we do care." In other words, " we don't care how fast 
you Americans go to perdition, but pray don't take us 
with you." We do not yet despair of the English lan- 
guage. It has weathered a dozen centuries and more, 
and its decay does not seem imminent. But not until 
it is a dead language, or the English fence themselves 
in with a Chinese wall, will it anywhere be preserved 
in a state of rigid unchangeableness. p, p, 3.

Comments of a Contemporaky.*' 

Applying Mr. John Morley's test of litera- 
ture as distinguished from mere printed matter, 
and demanding that it shall contain "moral 
truth and human passion . . . touched with a 
certain largeness, sanity, and attraction of 
form," one would not be far wrong in pro- 
nouncing " An Onlooker's Notebook " to be 
literature. It is written with a journalistic 
crispness of style that carries the reader along 
from page to page without sense of fatigue, 
and the writer's breadth of view and range of 
experience distinguish him from the ordinary 
reporter of current events. These chapters on 
men and manners of the present and the more 
immediate past are reprinted from " The Man- 
chester Guardian," where they appeared dur- 
ing the year 1901. Their anonymous author 
is Mr. George W. E. Russell, whose earlier 
volume of reminiscences and whose life of 
Gladstone in the "Queen's Prime Ministers" 
series have been well received. 

The first half of the book treats largely of 
matters political, the latter of social questions. 
Democracy the author regards as a disappoint-

lections and Recollections." NewTork: Harper & Brothers. 



ment, so far at least as the high hopes enter- 
tained for it thirty years ago are concerned. 
From the glorious height of a divine ideal it 
has sunk to the bumble level of a fairly prac- 
ticable system. But he admits that it has 
never received a thorough trial in England, 
except in local affairs, where indeed the ex- 
periment gives hope of future capacity on the 
part of the people for treating "the higher 
and deeper proplems of imperial government." 
Significant in this connection is the author's 
firm conviction that " a hereditary legislative 
body is a mistake." 

Five short chapters on the monarchy, from 
1760 to 1901, give fleeting views of four suc- 
cessive sovereigns and their courts, and bring 
us down to the present reign, of which Mr. 
Russell ventures to predict four chief charac- 
teristics. First, it will be popular : the King, 
losing nothing of the tact and grace that marked 
his bearing as Prince of Wales, will have the 
support of all his people. Second, it will be a 
splendid reign, reflecting the sovereign's nat- 
ural taste for pomp and his freedom from 
parsimony. Third, it will be marked by im- 
partiality, Edward VII. keeping his politics 
to himself as strictly as he did before his ac- 
cession. Fourth, it will be an active reign, as 
the court will reside in London and will play a 
conspicuous part in public affairs. 

The latter half of the book is made up of 
brief and entertaining discussions of such 
topics as society journalism, the pleasures of 
publicity, the ways of the new woman, filthy 
lucre, religious observance, hedonism, decorum, 
superstition, card-playing and gambling, the 
public schools, the universities, and the church. 
The decline of chivalry and the growth of a 
selfish materialism are deplored. 

" To-day chivalry seems to me extinct. The one 
idea is to shout with the largest crowd, to back the 
winner, to side with the majority. America was strong 
and Spain was weak, so we backed America for all we 
were worth. We believed that France was weak, and 
we tried to pick a quarrel with her over Fashoda. The 
Armenians were a feeble folk, and we would not move 
a finger to save them from massacre. Greece is a little 
country, and we had nothing but clumsy ridicule for her 
struggle against the Turkish tyranny. We were told 
that the South African republics had lost the power of 
fighting — and we are learning our lesson." 

Mr. Russell has some shrewd and amusing 
things to say about the art of living on nothing. 
Among the devices practised by its devotees 
are the following : 

" Time out of mind ladies have claimed all the hon- 
ors at whist, and, where their adversaries were shy or 
careless, they have not seldom derived profit from the 



1902.]

claim. The worthy couple whom I described as ' The 
Stavmakers ' used to arrange with one of their sons to 
meet them in hospitable country houses. When the 
whist-tables were made up, father, mother, and son 
used to sit down and entice some unwary youth to be 
the fourth. The points were moderate — shillings and 
half-crowns — but whicherer way the Inck went, a 
greater or less sum was bound to find its way into the 
coffers of the family. . . . Most people know some 
fashionable couples who eke out a rather narrow income 
by poker and bridge. It is calculated by the friends 
who hare the pleasure of losing to them that they make 
several hundreds a year; but no one ever dreams of 
suggesting unfair play. Luck is pretty equally dis- 
tributed; but skill, courage, and facial control are 
qualities which succeed at cards as elsewhere; and a 
great advantage of playing in your own house is that 
the party can be broken up as soon as the hostess feels 
tired or the host has had enough of it." 

The foregoing, we take pleasure in thinking, 
would have found no place in the notebook of 
an American onlooker, describing American 
society life. Some of the hnmilations to which 
a person must submit who cultivates the gentle 
art of living on his wits are vividly pictured by 
Mr. Russell. He borrows for his purpose 
Thackeray's " dear young literary friend, Tom 
Garbage." 

" The popular girls pronounce him ' a little horror,' 
and won't dance with him on any terms. The young 
men regard him as an outsider; and the old gentlemen 
make him the butt of their peculiarly unpleasing humor. 
Lord Cramlington meets Tom Garbage in Piccadilly, 
and accosts him with a friendly and hospitable air: 
' Are yon going to dine anywhere to-night. Garbage ? ' 
Tom, scenting an invitation, promptly says ' No.' ' By 
Gad, what an appetite yon '11 have to-morrow! ' replies 
Lord Cramlington, and walks away with a cheerful 
smile. . . . Or, again, poor Tom is the guest of Sir 
Thomas Portmore, famous for his cellar, and inadver- 
tently puts his hand round his claret-glass. ' I see that 
claret isn't warm enough for you,' says the host; and 
then, ringing the bell with great violence, roars to the 
butler: ■ Take that wine away and boil it, and put plenty 
of sugar and spice in it; and then perhaps it will suit 
your palate, Mr. Garbage.' " 

The thirst for notoriety receives a sharp re- 
buke from our author, who regrets the depar- 
ture of old-fashioned modesty and reserve. 

" We live in and on publicity. Where our fathers 
repelled the society journalist from their doors and 
horsewhipped him if they caught him at his tricks, we 
encourage him to the top of his bent. Only twenty 
years ago I have known a man blackballed at a club 
because he was suspected of having written for a society 
jonmal, and a guest who published the names of his 
fellow-guests at a dinner-party was never again per- 
mitted to cross the violated threshold. But now the 
smartest people take the society jonmalist to their 
bosoms. He dines with them in London and stays with 
them in the country. He is invited to iitapect the bed- 
rooms and examine the plate and scrutinize the family 
jewels. . . . The interviewer is abroad in the land, and 
to him people of the highest cultivation disclose their 
private beliefs in religion and politics and literature. 



They supply lists of ' Hymns that have Helped Me ' 
and ' Prayers that have Pushed Me '; they enumerate 
their 'Hundred Favorite Books'; they resuscitate the 
memories of the nursery and the private scbooL . . . 
Reticence has fled to Jupiter or Saturn, and, as all 
speech is unguarded, so all life is public." 

Verily, one is ready to say with Ovid in the 
enforced seclusion of his distant exile, " Bene 
qui latuit, bene viiit." Heaven deliver us 
from the insanity of this ever-spreading " social 
pushfulness," as our author calls it ! But after 
these and many other pictures of all sorts of 
degeneracy, chiefly among the aristocracy, we 
are refreshed with a few final chapters on the 
more hopeful signs for the future ; and these 
indications of higher ideals the writer finds in 
the very class he has been holding up to repro- 
bation, as well as among the ranks of the people. 

" I am well assured that among young Englishmen 
of all grades and classes there is a vein of manly self- 
control and self-devotion which may yet prove to be the 
salvation of England when national judgments begin to 
overtake national sins. . . . We are officially informed 
that the supply of clergy is falling off; but though the 
young men at Oxford and Cambridge who are now 
seeking holy orders may be fewer than they were twenty 
years ago, I am convinced that their quality is better. 
There is nothing epicene or namby-pamby about them. 
They are fine, manly, active fellows, keen in mind and 
strong in body; men who have rowed for their colleges 
or plaved ' rugger ' for the university, and ready to con- 
secrate all their splendid gifts of health and skill and 
trained endurance to the service of religion and hn- 
manitv. . . . Snch institutions as Toynbee Hall and 
Mansfield House, though conducted on secular lines, 
display the same energy of youthful real directed to 
high ends; and I fancy that most of the great provin- 
cial towns conld tell the same tale as Liverpool with its 
Newsboys' Home and Food and Betterment Associa- 
tion. ... A few years ago there was a vulgar fashion, 
for which Thackeray and Leech were mainly responsible, 
of holding up clerks and servants to promiscuous and 
ptointless ridicule. A truer conception of honorable 
service now obtains, and English footmen and grooms 
have given as good an account of themselves in South 
Africa as the sons of the houses which they served." 

Mr. Russell is a keen observer, and he turns 
to good literary account what he sees and what 
he hears. His acquaintance with the Dowager 
Duchess of Cleveland, whose long life covers 
the years 1792-1883, has furnished him with 
numerous early nineteenth-century items of 
interest. From Bishop Wilberforce also, and 
from Gladstone, Beaoonsfield, Lord Aberdeen, 
and other noble sources, he draws many anec- 
dotes of high life, — not always new, but never 
tedious. His rather curious excuse for neg- 
lecting the less exalted classes is that his master, 
Matthew Arnold, has already chosen the com- 
mon people for his own province. Yet he is 
not a snob, and if he shows an occasional touch

of Thackeray's snobbish anti-snobbery, it is 
too slight to offend. To those who relish 
dexterous word-play the book offers an occa- 
sional toothsome morsel, despite, or perhaps 
partly because of, its rather free use of the 
most up-to-date slang — in apologetic quotation 
marks. Ochlocracy^ a handy antonym to 
oligarchy, masquerades as othlocracy, but in a 
quoted sentence, so that the blame cannot be 
fixed. Now and then a little-used Latin phrase 
greets one as a pleasant surprise in its English 
dress. Finally, and best of all, the brief space 
accorded to each topic shows the author to have 
learned well that hardest of lessons for a fluent 
writer, that a part is better than the whole.

Two Good Garden Books.* 



Two of the best of Mr. Lane's numerous 
garden books are Canon Ellacombe's " In My 
Vicarage Garden " and Mrs. Milne-Home's 
" Stray Leaves from a Border Garden." It is 
a matter of fact and of interest that the En- 
glish clergy have been garden-lovers since the 
days of old when priests and monks found in 
their gardens sources of physic, pleasure, and 
profit. Through their missions they secured 
rare and beautiful plants, and introduced val- 
ued fruits and vegetables ; and in the sheltered 
" gardens enclosed " of their monasteries they 
could preserve and multiply, experiment with 
and disperse, the new plants. 

Of the modern English clergy, the best- 
known flower-lovers and flower-rearers are 
Dean Hole, champion of the English Hose ; 
and Canon EUacombe, author of " In a Glou- 
cestershire Garden " and of that most satis- 
fying, charming, and perfect book, " The 
Plant-Lore and Garden-Craft of Shakespeare." 
In this book, " In My Vicarage Garden, and 
Elsewhere," appears aftermath of the author's 
Shakespearian research, in the chapters en- 
titled "Plant Names," "York and Lancaster 
Roses," and " Shakespere and Architecture." 
Fascinating subjects are " The Scents of Flow- 
ers " and " Medical Properties of Flowers," in 
which the curious " doctrine of signatures " is 
most ably and interestingly explained. This 
" doctrine " has been held from the time when

the Preacher gave as one of the qualities of 
the Wise Man, " certain knowledge of the 
things that are . . . the diversities of plants 
and the virtues of roots." It was, in brief, 
" nature's own prescription," — a belief that 
each plant revealed in its shape or color some 
resemblance to a disease or to some portion of 
the body, and therefore was of value in that 
disease or for strengthening that organ. Thus, 
a heart-shaped leaf was used in heart disease ; 
a spotted leaf like pulmonaria was for diseased 
lungs ; a plant with swellings at the joints of 
the stem or the leaf-stalks would cure gout. 
This doctrine was universally believed, and be- 
loved ; for it was quoted as a proof of the loving 
care and thoughtful provision of the Creator. 
Though the working out of this principle is, of 
course, wholly wrong, yet the principle itself 
was based on right ; and its influence is still 
shown in our modern botanical arrangement 
and classification of plants. 

A chapter of special interest is entitled 
" Railway Gardens." This does not mean the 
beds and borders of ornamental flowers at rail- 
way stations, growing so cheerfully under ad- 
verse conditions, and so welcome to the eye 
of the traveller. The subject is, instead, the 
expanse or groups of unusual and unexpected 
flowers which spring up in startling beauty in 
railway " cuts," in ballast heaps, in refuse 
" dumps." The raw ugly track of the railway 
contractor is quickly covered with a garden of 
Nature's planting, — a rare garden, too ; for 
flowers which have not been seen in a certain 
vicinity for years will bloom forth in abun- 
dance after the blasting out of a line of rock. 
The ballast heaps below Philadelphia have re- 
vealed hundreds of rare plants, many from the 
Orient, which have been classified and written 
about as Ballast Plants. Sweeps of old-time 
garden-flowers reappear and blossom in glorious 
profusion. Canon EUacombe names the London 
Rocket, the wild Valerian, the Canterbury Bell, 
Viper's Bugloss, the Bee Orchis in " railway gar- 
dens." Railway cuttings in America have been 
a happy hunting-ground both for geologist and 
botanist. I have for years made notes of the 
revelations of the railroads. At times but a 
tantalizing glimpse is given to the dasher-by ; 
but other times sudden and spirited onraids 
of friendly brakemen, during a pause while 
the panting engine is swallowing water, have 
secured wonderful prizes and surprises. To 
the English list I can add borders a mile 
long of Bouncing Bet ; acres of orange-tawny 
garden-lilies ; beds of coreopsis ; rock-cuttings

hung with harebells : a certain old-fashioned 
garden campanula ; moss pink : and a half- 
double garden-plant of the feverfew family. 
And I have gone far beyond Canon EUacombe 
in my speculations, and found elements of the 
romantic and beautiful with which to confound 
the spirit and refute the sneers of that railroad 
hater, Rnskin. No flower-dreams of deeper 
sentiment come to me than the thought of the 
wandering of those flower-seeds, — their dor- 
mant years of silence and darkness, their travel 
hither, their sudden release and resurrection 
through modern progress. But all this may 
be over-fanciful, or, as Shakespeare says, 
" ' Twere to consider too curiously to consider 
so. 

" Stray Leaves from a Border Garden," 
Mrs. Milne-Home's book, reveals not only a 
romantic home and picturesque garden on that 
historic spot, Flodden Field, but also the 
charming personality of the author. The book 
is an intimate record, — a human document, in 
the best sense of that much-twisted term. We 
can never disassociate author and book ; and 
as nothing about this author's life has been 
printed in the American press, we may be per- 
mitted a bit of information. The daughter of 
an English soldier. Major Ellis, the great- 
grandchild of the Irish patriot Lord Edward 
Fitzgerald, she is now the widow of Colonel 
Milne-Home of the Royal Blues, that gallant 
old soldier who died six months ago at his Bor- 
der home. He won laurels and decorations in 
Egypt and India in his youth ; and in later life 
this flower-loving young wife in Jamaica. This 
is not the first book written by Mary Pamela 
Milne- Home. Almost in her girlhood she wrote 
" Mamma's Black Nurse Stories " and " West 
Indian Folk- Lore, " — tales of the wonderful 
An-ansi legends of Jamaica, familiar to us 
in the American book," " Annancy Stories," 
by Mary Pamela Coleman Smith. Tinges of 
color from Jamaica gardens show in this tale 
of the Border, and of Continental gardens 
as well, especially of Provence, another home 
of the author. One of the pleasing character- 
istics of the book is the constant recounting 
of the folk-lore of England, Scotland, Russia, 
Jamaica, France ; the folk-lore of personal ob- 
servation, bearing the thrill and fire of first 
telling, not the decorous recording through 
a succession of quotations and transcriptions. 
There is ample proof, too, of extended reading 
among ancient herbals and flower-books. 

A charming series of pictures entitled " My 
Friends in Their Gardens " might well be 



carried out in like by other garden-writers. 
There are portrayed — five or six pages being 
given to each — a Squire's garden, a Provence 
garden, the Rector's garden. Black Jacob's 
garden in Jamaica, Padre Avelino's garden in 
Trinidad, a Swiss burial-place, etc. The Bor- 
der Garden, where Mother and Boy sowed and 
weeded, and rejoiced over what Bacon called 
" garden-delights," and mourned over their 
garden-tragedies, must be read in every page, 
and every page will be enjoyed. 

In the year 1881 Mr. Jackson put the num- 
ber of botanical works then existing at over 
eight thousand. In the following soore of 
years, enormous numbers of such books have 
been published ; the year and a half of this 
century numbers hundreds, perhaps thousands, 
since there now exists a so-called craze for 
garden and flower books. There have been 
books of vast cost, — like Sibthorpe's " Flora 
Graeca," in the production of which over fifty 
thousand dollars was spent, — and books on 
specialized topics ; but for general reading, 
for novel, pleasant, and useful information, for 
intelligent and graceful English composition, 
the two books under our consideration hold 
firmly their own dignified and creditable posi- 
tion in the face of the regiment of their fellows.

We think there are few books which in a 
quiet way will do the serious student more 
good, or deserve better of its readers, than 
Mr. Bryce's recent volume of " Studies in His- 
tory and Jurisprudence." These essays form 
a book on whose nine hundred and odd pages 
the reader will find very little chaff of words, 
and much excellent and substantial informa- 
tion, presented in a popular manner and with 
the charm of literary style. They bear the 
stamp of the mind not only of an academic 
teacher of many years" experience, but also of 
a statesman active in the service of his coun- 
try, and perhaps still more of a student and 
exponent of historical and constitutional ques- 
tions. Mr. Bryce's treatment of such questions 
has always been eminently characterized by 
fairness, sound sense, and the practical grasp 
of a man prominent in active life and accus- 
tomed to living issues as well as to theories

and speculations. When a writer of such rec- 
ognized standing, wide experience and scholar- 
ship discusses matters of historical and practical 
importance, his remarks naturally awaken keen 
interest ; and the friendly hearing which any 
word of Mr. Bryce can command in America 
will add considerably to the attention given 
this new work of his. 

Attention is aroused by the opening essays, 
wherein the author compares the two greatest 
nations of European history, ancient and mod- 
ern, — the Romans and the English. The 
study of Kome becomes nowadays more and 
more a necessary introduction to historical 
study in general, even among the English ; and 
no less than half the number of essays con- 
tained in Mr. Bryce's book are more or less 
directly concerned with the universal side of 
Kome's rule. Of course, the similarity of 
Koman and English political ideas instantly 
presents itself, both countries establishing 
their law among many nations ; and the simi- 
larity is to be noted, also, in their imperialistic 
tendencies and their holding distant provinces 
by means of colonization. As Mr. Bryce ex- 
presses it in his preface, " The longer one lives 
the more is one impressed by the close connec- 
tion between the old Graeco-Italian world and 
our own. We are still very near the ancients." 
The empire of India is the largest and so far 
the most successful experiment in England's 
imperial policy. The two first essays set forth 
the chief points of resemblance between Rome 
and Great Britain. The subject is not treated 
in any great detail, but what is said gives a 
sufficiently vivid impression of the difficulties 
encountered by each nation in governing a 
foreign province. Of these difficulties, those 
felt by the English in properly ruling India 
appear by all odds the more serious. Other 
essays related to these are the fourteenth and 
fifteenth, which treat of methods of law- 
making and the history of the development of 
jurisprudence in Borne and in England ; and 
these are among the most suggestive in the 
book. The last essay discussing kiudred legal 
points is the one " On Marriage and Divorce 
in Roman and English law," which will not 
only excite interest in itself but to many will 
appear a timely addition to the present active 
controversy regarding the revision of divorce 
laws. The author's rather conservative view, 
which seems to consider frequency of divorce 
largely a convenient stepping-stone to polyg- 
amy, will doubtless be approved by many. 

It is in modern constitutional law and his- 



tory that Mr. Bryce is considered most pro- 
ficient, and the reader follows with pleasure 
his treatment of such questions as " Flexible 
and Rigid Constitutions," "The Action of 
Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces on Politi- 
cal Constitutions," "The Commonwealth of 
Australia," and, last but not least, as a precious 
anomaly, the essay on the old constitution of 
the only permanent republic of pure Germanic 
origin, primitive Iceland. Although one of the 
briefer essays, this is nevertheless one of the 
most interesting. The author is evidently 
delighted with this quaint old commonwealth, 
whose peculiarities he explains with his cus- 
tomary lucidity. Mr. Bryce probably never 
visited the historic isle, nor studied its ancient 
laws ; but he has drawn his information from 
the next best source, the writings of the great 
jurist and Germanist Konrad Maurer, whose 
monographs and historical works hold so high 
authority in Germanistic literature. Perhaps 
Mr. Bryce's account will awaken some interest, 
even among American students, in the Ger- 
manic North, where lie the true sources of an 
understanding of Germanic life. 

These essays on constitutions, Mr. Bryce 
supplements by others of a philosophical char- 
acter, in which he discusses " Obedience," 
"The Nature of Sovereignty," "The Law of 
Nature," " The Relations of Law and Religion," 
essays which under any circumstances will 
command admiration for the author's clear 
reasoning, observing mind, and judicious treat- 
ment. They are well adapted to the under- 
standing of any thoughtful person, and will no 
doubt be of influence both in political and pro- 
fessional life. 

One of the chief characteristics of the book 
is its prevalent tone of caution. Perhaps it is 
due to this extremely temperate spirit that even 
Mr. Bryce sometimes seems vague, and afraid 
of broaching vital questions, — especially when 
treating of the far-reaching imperial policy 
of England, with which he perhaps does not 
altogether sympathize. Thus, one of the few 
things which the reader accepts with incre- 
dulity, even from Mr. Bryce, is the statement 
(pp. 119-120) that English law may become 
the law of all India and the Christian religion 
supersede the native beliefs. This, it appears 
to us, is to carry the comparison between Rome 
and England too far. Of course, such an event 
depends in the end upon the continuance of 
English rule. " Experience," says Mr. Bryce, 
" goes to show that no form of heathenism . . . 
does ultimately withstand the solvent power of

European science and thought." Bat we doabt 
exceedingly that an Occidental belief, even 
when fortified by science, — which, it may 
be remarked, generally helps to neutralize 
its force, — will ever transplant an Oriental 
belief, conceived and upheld as it is by the 
far subtler power of distinguishing between 
the apparent and the real which is inherent in 
the Oriental mind. When one reads that, in 
one part of India, out of a population num- 
bering more than forty-four millions a little 
more than a hundred thousand are Christians, 
who are again divided up into denominations, 
one does not know whether to laugh or to 
weep over the phantom of future Christiani- 
zation of the East in general and India in par- 
ticular. Besides, if it is true, as many earnest 
voices assert — voices from among the En- 
glish residents themselves — that English rule 
has served only to impoverish India (Mr. 
Bryce himself points to excessive taxation as 
one of the greatest dangers of English rule), 
how can the expensive English government be 
maintained on an increasing public debt and 
a decreasing power of the population to yield 
adequate revenue ? Mr. Bryce points to the 
large area not yet under cultivation ; but re- 
formers point to the increasing frequency of 
famine and plagues, the financial results of 
which may yet prove too much for even the 
British administration and its unlimited money 
credit. And as for the ultimate sway of En- 
glish law. as long as the Hindoos themselves 
are not trained to administer it, or appointed 
as justices of it, English law remains at best 
an adaptation. The Oriental mind will by 
degrees outlive it, and rise to something more 
congenial with its own tendencies. Mr. Brvce 
himself pictures what would be the result if 
England withdrew her forces ; but it is never- 
theless true that no nation as gifted as the 
Hindoo can forever remain in bondage to a 
foreign and alien race so utterly unsympathetic 
to the mass of the people as the English has 
proved itself to be. The awakening of the 
East must come : and when the united nations 
of Europe shall be able to cope with En- 
gland at sea, a European war will ensue which 
will seal the fate of English dominion in India. 
Unhappily, these conjectures are not. as Mr. 
Bryce suggests, merely speculative. 

The book concludes with two addresses, one 
introductory, the other valedictory ; the open- 
ing and closing of an activity as academic 
teacher the best fruit of which these essays con- 
tain. The author himself expresses the fear 



that some of these may not altogether be able 
to meet the demands of modern criticism ; bat, 
to quote his own words, " Life is short . . . 
and it seems better to let what I have written, 
under the constant pressure of other duties, 
go forth now." It seems but fitting to express 
the expectation that in view of the author's 
well-earned popularity with the American pub- 
lic, this last book of his should be at least as 
widely read as his others have been.

Dr. Hosmer has rightly judged the time 
appropriate for the publication of a popular 
account of the purchase of Louisiana. The 
scope of his book would have been better in- 
dicated had he retained the title by which it 
was originally announced and called it " The 
Story" rather than "The History" of the 
Louisiana Purchase. The work is distinctly 
intended for the general reader, and even for 
readers of the younger class. With this ob- 
ject in view, the author has enlarged upon the 
dramatic and picturesque features of the event, 
and has either touched very lightly or omitted 
altogether the more abstruse and difficult ones. 
His main purpose has been to show that the 
transfer was almost wholly the work of Napo- 
leon, and thus to correct the common opinion 
that it resulted from the superior insight and 
wisdom of Jefferson. Jefferson's merit con- 
sisted almost solely in accepting the good for- 
tune that befell him. Dr. Hosmer tells the 
whole story of Napoleon's quarrel with his 
brothers Joseph and Lucien over the sale, 
which he is the first to render accessible 
in English in its entirety. A somewhat fuller 
account of the San Domingo revolt would have 
been interesting and at the same time would 
have brought out more clearly the pressure 
under which Napoleon acted. But measured 
by its purpose the story is well told and the 
book entirely successful. For the student, it 
does not and is not intended to supersede the 
chapters in Mr. Adams's history. 

Upon one point Dr. Hosmer has tripped. 
Marbois, in his account of the sale of Louisiana, 
says that Napoleon, wishing " to have the 
opinion of two ministers, who were familiar

with those countries," summoned them to a 
conference on Easter Sunday of 1803. To 
one of the ministers " the administration of 
the colonies was familiar "; the other " had 
served in the auxiliary army (I'armee auxil- 
iare) sent by France to the United States 
during their revolution." The first minister 
was Marbois himself, who was minister of 
finance, and had served in the United States 
in a diplomatic capacity and in San Domingo 
as Intendant of the colony. It was prob- 
ably well understood, at the time Marbois 
wrote, who the second minister was ; but later 
writers have rather curiously omitted his iden- 
tification. Dr. Hosmer assumes that it was 
Decres, minister of marine. This is scarcely 
possible. Decres served in the fleet, and not 
in the army, as described by Marbois ; and he 
was so young at the time, his service was so 
short and his position so subordinate, that he 
could scarcely have become " familiar " with 
America. The minister referred to was un- 
doubtedly Berthier, minister of war. Berthier 
served three years in the "auxiliary army" in 
America, was aide-de-camp to Kochambeau, 
attained the rank of colonel, and, after peace 
was negotiated, returned to France by way of 
San Domingo. He thus had every opportunity 
of acquiring a knowledge of conditions both 
in the United States and in the colony. There 
were, moreover, several reasons why Berthier 
was most likely to be consulted. His relations 
with Napoleon were most confidential, he was 
the negotiator of the preliminary treaty of St. 
Ildefonso for the retrocession of Louisiana, and, 
in view of the fact that the sale of the province 
turned upon war with England, he was, next 
after Napoleon himself, most directly interested 
in the subject. Dr. Hosmer refers to Clay as 
the author of the Missouri Compromise. The 
statement is probably accidental, but it does 
seem as if the impression that Clay arranged 
what we think of as the Missouri Compromise 
would never be effaced. 

Another Louisiana book is " an historical 
study," by Mr. Louis Houck, entitled "The 
Boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase." The 
author says that " The fact that much erro- 
neous information in regard to the boundaries 
of the Louisiana Purchase has, during the last 
few years, been industriously circulated by the 
daily press and otherwise, must be the excuse 
for the publication of this study." Inasmuch 
as Mr. Houck is himself wrong upon all the 
essential points, his little book will scarcely 
serve its intended purpose of setting the pub- 



lic right. His work shows a very considerable 
amount of investigation, but very little histor- 
ical judgment. He seems to have adopted the 
motto, " My country, right or wrong," and, 
upon that principle, to have knocked down to 
the credit of the Louisiana Purchase every- 
thing that has at any time been claimed for it. 
Although the boundaries of Louisiana were 
never definitely described, its general extent 
is perfectly clear and perfectly certain. It 
included the Isle of Orleans east of the Mis- 
sissippi, and the whole basin of that river and 
its tributaries west of it. Mr. Houck claims 
that it included in addition Florida west of the 
Perdido river, Texas, and Oregon. 

The case of Florida is too clear for contro- 
versy. Having failed in their efforts to acquire 
West Florida, the United States set up the 
claim, under an apparent ambiguity in the 
treaty, that the part west of the Perdido was 
included in Louisiana. Historical facts, too 
involved and complicated for present state- 
ment, are absolutely conclusive against this 
contention. Mr. Houck considers that the 
decision of the Supreme Court proved the 
American construction ; but, although Mar- 
shall did argue that the language of the treaty 
would admit of either construction, and that 
strong arguments might he adduced in sup- 
port of the American one, he avoided any 
inquiry into the merits of the question, and 
based his judgment solely upon the ground 
that the court was bound to follow in such 
questions the opinion of the political depart- 
ments of the government. The claim to Texas 
was threshed out in the negotiation of the 
Florida treaty, was revived in 1844 for politi- 
cal purposes, and since then has been brought 
forward from time to time by writers in search 
of a sensation. It rests wholly upon La Salle's 
short-lived and ill-fated colony. The colony 
itself was a mistake, and its whole effort was 
devoted to its abandonment. Whatever claims 
might have resulted were forieited by its im- 
mediate destruction. The Spanish occupation 
of Texas was continuous from its earliest set- 
tlement, and, even during the Spanish occu- 
pation of Louisiana, Texas was maintained as 
a separate colony. It is true that Napoleon in- 
tended to extend Louisiana to the Rio Grande ; 
but what could be more absurd than to base a 
claim of right upon an edict of Napoleon's? 
Louisiana included as much of northeastern 
Texas as falls within the basin of the Red 
river, and that is all. The bulk of Mr. Houck's 
book is devoted to an argument to prove that

Louisiana included Oregon. The French claim 
to L/onisiana rested wholly upon the occupation 
of the Mississippi basin : and as there is no 
single instance of occupation beyond that 
basin, L#ouisiana could not possibly have in- 
cluded more, and all argument to the contrary 
falls to the ground. The United States never 
claimed Oregon as a part of the Louisiana 
Purchase, but as a result of it. The idea that 
Louisiana included Oregon originated in an 
error in a map published in the Census of 
1870, which resulted from a misreading of the 
map in Marbois's " Louisiana," and this error 
was perpetuated and disseminated for nearly 
a generation by the map of the United States 
issued by the General Land Office. The Land 
Office map has been corrected, but the im- 
pression produced by the old map upon many 
minds still remains. p. H. HoDDEK. 



Essays on American Themes.* 



Charles Francis Adams writes no dull es- 
says. From his *• Chapters of Erie," in which, 
more than thirty years ago, he first made his 
bow to the reading public, to his just pub- 
lished volume, " Lee at Appomattox, and Other 
Papers,"' he has written upon a great variety 
of important topics, but always with a ripe 
scholarship, a grac« of style, and a thorongh 
understanding of the subject discussed, which 
endow his volumes with a perennial charm. 

The opening paper, which gives title to the 
volume, is in effect a contrast between the 
methods of General Lee of the Confederate 
army and President Krnger in South Africa. 
The capture of Pretoria by General Roberts, 
in June, 1900, was the Appomattox of the 
South African Republic. After each battle, the 
result of the war was no longer doubtful. But 
in the Southern States still existed Confederate 
armies of magnitude, and throughout the Con- 
federacy was the feeling of great bitterness 
toward the North. Jefferson Davis, after the 
surrender of Lee's army, issued a proclamation 
worthy of Kruger, urging that a guerrilla war- 
fare be kept up until the North should drop 
the contest from sheer exhaustion. But Lee 
was a man of broader and grander type. He 
saw that the Confederacy was doomed, and 
had the wisdom to take a course which should 
stop the needless effusion of blood and save 
the Southern States from a devastation like

FWaeia Adams. Boston : Hoog-hton. Mifflin & Co. 



that which marked Sherman's march from 
Atlanta. His personal popularity caused his 
views, rather than those of Davis, to prevail. 
Kruger, seeing clearly the inevitable end, per- 
sisted in a course which, as Mr. Adams states, 
he knew must result " in the probable destruc- 
tion of one of the combatants, in great loss to 
the other, and in utter disregard of the best 
interests of both." Mr. Adams has given in 
detail General Lee's actions and his discussions 
with his officers for the twenty-four hours be- 
fore his final surrender, and gives him great 
and deserved credit for a course which was 
perhaps the greatest factor in bringing the two 
warring factions of the nation to the present 
conditions of harmony. 

The second and most important paper in Mr. 
Adams's volume is entitled "The Treaty of 
Washington," and refers to the treaty concluded 
between the United States and England pro- 
yiding for the arbitration of the claim of the 
United States for damages suffered by our 
merchant marine from Confederate cruisers 
fitted out in English ports, which treaty also 
made a new standard in reference to the rights 
of private property in cases of war. Mr. Adams, 
through access to papers of his father, — who 
was our ambassador in London during the Civil 
War, and afterward a member of the Court of 
Arbitration, — and also to the papers of Ham- 
ilton Fish, has been enabled to give an inside 
account, and a most interesting one, of the 
origin and adjustment of such claims, much of 
which is wholly new to the general public. 

The English Cabinet took the position that 
while it would be an infraction of the laws of 
neutrality for ships of war to be built and 
equipped in English shipyards, and sold to the 
Confederacy, yet it was no infraction of the 
law for unequipped war-ships to be built and 
so sold, and for the armament of such ships to 
be built and so sold, in case the armament was 
not put aboard the ship in an English port. 
So the " Alabama " was built as a war vessel, 
and sailed from Liverpool to the Azores. At 
the date of her sailing her armament and mu- 
nitions of war were shipped on another vessel 
from London to the same port, and were 
there transferred to the ship. This method of 
getting around the spirit of the law was 
sanctioned by the English Cabinet, and ap- 
held by the Courts. Three vessels, the " Flor- 
ida," " Alabama," and " Shenandoah." were 
thus fitted out, and preyed destructively upon 
our commerce. The English position was 
based upon a sympathy on the part of the

governing classes for the South, a belief by 
these classes that the South would win its 
independence, and a desire to promote the 
lucrative business of building ships for the 
world in English shipyards. After a time, 
aided by the gradual triumph of the Northern 
armies, the English people became awakened 
to the dangers of their position in case their 
nation, owning nearly half the merchant 
marine of the world, should become involved 
in war. Such a war, for instance, as that 
which has prevailed in South Africa would 
have allowed such nations as the United States 
or Germany, under this precedent established 
by England, to cover the ocean with privateers 
carrying the flag of the Dutch Eepublic, to 
the utter destruction of the English merchant 
navy. Thereupon the English government 
stopped the further building of privateers ; 
and then followed years of diplomacy, whereby 
England sought to render ineffective the 
precedent she had herself established, and 
the United States to recover damages for the 
work of the English-built privateers. These 
negotiations were completed during the presi- 
dency of General Grant, and largely through 
the work of his premier, Hamilton Fish. The 
history of the rupture between Charles Sumner 
and General Grant's administration, one factor 
in which was the recall of Mr. Motley (who, 
because he owed his appointment to Sumner, 
conceived his duty to be to report to Sumner 
rather than to the State Department), from his 
position as Embassador to England, is fully 
and most interestingly told by Mr. Adams. 

Another article, entitled " An Undeveloped 
Function," embodies the suggestion that our 
various Historical Societies, from a broad 
standpoint, should endeavor to shed light by 
their discussions on political questions of na- 
tional importance. In " A National Change 
of Heart " is indicated the reason of the friend- 
ship which of late has developed in England 
toward the United States. 

The whole volume is most interesting and 
instructive ; it is one of the comparatively few 
books of the year of permanent value. Mr. 
Adams has been not alone a man of letters, 
but a man of affairs, — has successfully man- 
aged great corporations, has travelled widely, 
and been on terms of intimacy with many of 
the most notable statesmen and diplomats of 
his period. From this training and experience 
few men now living could have so clearly dis- 
cussed the subjects treated in the volume.

Engiuh poetry ^^ attempt to consider scientifically 
in ihe crucible the general phenomena of poetry and 
o/thescienti,i. ^^ suggest a new system of prosody 
is the avowed purpose of Prof. Mark H. Liddell's 
" Introduction to the Scientific Study of English 
Poetry" (Doubleday). In this book the theories 
presented are based upon the belief that language 
and literature offer a field for scientific treatment 
much like that of econonaics or ethics. Professor 
Liddell sets aside all definitions and " present no- 
tions " of poetry, and calls them " vague and bewil- 
dering," " literary and not scientific," based upon 
" the emotional susceptibility of the individual to 
respond to poetic phenomena, and not upon the ab- 
solute and catholic concepts of science." All such 
general notions of the nature of poetic phenomena 
the author considers quite valueless for the study of 
poetry; and after several pages devoted to the in- 
adequacy of present definitions he arrives at a defi- 
nition of poetry of his own making, which reads as 
follows : " Poetry is literature, usually of a high de- 
gree of Human Interest, which in addition to its 
Human Interest has in it an added Esthetic Interest 
due to the arrangement of some easily recognizable 
and constantly present concomitant of thought-for- 
mulation into a form of aesthetic appeal for which an 
appreciative ^^thetic Sentiment has been gradually 
developed in the minds of those who habitually 
think by means of the language in which the poetry 
is written." By the aid of an algebraic formula. 
Professor Liddell is enabled to express this defi- 
nition of poetry in the following concise form : 
x + HI + VF, — meaning " id6as formulated in 
terms of correlated sound-group-images " + Human 
Interest + Verse Form. Professor Liddell then pro- 
ceeds to show the inadequacy of the present system 
of English prosody, and states that in his treatment 
of the subject of poetry from a strictly historical and 
inductive point of view he at the outset parts com- 
pany with the usual treatises on English prosody. 
Historically, his book is decidedly disappointing, as 
there is practically no account given of the differ- 
ent kinds of poetry nor their stages of development ; 
and the author's inductive point of view has led him 
into some strange inferences and generalizations, to 
which it would not be unjust to apply his own ad- 
jectives "vague and bewildering." His system of 
prosody involves much that is revolutionary and is 
destructive of well established rules, and, " failing 
scientific formulation and scientific terminology," 
he has invented a nomenclature and notation of his 
own which is too eccentric to be helpful. For 
" verse " he substitutes the words " thought-mo- 
ment"; for "feet," "waves of impulse"; and he 
prefers to do away with the use of any terms used 
in classic prosody. We cannot see that Professor 
Liddell has added anything to the excellent work 
which has already been done in the study of English 
prosody. His methods and his style are for the 
most part unsatisfactory, and his theories may most

m*t^^il» popular treatment of the nebular 

mlar litem. theory of the evolution of the solar 

system has long been a desideratum. Sir Robert 
Ball has at last supplied this in his latest volume 
entitled "The Earths Beginning" (Appleton). 
Like " Star-land," by the same author, this volume 
had its origin in a series of lectures given to 
audiences of young people under the auspices of 
the Royal Institution of Great Britain. But, un- 
like the earlier volume, the present one will be 
best appreciated by adult readers. After a gen- 
eral statement of the nebular theory, and a de- 
scription of some of the most notable nebuls. with 
special reference to those of spiral form — since 
tbis has now been shown by photogrraphy to be the 
typical form — the author considers the sun. He 
shows that the heat of the orb of day is now main- 
tained by the same process of contraction that has 
been going on for ages, and reasons backward to 
the primeval nebula in which the solar sjrstem 
originated. Next follows one of the most interesting 
portions of the book, in which our knowledge of 
the present state of the earth's interior is set forth 
admirably, with a discussion of seismic and volcanic 
phenomena. Several chapters are then devoted to 
the evidences for the truth of the nebular hypothesis 
derived from our planetary system. The book 
closes with a series of short appendices giving 
mathematical explanations of matters of interest 
in connection with the contraction of a nebula. 
Here and there the critical reader will detect a 
minor blemish ; three of these we may mention. 
Near the bottom of page 36 the foci of certain 
ellipses are said to lie at the sun's centre ; on page 
55 Professor Barnard is given credit which properly 
belongs to Professor Bailey ; on page 252 we read 
of "the area which each particle of the planet de- 
scribes," which is clearly not the author's meaning. 
But minor inaccuracies like these detract little 
from the solid merit of the book. It is excellently 
printed on heavy paper, and is embellished with four 
colored plates and sixty-three other illnstratioBS, 
most of which are taken from celestial photog^raphs.

The eleventh volume of " The 
World's Epoch-Makers " (Seribner) 
is devoted to " The Medici and the 
Italian Renaissance," and is written by the editor 
of the series, Mr. Oliphant Smeaton, M.A. The 
purpose of the volume is to trace the continuity of 
aim which moved the various members of the great 
house of Medici, and show by what steps and in 
what forms they contributed to that wonderful 
period known as the Italian Renaissance, from 



which dates all modem eirilisation. In a broad and 
general sense, the Renaissance has not ended yet ; 
bat in its more limited and customary application 
it stands for the hundred years between the death 
of Giovanni de' Medici — the founder of the great- 
ness of the family (1428) — and the Sack of Rome 
(1527) under the Medicean Pope, Clement VIL 
It was a century of romance and fascination, a 
mingled web of good and ill; and throughout all 
its central figures are seen to be the successive rep- 
resentatives of this Florentine family of merchant 
princes — Giovanni. Cosimo his son, Lorenro his 
great - grandson, and Giovanni, afterwards Pope 
Leo X., his greatrg^reat-gracdson. Had these failed 
to take the deep and absorbing interest they did in 
the movement, it would not have accomplished that 
mission of the intellectual regeneration of Europe 
which it was destined to achieve ; in all probabil- 
ity it would have died down into a mere philo- 
logical " insect-study " of the Greek and Latin 
classics, without effecting that stimulation of life, 
thought, and enterprise of which one of the results 
was the discovery of the " New World." Recent 
investigations and a more critical analysis of their 
policy have tempered on the one hand the indis- 
criminate eulogies of Roscoe. and on the other hand 
have disproved many of the charges brought against 
them by Sismondi and Gino Capponi. Mr. Smeaton 
admits that their crimes were manifold ; that the 
character of even the best of them was all too fre- 
quently stained with the vices of their age to a 
degree reprobated even in that ^;e when moral 
squeamishness was not general. But notwith- 
standing all, he feels that their services to the 
Renaissance cover their multitude of sins. Certainly 
it is cause for gratitude that at last we have a small 
book which describes minutely and consecutively 
the precise nature of these services, and eliminates 
from the tangled web of Florentine politics and 
Florentine history such clear character-studies of 
these makers of the modern time. 



Every traveller in Egypt, every

every antiquarian, has seen a scar- 
abeus. Several works have been published which 
exhibit a large number of these curious old bugs. 
Mr. John Ward, who published ''Pyramids and

Scarabs in Art and History " ( Seribner) . It answers 
the question "What is a scarab ?" in a simple and 
popular manner. We find in the back of the book 
sixteen full-page collotype plates of scarabs, not 
from pen-and-ink drawings as found in earlier 
works, but from elegant well-reproduced photo- 
graphs, giving the exact form and face of the 
originals, which belong to periods stretching from 
the third down to the twenty-fifth dynasty. £^h

A tumptuoug 
art-volume 
about Siena. 



The literary portion of Mr. Gilbert 
Hastings's volume on " Siena, Its 
Architecture and Art " (De La More 
Press, London) is in length not more than an average 
magazine article, — scarcely enough to necessitate 
the index with which it is nevertheless provided. It 
is a nearly square quarto of 55 pages, and is, as it is 
undoubtedly intended to be, a book to delight the 
eyes of the bibliophile, — made so by the choice of 
paper, type, and artistic printing, by photogravures 
and full-page illustrations in half-tone. The plain 
board cover is evidently intended to be replaced by 
the possessor with binding according to his indi- 
vidual taste. As a souvenir of a visit to Siena it is 
also a delight. That the reader may gain informa- 
tion which the letter-press fails to give, and be 
aided to a greater appreciation of the architectural 
and art history of this much-neglected Italian city, 
the book is furnished with a brief bibliography; 
but the greater number of titles given therein are 
of papers which have appeared in the periodical 
press ; and it would seem that a person desirous of 
learning much of Siena would be doomed to disap- 
pointment even after having consulted all that is 
therein indicated. 



Two heroic English kings, Edward 
E.l!THn,.. I- »'>'i H«">'y v., are the subjects of 

recent additions to the "Heroes of 
the Nations " series (Putnam). Both volumes are 
written by trained historians and are authoritative 
accounts in untechnical form of the periods of his- 
tory covered. The volume on Edward, by Mr. 
Edward Jenks, opens with a sketch of the Middle 
Ages in Europe and the Emergence of Modern 
Europe, and then treats of Edward as soldier, 
statesman, and lawgiver. It is a book of value for 
reference or for mature readers, but it will hardly 
attract one who is not making a serious study of the 
history of the period. The life of Henry V. has 
more of general interest, owing to the attractive 
personality of the king, to his brilliant and startling 
successes over a greater and stronger nation, and to 
the gloom of preceding and following reigns. Henry 
was a real hero, and the stripping process to which 
modern writers are subjecting the heroes of old robs 
him of nothing but some traditional stories of a later 
date that were little to his credit. This book also, 
written by Mr. Charles L. Kingsford, is one of per- 
manent value as well as interest. 



Art volume! on ^^^ latest volumes of the " Riverside 
Tutcan tcuipture, Art Series" (Houghton) are on

Dyck." Their general features are similar to those 
of their predecessors, — critical Introduction, Books 
of Reference, Historical Directory, and Biographical 
Data, followed by fifteen pictures with descriptive 
text of two or three pages for each. As a repre- 
sentative selection, the choice in " Tuscan Sculp- 
ture " is open to criticism. Donatello is represented 
by five examples, Luca and Andrea della Robbia by 
three each, and Jacopo della Qaercia by one. This 
is well ; but why should the comparatively minor 
artist Mino da Fiesole have two examples, Nanni 
di Banco and Rosellino each one, while Ghiberti, 
the most epoch-making name of the period, is not 
even mentioned ? Ghiberti's bronze doors for the 
Florence Baptistery are the most remarkable works 
of sculpture finished during the earlier Renaissance ; 
and a book, however elementary, which ignores them 
must be regarded as inadequate. — In the volume 
on Van Dyck the selection is good and representa- 
tive, being divided about equally between portraits 
and subject-pieces. This artist's merits and limi- 
tations are clearly pointed out, and the reasons 
given why, although not ranking among the world's 
foremost masters, Van" Dyck is nevertheless a 
notable and indeed a beloved figure in art history.

that characterized Rufus Choate's splendid eulogy 
delivered from the same platform fifty years ago ; 
but the oration contains a fine summary of the im- 
portant facts in Webster's lite, and expresses what 
must be in the main the judgment of history upon 
him as lawyer, orator, and statesman. In all, he 
is ranked as among the greatest; while in oratory 
he is put at the head of all who have used the En- 
glish language, unless Burke may be allowed to stand 
beside him. The oration was in every way worthy 
of the great occasion that called it forth, and will 
be of permanent value for both its form and its 
content. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



When Professor J. L. Laughlin's " Elements of 
Political Economy " was first published fifteen years 
ago, it was the best text then obtainable for high 
school use. Since then, numerous excellent texts have 
appeared, and it has been subjected to keen competi- 
tion, lu its unrevised condition, it had fallen behind in 
the race for favor, and was getting less representative 
of present day economic theory with every year. Now 
that a new revised edition has been put forth by the 



1902.] 



THE DIAL

American Book Co., it becomes again probably the best 
text for its purposes to be had. Yet the revision has 
not been as thoroughgoing as we could have wished. 
Some of the charts have not been extended to date; 
the old erroneous illustration of the law of diminishing 
returns is repeated; the disingenuous denial of " double 
profits " to oote-issuing national banks Ls restated, and 
the absurdly childish exercises have not been detected. 
Bnt the book is so sound and lucid in its fundamentals 
that we must give it high praise, in spite of these and 
other defects. 

Is it true, as is suggested by Miss Augusta N. 
Campbell Davidson in her " Translations from Lucian " 
(Longmans), that the clear-visioned philosopher of 
Samosata " has fallen at tbe present day almost 
wholly out of general reading "? We are not altogether 
sure of this, although, as a matter of course, Lncian 
does not command the audience of Homer and Virgil, 
or even of Cicero and Plato. At any rate, we may 
welcome and commend to the attention of those who 
know not this most delightful writer the volume that 
Miss Davidson has made. She gives us seven selections 
in all, including "The Sale of the Philosophers," 
" Hermotimxis," " Teus the Tragedian," and the study 
of the false prophet Alexander of Abonotichus. The 
translation reads well and is tbe work of a painstaking 
student. 



XOTKS. 



"Europe," by Mr. Frank G. Carpenter, is a new 
volume of " Carpenter's Geographical Readers," pub- 
lished by the American Book Co. 

"A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales," 
classified by centuries, and compiled by Mr. Jonathan 
Nield, has just been published by the Messrs. Putnam. 

The origin of the old French epic called the "Cov- 
enant Vivien " is the subject of a monograph by Mr. 
Raymond Weeks, published in " The University of 
Missouri Studies." 

A new edition, with an appendix, of Mr. Frederic 
Rowland Marvin's compilation of " Last Words of 
Distinguished Men and Women " is published by the 
Fleming H. Revell Co. 

Mr. William Garrott Brown's semi-philosophical and 
eminently readable " Atlantic Monthly " article on 
« Golf," has been made into a neat booklet by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" The King in Yellow " includes some of the best 
short stories that Mr. R. W. Chambers has ever writ- 
ten, and we note with pleasure the reappearance of tbe 
volume, with illustrations, from the press of the Messrs. 
Harper. 

The first volume of Mr. C. Oman's " History of the 
Peninsular War," which will shortly be issued from 
the Oxford University Press, deals with the events 
from the treaty of Fontainebleau to tbe battle of 
Corunna — 1807-1809. 

Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee has in preparation, for the 
Royal Society of Canada, a bibliography of Canadian 
publications issued during the year 1901. He will be 
very grateful for any information as to books, pam- 
phlets, magazine articles, or papers in society trans- 
actions, published during 1901, by Canadians ; and 
especially would like to be furnished with data as to 



where books and pamphlets were published, the name 
of publisher, number of pages, and size, and in tbe case 
of articles, the month, and page where article begins. 
Mr. Burpee's addzeas is 331 Stewart Street, Ottawa, 
Canada. 

A revised Allen and Greenough's Cioero (Select 
Orations and Letters), prepared by Messrs. J. B. 
Greenough and G. L. Kittredge, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Ginn & Co., with notes, illustrations, 
and a special vocabulary. 

A school reading-book of " Sketches of Great 
Painters for Young People," by Miss Colonna Murray 
Dallin, is published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett, & Co. 
There are twenty-one subjects, each with one or more 
illustrations indifferently reproduced. 

" The Past and Present of Japanese Commeroe," 
by Dr. Yetaro Kinosita, and "The Eastern Question: 
A Study in Diplomacy," by Dr. Stephen Pierce Hayden 
Duggan, are two Columbia University " Studies in 
History, Economics, and Public Law " just sent us by 
the Columbia University Press. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " The Principles 
of Logic," by Dr. Herbert Austin Aikins. Tbe author's 
aim has been to treat deduction, as well as induction, 
from the objective standpoint, and even omits the tra- 
ditional rules of the syllogism. A very valuable set of 
exercises is appended to this text. 

"Tbe Story of tbe Art of Music," by Mr. Fred- 
erick J. Crowest, is published by tbe Messrs. Appleton 
in their " Library of Useful Stories." Opening the 
little book at random, we come upon tbe statement 
that " Tschaikowsky still lives." This is probably not 
typical of the general accuracy of the book, bnt it is 
a quite unpardonable blunder. 

The " Modem Astronomy " of Mr. Herbert H. Turner 
is published in a " second impression " by Messrs. 
£. P. Dutton & Co. It is not a text-book, but rather 
a readable combination of description with narration 
which sets forth the progress made in astronomy during 
the last quarter-century, largely through the application 
to the science of dry plate photography. 

Messrs. Woodward & Lothrop, Washington, are the 
publishers of Mrs. L. W. Maynard's " Birds of Waab- 
ington and Vicinity," which now appears in a revised 
edition, with an introduction by Miss Florence Mer- 
riam Bailey. The same publishers send us the second 
edition of " Esther Burr's Journal," edited by Mr. 
Jeremiah Fames Rankin, and printed in black letter, 
with illustrations. 

Miss Mary E. Burt, who has done so much to help 
children to an understanding of good literature, has 
just edited, with tbe aid of Miss Lucy Cable, an 
abridgment of " Don Quixote de La Mancha," taken 
from tbe translations of Dnffield and Sbelton. The 
book is published by the Messrs. Scribner in their 
« Series of School Beading," and is the eighth volume 
of that series for which Miss Burt is reponsible. 

" True Tales of Birds and Beasts," edited by Pteti- 
dent David Starr Jordan, is published by the Meana. 
Heath in their series of " Home and School Classics." 
The book consists, as the editor says, of " animal 
stories which are true and which are also^good for 
children to read." Among the authors are Thoreau, 
Irving, Mr. Joaquin Miller, and President Jordan him- 
self, who reprints " The Story of a Salmon " from his 
collection of " Science Sketches."

" A fantastic, delightful love-idyl."

W. L. Courtney (Daily Telegraph) :

The New York Sun : "Didn't Elizabeth of the famous 
' Visits ' marry an Earl ? To the best of our recollection 
she did. There is much of the same sort of cleverness in 
this book as in the other. Carlton, who is the author of 
the preface, says: ' I've read every word, and I like it.' 
We agree with Carlton. This particular countess is all 
right."

The Brooklyn Daily Eagle: "An admirable novel. 
We are tempted to compare it with Sarah McLean Greene's 
* Flood-tide,' which it resembles almost as much in its wit 
and rusticity as in its clever construction and healthy moral. 
The story is charmingly told, with plenty of movement and

TEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



Following our cnstom of many years, we 
have prepared, for this and a following num- 
ber of Th£ Dial, a summary of the valuable 
reports upon the European literatures of the 
past twelvemonth, published in " The Athe- 
naeum " for July 5. There are twelve reports 
in all, and we now present, largely condensed, 
the following five : Belgium, by Professor Paul 
Frederioq ; Bohemia, by Dr. V. Tille ; Den- 
mark, by Dr. Alfred Ipsen ; France, by M. 
Jules Pravieux ; and Germany, by Dr. Ernst 
Ueilbom. The remaining seven will be sum- 
marized in a later issue. Sweden and Norway 
are not represented in this year's reports, which 
is a matter for much regret. 

Professor Frederioq opens his Belgian report 
by calling attention to the new Congo litera- 
ture that has arisen of recent years. He then 
proceeds to the consideration of belles-Uttrea in 
the following terms : 

<■ In the field of literature, pure and simple, the Bel- 
gian triamTirate which has migrated to Paris retain* 
its snpremaey; I mean Maeterlinck, Lemonnier, and 
Bodenbach. The last of the three has been taken be- 
fore his time, but he is still alive for us in his drama 
' Le Mirage,' which abounds in his special qualitr of 
refined archness. M. Camille Lemonnier is a coatzaat 
to him in his violence. Brought up at tiM awiTM mt 
Bruges and accused of pornographic tendencies, he has 
revenged himself by his novel ' Les Deux Consciences,' 
in which he confronts a realistic writer with a pious 
magistrate of Bruges. Published first in the ■ Grande 
ilevne ' at Paris, this deep-cut record of passion has 
been very successful. Another novel by M. Lemonnier 
deals also with Belgium, but rural surroundings. ' Le 
Vent dans les Moulins ' exhibits the awakening of the 
Flemish peasants which is due to universal suffrage and 
the birth of the party of Christian democracy. This 
book forms a companion piece to that of M. Cyiiel 
Buysse I noticed last year, ■ A Lion of Flanders,' but in 
ipite of M. Lemonnier's ability his attractive idyl is 
perverted because he does not know the true Flemish 
peasant thoroughly. The last of the trio, M. Maurice 
Maeterlinck, a book from whom is a European event, 
has published this year ' Le Temple Enseveli '; but his 
especial and exquisite surprise for us is his superb 
Italian drama of the fifteenth eenttiry, ' Monna Vanna.' 
I need not speak here at length of two books which all 
the world has read or will read." 

A new and noteworthy literary phenomenon is 
presented by M. Leopold Conrouble's " Famille 



50 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



Kackebroek," a droll novel of Brussels man- 
ners, which we should judge from the descrip- 
tion to be not unlike the popular chronicles of 
the Buchholz Family, which took Berlin by 
storm some fifteen years ago. Among scholarly 
books, mention is made of the Balzac studies 
of M. de Spoelberch de Louvenjoul ; of 
" L'Historie de la Cooperation en Belgique," 
by M. Louis Bertrand ; of " L'Organisation 
du Suffrage Universel en Belgique," by M. 
Leon Dupriez ; and of " L'Evolutionnisme en 
Morale," a critique of the Spencerian philoso- 
phy by M. Jean Halleux. Flemish writings 
include " The Field of Flax," a " really beau- 
tiful poem " by M. Eene de Clercq ; two pretty 
operas ; and village or peasant tales by " Stijn 
Streuvels," M. Herman Teirlinck, and M. Pol 
de Mont. 

Dr. Tille's Bohemian summary says : 

" The greatest stir in social and literary circles was 
caused by Mr. Macbar's < Feuilletons,' a collection of 
reminiscences of the bard life of a student and struggles 
of a literary beginner who, in time, turned out one of 
our prominent authors. He draws here with startling 
truthfulness sketches of persons with whom he had 
intercourse, of the difficulties of a life which often 
troubles and depresses youthful talent, and supplies 
glimpses of bis own mental development." 

In fiction, the author remarks, " a desire pre- 
vails to portray as far as possible the realities 
of life, which is a sign of an honest artistic 
tendency." Among the novels mentioned are 
" With Us," by Mr. Alvis Jerasek ; » Ours," 
by Mr. Holocek ; " Where Do the Children 
Go ? " by Mr. Klostermann ; " The Romance 
of Ivo," by Mr. Sova ; " Rina," by Mr. Kron- 
bauer ; and " Passion and Strength " and 
•' Punishment," two novels of modern social 
life by Mr. Hladik. The following general 
statement is of interest : 

'■ The desire to achieve a specially Bohemian novel 
appears in the younger generation of writers very pal- 
pably, but as yet endeavor is more frequent than 
accomplishment, although many of the results are in- 
teresting enough. The older writers have worked out 
a distinct and comparatively good type of historical 
novel, and have made some creditable attempts at the 
social and conversational novel besides. The latest 
efforts are devoted to the psychological narrative, with 
a social or artistic background." 

Poetry is chiefly represented by the two vet- 
erans, Messrs. Machar and Vrchlicky. The 
former has published " Golgotha," and the lat- 
ter two volumes, " I Let the World Pass by 
Me," and " Cid in the Light of Spanish 
Romance." " Hands," by Mr. Brezina, is a 
collection of poems of mystical or visionary 
tendency. 



" This mysticism is an interesting, but isolated phe- 
nomenon on the Bohemian Parnassus, having created 
for itself a language of its own, full of rich, high-flown, 
almost exalted imagery, which snatches up the reader 
into mystical spheres of a visionary world." 

One dramatic production of the year, Mr. Sim- 
acek's naturalistic play " The Lost Ones," 
caused a great stir among the critics. 

" The author tries to copy real life — that is to say, 
the low everyday life of lost existences — and gives 
details which are the less poetical the truer they are. 
On the stage the play had no success, but the work is 
not abortive in spite of that. The author bad a special 
object in view, and carried it out consistently — to 
bring out the moral misery of a certain class in such 
types as are found ready-made in life." 

Danish literature offers no very striking 
recent developments, although Dr. Ipsen finds 
a number of interesting books upon which to 
report. His own critical study of the work of 
Dr. Georg Brandes is too modestly men- 
tioned at the end of his article, an injustice 
which we now repair by giving it the first 
place in this abstract. A great historical 
trilogy of the sixteenth century in Denmark 
has been written by Herr Johannes Jensen, a 
work in which "there is not an ounce of history 
or study, only a picturesque display of human 
life in its natural strength and colour." Herr 
Johannes Jbrgensen has written two books on 
Italy, " Romerske Masaiker " and " Romerske 
Helgene," dealing with the country not " as the 
cradle of art and the home of beauty, but as 
the home of the Church." " Sejr og Thora," 
by Herr Peder MoUer, is " a big novel in 
which rustic simplicity is contrasted with the 
emptiness and frivolities of the capital, which 
he considers a great centre of moral infection." 
Herr Harald Kidde is " a young and very 
promising man who has written a most beau- 
tiful book, in which he portrays all the tender 
feelings of a refined boy who leaves a lovely 
home to face the rough winds of the world and 
the experiences of life." This book, which is 
to be continued in a second volume, is en- 
titled " Aage og Else," those being the names 
of the hero and heroine. Other works of fic- 
tion are " Gsering," by Herr Jacob Knudsen ; 
" Hjertets Gerninger," by Herr Sven Lange ; 
" Race," by Herr Frederic Poulsen ; " Hallin- 
gerne," by Herr Theodor Ewald. An incur- 
sion into old romance is the poet Herr Ernst 
von der Recke's drama "Det Lukkede Land," 
written in blank verse, and dealing with the 
English tradition of King Arthur and his 
Court, with Guinevere and Lancelot. In lyric 
poetry, there are several meritorious collec- 



1902.]

tions : '• Dansk Tunge,'" by Herr V. Rordam ; 
" Roseme,'" by Herr Aage Mettbison- Hansen ; 
"Sne." by Herr Viggo von Stuckenberg; and 
" Undervejs," by Herr Olaf Hansen, in which 
are found some beautiful verses called "In the 
Town of the Ruins * (Visby, in Gotland), and 
a few songs to Iceland, which is seldom thought 
of in Danish poetry. But the anthor is a con- 
noisseur of its literature and a lover of its 
scenery. 

AI. Jules Pravieux, discussing the condition 
of contemporary French literature, takes ex- 
ception to the current reproach of " anarchy," 
arguing that 

" What is so styled is, as we shall see in the course of 
this HterarT sketch, nothing more than a great Tarietv 
of works and of talent. When we have reviewed the 
dramatic, poetic, philosophic, historic, and sociological 
works, the fiction and books of criticism, which have 
been published since our last review, and which have 
made their mark among the successes of the year, we 
shall arrive, I think, at the following conclusion — that 
there is something better to do than to depreciate and 
reject all that is not fashioned after one particular 
model, and that is to receive with equal eagerness, from 
whatever quarter ther come, by whatever ideal they are 
inspired, those works which offer an original interpre- 
tation of beauty — one perhaps in its essence, but infi- 
nitely varied in its form." 

The drama continues to offer the most note- 
worthy manifestations of French literary art, 
and occupies the first place in our summary. 

" It can be said, without being paradoxical, that at 
perhaps no other epoch has the drama in this country 
produced a greater number of interesting works than 
during the past few years. Never before have so many 
dramatic authors written plays showing such true obser- 
vation or such subtle analysis. But it must at the same 
time be admitted that not one of these plavs is in a 
class by itself, with the exception perhaps of ' L'Enig- 
me,' by M. Paul Hervieu. This piece, which adds vet 
another to the number of great successes at the Commie 
Frangaise, has only two acts, but they are the work of a 
master. If the classic art of all ages be that which 
concentrates the most emotion and thought in the few- 
est words with the greatest clearness, then M. Hervieu 
in ' L'Enigme ' proves himself a pure classic. He re- 
generates in it French art, and in his own way draws 
near to the art of an ^schylos or a Sophocles." 

M. Henri Lavedan, in " Le Marquis de 
Priola, " 

" Finds his inspiration in the great and immortal por- 
trait of Don Juan. How is it that some men whom 
the world in general deems commonplace have the 
wonderful gift of making themselves loved? Whence 
comes the spirit of these men? M. Lavedan, following 
in the footsteps of Moli^re, Musset, and D'Annuniio, 
has taken up this problem, and has made of it a comedy 
of a somewhat harsh and rough character, but interest- 
ing and even powerful. The second act is very im- 
pressive, and through the whole course of the play the 
serious touch of a dramatic writer can be discerned." 



M. Francois de Carel, in " La Fille Sauvage," 
" Has sketched the symbolic legend of Humanity. The 
idea is lofty and beautiful, though, unfortunately, the 
incident chosen to represent it is improbable and out of 
place. The author has attempted to crowd into the 
play, the action of which takes place in a few years, 
the immense psychical evolution of humanity through- 
out the ages. This compression brings about effects 
which are abrupt and not always sublime." 

Other noteworthy plays of the year are 
"L'Archiduc Paul," by M. Abel Hermant; 
" Le Nuage," by M. Gnstave Gaiche ; and 
" La Terre," a dramatization of M. Zola's 
well-known novel. French poetry has been en- 
riched by M. Ary Renan's " Reves d' Artiste," 
M. Albert Samain's " Le Chariot d' Or," M. 
Charles Giierin's " Semeur de Cendres," the 
" Stances " of M. Jean Moreas, and the " Pe- 
tites Legendes " of M. Emile Verhaeren. Bat 
M. Pravieux feels constrained to say : 

" If we are not actually wanting in poets, not one of 
them has produced a work which is irresistible. The 
school which they represent marks a phase in poetic 
evolution, but no single man seems to have talent great 
enough to distinguish that phase by his own name. 
Symbolism remains apparently something more or less 
anonymous. We owe it much, because, partly by in- 
spiration, partly by execution, it has given new life to a 
poetry long concealed by the brilliant rhetoric of Par- 
nassus. But Parnassus has left behind it several defi- 
nite performances, and the symbolists have, perhaps, 
only paved the way for more vigorous spirits." 

M. Paul Bourget beads the list of novelists 
with " Monique," a pathetic story of the work- 
ing classes, and " L'Etape," a more vigorous 
analytical work of high moral scope. M. Paul 
Adam, in " L'Enfant d' Austerlitz," '• has at- 
tempted to portray a whole generation, bat his 
characters are uncertain and even mediocre." 
M. Edouard Estaunie, " whose writings are 
always interesting to the critics," has written 
" L'Epave," which *' is indeed bat a novelette, 
one might almost say a novel with a purpose, 
which proves very little." M. Rod has pub- 
lished '• L'Eau Courante," and 
" Still remains faithful to his favourite form. With a 
few elements of truth and sincere observation of the 
outward facts of life, M. Rod has produced a striking 
picture and an impressive narrative — in a word, a fine 
work. The scope of the book oversteps the bounds of 
convention to which the author should have confined it, 
but it bears that stamp of general truth which estab- 
lishes both works and reputations." 

M. Jules Claretie's " Le Sang Fran^ais " is 
" the work of a true patriot, and in the stories 
of the Franco-German war he recalls to our mind 
certain passages of Daudet on the siege of 
Paris, but in his historical chapters it reaches 
a still higher level." MM. Paul and Victor 
Margueritte in " Braves Gens " write of the

war of 1870 with power and truth, although 
the story is more history than romance. 

" M. Rend Bazin, ia • Les Oberld,' has not written an 
historical romance ; but though the romantic tendency 
predominates in it, it has another side which has made 
it a success. In ' Les Oberld * the Alsace-Lorraine 
question is admirably treated. This searching study 
affords excellent material for the development of char- 
acter. The style of the writing is really charming, a 
style through which can be seen the heart of things, and 
in which the great talent of the writer appears full of 
delicacy, grace, deep emotion, and sure psychology, with 
a healthy, deep, and elevated poetic instinct." 

Turning: to the historical field, we find the 
usual abundance of literature concerning the 
Kevolution and the First Empire. Here may 
be mentioned in particular M. Aulard's " His- 
toire Politique de la Kevolution Fran^aise " 
and " Etudes et Lemons sur la Revolution 
Fran^aise," M. Funck-Brentano's " L' Affaire 
du Collier," and M. Arthur Levy's " Napoleon 
et la Paix." The Second Empire also comes 
in for its share of attention, the " Memoires 
du Comte de Reiset " being the most important 
publication for this period. Of historical 
writing in general we are told : 

" There seems to be a veritable passion for recon- 
structing the past; public and private records are 
searched with indefatigable sagacity. Taine has in 
France a few devoted disciples who have taken to his 
method, and divested it of the somewhat systematic 
character which often distinguished the works of the 
author of ' Origines de la France Contemporaine,' and 
it can be said that many of the historical productions of 
the year have not fallen far short of perfection. All 
our historians abstain from generalities, and leave phi- 
losophy to be dealt with by books devoted to it — what 
they endeavor to obtain and what they publish is fact, 
documentary fact. If this zeal does not abate, and 
there is every reason to believe that it will not, the 
twentieth century will, by its historical publications, 
reform many current opinions." 

M. Alfred Fouillee is the author of " La Re- 
forme de I'Enseignement par la Philosophie," 
an important educational work. The author 
" Considers that all teaching should be supplemented 
and quickened by philosophy — that philosophy should 
have a large part in all education; but the philosophy 
for which he asks is social philosophy, which concerns 
itself with great problems of morality and sociology." 

A work not far from the same category is M. 
Ossip-Lourie's " La Philosophie Sociale dans 
le Theatre d'Ibsen." This writer evidently is 
one of the few who really understand the great 
Norwegian, as the following statement of Dr. 
Ibsen's philosophy will attest : 

" To his mind society is in au ill state, it rests on 
hypocritical conventions, on lies, but he believes in the 
goodness of human nature — its goodness, that is to 
say, in so far that, if it is left to itself, its ills and vices 
will disappear. In this Ibsen shows himself Utopian, 



forgetting the true conditions of human nature in 
his dreams of an unattainable perfection. M. Ossip- 
Louri^, whole-hearted in his admiration, can only see 
in the plays of the Norwegian dramatist great and 
powerful lessons set out with a courageous candor." 

M. Fouillee has also written a book on 
" La Philosophie Russe Contemporaine," in 
which " he asserts that though Russian thought 
is readily revolutionary as a reaction against 
excessive despotism, it has by temperament a 
moral tendency. What is the aim of life ? 
How shall we order our lives ? That is the 
mighty problem it brings forward, therein lie 
its originality and power." Other books on 
social philosophy are M. Fourniere's " Essai 
sur r Individualisme," M. Bourdeau's "L'Ev- 
olution du Socialisme," and M. Halevy's » La 
Formation du Radicalisme Philosophique — 
La Jeunesse du Bentham." Among works of 
criticism, the following may be mentioned : 
" La Formation du Style par 1' Assimilation 
des Auteurs," by M. Albalat ; " La Littera- 
ture d'Aujourd'hui," by M. Ernest Charles ; 
" Stendhal- Beyle," by M. Arthur Chuquet; 
and " LePretre dans le Roman Fran9ais," by 
M. Paul Franche. 

Dr. Heilborn's account of German litera- 
ture opens with these reflections : 

" In literature, as in other things, there are years 
of fruitful harvest alternating with years of scarcity, 
and our granaries in Germany are this time some- 
what poorly filled. Almost all our better-known au- 
thors have come before the public with new works, but 
what they have offered has proved of comparatively 
small consequence either for their own artistic devel- 
opment or for literature in general. And now we see 
a strange phenomenon asserting itself. As though 
literature were an organism, in which if one limb or 
organ fails another develops with double vigour, in 
precisely the same way writers hitherto overlooked or 
little known have this year come forward with pro- 
ductions which engage deep and serious attention and 
should give new impulses to literature." 

Beginning with the stage, and specifically with 
Herr Sudermann's "Es Lebe das Leben," he 
says that this play 

"Shows with terrible clearness how greatly abilities 
even of a high order are crippled by the want of con- 
stant spiritual development. The drama has adultery 
for its theme, adultery committed years before; and in 
order to set the stone a-rolling Herr Sudermann has 
supplied a profusion of forced and insufficient motives 
which necessarily hamper the ease and smoothness of 
the dialogue. ... It is not only a poor drama, it is also 
immoral at the core; and it is interesting to observe 
how Herr Sudermann, the virtuoso — what with the 
confusion of his subject-matter and the perfunctory 
character of his mental operations — has also lost the 
great technical dexterity which he has hitherto shown." 

In " Ueber den Wassern," Herr Georg Engel 
" Obtains a purely superficial excitement by making a

flood barst in apon a fishing- -village and swamp H. The 
onlr persons saved are the inmates of the clergyman's 
boose, and their lives, too, are threatened bv the waters. 
Face to face with death, a fanatical voung clergrman 
baa enjoined on bim the task of reclaiming a girl and 
bringing her to repentance, but he refuses to do this, 
on the ground that her sin is too execrable; finallv, 
however, he does speak to her, and touches her cod- 
scienoe, but he declares that repentance alone would be 
ineffectual to expiate her offence. She must seek death 
in the service of others. This she accordingly does for 
his sake." 

Herr Max Halbe's " Haus Rosenhagen '" has 
for its theme 

"The desire for the acquisition of land — a desire 
which has been inherited for generations by a family of 
wealthy proprietors, and which they have indalged at 
the expense of their weaker neighbors. The son of the 
house is about to enter, literally and in spirit, upon the 
inheritance of his fathers; the passion which possessed 
tbem is to blaze up in him; the enmity which they have 
sown is to bear him strange fruit. Halbe, however, has 
not succeeded in maintaining the situation consistently 
to its conclusion." 

Herr Paul Liudau, in " Nacht und Morgen " 
supplies '• that peculiar combination of the 
drama of adultery with the romance of the 
police-court which he has learnt from Sardou." 
The fairy drama has become the fashion, and 
is illustrated by several pieces, the most note- 
worthy of which is " Der Weg znm Licht," by 
Herr Georg Hirschfeld. The greatest popular 
theatrical success of the year has been scored 
by Herr Meyer- Forster with "Alt-Heidelberg,"' 
which is a dramatization of his own lisht ro- 
mance " Carl Heinrich."' Herr Hauptmann's 
new play, »* Der Rothe Hahn.'* links itself 
with the earlier '* Biberpelz," and as a work of 
art '• can lay claim to no great merit. It is 
interesting because it testifies to the inner de- 
velopment of a serious and strenuous artist 
upon whom the spiritual tendencies of the age, 
intangible and hard of interpretation as they 
are, have not been lost." Perhaps the most 
promising dramatic work of the year has been 
the series of "Lebendige Stunden '" — one-act 
plays by Herr Arthur Schnitzler. 

" He has proved two things in these new one-act 
plays of his: that he draws his creations from his own 
mental experience, and that he is, at the same time, 
capable of mastering his impressions and regarding 
them objectively — both prime requisites, it seems to 
me, in all true art." 

Pasing lightly over the insignificant output of 
the year's verse. Dr. Heilborn turns to fiction 
as "the power which determines our artistic 
aims and the development of our literature." 
He first enumerates a few works of lesser im- 
portance — "Felix Notvest," by Herr J. C. 
Heer ; " Unter der Geissel," bv Herr von Wil- 



denbruch ; " Ninon und Andere Erzahlungen," 
by Herr Paul Heyse : " Ein Mecklenburger," 
by Herr Adolf Wilbrandt ; and " Cacilie von 
Sarryn,' by Herr Georg von Ompteda — and 
then turns for more extended comment to " the 
three books of the year — the books which 
have in very truth given our recent literature 
its individual stamp, and which afford some- 
thing like repose after a long pilgrimage 
through the book market. In these three books 
outward events and circumstances sink into 
insignificance beside what is purely psycholog- 
ical. All three have been written by authors 
hitherto little known." The first of these books 
is by Fran Riccarda Huch, and is called " Aus 
der Triumphgasse.'" It pictures the lives of 
the poor and the vile in a series of sketches 
that are redeemed from the charge of being 
merely sordid by a vein of romantic idealism. 
" Yet the last word is not spoken by romanticism 
either; a new transformation sets in. We begin to see 
the souls of these people as they originally came forth 
from the hand of God; memories from some former 
state of existence stir and rise up within us — we sur- 
mise dimly that they will return to the hand of their 
Creator in pristine purity when once the breath of life 
has left them. For the soul retains its majesty in all 
the degradations of life. And, indeed, this is the true 
action of the book, that all masks and disguises are 
stripped off, and souls reveal themselves as souls. 
Behind the phantasmagoria of life stand the eternal 
forms." 

" Freund Hein," by Herr Emil Strauss, is a 
simple story of a boy whose " soul lives wholly 
in music." The discord between his outer and 
inner life makes existence intolerable to him, 
and he makes an end of it. 

" But it is, indeed, as a true friend that Death pre- 
sents himself; the eraving of the soul for repose has 
become all-powerfal. And so in this novel, too, the 
claims of the spirit are higher than those of life, and 
since the c&se stands thus. Death loses all his terrors." 

The third of these books is " Jorn Uhl," by 
Herr Gustav Frenssen, a Protestant pastor of 
Holstein. It presents the Christian conception 
of life with great force and pathos and shows 
how the soul grows strong through suffering. 
Thinking of this novel, says the writer, 
" I see stretched before my eyes the broad and fruit- 
ful lands of German soil, inhabited by a resolute and 
vigorous race, and I say to myself that this soil will 
bear fruit in the future, even as it has in the past — 
fruit of many kinds." 

Unlike the other contributors to this conspec- 
tus of Continental literature, Dr. Heilborn 
leaves scholarly writing wholly out of his ac- 
count, confining his observations almost solely 
to the two departments of fiction and the liter- 
ature of the stage.

Reminiscences op Twenty Years.* 

Charming as is the genial temper that pre- 
supposes one's readers interested in all one's 
personal experiences, a little practice in the 
use of the blue pencil is apt to produce results 
more generally satisfactory to the busy reading 
public. The difference between the trained 
professional journalist and the non-professional 
diarist is well illustrated by the volume of rem- 
iniscences noticed at some length in the pre- 
ceding issue of The Dial, and the far bulkier 
collection now under review. From a literary 
point of view, the non-professional writer suf- 
fers by the comparison. 

Lord Ronald Sutherland Gower is too well 
known as a sculptor, a fine-art critic, a trav- 
eller, and a writer of occasional books, to need 
formal introduction. His volume of reminis- 
cences published twenty years ago established 
his reputation as a pleasing raconteur. The 
present collection forms a sequel to the earlier 
work. The beaten roads of European travel 
are all familiar to him, and he seems to have 
hobnobbed with royalty and chatted with prime 
ministers wherever he went. His avuncular 
relation to the Duke of Argyll puts him on 
terms of some intimacy with the English royal 
family. The earlier chapters of his book con- 
tain frequent references to his work in Paris 
on the Shakespeare monument that was soon 
to be erected at Stratford-on-Avon. This is his 
account of its unveiling in the fall of 1888 : 

"The Great Day has come and passed — that of 
last Wednesday, 10th October, when my Monument of 
Shakespeare was unveiled at Stratford-on-Avon. On 
that morning Sir Arthur Hodgson and I met George 
Augustus Sala at the station, who might truly have 
been called the guest of the occasion and of the day, 
and I shall always feel grateful to him for having 
taken the trouble to leave London at seven on a cold, 
raw, foggy morning, in order to take part in the 
function relating to my Shakespearian Monument. He 
appeared in his famous Astracan-lined greatcoat, and 
with his speech ready written out, which he gave to 
the correspondent of a local newspaper, who was await- 
ing him on the platform. There also came by the same 
train a lively little American lady, Miss "Wakeman, 
who is correspondent for half-a-dozen American papers. 
A little before twelve, we drove down into Stratford 
from Clopton. The company met in the Memorial 
Library, Lord Leigh and Sidney Propert among them. 
Volunteers lined the road, from the entrance up to the 
Monument, covered with Union Jacks. We formed a

semicircle around it. The Mayor — Sir Arthur — led 
off by a most laudatory oration. After this I called on 
Lady Hodgson to unveil the Monument, which was 
accomplished without difficulty, and a loud and ap- 
proving cheer greeted the appearance of Shakespeare, 
which looked well in the soft sunshine which seemed 
to bathe it in a kindly benison of light and life. The 
Volunteer baud struck up ' Warwickshire's Lads and 
Lasses,' and the bells pealed from Shakespeare's Church 
tower. I felt very grateful and very glad to have, by 
God's good grace, been allowed to see the end and 
completion of my long labour, and to know that it was 
approved of by so many. A big luncheon followed in 
the Picture Gallery, followed by much speechifying. 
George Augustus Sala spoke admirably, with great 
effect, and even pathos, and I felt a lump in my throat 
during his peroration." 

Six full-page views are given of the monument 
as a whole and of its details. 

The following reference to an interview with 
Cardinal Newman is worth quoting : 

"The Cardinal soon appeared, preceded by a priest, 
who at once retired, leaving us alone. We sat cheek by 
jowl, he laying bis beretta on a plain table by his side. 
The Cardinal wore a scarlet skull-cap, a black, gown-like 
dress, with a crimson sash round the waist. I stayed 
about half-an-hour. The most interesting subject he 
spoke about referred to his hymn, ' Lead Kindly Light,' ^ 
which he said he had composed on board ship during a 
calm between Sardinia and Corsica. That hymn, he 
said, was not his feeling now, ' for we Catholics,' he 
said with a kind smile, ' believe that we have found the 
light.' ... I shall never forget his kind look as he 
wished me farewell and thanked me for having come to 
see him." 

As the book is more interesting than any- 
thino- that can be said about it, it will be per- 
missible to quote further passages. A visit to 
the Bismarck family at Kissingen in the sum- 
mer of 1890 is well described. 

" The Prince spoke to me in English very well, if 
not fluently; he pronounces some words oddly, for in- 
stance, a word which he used constantly, ' especially ' 
which he pronounced ' espeecially.' I got him to speak 
about himself, the most interesting subject to hear him 
talk about. He alluded to his twenty-eight years of in- 
cessant work, and of the anxiety of those years. They 
had quite obliterated for him, he said, the things he 
cared most for previously, riding and shooting, and he 
added, music and painting; but especially riding, he 
said again, of which he was once passionately fond; 
now he only regarded it as a healthy exercise, and no 
longer delighted as of yore in his horses. The tremen- 
dous work he had to go through had, he said, driven 
all these things away from him; bis work had been like 
gambling on a vast scale, and the stakes the prosperity 
if not the very existence of his country. Other minis- 
ters were, he said, content with holding their portfolios, 
but he had all the state work on his shoulders. The old 
King (' King ' he always called him, and never Emperor) 
had often said laughingly to him, ' I would not be in 
your skin for all the world.' He then told me in a some- 
what involved manner an anecdote of General York, 
whose desertion from Prussia to Russia had had such 
an effect upon the deserter that his hair blanched in a

single night, ' and I,' said the Prince, ■ hare had not only 
one such night as that, but dozens.' He spoke of the 
old Emperor with more esteem than admiration, ' a 
grand soldier,' he called him, and ■ a most gentleman- 
like old man,' bat not remarkable as a statesman. . . . 
' I was,' said Bismarck, ' probably the only person who 
saw the old King en robe de chambre, when I was sent 
for by him late at night '; and he described what a 
change it made in the appearance of the venerable 
monarch to be minus bis wig and his ratelier, for the 
white locks which appeared on his head in the daytime 
were fastened to bands. Latterly he was quite bald." 

Lord Sutherland Gower eujoyed the friend- 
ship of Herbert Bismarck. Meeting him in 
Switzerland in the summer of 1892, when the 
Count was on his wedding tour, he notes that 
the newly married man was glad of the sight 
of an old friend. " I think," he adds, " honey- 
mooning people generally are pleased to see a 
friend during the period when they try hard to 
imagine themselves thoroughly happy." The 
author's first experience with an automobile, in 
Paris, in 1891, furnishes the substance of a 
rather curious entry in his diary. 

" One day that July in Paris I had my first expe- 
rience of a steam-motor car. An engineer named Ser- 
palet came to the entrance of my hotel, with a steam 
carriage that he has invented, which be calls a ' steam 
phaeton.' It is worked by steam and runs on three 
wheels. Six people can be seated in this carriage; 
the boiler is at the back. We went up the Champs 
Elys^es, and into the Bois at a good pace, rather sur- 
prising but not alarming the horses when passing them. 
The carriage can be turned with ease, and can be slowed 
down, or stopped without difficulty; but whether this 
will be a gain to locomotion is doubtful ; it was De Les- 
seps who recommended me to see this new invention." 

Meeting the King of Italy and the Prince 
of Naples at Palermo, in the same year, he has 
this to say of them : 

" His Majesty was most affable, he asked a quantity 
of questions, and seemed in no hurry to proceed farther 
np the room. The King is only forty-seven, but he 
looks sixty; he speaks in short sentences and rapidly; 
there is a decided charm about his manner, and one 
feels in the presence of an honest man, a Itomme de 
cceur (not de cour), as be has always proved iiimself to 
be. He said that after being absent from Palermo ten 
years, he found many changes, old friends dead, and 
others grown old, and that it was not an easy thing to 
recollect those he had known on former occasions here. 
After His Majesty had finished speaking with me I 
was introduced by General Pallavicini to the Prince of 
Naples, a very short little youth, with a weak mouth 
and retreating chin, but with a pleasing manner. The 
Prince speaks English as if it were his native tongue." 

A " breakfast " at Marlborough House in 
1893, " to meet Her Majesty," gives us a char- 
acteristic glimpse of Gladstone. 

" The G. O. M. was in great form, looking wonder- 
fully hale, strong, and stouter in the face than he did a 
year or two ago, all the ' sturm und drang ' that he has 
had to go through seems to have augmented his mar- 



vellous intellect and physiqne. Oar host drew him oat 
on a variety of subjects, and we beard him discourse 
on the Welsh language, on the definition of the term 
' bore,' for which there is no word in French, as he 
pointed ont, and on a hundred other subjects. Oar 
dinner lasted from soon after eight till past ten-thirty, 
when Mr. Gladstone rose to drive off to Dollis Hill." 

Cliveden, our author's old home, now owned 
by Mr. Astor, is thus referred to : 

" Early in June [1895] I paid Mr. Astor a visit at 
my old home, Cliveden, where I had not been for a very 
long time. To revisit that place where so many years 
of my early life had passed (chequered with much sad- 
ness in later years, when my sister Constance passed 
there the last summer of her life), was, of course, full 
of sadness; but I wished to see with my own eyes what 
Astor had actually done to the place; and I found, as 
I had expected, that all the accounts of his having dis- 
figured the place, were lies. He has certainly built an 
ugly wall, with glass on the top, along the roadside be- 
tween the two lodges, bat except for that no walls had 
been added or boilt 'all round the place,' as reported; 
and in removing the ugly yellow wing which West- 
minster built in the place of the old one, which has now 
been rebuilt to correspond, as formerly, with its fellow, 
an improvement has been effected. Within, little ia 
changed, although the entrance-hall is to be altered; 
everything is respected and cared for." 

Not the least pleasing feature of this book 
is its excellent index, a most useful adjunct to 
such a collection of odds and (mds. The illus- 
trations, fifteen in number, are also good. But 
a little more attention to the irksome details of 
manuscript revision would have improved the 
noble lord's entertaining volume. One brief 
reference of his to " Count Stolberg Wem- 
gerode, whom Herbert Bismarck told me is the 
owner of the famous Broken Mountain in the 
Hartz Mountains," contains a threefold illus- 
tration of the unhappy results of neglect in this 
particular. Those however who share Edward 
FitzGerald's dislike for the " ambition of fine 
writing " will welcome the volume all the more 
cordially for its unstudied dress and its spon- 
taneity of style. Percy F. Bicknell.

country, have in their turn done much to arouse 
interest in the study and preservation of family 
records, antiquities, and all other memorials of 
our ancestors. Such interest must be the in- 
evitable result of volumes like the one before us. 

The life of Philip Freneau, as told by Miss 
Austin, is an interesting story. The outlines 
of his life have been set forth several times 
already ; fifteen authors, it is stated in the 
preface, have written upon the subject. Miss 
Austin has had the advantage over all of them, 
however, in having the use of " some unex- 
pected data in the form of notebooks and mar- 
ginal notes," which " have thrown light upon 
some hitherto unaccounted-for years in the 
poet's life, and have served to link together 
the portions already given to the public, as 
well as to correct many misstatements." In the 
first fifty pages of the book — a large part, 
some will say — are set forth the effect of the 
revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the con- 
sequent Huguenot emigration ; followed by a 
description of New Amsterdam and early New 
York, and an account of the early Huguenot 
settlement there. Fortunate indeed for the city 
was the coming of these thrifty and pious set- 
tlers. In the little Eglise du St. Esprit, at the 
corner of King and Nassau Streets, worshipped 
the ancestors of some of our foremost citizens. 
To quote the words of Dr. Vermilye (Huguenot 
Sqc. Proc, i. 26): 

"They were the yeast in the Dutch cake. They 
were inventive; skilled in various workmanship; per- 
sistent in overcoming difficulties; of a sprightly cheer- 
fulness and an instinctive gentility. They were edu- 
cated — had even founded a college for themselves in 
Leyden. They were religious; whom [sic] fierce winds 
of persecution had torn from the native tree, only to 
sprout again, the same religious people, wherever they 
touched ground. It was a good and hardy stock." 

These words suffice to indicate the general 
character of Philip Freneau's ancestors. His 
grandfather, Andre Fresueau, who settled in 
New York in 1707, was engaged in the ship- 
ping and foreign trade, and was a prominent 
resident of lower Broadway, in his day an 
aristocratic part of the city. Miss Austin's 
account of his children, by the way, is any- 
thing but clear. Who are Thomas, Louis, and 
Francois (p. 63)? We can only infer that they 
were brothers of Pierre and Andre junior, and 
uncles of Philip, the poet. If this is true, the 
customary statement that Pierre had but one 
brother, Andre, is of course inaccurate. Of 
the business and character of Pierre (who, say 
Duyckinck and others, was a wine-merchant 
like his brother Andre), we learn nothing what- 



ever. The poet himself, the eldest of five chil- 
dren, first saw the light in Frankfort Street, 
New York, on January 2 (O. S.), 1752 ; but 
before the year was over his father had re- 
moved to the estate in Monmouth County, 
New Jersey, where the boy's early years were 
passed. 

Philip was doubtless precocious ; and we 
may well believe that, possessing the advan- 
tages of refined surroundings and a careful 
training, he began to write when very young. 
But we cannot suppose, as Miss Austin ap- 
parently does (p. 70), that " The Wild Honey- 
suckle " (which Professor Bronson rightly pro- 
nounces " the high-water mark of American 
poetry of the eighteenth century ") was the 
work of a mere boy. No tyro, we think, could 

write, 

"They died — nor were those flowers more gay, 
The flowers that did in Eden bloom." 

We have only to compare this piece with the 
poems which are known to have been Freneau's 
early work — "Discovery," "Columbus to 
Ferdinand," " Eetirement," " The Dying Elm," 
and others — to see the advance he had made 
in freeing himself from conventional and arti- 
ficial forms of expression. It is to be remem- 
bered, too, that these verses are not to be found 
in the first collection of his poems, published 
in 1786. 

The college life at Nassau Hall, Princeton, 
in the days when Freneau was a student there, — 
rooming with James Madison, destined to be 
the fourth President, — is described as fully, 
probably, as the materials will permit. The 
rising bell rang at five o'clock and a half-hour 
was allowed for dressing, after which came 
prayers ; but from these the small boys were 
excused in winter. Breakfast came at eight ; 
recitations, from nine till one ; then all dined 
together, at three tables. From three to five, 
more study ; then evenmg prayers, and supper 
at seven. At nine the bell rang for study. 
" After nine any might go to bed, but to go 
before was reproachful." On Sunday every 
student, unless sick, was required to attend 
public worship, both morning and afternoon. 
In spite of this rigorous training, however, 
there were occasional delinquencies. Philip 
Fithian writes to his father (January 13,1772): 

" I am sorry that I may inform you, that two of our 
Members were expelled from the College yesterday; 
not for Drunkenness, nor Fighting, nor for Swearing, 
nor Sabbath-Breaking; But they were sent from this 
Seminary, where the greatest Pains and Care are taken 
to cultivate and encourage Decency, & Honesty, & 
Honour, for stealing Hens! Shameful, mean, unmanly 
Conduct! "

Liberal doses of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, 
logic, and moral philosophy were administered ; 
yet along with these Freneau found time for 
reading and for much writing of verse, some 
of which certainly possesses great merit. At 
his graduation in 1771, he presented by proxy 
an argument showing •' that ancient poetry ex- 
cels the modern." President Witherspoon was 
a loyal patriot, and his students were not slow 
in expressing their indignation at the imposi- 
tions heaped upon the colonists. In these col- 
lege years. Freneau received the vocation which 
was to earn for him the well-deserved title 
of '• the Patriot Poet of the Revolution." His 
pen became " his bayonet, and its wounds were 
mortal." 

Ttie Revolutionary years are well set forth. 
At times, possibly, the author draws too largely 
upon her imagination ; and she sometimes (&s 
on page 123) turns almost abruptly from the 
most stirring scenes to narrate some bit of 
family history, relatively unimportant ; indeed 
her excursions into the genealogy of the Provost, 
Ledyard, Scott, and other families, while en- 
tertaining, do not add to our knowledge of the 
poet Freneau or of the events which inspired 
his poems, and therefore really mar the unity 
of the book. But she has made skilful use of 
the scanty materials at her disposal, and has 
woven a lively and. in the main, doubtless, a 
reliable narrative of Freneau's operations during 
the struggle with England. 

And a busy, stirring life it was. Sailor, 
traveller in the West Indies, privateer, playing 
" sad havoc with the English merchantmen "; 
captive on board " The Scorpion " and " The 
Hunter"; his pen ever busy with those terrible 
satires which revealed such intense hatred of 
foreign misrule of a proud-spirited people. 
King "Log," "the Xero of our times"; "the 
ruffian Gage "; Cornwallis, " hatched by some 
demon on a stormy day "; Bute and North, 
" twin sons of hell," — all came in for a share of 
his lively and withering ridicule. Perhaps there 
is no more remarkable collection of its kind in 
existence than Freneau's " Poems Relating to 
the American Revolution," which Duyckinck 
edited in 1865. The influence his verses must 
have exerted on the disheartened patriots is 
incalculable. 

■■ From Concord to Yorktown, during the bleak winter 
at Vallej Forge, and round the camp-fires on Temple 
Hill, his verses encouraged the desponding soldiers. 
The newspapers widely published them, and they were 
written on slips of paper and distributed throughout 
the army, or pasted in some conspicuous place to be 
memorized. And not alone by the camp-fire did they 



accomplish their work, but even on the field; his ear- 
nestness and zeal encouraged the patriots to greater 
efforts, or urged them on at the point of his l»yooet 
(tlw pen) when he saw any signs of their lagging be- 
hind; and afterwards be immortalized the victoriea 
they won. Not a memorable incident either by land 
or by water escaped his ever watchful and unwearied 
pen." 

The war over, Freneau's muse continued to 
j be active, but brooded often on more peaceful 
j themes. In 1787, for example, he contributed 
I no fewer than twelve poems to " The American 
: Museum," among them " The Death Song of a 
Cherokee Indian," " To the Memory of Col. 
I John Laurens," and " Lines Occasioned by a 
Visit to an Old Indian Burying Ground." 
Notwithstanding frequent mercantile voyages 
to the West Indies, " Captain " Freneau found 
time to prepare and publish (1786-88) two 
volumes of poems, essays, and tales. After- 
ward, giving up the sea, he turned to journalism. 
The true position of " The National Gazette " 
was first clearly explained in 1895 by the late 
Paul Leicest«r"Ford (" The Nation," Ix. 143). 
Doubtless Jefferson told the truth when in his 
letter to Washington he protested that he never 
influenced Freneau nor wrote for "The Gazette," 
and it is hard not to accept Freneau's affida- 
vit of August 8, 1792 ; but, as Mr. Ford con- 
clusively shows, they could not have told the 
whole truth. Not merely was " The Gazette " to 
fnmish " a juster view of the affairs of Europe 
than could be obtained from any other public 
source "; it was, in reality, also to serve as a 
partisan organ for the Republicans. It amply 
fulfilled its mission ; its bitter animosity to the 
administration caused Washington great an- 
noyance, while in the view of Jefferson and his 
followers it " saved the Constitution, which was 
fast galloping into monarchy." It is hard for 
us, even in these days of Philippine disputes, 
to comprehend the extremes to which men were 
then carried by partisan feeling ; yet, after all, 
milder editorials from the author of " Mac- 
Swiggen " and "The British Prison Ship" 
would have surprised us. 

At the early age of forty-one, Freneau re- 
tired to his estate at Mount Pleasant, where 
he was to spend the second half of his life 
in seclusion. Of this period of his life we 
have few records, much having perished in 
the disastrous fire of October 18, 1818. We 
know that he wrote much poetry, and put out 
three more editions of it (1797, 1809, 1815); 
that he dabbled in journalism and made 
almanacs ; that he again turned to the sea and 
made many voyages to the West Indies ; that

he entertained many old friends, visited much 
in New York and Philadelphia, and conducted 
a large correspondence. In the main, he lived 
the peaceful life of a country gentleman, bear- 
ing malice toward none, beloved by many and 
respected by all. 

Miss Austin prudently refrains from express- 
ing critical judgments of Freneau's poetry, 
quoting freely instead from Dr. Francis and 
Mr. Delaneey ; and we shall not prolong this 
notice with critical remarks, since to what 
these writers and Professor Tyler have said 
little can be added. Freneau's fame is secure. 
The greatest and most versatile of the Revo- 
lutionary group, the greatest American poet 
before Bryant, he has written some lines that 
have never been surpassed. His best verses 
are still read, and will long continue to give 
delight. A new edition of his poetry, edited 
by Professor Pattee, has been announced for 
publication this year, to which Miss Austin's 
sumptuous volume will form a worthy com- 
panion. She has made the poet and his times 
live again for us ; and this is the test of a 
successful biography, q^ark S. Northup. 



RECOIiliECTIONS OF THE AMERICAN 

Stage.* 



In " Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic," 
Mr. Henry Austin Clapp, who is recognized by 
some as the leading exponent in New England 
of honest and discriminating criticism of the 
drama, reviews some of the chief features of 
the stage during the past quarter of a century. 
These reminiscences, however, are not exhaust- 
ive in any sense of the word, and do not pro- 
fess to present the history of the theatre in the 
United States during the period mentioned. 
He has chronicled, merely, those recollections 
which have remained most vivid in his mem- 
ory, in a manner that will elicit praise from 
many and censure from a few. 

The author calls attention to the fact that 
of the large body of English playwrights who 
produced dramas, " always with extreme facil- 
ity and sometimes with contemporaneous suc- 
cess," between 1845 and 1875, — excepting, of 
course. Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, — every 
man but T. W. Robertson is to-day practically 
obsolete. 

"The deeper reasons of the law of the survival of 
dramas may not be laid down here and now, but a good

negative working-day rule of prediction can be fur- 
nished. It seems to be a part of the present order of 
things, at least in English-speaking countries, that our 
dramas shall be ephemeral. Even the best of them are 
like insects, made to flaunt their little wings for a few 
hours in the sunshine of popular favor. The caprice of 
fashion deals out death with relentless speed to these 
plays. That they furnish the public with much enter- 
tainment is not to be questioned ; but they have no 
essential beauty, or imposing breadth, or prevailing 
power to make their appeal potent beyond a year or 
less of life. ' The best of this kind are but shadows,' 
said the Dramatist of the World, in one of his remark- 
able expressions about the art of which he was Prime 
Minister and Master. The rule of negative prediction 
is simple enough: The play which never passes into 
literature; the play which, in 'the cold supremacy of 
print,' cannot endure reading and re-reading has the 
sure seed of death within it. Out of a hundred con- 
temporary dramas, ninety are fiat and unprofitable on 
a first perusal, and ninety-and-nine are warranted to 
cause mental nausea at a second. Take Robertson's 
' School,' for instance, which was performed to hun- 
dreds of thousands of delighted spectators, in England 
and America, in the early seventies. Reading it delib- 
erately to-day is like absorbing a gallon of weak eau 
sucree flavored with the juice of half a lemon and a 
small pinch of ginger. Contrast with that work, and 
work of its quality, the half a hundred tragedies and 
comedies which remain to us from the Greeks of the 
fifth and fourth centuries before Christ. The newest 
of these plays are two thousand two hundred years old; 
they are written in a dead language; and they have the 
atmosphere of a remote land and an alien age and civ- 
ilization; yet they still receive the quick sympathy and 
command the reverent admiration of the world. The 
corollary of the rule for negative prediction is obvious: 
The nation which is producing no readable dramatic 
literature is producing no dramas of permanent impor- 
tance from the point of view of life and art, which are 
indeed one point and the same." 

During Mr. Clapp's thirty years' service as 
a dramatic critic, many truly great actors have 
made their final exit. In his book the personal 
gossip and anecdote which generally lends zest 
and piquancy to such narratives are missing. 
The author explains that he has, in the inter- 
ests of candid criticism, avoided personal ac- 
quaintance with player folk, that his head 
"might neither be quite turned, nor much 
deflected from a true level." His Reminiscen- 
ces take form as a series of reconsiderations of 
the plays and players of the past, from the 
point of view of a disinterested critic. The 
first on his canvas is that veteran figure of the 
Boston Museum, William Warren. When his 
seventieth birthday was celebrated, a little 
while before the close of his professional career, 
the tale of this wonderful actor's work was 
told : he had given 13,345 performances, and 
had appeared in 577 characters ! For many 
years he was a most interesting figure in Bos- 
ton, not only upon the stage, but upon the

streets over which he took his deliberate and 
slightly varied walks. 

" His tall, large, well-formed figure, and his easy, 
rather peculiar gait, which seemed alwavs about to be- 
come, but never quite became, a roll or swagger; his 
noble head with the bright penetrating eyes and the ex- 
traordinary sensitive mouth, made equally to utter 
mirth or pathos or wisdom, produced the effect of a 
unique personality. . . . I remember hearing it said, at 
a time near the close of the Great War, by some men 
who were native here, that Edward Everett, A.B., 
A.M., LL.D., ei-Governor of Massachusetts, ex-United 
States Seuator from Massachusetts, ex- President of Har- 
vard College, ex-Minister to England, litterateur, ora- 
tor, statesman, was, in respect of distinction of manners, 
in a class with but one other of his' fellow citizens; that 
other one appeared in the local directory as ' Warren, 
William, comedian, boards 2 Bulfiuch Place.' " 

According to Mr. Clapp, Charlotte Ciish- 
man, whom he saw in her assumptions of Meg 
Merrilies, Lady Macbeth, and Queen Katha- 
rine, is the only actress native to our soil 
to whom the adjective "great" can be fitly ap- 
plied. Miss Cushman's impersonation of Queen 
Katharine, he says, " must be accounted her 
crowning achievement, and, therefore, the 
highest histrionic work of any American ac- 
tress." He speaks of Charles Fechter as an 
exceedingly fascinating and eloquently appeal- 
ing actor, who was somewhat handicapped by 
the plainness of his features, the bluntness of 
his figure, and his foreign intonations. Mr. 
Clapp remarks that he has " generally felt, 
and often expressed, a distaste for broken En- 
glish on the stage, and I regard the easy-going 
toleration of the imperfect speech of alien 
actors as one of the signs of the rawness of our 
public." "We are told that the elder Salvini's 
Othello — by which this actor is most widely 
remembered — "was Shakspeare orientalized 
and supersensualized, at the cost of some of 
the Master's heroic conception, and of much 
of the Poet's beautiful thought." Yet we are 
compelled to agree with his broad statement 
that " Salvini was Charles Fechter carried up 
to the second power of all the Frenchman's 
virtues, with scarcely a hint of his limitations." 
The Hamlet of both actors met with a chorus 
of disapproval from American audiences. 

Perhaps the best and most thoughtful chap- 
ter in Mr. Clapp's book is the essay on the art 
of Henry Irving. The critic has studied the 
actor from various standpoints, and it is un- 
doubtedly true that his final conclusions are 
voiced by a large portion of the theatre- going 
public of this country. He believes that 
" Mr. Irving's art would be much more effectual than 
it is if ' to do ' were one-half ' as easy ' with him as 
his knowledge of ' what were good to do ' is clear; that 



if abundance, brilliancy, clearness and refinement of 
thought, artistic insight, definiteness of purpose, sin- 
cerity of feeling, and intensity of devotion were all that 
is needed in a player, he would be easily first among 
the actors of our time; that, since the highest end of 
acting is not to refresh and stimulate the mind, to re- 
fine and gratify the taste, or to charm the fancy, but 
strongly to move the spirit and profoundly to stir the 
heart, his claim to a place among the greatest masters 
of his craft is not yet made out." 

This same opinion is expressed by that studious 
English critic, Mr. William Archer, who is 
authority for the statement that Irving's audi- 
ences are " intellectually interested, but not 
emotionally excited." And it has been fre- 
quently pointed out that Mr. Irving violates 
one of the important duties of the stage — to 
bear aloft the standard of correct speech, and 
to make a constant appeal to the public ear in 
behalf of pure and refined enunciation. 

To Messrs. Howard and Gillette are con- 
ceded the best plays that America has produced. 
" Secret Service " is pointed out as the high- 
water mark of our play writing; it is, so to 
speak, the Hamlet of American dramatic liter- 
ature. The author is encouraged to believe 
that " A better day for the drama and the 
theatre is sure to dawn. The actors are readier 
than the public for a change to nobler condi- 
tions ; and the public, now learning to demand 
of and for itself the best things in many de- 
partments of life, will not always rest content 
with conditions that encourage mediocrity in 
that Theatre upon which it depends for the 
larger part of its entertainment." The remedy 
that he has in mind for these conditions is an 
endowed theatre, which he suggests, prophet- 
ically, will become a reality within a few years. 
It is a pessimistic rather than an optimistic 
view which Mr. Clapp takes of prevailing the- 
atrical conditions in this country ; yet he does 
not sum up conditions completely and con- 
cisely, giving causes and pointing out remedies. 
We might add that one cause for the failure of 
any drama of recent years to rise above the 
general level may be found, absurd as it may 
appear, in the close intercourse maintained be- 
tween different countries. To-day, as a quarter 
of a century ago, the French play is not merely 
a model, but is actually the basis of a large 
proportion of the dramatic literature of the 
time. The result is an influence exerted upon 
the writers of other countries which is gradu- 
ally destructive of aU originality. 

Among other subjects treated are " Spectacle, 
Farce, Melodrama, and Minstrelsy Fifty Years 
Ago." " The Isolation of Actors," and "Actual

and Ideal Training for the Stage." Mr. Clapp's 
judgments are in the main remarkably just 
and true ; the work is notably free from that 
extravagant laudation which marks the 'pren- 
tice hand. The author's style, though perhaps 
somewhat too conscious, does not reflect the 
influence of daily newspaper work, and betok- 
ens an untainted reverence for all that is true 
and best in dramatic art.

Recent Fiction.* 



The tendency of the English novel to take the 
form of biography has always been marked, al- 
though the imaginative nature of the writing is 
usually apparent, except in the case of such an 
extraordinary realist as Defoe. But Mr. Mont- 
gomery Carmicbael has just produced a work of 
fiction which it would be difBcult, from internal 
evidence alone, to exclude from the category of 
actual biography. It is entitled "The Life of John 
William Walshe, F.S.A.," and reads, from intro- 
duction to closing chapter, as if it were in very 
fact the veritable record of a man's career. What 
could be more convincing than such a prefatory 
statement as the following: "The will of my 
friend Philip Walshe has put me in possession of 
a large and extraordinary collection of valuable 
MSS., and has at the same time laid on me a task 
of no litile delicacy and difficulty. These MSS.

are the voluminous works of his father, the late 
Mr. John William Walshe, F.S.A., who died on 
the 2nd July, 1900, aged sixty-three, at Assisi, in 
Umbria, where he had passed the latter half of his 
life. Mr. Walshe was well known to scholars as 
perhaps the greatest living authority on matters 
Franciscan ; otherwise he had practically no fame." 
This statement is followed by a minute description 
of the manuscripts in question, with historical and 
bibliographical notes, and an account of how the 
editor has dealt with them in preparing the present 
" Life," together with his plans for further publi- 
cation. It takes some time to realize that this is 
all an elaborate piece of mystification, and to recall 
the fact that the name of Walshe does not figure 
in any actual list of Franciscan scholars, living or 
dead. The present imaginary biography is offered 
to us as the work of the son, Philip Walshe, who 
survived his father long enough to prepare it, but 
not long enough to arrange for the publication of 
the memoir or of the works themselves. Having 
said this much by way of explanation, we may now 
speak briefly of the memoir itself. It is, in sub- 
stance, the story of a saint, whose instincts from 
boyhood impelled him to the spiritual life, who 
groped his way out of the sordid middle-class com- 
mercialism of his early English environment into 
what proved to him the clear light and perfect 
happiness of the Catholic Church. He made his 
way to Italy while a young man, entered the house- 
hold of a Catholic English nobleman residing at 
Lucca, there received the faith, married the 
daughter of the house, and succeeded to its tradi- 
tions. Attracted in middle life to the history of 
St. Francis, he removed to Assisi, became a tertiary 
of the Franciscan order, and died in the fulness of 
time, " of the love of God," as the memoir simply 
afiirms. In all this there is little to attract the 
ordinary reader of novels, who may as well be 
warned at once that here is no book for him. But 
to the more serious reader the book has many 
things to offer. In the first place, it offers a psy- 
chological study of marvellous delicacy, such a 
study as may be found elsewhere only in the " Lives 
of the Saints " or in the history of the mystics. 
This alone should distinguish the work ; but we 
may say in addition that it is written in a style at 
once simple, strong, and beautiful, that it makes 
throughout the scholar's appeal to the scholar, and 
I that, with no more than an occasional hint of the 
controversial spirit, it portrays the great historic 
church, not the chuich of an ignorant peasantry 
led by a hardly less ignorant priesthood, but the 
church which Newman found irresistible in its 
claims, and to which Joseph De Maistre gave the 
rapturous allegiance of bis powerful intelligence. 

Our experience with the novels of " Benjamin 
Swift " has been such that, with all his skill and 
penetration, we think of him as a writer who is 
unnecessarily and perversely disagreeable. It is 
therefore something of a surprise to find that " The 
Game of Love " is not founded upon the sort of

nnpleasant conception in which he has hitherto 
delighted, but is simply a well-arranged story of 
normal baman character, as far as the chief actors 
are concerned. There is a professional pickpocket, 
to be Bare, whom we encounter in the opening pages, 
not without some apprehension that he may figure 
as the hero ; there is also a physician who becomes 
a criminal for the sake of science and love com- 
bined, and there is a miser of the conventional sort. 
Bat these are minor characters, although their fate 
is closely interwoven with the plot. The main in- 
terest is of a healthy human sort, and is surprisingly 
well sustained. The final disentanglement of all 
the complications requires a rather breathless hur- 
rying from point to point, and might profitably 
have been elaborat«d. The novelist is as brilliant 
as ever in his use of epigram or incisive comment, 
and his humor, which rarely fails him when needed, 
is thoroughly enjoyable. 

" Spindle and Plough," by Mrs. Henry Dudeney, 
is a novel upon which it is possible to bestow almost 
unqualified praise. The earlier books of this pow- 
erful writer have been marred by her insistence 
npon a realism bo brutal and squalid as to produce 
a marked sense of repulsion, tending to ob§care the 
really fine qualities of her work. In •' Spindle and 
Plough " there is still realism and to spare, but 
either the nature of the theme or the writer's im- 
provement in taste has spared us the repulsive sort 
of detail in which •• The Maternity of Harriott 
Wicken " abounded, and leaves the reader free to ex- 
press his unrestrained admiration. Mrs. Dudeney 's 
heroine this time is Shaiisha Pilgrim, a woman of 
primitive and passionate nature, absolutely un- 
worldly, and instinctively abhorrent of every mani- 
festation of vulgarity or vice. This fine, frank, 
op»en-air creature takes a deep delight — a whole- 
some and not a sentimental delight — in contact with 
nature, and has found in her professional training 
as a landscape gardener the very resource that she 
most needs. Contrasted with her we have three 
other persons, — her widowed mother, a vain and 
silly person to whom anything but petty and child- 
ish views of life are impossible; her employer, 
whom nature might have made a gentleman had 
he not become hopelessly sophisticated by the 
influences of an artificial society; and the mean- 
natured, doll-faced creature whom he marries after 
Shaiisha has contemptuously rejected his overtures. 
Then there is another person, a rustic named Felix 
Rale, who seems to be a good deal of a man until 
unexpected good lack develops a streak of vulgarity 
in his nature, making Shaiisha wonder how she 
could ever have been attracted to him. Later in 
the story, when the mother has eloped with a pursy 
and altogether obnoxious tradesman, when the gen- 
tleman and the shallow little schemer have plunged 
into the misery of marriage, and when Shaiisha 
herself, growing old, begins to realise that some- 
thing is lacking in her life, Felix Rule reappears, 
humiliated by the loss of his money, and finds 
to his surprise that in this dejected guise he makes 



a real appeal to the sympathies of the woman 
whom he had formerly sought to win by the offer 
of a social position and a life of idleness. Amid 
all these changing scenes and searching tests, the 
character of the heroine rings true, and grows 
nobler and finer with every year. Her scorn for the 
petty vanities of those aboat her is tempered by a 
large and sympathetic tolerance for their weakness, 
and she ever renews her own strength at the 
primal sources. Finally, she becomes the possessor 
of the -estate and the garden that she so passionately 
loves, and the human emotions, so long repressed, 
find satisfaction in the companionship of the chas- 
tened Felix Rale. We have said nothing of the 
quiet but pervasive humor of this book, nothing of 
its skilful management of plot and incident, nothing 
of its unaffected and striking style. It is just such 
a book as we have hoped that Mrs. Dudeney would 
some day write, just such a book as we knew she 
had it within her power to write. The similarity of 
this work to the most characteristic work of Mr. 
Hardy is likely to be insisted upon overmuch, but 
is still fairly obvious, and should not be left an- 
mentioned. 

'■ The Way of Elseape " is a novel that opens 
brightly in the south of France. A young medical 
student from Edinburgh, engaged to a worthy young 
woman of that city, has sought the shores of the 
Mediterranean for rest and relaxation. He meets a 
vivacious French-English maiden, promptly falls in 
love with her, and the consequences, as we do not 
even surmise at the time but learn only long after- 
wards, are of the most serious character. Called 
home by duty, as it seems, he wrestles with his mem- 
ories for a time, then marries, tries to forget the girl 
whom he has wronged, and degenerates into a suc- 
cessful and fashionable practitioner. He has his re- 
ward, for his wife develops a taste for distributing 
tracts and leading prayer-meetings. Meanwhile the 
heroine, after a brave straggle with her sufferings, 
shapes for herself a serviceable career, first as a 
governess, then as the guardian and protector of four 
children, her half-sisters, thrown upon the world by 
the death of their mother. It is with the development 
of the heroine's character, under this pressure, that 
the story is chiefly concerned. It would be a good 
story were it not dominated by a hectic religiosity. 
The old worn theme of the pride of the intellect and 
its fall, of the need of something upon which to lean 
in time of trouble, is brought into action with the 
usual morbid emphasis, until we discover that we 
have been reading a sort of Sunday-school story all 
the time, and not a serious work of fiction.

It is a tale of the First Empire, and has to do with 
the Angevin Chouannerie. The period is that of 
the Emperor's prime, when he was the undispated 
master of France, and when conspiracy was eagerly 
sought out by the agents of the ruler and relent- 
lessly punished. The various types of the period 
are portrayed, — the irreconcilable royalist, the

time-serving adherent of the new rSffime, the police 
spy, and the soldier of the Empire. The latter is a 
vulgar and brutal person of low birth, who seeks to 
force a marriage with a daughter of the aristocracy. 
Angelot, being the favored suitor, as far as the her- 
oine is concerned, becomes a thorn in the general's 
flesh, and is made the victim of much persecution. 
True love triumphs in the end, to the discomfiture 
of the general, and all ends happily. The story is 
not particularly stirring, but it is pleasantly told, 
and reveals a close acquaintance with the scenes 
and the society which it seeks to depict. 

A story of very different type, and much more 
nearly related to literature, is the " Sons of the 
Sword," by Mrs. Margaret L. Woods. This also 
is a Napoleonic romance, with a scene laid in Spain 
during the struggle for the conquest of the Penin- 
sula, and the Emperor himself plays a conspicuous 
part. He is portrayed with an art which does not 
spare the despicable aspects of his nature, yet 
which does not grudge him the possession of some 
of the nobler traits of character. The heroine is 
an Irish refugee, with whom one of Napoleon's 
favorite officers seeks at first to have sport, and 
ends by becoming the serious lover. Presented to 
us at the outset in a disagreeable light, we undergo, 
together with the heroine, a gradual change of feel- 
ing toward him, until at last he appears as an ac- 
ceptable hero through the display of courage and 
self-sacrificing devotion. There really seems to be 
no need that he should die in the last chapter, and 
it is not easy to forgive the author for thus dispos- 
ing of him. The book contains many vivid scenes 
of battles, and forced marches, and quarrels between 
the French soldiers and the infuriated Spanish 
peasantry. Some of these scenes are extraordina- 
rily well done, and the whole romance is one of 
deep and sustained interest. 

Mr. Marriot Watson has the happy faculty of 
combining invention with style. The style may be 
described as simplified Meredithian, and one must 
acquire the taste for it ; but style of any kind is so 
rare in the romance of adventure that we must not 
be too critical. " The House Divided " may cer- 
tainly boast of a distinguished manner, and is, be- 
sides, a story of quite thrilling interest. lb is placed 
in the eighteenth century, a period which the author 
knows well, and the scene is the southern coast of 
England. The hero comes from Vermont, upon 
advices from his lawyer, to lay claim to an estate 
which is held by the Earl of Deverill, a nobleman 
of the swearing and sporting type, who fears 
neither God nor the devil, and who is outspoken to 
the point of the coarsest brutality. He lays various 
plots for the ruin of the claimant ; and, these fail- 
ing him, provokes a personal encounter in which 
he slays his opponent, only to learn that the man 
whom he has slain is in reality his own son. instead 
of being the son of his hated old-time rival. The 
love scenes in this remarkable romance have a ten- 
der beauty which more than suggests the magic 
of the great novelist who has obviously been the 



author's exemplar. Mr. Marriott Watson is ex- 
ceptionally happy in his portraiture of women, and 
nothing could easily be finer than the contrasted 
types of the virginal heroine and the passionate 
woman of the world whose jealousy brings about 
the tragic ending. 

Of style, the romances of Mr. Marchmont are 
guiltless ; and it is upon invention alone that he 
depends for his effects. They are usually well- 
contrived from the theatrical point of view, and 
the latest novel of this ingenious writer is quite 
as good as its several predecessors. The historical 
background of " Sarita, the Carlist," is not of the 
imaginary " Zenda " sort, but is furnished forth by 
recent happenings in Spain. The time is the very 
eve of the late war, and the assassination of C^novas 
is reproduced in the assassination of the Minister 
Qaesada, who is the evil genius of the story. The 
Queen Regent and the young King also figure, and 
the central episode is the thwarting of a Carlist plot 
for the abduction of the latter. This makes the 
third novel of Carlist intrigue that we have read 
within the past few naonths. 

In the advertising pages of " My Lady Para- 
mount " we are confronted with some words of our 
own concerning one of Mr. Harland's earlier books, 
to the effect that the author " has not gone to the 
school of the best Frenchmen in vain, and has at 
last shown himself capable of workmanship so deli- 
cate that we have not the heart to say aught but 
praise concerning it." Consistency is too fair a jewel 
to be purposely flawed, and we are thus under 
bonds, as it were, to say nice things about Mr. Har- 
land's latest book. The task is, fortunately, not a 
strain upon the conscience, for " My Lady Para- 
mount " deserves to have nice things said about it. 
As a comedy of sentiment and as a breathless love- 
story, it is charmingly exciting from beginning to 
end. It coruscates with cleverness, and its plot, 
albeit fantastic, lends itself admirably to the writer's 
stylistic purposes. There is a jester of whom we 
grow slightly weary, but both hero and heroine are 
all that the heart could wish. The former is an 
English gentleman with certain hereditary rights 
in a petty Italian island state. The heroine is in 
actual possession, for the legitimate heir has been 
dispossessed as a consequence of the political revo- 
lution by which United Italy was wrought. But 
the heroine has both a conscience and a romantic 
imagination, which together lead her to the es- 
capade of an incognito trip to England, where she 
meets her cousin, and deliberately plots to make 
him fall in love with her. He proves the most 
willing of victims, and all conflicting claims are in 
the end thus reconciled. Our sympathies, as far as 
history is concerned, have to be enlisted upon the 
wrong or reactionary side, which in this, as in so 
many other romantic instances, is given a sort of 
artistic rehabilitation. It is like the Stuart case 
in English history : the wrong side is the pictur- 
esque one, and gets much the best of it at the hands 
of the story-tellers.

"Mile. Foacfaette" is so good a novel in some 
respects that it is a pity it coald not be a better one 
in others. It is the story of a rag-picker's found- 
ling who becomes, successively, an inmate of the 
Bon Pasteur, a Parisian moucharde. an artist's 
model, and a congpienoas figure in the free-and-easy 
life of the Quarter. It is not quite Murger's Bobeme 
over again, which would be quite impossible at this 
later date, but it offers an approach to that portrayal 
of an irresponsible and insouciant society. The later 
chapters deal with the recent time when the Parisian 
air was charged with Dreyfasard electricity, and 
when revolutions were every day incipient. Fou- 
chette is a bright and winsome young woman, with 
finer qualities of mind and heart than her circum- 
stances would lead one to expect. We come near 
to shedding a tear when, at the end, the man whom 
she loves, and whose guardian angel she has been, 
remains all unsuspecting of her devotion, makes a 
happy marriage with a colorless young woman in 
whom we cannot take the least interest, and leaves 
Fonchette no refuge bat the convent. Mr. Charles 
Theodore Murray is the writer of this entertMning 
and well-informed novel. He leaves numerous 
things unexplained or insufficiently accounted for, 
but the main thread of his narrative is kept pretty 
steadily in hand. 

Mr. Cable's •• Bylow Hill " has the dimensions of 
a novelette, and. within its limits, accomplishes the 
portrayal of a group of half a doren people in iheir 
mutual relations. The scene is a New England 
town, and the i^sae is made tragic by a mistaken 
marriage and an insanely jealous husband. Some- 
how we feel that Mr. Cable has never become quite 
acclimated to his Northern home, and, with all the 
delicacy of his literary art, we miss in this story the 
vital glow and the variety of his earlier work. He 
has never had the gift of lucid exposition, and. even 
when working on so reduced a scale as the present 
one, he contrives to puzzle us not a little in our effort 
to differentiate his characters and understand their 
motives. The story may be read with satisfaction 
in its grace of manner and subtlety of analysis, bat 
will add nothing to the author's reputation. 

*• The Courage of Conviction," by Mr. T. R. Sul- 
livan, is a novel of New York life. It is based upon 
familiar themes. — the woman who marries without 
love, and the man who is tempted by material re- 
wards to forsake the higher calling which nature 
has planned for him. Both come to grief, as is 
just, and afterwards contrive to patch up, after a 
fashion, the lives that their mistaken choice has 
marred. There is far too much of moralizing in 
this work, and not nearly enough of narrative. It 
is very well devised, and carefully written, but can- 
not be credited with either distinction or absorbing 
interest. 

The republication of two earlier novels, and the 
appearance of a new one. " The Rescue," calls 
marked attention to the work of Miss Anne Douglas 
Sedgwick, who appears to be a writer of exceptional 
merit. " The Rescue " is a novel which, first of all. 



has distinction of style, a quality in which it sug- 
gests the fine and subtle art of Mrs. Wharton. It is 
the simple story of the tragedy of a woman's soul. 
Her life seemingly wrecked by an unhappy mar- 
riage, the heroine is early left a widow with a single 
child. The degradation of her term of forced com- 
panionship with the selfish and vulgar man whom 
she has called husband has so wounded her pride 
that, when his death frees her, the very springs of 
happiness seem to have been dried up forever, and 
she faces a dreary future which offers no promise of 
cheer. Her mistake appears irreparable, and she ac- 
cepts the penalty with dignity and strength of spirit. 
Some score of years later, a man much younger 
than herself chances apon an old photograph, 
learns something of her history, and deliberately 
seeks her out in the belief that his own happiness is 
destined to be bound up with hers. The situation 
thus created is clearly unnatural, and it would take 
more than Miss Sedgwick's art to make us enter 
into it with complete sympathy. That we be- 
come as interested as we do is no small tribute to 
her achievement. The tragedy of the situation is 
not wholly retrospective, tor the daughter of this 
woman is a constant reminder of the past. This 
daughter has inherited her father's character rather 
than her mother's, and as one mean or vicious trait 
after another becomes revealed, the mother has a 
bittor straggle between doty toward her child and 
repulsion for the hereditary endowment which no 
amount of careful training seems able to modify. 
In the end, the daughter sinks to her natural level, 
and the mother accepts the eagerly proffered love 
of the mtui who has restored a sort of happiness, 
albeit maeh chastened, to her existence. The whole 
story is told with admirable incisiveness and colored 
by the exhibition of deep but duly restrained emo- 
tion. Its psychological truthfulness is as apparent 
as its sincerity, and it is an example of saeeess at- 
tained by strictly legitimate means. 

Mrs. Elisabeth PuUen (formerly Cavaua) will 
be pleasantly remembered as the author of certain 
charming stories of Southern Italy, in which the 
shrewd humor of a keen American observer was 
made to react upon an intimate knowledge of 
Italian life and character. But these stories hardly 
prepared us for the delightfully whimsical narra- 
tive of adventure called " Mr. Whitman," with 
which Mrs. Fallen has now broken a long silence. 
It is a story of brigands, as the title-page avers, 
but of brigands that belong to the category of 
Mr. Stockton's pirates, and that seem to have 
stepped directly from the opera bouffe stage. This 
suggestion of the story-teller whom we have so 
recently lost is inevitable, not only because his 
name is constantly brought to mind by Mrs. Pul- 
len's arrangement of incidents, but also because of 
the striking similarity of design in the eases of the 
leading figures of Mr. Stockton's last book and the 
one now under consideration. For Mr. Whitman, 
like Captain Bonnet, is a man of dual soul. To 
the outward observer, both are staid, prosaic, and

altogether respectable members of society, engaged 
in commercial life, and seemingly quite guiltless of 
a romantic inspiration. But Captain Bonnet, as 
we know, was a pirate at heart, and became one 
in fact when the opportunity offered ; and so Mr. 
Whitman, when he realized his long-cherished 
dream of visiting Italy, and having taken the jour- 
ney, fell into the hands of the brigands, found 
himself quite at home, and rising to the situation, 
became a brigand chieftain himself. How he cap- 
tivated his captors, how they acclaimed him as 
their leader, how he drew up a constitution for the 
band on strictly business principles, and how he 
superintended their operations in the interest of 
good management and fair dealing, — how he did 
all these things, and others, makes a long story, 
which is inimitably told by Mrs. Pullen. Of course 
the story could not end with things in this shape, 
and so we are told finally how Mr. Whitman ob- 
tains amnesty for his fellow-robbers, and for him- 
self a charming Italian wife. In all this there is 
the best of entertainment and innocent excitement, 
for which the author deserves and shall have our 
heartiest thanks. 

The young man of wealth who devotes himself, 
in spite of family opposition, to the amelioration 
of industrial conditions has become a somewhat 
familiar figure of late in our popular fiction. The 
usual upshot is that his well-intentioned efforts 
meet with ingratitude, that he unchains forces that 
he cannot control, and that he abandons the ex- 
periment a sadder and wiser man than when he 
entered upon it. The hero of "Philip Longstreth" 
is such a reformer, but his career does not follow 
the usual course. His efforts are actually appre- 
ciated by their beneficiaries, and he really does suc- 
ceed in creating a relation of mutual helpfulness 
and service between himself and the employes of 
his factory. So much for the sociological side of 
the story. On the sentimental side, he is in love 
with two women, one of his own class, the other 
an operative. We are left in doubt until the very 
end as to which of the two is to become his wife. 
When convention triumphs over sentiment we are 
rather disappointed, because the factory girl is the 
more attractive of the two women. Miss Marie 
Van Vorst is the author of this novel, which has 
so many faults that we lack the space in which to 
particularize. 

" The Washingtonians," by Miss Pauline Brad- 
ford Mackie (Mrs. Herbert Hopkins), is a novel of 
the Capital during the last year of the Civil War. 
To a certain extent, it is a novel h, clef, for besides 
the figure of the President we have unmistakable 
portraits of Secretary Chase and his brilliant 
daughter, and very likely others not so readily 
recognizable. The misguided effort of the Secre- 
tary to become Lincoln's successor, abetted by his 
ambitious daughter, affords the substance of the 
plot, which is well-managed, and betrays besides 
a considerable knowledge of social and political 



Washington in the sixties. The story ends with 
the news frodi Ohio declaring that the convention 
has given a majority for the President. Mrs. Hop- 
kins is always a pleasing writer, and her presenta- 
tion of the heroine is an excellent piece of firm and 
distinct characterization.

NOTES ON NOVELS. 



The Pennyroyal District in Kentucky ventures to look 
down upon the Blue Grass Region of that favored 
commonwealth, having been settled by officers of the 
Coutinental army ou grants from the parent State of 
Virginia. Here Mrs. Nancy Huston Banks places the 
scene of her serene and delightful story of " Oldfield " 
(Macmillan), certain from its uame, characters, and 
treatment to remind the reader of " Crauford." Little 
Miss Judy Bramwell will serve as a type of new-world 
gentlewoman, drawn as her portrait is with a loving 
care and a tenderness that make it very real. Being a 
Kentucky story it is ilievitable that there should be 
something in the nature of a blood feud in its pages. 
With great good sense, Mrs. Banks has turned this rem- 
nant of savagery the other way around, and the dra- 
matic climax of the book comes with the refusal of a 
wise judge upon the bench to undertake the miserable 
business of personal vengeance. Everywhere the story 
shows signs of deliberation, of writing for love of the 
art of writing, and of a large and kindly interest in 
humanity. 

Short stories bound up into a volume are becoming 
rare in these days, hardly one such book appearing to a 
score containing extended novels. Even so good a col- 
lection as Mr. Richard Harding Davis has made hears 
the title of the 6rst of the five tales which comprise its 
content without qualifying phrase, and it comes into the 
world as " Ranson's Folly " (Seribner). The stories are 
various — one of the army, one of a dog, one of the 
newspaper world, one of love abroad, an'd one in quite 
the manner of Stevenson's " New Arabian Nights." All 
are workmanlike, all are interesting, and they have the 
unquestionable advantage of being written purely to 
afford amusement, and not in the least for edification. 
Gathered as they are from the pages of the magazines 
in which they have appeared, they are doubtless already 
familiar to many readers; but they lose nothing by be- 
ing placed in apposition here. 

VVales is a country so far from the beaten track of 
travel, so remote from the bustle of modern life as 
practiced in the great world, that Mr. Allen Raine, who 
writes " A Welsh Witch" (Appleton) as his sixth or 
seventh story of the Principality, poses before the reader 
as a discoverer. His heroine, as the name indicates, is 
of no common type, — a child of the people, with gypsy 
blood to send her heart beating with that of nature, one 
who is regarded by her conventional neighbors with 
superstitious awe. Apart from this figure, and that of 
her distressfully drunken father, the story is idyllic in 
its cast, working out a pretty though interrupted ro- 
mance with much skill. Those who have followed Mr. 
Raine's work from the beginning will find little diffi- 
culty in understanding the numerous Cymric words and 
phrases with which it is sprinkled ; others may be

tronbled br this too obTions device to add the impres- 
sion of locality. 

Writing out of an extended experience and clearly 
within its boands, Mi^s Clara Morris has drawn snch 
a picture of the American stage in <* A Pasteboard 
Crown " (Scribner) as must shock more than one of her 
admirers. Her heroine is a girl of family and breeding, 
her hero an actor- manager in the best repute; yet the 
girl goes altogether wrong with her patron, and the 
man is shown to be conscienceless in art and morals 
both. The story is unquestionably disagreeable, from 
the moment of the girl's downfall until the tragic close, 
though redeemed in part by her sister's happy marriage 
and motherhood. The fourth of Miss Morris's pub- 
lished works, ic shows well-defined dissimilarities in 
manner from its predecessors, many more than its being 
a first continuous novel demand. Heretofore the reader 
has been able to trace resemblances between the author's 
histrionic art and her literary art, finding in both a 
characteristic crudity and power. In this work there 
is a finish largely lacking before, with a sense of propor- 
tion and a broader knowledge that give it distinction. 
Mr. Harry Leon Wilson, the author of " The Spend- 
ers, a Tale of the Third Generation " (Lothrop), was 
bom in Illinois, and has divided his adult life between 
Ifebraska and Xew York. His very readable romance 
shows a wide knowledge of both eastern and western 
America, the scenes alternating between the mountains 
and the Atlantic coast. The theme is an attractive one, 
most of the book being given up to an account of the 
manner in which the widow of a Western capitalist passes 
a season in New York with her son and daughter, the 
three making money fly and extracting all the merri- 
ment possible out of a frivolous and dissipated life; and 
though the mother is given to charitable deeds for a 
share of her expenditure, a certain lack of sensibility, 
noticeable throughout the narrative, places her on the 
same level as her children. The grandfather of these 
persons is the most striking figure in the book and the 
dem ex machina who eventually rescues the boy and 
puts him in the way of redemption, but only through 
hard work in the money-getting world. The pictures, 
by Mrs. O'Neill Latham, are admirably illustrative of 
the spirit of the book, — a sympathy explicable, per- 
haps, by her recent marriage to the author. 

Mr. Barry Pain is a maker of excellent fun, and his 
ingenious tale of " The One Before " (Scribner) the best 
of light reading. A magic ring, eagerly sought for by 
an Oriental owner throughout the story, has the power 
to confer upon its wearer the character of the person 
who had worn it just before. The ring makes several 
instructive shifts under Mr. Pain's skilful direction, but 
the most important one places it, fresh from the hand 
of a professional lion-tamer, on the finger of a wife 
subjected to the exactions of a petty domestic tyrant. 
The change in the relative positions of the couple after 
the magic becomes efficacious is as pleasant as it is in- 
structive. To this character drawing is added the zest 
of a search for the missing jewel, conducted by a rather 
discordant family of London Jews. In these, as in the 
Gentiles of the book, Mr. Pain has a genius for search- 
ing out and exploiting weaknesses and foibles, leaving 
the story laughworthy throughout, even in the course 
of true love which trickles through it. 

One whirl of the revolutionary wheel in some South 
American Republic gives Miss Margery Williams the 
material for her novelette of " The Late Returning " 
(Macmillan), a tropical passion of the revolutionary 



leader for the favorite of the chief executive against 
whom he conspires lending the other element of ro- 
mance. The narrative is in good part from the mouths 
of newspaper men from these L'nited States, young 
fellows who are conducting a daily journal in the capi- 
tal of the unnamed country under difficulties largely 
exotic. The book is brief, but filled with matter, and 
shows a skill in handling that promises still better work 
in the future. It wiU certainly interest its readers, even 
in hot weather. 

Mr. Frederick Trevor Hill's story of " The Minority " 
(Stokes) is one of commercial chicanery for the most 
part, dealing with great industrial combinations, labor 
difficulties, speculations on the Stock Exchange, and 
other similar components of our present civilization. 
The principal character is a young man who has inher- 
ited a large manufacturing business, and feels a senti- 
mental and somewhat patronizing obligation toward his 
working people. This sentiment dissipates itself rapidly 
when they show their readiness to strike, though it is 
really the commercial rivals of the concern who insti- 
gate the workmen's demands. The villain of the book 
is the father of the heroine, and his pntting her in the 
young manufacturer's way to aid him in getting the 
better of the young man financially leads to the event- 
ual happiness of both. The treatment tends more to 
realism than to optimism, but it is no bad picture of the 
times. 

It would be doing a serious injustice to everyone con- 
cerned to call the titular character of Mr. Will N. Har- 
ben's " Abner Daniel" (Harper) a southern "David 
Hamm." The story does not ramble, but presents a 
clear picture of life in Georgia, setting forth the manner 
in which a speculator in timber-land is allowed to realize 
a comfortable fortune by various devices admitted in 
the world of commerce, but for the most part far more 
expedient than commendable. In the several transac- 
tions the bachelor uncle, Abner, plays the part of a 
chorus, while others take the more active parts until 
the climax. In this Abner has a full share, however 
much he is overshadowed elsewhere. We like to think 
of the South as a part of America not yet commercial- 
ized, and Mr. Harben is by no means convincing, though 
always interesting and doubtless correct, in showing the 
part such speculations play in its development, both 
material and intellectual. 

" Hearts Courageous " (Bowen-Merrill) is a great 
improvement in every respect upon the former books of 
Miss Hallie Erminie Rives, being a well worked out 
romance of the .\merican Revolution. The leading 
part is played by a French nobleman, an emissary of 
Louis XVI. sent to America to report to his royal mas- 
ter on the condition of the colonies in respect of their 
revolt against British rule. By a device neither original 
nor shop- worn, he is made to appear as an impostor 
masquerading in his own personality, and held by the 
British to be in their employ. The resulting situations 
are filled with excitement, complicated by the love the 
Frenchman has awakened in a patriotic Virginia girl of 
fine family. Many of the leading characters of the 
period come into the argument at one time or another. 
The chief fault of the book is the obviousness of the 
Frenchman's disguise; though this will but little trouble 
an inexperienced reader. 

Another romance of the Revolntion is Mr. James 
Eugene Farmer's " Brinton Eliot: From Yale to York- 
town " (Macmillan). The book opens with a fairly well 
realized description of Yale College just before New

England revolted openly, with Nathan Hale, and many 
another contributor to our national independence of 
lesser note, as undergraduates in that time-honored in- 
stitution of learning. The poet Freneau appears also, 
and is made to compose some of his stinging satires on 
British misrule for Mr. Farmer's pages. Throughout 
the work appears as a praiseworthy attempt to show 
the obligations of the fathers of the Republic to the 
men of Yale; but the manner is rather that of an ama- 
teur than of an accomplished writer of fiction. Yet the 
faults are chiefly those of a first novel, and Mr. Farmer 
has all the world before him when he chooses a topic 
not so limited in its scope. 

With the frauk intention to preach peace as one of 
the essentials of Christianity, " Edna Lyall " (Miss Ada 
Ellen Bayly) has taken for her latest novel the title 
of "The Hinderers" (Longmans), from the woe pro- 
nounced by Jesus upon the lawyers, — " Them that 
were entering in ye hindered," — and both her hero 
and heroine stand against the mania for conquest and 
aggrandizement which has dominated Great Britain 
since the beginning of hostilities in South Africa. 
With so insistent a theme, it is inevitable that the lit- 
erary art of the book must suffer; yet it is a word 
spoken in season, even though the war itself has ceased. 
For the rest, the story is one of English fashionable 
life, with the frivolity and self-seeking of the upper 
middle classes in abrupt contrast with the lives of a 
few highly principled men and women. 

A new edition of Mr. Clive Holland's " My Japanese 
Wife " (Stokes) attests the popularity of that pleasing 
account of the failure of a delightful little girl of Nip- 
pon to adapt herself to British ways when taken by her 
fond husband to his home. Mr. Holland has rewritten 
a few passages in the book without changing its pur- 
port or interest, and new pictures have been made 
for it. These, while endeavoring to realize Japanese 
methods, go only half way, and the result is not alto- 
gether satisfactory. 

The misunderstandings of a married pair afford the 
nucleus around which Mr. W. E. Norris has framed 
"The Credit of the County" (Appleton), a mildly 
realistic novel of English country life. A rather silly 
young girl is wedded by a man who makes too few 
allowances for her youth and lack of stability, and he 
is hardly to be blamed for holding that she shall be 
his wife in nothing but name after he has surprised 
her in the act of permitting a vapid youth of the neigh- 
borhood to kiss her. The head of a pushing and newly- 
rich family also witnesses the indiscretion, and shrewdly 
uses it as a lever to pry his way into the mildly aristo- 
cratic society thereabouts. The book is slight, though 
workmanlike, and will make acceptable summer reading. 

Sara Jeannette Duncan (Mrs. Everard Cotes) may 
certainly be regarded as one likely to hold the scales 
even, in such a consideration of British and American 
social life as she depicts in " Those Delightful Amer- 
icans " (Appleton). Born in Canada and accustomed 
to Americans from infancy, long a resident in India 
and well known in English society as well, she is ad- 
mirably fitted to analyze the differences between lives 
so widely variant and yet so closely akin. She might 
perhaps be quarrelled with as having selected for her 
exemplars of American society the men and women 
and youth of a generation which had made its own 
fortunes, but if she had gone elsewhere her contrast 
between these people and her satisfied English aristo- 
crats would have been less acute and by no means so 



amusing. The episode of the elderly woman of vast 
wealth who prefers to attend to her own housekeeping 
in a palace on the Hudson River, and finds herself con- 
fronted with a genuine English butler secured for her 
by her old-country friends, is delicious. Miss Duncan's 
sympathies, too, are evidently with the Americans in 
most respects ; though the book is so artfully con- 
trived that her English readers will probably consider 
the reverse to be her intention. 

Mr. Orr Keuyon assists his readers by setting forth 
the aims of his " Amor Victor " (Stokes) in a " Note 
Explanatory " which he prints at the end of the vol- 
ume, and prefixes a "Note Pi-efatory " to ask that 
the explanatory note be read both " before and after 
taking" in the body of the story. These aims are 
high, it is hardly needful to remark, but they are imper- 
fectly realized. The sufferings of the early Christians 
in the reign of Tiberius are rather lost sight of, so near 
a demigod is the protagonist, who himself loses sight of 
his baptism by the Beloved Apostle from time to time. 
The scenes in the arena of the Coliseum at Rome are 
told with an evident love for vivid description, and the 
horrors come out in full force. But a large part of 
the concluding explanation might have been omitted to 
advantage. 

The growth of a little Maine settlement to the 
stature of a fashionable sea-side resort is set forth in 
Mrs. Henrietta G. Rowe's " A Maid of Bar Harbor " 
(Little, Brown & Co.), and the " unearned increment " 
of the single-taxers plays no small part in developing 
the characters of the original residents, a brother going 
down to moral ruin, and a sister to comfort of both soul 
and body. This compensating effect of greed is one of 
the good things in the book, but its chief point lies in 
the manner in which the evolution of the little village 
is suggested from page to page. Mrs. Rowe has a real 
heroine, and has done wisely in selecting for the mate 
of so nice a girl the playmate of her childhood. 

Though Mr. J. A. Altsheler introduces Tarleton and 
Morgan into "My Captive" (Appleton), and ends his 
narrative with the American victory at Cowpens, his 
situations are nowhere essentially those of the Revolu- 
tionary war, and the numerous captures and recaptures 
of the patriotic hero and Tory heroine, which make up 
the greater part of his story, are fairly assignable to 
any condition of partisan warfare in any country. It is 
a story of event, and not of character; yet the growth 
of love between the capturer and the captive, and the 
reversal now and again of the positions of the two, are 
not devoid of the power to hold attention. 

Mr. E. L. Vincent is an optimist in politics, and the 
principal figure in his " Margaret Bowlby " (Lothrop) 
is a young miner who is able singlehanded to triumph 
over wrong and corruption in the legislature of no less 
a state than Pennsylvania. He does not do much him- 
self, except to present an impregnable armor of right- 
eousness to his adversaries at all times; yet this leads 
him to the governorship of the great commonwealth, in 
a manner that every reader must sincerely wish might 
be prophetic. From this statement it may be judged 
that the author is not deeply versed either in practical 
politics or in the history of the particular legislature 
he has chosen as the Augean stable for his Hercules to 
cleanse. Nor does he go far in the way of convincing 
his readers by the development of character. But as 
a counsel of perfection, the story makes very pleasant 
reading in these days of political degradation and 
dismay.

THE DIAL

Two yooDg men and one jooDg woman, all Amer- 
icans of tbe better class, form a sort of joint Robinson 
Crusoe in Mr. Charles L. Marsh's " Not on the Chart" 
(Stakea). One of them is an engineer, and the other a 
■ ■i w Ma lly informed person so far as the two men are 
concerned, and it is inevitable that they should both fall 
in love with the young woman. The ensuing rivalry and 
its results are well brought out and never fail of inter- 
est. The great strain on the probabilities lies in the 
astonishing amount of knowledge of everything pos- 
sessed by the unsuccessful lover, — yet there is prece- 
dent and to spare in other and earlier tales of castaways 
upon desert islands. 

Mrs. Sheppard Stevens has drawn extensively on tbe 
history of the city of St. Louis at tbe beginning of tbe 
last century for her novel " In the £agle's Talon " 
(Little, Brown & Co.). The simple and primitive life 
of the French residents is soon exchanged, however, for 
the whirl of Paris under tbe First Consul, and the dra- 
matic climax is interwoven with the making of tbe 
treaty by which France ceded tbe territory of Louisiana- 
Mrs. Stevens has left several loose ends in her book, 
which is rather unevenly written. 

Mr. R. H. Davis records, in one of bis short stories, 
that a great British statesman found his best recreation 
in reading detective stories. Many another must con- 
fess a sly fondness for this sort of pastime, — a demand 
which cannot, after all, be very great or it is to be pre- 
sumed that more such stories would be written. Mr. 
A. W. Marcbmont, in "Miser Hoadley's Secret" (New 
Amsterdam Book Co.), tells a very good one, in which 
the chief character leads a double life, and tbe mys- 
tery depends upon strong resemblances between two 
criminals implicated. An oversight on the author's part 
leaves some valuable jewels in the hands of one of tbe 
villains, and quite unaccounted for; and the heroine is 
somewhat too manly, and the hero a trifle ladylike. 
Tet it is one of the best recent stories of its kind, and 
can be depended upon for keeping its readers awake. 

The demand for stories of animals, and nature stories 
in general, has been rather marked of late. Miss Ellen 
Velvin, F.Z.S., is well equipped for the task she un- 
dertakes in " Rataplan, a RJague Elephant, and Other 
Stories" (Altemns). A scientific knowledge of tbe 
habits of the fifteen beasts and one bird which enter 
into her scheme results in much information pleasantly 
concealed for younger readers; and there are hints at 
the broader democracy that includes all created 
things in its scope, tbe rights of pets under children's 
domination, and of the better side of tbe nature of our 
humbler kinsfolk. The numerons illustrations in color, 
by Mr. Gnstave Verbeck, add greatly to the attractive- 
ness of the volume, which will make an excellent gift 
at any time of the year for young and growing people. 

The ability to write vividly and well enables Mr. 
William Steams Davis to succeed where so many have 
failed, in writing a novel out of ancient sacred and pro- 
fane historv commingled. His last novel, " Belshazzar, 
a Tale of the Fall of Babylon " (Doubleday, Page & Co.), 
embodies a considerable amount of learning, much of 
the latest knowledge of the Assyriologists finding place 
in his narrative, though in its main facts it follows 
rather the book of Daniel. Some of this knowledge is not 
fully realized, and there is a general lack of psychical 
distinction between the oriental characters utilized, 
making it a story of event rather than of development. 
Still, it is a stirring romance, Daniel and the Prophet 
of the Captivity, tbe second Isaiah, playing a great part 



in the development of tbe plot. One fault is the insist- 
ent use of quotation marks to indicate certain techni- 
calities of Assyriological study, a practice seriously 
interfering with the book's verisimilitude. Nor is the 
enormous antiquity of Mesopotamian civilization suffi- 
ciently insisted upon. 

The themes of the ten transcripts from metropolitan 
life that make up Miss Elizabeth G. Jordan's " Tales of 
Destiny " (Harper) are invariably on the tragical side 
of life, redeemed in most instances by a feeling of sym- 
pathetic humanity which may be taken for humor in its 
better sense. Those who recall Miss Jordan's ** Tales 
of the City Room " will find several stories from tbe 
same source here, while the milder and more serene 
" Tales of the Cloister " furnish no further inspira- 
tion, — an omission to be regretted. It is to be added, 
by way of compensation, that few books in general lit- 
erature have appeared lately which contain so much 
BiOTality, pure and undefiled, leading in occasional epi- 
sodes to the absorption of the literary by the ethical 
interest. Miss Jordan is a keen observer and analyst, 
and it is to be hoped she will soon essay some fictional 
work of greater magnitude. 

"Strangers at the Gate: Tales of Russian Jewry " 
(Jewish Publication Society of America) contains no 
fewer than eighteen episodes from a racial life left 
uninterpreted in American literature except for Mr. 
Samuel Gordon, the author of these and two or three 
similar collections. So far do his scenes and characters 
transcend ordinary Gentile experience that it is difficult 
to appreciate the real worth of bis writing. So far 
from the oriental exaggeration which might well attach 
to these tales, there is everywhere a fine reserve and an 
indieation of reserved strength which promise even 
better things than these vignettes from Jewish life in 
Russia — or Russian life in Jewry. There is material 
enough and to spare for such an author as Mr. Gordon 
in the Ghettos of the great American cities, and it is 
greatly to be desired that his attention should turn to 
this fertile field. 

Mrs. Lucy Meacham Tbmston's " A Girl of Virginia" 
(Little, Brown & Co.) is a well-conceived story of tbe 
University of Virginia, successfully embodying the 
academic life of one of the worthiest and most notable 
of American educational institutions. The contrast be- 
tween the feeling of the modern commercial world and 
certain fine old Virginian traditions is admirably worked 
out. It is a great pity the text of this book could not 
have been more carefully revised, as to details of style 
and grammar. 

It is hard to do jostiee to tbe book called " Mistress 
Dorothy of Haddon Hall " (Fenno), by a writer hitherto 
unknown, Mr. Henry Hastings. The title and seleetion 
of characters both trespass upon Mr. Charles Major's 
successful romance to an extent which makes confusion 
of the two almost inevitable. As the present story 
forces comparisons with its predecessor, it may be said 
at once that, quite apart from its lack of originality, it 
is in every way inferior. Mr. Hastings has all the 
faults of a novice, his historical holdings in the period 
he discusses are almost invisible, and his work is crude 
and unsatisfactory. 

In her " Lafitte of Louisiana " (Little, Brown & Co.),. 
Miss Mary Devereux has been as successful in the 
choice of a hero as was Mrs. Catherwood with Eleazar 
Williams in " Lazarre." Indeed, there are many curi- 
ous parallels to be drawn between the " Pirate of tbe 
Gulf " and the pretender to tbe throne of France, so far

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



as their biographies and traditions which have grown 
up around them are concerned. One tradition in the 
present volume connects Jean Lafitte with the return 
of Napoleon from Elba; and of this Miss Deverenx has 
wisely made the most. His exploits as a pirate and 
privateer are little detailed, as they are little known; 
but there is real disappointment in the author's failure 
to discuss at length Lafitte's splendid service at the 
battle of New Orleans, and to describe that notable 
victory, altogether too little known to the present gen- 
eration. The book is long, and was evidently written 
in haste; but it is nowhere lacking in interest. 

The eternal contrast between urban sophistication 
and rural simplicity, the former embodied in masculine 
and the latter in feminine form, lies at the bottom of 
Mr. William Henry Carson's " The Fool " (Dilling- 
ham). A grotesque character, whose uncomplimentary 
local soubriquet gives title to the book, is introduced 
by way of chorus to the characters, and as the general 
instrument of fate in bringing about the happiness of 
those concerned. The story is frequently amusing, 
though lacking in art as distinguished from artificiality. 

Readers nowadays are no more to be contented with 
an ordinary love-affair in a book than amusement-seekers 
would be with an old-fashioned circus. Mrs. Ellen Olney 
Kirk's latest story for girls, " A Remedy for Love " 
(Houghton), enables the figure to be carried a step fur- 
ther; for she has three several heroes and as many hero- 
ines, — just as the Sells and Ringlings have three rings 
in their great tents. Two of the heroines are young girls, 
just " out " in society, and their lovers are " according," 
as they say in New England ; but the third hero is no less 
a personage than the young girls' widowed papa. The 
book is full of cross-purposes, and all the amusement 
to be legitimately derived from surprises; and, while 
not a remarkable work in any respect, will make good 
reading for those whose age finds the topic engrossing. 

"The Suitors of Yvonne" (Putnam) is Mr. Rafael 
Sabatini's contribution to the cause of the sword-and- 
cloak romance, with Cardinal Mazarin in the lurid back- 
ground to lend historical verity to slashing fighting and 
intermittent but assiduous love-making. A ruffling 
gamester in fortunes sadly reduced; a maid of high 
birth and great expectations surpassing in beauty the 
houris of the Moslem paradise; a rival who is in every 
way suited for the maid, — given these, and the prob- 
lem is presented for solution. It is romance of the 
best possible sort, — romance with the courage of its 
convictions, — and there is not a dull page for the 
reader to yawn over. The world owes a debt of grati- 
tude to the inventor of this sort of literature, — much 
more, in truth, than to this latest exemplar of it, whose 
work was largely done for him by distant predecessors. 



Notes. 



" The Book of Orchids," by Mr. W. H. White, is a 
new volume in Mr. John Lane's rapidly growing series 
of " Handbooks of Practical Gardening." 

Messrs. John Wiley & Son publish a translation of 
Laplace's " Philosophical Essay on Probabilities," the 
work of Professors F. W. Truscott and F. L. Emery. 

The Romanes Lecture for 1902 was given at Oxford 
on the seventh of June by Mr. James Bryce, who took 
for his subject " The Relations of the Advanced and the 
Backward Races of Mankind." This philosophical dis- 



cussion of a peculiarly timely subject is now made 
available in pamphlet form by Mr, Henry Frowde, at 
the Oxford University Press. 

" The Care of the Teeth," by Dr. Samuel A. Hop- 
kins, is a small book, not exactly related to literature, 
but having a useful function. It is published by Messrs. 
D. Appleton & Co. 

Messrs. Jennings & Pye are the publishers of "The 
Doctrines of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Amer- 
ica," a work in two small volumes, compiled and edited 
by Dr. John J. Tigert. 

" St. Luke," edited by Dr. M. R. Vincent, and " Dan- 
iel and the Minor Prophets," edited by Dr. R. Sinker, 
are the latest volumes of the " Temple Bible," as pub- 
lished by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

Miss Clara Tschudi's Life of Marie Antoinette, in the 
authorized translation of Mr. E. M. Cope, is published 
in a second edition by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. The 
work is probably the best popular account of its subject 
to be had. 

" The Poems of Schiller," translated by Mr. E. P. 
Arnold-Foster, are published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. The translation is painstaking but not distin- 
guished, and it is difficult to understand for what pub- 
lic such a work is issued. 

" The Unknown God," an essay by Sir Henry 
Thompson, is a booklet published by Messrs. Frederick 
Warne & Co. This striking essay was first published 
in " The Fortnightly Review " a few months ago, where 
it attracted much attention. 

Mr. B. H. Blaokwell, Oxford, is the publisher of "A 
Primer of Greek Constitutional History " by Mr. A. H. 
Walker. This book is based in part upon the larger 
work of Mr. Greenidge, and is specially planned for 
the needs of the English public-school boy. 

A new edition, in a single volume, of the " Life and 
Letters of Lady Sarah Lennox," reviewed at length in 
The Dial for March 16 last, is published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. The text and illustrations are 
in all respects identical with the original edition in two 
volumes. 

The New Amsterdam Book Co. have just published a 
neat three-volume reprint of the 1814 edition of the 
Lewis and Clark Journals. Portraits of the explorers 
and maps of their route add to the attractiveness of this 
edition, which is, however, simply a reprint without any 
modern scholarly apparatus. 

The first number of " The Gulf States Historical 
Magazine," edited by Mr. Thomas M. Owen, and pub- 
lished at Montgomery, Alabama, presents a highly 
creditable appearance, and betokens anew the growing 
interest of the South in intellectual undertakings. 
The magazine will be issued six times a year, and the 
reputation of the editor as a student of Southern his- 
tory offers a guaranty that the contents will be of value. 
We have seldom seen a more tasteful or attractive 
catalogue than the one just sent us by Messrs. Alex- 
ander Denham & Co. of London, describing the books, 
manuscripts, autographs, and drawings for sale by that 
firm. Beautifully printed at the Chiswick Press, and 
illustrated with numerous reproductions of various sorts, 
it is a publication which the collector will delight in, and 
a model of its kind. The American agent for Messrs. 
Denham & Co. is Mr. E. A. Denham, New York. 

We are glad to note the appearance of a new edition, 
with illustrations, of that sterling romance of Indian 
life in Oregon, "The Bridge of the Gods," by the late 



1902.]

F. H. Balch. The book was published a dozen jears 
ago bv Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., who issue the 
present reprint. It is a work of unusual strength and 
iatereet, and well deserves the success denoted by this 
attnetiTe illustrated edition, which will be welcomed 
bj old admirers of the book and should introduce it to 
a large circle of new ones. The eight full-page pic- 
tures by Mr. L. Maynard Dixon are strong portrayals 
of Indian life and character, well fitting the style and 
spirit of the book.

Important Books on Nature Study 

"The most notable Nature Study book now issued." 

NATURE STUDY AND LIFE 

By CLIFTON F, HODQEt Assistant Professor of Physiology and Neurology in Clark University. Worcester, Mass. With 
an Introduction by Dr. G. Stanley Hall. 12mo. Cloth, xvi-t-514 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.50. 



From Dr. O. STANLEY HALL, President of Clark Uni- 
versity, in his Introduction to the boolc: *' Unlike the authors 
of most of the many nature-study manuals now current, Professor 
Hodge has been for some years the head of a University Department, 
is a specialist in two or more of the fields of biology, and has made 
original contributions of value to the sum of human knowledge. His 
mind thus moves with independence, authority, and unusual command 
of the resources in the field here treated. The author is a bom natur- 
alist, and his love of nature and children, which is infectious, is not 
less but more because he does not forget nature's uses to man." 

ALBERT LEONARD, President of the Michigan System 
of Normal Schools, YpsilantI, Mich.: '^Hodge's 'Nature Study 



and Life ' is one of the most valuable contributions to pedagogical 
literature made within the past decade. It is not too much to say that 
the impulse which this book will give to the cause of nature study will 
be felt for years to come.'* 

E. H. RUSSELL, Principal of SUte Normal School, Wor- 
cester, Mass.: "Far and away the best thing that has been done in 
this line yet.** 

J. R. STREET, Professor of Pedagogy, Syracuse Univer- 
sity, Syracuse, N. Y.: " It is not only revolutionary, it is creative ; 
for it puts life in place of death, and purpose in place of aimlessness 
and listlessness.**

LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 100 



The most interesting, and perhaps the most 
important, among the educational publications 
of the year is the survey of recent progress and 
present conditions made by President Harper 
a few weeks ago, and read by him at the Min- 
neapolis meeting of the National Educational 
Association. The paper was prepared with 
great care and thoroughness, after correspond- 
ence and consultation with over a hundred of 
the best known workers in the educational 
field, and offers a comprehensive account of 
what has recently been accomplished in all the 
main departments of teaching and school ad- 
ministration. It is the work of an expert who 
has had the assistance of many other experts, 
and deserves to be read carefully by every 
American who is engaged in educational work. 

The opening paragraph of this address reads 
as follows : 

" In attempting a survey of the progress of ednca- 
tional work during the period of a single year, one 
qaiekly discovers three or four things : (1) that sach a 
survey will contain no adequate presentation of the 
mass of material which may rightly lay claim to be in- 
claded — a volume of hundreds of pages being hardly 
snfiBcient, much less a paper of forty or fifty minutes; 
(2) that no sharp line can be drawn between different 
years, since the more important events really assume 
the nature of movements, and most of them cover a 
period of several years; (3) that prejudice against 
taking forward steps in education has been greatly di- 
minished, and skepticism as to the value of the old 
conventional usages in schools and colleges is largely 
on the increase; (4) that, whatever may have been true 
in the past, no very close connection any longer exists 
between the educational movements of England and the 
continent, and those of our own land. At all events, 
we may no longer be counted merely as followers; in 
some respects, we may perhaps claim the position of 
leadership." 

If Dr. Harper's hour was inadequate for 
anything like a full presentation of the many 
topics clamoring for attention, our own ten or 
fifteen minutes must be still more inadequate, 
and we will attempt no more than a selection 
of passages, accompanied by a few words of 
brief description and comment. 

The important subject of the training of 
teachers yields the following observations, which 
we believe to be essentially sound : 

*' The teacher is beginning to recognize more clearly 
the importance of study for the sake of information as 
distinguished from that of method study. This differ- 



80 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



ence is the old bone of contention between the normal 
school and the college. A radical step, and one which 
seems to acknowledge this general principle, has been 
taken during the past year in the city of Chicago. The 
city normal school, whose function it is to train teachers 
for the elementary field, has advanced its course of 
study to three years, and has made its requirement for 
admission coordinate with that of the leading colleges 
in the country. . . . This need of broader scholarship 
has nowhere been more deeply appreciated than among 
the teachers themselves, and in testimony of this state- 
ment we need only recall the interest and support of 
that great multitude of elementary teachers who spend 
a part of their vacations in the summer schools and 
colleges. The encouragement of summer study by the 
superintendents of the great cities, and the avidity with 
which such opportunities have been seized, present a 
situation heretofore unknown; and one from which the 
greatest possible results may be expected. It is not 
method study simply that these teachers hunger for; it 
is rather information on special subjects in which they 
have discovered their weakness." 

The sooner the old type of normal school is 
banished from our educational systems, the 
healthier our pedagogical condition will be. 
That normal school work should be, in any radi- 
cal sense, different from the regular academic 
work of the college or other higher institution, 
is one of the most mischievous notions that 
ever obtained a foothold in our educational 
theory. After a while, we shall come to realize 
that pedagogy itself is a good deal of a fetich, 
and that the really educated teacher knows by 
instinct about all that he needs to know of the 
art of teaching. 

The subject of secondary education occupies 
a large space — but not larger than is com- 
mensurate with its importance — in Dr. Har- 
per's survey. 

" It is thought by some of the ablest representatives 
of secondary education in New England that the expe- 
rience of the past year includes as an encouraging fea- 
ture, the change on the part of the colleges to revert to 
the old standards of requirements which laid emphasis 
upon power and discipline rather than upon technical 
knowledge. It is believed that a beginning in this direc- 
tion has already been observed, and that there exists a 
widespread conviction that such a course is required by 
sound doctrine. Certain western institutions have laid 
emphasis upon this point for several years. It is grati- 
fying to note that the recognition of this principle is 
gaining ground in the New England colleges. The 
principle involved is one essential to the best interests 
of secondary education, and unless this principle is 
adopted unreservedly, secondary training will not only 
lose a large share of its value, but in many cases prove 
distinctly injurious. The tendency toward the intro- 
duction of elective work in secondary schools has un- 
questionably increased during this past year. In so far 
as such election is virtually an arrangement of studies in 
groups of closely connected subjects, no exception to it 
may be taken; but to the proposition that the average 
secondary student is able, even with the parents' help, 
to select his subjects, and that such selection, because 



it is an election on his part, is preferable to the group- 
ing of subjects which the best experience has approved, 
the writer desires to enter earnest protest — a protest 
based upon experience with students of a still maturer 
age. It has been my experience, after careful study of 
the facts as brought to light in the operation of dif- 
ferent systems, that the average boy or girl in the 
freshman or sophomore college years exhibits an utter 
inability to make wise decision between various courses 
of instruction. The choice will be determined, in a 
majority of instances, by the hour of recitation, or 
some statement concerning the course by a fellow- 
student. Least of all does he have in mind the rela- 
tionship of the course to the work which lies before 
him. I am, therefore, strongly of the opinion that, 
unless the choice of subject in secondary work is prac- 
tically controlled by the principal, election will prove 
injurious rather than helpful." 

This condemnation of the absurdity of turning 
boys and girls loose upon a course of study, 
to patch up their own programmes in accord- 
ance with their own whims, might profitably 
be made more emphatic than it is ; and with 
the condemnation there should be coupled 
some more or less sarcastic comment upon the 
solemn nonsense which is commonly advanced 
as argument in behalf of the elective system. 
The growth of secondary education in this 
country is one of the most striking phenomena 
of recent years. Within a decade the number 
of high-school students has doubled, the great 
majority of students who enter college come 
from high-schools, the number of such schools 
is increasing rapidly in every state, and the 
scope of the high-school curriculum is being 
extended every year. 

" These schools have come to occupy a unique field 
independent of higher institutions. In many sections of 
the country the work is coordinate with the work of the 
smaller colleges, and the preparatory schools connected 
with the smaller colleges no longer occupy their former 
place of importance and dignity. In fact, the high 
school is rapidly coming to be a rival of the smaller 
college itself. In some states the high school now does 
the work of the freshman year, and even some of the 
work of the sophomore year, this being recognized and 
accepted by the state universities. This tendency, 
while subversive of the relationships which have hitherto 
existed between college and preparatory school, and 
while injurious in the extreme to the growth and de- 
velopment of the smaller college, is a tendency which is 
invaluable and which deserves encouragement. It is a 
movement in the interests of economy, of better sec- 
ondary education, and of better and broader higher 
education. The time is coming when, in every state, 
the leading high schools will carry the work to the end 
of the sophomore year in college. Nothing can be said 
in justification of the policy of stopping at an earlier 
point than this." 

Upon the controverted question of the simpli- 
fication of college degrees. Dr. Harper argues, 
with convincing logic, for the preservation of 



1902.] 



THE JDTATi

the distinction, at present still generally made, 
between the two or three fundamental types of 
intellectual training. 

" There are those who believe that the distiDctioiis 
proposed in the different degrees are distinctions based 
upon real differences; that a course the larger part of 
which is in science may properly be called a conrse in 
Bcieiiee, and the degree given be a degree in science. 
The word 'science' is one which its enthusiastic adro- 
eates should honor by use rather than dishonor by 
rejection. By the side of the old college of arts, the 
characteristic feature of which was the study of the 
classics, there hare grown up two sister colleges: that 
of science, and that of modem history and literature. 
Surely this fact may well be recognized; and nothing is 
gained by adapting the old degree to the new college, 
when it is so easy to employ a degree the name of which 
explains itself. This step can hardly be regarded as a 
forward step in education. The breaking down of real 
distinctions means backward movement, not progreas." 

We thoroughly agree with the writer in this 
opinion, believing that the arts degree has a 
prestige peculiarly its own, which it is entitled 
to preserve. The degree in science may win 
for itself, in some instances has already won 
for itself, a like prestige : but it should not 
nsurp the distinctive badge of a fundamentally 
different discipline. 

The freedom of university teaching finds a 
staunch friend in Dr. Harper, and he sees 
reason for encouragement in the fact that the 
public strongly espouses the cause of the pro- 
fessor who is made, or ever seems to be made, 
the victim of official persecution. 

" Every month of the last twelve months has added 
to the security and permanence of the professor in the 
prosecution of his work. Every month has added to his 
dignity and to the importance which attaches to his 
words. Every month has made it clearer that public 
sentiment is on the side of the professor in any contest 
entered into with the institution of which he is a mem- 
ber. Within five years the sentiment has become almost 
universal that, once a man is appointed to do work in a 
university, the university is responsible for the appoint- 
ment, but not for the views which the man later may 
propound. Gradually, but surely, even the common 
people are coming to perceive the difference between 
the university and the individual professors who form 
its staff. The time has not yet come, to be sure, when 
the people make distinctions of this same kind between 
the president of an institution and the institution itself. 
It is still wrongly understood that the words of a presi- 
dent must be words carrying with them the force and 
inffaence and authority of the university as a whole. 
Ten years from now in the West and Northwest, men 
will be able to make this additional distinction. But 
great has been the progress which has thus far obtained 
in the attitude of the public toward the individual pro- 
fessor." 

A professor may abuse his position by promul- 
gating crude ideas in a sensational way, by 
speaking authoritatively on matters outside of 
his own special department of work, or by as- 



suming a partisan attitude toward controverted 
subjects. But even then his position remains 
sacred. There are only two causes that justify 
a demand for the resignation of a professor in 
full university standing. 

" His resignation will be demanded, and will be ac- 
cepted, when, in the opinion of those in authority, be 
has been guilty of immorality, or when for any reaao* 
he has proved himself to be incompetent to perform the 
aerrice called for." 

In view of the fact that the institution of which 
Dr. Harper is the administrative head has been 
widely, although unjustly, accused of interfer- 
ing with the free expression of opinion, it is 
well that this emphatic disclaimer should be 
made. 

The recent transfer of the control of higher 
education from the clergy to the laity is an im- 
portant development, and invites the following 
comment : 

" In the Association of American Universities only 
one institution is under the administration of a clergy- 
man; that one is the Roman Catholic University at 
Wkshington, and is essentially a theological institution. 
Speoal attention was drawn to this fact in the address 
of Mr. Eliot at the Columbia celebration. The signifi- 
eance of it is self-evident, and, when coupled with the 
fact that so small a number of college graduates in our 
universities now plan for the profession of preaching, 
the significance grows even more startling. Moreover, 
from no quarter, not even from the clergy, do we find 
criticism of this policy. It seems to meet with general 
favor and approval. Surely, if anywhere, the old 
regime would have continued in Princeton; but even at 
Princeton the new policy has been adopted. The fact 
is itself a commentary upon the function and place of 
higher edoeaUon in the public mind. It does not mean 
that our institutions of learning are any less religions 
cither in fact or in theory, for it may be confidently 
■Hiataioed that never, in the history of higher educa- 
titm, has the religious spirit prevailed more widely, or 
extended more deeply, than at present. It does not 
mean that questions of ethics or of philosophy occupy a 
leas prominent place than in former years. It does not 
mean that biblical instruction is now taking a seeondary 
place in comparison with that which it has hitherto oe- 
enpied ; for here again, as everyone knows, never before 
in the history of college education have biblical studies 
occupied the place in academic instruction which they 
hold to-day. But if it does not mean these things, what 
does it mean? Simply that the work of education is 
itself a profession, separate and distinct from preaching. 
In truth, the position of the university president has 
become a unique position, a profession by itself; one the 
demands of which are greater perhaps than those made 
upon any other profession. This new phase is a growth 
of the last two decades. What its future development 
will be no one can prophesy ; but it stands out to-day as 
distinct from the office of the clergy, on the one hand, 
as from that of the specialist in any department of 
science, on the other. The college president must be a 
specialist, and he must also be a generalist. Scholar- 
ship is expected of him; at the same time, thorough 
business training. The capacity for desk work is de-

manded, and, besides, skill in public speaking; and, 
above all, if not knowledge of all things, at least sym- 
pathy with all knowledge. The past year has made 
large contribution to the further differentiation of this 
new character in modern life." 

The closing section of this address is de- 
voted to a consideration of the Carnegie and 
Rhodes foundations — " the two greatest single 
events in the history of higher education dur- 
ing . . . the past ten years." Concerning the 
former of these gifts, after expressing the opin- 
ion that the " gift to Scotch universities up to 
the present time has resulted in far greater 
injury than good to those institutions and to 
the cause of education in that country," Dr. 
Harper goes on to say : 

" The Carnegie fund has been established for re- 
search and ought to contribute largely to institutional 
cooperation; but if, instead of encouraging the work of 
research and investigation as already established in our 
institutions of learning, it endeavors to detach such 
work from those institutions and to gather to itself the 
responsibility and the credit for such work; if, instead 
of strengthening the work where it already exists, it un- 
dertakes to establish new fonndatious, independent of 
these institutions, in order that its own work may be 
more tangible, it will prove to be the greatest curse to 
higher education in this country instead of a blessing." 

With what is said of the Rhodes scholarship 
endowment we are compelled to take sharp 
issue. First of all we read : 

" It the Rhodes scholarships are to be employed to 
detach from the American environment one hundred or 
more young men of special ability each year and trans- 
port them to foreign soil in order to imbue them with 
foreign ideas at an age when they are peculiarly impres- 
sionable; if the purpose of this foundation is to draw 
all men to a recognition of the doctrine of imperialism 
as it is embodied in the British Empire, the execution 
of this trust may prove a curse instead of a blessing to 
those who avail themselves of its privileges." 

This is a piece of ad captandum reasoning 
which has the demagogic flavor of the news- 
paper editorial, and is quite unworthy of the 
president of a great university. We must 
take still more serious exception to what fol- 
lows. When the announcement of the Rhodes 
bequest was made, we at once pointed out that 
our university leaders would probably attempt 
to influence a diversion of the fund from the 
object clearly in the mind of the giver. A 
number of subsequent utterances from univer- 
sity men have already realized our prediction, 
and to this number Dr. Harper's suggestion 
must now be added. In saying that " the 
form of the gift is sufficiently indefinite to 
make it possible to modify the original propo- 
sition and to permit these scholarships to be 
for graduate work rather thau for undergrad- 
uate work," he completely misrepresents the 



terms of the bequest. Both the letter and 
the spirit of the Rhodes will make it perfectly 
clear that the founder had boys in mind — 
public-school boys, and not graduate students 
of universities or even undergraduates. If the 
trustees, acting on the advice of American uni- 
versity men, should seek to evade or to nullify 
this carefully expressed purpose, they would 
be acting in bad faith so manifest that it could 
not be concealed by any sort of rhetorical 
juggling. The plea will not avail that the 
founder would have acted more wisely had he 
provided for a hundred American university 
students ; that is possibly true, but the plain 
fact is that he provided instead for a hundred 
boys from the high schools and academies of 
this country. We cannot believe that the body 
of honorable and responsible men intrusted 
with the execution of these testamentary pro- 
visions will be persuaded to act as President 
Harper suggests that they may act ; the case 
against such a course is too clear, and the 
declared purpose of Cecil Rhodes too evident, 
to warrant us in entertaining this suggestion 
save as a danger against which the trustees 
must be on their guard. 



THE ELECTIVE BOARD OF 
EDUCATION. 



The Educational Commission of Chicago, in a 
recent report to the Mayor who created it, very 
truthfully and cogently said : " The function of a 
board of education, acting under the authority of 
state law, is to represent the people in the establish- 
ment and maintenance of the public school system." 
The report further says that the method of select- 
ing the members of these boards has varied some- 
what under different conditions, but that a large 
majority of the members are elected by the people 
direct. And in a foot-note to its report, the Com- 
mission adds that in fully nine-tenths of the school 
districts of the United States the elective system 
will probably be continued. It is also stated in the 
same report that in the larger cities of this country 
thirteen out of twenty-three obtain their boards of 
education by means of an election by the people. 
Especial reference is made to the last statement, 
because the purpose and scope of this article are 
confined chiefly to boards of education in the larger 
cities, to those school boards whose members serve 
without pay and are not required or expected to 
give much time or energy to the details of school 
work. 

In a system which so vitally and directly concerns 
every family, and almost the entire population of 
the country, it seems unaccountable that the entire

THE DIAL

adult population should not be allowed the right to 
an active and intimat-e participation in some of the 
forms of administration of the affairs of the public 
schools. Self-interest, the interest of the individual, 
is an exceedingly strong moving force. To say, as 
had been said by advocates of the appointive method 
of securing boards of education, that some of these 
interested people do not know enough to exercise 
the right of franchise intelligently and wisely is to 
say, in effect, that a representative form of govern- 
ment is a failure, and the intrinsic value of demo- 
cratic institutions is mainly mythical. The number 
of persons is not large that is quite ready to admit 
that. 

One of the most ptotent arguments in favor of 
the elective board of education is that such a board 
is removed from party politics, and is responsible 
directly to the people, which the apfwintive board 
is not ; and that it compels the people to take an 
active and (ultimately if not immediately) an intelli- 
gent interest in the public schools. Such a board 
is thoroughly democratic ; it comes from the people, 
to serve the (>eople, and is easily approached by all 
the patrons of the school. The appointive method, 
on the other hand, denies to the great mass of the 
adult population the right to an active participation 
in school affairs. If the cause of public education 
were a purely local or class matt«r, it might be per- 
missible to have less than the entire municipality, 
in any other than a representative form of govern- 
ment, for its constituency. But the public school 
system is not intended for a part of the community, 
nor for a class or clique or party. It includes 
among its patrons and friends the entire community ; 
and. in our form of government, it is preeminently 
a democratic institution. Why, then, should it be 
argued that in the large cities, where the average 
of intelligence is probably as high as elsewhere, the 
management of the public schools should be with- 
drawn from the whole people and placed in the 
hands of one person, or of a few persons at most? 
Why should parents and relatives and friends of 
the school children be denied the right of taking 
some interest in matters which so deeply and closely 
concern them and their futuref 

It is said that the functions of the board of edu- 
cation are twofold, — executive and legislative ; and 
* that the executive function is one that must always 
be delegated. This is granted. But shall those 
most interested be denied the right to say how and 
by whom these functions shall be exercised? Is it a 
sufficient answer to say that one man. — the mayor, 
perhaps, who is usually an adept in political meth- 
ods, but too often a mere tyro in practical educa- 
tional methods. — ■ knows better than the whole 
people who will best serve them on a board of edu- 
cation? And is he likely to exercise his knowledge 
and enforce bis (political methods more honestly and 
unselfishly than the entire community would do? 

In a case within the writer's knowledge, where 
appointments were to be made on a board of edu- 
cation, the following were some of the arguments 



and influences used to obtain places on the govern- 
ing board : " I desire to have Mr. A. appointed 
from my own ward," said John Smith, who had 
been instrumental in securing the enactment of the 
new school law ; " he is a particular friend of mine, 
and a good Republican." He was appointed. Mr. 
Smith asked to have Mr. B. appointed from another 
ward. " He has not," said he, " the best educa- 
tional or moral qualifications for the place. In fact, 
he has been implicated in some shady transactions, 
which I do not like to talk about. But there is a 
money difference between Mr. B. and myself, and 
if he gets this appointment the prestige which it 
will give him will make it possible for him to pajr 
me the balance coming to me." He too was ap- 
pointed. Mr. C. was appointed from another ward, 
not, as was stated at the time, '' because he had any 
particular qualifications for the position, but the 
third political party must have at least one repre- 
sentative on the board, and this seems to be the 
only plaee left." Mr. D. was not appointed from 
another ward because another applicant had a 
stronger " pull " with the appointing power. The 
*' puU " in this ease was said to have been that the 
successful party was a profitable client of the ap- 
pointing pMwer. 

It is difficult to conceive of a board of education 
being made up in a more reprehensible manner 
than has here been indicated. It is confidenUy 
asserted that the voting masses would never be 
guilty of motives so low, vicious, and unworthy, in 
easting about for persons to serve them as the 
school officers of a grO't city. 

The Committee of Fifteen, — a committee of 
educational experts, who are doubtless honest and 
siaeere, but who are not believed to be very close 
to the masses, and who take what may be called the 
professional view of the qaestion, — favor the ap- 
pointive board of education. They say. among 
other things : " We are strongly of the opinion that 
in view of the well-known difficulty about securing 
the attendance of the most interested and intelligent 
electors at school elections, as well as because of the 
apparent impossibility of freeing school elections 
from political or municipal issues, the better man- 
ner of elections is by appointment." 

These objections are of questionable validity. 
" The most interested electors " would seem to be 
precisely the ones most likely to be present at 
school elections. Whether or not these electors 
are also " intelligent " may be a matter open for 
investigation. Undoubtedly, the majority of these 
" interested electors " can lay no claim to a college 
edoeation, but they have a tolerably fair under- 
standing of the theory and practical workings of 
a democratic form of government, and are " in- 
telligent " enough to be good citizens. Whether or 
not it is possible, or even desirable, to " free school 
elections from political or municipal issues " de- 
pends very largely on the circumstances and condi- 
tions surrounding each particular case. Unques- 
tionably, any " manner of election " is preferable 



84 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



to appointments made aa has been indicated in 
another part of this article. 

In St. Louis, where there is an elective board of 
education, it is said that "if the school board is 
appointed, the source of power is a political factor 
which will make itself felt in the election and nomi- 
nation of superintendents and echool oflBcers." Here 
is testimony which directly controverts the argu- 
ment of the Committee of Fifteen, by insisting that 
the politics of the situation finds its most pronounced 
exemplification in the appointive rather than in the 
elective plan. 

Dr. William T. Harris, United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, favors boards elected by the 
people, for the reason that such boards are more 
independent than those appointed by the mayor or 
by the courts. He is satisfied, in other words, that 
representation of the people is essential for cities as 
well as for states. In his bird's-eye view of the St. 
Louis public school system, Dr. Harris combats the 
position taken by the Committee of Fifteen in these 
words : " A board elected by the people direct, for 
the special purpose of managing the schools, and 
vested with limited powers of taxation, is sure to 
look after school interests, at least to the extent of 
the popular demand in that direction, and is not 
liable to be diverted from the care of the schools so 
much as to sacrifice them to other municipal inter- 
ests." Certainly this is strong testimony from one 
of the leaders of educational thought in this country, 
one who has been intimately and prominently con- 
nected with the public school system for many 
years. 

The argument of the Committee of Fifteen seems 
to be directed against the elective system chiefly 
because of fear of the contaminating influence of 
the lowest and most reprehensible forms of "prac- 
tical politics." But personal considerations and 
favoritism in the oflBcial selection of school boards 
are far more portentous. If the elective system has 
proper safeguards in its working details, there is 
little danger of harm to the cause of public educa- 
tion. These boards should be large enough to ap- 
portion the work to the different committees, and 
not make the individual burdens great ; each mem- 
ber should be a city officer, with no local or ward 
functions to perform ; nominations should be made 
independently of and without recognition from po- 
litical parties, by nomination papers ; both sexes 
should be allowed to vote and to hold school office ; 
one-third or one-half of the board should be voted 
for at a time, in order that the entire personnel of 
the board may not be changed suddenly. The school 
superintendent should be the servant of the board, 
and elected by it for a term of years. He should 
have much to say about purely professional and 
scientific work, — the selection of text-books ; the 
examination, appointment, and promotion of teach- 
ers ; the construction of school buildings. But these 
functions of the superintendent should not be abso- 
lute. "The court of last resort" should be the 
board of education upon all questions. 



The public school system of this country is ad- 
mittedly among the greatest of its institutions. It 
has become such because it has been administered 
directly by the people. The time is not likely to 
come when the control of our public schools shall 
be withdrawn from the many and placed in the 
hands of a few. It is freely admitted that the ad- 
ministration of our public schools in large cities, like 
the government of our larger municipalities gener- 
ally, has not been wholly successful. Nevertheless, 
the relief must come, in both instances, primarily 
from the people themselves. And any attempt to 
withdraw self-government from the masses will, we 
confidently believe, not lessen but augment the 
dangers which threaten us. A larger patriotism, a 
more unselfish devotion to the cause of public edu- 
cation, will do much to solve the problem. But a 
minimizing of civic duty and responsibility, never.

THE CASE "NOT PROVEN." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The stand taken against the word " proven " by some 
of your correspondents is somewhat amusing. One of 
them says, " The rhetorics are all against it." He might 
have added that most of the dictionaries and text-books 
on English grammar are against it; but that does not 
warrant him in maintaining that the use of the word is 
" a silly affectation of an unreal archaism." Good usage 
is not determined by makers of dictionaries and text- 
books; it must be determined by our best writers, — they 
are our higher courts of appeal. Professor Carruth is 
right: " The dictionary was made for man, and not man 
for the dictionary." The same is true with regard to 
text- books on grammar and rhetoric: we should make 
them servants for us, and not ourselves servants for 
them. 

Good usage in English is simply a matter of fashion. 
We follow, of course, certain general laws ; but these 
laws are flexible, and can be changed at any time that 
force, clearness, ease, or any other condition of our lan- 
guage, may require. To illustrate : the verbs reach and 
teach may, like othe? weak verbs, form the past tense 
by adding either -ed or -t. Why do we say reached, and 
not teachedl or why taught, and not raughtf Children, 
and foreigners who do not speak our language fluently,, 
frequently use the form teached; Chaucer used raught, 
and Shakespeare sometimes used the same form. Raught 
is now out of fashion ; and teached is not yet fashion- 
able, and may never be. Since these verbs in the present 
tense are similar in form and pronunciation, there seems 
to be no logical reason why they should have different 
past tense forms. Your correspondents, who are dis- 
tressed about the growing tendency of our modern 
writers to use proven, may regard this irregularity in 
the tense forms of these two verbs as a " perversion." 
But it is not a perversion; it is perfectly natural — as 
natural as any other fashion. Rule : In English we use 
certain forms and expressions because we use them ; we do 
not use certain other forms and expressions because we do 
not use them.

law, form the past t«nse br a change in the vowel sound ; 
but the syllable -ed, -d, or -t, which is always added in 
the past tense of the weak verbs, is not added, and 
many of the verbs of this class take -en as the perfect 
participle ending. But this law, to<S, is flexible; some 
of the verbs of this class take the weak forms in the past 
tense and perfect participle. Note the following :

If our strong verbs become weak, we may expect our 
weak verbs to take forms analogous to those of the 
strong class. This, too, is perfectly natural. Here are 
a few of these "perversions " which may be distressing 
to some of your correspondents :

■bowed

bought 

The strong perfect participle form of all these weak 
verbs (with the probable exception of buy) can be found 
in standard literature. The strong perfect participle of 
the verb prove is also found, and should of course be 
included in this list. 

The form paxxn is rare. Milton uses it : 
" Bise, rise, uid heave tby rosy head 
From thy coral-povea bed."— Camiu, L 886. 

Foughten, a rare perfect participle form of the strong 
Teihjight, is used by Tennyson whenever the metre or 
rhythm of his verse requires it : 

" Then qoickly from tie/itfUm field he sent 
Ulfia^."— Th* Cowmg tf Artkmr, L 108l 
" And aver ainee the lorda 
Have/oiipUeii like irild beasta aaaang thnwinlTni - Tlhl, L 3(n. 

Boughlen has at present only a colloquial use; but if 
it should become fashionable, — that is, if our reputable 
writers should, by use of the word, find that they can 
add to their verse more emotional effect, or even more 
rhythmical effect, or can add to their prose more emo- 
tional effect, or even a mere mechanical means for 
attaining more force or ease, — it should then have 
equal recognition with foughten. If this form should 
gain recognition in literature it would probably be re- 
garded by purists as a very " distressing perversion," 
because we would then have a verb with a double ending 
for its perfect participle, -t for the weak and -en for the 
strong ending. But this would be no worse than many 
other double forms in our language. Note, for example, 
the double plural in cherubam, a form found in the Bible; 
or the double feminine ending in songstress, a word now 
in good use. 

Your correspondent quoted several sentences in which 
the form proven is used. The very fact that he found 
these examples in the " current issue of one of our better 
magazines," in an " editorial of what may, perhaps, be 
called our leading weekly," and in The Dial, ought to 
convince him that the word is not a " distressing per- 
version." If he will investigate further he will probably 
find that it occurs frequently in much of our best modem 
literature, both prose and verse. I find the following 

in Tennvson: 

" Ko boon is here

The strong perfect participle ending -en, for weak 
verbs, may not be found very often in Browning's verse. 
The style probably does not require it. But the form 
seems to be adapted to Tennyson's verse; and I see no 
reason why he should be condemned for using it. ■ 
Moreover, I see no reason why any other writer should 
be condemned for using it, whenever it is found that it 
is better adapted to his peculiar style than the regular 
weak ending. j g. Snoddt.

POK AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
( To the Editor of Thk Diai..) 
The publication, by Prof. Charles W. Kent, of the 
exercises connected with the unveiling of the bust of 
Edgar Allan Poe in the library of the University of 
Virginia throws much light upon the conduct of the 
poet while a student of that institution, and his reasons 
for leaving it. The records of the University were 
scrutinized for entries bearing upon the charges against 
Poe for which he is so strongly indicted in Griswold's 
memoir. The student days of the accused covered a 
period of ten months in the course of the second year 
(1826) of the University's existence. Professor Kent 
reminds us of the turbulent and unrestrained character 
of university life in Poe's day, by saying that the atten- 
tion of the faculty was directed principally 
" to discipliaing stndents guilty of the use of anient and vin- 
ous liqaors, or of gambling. There were open outbreaks as 
well as petsonal rebellion against ndes. The University 
seemed in imminent peril from within, becaose of the nnre- 
sbnuned wildness, rampant disrespect, and obstreperous con- 
duct of a body of immature young men, who mistook this 
new liberty for license." 

Further on, he says: 

** At one of the numeroos trials conducted by the Faculty 
a entun witness deposed that there were not fifty students 
at the University who did not play cards. With as much 
readiness and no less accuracy he might have affirmed that 
not fifty of the fathers of these students were free from the 
same vice. The sentiments against it in the Faculty could 
not have been unyielding, for in 1825 three out of seven of the 
members wished gambling removed from the infractions pun- 
ished seriously and transferred to the list of minor offences 
punishable by insignificant fines." 

After referring to the countless records of trials of 
students guilty of drunkenness and dissipated conduct, 
the writer adds: 

" But in all these records we nowhere find any mention of 
the name of Edgar Poe ; and when a long list of students sum- 
moned to appear before the Albemarle grand jury was made 
out, Poe was not included, though many of his boon cotn- 
panions were. Poe was not. then, among the offenders known 
to university or civil law, but from the private testimony of 
his collet mates it is evident that he did sometimes play

Beven-np and loo, his favorite games. . . . His partner, after- 
wards a devout clergyman, and his adversaries, including 
frequently two friends who became respectively a well-known 
divine and a pious judge, were far better known to the Uni- 
versity sporting circle than was Poe." 

The testimony of Mr. Wertenbaker, the Librarian, 
seems conclusive as to Poe's practice of gambling. In 
referring to a visit to Poe's room, he is quoted as having 
said: 

" On this occasion he spoke with regret of the large amount 
of money he had wasted and of the debts he had contracted 
during the session. If my memory is not at fault, he esti- 
mated his indebtedness at $2,000, and, though they were 
gaming debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration 
that be was bound by honor to pay at the earliest opportunity 
every cent of them." 

Alluding to this interview vrith the Librarian, Mr. 
Kent declares: 

" Poe's confession to him contains the real reason why he 
never returned to the University. Edgar Allan Poe was not 
expelled, nor dismissed, nor suspended, nor required to with- 
draw, nor forbidden to return, nor disciplined in any wise 
whatsoever, at the University of Virginia ; but Mr. Allan was 
shocked and incensed at the extent of his dishonorable ' debts 
of honor,'— which he at first refused to consider, but finally 
settled, — and determined to put his extravagant foster-son 
in his counting-room." 

The purpose of the editor of this memorial of Poe is 
not to gloss over the irregularities of his student life, 
but rather to show the real facts. It is, and must be, 
regarded as an official vindication of Edgar Allan Poe 
from the suspicion of having been summarily dealt with 
by the faculty of the institution which now treasures his 
name as one of the most illustrious that ever adorned

THE TRANSMUTATIONS OF A WORD. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Over seventy years ago, upon migrating from Mass- 
achusetts to Illinois, I first encountered the strange 
and barbarous word Sockdolager. I soon learned that 
it meant the finishing blow in a flst-fight; a severe 
stroke. Bartlett picked it up for his " Dictionary of 
Americanisms," and told its origin. It is a ludicrous 
transposition of the vocal elements of the word Dox- 
ology. Some wag noticed that the singing of the Dox- 
ology dissolved the worshipping concourse, the purpose 
of the assembling being fulfilled; if the purpose was a 
flght, the finishing blow dissolved the ring of specta- 
tors and abetters. He avoided the possible irreverence 
of a direct comparison of the different meetings by a 
comical metathesis of the sounds of d and s, as the 
Yankee farmer invoked the use of a stout needle upon 
the object of his wrath instead of pronouncing an eter- 
nal doom. Sockdolager answered the purpose as well 
as the more solemn word. 

Bartlett's " Americanisms " and so-called " Sketches 
of Western Life" spread knowledge of the word, 
whose very barbarism made it as noticeable as an In- 
dian. A contributor to the '• Atlantic Monthly " of 
March, 1893 (p. 425), picked up •' socdollager " and 
defined it. Some students of slang imagined a con- 
nection with the verb to slug, and turned it into " slog- 
dollager." English "Punch" quite outdid American 
slangers in 1862, when it invented " slogdollagize " ! 
Someone, with what notion I cannot see, made " stock- 
dollager." As our American dictionaries admit slang 



when duly marked with the bar sinister, sockdolager i» 
to be found in the " Standard " and in the " Interna- 
tional." 

Entering Illinois College in 1840, I found the word 
further transformed. The first syllable only was used 
in our game of "bull-pen," called also "sock-ball." 
Four players, among whom a ball was passed from 
hand to hand, stood at the corners of a square of about 
fifty feet; inside the square four other players danced 
about, who must dodge the swift balls sent at them by 
the players on the corners when these thought that 
they could score a hit. The phrases "sock him" and 
" sock it to him " were used. In this form the word 
reached England, — for the English keep up with 
American slang. It appears in " Hotten's Slang Dic- 
tionary " of 1860. Stormonth (1885) defines " Sock, 
in slang, to knock a man's hat over his eyes and nose 
by a smart blow"; and for this he gives a derivation 
from the Gaelic. Bartlett (edition of 1859) finds thi& 
use of the word local in America, and in Rhode Island 
only. 

But now our western Americanism meets a real En- 
glish word of like meaning. Halliwell finds in western 
England the word sog, a blow; and "Wright's Pro- 
vincial Dictionary " gives sock as a Berkshire word 
meaning to strike a hard blow. Here is the singular 
concurrence in signification of a curtailed western wag- 
gery, — sockdolager shortened to sack, with an English 
provincialism. 

If newspaperdom can confer respectability, sack may 
hold up its head; for a headline in a great Chicago 
daily introduced an extract from Governor Williams's 
message to the legislature of Indiana thus: " How he 
socked it to the Indiana Legislature." In an article 
in " The Atlantic " for June of this year, in discussing 
a style of newspaper editorials which the critic calls 
" editorialene," he names what he deems a favorite 
occupation of certain writers of that stuff, saying " It 
< socks it to the satraps ' at a safe distance." 

The history of the word does not end here. From 
the tendency of people, especially of the illiterate, to 
substitute a familiar word for a similar unfamiliar one, 
sack was changed to soak. I do not remember this 
until after 1870; it must by that time have gained 
sufficient currency to attract my attention to it as no 
longer an idiotism, but an addition to our stock of slang. 
And now it becomes allied with other meanings of soak. 
A thing is soaked to prepare it for further use, or so 
that it may be not stiff but pliant and fit for use; so we 
hear that " A. has it in soak for B." Perhaps here is an 
indistinct consciousness of the English proverbial say- 
ing, " to have a rod in pickle." But people of the class 
that uses this slang are far more likely to have in mind 
the other use of soak, and to mean that the grudge is 
like a thing in the pawnshop. 

All the former uses of sock now are found with 
the later slang. We hear " He soaks him with a hard 
ball," or " Let 'em soak it to him." Probably some 
new forms will spring from this development, as side- 
shoots sprout on a willow. I shall not be surprised if 
in a few years I shall discover that " au old soaker " is 
not a sot ruined by alcohol, but a hard hitter with fists; 
the epithet " old " referring not to age, but to eminence 
in degree, as " a high old time " may be only a debauch 
begun twelve hours before. 

Such is the story of the changes of one word in the 
life-time of one man. Samuel Willard.

Chroxiclks of a Famous Tbavkllkb.* 



So far as material goes, nothing was easier 
than for Mr. E. Burton Holmes to transmute 
himself from the lectare platform into author- 
ship. His pictures had been provided for the 
illustration of his lectures, and his lectures 
had been reduced to writing from the first. 
The combination of the two into seemly toI- 
ames became chiefly a matter of mechanics. 
But it is not so easy to take up the respon- 
sibilities of authorship and carry them to a 
successful issue. It has become a generally 
accepted belief among critics that stories which 
sound well in the telling often sound ill in the 
reading ; and the reverse is quite as true. Sub- 
tract the personality of the speaker from many 
a man famous in the pulpit or on the rostrum, 
and his ringing periods appear in cold print as 
vacnons, jejune, and incoherent. Mr. Holmes's 
very success before large audiences in every 
part of the United States made this danger a 
real one in his case. 

But it is a danger that may be dismissed. 
As the extracts presently to be given from his 
printed books will attest, he has a clear and 
forceful if somewhat ornate style ; his writing 
everywhere is informed by a keen sense of the 
beauties of art and nature, and of the poetry in 
the universe ; and his keen powers of obser- 
vation and comparison supplement a soond 
intellectual training in enabhng him to bring 
before his readers, as before his auditors, the 
beauties and fascinations of the scenes he has 
chosen for celebration from travels in many 
and far countries. In effecting this result, the 
photographs taken by himself or under his 
immediate supervision in almost every instance 
play an intimate and important part, connect- 
ing themselves with the subject-matter in a 
way seldom attained in any book. 

Each of the ten volumes which are to form 
Mr. Holmes's completed work contains about 
four hundred pages and as many reproduced 
photographs. In each are three lectures, on 
countries geographically related, a fine colored 
plate serving as the frontispiece for every lec- 
tare. The first volume deals with the northern 
coast of Africa, its component parts entitling 
themselves " Into Morocco," " Fez, the Me-

tropolis of the Moors," and " Through the 
Heart of the Moorish Empire," respectively. 
Here, as throughout the work, may be found 
displayed a keen sense of humor, never coarse, 
never indiscriminate, but interpreting the dif- 
ferences of the foreigner in a manner hardly 
possible otherwise. The following anecdote is 
illustrative : 

" Here we may recall the story of the English clergy- 
man, who, touched at the sight of all this misery and 
ignorance, resolved to tell the gospel-story to the peo- 
ple of Tangier — to make a pnblic exhortation in the 
market place. With the greatest difficulty he secnred a 
capable interpreter, for most of the hotel guides feared 
to assist him in his rash and dangerous crusade. When 
the pious preacher began bis sermon in the marketplace, 
be was not only surprised, but thoroughly delighted at 
the reverence with which his glowing words, translated 
by his guide, were received by the attentive throng of 
Moslems. When he had finished, be was even urged to 
speak again. Undoubtedly the good man carried away 
a soul filled with joy because of the good seed he had 
planted here. One English newspaper chronicled the 
marked interest shown by the heathen in the words of 
Christian truth; but it is to be hoped that the good 
man will never learn that while he stood in the centre 
of this meeting-place and spoke, his diplomatic inter- 
preter and guide not only held the respectful ears of 
the crowd, but possibly saved the missionary's life by 
cleverly turning the orthodox sermon into one of the 
favorite romances from the ' Arabian Nights.* " 

When in Fez it was Mr. Holmes's privilege 
to attend a dinner given by the Moorish Secre- 
tary of the Treasury, " one of the highest and 
by a curious coincidence one of the richest 
dignitaries in Morocco," as he observes. This 
is what happened, after the party was seated at 
the table — a concession to prejudices against 
squatting on the floor : 

" There appeared a huge round platter, three feet in 
diameter, on which had been erected a pyramid of 
chickens. To each of us an entire bird was given. 
Then our host, with deft fingers, tore bis portion very 
neatly into shreds, picked out the choicest morsels of 
the chicken and passed them to us. Then followed 
pyramids of pigeons, then huge chunks of mutton, then 
sausages on spits; and that these sausages were not less 
than two inches thick and one foot long I am positively 
certain, because we each were compelled to take a whole 
one, and I remember my vain efforts to get it all upon 
m V plate, three inches of protruding sausage threatening 
the table-cloth on each side. And every course was 
carved by our host, who used nothing sharper than his 
finoremails, and every time he came upon a morsel of 
especial daintiness, he courteously offered it to one of 
us. We were almost stuffed to death, for the consul 
warned us that to refuse the proffered tidbits would be 
a great affront. There were no sauces, no vegetables, 
nothing but meats roasted underground by slow fires 
that had burned all night. We had nothing with which 
to wash down this ' all too solid ' food except sickly 
lukewarm rosewater. And not content with stuffing us 
and forcing us to drink that perfumed Uquid, our host 
would every now and then give a signal, whereupon the

servants would spray rosewater down our backs and in 
our ears. Never was anything more welcome than the 
tiny cups of Turkish coffee that at last were brought to 
ead our torture." 

The second volume is concerned with Paris 
entirely, — one of the lectures with the city 
in general, and two with the Exposition of 
1900. The third volume deals first with the 
Olympian games in April, 1896. More re- 
mindful and interesting souvenirs of these events 
could hardly be devised. The third volume, 
in addition to the Olympian games (the third 
modern Olympiad is to be celebrated in Chi- 
cago in 1904) contains an account of numerous 
ramblings through Greece andThessaly, taking 
the reader to most of the spots famous in clas- 
sical times. The fourth volume returns at 
first to the northern coast of Africa, treating 
of Algiers and other cities of the Barbary 
States. Mr. Holmes falls into an error in his 
dates when he speaks of the suppression of 
piracy as not taking place " until the then 
young American republic, emerging victorious 
from the War of 1812, had expended a little 
of her surplus energy in chastising the high sea 
robbers." Wandering afield among the Ka- 
byles, we can sympathize with Mr. Holmes in 
the following : 

" Imagine my surprise upon being accosted in one of 
these villages by a smiling Kabyle, who exclaimed with 
a distinctly American accent, 'Ah there, mister! I saw 
you on the Midway.' The speaker has spent six months 
in Chicago selling Kabyle jewelry at the World's Fair." 

The succeeding lecture, on the " Oases of 
the Algerian Desert," deals with the Roman 
ruins of Timgad, the ancient Thamugas, and 
with the unexpectedly pleasant city of Biskra, 
proving to the American man of the cities that 
the comforts of home were sometimes nearer 
than he thought, as in this instance : 

" When weary of dreaming in the garden, we may 
take a spin in the horse-ear of Biskra, for this unique 
oasis is not without its progressive institutions. But 
the rails are very badly laid, and every few hundred 
yards there comes a lurch, followed by the suggestion 
of an earthquake, whereupon the French conductor po- 
litely requests the passengers to assist in replacing the 
car upon the rails. Thus a street-car ride, which with 
ns is a passive enjoyment, becomes to the Biskran an 
excellent form of training for both nerve and muscle." 

On this ride appears an amusing illustration 
of the same instincts that lead the man of civili- 
zation in America to buy fish to take home from 
an expedition near some stream, making the 
needful variations for a changre of skies. 

" Having passed the limits of the oasis, we behold 
close to the track upon a hillock a sight which makes 
our blood run cold — a gigantic lion, crouching as if 
about to spring. My friend feels for his revolver; I 



look despairingly at the distant palm-trees; the other 
passengers sit motionless, their faces expressive only of 
calm interest. We begin to doubt the excitability of 
the French. The car is brought to a standstill. With 
a painfully deliberate slowness a man in hunting costume 
takes a gun from beneath the seat. This reassures us; 
but why does he not make haste to shoot ? Why does 
he wait for that fool of a photographer who is setting 
up his tripod in the face of such a danger ? In wonder 
we await the denouement. The man draws near with 
superhuman coolness; the huge beast, daunted, bows 
his head. The hunter stands over him in an attitude 
of victory. The photographic artist — a veritable hero — 
then secures proofs of the courage of the lion-tamer. 
And then at last the truth breaks in upon us as two 
poor Arabs appear, calmly tie a rope around the lion's 
neck, and serenely lead away the desert king. The 
poor old beast is blind and tame and harmless. His 
keepers make a living by renting him to amateur pho- 
tographers or to ambitious sportsmen desirous of send- 
ing home convincing ' proofs ' of their prowess." 

The last of the three lectures in this fourth 
volume has to do with southern Spain, and the 
inevitable bull-fight. Here there is a wholly 
unexpected conclusion ; for when Mr. Holmes 
came from the arena and saw the horses — 
seventeen in number — that were lying dead 
as the result of a Spanish holiday, " What do 
they do with all these bodies ? " he asked of a 
boy standing by, and was promptly told, in 
Spanish, " Oh, they make sausages and ship 
them to America." And there was a pretty 
neat adaptation of an old phrase by a gypsy 
boy who replied to Mr. Holmes's statement that 
he was going to Paris — " O Paris! el ultimo 
suspiro del Americano " (the last sigh of the 
American). 

The fifth volume takes up the two archipel- 
agoes in the Pacific which have fallen under the 
American flag. Mr. Holmes is not in the least 
concerned with the political or economical as- 
pects of Hawaii or the Philippines, — indeed, 
he could not very well be, — but there are 
many questions quite unanswered in his lec- 
tures. These chapters are divided from one 
another by an intermediate discourse on " The 
Edge of China," Hong Kong being inhabited 
in part by Admiral Dewey and Lieutenant 
Hobson at the time of his arrival there. Some 
of the problems awaiting us are outlined in the 
remarks on the Sandwich Islands.. 

" It is said that the Hawaiian people numbered 
400,000 when the islands were discovered, and to-day 
there are scarcely 30,000 of them left. Fifteen years 
ago there were not a hundred Japanese in the islands. 
To-day Japan is represented by 23,000 of her hard- 
working peasants and her shrewd business men. China 
has sent more than 20,000 pig-tailed natives hither. 
Fifteen thousand Portuguese are now competing with 
them."

Philippine Islands outside of Manila, when he 
was there in 1899. In fact, he saw part of a 
combined land and naval attack by the forces 
of the United States in Bacoor Bay, while 
lying in quarantine in the harbor of Manila. 
The Filipino patriots were still in possession 
of the entire archipelago, with the exception 
of the capital city, — and they would doubtless 
have had that, if Dewey had not prevented 
them from driving Spain out of its last foot- 
hold in the group. Naturally, when he went 
ashore he associated with the Americans of the 
«ity, and these were almost all army officers. 
Some Americans are becoming dimly aware of 
the fact that the army and navy of any country 
are as favorable to war, professionally, as the 
lawyer is to clients, the physician to patients, 
or the priest to penitents. They were not 
questioning the liberation of the Filipino na- 
tion by the simple process of shooting all of 
its members who believed that the " consent 
of the governed " was in some way essential 
to government by Americans. Nor does Mr. 
Holmes question it ; nor can he be blamed 
greatly, depending upon public favor as he 
does, if he goes a little out of his way to attest 
his sympathy with our Army of Liberation. 
There is a certain smugness in the following, 
however, which is not wholly pleasant : 

" It is not mv province to discuss the iafiaence for 
good or evil of these Spanish friars in the Philippines. 
Their rale is ended, and the church, at last awake to 
their shortcomings in the past, will, without doubt, 
ander the guidance of American Catholics, transform 
the institutions which the friars have founded and fos- 
tered in the Philippines into agencies for future good." 

There is no hint here, as there is none in the 
usual American newspaper of to-day, that the 
government of the United States has adopted 
in the most solemn manner, by the Treaty 
of Paris, the friars as her own, and stands 
pledged before the world to place them not 
only in full possession of all their temporal 
rights and properties, but to secure them in 
the full performance of all their spiritual 
functions, — one of the several untoward re- 
sults of the refusal to permit any native Fil- 
ipino to have a voice in the provisions of this 
Treaty of Paris, when we paid 120,000.000 
for 9,000,000 of him. If what Mr. Holmes 
savs is true. — and there is not the slightest 
proof of it, up to this moment, — America has 
been as shamefully remiss in carrying out its 
treaty obligations as she has been in securing 
human rights to the native population. The 
position of the Church, meanwhile, is impreg- 
nable ; and the only possible attitude of the 



American government toward the Papacy is 
one of abject pleading to be released from the 
effect of the treaty it deliberately entered into 
with its eyes wilfully shut. Some of the "new 
diplomacy " seems more lurid than effulgent. 
In the last volume published, the sixth, Mr. 
Holmes gets back to safe ground once more, — 
that of his own country. He calls the volume, 
aptly enough, the " American Wonderland," 
and therein informs us of the Yellowstone 
Park, the Grand Canon of the Colorado, and 
the Snake Dance of the Moki Indians. The na- 
tional reservation, fifty-five by sixty-five miles 
in extent, which takes in the geysers, lakes, 
forests, and rivers of the Yellowstone region, is 
a severe test of anyone's powers of description, 
but its difficulties are not to be compared with 
those attendant on giving the outer world 
some adequate notion of what the Grand Canon 
of Arizona really is to the bystander. At the 
beginning of this arduous undertaking, none 
the easier for being self-imposed, Mr. Holmes 
confesses his own failure, as well as the failure 
of his photographic apparatus, to delineate the 
singular majesty of this greatest of natural ex- 
hibitions. He makes his meaning clear enough, 
however, when he writes : 

■■ I believe that when we behold that scene for the 
first time, a series of new biun-oells are [tte] generated, 
and until they have become sufficientlj developed, the 
ea&on withholds its message. In the average mind there 
is no place for an impression so unlike anv before re- 
ceived. At first sight the mentality is dazzled. He 
who looks but once sees not the canon. He who would 
know its glory most first prepare the tablets of his 
mind, — erase all preconceived images, and then witii 
reverence approach the brink, and sitting there day 
after day teach his blind eyes and blinder sense to read 
through the medium of feeling the exalted message 
which this supremest of earthly scenes imprints upon 
the soul." 

Mr. Holmes wisely avails himself of the lan- 
guage of Captain Clarence Edward Dutton, 
soldier and geologist, when he says : 

" ' It is useless to select special points of contempla- 
tion. The instant the attention lays hold of them it is 
drawn to something else, and if it seeks to recur to them 
it cannot find them. Everything is superlative, trans- 
cending the power of intelligence to comprehend it. 
There is no central point around which the other ele- 
ments are grouped and to which they are tributary. 
The grandest objects are naerged in a congregation of 
others equally grand. If any one of these stupendous 
creations had been placed upon the plains of eentral 
Europe, it would have influenced modem art as pro- 
foundly as Fujiyama has influenced the decorative art 
of Japan. Yet here are hundreds of them swallowed 
up in the confusion of multitude.' " 

Yet it is not too much to say, these apolo- 
gies having been duly made, that this lecture 



90 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



does succeed, with its word-painting and pho- 
tographic views, in really awakening in the 
student a conception of what it is that the 
canon is to mean to him when gazed on with 
living eyes and without artificial aids to appre- 
hension. No single sentence, nor paragraph, 
nor page, nor illustration, can be taken as 
typical of the means adopted to secure this 
admirable and praiseworthy result, but the 
article as a whole does go far toward its suc- 
cessful accomplishment. 

The last lecture comes, after this, as some- 
thing of an anti-climax, though it is well told, 
and does not in any particular exceed Mr. 
Holmes's really remarkable and evidently 
growing powers of description. It may be 
hoped, for all that, that at some future day 
another visit will be paid the Grand Canon, 
and another attempt made to master its won- 
ders and glories with riper powers and more 
accustomed hand. And the wish may also be 
expressed that an index of the entire work will 
be inserted at the close of the final volume, 
making it as serviceable for future reference as 
it is for present enjoyment while one is turning 
its attractive pages. Wallace Rice. 



"The Idbal. Roman Senator."* 



It is a far cry from the formerly accepted 
view of the Emperor Tiberius to that of Mr. 
J. C. Tarver, who can even find in him "the 
ideal Roman Senator." His reign has been very 
generally held in the past as a notable example 
of the evils possible to a degenerate despotism. 
According to Mr. Tarver, the world has seen 
few rulers comparable to this same Tiberius in 
all the qualities which secure justice and peace 
and prosperity to the governed and deserve to 
be rewarded with affection and respect for the 
governor. It is known to most people, though 
Mr. Tarver reveals little if any knowledge in 
that direction, that the extremely unfavorable 
view has long since challenged seriously inju- 
rious criticism. Dr. Sievers and Adolf Stahr, 
in Germany, plead strongly for a more favor- 
able view about half a century ago. Others, 
in Germany, England, and America, have 
wrought effectively in the same line, including 
Furneaux, the Clarendon Press editor of Taci- 
tus, and the late Professor William F. Allen, 
whose edition of the first six books of the An- 
nals is more generally used than any other.

Archibald Constable <& Co. New York : £. P. Datton <& Co. 



But just as the soundest scholarship has al- 
ready rejected many of the worst features of 
the old portrait as unhistorical, so it will surely 
reject the little less than saintly figure which 
comes to it under the name of Tiberius from 
the pencil of Mr. Tarver. If one may reason 
back from results to probable methods, it might 
seem that Mr. Tarver began by building up an 
ideal Tiberius upon the foundations laid in the 
eulogy by Velleius Paterculus. Afterward, one 
might imagine, he discovered with indignation 
that one Tacitus, regarded by many as an his- 
torian of some power, had taken a view of the 
subject in many respects radically different. 
Tacitus is therefore relegated to the position of 
a malignant pamphleteer, utterly incompetent 
to write history, powerful only to obscure the 
truth by the diabolical ingenuity of his master- 
fully deceptive rhetoric. The wickedness of his 
assault on the good, the merciful, the wise Ti- 
berius, is enhanced by the fact that it was not 
really Tiberius whom he was after, Domitian 
being the inferential goal of his bitterness. 
When Mr. Tarver finds something in Tacitus 
peculiarly damaging to Tiberius if true, his 
mind seems automatically to go through some 
such logical process as this : " Tacitus may 
have found this in the Memoirs of the younger 
Agrippina; therefore he must have found it 
there, and therefore he did find it there. Now 
Agrippina would naturally have lied about Ti- 
berius in any case ; therefore she probably lied 
about him in all cases, and we may conclude 
with certainty that she did lie about him in 
this particular case." The result of such an 
attitude of mind toward the chief Roman au- 
thority for the reign of Tiberius is a book 
which cannot be seriously regarded as an im- 
portant contribution to Roman history. 

If Mr. Tarver had taken pains to give Taci- 
tus a careful and unbiassed reading before 
taking up his own pen, he would have written 
a different book. The unjust severity of the 
condemnation visited upon Tiberius by gener- 
ations past was based not so much upon what 
Tacitus really says as upon the carelessness 
with which Tacitus was read and interpreted. 
The rehabilitation of the Emperor's character, 
so far as a truthful rehabilitation is possible, 
depends almost entirely upon the Annals of 
Tacitus; and the work will be done most ef- 
fectively by one who goes to the text unblinded 
by the presupposition of devilish malignity in 
an author who, with all his strong feeling as 
to the right or wrong of the transactions re- 
corded, tried always to be fair.

Students of far better temper and higher 
qualifications than are displayed by Mr. Tar- 
ver have found in the life and character of 
Tiberius a problem incapable of any entirely 
satisfactory solution. It is plain enough that 
Tacitus himself, with a much larger fund of 
evidence than is accessible to modern investi- 
gators, found it a point of great difficulty. To 
hold with Mr. Tarver that the supposed reign 
of terror which characterized his later years is 
a pure myth, based upon the slanders of dis- 
appointed members of the imperial household 
and Koman nobles embittered because he had 
wrested from them the privilege of plundering 
the Provinces, is to hold against inherent prob- 
ability as well as positive evidence. The cloud 
overhanging those last years will not clear 
away, and the real problem is to reconcile 
it with equally certain facts as to the long 
years preceding. Tacitus admits — or, rather, 
positively states — that Tiberius led a life 
without reproach, according to the standards 
of the time, up to a point when radical changes 
of character for the worse are extremely rare. 
We say " according to the standards of the 
time," that no one may unconsciously follow 
Mr. Tarver in the assumption that what we are 
told of Tiberius warrants us in crediting him 
with the highest modern standards of spotless 
purity, up to the approach of old age. Any 
tribute to masculine character in the period in 
question would have to be very emphatic and 
very specific to warrant such interpretation. 
After Tiberius reached the throne, Tacitus 
finds signs of deflection from his former stand- 
ards, a hateful cruelty becoming prominent 
during the career of Sejanus, and cruelty and 
lust together dominating the years which re- 
mained after Sejanus had fallen. Tacitus can 
account for this puzzling transformation in an 
old man only on the theory that the virtue of 
the former years was a mere veneering, as- 
sumed for the sake of policy, and that the catas- 
trophe at the close was but the breaking out of 
natural instincts always present though so long 
and so successfully restrained. 

We have already said that Tacitus himself 
seems aware of the difficulty of such an ex- 
planation. The careful student of to-day feels 
it still more, but he feels no less the difficulty 
of the assumption than a man of so high a 
level of character and attainment as Tiberius 
appears to have maintained could in his old 
age have fallen into the position of a cruel 
reprobate. The best suggestion yet made is 
that which finds the explanation in the taint 



of insanity present in the Clandian family. A 
cold, suspicious nature, thrown off its mental 
balance, could easily reach any depth of cru- 
elty, and all the more so when in possession 
of irresponsible power. And with the same 
lack of a well-balanced mental restraint, a 
serious perversion of the sexual instincts, even 
in old age, is not so far out of the range of 
human probability as in itself to discredit evi- 
dence otherwise apparently reliable. 

Mr. Tarver writes with a strong bias in 
favor of a genuinely monarchical government. 
In his view, Tiberius made about his only 
serious mistake in attempting to emancipate 
the Senate from his own control (an attempt, 
by the way, which Tiberius never really made 
at all). A congress or parliament is to him 
merely a " debating society," absurd as a gov- 
erning body and useful only as it becomes a 
puppet in the hands of some managing power. 
He is incapable of realizing that anything of 
real value was lost when Rome passed into the 
hands of a single ruler. In all this he simply 
carries certain present tendencies of thought to 
the extreme, and may do some good in the way 
of stimulating a needed reaction against the 
tendencies themselves. y^^ jj, Johnson. 



"The Rexding of "Virginia."* 

A portion of Mr. Granville Hall's history 
of " The Rending of Virginia " is serviceable, 
inasmuch as it preserves official papers neces- 
sary to a judicial treatment of its subject ; but 
the book itself is far from being written in a 
judicial manner. The strong anti-slavery and 
anti state-rights sentiments of the author color 
the whole treatment. The terms " Rebellion " 
and " Conspiracy " are met with passim, and the 
State of Virginia is not even given credit for 
logical sincerity in her advocacy of secession, 
the whole matter being treated as but an illegal 
pro-slavery movement. It is too late in the day 
for such a one-sided treatment of secession, and 
even impartial Northern critics are coming to 
admit as much. 

But the chief burden of this large volume 
of over 600 pages is an effort to show that the 
formation of the State of West Virginia was 
justifiable and constitutionally legal. This is 
a point of view that might be discussed at 
length, but lack of space forbids. The act for 
the admission of West Virginia into the Union

was passed by a vote of 23 to 17 in the Senate, 
and 96 to 55 in the House of Representatives. 
When it reached the President, he requested 
the opinions of his cabinet officers, and the 
cabinet was equally divided, — Messrs. Seward, 
Chase, and Stanton holding that the act was 
constitutional ; Messrs. Welles, Blair, and 
Bates, that it was unconstitutional in that the 
State of Virginia had never given her consent 
to the division. A brief quotation from the 
opinion of Attorney-General Bates must suf- 
fice. He says (p. 494) : 

" The act of consent is less in the nature of a law 
than of a contract. It is a grant of power; an agree- 
ment to be divided. And who made the agreement ? 
The representatives of the forty-eight counties with 
themselves. Is that fair dealing ? Is that honest leg- 
islation ? Is that a legitimate use of a constitutional 
power by the legislature of Virginia ? It seems to me 
that it is a mere abuse, nothing less than an attempted 
secession, hardly valid under the flimsy forms of law." 

The cabinet being thus evenly divided, the 
President had to decide for himself, after all ; 
and his opinion is simply a case of special plead- 
ing, through which any constitutional lawyer 
could "drive a coach and four." Mr. Thaddeus 
Stevens, in the House, " took the bull by the 
horns." He said (p. 478) that he " was not 
deluded by the idea that we are admitting this 
State in pursuance of the Constitution of the 
United States." " It was a ' mockery ' to say 
that the Legislature of Virginia had con- 
sented." He held, therefore, " that the State 
of Virginia had never given its consent ; but 
this might admit West Virginia, not by virtue 
of any provision of the Constitution of the 
United States, but under one absolute power 
which the laws of war give us in the circum- 
stances in which we are placed." He should 
"vote for the bill on that theory, and that 
alone." This theory is at least intelligible, and 
less specious than seeking constitutional argu- 
ments for an unconstitutional act. 

We have no space to notice the seizure vi et 
armies of the counties of Berkley and Jeffer- 
son, for which there was not even the pretended 
consent of the few counties assumed to form the 
State of Virginia. The formation of the State 
of West Virginia was a CaBsarean operation, not 
a natural birth, and can only be defended by 
the excuse, as Mr. Stevens held, of the " war 
power " — that convenient excuse for many 
other questionable acts. A very different view 
of " The Dismembership of Virginia " will be 
found in an article with this title, written by 
Mr. William Baird, of Essex county, Virginia, 
originally printed in the " Publications of the 



Southern Historical Association " (January, 
1898), and in a revised and enlarged form in 
the " Southern Historical Society Papers " 
(Vol. XXVI., 1898). 

Mr. Hall gives (p. 535) a list of members 
of the Virginia State Convention of 1861 ; but 
the name of Hon. Muscoe R. H. Garnett, M.C., 
is omitted, and there are several misprints in 
the list, as there are, indeed, throughout the 
volume, one of the most vexatious being in the 
Preface (p. 14), George Nelson for George 
Mason, which will not mislead any Virginian, 
though it may mislead other readers. The 
work may serve as memoires pour sev'oir, but 
it is far from being such a " History " as one 
might expect from a participator in the events 
recorded. A more judicial temper is needed, 
for history does not let itself be written from a 
partisan point of view. 

The lack of an index interferes very much 
with the use of the volume.

The Yale Bi-Centenxial, and 
Comparative Philology.* 



Four volumes of the Yale Bi-Centennial 
publications serve, or might well serve, as a 
memorial to William Dwight Whitney, the 
man who won recognition for American schol- 
arship as Franklin won recognition for Amer- 
erican nationality. These are the volumes that 
deal with certain phases of Indo-European 
philology and general linguistics associated 
with the name of Whitney. 

The volume that would suggest the work of 
Dr. Whitney to the widest circle of readers is 
Professor Oertel's " Lectures on the Study of 
Language." So swift is the march of science 
that its right of publication cannot be ques- 
tioned thirty-five years after the appearance of 
" Language and the Study of Language," and 
twenty-seven years after the appearance of the 
" Life and Growth of Language." In those 
thirty-five years highly important investiga- 
tions and statements of principle have come

maDD, Osthoff, Leskien, Sievers, Paul, Sweet, 
Delbriick, Gustav Meyer, and Hirt. Xo book 
of a generation ago has weathered these years 
as have the two books of Whitney ; they can 
even now confidently be placed in the hands of 
students. But, essentially sound as they are, 
they are not of to-day. Professor Oertel's book 
is. In fact, it is everywhere peeping into the 
to-morrow of the science. The latest investi- 
gations and the present state of controversies 
are duly registered. In other words. Profes- 
sor Oertel is writing for the serious student of 
his science, the future bearers of its doctrines. 
Herein lies the strength and the comparative 
weakness of his book. It will have no such 
wide appeal as Professor Whitney's lyceum 
statements, and its very timeliness bears within 
it the stigmata of early eld. However, these 
are the accidents of the book. Its style is clear, 
its method logical, its subject-matter full and 
weighty, its vision wide and distinct. It is an 
admirable book of authoritative instruction, 
and as such will commend itself to an increas- 
ing body of students including many who are 
not, and do not care to be, specialists. Of the 
five lectures, the first, " Historical Introduc- 
tion," and the last. " Semantic Changes." hold 
unchallenged possession of the field, so far as 
any discussions in the English language are 
concerned. But the book as a whole, even by the 
side of Paul's " Prinzipien, " von Gabelentz's 
" Sprachwissenschaft, " the two recent books 
by Sweet, and (to be catholic in our summary) 
the philosophical discussion by Wundt, has 
quite independent value. 

"India. Old and New," by Professor E. 
Washburn Hopkins, consists of a series of 
essays and addresses of a more popular char- 
acter. Its scope is wide, and shows again how 
varied the answer may be to the question, 
" What can India teach us ? " Whether we 
deal with origins or with present-day problems, 
with literature, philosophy, religion, or poli- 
tics, India has some message for us, some prac^ 
tical hint, touched usually with a poetic charm, 
which appeals to both reasou and imagination. 
The first three essays, — " The Rig Yeda," 
"The Early Lyric Poetry of India," and 
" Sanskrit Epic Poetry,'" — deal with the lit- 
erary phases of old India in a manner that 
combines scholarly disquisition with popular 
illustration and summarizing. "A Study of 
Gods '' illustrates how the far past is still living 
in India to-day. " Christ in India " is a closely 
reasoned reply to the theory that Christianity 
is borrowed from Buddhism, a fine piece of 



scholarly writing that is not an example "of 
the style in which grave historical subjects are 
treated by certain debaters, whose object does 
not seem to be to arrive at truth, but only to 
convince others." The ensuing chapters, on 
"Ancient and Modern Hindu Guilds," *• Land- 
Tenure in India," " The Cause and Care of 
Famine," and " The Plague," fix our attention 
more and more upon the living and throbbing 
question of modern India. The volume, to 
which is prefixed a memorial address in honor 
of Professor Salisbury, closes with an epilogue, 
or rather peroration, upon new India, from 
which we quote : 

"For, thanks to England, there is a New India, no 
loDger enslared but free, no longer blinded but en- 
lightened, not perfect but striring for perfection, weak 
but great, potentially strong, awaking to-day to the fnll 
consciousness of a glorious past and the posubility of a 
still more glorious future. Old India endured and 
dreamed of God. Her bastards revile and dream of 
themselves. Bnt New India thinks, her dream is of the 
future. And what is this noble dream? She dreams not 
of independence, bnt of political equality based on moral 
likeness. She seeks to prove that in fiscal and judicial 
administration all native officials can, without Europeaa 
supervision, be as incormptible as are British officiala, 
claiming that to proved ability and integrity is due a 
recognition of the Indian's right to share in the gov- 
ernment of the Indian's country. So may her dream 
be aocomplisbed, and may England, even at some seem- 
ing cost, be ready to meet her halfway, proving in her 
turn, and before it is too late, that she eaiea leas for 
revenne than for righteoaww," 

One misses in the book the eloquence of the 
late Max Miiller, but the sobriety of tone 
inspires confidence in the writer's solidity and 
authority, and the book is throughout readable. 

" The Great Epic of India," by the same 
author, is a rather voluminous special investi- 
gation. It embraces a minute analvsis of the 
Mababharata, its contents and metres, and 
thus arrives at a tenable view of the origin and 
constitution of the epic. The general student 
will be interested in the summaristic statement 
that " there is no ' date of the epic ' which will 
cover aU its parts (though hand-book makers 
may safely assign it in general to the second 
century B.C.)." 

Professor E. P. Morris's book "On Prin- 
ciples and Methods in Syntax " is also a 
special study, but one that may well detain us 
somewhat longer. For the book is written 
with special reference to Latin ; and most of 
us who teach language, or deal with it seriously, 
derive our syntactic organum, for better or 
worse, from our study of Latin. Professor 
Morris has gone resolutely to work to clear 
away the prepossessions that have robbed

studies in syntax of the fullest results. A 
first reading leaves one with a tinge of pes- 
simism. But closer reading, and a little after- 
thought, shows that the book is even keener 
and surer in its suggestions and directions 
than in its criticism. The net result is a body 
of working principles that cannot but lead to 
productive work. Of his main contention the 
author has given a brief summary in a para- 
graph contributed to Professor Oertel's book. 
" It may be laid down as a general rule that the sig- 
nificance of every concrete case form, mode form, or 
tense form depends to a considerable degree on their 
setting and on the meaning of the word to which case, 
mode, or tense endings have been added. So that it is 
really incorrect to speak of the meaning of the ablative 
ending (e. g., -o) or of the subjunctive ending (e. g., -am), 
as if all the meaning rested upon them. We ought 
to speak of the meaning of the ablative ending -o with 
such and such nouns, and of the subjunctive ending 
-am of such and such verbs. Even the person, in the 
latter case, would be an important semantic element." 

The chapter on parataxis likewise merits spe- 
cial attention. The investigator must hence- 
forth reckon with Professor Morris's theses ; 
the student will find the book suggestive and 
stimulating ; but oh, if only some of those 
pedagogues would read it, with whom section- 
numbers in Harkness, or Allen and Green- 
ough, have ceased to be references and have 
become obsessions! 

It is curious to note how the cry of method 
reechoes through these four volumes. But it 
is a cry for correct and fruitful methods, or such 
at least as command consideration. Allin all, 
the volumes fittingly hold a place in the secu- 
lar series in which they are included. They 
appeal to the senate of scholarship and to the 
referendum of thought ; they reflect the spirit 
of both university and the college, of both truth 
and culture. In both senses they are worthy of 
the great Whitney. GuiDO H. Stempel.

ness of the present graded system, he devotes the 
remaining portion of the book to the school of the 
future, its location, its plant, its teachers, its studies, 
and its relations to the community. Among his 
novel suggestions are the following : All the schools 
of a city, from the kindergarten to the high school, 
are to be concentrated in one large park. The 
course of study and organization of the schools are 
to be completely reconstructed. Until the eighth 
year of a child's life, he shall attend only a play 
school or modernized kindergarten ; three years will 
suflBce for an alphabetic school where the " three r's " 
are acquired. For the grammar grades, an inter- 
mediate school would be substituted which would 
aim to develop the vital human interests of the 
children. The book should be read not only for 
its views, which are stimulating, but for the rSsumS 
which it incidentally gives of many of the impor- 
tant educational experiments of the last decade, and 
for the outline of elementary method from the 
subjective or child-study standpoint. The volume 
has, however, many of the defects of a radical 
plea. It is loosely put together, exaggerations 
abound, and it is lacking in judicial quality. Some 
of the references are inexact, and the evidence cited 
to support the alarmist position as to over-pressure 
in the schools is insufficient, while some of the 
authorities are so old as to be practically worthless. 
In a book of its general purpose, these defects may 
be considered of minor significance. In general, 
it deserves the popularity which it has already 
achieved. 

Mr. H. Thiselton Mark, of Owens College, 
Manchester, has collected bis general impressions 
of American schools in a volume entitled " Indi- 
viduality and the Moral Aim in American Educa- 
tion." He examined many phases of education, in 
order to characterize the American spirit; the plans 
of school organization, methods of classification, 
training of teachers, child study, the kindergarten, 
women's clubs, colleges and universities, the educa- 
cational press, — all these pass successively under 
his microscope. The resulting conclusions may be 
recommended as an antidote to the recent utter- 
ances of Professor Miinsterberg. "There is prob- 
ably nothing more beautiful in education anywhere 
than the school-life of the children in the best

own natural life, which it sapplements, enlarges,

The aim of "The Art of Teaching," Dr. Emer- 
eon E. White's concluding contribation to his ped- 
agogical series, is to set before the elementary 
teacher clear-cut standards and tests of efiBciency 
by which she may judge her own work. The first 
section of the volume treats of the fundamental 
aims of good teaching, as exemplified in drills, 
oral instruction, examinations, class or individual 
instruction, etc. The latter half offers suggestions 
in regard to the different subjects of the elemen- 
tary curriculum. On the theoretical side Dr. White 
is conservative, perhaps unduly so in his estimate 
of the services of philosophy and genetic psychology 
to education ; but his treatment of every-day 
schoolroom problems represents a wealth of mature 
judgment which few teachers can afford to dis- 
pense with. 

Prof. S. S. Laurie has issued a new edition of 
his selected papers on " The Training of Teachers 
and Methods of Instruction." Two new articles, 
one on university education and another on history 
and citizenship in the school, are included. The 
essays naturally fall into three groups: (1) those 
dealing with the professional training of teachers ; 
(2) those treating of the functions of different 
grades of schools (primary, secondary, university) ; 
and (3) those handling problems of the curriculum 
and the internal management of schools. These 
articles are thoughtful and well-prepared discus- 
sions of important issues in education, and are 
written in a philosophic spirit. While written to 
meet special occasions in Great Britain, Professor 
Laurie has so well viewed the problems in their 
wider aspects that an American can read them 
with profit. The paper on '• The Religious Exluca- 
tion of the Toung " is one which might well be 
republished in cheap form for popular use. 

Professor Pinloche's long-heralded volume on 
"Pestalozzi and the Foundation of the Modern 
Elementary School," which concludes the •' Great 
Educators " series, is something of a disappoint- 
ment, largely because of its unsympathetic picture 
of Pestalozzi's personality. The larger portion of 
the book is given to a systematic statement of 
Pestalozzi's views on education colled from his own 
writings ; this will be of great service to students, 
as some of the originals are not accessible in En- 
glish translations. This section would have been 
of more value had Professor Pinloche explained 
Pestalozzi and compared his ideas at different 
periods of his career, — Pestalozzi's emotional out- 
bursts being at times unsatisfactory expressions of 
his own views. The concluding chapters on Pesta- 
lozzi's influence are slight and scrappy. The book 
contains signs of having been written in haste. 

In four hundred pages, Professor Kemp hag 
written a new history of education, which covers 
the entire territory from the ancient Egyptians to 
Herbert Spencer. More space is given to accounts 
of the educational systems of modern Europe and 



America than is usual in similar treatises, and less 
attention is paid to the personality of the educa- 
tional reformers. Professor Kemp writes force- 
ful, idiomatic English, devoid of technical express- 
ions ; consequently the book is better suited to the 
needs of immature students than most of its rivals 
for popular favor. At times, the author's popular 
style carries him beyond the pale, as in the case of 
his description of Rosmini as "a brainy, learned, 
and pious Italian priest." A useful list of books 
is appended, which might have been strengthened 
by more descriptive notes, and the initials, at 
least, of the authors. 

A select committee of the New England History 
Teachers' Association, consisting of C. D. Hazen, 
E. G. Bourne, Sarah M. Dean, Max Farrand, and 
A. B. Hart, has enriched the literature of method 
with one of the best pieces of descriptive bibliog- 
raphy yet published, in its report on " Historical 
Sources in Schools." The first part of the report 
consists of a brief and conservative discussion of 
the source method of teaching history. The four 
remaining sections describe the sources, (1) of an- 
cient history, (2) medieval and modern European 
history, (3) English history, and (4) American his- 
tory ; the main divisions thus corresponding to the 
recommendations of the Committee of Seven. The 
list of sources, arranged topically, is not the aso&l 
mere collection of titles, publishers, and prices, bat 
a series of valuable descriptive and critical para- 
graphs which no teacher of history in secondary 
schools can afford to be without.

Although Mr. Walter H. Page has

cess, the most " literary of our 
magazines, we fancy he would hardly like to be 
called a man of letters. To him the world is a 
place in which to do things rather than a place to 
live in and write about, and the literature that tells 
how things are done, or that provides an impetus 
for the doing of others, is the sort of writing that 
most appeals to him. He is an idealist of a very 
practical sort, familiar with many political and 
social problems at first hand, and having a firm 
grasp upon the solid facts of the situations he chooses 
to discuss. These characteristics are very evident 
in the little book which he calls '■ The Rebuilding 
of Old Commonwealths" (Doubleday), and which 
is made up of two addresses and one magazine essay, 
all produced within the last five years. These pa- 
pers deal with the South, for that is the region of 
the author's birth and boyhood; their message is 
that of a man who has not got far enough away from

cratic edifice is the theme of these papers. In the 
first of them, " The Forgotten Man," Mr. Page 
speaks some home truths to the people of North 
Carolina, his own native State. Not in any carping 
spirit, but with stern insistence upon the logic of 
the case, he points out that the State spends $3.40 
per year per pupil for its public schools, and that 
in consequence one white person in every four is 
illiterate, while nearly three hundred thousand North 
Carolinians born have impoverished the common- 
wealth by finding homes in other States. Here is 
" a slight hint of the cost of ignorance and of the 
extravagance of keeping taxes too low." The sub- 
stance of this address is condensed in the admirable 
epigram, " We pay for schools not so much out of 
our purses as out of our state of mind." Mr. Page's 
second paper, " The School that Built a Town," is 
a plea, ringing if not impassioned, for the sacredness 
of the educational calling as the " one true science 
of building a stable and broad-based democratic 
social structure." To his hearers he says, " What- 
ever others may be doing, you are working with the 
central secret of human progress," and the school 
audience which he is addressing is inspired by his 
story of how the public school system of Northwood 
raised the life of the entire community to a higher 
plane. "The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths," 
the third and last of these papers, is a keen diag- 
nosis of the social conditions of the South, which 
shows that slavery is now, as it was fifty years 
ago, mainly responsible for the discouraging facts 
of the situation, and again pointing to public 
education as the sole efficient agency for the estab- 
lishment of a truly democratic social order. This 
paper, like the other two, is stimulating and sug- 
gestive in the highest degree, and deserves to find 
the widest possible audience of readers. 

'***"'?' The preparation of a school text- 

0} English book of the history of English liter- 

tuerature. ature presents a task of constantly 

increasing difficulty. The number of good texts is 
already considerable, and there is not much latitude 
possible as to the selection or omission of facts. 
Nor is there much more in the matter of critical 
estimates ; for authoritative opinion concerning the 
chief English authors is fairly well crystallized, and 
a new writer has no right to be original. Beyond 
an occasional variation of the accent, or shading 
of the emphasis, he cannot go if he is to be a safe 
guide for young students. He may express his 
own opinion concerning the relative supremacy 
of Shelley and Wordsworth, or of Tennyson and 
Browning ; he may construct his own hierarchy of 
the Elizabethan dramatists ; he may correct erro- 
neous popular judgments. But he is under bonds 
not to be biassed or sensational or erratic in the 
views which he promulgates. The latest " History 
of English Literature" (Seribner) is the work of 
Professors William Vaughn Moody and Robert 
Morss Lovett, and its controlling principle is stated 



in the following words : " The fact has been held 
constantly in mind that literature, being the vital 
and fluid thing it is, must be taught, if at all, more 
by suggestion, and by stimulation of the student's 
own instinctive mental life, than by dogmatic 
assertion. More than any other branch of study, 
literature demands on the part of the teacher an 
attitude of respect toward the intelligence of the 
student ; and if at any point the authors of this book 
may seem to have taken too much alertness of mind 
for granted, their defence must be that only by 
challenge and invitation can any permanent result 
in the way of intellectual growth be accomplished." 
This is the apology of the authors, if any apology is 
needed, for having written their book, not in the 
dry fashion of the ordinary school-text, but with the 
literary grace and delicacy of phrase that we look 
for in the critical essayist who addresses an adult 
audience. They have produced the best-written 
elementary text-book of the subject that we have 
ever read ; whether it will prove proportionally ex- 
cellent as a teaching manual is a matter of some 
doubt. It is a book that can be read straight through 
with pleasure ; whether it is a book that can be prof- 
itably studied, paragraph by paragraph, by crude 
young minds of slight literary range, is quite 
another matter. What we have said may be illus- 
trated by a few sentences from the characterization 
of Hamlet. " The core of his purpose is always 
firm ; and it is one of the ironies of circumstance that 
Hamlet has come to stand in most minds for a type 
of irresolution. This misunderstanding of the char- 
acter is largely due to the exaltation of excitement 
in Hamlet, which causes his mind, even in the mo- 
ment when he is pursuing his purpose with most 
intentness, to play with feverish brilliancy over the 
questions of man's life and death ; which makes his 
throbbing white-hot imagination a meeting-place for 
grotesque and extravagant fancies ; and which leads 
him, so to speak, to cover the solid framework of 
his enterprise with a wild festoonery of intellectual 
whim, to envelop it in fitful eloquence, swift and 
subtle wit, contemptuous irony and mordant sat- 
ire." Fine as this unquestionably is in thought 
and expression, it must remain meaningless ver- 
biage to nine-tenths of the young readers for whom 
it is intended. But even if this book should prove 
ill-adapted to its immediate purpose, there is matter 
for congratulation in its having been produced. It 
stands in refreshing contrast to the formal text- 
books, and is the book that we should next recom- 
mend to students and readers who have graduated 
from their Stopford Brooke's " Primer." It is well 
proportioned, giving much space to the last two 
centuries, yet not filling that space with superfluous 
names, titles, and dates. The writers have felt that 
an author worth mentioning at all was worth dis- 
cussing with some seriousness, and this has been 
their method throughout. The " Reading Guide " 
at the end occupies twenty-five pages, and is of 
great value. We have noticed a few slips, but they

are hardly worth mentioning. They inclade saeh 
things, for example, as the misquotation " broad- 
ening down from precedent to precedent." and the 
statement that '■ The Cloister and the Hearth " is 
a story " of the life of Erasmus," instead of dealing 
with the parents of Erasmus. 

So completely has wood-engraving 
been superseded by the modern 
"process" methods of picture re- 
prodaetion that we of to-day are apt to forget or 
overlook the large part played by the graver's tool 
in tbe history of popular art. Up to little more 
than a generation ago. engraving on wood was 
practically the only method of reproducing an 
artist's drawing for the purpose* of the printing 
press ; wood-engraving was then a flourishing pro- 
fession, and the engraver was a mighty personage 
upon whose skill the artist must depend entirely 
for the impression of his work received by the 
general public. An interesting realization of this 
vanished condition may be gained from the volume 
entitled '> The Brothers Dalziel" (Dntton). a record, 
autobiographic in form, of the work of George and 
Edward Dalziel, two noted English wood-engravers. 
For half a century (1840-1890) these brothers, 
perhaps the leaders of their profession in England, 
worked in close association with many of the fore- 
most artists of the period, not only in the repro- 
dnction of their drawings on tbe block, but also in 
the superintendence and publication of elaborate 
ar^books, such as •■ Dalziel's Arabian Nights " and 
" Dalziel's Bible Gallery." The last-named collec- 
tion includes some of the most notable work of what 
has been called the golden age of English illustra- 
tion. To its preparation the Dalziels devoted years 
of ptatient labor and many thousands of dollars, en- 
listing the services of such artists as Lord Leighton, 
Borne Jones. Holman Hunt. Ford Madox Brown, 
and Mr. G. F. Watts. Yet the enterprise was 
financially almost a complete failure, some two 
hundred copies being the extent of the sales. 
Messrs. Dalziel's informal account of their half- 
century of work is liberally sprinkled with appre- 
ciative letters (many reproduced in facsimile) from 
the artists whose blocks passed through their hands. 
There is one from Rossetti, in which he speaks of 
two engravings (evidently those for the " Moxon " 
Tennyson) as •• now highly satisfactory and well 
repaying all your pains." It will be recalled that 
Rossetti's first experience with the Dalziels, in con- 
nection with the drawing for AUingbam's •' The Maid 
of Elfin-Mere," was one of sore trial for both artist 
and engraver, and the inspiration for such pleas- 
antries as the following : 

" O woodman spare that block, 
O K»A Bot aa jhow ! 
It took ten days hy clock. 
I'd fain protect it now. 
dons— Wild Unslit«r from Dalziel's workakop." 
Bat, with due allowance for Rossetti's humorous 
exaggeration, it must be said that his tribulations 
were owing rather to his own ignorance of tbe tech- 



nical requirements in the case than to any fault of 
the engravers. That the relations of the Brother- 
hood with their many exacting clients were gener- 
ally of the most genial and satisfactory sort there 
is ample testimony in these pages. Of the thon- 
cands of blocks sent oat from their workshop, the 
Messrs. Dalziel have selected the most noteworthy 
for reproduction in the present volume. There are 
upwards of 150 plates in all, including specimens 
of the work of nearly every prominent English 
artist of the earlier Victorian period who haa 
worked in black-and-white. The collection thus 
brought together is a remarkable one, which the 
art-lover should not overlook. We trust the kindly 
memory of the Brothers Dalziel and their distin- 
guished work may be kept alive for many a day by 
this handsome volume. 



The publication of Mr. John Cor- 
m OmfJ^' bin's " An American at Oxford " 

(Hoaghton) has an unanticipated 
timeliness, coming, as it does, just after the an- 
nouncement of the Rhodes bequest. Every yoang 
man in America who is ambitious to become a 
Rhodes scholar at Oxford will be certain to want 
this book, to say nothing of the many others who 
will be attracted to it as an interesting contribu- 
tion to educational literature. What Mr. Corbin 
does is to give us, in simple and sometimes too 
colloquial language, an account of the Oxford stu- 
dent's life, in and out of doors, from the time of 
his matriculation to the time when he leaves the 
venerable city of the Isis armed with his pass or 
honors degree, as the ca«e may be. We know of 
no other book that gives precisely this information, 
which is frequently of a nature to impress very 
earionsly the youth whose ideas of university life 
are derived from experience of American or Ger- 
man institutions. We are told about the provisions 
for the comfort of students, their breakfasts from 
the college kitchen, their dinners in halL, their clois- 
tered conditions of life, and their athletic sports. 
Emphasis is properly placed upon the social aspects 
of life at Oxford, for in these aspects may be found 
the most distinctive difference between the English 
universities and those of other countries. We regret 
to notice that Mr. Corbin thinks that the Rhodes 
trustees ''should be most vigorously urged to select 
the scholars from the graduates of American uni- 
versities." That the founder of the scholarships 
had DO such idea in his mind is perfectly evident 
from the terms of his will, and this suggestion is 
tantamount to a plea for bad faith on the part of 
the executors. 

Mr. Sherwin Cody is one of a nnm- 
neauea/tie ]^j. ^f writers who have recently 

Oman oXmy. _ . ^ 

been trying to make out a case for 
the artistic differentiation of the short story from 
tbe more extended work of fiction. They claim 
that the short story is not a novel in miniature, but 
a distinct literary form, with its own laws and mode 
of development. The argument is ingenious, but 



98 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



it has always seemed to as a little sophistical, and 
the question is at least still open for debate. Mr. 
Cody has lately illustrated his thesis by collecting 
a dozen or more of typical examples, and publishing 
them in a volume with general and special intro- 
ductions. This volume is entitled " Selections from 
the World's Greatest Short Stories " (McClurg), 
and, whatever we may think of the editor's thesis, 
the volume is a good one to read and to possess. 
As to the selection made, there are many possible 
opinions. Six of the stories are " Patient Griselda," 
" Aladdin," Balzac's " A Passion in the Desert," 
Irving's "Rip Van Winkle," Poe's "The Gold- 
Bug," and Hawthorne's " The Great Stone Face." 
There can hardly be any question about the claim 
of these six to be included in any representative 
collection, and the same may perhaps be said of the 
" Christmas Carol " of Charles Dickens. But we 
have grave doubts concerning " A Princess's 
Tragedy," from Thackeray's " Barry Lyndon," as 
also concerning the selections made from Maupassant 
and Mr. Kipling. As for the incongruity of putting 
things by Mr. J. M. Barrie and Mr. Arthur Mor- 
rison in such a collection, there can be no doubt at 
all. And where is Tourgu^nie£P, the greatest of all 
masters of this form of literature? 



The labor involved in the prepara- 
A nti^treatue jj^^ „{ ^ modern manual of Zoology 
on Zoology. . .. j ^. - -ii 

IS 80 great and the expense of illus- 
tration so considerable that there is a growing ten- 
dency to make such treatises somewhat of an inter- 
national undertaking. An illustration of this effort 
to obliterate national limitations is to be found in 
Messrs. Shipley and McBride's " Zoology " (Mac- 
millan), which has been written with both the 
English and the American constituency in view. 
The English training of both authors gives, how- 
ever, somewhat of a British bias to the terminology, 
and the sources of illustration are less American 
than students in this country might wish. This 
affects the work in question merely in the matter of 
convenience to users of the book upon this side of 
the Atlantic. Science cares little for political 
boundaries, and good books from any land are wel- 
comed in all. It has been the aim of the authors 
to prepare an elementary treatise in which the sub- 
ject should be developed as the reader advances. 
To this end the earlier chapters deal with the fun- 
damentals of the science in an elementary way, 
while the later ones are more advanced both in 
method and matter. The authors have taken great 
liberties in the arrangement of the systematic por- 
tion of the text, to the consternation of those who 
rejoice in uniformity of classification and arrange- 
ment. Many new figures, either from original 
drawings or original sources, appear in this text for 
the first time. The compass of the book, and the 
skill with which the authors have chosen the matter 
from the great array of results of the investigations 
of recent years, render their manual one of our best 
short treatises on zoology. 



The forest, as a living perpetual re-

ning to claim its own with the 
American people. Time was when we looked to it 
merely for lumber, or sought only to rid the land 
of its presence ; but now its relation to water sup- 
ply, and thus to irrigation and navigation, is added 
to the prospect of a lumber famine. Growth of 
interest in silviculture is also evidenced by the 
establishment of courses of instruction in our uni- 
versities, and the increase in our national forest re- 
serves. The claims of recreation and sport are 
likewise potent, since they enlist aesthetic interests 
in the cause of forestry. All these considerations 
tend to make Professor John Gifford's book on 
" Practical Forestry " (Appleton) both timely and 
attractive. It is a popular presentation of the re- 
lation of trees to the manifold phases of our civil- 
ization, and to the phenomena and forces of nature, 
to soil, flood, and wind ; to the landscape and to 
health. The agencies operative in the extension 
and limitation of forests, and methods for their 
formation and improvement, are discussed, and the 
industries which have been built upon their products 
are described. Brief reference is made to tropical 
forests, and the public reservations in this country 
are enumerated. The scope of the work, the sug- 
gestions for economic utilization of the forest, the 
condemnation of wholesale destruction and of fire 
waste, combine to make the book a force in the 
education of the reading public to the importance of 
prompt action in all public questions affecting our 
woodlands. Owners of country homes, and all 
lovers of nature, will find in it many suggestions 
of value. 



An attractive 
Psychology. 



Text-books in Psychology, though 
by no means the barren and dull con- 
tributions that they are supposed to 
be, are yet rarely of the type to make attractive 
general reading, — that of Professor James being 
always the notable exception. What may be de- 
manded of a text is that it shall prove both helpful 
and attractive to the student who approaches the 
subject-matter with a student's interest and attitude. 
The recent text by Dr. Lightner Witmer of the 
University of Pennsylvania (Ginn & Co.) complies 
with these requirements to more than the usual ex- 
tent. The specific traits of the book are the selec- 
tions of its illustrative material, whereby charts and 
diagrams and illustrations enable the student to 
prove for himself many of the essential principles, 
and so in a modest measure furnish him with a 
miniature psychological outfit of an experimental 
kind ; and again the selection and treatment of 
portions of the field best suited to the illustration 
of the facts and principles of mental analysis. Such 
a selection necessarily omits a great deal that a 
student might care to know ; but by confining the 
attention to those portions that are really pedagog- 
ically suitable, the text gains in intent where it 
loses in extent. Dr. Witmer has produced a volume

enough; we do not go to Max O'Rell for nicety of 
phrasing. What we do go for, we get in the new 
book, which, while it is never profoand. and is 
often trite, contains plenty of amusing aneedotes 
with much witty criticism and interesting general- 
ization. From the view-point of his cosmopolitan 
career, the author compares national characteristics, 
noting such matters as the philosophic cheerfulness 
of the French, the astounding length of the Amer- 
ican memory, or the unfortunate assumption of the 
Englishman that he may be as disagreeable as he 
pleases when he travels. The author dispenses good 
advice in epigram to all the world and his wife, 
present an4 prospective, and analyses and classifies 
•'■ Her Royal Highness Woman " as she appears in 
her endless variety to her subject man. His work 
strikes the popular note indicative of the lecturer 
and journalist ; and in spite of the fact that there 
is almost too much of it, is clever and timely 
enough to find many readers. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" A Complete Geography," by Professors Ralph S. 
Tarr and Frank M. McMnrrv, is the second volume 
of the " two book series " of these saccessf nl text- 
makers, and is indeed a complete treatment of the 
subject for all ordinarv school purposes. The maps 
alone namber over a hundred, and the other illostra- 
tions, mostly photographic, are too numerous to count. 
The work is thoronghly modem and scientific in its 
treatment of the subject, and, best of all, is not an 
ungainly quarto, but a volame of reasonable dimen- 
sions, with a page not much larger than that of other 
school books. The Macmillan Co. are the publishers. 

In modern language texts, the American Book Co.

We note with pleasure the signs of prosperity and 
progress in our old friend under a new name, " Out

in this case the wisdom of the step seeaw vindicated, 
and the new magazine has an air of maturity and ful- 
ness corresponding with its broadened field and title. 
The August number gives the third section of Mr. 
Lommis's remarkable series of papers, descriptive and

breezy and enlivening personality. 

The " History of the Roman People," which Dr. 
William Fairley has translated (and to a certain ex- 
tent edited) from the French of Professor Charles 
Seignobos, represents the best form of scholarly French 
text-buok, and is now offered for use in American 
schools and colleges. The author writes with graphic 
power, literary charm, and philosophical purpose, which 
qualities are mostly retained in this adaptation of his 
work. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers. 

In a review of Mr. Bryce's " Studies in History and 
Jurisprudence," in The Dial for July 16, in discussing 
the chapter on the old constitution of Iceland it was 
incidentally remarked that " Mr. Bryce probably never 
visited the historic isle," etc. This surmise is evidently 
an error; for a correspondent calls our attention to a 
passage from the author's earlier work, " The American 
Commonwealth," in which he says: " Sixteen years ago 
I travelled in Iceland with two friends " (introductory 
chapter, p. 9 of ed. of 1888). 

A revised edition of Mr. G. A. Wentworth's "Col- 
lege Algebra" is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
The same publishers also send us a revised edition 
of Dr. Alfred P. Gage's " Introduction to Physical 
Science," and a new " Manual of Astronomy " by Pro- 
fessor Charles A. Young. The latter work occupies an 
intermediate position between the author's two earlier 
texts, which have been drawn upon freely in its prepar- 
ation. It is a leather-bound volume of over six hun- 
dred pages, with many illustrations. 

A fifth volume of "Old South Leaflets" brings 
together a new collection of twenty-five of these valu- 
able reprints of source material, and will be welcomed 
by every teacher of American history. The contents 
are too varied for any general description, but we may 
note the group of eight that deal with the early 
exploration and colonization of the new world. The 
remaining pamphlets deal with subjects as far apart as 
More's " Utopia," Dante's " De Monarchia," Bede on 
Augustine, Horace Mann on free schools, Grotius on 
" War and Peace," and the Hague Conference.

106 THE DIAL [Sept.1. 



ADVANCE NOTES— A. C. McCLURG & CO. 

F'OR the information of the readers of The Dial, we take pleasure in giving 
some advance data about our Fall books of 1902, which we believe will 
be of interest. Our list will include seventeen titles, and in matter and 
make-up it will be the most generally attractive we have ever put out. 

Our most noteworthy undertaking is the new popular edition of "The Ex- 
pedition of Lewis and Clark." In two square octavo volumes of over 500 
pages each, printed from new type of a large clear face, on fine laid paper, 
with new photogravure portraits and fac-simile maps, and with an introduction 
by Dr. James K. Hosmer and a copious index, this will undoubtedly take its 
place as the standard popular edition of Lewis and Clark. (In box, S5.00 net.) 

Probably the most beautifully embellished book we have ever issued will 
be "The Birds of the Rockies." The text is by Leander S. Keyser, the well- 
known author of "In Bird Land," and the pictorial features include eight full- 
page plates, four of which are in color, by the eminent nature painter, Louis 
Agassiz Fuertes, thirty-three charming text illustrations by Bruce Horsfall, 
and eight full-page scenic plates from photographs. The binding and printing 
of the book are strikingly attractive. (In box, S3.00 net.) 

In response to repeated requests, we have prepared for the Holidays 
an illustrated edition of Max Miiller's "Memories" — a classic which has 
now reached a sale with us of nearly 40,000 copies. The book will be a hand- 
some square octavo, and is printed from entirely new plates, with eight beauti- 
ful charcoal drawings and other pictorial embellishments by Blanche Ostertag. 
The cover, also designed by Miss Ostertag, is unique. (In box, S2.00 net.) 

Our fiction will include a volume of clever stories of Chicago business life 
by Will Payne, called "On Fortune's Road," with illustrations by Thomas 
Fogarty (gi.50); a spirited and exciting historical novel, "The Holland 
Wolves," illustrated in a highly dramatic manner by the Kinneys (illustrators 
of "The Thrall of Leif the Lucky") (Si. 50); an illustrated edition of the 
popular romance of Indian Oregon, "The Bridge of the Gods," with eight 
strong pictures by the well-known western artist, L. Maynard Dixon ($1.50), 
and "A Captive of the Roman Eagles," a historical romance by Felix Dahn, 
translated from the German by Mary J. Safford ($1.50). 

A unique volume in typography, binding, and illustrations is "In Argolis," 
by Mr. George Horton, a delightful personal account of family life in Greece 
(Si. 75 net). Another admirable gift book, especially for music lovers, is Mr. 
George P. Upton's "Musical Pastels," a series of essays on quaint and cur- 
ious musical subjects, illustrated from rare wood engravings (In box, S2.00 net). 

Mr. Upton has also added to his well-known series of musical handbooks 
a new volume on "The Standard Light Operas," which will be widely 
popular (Si. 20 net). Mr. William Morton Payne has followed his "Little 
Leaders" and "Editorial Echoes" with "Various Views" (Si.oo net), and 
the popular "Helpful Thoughts Series" will have a new volume, "Catch 
Words of Cheer," by Sara A. Hubbard (80 cts. net). 

In regard to our Juveniles we have no hesitation in saying that the public 
has seldom been offered so attractive a line in matter and make-up. A notable 
feature of several volumes will be illustrations in color, and the cover designs 
are novel, artistic, and striking. The titles include a most engaging book of 
nonsense by Carolyn Wells, "The Pete and Polly Stories," with irresistible 
pictures by Fanny Young Cory (Si. 50 net); "Little Mistress Good Hope," 
a volume of fairy stories by Mary Imlay Taylor, with notable colored draw- 
ings by Jessie Willcox Smith (Si. 50 net); "Mayken," a historical story of 
Holland, illustrated by the Kinneys (Si. 20 net); two volumes of delightful 
fairy stories with charming illustrations in color by Lucy Fitch Perkins; 
"Coquo and the King's Children," by Cornelia Baker (Si. 50 net), and 
"Prince Silver Wings," by Edith Ogden Harrison (S1.75 net). Mrs. Harri- 
son is the wife of Mayor Carter H. Harrison of Chicago, and in this volume 
she makes a graceful literary debut.

YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 
n. 



CoDtinaing from a previoos number oar 
summary of the " Athenaeum '" annual reports 
of the Continental literatures, we now present 
the following abstracts : Grreeoe, by Professor 
S. P. Lambros ; Holland, by Mr. H. S. M. van 
Wickevoort Crommelin : Hungary, by Mr. 
Leopold Katscher ; Italy, by Dr. Gnido Biagi ; 
Poland, by Dr. Adam Belcikowski ; Rassia, 
by Mr. Valerii Briasov ; and Spain, by Don 
Kafael Altamira. 

One would expect from Athens some acooant 
of the riotous proceedings evoked last autumn 
by the vernacular translation of the New Testa- 
ment, but Professor Lambros makes only a 
passing allusion to the matter. 

" The attempt to introduce into historical description 
popular idiom only tolerated in poetry is not in aceord- 
aaee with the desire of the nation; on ethnic grounds 
the Greeks wish to be purists. So the experiment of 
translating the Gospel into popular dialect by Mr. Alex- 
ander Pallis was regarded as anti-national and anti- 
religioos, and led last November to a rising of the 
•tndenta and people of Athens which ended in &tal 
■eenes and the resignation of the Government." 

The chief literary happening of the year in 
Greece has been the Centennial festival of the 
patriotic poet Solomos, whose poems have ap- 
peared in a new critical edition, and whose 
statue was unveiled in Zante last June. In 
belles-lettres, 

" Mr. Panajotis Zanos has published three plays, ' Di- 
ogenes Romaros,' ■ .Andromeda and Perseus,' ■ Com- 
nenus and Theodora.' The last deals with the taking 
of Thessalonica by the Turks in 1430. Mr. NichoU^ 
Lascaris has produced various one-act comedies. Mr. A. 
Nicolaras has written a beautiful play on Ariadne. The 
best publication of the dramatic year is the 'Aristo- 
demos ' of Mr. K. Angelopnjos. Full of feeling are the 
first attempts in poetry of a young lady, Miss Aemilia 
Kurtelis, entitled ' Chrysanthema.' A pseudonymous 
writer, Vangos, has mystified people by an old Roman 
manuscript of folk-poetry. The name of the new 
Macpherson cannot be revealed at present. The poem 
itself is not without merit, but has nothing of Ossian's 
swing about it." 

Historical and philological works are as nu- 
merous as ever, but not very interesting save 
to the specialist. 

Heer Crommelin, writing of things Dutch, 



110 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



says that "the book which must puzzle the 
critic of Holland most this year is, undoubtedly, 
Heer Jan Apol's ' Phaethon and the Fool.' It 
is no more than a common tale of youthful ex- 
periences and feelings, but told in a sort of 
poetic ecstasy." The works of Heer Cyriel 
Buysse ("Van Arme Menschen"), of Heer 
van Hulzen (" Zwervers "), of Heer Brandt 
van Doorne ("Verweghe en Zijn Vrouw"), 
of Heer van Eckeren (" Donkere Machten "), 
and of Heer Louis Couperus, are characterized 
by " a healthy endeavor to put away all undue 
elaboration and to strive only for a pure ex- 
pression of thoughts and feelings worth utter- 
ing." Heer Couperus has produced this year 
not less than three volumes, two of which belong 
to a sort of tetralogy, " De Boeken der Kleine 
Zielen "; while the third, called " Babel," dis- 
cusses " the extreme pains our times takes to 
produce monstrous superfluities." 

"The theme is a huge scheme for rebuilding the 
Tower of Babel. It is resolved that this time the tower 
shall reach the throne of Baal. Thus it becomes a work 
of years and years, which costs the Utcs and happiness 
of thousands. But the self-seeking pride of the master- 
builders, who suffer others to do the hard work, is kept 
back neither by floods or the fire of heaven, wbich 
threaten to destroy the building, nor by any reasons of 
sentiment. The impossibility of reaching heaven by a 
tower built on the blood of slaves is at length acknowl- 
edged by Cyrus, a shepherd's son of royal descent who 
had joined the builders. He leaves them when it dawns 
on him that their labour leads to no other goal than the 
unreasonable glorification of a few; and when he com- 
municates this discovery to the enslaved multitude, a 
flower, the flower of mercy, springs up from the hard 
granite of the tower, a miracle which surpasses the 
dazzling enterprise of man." 

Other works of Active art are : " Na Scheiding 
en Dood," by Mrs. Atink ; " Doodendans," by 
Heer Stijn Streuvels ; and " De Jonge Do- 
minee," by Heer J. Eigenhuis. The " Hol- 
landsche Belletrie " of Dr. C. van Deventers 
is a critical work dealing with the writers of 
the present day. The author 
" Is especially attracted by the psychological element in 
literature, and is ready to forgive many faults as to 
form and plan, and even as to the exposition of char- 
acter, if only the author is thoroughly in earnest, and 
the spirit of his work is sympathetic." 

In poetry, after some years of considerable 
dearth, new life is evident. There is Dr. van 
Eeden's " Passielooze Lilie," poems notable for 
their sweetness and thoughtfulness. 

" Less popular, though not less in craf tmanship, is 
Dr. J. B. Schepers's ' Bragi,' which has been very well 
received. . . . An interesting event of the year has 
been the appearance of political songs of the time by 
the young Heer C. S. Adama van Scheltema, a socialist, 
grandson of a well-known public man." 



On the stage, the most conspicuous figure is 
that of Heer Herman Heyermans. 

" His works are so well written that in reading them 
one has no difficulty in forgetting their doubtful dra- 
matic merit. His latest work, ' Ora et Labora,' is little 
more than a melodrama (which probably accounts for 
its success on the stage), but the dialogue is very clever. 
Heer Heyermans meets life with a laugh and a sneer, 
but he renders it with a sigh and a tear, to please the 
pit." 

Fiction in Hungary, writes Mr. Leopold 
Katscher, " has been at an extraordinarily low 
ebb during the past twelve months — so much 
so that only two novels and three volumes of 
short stories deserve mention." The novels 
are " Heathens," by Mr. Ferencz Herczeg, and 
" The Tartod Bear-Hunting," by Mr. Dezso 
Malonyay. The former of these novels is a 
vigorous historical romance of the eleventh 
century ; the latter is Transylvanian and mod- 
ern. The three volumes of stories are "Insig- 
nificant Tales," by Mr. Bela Szivus, who has 
been styled the Hungarian Gorky ; " Wan- 
derers," by Mr. Ede Kabos ; and " Living 
Pictures," by Mr. Istvan Barsony. 

"The best volume of poetry this year is Mr. Lajos 
Bart6k's ' Hope and Remembrance,' which is calculated 
to increase his deserved popularity. It contains verse 
of fiery imagination, rare beauty of form, and patriotic 
elevation." 

On the stage " no play of literary value has 
had a lasting success ; still, several really good 
dramas and tragedies have been produced." 
Mr. Jeno Rakosi is the author of " Queen 
Tagma," a " half-historical, half-legendary and 
fanciful tragedy, strangly influenced by Shake- 
speare and the Greek classics ; a romantic and 
powerful piece of work." Mr. Lajos Palagyi's 
"The Slaves" is a Roman verse-drama of the 
times of Nero. Mrs. Gyorgy Vero's " Cain " 
is distinguished from other treatments of the 
subject by its substitution for envy of ill-fated 
love for a woman as Cain's motive for slaying 
Abel — the love of both brothers for one sis- 
ter. Among works of serious scholarship, the 
following are important : " The Memorial of 
King Matthias Corvinus," by many hands, 
edited by Professor Marki ; "Labour," by 
Mr. Jenb Kunz ; " Essays on Political Econ- 
omy," by Professor Bela Foldes ; " The Pro- 
tection of Marriage in Criminal Law," by Mr. 
Rustem Vanbery ; and the " Dictionary of the 
Revival of the Magyar Language," by Mr. 
Kalman Sziby. 

Dr. Guido Biagi is pessimistic on the sub- 
ject of the intellectual life of Italy at the 
present time. 



1902.] 



THE DIAL, 



111 



" We hare ezperieneed a period of lassitode, of lan- 
guor, that shows do sign of passing awaj. . . . We are 
witnessing a fatal decadence in Tarious branches of lit- 
erature, and the public is getting rapidlr disgusted by 
a sense of satietT and nausea. Lectures or conferences, 
for instaoce, bare become a veritable nuisance, a pub- 
lic calamitT. No one any longer desires to listen to 
them, whether he be invited or (as Leopardi proposed) 
paid something to lend his ears and patience." 

The decadence of the theatre is anivereally 
lamented. 

" Now the theatres are full of translations from the 
French of comedies the subjects of which are generally 
lewd, with improbable plots, in which are jumbled 
incidents of dubious humour and scenes grotesquely 
salacious. Passiou is not the subject of these prodnc- 
tions, but rather sensual caprice." 

The one production of the year that helps to 
redeem this deplorable situation is, of course, 
the " Francesca da Rimini ' of Signor d'An- 
nunzio. In this work of genius, the author 
" Wished to prove that a work of art, as regards the 
public, the subject, and poetry itself, should be repre- 
sented with the aid of whatever may serve to make its 
value and purpose best understood. What is done 
elsewhere when the plays of Shakespeare are acted, 
what is done in France by grandiose neurotic repre- 
sentation, might at least be attempted for an Italian 
drama. And the poet, with the taste of an artist and 
the patience of a scholar, determined to search out and 
study every minute detail of costume, furniture, and 
scenery, in order to supply correspondinglv faithful 
pictures of the troublous life which he evoked bv the 
breath of his poetry. . . . The audience felt that they 
were in the presence of a work of art ; they breathed 
as it were that air of bygone times, so full of perfumed 
breezes, where the warm blood spirting forth waters 
the beds of flowers, where the sweet scents of poetry 
mingle with the acrid odours of battle. The faithful 
and vigorous reproduction of those scenes of medieval 
life struck by its boldness the mind of the ordinary pub- 
lie, and was very favourably received by graver critics." 

There have been published during the year 
"two collections of poems of the highest 
value."' One of them is the single- volume 
abridgment of the complete works of Signor 
Carducci. the other is a similar abridgment of 
the poems of his alumnus, Signor Giovanni 
Marradi. Of this poet, 

" A Livomese, his master had already written that be 
had ' the gift of full-throated song, the inspiration of 
melody,' and it was great praise; but be has, especially 
by his ' Rapsodia Garibaldina,' shown that he is able to 
sing, and sing well, of 'the profound intuitions of life 
and of history.' Marradi is now recognized as a poet 
of every-day life, as he is acknowledged on all hands 
to be a marvellous artificer of verse, a vigorous word- 
Pointer. To read his songs is to enjoy sweet and 
strong music, to hear once more all the beauties of 
classic art express our deepest feelings, the Olympic 
illusions which atone for what he calls ' the pallid mel- 
ancholy of the world.' So long as Italy has such ar- 
tists, we need not despair of her future." 

In the field of romance a few works are men- 



tioned, none of which are of much importance. 
The titles include " Lett«re d'Amore," by Sig- 
nora Serao ; " Servetta," by Signora " Regina

" Signor Francesco d'Ovidio, one of the masters of 
criticism, has published his ' Stndj snlla Divina Corn- 
media,' which constitute one of the most valaable con- 
tribiftions to modem Dante literature. This book of 
d'Ovidio's has been widely studied and discussed by 
the most competent authorities, and is recognized gen- 
erally here as a work of the first importance." 

History is represented by " Episodi del Risor- 
zimento Italiano," by General Giacomo Du- 
rando : " Scrilti Politici e I'Epistolario di 
Carlo Cattaneo," edited by Mrs. Jessie White 
Mario ; " Epistolario Inediti di G. Mazzini," 
and Signor Guglielmo Ferrero's " Grandezza 
e Decadenza di Roma." A travel book of real 
importance, the Duke of the Abmzzi's " Viag- 
gio al Polo Nord," will be published nert 
October. The Hugo centenary was celebrated 
in Italy, as well as the eightieth birthday of the 
Marchesa del Grillo, better known to the public 
as Adelaide Ristori. And the recent unveiling, 
in Florence, of a monument to Rossini, is said 
to mark " the first time that the Pantheon of 
Italian glory has opened to a musician." 

Dr. Adam Belcikowski tells us that "The 
Affaire Dolenga," by Mr. J. Weyssenhoff, has 
been the greatest success of the year in Polish 
fiction. " A highminded and talented young 
engineer wins the love of the somewhat eccen- 
tric daughter of a prince, but conventional 
prejudices prove too strong, and her happiness 
is sacrificed to them." A novel called " Miss 
Mary," the work of Mr. K. Przerwa-Tetmajer, 
" Is hardly a snoceasfnl eompoand of imagination and 
realism. A millionaire's daughter, of Jewish descent, 
has fallen in love with a musician, but on the failure of 
his opera she refuses to be his wife and marries m 
mined count instead. Uer passion is roused once more 
when the composer, who has meanwliflepaaaed through 
the torments of hell, at laat makes lii»»— if renowned 
on both sides of the globe; bat now be, in his tntn, 
seomfnlly rejects her love." 

Other works of fiction are "Fame" and "Fiat 
Lux," both by Mr. A. Krechowiecki ; " Mr. 
Philip of Konopie," by Mr. K. Glinski ; 
" Nigh to Heaven," a novel of student life by 
Mr. E. Paszkowski ; " The Grey Yam," by 
Mr. J. Swierk ; " The Art Worshippers," 
by Mr. K. Rojon ; and " From Bygone Years," 
by Mr. G. Danilowski. Lyric poetry is rep- 
resented chiefly by three works, Mr. J. Kas-

cycle, " the subject of which is the tragic 
conflict of a soul full of doubt and despair, yet 
at the same time deeply religious and longing 
ardently for faith "; Mr. L. Rydel's » Poems," 
which " make a very different and most har- 
monious impression "; and Mr. L. Staff's "Mas- 
ter Twardowski," dealing " with a legendary 
wizard of the sixteenth century who has much 
in common with the German Faust." A num- 
ber of plays are mentioned, including one by 
the writer of the present article ; and the re- 
port closes with a few words about Professor 
A. Briickner's new history of Polish litera- 
ture, written in the German language. 

" In Russian society and Russian literature," 
writes Mr. Briusov, 

" There has been observed for some time a mystic aud 
religious movement. During the last year it exhibited 
itself with special force. A new society has been 
formed in Petersburg for religious and philosophic 
meetings. ... At the assemblies papers are read on 
religious and ecclesiastical questions, judgment is passed 
upon them, and opinions are uttered with a freedom 
rare in Russia. Ecclesiastics take part with laymen, 
who are chiefly authors. Vestments alternate with 
overcoats, and many ladies come. For the first time, 
after a rupture of two centuries, the literature of the 
layman has stretched out a hand to spiritual thought. 
For the first time problems have made their appear- 
ance, and questions have been discussed equally impor- 
tant to both." 

In connection with these assemblies, and in a 
way marked by their influence, several publi- 
cations are mentioned, among them Professor 
Merezhkovski's " Christ and Antichrist in 
Russian Literature," Mr. N. Minski's "Philo- 
sophic Dialogues," Mr. Boborgkin's novel 
" The Confessors," and a collection of stories 
by Mrs Zenaida Gippius. 

'< Mr. Leonid Andreev has had the gpreatest success 
in belles-lettres, strictly so-called. His first volume of 
tales was sold off in a few weeks. He has remained in 
the fundamental form of his productions true to tradi- 
tion — ' t. e., he is completely accessible to the ordinary 
reader, but at the same time, in some of his methods 
and moods, he is near to the 'new poetry.' He pos- 
sesses the talents of a raconteur, and may be expected 
in the future to find out an independent path." 

With the success of this book can alone be 
compared that of the books of " Maxim Gorky," 
which are now sold by tens of thousands. 

"He has published the fifth volume of his works, 
and in this have appeared the conclusion of his novel 
• The Trio ' and his drama ' The Bourgeeis,' which was 
played at Petersburg with great success. In this play 
a bourgeois family in easy circumstances is living in a 
little town. The children have been educated — the 
son is a student, the daughter a teacher; and misunder- 
standings arise between the parents and the children." 

The first place in Russian poetry must be 



given to " Songs from the Nook," by Mr. K. 
Sluchevski. 

" He is one of the most remarkable Russian poets. 
He has now been writing for almost half a century, but 
till lately he had not secured the fame he deserves. 
The great public knows Sluchevski by name only, but 
he is surrounded with the affectionate regard of his 
friends and all poets. If in Russia a plebiscite were 
taken among poets, as it is in France, Sluchevski would 
certainly receive the greatest number of votes. ' The 
Nook ' is the name of the poet's estate, where he spends 
his summer holidays." 

The Gogol jubilee has been celebrated this 
year, and has called forth the publication of 
new editions, unprinted letters, numerous 
fragments, and a large amount of critical 
discussion. 

The Spanish chronicle for the year, com- 
piled by Don Rafael Altamira, has the usual 
lengthy list of historical and antiquarian pro- 
ductions, works of little interest to others than 
specialists, which we will pass unmentioned, 
save for a note upon Canovas del Castillo, 
who has been made the subject of two biog- 
raphies. His character 

" Is certainly most interesting to an historian. He was 
a genuine representative of the Bourbon restoration, 
and also of the strange and deplorable pessimism which, 
by paralyzing the arms of many men of ability, was the 
cause of almost all our disasters during the closing 
years of the nineteenth century. But the time has not 
yet come for panegyrists, even of the utmost honesty 
of purpose, to extol his career in eulogistic phrases." 

In belles lettres " two facts are observable : 
the return of our authors to the cultivation of 
the story, from which they have been inclined 
to hold aloof of recent years, and the invasion 
of Castilian poetry by modernity." Among 
the best works of fiction are " Adventuras, 
Inventos, y Mistificaciones de Silvestre Par- 
adox," and " Camino de Perfeccion," both by 
Senor Baroja, a new writer ; " Sonata de 
Otono," by Senor Valle Inclan ; " La Con- 
quista de la Elegancia," by Senor Danvila; 
and " Sonnica la Cortesana," by Senor Blasca 
IbaSez. The annals of verse-writing and of 
the stage are of«o particular interest, although 
Senor Galdos has produced " Alma y Vida," 
an admirable symbolistic drama. 



The limited edition of Montaigne's Essays, which 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. announce, will un- 
doubtedly prove the crowning achievement of The 
Riverside Press. The Florio translation is the one 
selected, and the work will comprise three folio vol- 
umes of uncommon typographical beauty. The front- 
ispieces, decorative title-pages, and initial letters will 
all be engraved on wood, and in the bibliography there 
will be facsimile reproductions of title-pages and other 
interesting material from famous old editions.

The Xixetezxth Ckxtuky ix Review.* 



Whatever the defects of Mr. Emerson's 
" History of the Nineteenth Century Year by 
Year," it is to be said at the outset that they 
are largely inherent in the plan of his rather 
formidable undertaking. Though it is difficult 
to see how any other method of treating so 
vast a subject would have enabled him to tell 
the story better, it is certain that the presenta- 
tion of wholly dissociate matters in successive 
paragraphs, throughout his three volumes, is 
frequently disconcerting. On the other hand, 
the fact that the story as told is almost con- 
tinuously interesting, even though it runs 
through 1912 closely-printed pages, attests the 
wisdom and ability of the author at once. 
Certainly, to take up each country by itself 
and carry on its history through more than a 
hundred years would hardly have been likely 
to produce better results, while it would have 
necessitated the narration of all international 
affairs at least twice over. Carefully though 
not voluminously indexed as it is, " A History 
of the Nineteenth Century Year by Year " 
forms a valuable addition to works of reference 
in any library, at the same time that it affords 
pleasant reading as a whole. The use of mar- 
ginal annotations of topics is an assistance to 
every reader ; and the numerous illustrations, 
many of thepi in color, add to the desirability 
of the volumes. 

It has long been the belief of Americans 
that from among their number were to arise 
the great historians of the modem world. 
Holding aloof from Europe to an extent which 
lessens national prejudices to the minimum, 
able from a point of view so far removed to 
assume the attitude of " contemporaneous pos- 
terity," and pledged by reason of their nation- 
ality to regard favorably all government which 
is based upon generous and sound political 
principle rather than upon political expediency, 
it appears to be the duty of Americans to in- 
terpret to the nations of Europe the actualities 
and tendencies of their own acts. The neces- 
sity for this is the greater, in view of the fact 
that British historians, however dispassionate, 
have never been able to treat European affairs 
with the accuracy which they have bestowed

upon American affairs, and this at a time 
when identity of language enables them in a 
great measure to form American opinion in 
r^ard to the annals of the Continent of 
Europe. Here the citizens of the United States 
hold a just balance, the mixing of races and 
nationalities in our country going far toward 
divesting us of all bias. And it is of the cen- 
tury so recently closed — the century in which 
the term "chauvinism" took its rise — that 
this is especially true. 

Throughout his account of the life of the na- 
tions of the world, Mr. Emerson discloses a 
steadfast Americanism which has the courage, 
of its convictions. His work is in no sense 
philosophical, its aim being rather to collect 
and present facts than expound their tenden- 
cies. Yet his adherence to the broad dem- 
ocratic principles upon which this republic was 
founded can be discerned, though his views are 
those of the conservative rather than the radical 
believer in popular government. He has done 
wisely in using a translation, by Mr. Maurice 
Magnus, of the introduction prepared by Grer- 
vinus for his history of the nineteenth century, 
projected but never realized, as the introduc- 
tion to his own work. It brings the age just 
closed into perspective, and enables the reader 
to trace tendencies stretching far back of the 
year 1800, with which the account opens. In 
his preface, Mr. Emerson remarks : 

■■ It is the pride of Americans that their hemisphere 
has eoDtribnted its share, and over, to the snm-total 
aecomplished by the world since the death of Wash- 
ington. In the roll-eall of the great men of this age 
few names stand forth more brightly than those of 
Jefferson, Bolivar, Lincoln, Grant, Farragnt, and Lee, 
or those of Fulton, Ericsson, Morse, Edison, Diaz, aad 
Dewey. 

" Considerations snch as tbeae have entered largely 
into the preparation of this work. To them mast be 
ascribed the apparent preponderance given to the part 
played by America in the history of the world during 
the Nineteenth Century. When a similar work was 
undertaken by GerviDos, the great German historian, 
he laid the responsibility for modern statecraft and 
ideals of goremment at the feet of America." 

These words indicate that dispassionate atti- 
tude which must characterize the work of the 
true historian, and no American will quarrel 
with the setting of the affairs of the new world 
upon an equal footing with those of the old in 
a history of this kind. This is one evidence 
of the author's good faith ; another may be 
found in his inclusion of the arts of peace as 
essential factors in the world's development 
and progress, the sombre events of war and 
conquest being often brightened by citations

from the poets, while the authors, artists, and 
inventors of the age are given equal promi- 
nence with the rulers, statesmen, and warriors. 
Even matters so seemingly slight as the in- 
vention of patent leather may be found side 
by side with the echoes of the tramp of armies ; 
while the poets of all Christendom appear, 
those of foreign speech in adequate translation. 
The pages are consecutively numbered from 
the beginning to the end of the work, making 
reference easy. The style is popular, almost 
familiar, and its journalistic tendency is ad- 
mirably suited to the subject matter, — the 
history being largely a journal of the times, 
and too closely related to the present, for the 
most part, to permit of any other treatment. 

It is interesting to note that the eighteenth 
century ended, as the twentieth began, with a 
dispute regarding its initial year. Mr. Emerson 
seems to lend himself to those who would have 
the century open in a year with a round num- 
ber, by formally including the year 1800, after 
a preliminary chapter of forecast. But he also 
includes the year 1901 by way of close, so 
that his book does not add its mite toward a 
settlement of a highly unimportant dispute. 
His first volume contains a map of the world 
at the beginning of the epoch, just as the last 
includes one at its close ; in this latter there is 
a mistake in coloring, France and Great 
Britain being apparently assigned the same 
tint, though on the map itself they are duly 
differentiated. 

Where so much ground is covered, neces- 
sarily a process of selection must be adopted. 
Yet it would be unfair to draw a hard and fast 
line at any point. Mr. Emerson apparently 
intends that his work shall be interesting as 
well as important ; hence he shows a fondness 
for events that combine these two elements in 
greater or less degree. There is little oppor- 
tunity for humor, but plenty for good nature 
and human sympathy. Still, one may read of 
January, 1812, that " Wellington, to use 
Napier's expressive phrase, ' instantly jumped 
with both feet upon Ciudad Rodrigo.' " And 
there seems to be something of a moral for the 
readers of to-day in the statement respecting 
the first steamboat, that " Next, the courts 
were asked for an injunction to restrain Fulton 
from using his new machine on the Hudson." 
Wherever there has been an authoritative pre- 
sentation of any part of his broad subject by 
another, Mr. Emerson has gladly made use of 
it, duly weighing the evidence where more than 
one side has had a hearing. 



The first of the three volumes is practically 
given up to the first Napoleon. With the 
exception of the withholding of the important 
fact that the government of Great Britain 
sought to end the life of the Emperor of the 
French by assassination, there is here the fair- 
est possible statement of the life of that gigan- 
tic figure, the facts being set down without 
malice or extenuation. Even a matter coming 
so near home as the war between Great Britain 
and the United States, in 1812-14, shows no 
national prepossessions, — a return for the com- 
pliment paid Mr. Theodore Roosevelt by the 
publishers of the " History of the Royal Navy " 
in permitting him to furnish the correspond- 
ing chapter of that work. It is a downright 
pleasure to see the facts regarding the battle 
of Lundy's Lane made clear, without boasting 
of a great American victory on that hard- 
fought field. There is, however, no mention 
made of the destruction of the government 
buildings and records of York, now Toronto, 
which justified in some measure the British 
vandalism in Washington ; nor is anything 
said of Major Croghan's defense of Fort Ste- 
phenson, the most brilliant exploit of Ameri- 
can arms on land in the North, and one of 
real moment. 

The second volume carries the tale down to 
the close of 1857. Some exception will doubt- 
less be taken to this account of Poe's last mo- 
ments : " On his way to New York to settle 
up affairs in anticipation of his marriage, Poe 
fell in with some of his companions in dissipa- 
tion at Baltimore. He became drunk, wan- 
dered through the streets, and was finally 
taken to a hospital in an unconscious condi- 
tion. Later he became delirious, and finally 
expired." But here, as elsewhere, Mr. Emer- 
son's critical judgment is generally sound re- 
garding authors, as in his brief estimate of 
Poe's genius. The Mexican War falls within 
this period, and its events are presented with 
entire dispassion, as may be seen in the treat- 
ment of the battle of Buena Vista, where, as 
is noted, " Both sides claimed the victory. 
The Mexicans chanted Te Deums." 

It is in the last volume, especially in its latter 
pages, that the most exceptions will be taken 
to Mr. Emerson's selection of material. He is 
here obliged to rely upon newspaper informa- 
tion in good part, and his treatment of the 
Spanish War has nothing of the authority 
which attends his discussion of the War be- 
tween the States. An example of his writing 
at its best will be found in this extract: 



1902.]

" On the foUowiDg morning the Merrimae came out 
into the Roads to finish her work of destruction. There 
she beheld her new antagonist (the Monitor) lying 
beside the Minnesota like a ' tin can on a shingle.' 
Lieutenant Jones commanded the Merrimae in place of 
the wounded Buchanan. He realized at once that the 
new outlandish vessel was his foremost adyersarr. The 
day was suunj and bright, and crowds of spectators 
thronged the shores to behold the great duel. After 
exchanging shots with the Minnesota, the Merrimae 
eloeed with the Monitor. Both vessels pounded each 
other ineffectually. The Monitor's cast-iron balls broke 
upon the armor of the Merrimae, while the Merrimac's 
shells burst to no purpose over the Monitor's turret. 
After thus exchanging fire for two hours, the Merri- 
mac's gunners quit to save the ammunition. Manifestly 
the Monitor had an immense advantage in her superior 
speed and mauceuvring power, as well as in the greatest 
radius afforded by the revolving turret. Lieutenant 
Worden, accordingly, resolved to ram his enemy. He 
missed the Merrimae by only two feet, both ships graz- 
ing. The Merrimae retaliated in kind. Jones ran his 
stem right over the Monitor's deck, the force of the 
blow knocking down most of bis men. Before they 
conld get over the side of the ship, the Monitor glided 
away from under the Merrimae. The slow speed of 
the Merrimae saved the Monitor. It was indeed for- 
tnnate for Worden that the Merrimae had lost her ram 
on the previous day. Later the Monitor drifted into 
shoal water, and the Merrimae, unable to follow, drew 
off. Thus the engagement ended as a drawn battle. 
Neither ship had been seriously injured, nor had either 
lost a single man. The Monitor had been struck twenty- 
two times without appreciable injury. The Merrimae, 
as a result of her two days' fighting, had ninety-seven 
indentations in her armor. Bloodless as this first 
encounter between ironclads was, it proved one of the 
decisive battles of the Civil War, securing to the North 
the command of the sea. The demonstration of the 
superior merits of steam power and armor protection 
in action was so striking that it practically sealed the 
doom of the old ships." 

A carious inadvertence is to be noted in 
the following : '• While marching, the soldiers 
chanted their favorite song, ' The Battle Cry 
of Freedom,' the tune of which is known to the 
present day in America as » Marching through 
Georgia.' " The closeness with which events 
in times of peace are followed is to be seen in 
the account of the attempt of Gould and Fisk 
to secure the Albany and Susquehanna Rail- 
road, on page 1478. This is the basis of 
Messrs. Merwin and Webster's "The Short 
Line War,'' which was criticized on its publi- 
cation for telling an impossible story. The 
account of the labor disturbances of 1894 is 
given in this language : 

" In the middle of June the great Pullman car strike 
started in Chicago. In connection with this movement 
40,000 raUroad employees struck in the Western States. 
By the beginning of July the intervention of the United 
States troops was found necessary to protect interstate 
commerce and the transmission of the mails. Many 
thousands of strikers refused to allow the trains to be 



moved. Most of the remaining buildings of the Chicago 
World's Fair were set on fire, and other outrages com- 
mitted. The troops repeatedly charged the mob. At 
one time the strikers destroyed all the station yards at 
the various railroads. On the 9th of July, President 
Cleveland issued a proclamation practically declaring 
martial law in Chicago. The Federal courts punished 
those strikers that failed to obey injunctions for con- 
tempt of court. On July 16, the labor strike through- 
out the Union was practically brought to a close, and 
the Honse of Representatives thanked the President for 
his energetic action." 

Nothing could illustrate better than this 
mixture of truth and falsehood the danger of 
relying upon sensational newspaper accounts 
when there are official documents fully cover- 
ing the ground. Mr. Emerson is referred to 
the Cooper Union speech of the late Governor 
John P. Altgeld, and to the report of the com- 
mission of enquiry headed by the Hon. Carroll 
D. Wright. From these he may learn that 
the Pullman strike began in May ; that many 
more than 40,000 railway employees struck 
late in June : that the Federal troops were 
sent into Illinois, for the first time in the his- 
tory of the United States, without any request 
from the State authorities, and that they did 
practically nothing to protect interstate com- 
merce or the transmission of the mails; that 
the strikers offered at all times to move the 
mail trains : that the destruction of the World's 
Fair buildings has never been laid to the 
strikers' door, and that none of the other 
damage, which by no means included "all the 
station yards" in the city, has ever been 
brought home to the strikers in any way ; that 
the troops did not " repeatedly charge the 
mob," for the excellent reason that there were 
few mobs at any time during the strike ; and 
that the government, after sentencing the 
leaders of the strike to imprisonment for dis- 
obeying an injunction of the court in commit- 
ting a crime, abandoned voluntarily the attempt 
to prove them guilty of the identical crime on 
criminal prosecution — quorum omnia pars fui. 

It is to be regretted that Mr. Emerson says 
nothing of the offer of Spain to arbitrate all 
differences with the United States previous to 
the outbreak of the recent war ; and that 
nothing whatever is said of the several impor- 
tant battles fought by the Filipinos against 
the Spanish, by which the latter were cooped 
up in Manila. Nothing is said, either, of 
President McKinley's proclamation command- 
ing the Filipino army to lay down its arms, 
which was the beginning of the war of subju- 
gation : nor of the extension of the American 
lines beyond the limits set by the protocol,

which was the provoking cause of actua! hos- 
tilities. Nor is anything said of the provisions 
of the Treaty of Paris regarding the friars in 
the Philippines, which has been the cause of 
so much of the trouble in the archipelago. 
When Mr. Emerson says, discussing the " bot- 
tling up " of Cervera's squadron in the harbor 
of Santiago by Schley, " His resulting loose 
tactics, it is asserted, caused him to be super- 
seded by Captain Sampson, his inferior in 
rank," he is in error, Sampson having been 
put over Schley at the outbreak of hostilities. 
The account of the war in South Africa 
and the controversies leading to it would have 
been much the gainer if Mr. Emerson had 
made himself familiar with the short history 
written by Mr. F. W. Gooch for " The Heart 
of the Empire." But here the annalist may 
shield himself behind his privilege of selec- 
tion, it being manifestly impossible to include 
everything and keep his work within practical 
bounds. Generally speaking, the " History 
of the Nineteenth Century " is a worthy book 
and a valuable addition to historical literature.

An American Physician in Russian 
Prisons.* 



Among the many books and articles that 
have been written upon the treatment of Eus- 
sian prisoners and exiles, Dr. Howard's work 
is unique in that it is written from inside 
knowledge of that which it describes. As the 
author says in his Introduction, the ordinary 
investigator labors under so many disadvan- 
tages that he cannot know the real facts; he 
must depend upon the accounts of officials or 
of prisoners whose statements he cannot verify ; 
his visits are known beforehand and carefully 
prepared for. *' But the daily routine of the 
ordinary actual life of prisoners and exiles, in 
prison and out of prison, when no traveller is 
near; the ordinary methods and life of the 
officials ; the actual working of the system in 
its different details and departments, — these 
may be as unknown to this traveller at the 
end of his trip as when he started. Of these 
things, seen from the inside, the English- 
speaking public is still practically ignorant." 

Dr. Howard has written from full personal 
knowledge. He has been a student of life and

Life in Sakhalin and Siberia. By Benjamin Howard, M.A.,

of man on every continent ; and, what is bet- 
ter, his studies and activities have brought 
about permanent good for society in more than 
one direction. He was an English boy who 
came to America because it seemed to be pos- 
sible for him to get a college education here. 
Graduating from Williams College a few years 
before the Civil War, the same eager interest 
in men that led him afterwards to give years 
to the investigation of prison conditions in the 
various countries of the world, led him to be- 
come a clerk in a St. Louis slave-market, in 
order that he might get at the facts of slavery. 
These facts kindled a burning hatred of the 
institution, and he nearly lost his life in the 
attempt to serve as an agent of the " under- 
ground railway " in connection with his service 
in the slave-market. He served with honor in 
the Northern army, to the permanent injury of 
his health. In his profession he was remark- 
ably successful, both at home and abroad. The 
prevalent method of resuscitation of persons 
seemingly drowned was worked out by him, 
and is known by his name. A pleasant in- 
cident is recorded of his life in the remote 
corner of the earth which the present book 
describes. 

" The reports of a drowning accident had caused me 
to hurry down to the beach, where I found Dr. A. en- 
deavoring to resuscitate the patient. Asking him where 
be had learned the method of artificial respiration he 
was employing, he told me that it was the American 
method, known as the ' direct method ' of Professor 
Howard, and that he had learned it in St. Petersburg. 
He was immensely astonished at finding that the person 
who was showing his pleasure in the returning life of the 
patient was himself the author of the method; and from 
that day onward, both in the hospital and out of it, 
Dr. A. treated me with as much consideration and respect 
as if I were the senior physician of the post, and he 
merely an assistant." 

Dr. Howard has received the credit of being 
the originator, and largely the organizer, of 
the London Ambulance Service. His influence 
was strong in the same direction in Paris. His 
medical writings are highly esteemed by the 
profession. During the whole of his active life 
of forty years he was especially interested in 
the different convict systems of the world, the 
study of criminology and prison reform. Gen- 
eral O. O. Howard says, in the Preface, that 
the author went through the principal prisons 
of England, Germany, and the United States, 
and through every convict prison between St. 
Petersburg and Siberia ; in Russia he travelled 
many hundred miles, in hourly contact with 
five hundred exiles, by road, river, and rail. 
He made practical studies of the Armenians'

troubles in their midst. He went again and 
again into the Russian Jew question, and was 
twice put under arrest, utterly uncertain as to I 
what mieht await him. Such is the man to 
whom we are indebted for this interesting and 
authoritative account of Russian prison ad- 
ministration in the most remote of her convict 
settlements, to which only the most hardened 
and depraved criminals are sent, — the bleak 
island of Sakhalin, out in the ocean beyond 
Siberia. 

The narrative opens with a description of 
Vladivostok, important as the eastern terminus 
of the Trans-Siberian railway, as it was ten 
years ago. Dr. Howard was allowed to go 
through every part of the prison at that place, 
without any opportunity having been given to 
prepare for his coming : and to talk freely 
with any of the prisoners, apart from guide or 
official. While there was great slackness in 
the administration, according to Western ideas, 
and abundant filth, he found no evidence of 
such general harshness as we have been ac- 
customed to associate with Russian prison ad- 
ministration. The combination of tact and 
assurance that enabled Dr. Howard to pene- 
trate where all others had failed to penetrate, 
and to get all that he wanted where others had 
failed to get anything, is a cause of constant 
admiration to the reader. He succeeded in 
making confidential friends at sight of chiefs 
of police, prison officials, governors of pro- 
vinces, and all others, apparently, who could be 
useful to him. It was not in his plans to visit 
Sakhalin, though he was deeply interested in 
the place as completing the penal system of 
Siberia, being the place to which the incorri- 
gibles were sent : but no foreigner had been 
allowed to visit the island, and he did not sup- 
pose that a way could be opened for him. But 
it was his good fortune to dine one evening 
where the Governor of the island was a guest, 
returning from his annual holiday trip : this 
official gave him a hearty invitation to be his 
guest for the summer, and Dr. Howard was 
only too glad to accept it. 

The descriptions of the life of the officials 
in their remote place of exile, as well as of the 
soldiers, and the convicts of various grades, 
are most interesting, and there are many things 
that would be well worth quoting if space 
allowed. Though there were but a few free 
Russians there, this very isolation brought out 
national or race characteristics, as well as in- 
dividual character, with startling clearness. 
One gets an insight into the religious and in- 



tellectual life of the average Russian that 
could not be gained by contact with the people 
under ordinary conditions. Through his pro- 
fession and the admiration that Dr. A. felt for 
him. Dr. Howard had free access to the hos- 
pital through his stay on the island. 

" While, on the one hand, Dr. A. professed that the 
hospital was greatly indebted to me, I, on the other 
hand, declared that I was mnch more indebted to it, 
there being no other spot on the island where I could 
so well and deeply have studied the pathology of the 
exile system as here, whither eame everything whieh 
most deeply testified against it. On the slightest excose 
every exile and convict claims his right of seeing the 
doctor, and it is impossible, therefore, fop any cruelty 
or abuse of any kind whatsoever to continue long in 
operation without some evidence of it coming under the 
eye of the physician. . . . Thus the doctor has his 
finger literally on the pulse of the physical and moral 
life of the whole settlement all the time. It would be 
too flattering to say that this hospital was my observa- 
tory. It was my chemical and pathological laboratory." 

With this prolonged opportunity for close 
study of the Russian penal system among the 
worst convicts, in a place remote from official 
inspection and control, considered even in 
Russia to be a hell, almost out of the world, it 
will be a surprise to many that the conclusions 
of this competent observer are distinctly favor- 
able to its fundamental idea, as compared with 
the penal systems of England and America. 
This fundamental idea is " the utilization of 
the prisoner for the highest good of the state." 

" The state does not seek to punish the prisoner, but 
to profit by him. The segregation of the prisoner to 
the service of the state implies protection of society 
from the criminal. In accordance with the general 
imperial policy as described, the minute the prisoner 
arrives at his Siberian destination, he is asked what he 
ean do best. If there is no pressing reason to the eoa- 
trary, he is at once employed accordingly. If he has 
DO special skill, he is put to such work as the settle- 
ment most needs. Or, if the prisoner shows special 
capacity, he may be put nnder training in one of the 
prison shops as an apprentice. If during his probation- 
ary prison period be has commended himself, he is not 
oniv allowed to do the best he can for himself outside 
the prison under mild surveillance, but, to get started, 
may receive temporary help from the officials, subject 
to reimbursement at fixed rates. This especially applies 
to agricultural laborers, who receive allotments of land, 
clothes, rations, implements, cattle, seed, etc., for two 
years. This is done systematically by the state, not 
for the good of the prisioner, but for its own benefit. 
Scattered throughout Siberia, in its towns and cities, 
are scores of millionaires, the results of that system; 
and the more of these the better the Government likes 
it, because this all reacts to the benefit of the state. 
. . . Under this system the Russian Government does 
not waste its murderers, but, like a wise sanitary engi- 
neer dealing with sewage, protects society against them 
by removing them and then utilizing them, so that, 
instead of loss, the state gets an actual profit. That 
there is punishment to the prisoner from first to last.

incidental to bis segregation, is inevitable, but it is 
incidental." 

The cruelties of which we read, — the com- 
mon accounts of which Dr. Howard believes to 
have been generally exaggerated, though he 
himself gives some very revolting instances of 
prison punishments of the worst grade of of- 
fenders, — he ascribes to the maladministration 
inevitable under an absolute government, and 
under conditions of remoteness from the central 
authority. We commend our readers to the 
author's chapter on this subject, including an 
elaborate comparison of results with those of 
England and America. 

The book is full of interest for its vivid de- 
scriptions, as well as for the information it 
contains. One chapter tells of the punishment 
by the knout, one case of which the author, 
alone of foreigners, saw and followed up by 
hospital observation. Another chapter is on 
the physiognomy and the remorse of mur- 
derers, — and with ten thousand of them around 
him through a whole summer. Dr. Howard had 
ample material for study. q jj. Cooper. 



CUSHING AND HIS WORK AMONG THE 

ZuNi Indians.* 



Mr. Cushing's life at Zuni is perhaps the 
incident in American anthropological research 
which is best known to the general public. 
He was probably the first of our ethnologists 
who actually took up his abode in an Indian 
town merely for purposes of study. In mag- 
azine articles and lectures, he has himself 
given us glimpses of his life at Zuni — of his 
reception by the kindly old governor, of his 
experiences with his fellow-townsmen, of his 
adoption into their priesthoods. Other writers 
from time to time have given further details ; 
among the most interesting of these descrip- 
tions is an article entitled " An Aboriginal 
Pilgrimage," in which the journey of the 
Zuni priests to the Ocean of Sunrise is de- 
lightfully chronicled. Few persons, however, 
have ever realized fully the hardships and 
trials and disease which the earnest investi- 
gator suffered in pursuing his investigations. 

Did time and space permit, we would gladly 
sketch Cushing's life-work; but we can only 
refer to a few points. The work Cushing did 
was preeminently practical. At Zuni, he spoke

Hamilton Cnshing. With introduction by J. W. Powell,

the language of the people, he wore their dress 
he ate their food ; he assisted in their councils, 
he participated in their ceremonials. When 
studying an art or an industry, he was only 
satisfied after he had himself mastered the 
technique. Was it pottery ? — he must him- 
self shape a vessel ; was it weaving ? — he 
must himself fabricate a blanket ; was it arrow- 
making? — he must himself be able to smooth 
the stick, to feather the shaft, to shape the 
point. When investigating mythologies, his 
mystical and poetical nature came easily into 
rapport with those of the shamans whose cos- 
mogonic legends he was writing down. 

Unfortunately, Cushing wrote but little. 
Brief articles by him, of uneven value, are 
widely scattered through periodicals ; there are 
fragmentary reports of the archaeological ex- 
pedition into the Salt River Valley ; Edna 
Dean Proctor's " Song of the Ancient People " 
was inspired and commentated by him. Three 
papers of the highest importance appeared in 
annual Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology — 
" Zuni Fetiches," " A Study of Pueblo Pot- 
tery," " Outlines of Zuiii Creation Myths." In 
connection with the Pepper- Hearst Expedition, 
he published a " Preliminary Report on the 
Exploration of Ancient Key-dweller Remains 
on the Gulf-coast of Florida." The work here 
reported was one of the most startling and in- 
teresting in all American archaeology. In his 
last years, Mr. Cushing worked in collabora- 
tion with Dr. Culin, of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, upon Indian games ; and a report of 
their work will appear in the future. 

Valuable as this work is, and considerable 
as it would be for an ordinary investigator, it 
is small in comparison with the enormous mass 
of material which Cushing must have gathered 
during his years of industry, the greater part 
of which will probably never see the light. 
We are grateful, then, in a special degree, for 
the fact that some of that material, left almost 
ready for publication by the author, now ap- 
pears as a handsome book under the title of 
" Zuni Folk-Tales." It has been published 
under the care of an editorial committee, of 
which Dr. F. W. Hodge is the active member. 
It is a worthy memorial of Cushing, the man 
and the student. An excellent portrait of him 
forms the frontispiece ; an introduction by 
Major Powell follows ; then come thirty-three 
stories ; a dozen capital scenes at Zuni and 
pictures of Pueblo life are scattered through 
the volume. Paper, print, and binding are of 
the best.

The stories themselves are not the great 
legends of the tribe. They are not the co»- 
mogonic story, nor the migration legend, nor 
the hero myth, — though cosmogonic and mi- 
gration and hero elements occur in them. They 
are rather the simple, every-day, popular tales. 
Many of them deal with the twin heroes, " the 
beloved twain "; their adventures in destroying 
monsters, in freeing captives, in making love, 
are favorite popular themes. Others are coyote 
stories ; this animal, at once cunning and a 
fool, is always trying to imitate others, and 
always getting into difficulty. In these animal 
tales, considerable shrewdness and keen obser- 
vation of animal life and character are shown. 
Other stories tell of the adventurer of poor and 
neglected youths or maidens, and of warriors 
bold. 

Naturally, one of the great values of the 
collection is the light that is incidentally thrown 
by it upon the life of the people to whom it 
relates. Modes of hunting, dress, fondness for 
ornament, tools, weapons, implements, forms 
of civility, modes of courting, — these and a 
hundred other ethnographic facts are brought 
ont. A second value of the collection is the 
opportunity it gives for comparison with other 
tales ; this is equally great, whether we see in 
such resemblances evidence of contact or a 
common origin, or merely exemplification of 
the uniform action of the hnman mind every- 
where when similar conditions are presented. 
Some resemblances in these Zuni tales to stories 
told elsewhere are fairly startling, and raise 
many interesting questions. Lastly, these 
stories give glimpses of racial psychology. And 
here the simplicity and directness of Cushing's 
transcription is important. Interesting indeed 
are the runs, or formal phrases, which recur 
again and again, but especially at the beginning 
and end of tales. The poetical strain which 
runs through many, and the bold employment 
of metaphor and other figures, are delightful. 
Constantly, too, we gain a knowledge of the 
animistic ideas of the Indian and of his mon- 
sters, divine beings, etc. 

The editor of the volume has wisely omitted 
comment and explanation. Notes and sug- 
gestions, unless Cushing's own, would have 
fitted badly. As it stands, the book will ap- 
peal to two sets of readers. Many will read 
it for itself ; for it has a quaintness, a flavor, 
a charm, and a character that warrant its gen- 
eral reading. It will be read by the student 
for its folk-lore content and its ethnographic 
importance. And for whatever reason it is 



read, or by whatever readers, it will increase 
knowledge of, and sympathy for, those simple 
Zuni folk with whom Gushing lived and whom 
he loved. The general reader does not wish 
annotation : the scientific investigator will sup- 
ply his own. One story of the collection, 
indeed, is reprinted from the " Journal of 
American Folk-lore "; it is told for the sci- 
entist, and has Cushing's own notes. It has 
its value, but its simplicity, its charm, its soul, 
are lost in the preparation of it for the scien- 
tific reader only. We can but be glad that the 
others are not annotated ; that they speak more 
to the heart and less to the mind : that they 
appeal first to the man, and then to the scholar. 
Such a form of narration is the most fitting in 
a book which is to stand before the world as a 
monument to Frank Hamilton Cushing.

The Way to Social Salvation*.* 



"Forsooth, brothers, fellowship is heaven, 
and lack of fellowship is hell : . . . Therefore, 
I bid you not dwell in hell, but in heaven : or 
while ye must, upon earth, which is a part of 
heaven, and forsooth no foul part." Thus did 
William Morris, in the year 1889, voice the 
gospel of the twentieth century ; which, upon 
close examination, is fonnd to bear a striking 
resemblance to that of the first. It was not so 
long ago that the works of Dr. Samuel Smiles 
were held to contain the best possible advice 
for the coming generation, and the young man 
was reminded that every citizen of the United 
States was eligible for the presidency. Even 
to-day we are constantly assured of the truth 
that •' there is always room at the top," though 
it is not explained how the top would remain 
elevated if the bottom rose as advised. Yet 
the times are changing, and human society is 
coming to realize that it is something more 
than an aggregation of individuals. The social 
instincts, which have necessarily existed from 
the beginning of the species, are being increas- 
ingly supplemented by the social intelligence, 
and thus mankind seems in a fair way to learn

how to use that sharp two-edged tool with 
which he has so often cut his fingers. 

The works before us illustrate the relation 
between supply and demand. They have not 
been written, like popular novels, to amuse the 
public and enrich the authors. Their purpose 
is serious, and they have all cost more labor, no 
doubt, than can be fairly recompensed by any 
possible financial returns. Nevertheless, they 
are the articulate expression of a widespread 
cry, " What shall we do to be saved ? " They 
are characteristic of the twentieth century, — 
if we may venture to see characteristics in a 
babe so young. 

Though comparisons are often unfair, we 
think it not amiss to say at the outset that 
Miss Jane Addams's " Democracy and Social 
Ethics " is by far the best book of the lot. It 
is, what the others are not, a study at close 
range ; and yet it has not the common fault of 
such studies, of lacking a philosophic ground- 
work. Miss Addams knows her people as 
individuals, yet never loses sight of their rela- 
tionship to society. If we may venture to 
formulate her remedy for existing social evils, 
we may say perhaps that it is to give each in- 
dividual such knowledge of and concern for 
his social status as he now has for his indi- 
vidual status. By social status we here mean 
not his rank in society, — not, in short, the 
way society treats him, — but the way he 
treats society, his utility and efficiency therein. 
By thus shifting and broadening his interests, 
the pyramid, which formerly stood upon its 
apex, is placed securely on its base, and that 
with no loss of individuality. If anyone 
doubts the last statement, let him consider 
the case of Miss Addams herself. Educational 
methods are criticised because of their failure 
to give the ordinary workman an understanding 
of the meaning of his work. 

" The man in the factory, as well as the man with the 
hoe, has a grievance beyond being overworked and dis- 
inherited, in that he does not know what it is all 
about. ... If a workingman is to have a conception of 
his value at all, he must see industry in its unity and 
entirety; he must have a conception that will include 
not only himself and his immediate family and com- 
munity, but the industrial organisation as a whole." 

We may perhaps leave the book with one more 
significant quotation. 

" It is as yet most difficult for us to free ourselves 
from the individualistic point of view sufficiently to 
group events in their social relations and to judge fairly 
those who are endeavoring to produce a social result 
through all the difficulties of associated action. The 
philanthropist still finds his path much easier than do 
those who are attempting a social morality. In the 



first place, the public, anxious to praise what it recog- 
nizes as an undoubted moral effort often attended with 
real personal sacrifice, joyfully seizes upon this mani- 
festation and overpraises it, recognising the philan- 
thropist as an old friend in the paths of righteousness, 
whereas the others are strangers and possibly to be 
distrusted as aliens. It is easy to confuse the response 
to an abnormal number of individual claims with the 
response to the social claim. An exaggerated personal 
morality is often mistaken for a social morality, and 
until it attempts to minister to a social situation its 
total inadequacy is not discovered." 

Dr. Gladden, in " Social Salvation," pub- 
lishes a series of lectures which were delivered 
in March of the present year before the stu- 
dents of the Divinity School of Yale Univer- 
sity. The lectures are addressed to men who 
are preparing for the ministry ; but Dr. Glad- 
den justly considers that they will be found no 
less interesting to the lay public. The subjects 
are seven : " Religion and the Social Question," 
" The Care of the Poor," " The State and the 
Unemployed," " Our Brothers in Bonds," 
" Social Vices," " Public Education," " The 
Redemption of the City." As might be ex- 
pected, the style is clear and forcible, and there 
are many passages worth remembering. Per- 
haps the following is the most significant of 
the tenor of the work, and of the tendencies 
we have referred to : 

" The truth is that Democracy, with universal suf- 
frage, is our dispensation; we are in for it, and we must 
fight it out along that line; if we are to be saved at all, 
we must be saved by the people; if we are to be re- 
formed, the reform must spring from the intelligent 
choice of the people; it must express their wishes; the 
notion that by some sort of hocus-pocus we can get 
society reformed without letting the people know it 
does undoubtedly haunt the brains of some astute 
political promoters, but it will not work." 

And again : 

" The city of the future which we saw in our dream 
is simply a great community cooperative for the public 
good, and in order that the cooperation may be effect- 
ive, the people must know what is good and how to 
cooperate. And this involves a mighty change in the 
characters of multitudes of them! " 

Dr. Gladden, like Miss Addams, finds fault 
with the social conduct of persons who in pri- 
vate affairs are above reproach. He says : 

" The thoroughgoing partisanship of the reputable 
people is another prime cause of bad government. The 
great majority of moral and upright citizens can be re- 
lied on to vote the regular ticket if Beelzebub is the 
nominee. This infatuation affects deacons and elders 
of churches, Sunday-school superintendents, staid pro- 
fessional men, great multitudes of citizens who are on 
most other subjects tolerably sane." 

Yet, with all this, one does not feel that Dr. 
Gladden has been able entirely to free himself 
from a certain bias of caste ; he seems, as it

were, to remain elevated in his polpit, looking 
over the heads of his people rather than meet- 
ing them face to face. Perhaps this impres- 
sion would not have arisen except by contraat 
with Miss Addams's simply direct and frankly 
Democratic book : but the following passage is 
illnstrative of the attitude referred to : 

"There are always, in snch times [of depression of 
trade], individuals who have a little money and much 
good-will, and who feel called upon to give liberally to 
5ie relief funds to be administered by certain charities. 
It would be better if they would begin some enterprise 
of repair or improvement upon their houses or their 
grounds and would set idle men at work upon it, pay- 
ing out as wages what they intend to give in charity. 
If the work is not greatly needed, it will be a far 
greater benefaction to furnish it than to bestow alms 
upon idle laborers. In view of the fact that the work 
is not needed, the wages offered may fairly be less than 
tboM paid in flash times, and the trade-unions, in such 
niKwi, should relax their demands. Thus there is an 
economic adjustment, and the man of good-will serves 
himself as well as his neighbor by getting his work 
done more cheaply in the hard times." 

Mr. M. A. Lane's " The Level of Social 
Motion " is, as its sub-title indicates, " an in- 
qairy into the future conditions of human 
society." In the course of ten chapters the 
author discusses at great length such subjects 
as " The Flow of Moral Energy," " Organism 
and Environment," " The Increment of Psychic 
Capacity," " Social Kinetics," " The Law of 
Capitalization," and so forth, hinting every 
now and then at a law which he has discovered 
which will shed a flood of light on the intricate 
questions considered. In Chapter XI. at last 
we read, " the time has now come to lay before 
the reader the supreme conclusion of oar 
theory." This conclusion is, that " the hnman 
population of the earth is moving with acceler- 
ating force toward a mean, or normal number, 
which, when once reached, can never again be 
disturbed." This is explained by the suppo- 
sition that as wealth is generally diffused, in- 
telligence will become universal ; and as it is 
snp|>osed that an increased use of the brain 
checks fertility, the race will begin to diminish 
in numbers. Hereupon, however, the most 
fertile individuals will be preserved by natural 
selection, and the result will be an increased 
but more stupid population. This increase, 
however, will again be checked by the demand 
which will arise for intelligent mates, and sexual 
selection will restore the equilibrium. This is 
a very brief statement of the author's position, 
but we hope it is accurate. For his own part, 
the writer of these lines can only say that he 
has given many hours to the study of the book, 
and has read the " supreme conclusion " twice, 



but is quite unable to make sense of it. The 
author appears to be sincere and diligent, and 
of course incidentally says many things which 
are true ; bat we think he has built him a house 
of gossamer. 

Dr. A. C. Hall, in his " Crime in its Bela- 
tion to Social Progress," defines a crime as 
" any act or omission to act, punished by society 
as a wrong against itself." A sin, therefore, 
is not necessarily a crime, nor is a crime in- 
variably a sin ; moreover, a crime must be an 
offense that is punished, not merely threatened 
with punishment by statute. From this con- 
ception of crime, which is endorsed by the best 
authorities, it follows that it cannot exist except 
in organized societies, and that it increases 
with civilization. All progressive societies are 
continually creating new crimes, and the num- 
ber of persons violating the law is thereby in- 
creased. For example, in England numbers 
of people are now annually arrested for cruelty 
to animals, not sending their children to school, 
and not complying with the vaccination act, — 
crimes which were unimaginable as snch nof 
long ago. Dr. Hall therefore insists that we 
should regard the increase of " criminals," not 
with alarm, but actually as a sign of social 
health and progress. We may look forward 
to a time when crime will be unknown owing 
to the perfect socialization of every individual ; 
but in the meanwhile — and it must be a long 
while — progress toward this ideal condition is 
necessarily accompanied by friction, manifest- 
ing itself as crime. For the rest, the bulk of 
the book consists of an interesting historical 
study of crime ; a little too like a scrap-book, 
we think, while some of the stories of animal 
crimes are likely to afford merriment to the 
scoffer. T. D. A. Cockerell.

daughter of the letter-writer. The fact that Vol-

writer, read them, and praised them as both enter- 
taining and nseful, is their sufficient endorsement. 
The state of English society revealed by them is 
not exactly calculated to make one a praiser of the 
past. The young foreigner witnessed the hanging 
of the notorious Jonathan Wild, an execution that 
was regretted by many good people on the ground 
that they should thenceforth have no one to whom 
to go to recover their stolen property at half its 
value, — this system of money-raising on stolen 
goods having been brought to a state of perfection 
by the robber-captain. Criminals were executed 
every six weeks at Tyburn, in batches of five, ten, 
and even fifteen. Popular amusements were of a 
most degrading character. Water, although abun- 
dant and good, was unknown as a beverage, says 
the author. More grain is said to have been used 
for beer than for bread. An especially entertain- 
ing chapter is devoted to the coronation of George 
II. and Queen Caroline. The coronation proces- 
sion was composed of seventy-two divisions and was 
^f unprecedented " pomp and magnificence." A 
carious after-piece to the banquet at Westminster 
Hall was the letting in of the populace after the 
invited guests had dined and departed. The result 
was the speedy disappearance, not only of every- 
thing eatable and drinkable, but of all things mov- 
able as well, including the tables and benches. 
Nine illustrations and a map, from contemporary 
sources, add to the value and interest of this highly

done her part that the reader is reminded of bis 
debt to her only by the title-page and the preface.

bodies all lines of progress in recent 
years in the field of theoretical and experimental 
optics has led Professors C. R. Mann and R. A. 
Millikan of the University of Chicago to bring 
out a translation of Drude's " Theory of Optics " 
(Longmans). The great merit of this work lies in 
the fact that it includes an authoritative presenta- 
tion of the results of original work in the past 
decade in this field of physics, by a leader in the 
science. Indeed, the book itself, in the section 
devoted to physical optics, contains some original 
hypotheses of the author. We find here, for the 
first time in English, a satisfactory presentation of 
the theory of optical instruments as elaborated by 
Abbe and his followers. In the department of 
physical optics, the author sets forth very fully the 
electromagnetic theory as to the nature of light. 
The ion-hypothesis of Helmholtz is adopted as the 
simplest, most intelligible, and most consistent way 
of presenting dispersion, absorption, and rotary 
polarization, as well as magneto-optical phenomena 
and the optical properties of bodies in motion. 



The discussion of the relation of optics to thermo- 
dynamics and to the kinetic theory of gases serves 
not only to illustrate the interrelations of the sci- 
ences, but also to demonstrate the virility with 
which this domain of science has been exploited. 
There is nothing better in English, or in any other 
language, which gives in such small compass so full 
and complete a presentation of the science of mod- 
ern optics. The book is written for the physicist, 
and presupposes a knowledge of differential and 
integral calculus. In the preface to the translation, 
Professor Michelson states that no one who desires 
to gain an insight into the most modern aspects of 
optical research can afford to be unfamiliar with 
this remarkably original and consecutive presenta- 
tion of the subject of optics. 

Charles Dudley Warner's last vol- 

Tc'"A"wJ!L. «">« °« «««»y« (Dodd) will bring 
pleasure to countless readers, glad 
of an opportunity to have him discourse to them 
once more with all his old-time grace and lucidity. 
The title of the book, " Fashions in Literature," 
taken from the opening essay, is hardly represen- 
tative. Many of the papers were originally ad- 
dresses, and their topics are more often social than 
literary. The education of the negro, the charac- 
teristics of the American newspaper, the proper 
disposition of criminals, the civic ideals we should 
strive toward and the national conditions we must 
face, the relation of literature to the stage and of 
truth to literature, — all these diverse matters are 
discussed with characteristic lightness of touch and 
suggestive largeness of view. Most of the papers 
belong to the closing years of a long and full life, 
but there is no trace in them of the acerbity or dis- 
illusionment of age. Instead, we find genial humor, 
unfailing but not unreasoning optimism, and infec- 
tious enthusiasm for the best in American life and 
letters ; and we close the book with a sense of 
widened reach and deepened insight that it is within 
the gift of few American men of letters to impart. 

"The man who publishes a book 
i^^Laiina without an index ought to be damned 

ten miles beyond Hell, where the 
Devil could not get for stinging-nettles." Such 
was the opinion of John Baynes, as quoted in Mr. 
Henry B. Wheailey's volume on " How to Make 
an Index " (London : Elliot Stock); and those who 
have frequent occasion to refer to indexless books 
will be apt to endorse the imprecation. Mr. Wheat- 
ley's work is issued as the final volume in " The 
Book-Lover's Library," and forms, we should say, 
the most needed and useful title in this attractive 
series. The practical directions as to index-making, 
occupying about half the book, are the result of 
long experience, and contain suggestions which 
even the expert will find profitable. The remain- 
ing chapters are semi-historical in character, deal- 
ing with such subjects as " Amusing and Satirical 
Indexes," "The Bad Indexer," and "The Good

Indezer." Both in the practical and historical 
sections. Mr. Wheatley contrives to write entertain- 
ingly. Among the examples which he cites of ladi- 
croas blunders in index-making there appears the 
famous one of 

" Mill on Liberty, 
on the Floas," 

and also one, more recent, of the same kind, — 
" Patd, Adeliiia, 
Ojster." 

though for this latter Mr. Wbeatley does not roach. 
There is also quoted that time-honored entry of 
''Best (Mr. Justice), his great mind." sapposed to 
be a reference to the passage *■ Mr. Justice Best 
said that he had a great mind to commit the man 
for trial." The closing chapter of the book is a 
well-argued plea in behalf of a general or universal 
index, in the course of which Mr. Wheatley pays just 
tribute to the memory of Dr. W. F. Poole, greatest 
of American indexers. The volume concludes, as 
it should, with an index which stands as a model 
of the author's precepts. 

The history of England during the 
Ci^Sjjrf - -. ^*t^fil seventeenth century has ever 

been a subject of perennial interest, 
but it is only in our own time that modern methods 
of historical research are gradually giving final 
shape to that history. Mr. C. H. Firth, whose life 
of Cromwell is rightly praised as the work of a 
real historian, has followed it up by "Cromwell's 
Army : A History of the English Soldier during the 
Civil Wars, the Commonwealth, and the Protec- 
torate; being the Ford Lectures delivered in the 
University of Oxford in 1900-1 " (James Pott & 
Co.). Mr. Firth is a civilian, but he found that he 
could not study the history of the Great R«bellion 
without studying the military history as much as 
the political or the religious history. After showing 
the utter inefficiency of the armies and the military 
organization of the earlier part of the century, he 
gives us an elaborate and authoritative discussion 
of the army as remodelled by Cromwell. As is 
necessary in treating of this army alone, there are 
chapters on Religion in the Army and Politics in 
the Army. The work is a real contribution to the 
history of the period. 

c,,^ fyi^ The expectations aroused by the title 

OrmmdDuehm " A Grand Duchess and her Court " 



"'■ (Dutton) are doubly dbappointed. 
Without seeing the sub-title, " And the Classical 
Circle of Weimar," even the semi-initiated knew 
that the particular duchess was Anna Amalia or 
Louise of Saxe- Weimar. The handsome outfitting 
of the two large volumes was a confirmation of 
the anticipated treat. But alas, for a lost op|>ortn- 
nity ! To portray the court of Saxe-Weimar in its 
best estate was a task challenging the highest grade 
of critical, historical, and literary skill. It could 
not be done well without an intimate knowledge 
and appreciation of the great German authors who 
frequented that court, and it ought to have been 



ondertaken only by a person of broad and cosmo- 
politan spirit who could judge both human beings 
and monarchs. The author of the present book, 
F. Gerard, manifests none of these qualifications. It 
is the product apparently of a " Ejunmerjungfer," 
with all her worshipful and tremulous awe of titles, 
her interest in costumes and tittle-tattle, her igno- 
rance of literature and the deep interests of indi- 
Tidaals and nations, and her abominable English. 
Qootation-marks around pet words, italics for others, 
French and German words unnecessarily introduced 
and elaborately explained, commonplace informa- 
tion conscientiously injected into parentheses and 
foot-notes, and everywhere the showman's " Let as 
next " and the fondly cherished editorial " We," — 
all these could be forgiven if only there were soma 
strong quality to compensate. Anna Amalia does 
not lack heroic and pathetic elements, but they are 
not here. Her daily life would have been an inter- 
esting study in the court manners of the eighteenth 
century, but it is not here. Her relations with 
Goethe and Schiller are more interesting than those 
with Wieland — though less intimate ; but these also 
are not here. The court of the Grand Duchess has 
yet to be described in all its more interesting and 
vital features. 

A Tmriinfim '^^ flood of Napoleon literatare 
tf S a r t i— m i t continues unabated, as is shown by 
*'■'■"" the publishers' lists of the current 

season. Among these books are some of originality 
and importance, neither of which qualities can be 
attributed to Mr. Charles Josselyn's •• The True 
Napoleon, a Cylopedia of the Events of his Life " 
(B. H. Bossell). Yet the work is not without 
interest. It is made np of a great number of para- 
graphs taken from well-known books and woven 
together into four chapters, each dealing with a 
portion of Napoleon's life. There is the semblance 
of narrative, the author from whom the paragraph 
is taken being noted in the margin ; but there is 
little connection of substance, and there is no index. 
While the book cannot bat be full of interesting 
things, its main value would seem to be in furnish- 
ing desultory reading for those who already have 
knowledge of Napoleon's life and work. The 
book is beautifully made and illustrated.

reading. The use of actual illustrations in the way

though fairly numerous, are brief, and merely 
stimulative to further reading on the part of the 
student. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Grimm Library," published in London by Mr. 
David Nutt, is a series of scholarly studies of literary 
origiDS, mostly by young and ambitious investigators. 
The several volumes deal, among other subjects, with 
the Perseus legends, the Cachallin Story, the legends 
of Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot, and the home of the 
Eddie poems. This latter work, by the way, is by no 
less a scholar than Herr Sophus Bugge, and the trans- 
lation is by Mr. W. H. Schofleld. The latest addition 
to the series is a study of the epic theme of a combat 
between father and son. It is entitled " Sohrab and 
Rustem," is written by Mr. Murray Anthony Potter, 
and was prepared as a thesis for the Harvard doctorate. 

A " Companion to English History (Middle Ages)," 
by Mr. Francis Pierrepont Barnard, is a book that 
teachers and students alike will find of great helpful- 
ness in their work. There are twelve sections, each 
the work of an eminent special authority. Among 
them may be mentioned " Ecclesiastical Architecture," 
by the Rev. Arthur Galton ; " Costume, Military and 
Civil," by Mr. A. Hartshorne ; " Town Life," by 
Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith; " Monasticism," by the 
Rev. Augustus Jessopp; "Learning and Education," 
by Mr. R. S. Rait; and "Heraldry," by the editor. 
Each section has a bibliography, and the whole work 
is illustrated by nearly a hundred full-page plates. 
The Oxford Clarendon Press (Mr. Henry Frowde) 
publishes this important educational work. 

Rossetti and Rembrandt are the subjects of the first 
two volumes in the " Popular Library of Art," edited 
by Mr. Edward Garnett and published in this country 
by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. The volumes are of 
pocket size, attractively made and liberally illustrated. 
The treatment is mainly critical, with no more attention 
to biographical facts than is necessary. In the volume 
on Rossetti, Mr.Ford M. HuefEer makes an eSort to treat 
his difficult subject impartially, and succeeds fairly 
well. In spite of a style which is too often careless, 
the essay is perhaps as good a critical account, in small 
compass, of Rossetti's art-work as we now have. The 
illustrations include several interesting sketches not 
hitherto reproduced except in Mr. Marillier's costly 
volume. M. Auguste Brlal's essay on Rembrandt is 
illustrated entirely from the artist's etchings and 
original drawings in the British Museum. 

"The Teaching of History and Civics in the Elemen- 
tary and Secondary School," by Professor Henry E. 
Bourne, is a volume of the "American Teachers' 
Series " published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
It is a much-needed volume, and its scope is com- 
mensurate with the importance of a subject which is 
only just coming to its own in our educational pro- 
grammes. The work has two sections, the first being on 
" The Study and Teaching of History," and the second 
on " The Course of Study." The second part, in par- 
ticular, is full of direct practical usefulness to the 
teacher on account of its syllabi and its bibliographies. 
We can commend this work very highly. 



" Some of the Rhymes of Ironquill," a volume con- 
siderably expanded from earlier editions, but still lead- 
ing off with the ridiculous doggerel of " The Washer- 
woman's Song," is published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. These rhymes, as is now generally known, are 
the product of Mr. Eugene F. Ware, of Topeka, whose 
recent appointment to a federal position by President 
Roosevelt was probably meant in good faith to be an 
official recognition of American literature, and will 
doubtless add not a little to the vogue of the rhyme- 
ster. Although these efforts have, in fact, no relation 
whatever to literature, they constitute an entertaining 
sort of grimly humorous journalism, and our only 
quarrel with them is that innocent readers here and 
there may take them to be a form of poetry. 

Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith is, it seems, already an 
" author " in the sense of attaining to a standard 
library edition of his complete writings. It is a sub- 
scription edition, in ten volumes, styled the " Beacon," 
(which befits a " maker " who alternates between light- 
house and literature), and is published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. There are illustrations in 
color, a portrait, and several stories hitherto unpub- 
lished in book form. " Caleb West," " Laguerre's and 
Well- Worn Roads," " Colonel Carter," and " A White 
Umbrella in Mexico " are the four volumes now at 
hand, and the other six will follow in rapid succession. 

Dr. Willard Clark Gore is the author of a mono- 
graph on " The Imagination in Spinoza and Hume," 
published in the " University of Chicago Contributions 
to Philosophy." The object of the work, says the 
writer, " is to make a specific test, or at least to find 
an illustration, of the general proposition that philoso- 
phy, or metaphysics, and psychology form a logical 
partnership, or organic unity, which cannot be ignored 
or dissolved without impairing interests that each holds 
to be peculiarly its own." The interest of this theme, 
combined with Mr. Gore's attractive and lucid hand- 
ling, makes the study one of much value. 

Mr. Edwyn Robert Bevar is the latest of translators 
to attempt the " Prometheus Bound " of .31schylus, and 
his version appears in a simply sumptuous octavo, with 
wide margins, from the press of Messrs. Ballantyne, 
Hanson & Co., with the publisher's imprint of Mr. 
David Nutt. The translator contributes a brief preface 
and a lengthy introduction. In the former he explains 
that the Elizabethan drama, the English Bible, and 
the Miltonic epic have been, in a sense, the models for 
his guidance — truly a wise and well-considered choice. 
Certainly he has produced a vigorous and dignified 
version of " the most sublime poem in the world " — a 
version that will at least compare favorably with any 
of its rivals. 

" The Ancestor," a new periodical publication of 
English origin, for which the Messrs. Lippincott are 
the American agents, starts out with an issue dated 
April, to be a quarterly review; but the single number 
is in fact a handsome volume of large octavo size, 
bound in substantial boards. Considering the illustra- 
tions and the well-nigh sumptuous character of the 
paper and print, the price of a dollar and a half per 
part is surprisingly moderate. Among the contrib- 
utors, most of whom are titled, the name of Mr. J. 
Horace Round figures no less than four times in the 
first table of contents, which promises well for the his- 
torical scholarship of the undertaking. Upwards of a 
score of full-page plates, besides others in the text, 
constitute the illustrations of this volume.

" A Mannal of Instruction in the Principles of 
Prompt Aid to the Injured," by Dr. Alvmh H. Doty, is 
now published in its fourth revised edition by the 
Messrs. Appleton. 

Mr. Edward Atherton has edited for "Appletons' 
Home Reading Books " a summary of *' The Adven- 
tures of Marco Polo," with comments pertinent and 
otherwise, and illustrations. 

"Meteorite Studies," by Mr. Olirer Cnmmings Far- 
rington, and " A Contribution to the Ichthyology of 
Mexico," by Mr. Seth Eugene Meek, are recent pub- 
lications of the Field Columbian Museum. 

" Jack Sheppard " and " Rookwood," each in two vol- 
umes, and "Flitch of Bacon," in one, are recent addi- 
tions to the "Windsor" edition of W. H. Ainsworth's 
novels, published by the J. B. Lippineott Co. 

"Eiekiel," edited by Dr. O. C. Whitehouse, and 
"Jeremiah" and "Lamentations," edited by Mr. E. 
Tyrell Green, are the latest volumes of the " Temple 
Bible," published by the J. B. Lippineott Co. 

"Hymns of the Faith" is the English title given by 
Mr. Albert J. Edmunds to his translation of the "Dham- 
mapada," made from the Pali dialect of Sanskrit, and 
now published by the Open Court Publishing Co. 

Preprints from the forthcoming "Decennial Publi- 
cations of the L'niversity of Chicago " are coming to 
us every few days. The latest of them is a masterly 
study of " Credit," by Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, 
a quarto pamphlet of twenty-eight pages. 

A revised edition of Messrs. Herriek and Damon's 
"Composition and Rhetoric for Schools " has just been 
published by Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. The mod- 
ifications are in the direction of simplification, but the 
substance of the earlier edition remains intact. 

An important novel dealing with the careers of Lewis 
and Clark, and their great expedition, will be published 
in November by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. Neither 
author nor title has yet been announced, but the work 
is understood to be from the pen of a well-known writer 

From the Library of Congress we have a useful 
" List of References on Reciprocity," compiled by Mr. 
A. P. C. Griffin. Books, periodical references, and con- 
gressional documents upon the subject are catalogued 
in three lists, and the whole is supplemented by an 
index of authors. 

"Harold's Discussions" is the fifth volume of the 
"Nature-Study Readers" prepared by Mr. J. W. 
Troeger and Miss Edna Beatrice Troeger, and pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Appleton. The chapters are 
concerned with elementary geology, physiography, 
astronomy, and biology. The presentation of the mat- 
ter is simple and attractive. 

The American Book Co. are the publishers of a new 
set of school geographies, two in number, which are 
the work of Mr. H. Justin Roddy. They are, respec- 
tively, " ElemenUry " and " Complete," and aim at a 
more simplified treatment of the subject than is found 
in most school books upon this subject. 

"Schiller's Einfluss auf Grillparzer, by Mr. O. E. 
Lessing, and "The Time ElemenU of the Orestean 
Trilogy," by Mr. Jonathan Bayley Browder, are two 
additions to the " Philology and Literature Series " of 
the University of Wisconsin. Both are doctoral dis- 
sertations, and both are creditable to their authors and 
to the institution whence they proceed. 



The popularity still enjoyed by the Rev. S. Baring- 
Gould's " Vicar of Morwenatow " is attested by an 
" eighth edition " (Whittaker). Aside from the pleas- 
ing features of the book, its value as a biography 
can perhaps be estimated by striking a mean between 
the high praise with which the "Saturday Review" 
greeted its first appearance, and the scathing condem- 
nation it met with from "The Athenasum." 

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. publish "The Home 
Aquarium," by Mr. Eugene Smith. This book gives 
simple praetical directions for keeping the common 
fauna and flora of our lakes and streams, as well as for 
the determination of their species. For those whose 
ambition rises above a globe of goldfish it is just the 
book needed. 

Professor Earle W. Dow has made a translation, 
which is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., of 
the chapter on " The Feudal Regime " in the " Histoire 
G^n^rale " of MM. Lavisse and Rambeand. This chap- 
ter is the work of Professor Charles Seig^oboe, and in 
nowise suffers from its present detachment. 

Mr. William Frederick Harvey has translated from 
the Danish, and Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. have pub- 
lished, the learned treatise of Dr. Christopher Nyrop 
npon "The Kiss and its History." It is an instructive 
book, and also an entertaining one, prefaced by a warn- 
ing " as to the danger of even reading about kisses," 
which is not likely, we fancy, to make any reader close 
the volume for fear of being led astray. 

We are indebted to a correspondent in Japan, Mr. 
E. W. Clement, for the following interesting paragraph: 
" It is generally supposed that languages, like poets, 
are ' born, not made '; and that the changes in a lan- 
guage come, not artificially, but naturally. But we are 
now treated to the spectacle of an attempt to effect a 
tremendous reform in a language, many centuries old, 
by legislative enactment. And the nation which is 
making this apparently foolish and useless attempt is 
Japan, which has already often startled the world by 
its marvellous reforms. And if its wonderful success 
in legislative reforms in other lines are any criterion in 
this case, it will succeed in effecting much-needed re- 
form in its language. At the last session of the Imperial 
Diet of Japan, a sum of money was appropriated for a 
' linguistic commission.' This was appointed in the 
spriug of this year, has held several meetings, and has 
already arrived at some decisions. It has been decided, 
for instance, that ' a phonographic script ' is to be em- 
ployed; but the much discussed question, whether it 
shall be the common Japanese kana (syllabic charac- 
ters) or Roman letters is still on the docket. It is also 
proposed to reduce the number of Chinese idiographs 
in common use. Moreover, the difference* between the 
written and the spoken language are to be abolished; 
and the formal epistolary style is to be reformed. It 
has also been decided that the whole system of Japanese 
etymology must be ' carefully revised.' Even the 
'problem of local dialects' is to be attacked, and 'a 
standard dialect fixed.' It is noticeable that the com- 
mission is not afflicted with trepidity, but is proceeding 
with the utmost courage to attack the most difficult 
problems. It is composed of some of the most practical, 
as well as the most scholarly, men of the Empire; and 
its work will be watched with the deepest interest, both 
at home and abroad. And the great changes already 
effected in the Japanese language since the country was 
opened are some warrant for believing that this com- 
mission will achieve a measure of snooess."

the oldest two provinces of China. It is essentially a story 
of untravelled roads over which very few white men have 
ever ventured. Two chapters are devoted to an account 
of the recent exile of the Empress Dowager and Emperor 
in Sian while Pekin was in possession of the allied armies.

THE EXPEDITION OF LEWIS AND CLARK 

Reprinted from the Edition of 1814. With Introduction and Index by James K. 
HosMER, LL.D. With new photogravure portraits and facsimile maps. In two vols., 
square 8vo, about iioo pages, gilt tops, $5.00 net; delivered, $5.34. 

The appearance of this new edition is an event of much importance, especially when it is 
realized that no handy, popular edition of this classic has been available for years. In every way 
this reprint has been prepared to exactly fill this need, and it will undoubtedly take its rightful place 
as the standard library edition of Lewis and Clark. Dr. James K. Hosmer, the editor, is the author 
of several authoritative works in Western history, and President of the American Library Association. 
The text of the edition of 1814 has been used, and Dr. Hosmer has supplied an admirable intro- 
duction and a copious index. (Ready October 15.) 

BIRDS OF THE ROCKIES 

By Leander S. Keyser, author of " In Birdland," etc. With eight full-page plates 
(four in color) by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, many illustrations in the text by Bruce 
Horsfall, and eight views of localities from photographs. Square 8vo, $3.00 net ; 
delivered, $3.20. 

This is without doubt one of the most beautiful volumes ever oflered to Nature lovers. The 
recognized eminence of both author and artists in this particular field has naturally called for the 
highest perfection in printing, binding, and color work, and the result is a book of remarkable 
interest and distinction, and of the most sumptuous appearance. In addition to the general interest 
of Dr. Keyset's book, and its desirability as a gift book, it is especially important because there is 
no other work dealing specifically with the birds of the region described. (Ready September 27.) 

IN ARGOLIS 

An Account of a Summer in Greece. By George Horton. With an Introduction by 
Dr. Eben Alexander, late U. S. Minister to Greece. Illustrated from original photo- 
graphs. Printed at the Merrymount Press, i2mo, $1.75 net ; delivered, $1.87. 

Mr. Horton has written a really charming account of family life in a rural part of Greece. He 
has an unfailing eye for the picturesque as well as the humorous, and a knack of description of the 
most entertaining kind, tempered with an admirable sense of literary fitness. The appearance of 
the Volume as to typography and binding, is along lines of quiet elegance and irreproachable taste. 
(Ready September 20.) 

MEMORIES

(forty-fifth thousand), from new plates, with eight full-page illustrations by Blanche 
Ostertag. Square 8vo, deckle edge, $2.00 net; delivered, #2. 12. 

The thousands of readers of this idyllic little masterpiece, especially those who appreciate the 
unusual opportunity offered to the illustrator, will welcome this Holiday Edition. The full-page 
illustrations are drawn in charcoal and interpret perfectly the beautiful serenity of the story. 
Appropriate initials stand at the head of every chapter, and other decorations are used sparingly 
and with admirable taste. This artistic completeness is matched by beautiful typography, wide 
margins, and a general air of literary elegance. (Ready September 20.)

"Nero, the Artist," "The First Opera," " The Musical Small-Coals Man," "The First American 
Composer," etc. This is Mr. Upton's first book in many years, and will be welcomed by his thous- 
ands of friends and readers. The volume is illustrated with reproductions from rare wood engrav- 
ings, and is beautifully printed and bound. (Ready September 13.) 

THE STANDARD LIGHT OPERAS 

A Handbook. By George P. Upton. i2mo, $1.20 w^/; delivered, $1.29. 

This is the fifth volume in Mr. Upton's admirable series devoted to " The Standard Operas," 
" The Standard Symphonies," etc., and is uniform in style and treatment with its predecessors. 
He describes in detail the plots and music of the best examples of light opera of the French and 
German schools, the famous Gilbert and Sullivan series, and the productions of the modern musical 
comedy class. (Ready September 13.) 

SOCIALISM AND LABOR, and other arguments 

By the Rt. Rev. J. L. Spalding, Bishop of Peoria, author of " Religion, Agnosticism, 
and Education," etc. i6mo, 80 cents net ; delivered, 87 cents. 

This volume contains sixteen essays along the general lines indicated by the title. Bishop 
Spalding's previous volumes have generally dealt with religion and education, but of late years he 
has been giving much thought and attention to labor matters, and has spoken frequently in public 
on the subject. Several of these lectures are included in this new volume, and like all of the 
Bishop's writings, are notable for their balance, admirable clearness, and excellent style. There is 
no more able theorist on the vital questions of the moment than Bishop Spalding and whatever he 
has to say is always to the point and always interesting. (Ready in November.) 

VARIOUS VIEWS 

By William Morton Payne. Printed on thin Bible paper. iSmo, flexible cloth, 
$1.00 net; delivered, $1.08. 

Mr. Payne's new book of essays on literature and education is uniform with his previous books 
in character of contents, arrangement, and typography and binding. The judgment and style shown 
in his previous books have placed Mr. Payne beyond question among the first of living essayists. 
In fact, it is doubtful whether any man in this country has a wider or more exact knowledge of the 
progress and development of literary affairs. The quality of pertinency in Mr. Payne's essays is 
especially marked, and it is his disposition to deal with the tendency of the hour — the journalistic 
feature — that makes them of especial usefulness to students of American literature. (Ready 
in October.) 

CATCHWORDS OF CHEER 

Helpful Thoughts for Each Day of the Year. A compilation by Sara A. Hubbard. 
Printed at the Merrymount Press. 24mo, 80 cents net ; delivered, 88 cents. 

Mrs. Hubbard has given much thought and study to literature and the philosophy of life, and 
this little book is an epitome of her views on the latter subject. Her philosophy glows with optimism 
and she believes in consistently looking ^t the brighter side of life. For years she has collected from 
the great thinkers and poets aphorisms exemplifying her theory, and in her book these appear as 
" helpful thoughts for each day in the year." It is uniform with " Right Reading" and " Helpful 
Thoughts from Marcus Aurelius," two useful little volumes published last Spring. (Ready 
September 6.)

A. C. MCCLURG & CO.'S FAL L PUBLICATIONS — CONTINUED 

THE CONQUEST 

Being the True Story of Lewis and Clark. By Eva Emery Dye. With Frontispiece. 
i2mo, $1.50. 

Mrs. Dye here presents in vivid form the wonderful story of the most romantic event in 
American history. Though told as a romance, interesting the reader from beginning to end, no 
character is included, nor event depicted, not historically real or accurate. The author's researches 
have covered every original source where new light might be discovered, and the marvelous tale is pre- 
sented with a freshness and virility which must give the work a high place. (Ready in November.) 

ON FORTUNE'S ROAD 

By Will Payne. With eight full-page drawings by Thomas Fogarty. i2mo, $1.50. 
Mr. Payne has already written three successful books — "Jerry the Dreamer," "The Money 
Captain," and "The Story of Eva," — but this is his first collection of short stories. They deal 
with Chicago business life in its most strenuous form — big deals, big figures, and fortunes 
depending on a vote in the legislature. It is realism of the most brilliant kind, and yet there is as 
much romance and excitement in this kind of life as in the old days of chivalry. The reader 
enjoys it all the more because it is familiar. The titles of the stories are as follows : ' In the 
Panic," "A Day in Wheat," "The Plant at High Grove," "The Chairman's Politics," "The 
Lame Boy," "The Salt Crowd's Trade," "The End of the Deal." Mr. Fogarty's pictures are 
as telling and effective as are Mr. Payne's stories. (Ready September 13.) 

THE HOLLAND WOLVES 

A Historical Novel. By J. Breckenridge Ellis. With six full-page illustrations by 
the Kinneys. i2mo, $1.50. 

This is the story of one Belle-Isle, a Frenck soldier of fortune, and his adventures in the 
Netherlands during the dark days of the Spanish invasion. The "Holland Wolves" are two 
Dutch patriots whose ferocious deeds win for them their terrible soubriquet. There is plenty 
of fighting and mystery and all the other elements that go to make up a vigorous, exciting 
romance. The story is well conceived and dramatically worked out, and the illustrations by the 
Kinneys are quite as good as the text. These are the artists who made the now famous illustra- 
tions for "The Thrall of Leif the Lucky," and their drawings for this book are remarkable for 
spirited action and historical correctness. (Ready September 20.) 

A CAPTIVE OF THE ROMAN EAGLES 

By Felix Dahn. Translated from the German by Mary J. Safford. i2mo, $1.50. 

Like Georg Ebers, Felix Dahn has based his historical novels upon the solid foundation of 
earnest study. His chosen field is principally the period of the conflicts between Germany and 
Rome, and this novel is perhaps his best. It is intensely interesting without recourse to any 
superficial dramatic effects, and the narrative moves with dignity and power. The " Captive " is 
a beautiful Teutonic maiden who is captured by the Romans during one of their invasions, but 
makes her escape when her masters are defeated by the avenging Germans. The battle which 
forms a climax is described with extraordinary vividness. (Ready September 13.) 

THE BRIDGE OF THE GODS 

By F, H. Balch. New illustrated edition with eight full-page drawings by L. Maynard 
Dixon. i2mo, $1.50. 

Encouraged by the steady demand for Mr. Balch's fine romance, the publishers have issued 
an attractive new edition (the seventh) embellished with notable drawings by Mr. Laurens 
Maynard Dixon. This tale of Oregon in the seventeenth century has fairly earned its lasting 
popularity, not only by the intense interest of the story, but by its faithful delineation of Indian 
character. Mr. Dixon's work on the illustrations is remarkable for its strength and realism, and 
for his perfect understanding of the type he portrays. (Ready.)

THE PETE AND POLLY STORIES 

A Book of Nonsense Prose and Verse. By Carolyn Wells. Illustrated by Fanny 
Young Cor)'. Large 8vo, $1.50 net ; delivered, $1.68. 

No writer of books for young people is more adept at the clever nonsense demanded by modem 
children than Miss Wells ; and certainly there is no more popular anist among the same exacting 
critics than Miss Con\ In "The Pete and Polly Stories" two very engaging children have a 
series of astonishing adventures in strange places and with strange companions. The illustrations 
are equally whimsical and diverting, and altogether the book is one to allure the youngsters — and 
not improbably the oldsters also. (Ready October i.) 

LITTLE MISTRESS GOOD HOPE 

And Other Fairy Tales. By M.\RY Iml.^y T.aylor. With illustrations in color by 
Jessie Willcox Smith. Square i2mo, $1.50 net ; delivered, $1.62. 

Miss Taylor's reputation has been established by her series of successful historical novels, but 
she now makes a decided departure by bringing out a book of fairy stories. They are largely derived 
from English sources, and are written with all the story-teller's skill. The book is further distin- 
guished by the charming pictures by Miss Smith, who belongs to a coterie of artists now making 
themselves famous by their drawings of children. Her work is notable for its imagination, tech- 
nique, and beauty of color. (Ready September 27.) 

PRINCE SILVERWINGS 

Seven Fairy Tales. By Edith Ogden Harrison (Mrs. Carter H. Harrison). With 
full-page plates in color and text illustrations by Lucy Fitch Perkins. 4to, fi.75 net ; 
delivered, $1.95. 

Mrs. Harrison is the wife of the well-known mayor of Chicago, and makes her literarA' debut 
in this very attractive volume. There are seven stories in the book, and they are told in a singularly 
direct and unaffected manner, with the engaging simplicity that is so appreciated by young readers. 
The pictures are reproduced from water-color drawings in very delicate tints, and are charming both in 
conception and treatment. The tj-pe used is a large clear face, and this feature, together wnth the char- 
acter of the stories, makes the book especially desirable for younger children. (Ready October 11.) 

COQUO AND THE KING'S CHILDREN 

A Fairy Tale. By Corneli.a Baker. With six illustrations in color by Lucy Fitch 
Perkins. Small 4to, Si. 50 net ; delivered, $1.63. 

Coquo is the king's jester, and one of the most entertaining characters imaginable for children. 
He is the guide and counselor of the high-spirited little prince and princess — "the king's children," — 
and together they have some surprising adventures. The three discover a lovely little fairy in the 
woods, whom they take home and make one of the family — the little sprite gradually taking on the 
form and size of ordinary mortals. The pictures are most unusual in their cleverness and beautj'. 
(Ready October 8.) 

MAYKEN 

A Historical Story of Holland for Children. By Jessie Anderson Chase. With 
five full-page illustrations by the Kinneys. Small 4to, $1.20 net ; delivered, $1.33. 

" Mayken " has been brought out as a companion volume to " Margot," one of the most 
successful historical stories for children ever published. In make-up and general appearance the 
two books are practically uniform, and there is a similarity in their central idea, — the exciting life 
of a very youthful heroine in a stirring period of history-. The Spanish subjugation of the Nether- 
lands is the background for the story of little Mayken's adventures, and the young readers who 
were absorbed in " Margot " can safely take up this new romance. (Ready September 27.)

A Xlllth Century Allegory 
Translated and Edited by 
iMONTGOMERY CARMICHAEL 

""THE LADY POVERTY" is a medieval 
^ romance, simple in form and charming in 
conception, telling how St. Francis wooed and 
won that most difficult of all Brides — my Lady 
Poverty. Apart from its beauty it is noteworthy 
as the first book written concerning St. Francis 
of Assisi, having been completed within a year 
after the Saint's death (a.d. 1227). The little 
volume here offered is the first English translation, 
and faithfully enshrines the spirit of the original. 
The volume opens with a bibliographical in- 
troduction by the translator, and closes with an 
extract from the Xlth canto of Dante's " Para- 
dise " relating to the Allegory.

THE Novel This Fall 

THE CLIMAX 

Or, WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

By CHARLES FELTON PIDGIN 

Author of "QUINCY ADAMS SAWYER" and " BLENN ERH ASSETT " 

\X/HATEV£R you do, please disabuse your tjtoughts of any idea that this is an historical novel. The 
* * author has made a charming romance out of what might have happened to this country, and its people, 
if Burr had been elected governor of New York when he aspired to that office. Mr. Pidgin starts his story 
at this period, elects him governor, and then President. In the latter office Burr brings about important 
changes in our Constitution. An entirely different Aaron Burr from the one histories describe is the central 
figure of the story. The author has a fanciful conception of Aaron Burr as President-General of the United 
States. He is ever on the march, seeking to conqaer. If he decides that England, Spain, or France has 
some territory the United States should possess he takes his army out and gets it. Everything he does is 
for love of country. He is the people's idol. A love adventure is of the same importance to him as an 
affair of state, and he slights neither. By 1850 Aaron Burr has created an Utopian America — in the 
romance. It is a brisk romance of what never happened to Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas 
Jefferson, and many others of the period.

APPLETONS' FALL PUBLICATIONS 



LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN. 

Edited by Francis Dabwin. Two volomes, 500 pages each, cloth. 

There ought to be wide interest in these new letters by Darwin. Darwin's " Life and Letters" appeared 
many years ago, but a considerable mass of other correspondence has been brought to light, and the pubUshets 
expect to hare the book ready in ample season for the fall trade. Everything that Darwin wrote bore the 
impress of his sincere and gentle spirit. Eren his most learned treatises disclosed the man as very charming. 
In these letters readers are sure to meet with that attractive personality whieh no one that ever came under its 
spell can forget. 

THE WORK OF WALL STREET. 

By Sereno S. Pratt. (The first volame in Appletons' Basiness Series.) 12mo, cloth. 

The first volume in Appletons' Business Series will be " The Work of Wall Street," by Sereno S. Pratt. It 
deals with conditions as they exist to-day, and is based on personal knowledge. What is more, its author has 
realized what are the things worth telling, and has known how to present them in an orderly and understandable 
way. The book has twenty-thr«e chapters, and deals with about everything in which the general reader may be 
supposed to have an interest. It is believed that this book will win a place in popular literature such as no 
existing publication oo the subject makes any serious attempt to do.

SOME INTERESTING FICTION 



THE SPENDERS 

20th THOUSAND 

By Harry Leon Wilson. Six Illustrations by O'Neill Latham. Price, $1.50. 

A clear, strong, quick-moving novel. A genuine American story of a family that comes 
out of the West, with all the West's breeziness, independence, humor, and sturdy democracv, — 
the cardinal native traits. A really great piece of contemporaneous fiction. 



DOROTHY SOUTH 

32d THOUSAND 
By George Gary Eggleston, author of " A Carolina Cavalier." Six Illustrations by 

C. D. Williams. Price, $1.50. 
BOOK NEWS FOR MAY says : 

" In ' Dorothy South ' Mr. Eggleston has created a simple and beautiful romance, full of 
nobility and of all the finer emotions, with just a slight scattering of sage but smiling philos- 
ophy, intercepted by touches here and there of sparkling wit. No such woman character as 
Dorothy has appeared in fiction for many a long day." 



EAGLE BLOOD 

By James Creelman, author of " On the Great Highway." Illustrated by 
Rose Cecil O'Neill. Price, ;$i.50. 
This is Mr. Creelman's great novel, although as a brilliant writer he is well known 
throughout the world. His story introduces an Englishman of noble family, who comes to 
America for the purpose of making his way, not by a marriage for money, but by commercial 
opportunities. The work is one of great psychological intensity, full of action, tender in 
its love motif, and world-interesting in its popular discussion of commercialism. 



RICHARD GORDON 

By Ale.xander Black. Six Illustrations by Ernest Fuhr. Price, $1.50. 
This is one of the strongest novels of the day. The scenes are laid in upper New York 
society, with a dash into Bohemia that is refreshing and vivid. The hero is manlv and virile. 
The heroine is charming, lovable, thoroughly womanly, and essentially feminine. It sparkles 
with delicious humor and fetching repartee. 



THE MILLIONAIRESS 

By Julian Ralph. Six Illustrations by C. F. Underwood. Price, $1.50. 
A striking story of New York social life among carriage people. It has a charming 
heroine, who occupies the centre of the stage in some brilliant scenes. It shows that a 
woman of fashion and an heiress can keep unspoiled her sweetness and sincerity of nature.

AN'NOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... U59 
(A claasfied list of books announced for publication 
dorii^ the eoming Fall and Winter aeaaon.) 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

In making these few random notes upon 
the lists of publishers' announcements for the 
season now opening, we are compelled to ex- 
dude many important categories altogether, 
and to confine our attention to the books that 
have some relation to literature in the narrower 
sense — that is, to books which contain litera- 
ture or are concerned with literary history and 
criticism, with an occasional excursion into the 
allied realms of history and biography. Even 
with this restriction, we must be confined to the 
mention of a very few names and titles, delib- 
erately ignoring many others that are perhaps 
no less important than those singled out for 
comment. The book of the year, if we mean 
by that expression the book that will attract 
the widest attention and be made the subject 
of the most extensive discussion, is pretty likely 
to be Mr. Morley's long-awaited biogfraphy of 
Gladstone. It is fortunate for Gladstone's 
memory that Mr. Morley should have been 
chosen for his biog^pher, and we are sure that 
the author will do all that literary art can ac- 
complish to make of Gladstone's figure a living 
personality for the coming generations. Other- 
wise, Gladstone would be in danger of becom- 
ing little more than the shadow of a name for 
the general reader of the twentieth century. 
He could not be ignored by the historian, but 
he could easily be forgotten by the great read- 
ing public. All that he has left b«hind him 
in the way of published speeches and miscel- 
laneous writings is so nearly unreadable, and 
so utterably inadequate to convey any notion 
of the power that impressed itself upon his 
contemporaries that, in default of a great biog- 
raphy, his fame would be in danger of eclipse 
within a very few years. We have no doubt 
that Mr. Morley has produced a great biog- 
raphy, sympathetic and thoroughly-informed; 
we have no means of foretelling whether it will 
be finally ranked with his Cobden, or with his 
trio of French biographical studies. Those who 
cherish Gladstone's memory will devoutly hope 
that the latter will be its fate. Xow that Mr. 
Morley has got into the way of writing ag^in, 
may we not express a parenthetic wish that the 
series of " Twelve English Statesmen " may be 



152 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



made twelve in number no less than in name 
by the early addition of the life of Chatham 
that Mr. Morley agreed to write when the 
series was first projected many years ago. 

If Mr. Morley remains in any active sense 
the editor of the " English Men of Letters " 
series he is to be congratulated upon the new 
lease of life recently taken by that enterprise. 
Three new volumes of the series have already 
been published, and are reviewed in our present 
issne ; no less than eleven others are now 
announced as in preparation. The choice of 
biographers has in every case that peculiar ele- 
ment of fitness which has always distinguished 
this series of books above all others with which 
comparisons might be made. Hitherto Haw- 
thorne has been the sole American representa- 
tive of English literature in the series, but of 
the new volumes projected no less than four 
are to have American subjects. We note in 
this connection that the series of " American 
Men of Letters," which has, like its English 
prototype, been neglected for many years, is 
now to be extended by the addition of several 
new volumes. 

While upon the subject of literary and other 
biography, we may record a number of prom- 
ised books that may be anticipated with much 
satisfaction. The Kev. Edward Everett Hale's 
" Memories of a Hundred Years " has already 
appeared in serial instalments, but we shall 
be glad to have it published in permanent 
form. An authorized biography of Bret Harte 
has been prepared by Mr. T. Edgar Pember- 
ton, and cannot well fail to prove interesting. 
The elaborate biography of Christopher Col- 
umbus upon which Mr. John Boyd Thacher 
has been working for many years promises to 
be one of the most sumptuous publications of 
the season. The devotion of a son, in the one 
case, and of the widow in the other, will pro- 
vide us, respectively, with two volumes of the 
letters of Charles Darwin, and a two-volume 
life of Max Miiller. Sir Leslie Stephen's 
two-volume work, " Studies of a Biographer," 
will have many subjects, and will illustrate 
once more the author's singularly happy and 
incisive method of literary portraiture. The 
recent Dumas centenary has called attention 
to the fact that we have in English no life of 
the novelist better than Fitzgerald's hack com- 
pilation, a defect which now promises to be 
remedied by the appearance of two new biog- 
raphies, the work, respectively, of Mr. Henry 
A. Spurr and Mr. Arthur F. Davidson. 



Probably the most important historical an- 
nouncement of the season is that the first of 
the twelve projected volumes of " The Cam- 
bridge Modern History " is ready for publica- 
tion. Although the death of Lord Acton has 
made necessary the appointment of a new 
editor (Mr. A. W. Ward), the work will be 
continued upon the original plans, and the 
volumes may be expected in fairly rapid suc- 
cession. " The Renaissance " is the title of 
the initial volume of the series. In this con- 
nection we may mention the two volumes of 
Lord Acton's " Historical Lectures '" that are 
soon to appear. The late John Fiske will be 
represented this year by three posthumous 
volumes. Two of the three are "Essays His- 
torical and Literary," and the third is " New 
France and New England," which will fill the 
gap in the American series, and provide a 
continuous history of our country from the 
discovery to the beginning of the constitu- 
tional period. Another work of great impor- 
tance in this field is the illustrated " History 
of the American People " upon which Presi- 
dent Woodrow Wilson has long been engaged, 
and which will soon be in our hands. It will 
occupy five large volumes, and will supply a 
a real want. 

The most important announcement in the 
field of literary history is the new "Illustrated 
History of English literature" upon which 
Mr. Richard Garnett and Mr. Edmund Gosse 
have for some time been engaged. The work 
will fill four large volumes, and represents a 
type of history which has long been familiar 
in the principal European countries, but which 
for some strange reason has not hitherto been 
attempted for our own literature. The series 
of " Literatures of the World " is to have two 
additions this season. Dr. Brandes will pub- 
lish his history of modern Scandinavian liter- 
ature, and no man living is better qualified for 
this undertaking. For the American litera- 
ture in the same series the services of Profes- 
sor William P. Trent have been enlisted, 
which is also a happy choice. Mr. Trent is 
likely to write as good a book as that which 
we owe to Professor Wendell, and it will 
doubtless be free from those qualities which 
have made the latter work irritating to a cer- 
tain class of readers. A history of German 
literature by Professor John G. Robertson is 
a work that we shall await with much interest. 
If the four new volumes in the Columbia 
University studies in literature shall prove as 



^ 



1902.]

acceptable as their predecessors, they will 
make an important addition to the student's 
outfit. Two works in Shakespearian criticism 
are promised in the shape of Professor Louns- 
bury's "Shakespeare and Voltaire" and the 
late Sidney Lanier's " Shakespeare and His 
Forerunners. " The former volume will be wel- 
come to those who are acquainted with M. 
Jusserand's treatment of the same subject, 
and the latter, to consist of Lanier's unpub- 
lished lectures, will add notably to the author's 
reputation. 

English poetry promises to be enriched by 
a new volume of Mr. Swinburne's poems and a 
collection of •' New Poems " by Mr. Theodore 
Watts-Dunton. Mr. Stephen Phillips is to 
have a fourth drama in verse, with " David 
and Bathsheba "' for its subject. The trans- 
lation of Sig. dAnnunzios " Francesca da 
Rimini," by Mr. Arthur Symons. will be a true 
English poem, a statement which can rarely be 
made concerning a work of verse-translation. 
We are glad also to note that Mr. William 
Vaughn Moody's " A Masque of Judgment " 
is to be reissued, and thus brought to the atten- 
tion of the wide circle that this extraordinary 
poem deserves to reach. As for works of 
fiction they are legion. We note a few of the 
manv titles, restricting the list to books bv 
well-known novelists. " No Other Way " is 
the title of a posthumous story by Sir Walter 
Besant. Other novels from across the Atlan- 
tic are '-The King's Byways,"' by Mr. Stanley 
J. Weyman : "The Vultures," by Mr. Henry 
Seton Merriman : and " Love with Honour," 
by Mr. Charles Marriott. Of American origin 
are the following : " Captain Macklin," by 
Mr. Richard Harding Davis: "Cecilia, the 
Last of the Vestals," by Mr. F. Marion Craw- 
ford : " The Fortunes of Oliver Horn," by 
Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith ; " The Wings of 
the Dove," by Mr. Henry James : " The 
Maid-at-Arms," by Mr. Robert W. Chambers; 
and *' Barbara Ladd," by Mr. C. G. D. Rob- 
erts. Two masters of the art of short-story 
writing, Mr. T. B. Aldrich and Mr. Henry 
Van Dyke, are to have new collections. Of 
foreign novelists, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin prom- 
ises to make us acquainted with a new Pole, 
Mr. Alexander Glovatski, his romance being 
called '• The Pharaoh and the Priest "; while 
the great German romancer, Herr Felix Dahn, 
will be reintroduced to our public by means of 
*' A Captive of the Roman Eagles," one of the 
finest of his later works. 



THE ACTOR AND THE MAN. 

Many readers of the late Phillips Brooks's biog- 
raphy mast have been surprised to discover that 
this man — go imaginative in his sympathies, so 
little ascetic in any way — had the old Paritanic 
distrnst of the theatre. Have as little to do with 
it as possible, be counsels ; and of the actor's pro- 
fession in particular, be believes it to be necessarily 
enervating to character. It is possible that Brooks 
had in mind the oatward temptations of stage-life — 
Shakespeare's " public means that pnblic manners 
breed." Bat on second thought one is inclined to 
believe that his criticism went deeper and struck at 
the very nature of an art. 

Curiously enough, M. Coqnelin, in his defense of 
the actor's profession before Harvard University, 
admits the force of snch a criticism. There is a 
social stigma attaching to the stage, says Coqaelin ; 
what is its cause ? With characteristic French sub- 
tlety, he makes no reference to the social dangers 
of stage-life. He assumes that the public is suspi- 
cious, not so much of them, as of the actor's art 
itself and its inSaence upon the man. It is the 
impersonator that it regards with instinctive dis- 
trnst. The actor upon the stage is not speaking 
for himself, he has simply borrowed the emotions 
of a part : and the belief persists that emotion thus 
constantly assumed, adopted in fact as a profession, 
is incompatible with self-respect, if not with sin- 
cerity. Brooks, no doubt, with others of insight, 
knew that as a matter of fact it might easily de- 
bauch the moral sense. 

Needless to say, Coquelin ref nted the criticism ; 
bat I question if any actor could make so serious a 
defence without himself feeling the force of the doubt 
that he dismisses. If we are to trust the record of 
a recent novelist, it is an actress whose "own self 
gave her pain, the mutability of her features, the 
strange mimic power possessed by the muscles of 
her face, the unconscious art that regulated the 
meaning of her gestures''; and Shakespeare's own 
passionate resentment of his profession reads like 
something more than mere disgust with stage asso- 
ciations : 
" Alas, 'tis trae I hsre ^ne here and there. 

And made mvself a motlej to the riew. 

Gored mine own tbooshta, sold cheap what ia most daw. 

Hade old offences of affections new ; 

Host tme it is that I hare look'd on tmtii 

Aakanee and strangely ; — " 

This trafficking in the emotions, which is the very 
soul of dramatic art — is there any artist who has 
lent himself to it again and again without once 
feeling gome loss of personal integrity, some pang 
of outraged manhood ? 

Yet surely this objection to the stage, if it is tme 
at all. must hold good for every use of the dramatic 
temperament, for all art where the artist is com- 
pelled to experiment in the emotions ; and as a mat- 
ter of fact, dramatists and novelists and poets have 



154 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



been perfectly well aware of the moral paradox in 
their own calling. Keats says of the " poetic char- 
acter," as he calls it, — having always in mind 
Shakespeare's genius with its vast susceptibility, — 
" It has no self. It is everything and nothing. . . . 
What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the 
chameleon poet ... It does no harm from its relish 
of the dark side of things any more than from its 
taste for the bright one, because they both end in 
speculation." Imaginative curiosity indulged for 
its own sake ! Is that condition of dramatic sym- 
pathy indeed so harmless to the man? The poet 
continues with this interesting bit of autobiog- 
raphy : " It is a wretched thing to confess ; but it 
is a very fact, that not one thing I ever utter can 
be taken for granted as an opinion growing out of 
my identical nature — how can it when I have no 
nature? When I am in a room with people, if I 
ever am free from speculating on creations of my 
own brain, then not myself goes home to myself, 
but the identity of every one in the room begins to 
press upon me, so that I am in a very little time 
annihilated." So then the most typical of poets 
is authority for the confession of a recent novelist, 
and Mr. Barrie's " Sentimental Tommy " is not 
the special instance that somehow the aggrieved 
reader felt like declaring it to be. The poetical 
character has no self. It is everything and nothing. 
Sincerity, as plain men and women know sincerity, 
is impossible to the artist. The passions of art are 
fictitious passions, and the reader is the dupe, if not 
of professional, at least of artistic sentimentality. 
Somehow it does not put us on better terms with 
the artist that he is himself included in the deception 
that he practises — that he is not a man, but just 
an emotional subject. For the moment we are 
almost reconciled to the passing of art altogether. 
For one need not be the worst of Philistines and 
yet instinctively distrust an enjoyment so little self- 
respecting in its origin, and ask with all serious- 
ness whether, if the success of the artist does indeed 
mean the death of character, art itself is worth the 
price. 

But the statement itself grows more and more 
questionable as we come to judge it by the history 
of normal art. Is it really the absence of character 
that serves the artist? Say that the first condition 
of his art is his impressionability, to which he yields 
himself at the expense of those convictions, those 
self-limitations which shape character. Yet, with- 
out convictions, an art has never been known to 
develop along healthy lines. It lacks precisely that 
constructive inspiration which separates sane art 
from our modern diseased impressionism — the im- 
pressionism of which d'Annunzio and his analysis 
of the artist-soul in " The Flame of Life " is a fla- 
grant example. Mere curiosity about life, the love 
of emotional and intellectual adventure for its own 
sake, is no doubt the first motive of the imaginative 
as opposed to the moral genius. But such an ex- 



perimental mood serves, though at first almost 
unconsciously, the understanding of life which 
later inevitably crystallizes into moral conviction. 
Keats himself is forced to this conclusion ; for 
although his art never had time to grow up, its 
serious manhood is foreshadowed in those wonder- 
ful letters of his. He sees how that versatile com- 
prehension, which is at first the sole aim of art, has 
the tremendous effect of " sharpening one's vision 
into the heart and nature of man — of convincing 
one's nerves that the world is full of misery and 
heart-break, pain, sickness and oppression." In 
other words, the normal artist finds himself grad- 
ually weaned from his first indifference and detach- 
ment. He begins to feel, as Keats quotes, " the bur- 
den of the mystery," and is forced to explore it on 
his own account. One can watch this deepening 
sincerity in the development of all sound genius. 
A slight but very genuine art, such as Stevenson's, 
bears witness to it. Of course Shakespeare is al- 
ways the typical example. If one should complain, 
for instance, of the "Midsummer-Night's Dream," 
that its author(to quote Emerson) is simply " Master 
of the Revels," and has no moral or personal stake 
in his own creation, one has but to open " Lear " 
to find oneself in the presence of intense moral 
sympathies and aversions through which a strong 
personality speaks. Evidently, in the development 
of an art, a man has been maturing, and steadily 
using the vicarious sympathies of the artist more 
and more in the service of conviction, of direct and 
personal passion. 

At any rate, M. Coquelin's plea for the dignity 
of the actor's profession rested just here. He in- 
sisted that the actor must never really abnegate his 
own personality. For to impersonate, one must 
also interpret ; and to interpret, the actor must 
preserve the critical vantage-point — the vantage- 
point of individual experience and intellectual con- 
viction. 

It is a fine point in criticism, which simply 
goes to prove that the intellectual attitude of the 
dramatist, if he is to aim at the best success, can- 
not really differ from that of other serious callings. 
Shakspeare defined in his maturity the mission of 
the stage, and incidentally, we may suppose, of his 
own art : " to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to 
nature ; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her 
own image, and the very age and body of the time 
his form and pressure." The most imaginative 
of men, the most subtle of natures ("just within 
the possibility of authorship," to quote Emerson 
again), he justifies his art by its simple moral 
purpose. Was it not precisely this simplicity of 
aim which kept Shakespeare's genius from the re- 
fined debauchery of what is sometimes pleased to 
call itself the " artistic " temperament ? The man 
was not the creature of his art. The art was ever 
increasingly the product of the man.

COMM UNIC A TION. 

IS "HAWTHORNE'S FIRST DIART" A FORGERY? 
(To the Editor of Thjs Dial.) 
Five years ago Hoaghton, Mifflin & Co. published 
for me a little volume with the title "Hawthorne's 
First Diary, with an Account of its Discovery and 
Loss." Nearly thirty years previous to this publica- 
tion, I was in correspondence with a mysterious per- 
son, whom, after his death in 1871, I found to be a 
mulatto named William Symmes, who was in the em- 
ploy of Col. Baker's detective bureau in Washington 
during the Civil War. When Hawthorne, then in his 
teens, was living with his mother in Raymond, Maine, 
this negro of about his age was living in an adjoining 
town, and they often hunted, fished, and skated 
together. In a letter sent to me in 1870, for publi- 
cation in a weekly paper with which I was then con- 
nected, Symmes asserted that from a Maine soldier 
hailing from Raymond, whom he nursed in a Virginia 

hospital, he obtained a little manuscript volume a 

sort of diary kept by Hawthorne when he was between 
twelve and sixteen years of age. I could not induce 
him to send me the book, but from time to time he 
copied some of the items from it, and I published them. 
Persons were mentioned in these items who were living 
when at last they were printed, and they testified to 
the accuracy with which events within their memory 
were recorded. The style of many of the passages was 
decidedly Hawthomesque. The mulatto refused to take 
any money for the articles he furnished, and persistently 
declined to send the manuscript book from which he 
alleged the items were copied. He promised when he 
next visited New England he would bring the book 
with him. He did not come to New England ; and died 
in Florida soon after making the promise. Much search 
has been made, but the mannscript has never been found. 
It most be confessed that a suspicions mystery en- 
veloped the whole affair, and yet the literary style and 
the corroboratory testimony of many persons mentioned 
in the alleged " Diary " inclined me to full belief in its 
authenticity. Hawthorne's mother and other relatives 
were constantly referred to precisely as he would be 
likely to speak of them, and there was a boyish tone in 
every paragraph that it would require genius ik any 
middle-aged man to assume. Is it imaginable that a 
comparatively illiterate and uncultured man could 
have composed this admirable inscription, alleged to 
have been written on the fly leaf of the « Diary " by 
Hawthorne's uncle, Richard Manning? 

" Praseated by Richard Manning, to his nephew Nathaniel 
Hathome («c), with the advice that he write ont his 
thon^hts, some every day, in as good words as he can, upon 
any and all subjects, as it is one of the beet means of his ae- 
eanag for matore yean, eomnumd of thon^t and language. 
"Raymond, June 1, 1816." 
One item tells of swapping knives with a Quaker 
lad named Robinson Cook. An aged Quaker of the 
name wrote to me at once that he well remembered 
this transaction. Many other items were similarly cor- 
roborated, so that for nearly thirty years I rested in 
the belief that the " Diary " was genuine in spite of 
the suspicious circumstances mentioned. New and 
very strong evidence to shake this belief has come to 
me within a few months. I have found that one of 
the items could not possibly have been written by 



Hawthorne, while it may have been forged by Symmes. 
A curious drowning incident is recorded, with the date 
missing, as in most of the other items. I have found 
that the story is true in all its details, bat it happened 
in 1828, years after Hawthorne left Raymond, and after 
he ceased to be the boy who pnrports to be writing. 
Symmes, however, was in that vicinity in 1828. Sm 
how cunningly be puts the story into Hawthorne's 
month, writing forty years after the event described: 

"A yonng man named Henry Jackson, Jr., was drowned 
twu days ago, np in Crooked River. He and one of his 
friends were trying which conld swim the faster. Jackson 
was behind bat gaining ; his friend kicked at him in fnn, 
thinking to hit bis shoolder and posh him back, bnt mined, 
and hit his chin, which cansed him to take in water and 
itiSBsle, aad before his friend conld help or get help, poor 
JadaoB was fElder Leach says) 'beyond the reach of 
meiey.' I read ont of the Fnlma to my mother this mom- 
iae, aad it plainly declares twenty^six times, that 'God's 
mcey aadnreth forever.' I never saw Henry Jackson, — he 
was a jotag man just married. Mother is sad ; says she 
shall not eoBMat to my swimming any more in the mill-poad, 
with the boys, fearing that in sport my month might (et 
kicked open, and then sorrow for a dead son be added to 
that for my dead father, which she says would break her 
heart. I love to swim, bat shall not disobey my mother." 

Let any one who reads this little story try to tell it 
in fewer or better chosen words, and he will not fail to 
notice that a master hand guided the pen. What 
could be neater than the criticism of Elder Leach's 
funeral sermon, and the mildly humorous turn in 
r^ard to his mother's misgivings? If Hawthorne 
wiote this paragraph it must have been when he was 
twenty-four years old, and this thought must be dis- 
missed. If Symmes wrote it, and I see no escape from 
this alternative, it was done when he was nearly seventy 
years of age, after a strenuous life as a cook on a sail- 
ing vessel, and as a spy upon spies during the civil war. 
It must have required the genius of a Chatterton to have 
foi^d that story in language so like what we may imag- 
ine young Hawthorne would use. And this is only one 
of many passages in which equal literary skill is shown. 
Some critics I have eoosulted are disposed to believe 
the bulk of the ■* Diary " is genuine, but that Symmes 
ventured upon interpolations. For my own part, I con- 
fess I am puzzled, and have lost hope of ever solving 
the mystery. The chapters of the book dealing with 
Hawthorne's life in the Maine wilderness, and telling 
the romantic story of the life of Symmes, are reliable, 
having been gathered from many authentic sources. 
Hawthorne's biographers have not g^ven bis life in 
Maine the number of years nor the importance that 
really belong to it. From the age of ten to the time 
of his graduation he spent a large part of each year 
in Raymond, which is in the same county as Brunswick, 
the seat of his college. The mulatto Symmes is known 
to have been his companion in boyish sports. The 
father of Symmes was a leader of the Maine bar a 
century ago, and he gave his illegitimate son his own 
name. For five generations his white ancestors were 
clergymen of note in England and New England, and 
two of them were martyrs in the Marian persecution. 
If Symmes was the forger, possibly we may account 
for his literary skill by sopposing he inherited it from 
a long line of cultured ancestors. He himself knew 
nothing of this ancestry, and did not even know how 
to spell his own name ! Sajiuel T. Pickard.

Three English Authors.* 



We are glad that a sketch of William Haz- 
litt has been included in the new series of 
"English Men of Letters," and the work of 
preparing it could hardly, on the whole, have 
fallen to better hands than those of Mr. 
Augustine Birrell. Kobert Louis Stevenson 
is the man who could have handled the subject 
almost ideally, and we understand that he 
once thought of undertaking it, but was de- 
terred by the repugnance which was caused 
him by the "Liber Amoris" episode. Hazlitt 
was the glorified journalist of English litera- 
ture, but, being essentially a journalist, his 
work was miscellaneous and fragmentary. As 
such, it does not command the continued in- 
terest of new generations of readers, and, 
although the student of literature and the lover 
of fine writing will always cherish Hazlitt's 
writings, they do not appeal to the larger mod- 
ern public. The new edition of his collected 
work now in course of publication will help to 
extend his leasehold in popular esteem, but 
even that will not avail to make a notable in- 
crease in his following. Such a sketch as Mr. 
Birrell has prepared, on the other hand, will 
make many persons acquainted with a writer 
who has hitherto been little more than a name 
to them, and will, besides recalling the annals 
of his career, give them a fair notion of his 
literary quality, for the author has wisely in- 
troduced many illustrative extracts, some of 
considerable length, and amounting altogether 
to about a third of the entire volume. And 
it would be strange if some few readers, at 
least, coming upon such a passage as the elo- 
quent characterization of Coleridge, should not 
at once take Hazlitt into their affections, and 
make further acquaintance with his works. 
Mr. Birrell deals discreetly with the varied 
career of this acute critic and confirmed senti- 
mentalist. Nothing extenuating, even in the 
case of Hazlitt's relations with his wives and 
other women, but setting down nought in mal- 
ice, Mr. Birrell draws a sympathetic portrait 
of a personality that repelled more than it at- 
tracted, but that won the esteem of many good 
men and the steadfast friendship of Charles

Lamb. An index adds materially to the use- 
fullness of this work, and we wish that the 
publishers could see their way to provide simi- 
lar apparatus for all the books of the series to 
which this belongs. 

The task of preparing an account of " George 
Eliot " for this series of critical and biographical 
studies has fallen into the hands of Sir Leslie 
Stephen, which means for the reader refined 
intellectual entertainment as well as the discus- 
sion of the novelist from a broader than the. 
merely literary point of view. Sir Leslie is not 
only the sanest of literary critics, but he is also 
a philosophical scholar peculiarly interested in 
the problems with which " George Eliot " was 
possibly too much preoccupied for her best in- 
terests as a novelist. He would be the last to 
deny that a novelist may properly have views 
upon serious subjects, and make use of fiction 
as a medium for their expression. " A novel- 
ist's facts can prove nothing, for the simple 
reason that they are fictions ; and his narra- 
tive when it is reasoning in disguise, becomes 
intolerable." This is undoubtedly true, and 
needs to be said ; but on the other hand, there 
is much pertinence in the questions that follow 
the above remark. 

" What is a poor novelist to do who happens to have 
been impressed by some of the great masters of thought, 
such as Plato or Spiuoza, whose philosophies are em- 
bodied poetry? Is he to forget all the thoughts that 
have occurred to him in his philosophical capacity, and 
to write as though he had no more speculations about 
the world or human nature than the most frivolous of 
his readers? If his philosophy has really modified his 
own microcosm, can he drop it when he describes the 
world? And why should he be called upon to drop it? 
Must he not, at any rate, have some tinge of psy- 
chology." 

The one who puts these questions is clearly in 
sympathy with the novelist's almost avowed 
purpose of teaching philosophy by example ; 
but he does not hesitate to note the failures or 
the imperfect successes of her method. The 
best of her novels, after all, are those in which 
her social philosophy is most implicit. "The 
Mill on the Floss " would probably be the best 
of them all were it not hopelessly marred 
by the closing section. The impossible Mr. 
Stephen Guest is too much for the critic, who 
sums up in these words the episode of his re- 
lations with Maggie : 

" We might even have forgiven her, if, after being a 
little overpowered by the dandified Stephen, she had 
shown some power of perceiving what a very poor 
animal he was. The affair jars upon us because it is 
not a development of her previous aspirations, but sud- 
denly throws a fresh and unpleasant light upon her 
character. . . . George Eliot did not herself under-

stand what a mere hair-dresser's block she was de- 
scribing in Mr. Stephen Guest. He is another instance 
of ber incapacity for portraying the opposite sex." 

Of the novelist's one excursion into the region 
of historical fiction, Sir L#eslie has a rather 
poor opinion ; but who can say that the follow- 
ing criticism is essentially unjust ? 
" When we take up a book in which one is to be a 
contemporarr with the Borgias, and to have personal 
interviews with Klachiavelli we may expect a similar 
sensation. We are to be spectators of a state of things 
in which the elementary human passions hare been let 
loose, when violence and treachery are normal parts of 
the day's work, when new intellectual horizons hare 
opened, and yet the old creeds are still potent, and 
there is the strangest mingling of high aspirations and 
bmtal indulgence, when the nobler and baser elements 
of belief are so strangely blended that the rufi&an is 
still religious, and the enlightened reformer fanatically 
superstitious. If anybody derives any vivid impression 
of such a world from ■ Romola ' his eyes most be much 
keener than mine." 

It so happens that a book published since this 
paragraph was written provides an apt illus- 
tration of Sir Leslie's comment. "The Resur- 
rection of the Gods,'* by the Russian Professor 
Merejkowski, deals with precisely the same 
period of history, and, although without one- 
half of the technical skill of the novelist which 
" Romola " displays, it does accomplish pre- 
cisely what we are told that such a work should 
accomplish. A more exact characterization 
of the Russian work could not be made than 
is contained in our quotation from Sir Leslie 
Stephen. When the author comes at last to 
the history and character of Daniel Deronda, 
he strikes fair game. If that blameless prig 
has not yet " gone the way of all waxworks," 
in Mr. Swinburne's phrase, he is pretty gen- 
erally recognized as the weakest of the novel- 
ist's creations, and we can sympathise with the 
sly fun that Sir Leslie delights to poke at him. 
His playful and delicious satire infuses the 
whole chapter devoted to this novel, but would 
evaporate if any attempt were made to illus- 
trate by quotations. 

For the " Matthew Arnold " volume in this 
series the services of Mr. Herbert Paul have 
been enlisted, — a choice that, on the whole, 
approves itself to the judicious. Mr. Paul 
has a pointed epigrammatic style that is almost 
brilliant, although there is about it a certain 
degree of dogmatic hardness. His sympathy 
with his subject is keen upon the literary side, 
but rather defective upon the philosophical 
side, although he is much more satisfactory 
than Mr. Saintsbury in the discussions of Ar- 
nolds theological and political writings. Be- 
ing a religious conservative as well as a Glad- 



stonian he oonld hardly be expected to forego 
a somewhat caustic criticism of Arnold's poli- 
tics and persuasive religious rationalism. He 
indulges in a good deal of rather minute liter- 
ary criticism — the sort that singles out lines 
and phrases for comment — and it is not al- 
ways well-advised. But of Arnold's value as 
a literary critic he has no doubt whatever. 
" Mr. Arnold did not merely criticise books 
himself. He taught others how to criticise 
them. He laid down principles, if he did not 
always keep the principles he laid down. No- 
body, after reading ' Essays in Criticism,' has 
any excuse for not being a critic." Even 
i more pronounced in its emphasis is a passage 
from the introduction. " Matthew Arnold may 
be said to have done for literature almost what 
Ruskin did for art. He reminded, or informed 
the British public that criticism was a serious 
thing : that good criticism was just as impor- 
tant as good authority : that it was not a 
question of individual taste, but partly of 
received authority, and partly of trained 
judgment." In a sense, Mr. Paul has had a 
comparatively easy task. With less than half 
a dozen books to consult for authority, he has 
simply set down the events in Arnold's life, and 
commented upon his writings in the order of 
their publication. This volume, like the 
" Hazlitt," is provided with an index, for 
which we are thankful.

The three most recent volumes in Scrib-

John W. Burgess. Two of these are devoted 
to the period from 1859 to 1865, under the 
title " The Civil War and the Constitution." 
This period is illustrated in two distinct as- 
pects : one, its military history, giving a con- 
densed and succinct account of the campaigns 
and engagements of the war; and the other, 
its constitutional history, with discussions of 
the questions then or since mooted, concerning 
the constitutional phases of the movements 
of the period. These two lines of study are

chronologically. Some readers would doubtless 
prefer a division of these subjects which would 
give each a volume by itself. The author's 
pages do not seem to exhibit any common vin- 
culum uniting the two. A final chapter of the 
second volume is devoted to a terse but clear 
and instructive resume of the international 
complications growing out of the war. The 
third volume closes with a chapter treating in 
a similar manner of the international relations 
of the United States between 1867 and 1877. 
The eminently valuable portion of this work 
is its constitutional history. The presentation 
of the important subjects of Secession, Eman- 
cipation, the National Powers of the Govern- 
ment, and the War Powers of the Executive in 
their constitutional relations, is profound and 
scholarly, and is seasoned with the author's 
well-known fearlessness and impartiality. The 
cause of Secession is shown to have been 
constitutionally and morally groundless ; con- 
stitutionally because the only real grievance 
of the secessionists was, that after March 4, 
1861, the legally elected and installed govern- 
ment of the United States would be in the con- 
trol of a party which would probably legislate 
contrary to the wishes of the secessionists, 
on subjects admittedly within the legislative 
power; and morally, because the secessionists 
had been offered compromises, liberal beyond 
reason, to induce them to abandon their at- 
tempted secession. Our author places fitting 
emphasis upon the willingness of the Repub- 
lican leaders in Congress to avoid war by 
supporting an irrepealable amendment to the 
Constitution, forever protecting slavery in the 
States. This was the supreme test of their 
desire for peace. They are to be " considered 
as having offered everything that could have 
been expected from wise, honest, and sincere 
men, for the pacification of the country, and, 
from the point of view of a sound political 
science, more than they ought to have done."' 
Our author here makes clear his settled 
opinion that every normal constitution essen- 
tially requires provisions for its own amend- 
ment; so the Eepublicans of 1861 were 
conceding unwisely in favoring the Corwin 
amendment. 

"An irrepealable, unamendable provision in a Con- 
stitution in regard to anything is a rotten spot, which 
threatens decay to the whole Constitution. It is a 
standing menace to the peaceable development of any 
political system. It is the most direct contradiction 
possible of one of the most fundamental principles of 
political science, the principle that the amending power 
in a constitution, the legally organized sovereign power 



in the political system of a country, must be able to 
deal with any and every subject. . . . The proposition 
to withdraw from its operation the most serious and 
burning question of our political ethics was a proposition 
to set the clock of ages back a century and more, so 
far as concerned the advancement of liberty and of the 
science of government. ... It meant the reversal, in 
principle, of the chief advance which we had made in 
the development of our constitutional law from the sys- 
tem of 1781 to that of 1787." 

These vigorous views relate to an episode that 
is past. But they are timely ; for they illus- 
trate principles of constitutional jurisprudence 
that are permanent and of perennial interest. 

Professor Burgess states fully, though 
briefly, the facts which put to rest the silly 
story that President Lincoln acted unfairly 
toward the secessionists in the matter of pro- 
visioning Fort Sumter. He defends not only 
the constitutionality, but the morality also, of 
the Emancipation Proclamation. The inherent 
Nationality of the Federal government, as an 
essential of political and constitutional science, 
is very clearly expounded ; and the entire reg- 
ularity and necessity of the exercise by the 
President of plenary powers in time of war are 
demonstrated as vigorously as they were by 
Solicitor Whiting himself during the war time. 

" It is altogether gratuitous to concede that the Gov- 
ernment of the United States overstepped its constitu- 
tional powers, and acted on the principle that necessity 
knows no law, in preserving the Union by force against 
dissolution. It overstepped its ordinary limitations, but 
it had, and has, the constitutional right to do that, in 
periods of extraordinary danger. The root of the error 
in denying this right lies in the claim that the Consti- 
tution made the Union. The truth is that the Union 
made the Constitution, and that the physical and eth- 
ical conditions of our territory and population made the 
Union." 

It is unpleasant to observe any defects, how- 
ever slight, in so fair a composition. But our 
author is an over-earnest controversialist ; and 
while uniformly measuring his expressions on 
all subjects of prime importance, he sometimes 
lapses into mere rhetoric when discussing minor 
topics. His very just animadversions upon the 
gross errors involved in John Brown's raid on 
Harper's Ferry derive no greater force from 
the abundant epithets which are here heaped 
upon the unfortunate Brown and his ill-fated 
cause. So, again, with reference to Lincoln's 
ancestry. It must have been some unfair pre- 
judice which described his father as " a dull, 
lazy, shiftless, poor white, of Kentucky back- 
woods life, the son of a man of the same sort "; 
and his mother, who is incorrectly said to have 
been " the daughter of one Lucy Hanks," as 
one of another family which " belonged like-

wise to the class of poor white trash." If it 
were desirable to refer at all to Lincoln's an- ' 
cestry, in such a history, the simple facts might 
have been given, instead of exploded myths. | 
The American people will forgive the poverty ' 
of Lincoln's parents, in view of the sturdy 
yeomanry which made their fathers successfal < 
pioneers in the new West of the eighteenth cen- | 
tnry, and in view of the intense antipathy to 
human slavery which governed their lives and 
descended to animate and distinguish the life 
and career of their great son. 

It is not quite clear why our author should 
admit, while he justifies the act, that Lincoln, 
on his accession to the Presidency, " shifted 
the whole issue " from the restriction of slavery 
to the maintenance of the Union. The Presi- 
dent in fact shifted no issue. The explanation 
of his emphasizing the preservation of the un- 
broken L^nion is so simple that no apology would 
be pertinent. The issue on which Lincoln was 
elected was at once forced to the background. 
Secession in arms brought forward a new and 
paramount issue : the Union must be fought 
for and preserved. It would have been idle 
to discuss any lesser issue, in the face of this 
greatest one of all. So thought the loyal mil- 
lions who rushed to the defence of the Union, 
at the call of the President. So will thousands 
of them testify to-day. 

The third volume in our list, entitled " Re- 
construction and the Constitution," is a de- 
tailed thesis on the processes employed for the 
rehabilitation of the insurrectionary States, 
from 1865 to 1872. The discussion refers, 
almost continuously, to the questions arising, 
as related to or affected by the Constitution, 
so that the narrative deals with constitutional 
history in the proper sense. The treatment of 
these questions by Professor Burgess is minute, 
discriminating, and often masterly. He is im- 
partial, both in praising and in blaming the 
leading actors of the Reconstruction period ; 
and his fearlessness in criticism, and his sin- 
cere desire to find and declare the true consti- 
tutional ground which should have been occu- 
pied at every step of the momentous proceed- 
ings, will challenge the commendation of un- 
biassed readers. The executive and the legis- 
lative branches of the government are by turns 
censored and applauded, as they have seen or 
failed to see the step proper to be taken at the 
moment. The Presidential policy is shown to 
have been erroneous in treating the statehood 
of the insurrectionary States as in no way 
vitiated by their attempts at secession, and in 



seekii^ to rehabilitate them by the employment 
of less than a full majority of the qualified 
electorate. The legislative policy was based 
npon the correct theory that the impaired f ano- 
tions of the insurrectionary States could be 
restored only by Congressional action ; but the 
mistakes made by Congress in working out 
this theory were glaringly worse than those of 
the Executive department in seeking to recon- 
struct without the agency of Congress. 

According to Professor Burgess, the States 
of the Union derived from the Constitution all 
their powers of local autonomy, and the logical 
consequence of an attempt to secede from the 
Union was to deprive the State so attempting 
of such autonomy, and reduce it to a Terri- 
torial condition : for it could not abridge the 
sovereignty of the Union over the land within 
its limits, and the act of rebellion against that 
sovereignty could have no other effect than the 
abjnration of Statehood by the offender. This 
being accepted as true, it is the author's view 
that but two modes of reconstrnction were 
logically feasible. 

" The one was, to establish territorial civil govem- 
ments in the late rebellioas region, and maintain them 
there until the civil relations between the two raees 
became settled and fixed. The other was, to so amead 
the Constitution of the United States, before the re- 
admission of the * States ' which had renounced the 
■ State ' form of local government under the Union, 
as to give Congress and the national judiciary the power 
to define and defend the fundamental principles of civil 
liberty. Neither of these methods would have demanded 
martial law or universal negro suffn^." 

Professor Burgess has a good word for the last- 
named project, which he tersely denominates 
" the nationalization of civil liberty." Bat 
his preference seems to have been for the plan 
first mentioned, of placing the insurrection- 
ary states under Territorial civil government, 
*' and keeping them there until the spirit of 
loyalty to the Nation was established, and the 
practice of civil equality among all citizens was 
made thoroughly secure. ' Our author does 
not refer to the great and undue anxiety which 
President Johnson was exhibiting at that time, 
to hasten his own scheme of Reconstruction by 
the appointment of " Provisional Grovemors." 
It was this precipitate action of the President 
which first invited the counteracting policy of 
Congress. Several of the Southern Governors 
had summoned their legislatures, as our author 
states, to meet for the purpose of Reconstruc- 
tion ; and they were, in some instances, dis- 
suaded from so meeting by officers of the Union 
Army. Johnson's hurried appointment of

" Provisional Governors " was a higher bid for 
Southern favor, and he was hoping to be thereby 
made the leading politician of the South. Lin- 
coln, if living, would have had no such motive 
for haste in making such appointments ; and 
if there had been disagreement between him 
and Congress, he would doubtless have been 
able to compose the difficulty. The delicate 
tact of Lincoln was wanting in Johnson's com- 
position. 

Professor Burgess is astute to expose each 
error which Congress made, either in departing 
from the logic of its own correct theory of the 
mode of Beconstruction, or in going counter to 
the Constitution. Of its errors of the first 
class, he says that " they intensified partisan- 
ship at the expense of statesmanship." It was 
a departure from the principles of the Consti- 
tution, when Congress arranged to have States 
not yet rehabilitated, — or still " out of their 
practical relations," as Lincoln phrased it, — 
to vote upon amendments to the fundamental 
law ; as also when a Freedmen's Bureau, upon 
the basis of a war measure, was created in time 
of peace ; and again when, by the Tenure-of- 
office act, it was attempted to deprive the 
President of bis normal functions under the 
Constitution. These purely constitutional ques- 
tions are discussed with a considerate calmness 
of expression that gives to the author's con- 
clusions the weight and emphasis of a judicial 
deliverance. But when he intermits his exami- 
nation of these general phases of Congressional 
power and function, to discuss the measures 
resorted to by the majority in Congress, then 
the jurist descends to the plane of the partisan, 
and calm exposition gives place to heated de- 
nunciation and the use of epithets. Several 
of the measures adopted by Congress are de- 
clared to have been " monstrous," although one 
of them is admitted to have been within its 
Constitutional powers. Constitutions were 
framed for some of the seceding States by 
"carpet-bag, scalawag, negro conventions." 
The reconstructed legislatures were " hideous " 
bodies of men, and the result of their work 
came near being " ghastly." This intensity of 
indignation felt by the historian will appeal 
strongly to all who, with him, disapprove the 
employment of temporary devices to maintain 
party control, which are 'm contravention of 
fundamental principles ; but it must be con- 
fessed that such a profusion of epithets is out 
of place in dispassionate history. Our author 
deals gently with the foibles of Secretary Stan- 



ton, and none of the many excesses of President 
Johnson provoke his resentment, save those 
attending his famous " swinging around the 
circle." How unwise and how uncalled for 
were the impeachment of President Johnson 
and his trial upon the impeachment, and how 
fortunate was his acquittal, are clearly demon- 
strated in a chapter which, by some oversight, 
has been entitled " The Attempt to Impeach 
the President." This chapter will be read with 
interest by the many, now living, who depre- 
cated at the time the extent to which partisan- 
ship had carried the majority in the lower 
house of Congress, j^^^^ ^^^^^ p^^^^^^ 



Correspondence of a !Loyai.i&t 
Family.* 



Books containing the " raw material" of the 
early history of our country are of much in- 
terest at the present time, and those on the 
Tory or Loyalist side are perhaps the more 
interesting because more rare. One of these 
has recently been issued privately under the 
title " Letters of James Murray, Loyalist." 
This book is formed by a selection from ma- 
terial left to the heirs of the late James Murray 
Robbins, of Milton, Massachusetts. It is edited, 
at the request of Mrs. Susan I. Lesley, a direct 
descendant of James Murray, by Mrs. Nina 
Moore Tiffany, author of several works on 
Colonial America, assisted by Mrs. Lesley 
herself, who was prevented by ill-health from 
doing the work alone. 

The story begins back on the Scottish bor- 
der, in Roxburghshire, where James Murray 
was born, of a good family. But it is not until 
his departure for the Carolinas, in 1735, that 
our interest quickens. He was then twenty- 
two, and in possession of a small patrimony, 
part of which he laid out in merchandise, ex- 
pecting also to invest in land on his arrival in 
America. His sister accompanied him, to- 
gether with some other young people sent in 
his charge, and several mechanics. His desti- 
nation was North Carolina ; and having letter* 
to Governor Johnston, then recently appointed, 
he took his place as a conservative and friend 
of the Governor, as opposed to the popular 
faction. He finally settled in Newton (after-

wards called Wilmington), where be had a 
faonse and lot in town, and a plantation abont 
fifteen miles oat. He lived in North Carolina 
from 1735 to 1765, and his letters at this 
period are mnch concerned not only with trade 
and family affairs, but also with factional 
politics, which disturbed North Carolina during 
the whole of his residence there. Mr. Murray 
soon became involved in these disputes himself, 
as he occupied the position of collector of the 
port and lat«r was a member of the Board of 
Councillors. His opinion of the people of 
North Carolina during his first years there was 
frankly expressed. 

•' I wish I coold write rou something agreable of the 
country, or rather the present set of inhabitants, for the 
place itself is well enough were it peopled bj frugal, 
honest, industrious people, who would not sacrifice the 
general good of the province for the obtaining their own 
private ends, or would not be so stupid as to be led by 
the nose by those that would. Then I might say, with- 
out the spirit of prophecy, that this Prorinee would 
soon be one of the best in America." 

Mr. Murray was a progressive and enterprising 
planter as well as trader ; and we read of rice 
crops, indigo, tar. pitch, and lumber, and later 
of a beginning at silk culture. The bricks for 
his new house were burnt by his laborers, and 
the lumber prepared in his own saw-mill. At 
one time he sent to New York for " a Sober 
diligent man, with or without a familly, Skilld 
in Tanning and Currying." at another for a 
" good Sawyer to tend a Saw Mill." His plan- 
tation, where he built a handsome house, was 
called Point Repose. His condition had steadily 
improved, until he was able to say, a few years 
before he finally left North Carolina : 

" I am not out of humour with the Country as yoo 
imagine. I am perswaded I have my health better here 
than I could have any where else, and my Improve- 
ments are amusements to my taste no other place could 
afford. As to the people, they are neither better or 
worse in gross than those of other Countries : that I 
have not been a greater favourite with them is more mv 
own fault than theirs." 

When, in 1765. Mr. Murray removed to 
Boston, it was with his second wife. He lost 
his first wife in 1758, and several children 
died both before and after this event. His 
youngest daughter, Elizabeth, remained with 
him for some time ; but Dorothy, the oldest, 
had been for several years with Mr. Murray's 
sister Elizabeth (Mrs. Smith, afterwards Mrs. 
In man) in Boston. They had friends and rel- 
atives in that city, and Mr. Murray, who, on 
his first visit to Boston, had conceived a dislike 
for the place, now fonnd it prosperous, pleas- 



ant, and congenial. In politics the family 
always remained conservatively loyal to the 
government, partly through disposition, partly 
because of the many family ties binding them 
to England and Scotland, and partly through 
conviction. Mr. Murray did, however, foresee 
possible union and severance in the future, bat 
be did not gaage the meaning of the demon- 
strations that were taking place in Boston at 
the time of his settlement there. In regard to 
the Stamp Act. he writes : 

" The Stamp Act, so far from being a hart to the 
Colonies, which they pretend to be unable to bear, will 
be a necessary Spur to their Industry. The Difficulty 
will be to keep that Industry from being employed on 
articles that will interfere with*the Mother Country, 
and so to preserve the Benefit & dependence of America 
to Britain as long as may be: but in the process of time, 
this extensive, fertile territory, cultivated as it will be 
by millions of people healthy and strong, must by the 
nature of things preponderate. Our comfort is that 
period seems to lie far beyond our day." 

When Boston was shut up, in April, 1775, 
and Cambridge became the camp of the Ameri- 
can army, Mr. Murray found himself separated 
from many of his friends. He and his wife, 
his brother-in-law Mr. Inman, his daughters 
Elizabeth and Dorothy (Mrs. Forbes), Mrs. 
Forbes's children, and a niece, were in Boston. 
Mrs. Inman, with a nephew and servants, was 
in Cambridge. She was respected by the pa- 
triots, many of whom were her friends. She 
writes hnmoronsly to her relatives in Boston : 

"You know bow fond I am of grandeur. I have 
aeted many parts in life, but never imagined I should 
arrive at the muekle honor of being a General ; that is 
now the case. I have a guard at the bottom of the 
garden, a number of men to patrol to the &Iarsh, and 
round the farm, with a body guard that now covers oar 
kitchen parlor, and [now at] twelve o'clock they are in 
a sweet sleep, while Miss Uenforth and I are in the 
middle parlor with a board nailed across the door to 
protect them from harm. . . . The women and children 
have all left Cambridge, so we are thought wonders." 

The annoyances the Loyalists endured were 
many. Mrs. Inman's friend, Mrs. Barnes, 
writing to her, says : 

" The greatest terror I was ever thrown into was on 
Sunday last. A man came up to the gate and loaded 
his musket, and before I could determine which way to 
ran he entered the house and demanded a dinner. I 
sent him the best I had upon the table. He was not 
contented, but insisted upon bringing in his gun and 
dining with me; this terrified the young folks, and they 
ran out of the house. I went in and endeavored to 
pacify him by every method in my power, but I found 
it was to no purpose. He still continued to abuse me , 
and said when be had eat his dinner he should want a 
horse, and if I did not let him have one he would blow 
my brains out."

After the battle of Bunker Hill, Mr. Murray 
writes : 

" Mr. Murray Presents his Affectionate Compliments 
to his Sister Inman & his Daughter Forbes. He has 
obtained Leave from the Commander in Chief to see 
them or either of them, with General Howe's consent, 
at the advanced posts of Charlestown on Saturday next. 
He proposes this Interview to be between the hours of 
Eleven & one O'CIock. Betsey is named in the Permit 
& purposes to be of the party. Mrs. Inman's old Ac- 
quaintance Colin Campbell, now a Captain in the 35th. 
Regt, intends to escorte us, if he shall be on duty, we 
shall bring some other officer to be Eye & Ear Witness 
of all that passes. And the Ladies are desired to use 
the same precaution, on their side: the Times require 
it." 

There were stilji merry-makings among the 
Tories, and in November Mrs. Inman writes 
to Dorothy Forbes : 

" Betsy is going to the Ball. She begs you'll send 
her stays, white satin ribbed ones, best laced ruffles, 
tucker, and some small flowers and a large one. . . . 
She has to wear colored clothes, therefore must have 
lace. . . . Pray send her fan and a pocket handker- 
chief; do not omit any of the things." 

Mr. Murray was an " Addresser of Gage," 
at the time of General Gage's recall to En- 
gland, and this was a mark against him in the 
eyes of the patriots. His sugar-house first 
served the King's troops as barracks, and was 
afterwards used as a hospital for patients inocu- 
lated for the small-pox. When Boston was 
evacuated, after the fortification of Dorchester 
Heights by Washington, Mr. Murray was 
obliged to sail for Halifax with Howe. He 
never saw Mrs. Inman or his daughters after- 
wards. He longed to be with them, however, 
and after settling his wife in Halifax he visited 
Newport, New York, and Philadelphia, — 
wherever he could be nearest to them, — and 
wrote and sent them supplies. But he returned, 
after two useless years, to Halifax, where he 
remained, in spite of his wife's desires to go to 
England. He died in 1781. His sister and 
children in Cambridge endured many hard- 
ships, with their resources reduced, and sepa- 
rated from their friends. Mrs. Inman died in 
1786, but Mrs. Forbes and Elizabeth Murray, 
afterwards Mrs. Robbins, lived to see a pros- 
perous and independent country. 

There are many interesting thmgs in this 
book upon '^hich we have not space to touch.

dants ; but the book as a whole is of so general 
an interest to students of American history

The Business of City Government.* 



Professor Fairlie may be said, without ex- 
aggeration, to have advanced municipal econ- 
omy to the status of an exact science : an 
achievement for which he was admirably fitted 
by his earlier studies for the National Munici- 
pal League and various periodicals and official 
publications, following a thorough university 
course in administration. By drawing upon 
the results of his previous studies and many 
: other sources of information, he has made his 
work on " Municipal Administration " ency- 
clopedic in scope and treatment. The bulki- 
ness of the volume is by no means due to dif- 
fuseness of style; the book is packed solidly 
full of facts, and facts many of which are not 
easily accessible elsewhere. A few technical 
points are treated with unnecessary detail, but 
in general the reader is more likely to wish for 
a fuller treatment than for further condensa- 
tion. The important question of the final dis- 
posal of sewage, for example, deserves more 
than a page and a half ; although even in that 
scant space Professor Fairlie distinguishes the 
principal methods in use and gives a convenient 
checklist of the cities (except in Australia) 
where each method is employed. 

The accuracy of such a work as this is of 
course subject to an inevitable limitation aris- 
ing from frequent changes in municipal ad- 
ministration, as well as to the practical impos- 
sibility of making so comprehensive a work 
on a new science absolutely infallible in the 
first instance. At first thought it seems a lit- 
tle curious that our own University of Cincin- 
nati should be omitted from a list of munici- 
pal colleges which embraces several European 
institutions, and that Seattle should be left 
out of an even longer list of cities maintaining 
employment bureaus ; but the fact of the' 
matter probably is that it is easier to get com- 
plete information about European cities than 
about those of our own country. The list of 
state employment bureaus might have been 
made more complete, however, if state under- 
takings were to be enumerated at all, and the 
same may be said of state parks ; while an 
account of state fire insurance ought not to 
overlook the curious and interesting experience 
of Vermont. The statement that American 
cities have abandoned their attempts at vacant- 
lot cultivation seems a little too sweeping.

The comprehensive character and admirably 
condensed style of this treatise may best be 
shown by quoting two paragraphs on an im- 
portant topic. 

" While municipal ownership of street rsdlwajs has 
thus existed in Great Britain since 1870, municipal 
operation was positively forbidden in the Tramways 
Aet of 1870, and is onlj of recent development. The 
first exception was in 1882, when the corporation of 
Hnddersfield was authorized to operate the local steam 
tramwajg, which had been abandoned by the operating 
company, provided no reasonable offer could be secured 
from another operating company to lease the lines ; 
and with some hesitation the experiment was beg^tm. 
The next instance of municipal operation occurred, 
not in Great Britain, but in the United States. When 
the Brooklyn Bridge over the East River was opened, 
in 1883, the cable road over it, one mile in length, waa 
from the start operated by the trustees or joint com- 
mittee representing the two municipalities of New 
York and Brooklyn. It continued to be operated by 
the bridge trustees until January 1, 1898, and after 
that by the Department of Bridges in the enlarged 
Sew York until July, 1898, when arrangements were 
made to operate it in connection with the Brooklyn 
elevated railroads by the company owning the latter 
roads. 

"The Hnddersfield and Brooklyn Bridge railways 
remained isolated examples, and did not mark the be- 
ginning of any movement toward municipal operation. 
It was not until 1893 that other examples appeared. 
In that year two British cities (Plymouth and Black- 
pool) received authority to operate their tramways. 
The year following, Leeds and Glasgow also began 
municipal operation. All of these instances were in 
the face of the Tramways Act of 1870 ; and a standing 
order of the House of Commons was now adopted 
shutting ont any further bills authorizing municipal 
operation. In 1896, however, this order was repealed; 
$he£Beld, Dover, Xottingham, and Hull thereupon 
received the necessary authority, and since then the 
movement in Great Britain has extended. Already 
twenty cities are operating the local railroads, the most 
important of which are Glasgow, the London County 
Council (which now owns 23 miles ont of 111, and is 
taking over other lines as the franchises expire), Liv- 
erpool, and Leeds. Half a dozen other towns are now 
making the transition, while still others, such as Bir- 
mingham and Manchester, have applied for authority 
and have declared their intention to work their lines 
on the expiration of the present leases. Barmen in 
Germany and Prague in Bohemia, and a few Swiss 
towns, also operate local street railroads; but there is 
no such general movement in other countries as in 
Great Britain." 

Of the four main parts into which the book 
is divided, dealing respectively with municipal 
history, activities, finances, and organization, 
this review has dealt almost wholly with the 
second, because it is the part which most 
needed to be written, and which will prove of 
greatest value ; but the other divisions of the 
work are treated in due proportion to their 
relative importance. The historical part might 



be considered disproportionately long, except 
that it includes two or three chapters of what 
might be styled present-day history, scarcely 
distinguishable from Part II. 

There are some evidences of hasty writing 
in irreconcilable disagreements between verbs 
and their subjects ; but there are scarcely any 
defects, either of form or substance, which 
would be worth calling attention to but for 
the certainty that so useful a book will soon 
run into a second edition. Max West.

Persia is playing a role of ever growing im- 
portance in Central Asia. The encroachment 
of Russia on the north, including their expul- 
sion of Persian ships from the Caspian Sea, 
has seriously limited the power of this ancient 
kingdom. The emulation, for a half-century, 
between Great Britain and Russia for supremacy 
of influence in the court of Persia, has been 
i one of the most interesting diplomatic plays in 
the Orient. She is now located between Rus- 
sia's possessions and the Persian Gulf — an 
outlet to the southern seas on which Russia has 
long cast a wishful eye. She is the back-door 
to Afghanistan and India, countries controlled 
by British influence and sovereignty. The 
right imperial authority in Persian territory 
could easily keep watch over the great and 
fertile Babylonian valley. An industrial and 
commercial Western nation would soon extract 
' from the mountains and plains of Persia an 
, almost boundless wealth of mineral and agri- 
cultural products. Her 640,000 square miles 
of territory, embracing some of the choicest of 
mountains and valleys, in the hands of twentieth- 
j century enterprise, would soon prove to be one 
I of the most resourceful of central Asiatic 
countries. 

Major Sykes, author of '• Ten Thousand 
Miles in Persia," is a good specimen of the 
enterprising and wide-awake Englishman who 
makes the most of his advantages. Besides 
eight years' residence in Persia, he travelled 
extensively in India, Russia, and Turkey. His

ceptional opportunities to ascertain facts, and 
to investigate subjects which were quite beyond 
the range of the ordinary globe-trotter. 

His journey begins by entrance into Persia 
from the north, by way of the Caspian Sea — 
ceded to Russia by the treaty of Turkomanchai. 
His first trip was through the dangerous Tur- 
koman territory, thence through Khorassan to 
Kerman. Of this latter province and its city 
he gives us an elaborate description — knowl- 
edge acquired through long residence and ex- 
tensive acquaintance. The magnificent moun- 
tains of this province are the salvation of its 
population. To those they retreat in the hot 
summer and from their melting snows they 
receive their supply of cool air and fresh water. 
Baluchistan must be the roughest, ruggedest, 
and most picturesque of countries, according 
to Major Sykes. A Baluchi proverb says : 
" When the Almighty created the world, Balu- 
chistan was formed from the refuse material." 
Its mountains, rising to 13,000 feet, with an 
active volcano (Chehl-Tan), and extensive 
ranges, give it a wild uninviting appearance 
except to adventurers. 

One of the interesting parts of the book is 
that which describes the Karun valley — the 
site of ancient Elamite authority with its 
fortressed-power at Susa. Modern conditions 
in that fruitful valley, — of the only navigable 
river in Persia — and its proximity to the 
maritime commerce of the Persian Gulf make 
it one of the most important sections for Per- 
sia's prosperity. To one interested in ancient 
history the most fascinating chapter of the 
volume is that (XXVIII) which describes the 
journey from Shiiaz to Isfahan. In this the 
author describes that cradle of the great ancient 
Achsemenian kings, presenting some admirable 
illustrations of these majestic ruins as they 
appear to-day. Major Sykes discusses in a 
very intelligent manner the commercial and 
political status of Persia in reference to the 
ambitious powers of to-day, plainly indicating 
that Great Britain is making no gains in this 
country. The familiar easy method of telling 
his story, and his abundant and beautiful illus- 
trations and good map of Persia, make Major 
Sykes's volume one of the most important of 
those in its field. 

The experiences of Mr. Wilfrid Sparroy, an 
English tutor at the court of the Sultan at 
Isfahan in Persia, are brimful of interest. 
The chapter on " The Uses of the Veil " is 
especially instructive as to the habits and 
customs of women in Persia, in contrast with 



those of their Western sisters. The concluding 
chapter, on " The Cat on the Footstool " — the 
figure formed by the geographical form of 
Persia, — is a spirited discussion of Russia's 
and England's influence at the court of the 
Shah. The author severely scores the lethargy 
of English officials, both in Persia and in Lon- 
don, and points out that the continuation of 
the present policy will mean the further decline 
and final fall of England's advantages in Persia. 
The book is supplied with choice illustrations 
depicting scenes at court described by the 
author, and also some of the most picturesque 
views on his travels. A little more pains in 
securing facts regarding many points discussed 
might have greatly increased the value of the 
work to the student of the Orient.

Briefs on New Books. 



" Many of the Letters in the present 
^'^!'!i'",j volume have come into my hands 

Since the first benes was pubhshed. 
The others, although they were not included in the 
previous collection, the object of which was to let 
FitzGerald tell the story of his own life, seem worthy 
of preservation, now that he has taken his place 
among English Letter-Writers. They are of the 
friendly human kind which entertained Carlyle." 
Thus Mr. William Aldis Wright by way of preface 
to "More Letters of Edward FitzGerald," recently 
published by the Messrs. Macmillan. There can 
be no doubt whatever that FitzGerald has taken 
the place indicated ; we should even have said the 
highest place, for surely there is no published cor- 
respondence in all our literature which exceeds in 
charm the three volumes (now four) which have 
been given us by FitzGerald's editor. Sach a 
collection is best reviewed by illustration, and we 
proceed at once to select a few striking passages. 
This is written to Pollock in 1846. " Have you 
seen Festus ? Tennyson writes word there are many 
fine things in it. He is come back from Switzer- 
land rather disappointed, I am glad to say. How 
could such herds of gaping idiots come back en- 
chanted if there were much worth going to see. I 
think that tours in Switzerland and Italy are less 
often published now than formerly ; but there is all 
Turkey, Greece, and the East to be prostituted 
also ; and I fear we shan't hear the end of it in our 
life time. Saffolk turnips seem to me so classical 
compared to all that sort of thing." Here is a 
critical comparison, dated 1869, the sanity of which 
will be better and better appreciated as the years 
pass. " There was an absurd Article in my old Ath- 
enaeum comparing the relative merits of Tennyson 
and Browning ; awarding the praise of Finish, etc., 
to A. T., and of originality to R. B.! I am not

perhaps sofficiently read in the latter ; for I never 
eoald read him ; and I have reliance on my own 
intuition that, such being the ease, he is not a rival 
to A. T., whom I judge of by hia earlier poems (up 
to 1842). In Browning I could but see little but 
Cockney Sublime, Cockney Energy, etc., and as 
you once very wittily said to me that Mies Bronte 
was a • great Mistress of the Disagreeable,' so. if B. 
haa.power, I must consider it of that sort. Tenny- 
son has stocked the English language with lines 
which once knowing one can't forgo. Cowell tells 
me that even at Oxford and Cambridge Browning 
is considered the deepest .' Bat ■ this also will pass 
away.' But not A. T." Here is an essentially 
just criticism of Lowell. •• With just a little less 
ambition of fine, or smart writing, Lowell might 
almost do for many books what Ste. Beuve has left 
undone. He has more Humour ; but not nearly so 
much Delicacy of Perception, or Refinement of 
Style; in which Ste. Beuve seems to me at the head 
of all Critics.'" Finally, we may quote a few words 
of FitiGerald's self-deprecatory allusion to his own 
work. In 1880 he writes of his own vog^e in the 
United States, humorously styling himself " the 
great American Pote," and says : " As to the Amer- 
icans you met, if I were ten years younger I should 
really be disquieted by such over-estimation as must 
make me ridiculous here." It was some ten years 
earlier that he had written to Woolner of his own 
" Persian things " that " they have their merits, 
and do very well to give to Friends, and to please 
a few Readers for the time, and then to subside — 
things of Taste, not of Genius at all — which, you 
know, is the one thing needful." 

Profe«sor Goldwin Smith has writ- 
tm'oMminlsmiii ^^^ many books larger than ''Com- 
monwealth or Empire "(Macmillan). 
but none more weighty or more clearly the utter- 
ance of large scholarly experience and wise philo- 
sophical refiection. It is a book that thoughtful 
Americans will do well to heed, for upon their 
decision concerning the momentous questions which 
it raises the fame of our country, now hanging in 
the balance, will largely depend. Against our 
Commonwealth, he impressively urges, "three 
forces, distinct but converged, are now arrayed. 
They are Plutocracy, Militarism, and Imperiahsm. 
The three instinctively conspire ; to the plutocrat 
Imperialism is politically congenial, while he feels 
that Militarism impregnates society with a spirit of 
conservatism, and may in case of a conflict of 
classes furnish a useful force of repression." Oat- 
lining the forces whereby popular government in 
our country has been steadily undermined of recent 
years, and the gradual growth of an unwritten 
Constitution which is fast coming to supplant the 
fundamental written instrument of our liberties, he 
pertinently says : " If to any one such a forecast 
seems visionary, let him ask himself whether a few 
years ago he could have dreamed that the princi- 
ples of the Declaration of Independence would be 



discarded and almost derided ; that dominion over 
other races would be forcibly assumed ; and that 
American citizens would be heard passionately 
calling upon their Government to shoot down as 
rebels people struggling for their independence 
against a foreign yoke." It is indeed a melan- 
choly plight to which our national rake's progress 
has brought as during the past four years, and the 
friendly dispassionate admonition of the political 
philosopher to " look here, upon this picture, and 
on this " does not exactly contribute to the self- 
esteem of men who are still capable of viewing 
recent developments in their true historical light. 
" The Declaration of Independence, it is true, was 
a creation of the eighteenth century ; its abstract 
doctrine of human equality belongs to the polideal 
philosopy of that era. But it has living force 
when it says, as in effect it does, that man shall 
not exercise lordship over man. When the people 
of the United States, after recognizing the Fili- 
pinos as their allies, bought them with their land of 
Spain, as they would buy the contents of a cattle- 
ranch or a sheep-fold, and proceeded to shoot them 
down for refusing to be delivered to the purchaser, 
they surely broke away from the principles on 
which their own polity is built, and compromised 
the national character formed on respect for those 
principles." How much finer than the base ideal 
that has dominated oar political action of late is 
the ideal set forth in the following words : " If 
the Commonwealth yearns for a grander part, a 
grander part may be found, not in partnership with 
aggressive power, but rather in morally upholding 
against aggression human independence and the 
rights of every member of the family of nations." 
This has hitherto been the part eonsist«ntly played 
by as in the theatre of world-polities. Mast we 
now renounce it forever ? Let the closing words 
of this little book answer the question for the 
faint-hearted who need an answer. '• The sun of 
humanity is behind a cloud. The cloud will pass 
away and the sun will shine forth again. The 
aged will not live to see it, but younger men will."

these is noted in every case, with the authority. 
Followed through several centuries in this manner, 
with a comparatively slight inquiry into the same 
names in the United States, founded upon the city 
directories of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, 
and Worcester, Mass., the lexicographer has been 
able to settle many disputed questions in the face 
of family traditions and prepossessions. The name 
" Howard," for instance, is traced to two distinct 
origins, one official, from " hay ward," and the other 
from the Christian name " Hereward." The at- 
tempt to connect " Howard " with " hogward " is 
made futile by proof that this official title becomes 
" Hoggart " in modern nomenclature. Too much 
praise can hardly be awarded these efforts of Canon 
Bardsley to throw light upon one of the darkest of 
dark places in etymology, and the hope may be ex- 
pressed that some person or persons of equal fitness 
will perform a similar task for Irish and Scotch 
names on one hand, and those of continental 
European origin on the other, thus covering the 
entire field. 

The poetry of Since the publication of his first 
Edward slender volume in 1868, the circle 

Roxoiandsui. „{ admirers of Edward Rowland 
Sill's poetic genius has slowly but steadily widened, 
until to-day the permanence of his literary reputa- 
tion seems assured. Notwithstanding this continued 
growth of interest, Sill's poetry has so far been 
accessible only in the four or five small volumes, 
issued at irregular intervals, in which it originally 
appeared. It is only now, more than fifteen years 
after the poet's untimely death, that his work is 
brought together in a single volume. For the tar- 
diness of this good office, however, ample atone- 
ment is made by the manner in which it has at 
last been performed. Produced by the " depart- 
ment of limited editions" at the Riverside Press, 
and published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 
the volume containing " The Poems of Edward 
Rowland Sill " is one which, in beauty and per- 
fection of typography, would do honor to the work 
of any writer. The general form and workman- 
ship are characterized throughout by a dignified 
restraint singularly in keeping with the character 
of the verse. The text is printed upon hand-made 
paper of strong fibre and unglazed surface, from 
type of a simple modern face. No display or orna- 
mentation of any sort is used ; a frontispiece por- 
trait in photogravure, and a small woodcut on the 
title-page, constitute the only embellishment. A 
statement of the principal facts in the poet's brief 
career is given as an introduction. The volume 
contains practically all of Sill's published verse, 
together with several poems hitherto uncollected ; 
so that we are now given opportunity for the first 
time of surveying his poetical achievement as a 
whole. The result cannot fail to increase our re- 
spect for the author and his work, and our regret 
that his career should have been cut short when it 
had only just begun. Brief as his career was, and 



incomplete as was bis work, it revealed qualities 
which distinguish poetry of the highest order, — a 
finished and facile expression, dignity, simplicity, 
and sincerity, unflinching idealism, and true love 
of nature. The present edition is limited to 500 
copies, all of which, we note, have now been sub- 
scribed for. 

The " Story of the Nations " series 
m'edS "Lme. (Putnam) adds to its list a volume on 
" Medi«val Rome," by Mr. William 
Miller, M. A., covering the five centuries lying be- 
tween Hildebrand (1073) and Clement VIII. 
(1600). Mediaeval Rome, like mediaeval Greece, 
has attracted less general attention than the clas- 
sical period ; yet without some knowledge of its 
chequered annals, one cannot fully appreciate and 
enjoy a large part of the archseological and artistic 
treasures of the Eternal City. Moreover, the per- 
iod is full of a romance and poetry and tragedy 
of its own. The meteor-like course of Hildebrand, 
the life and death of Arnold of Brescia, the mas- 
terful figure of the Third Innocent, the melan- 
choly failure of the dreamer Cola di Rienzo and 
his still more unfortunate disciple Porcaro, the 
crimes of the Sixth Alexander, and the pomps and 
pageants of Leo X., — all these fall within this 
period. The story in the main is gloomy ; the 
feuds and fevers, the appalling crimes and stu- 
pendous criminals in high places, the want of prin- 
ciple in all classes, fill the larger spaces on the 
canvass. Still, with all its faults, the Roman life 
of the Middle Ages cannot have been without its 
charm. The dreamy old ruins which fired the 
fancy of a Petrarch and a Rienzi must have looked 
more poetic in their deserted savageness than the 
trimly-kept excavations of to-day. It was a quaint 
fancy of the old Romans to spell the name of their 
city, Roma, backward, and call it Amor — Love. 
Even a modern, provided he fully enters into the 
spirit of its extraordinary and still unfinished 
career, gladly accepts this transposition. Whether 
ruled by Kings, by a Republic, by Emperors, or by 
Popes, there is not a page of her history we can 
afford to miss, and each contributes to the charm 
which comes with the very utterance of the word 

Some. 

The Right Reverend John Lancaster 
sTh^T^l^g Spalding, Bishop of Peoria, occu- 
pies a leading position among his 
brother prelates of the Roman Church. Like 
nearly all of these dignitaries, he is an adminis- 
trator, a theologian, and an educator. But while 
in such cases the emphasis is usually laid upon the 
two former of these offices, in his case it is to be 
placed rather upon the last of the three. Add to 
this a pronounced trend toward literature, shown 
by the publication of several volumes of verse 
besides numerous essays and reviews, and marked 
ability as an orator, both in and out of the pulpit, 
and it becomes evident that we have here an 
American of real influence. The latest volume

from hig pen, " Beligion, AgnostieUm, and Edaea- 
tion " (MeClarg), comes, therefore, with claim to 
the most eerioas consideration at the hands of his 
fellow-citizens, to none of whom does he yield in 
point of attachment to the institutions of hig natire 
land. Bishop Spalding's repatation as a scholar is 
abundantly sastained by the two pap>er8 which lead 
his book, on " Religion " and " A^gnosticism " re- 
spectively. It is hardly too much to say that in 
these he has given a history of philosophic thought 
not surpassed for thoroughness and succinctness in 
modem writing. These are followed by a more 
openly controversial chapter in the form of a reply 
to the late Robert 6. IngersolL, entitled '■ God in 
the Constitution." The remaining essays are de- 
Toted to education and religion, closing with an 
impassioned and eloquent tribute to the Mother 
Church, " The Victory of Love." Few books bet- 
ter worth attention have been lately pat forth, the 
author's felicity of diction alone entitling these 
essays to consideration from those who appreciate 

literary style. 

Two late additions to the " Medieval 
^iilS^ Towns" series (Dent-Macmillan) 
are "Cairo " by Dr. Stanley Lane- 
Poole, and " Chartree " by Cecil Headlam. The 
most interesting things are always the unfamiliar ; 
what one goes to Cairo to see is the real Eastern 
life in its Eastern setting. No better guide to this 
strange country — because no one has studied it 
longer or more intimately — could be found than 
the Professor of Arabic in Trinity Collie, Dublin. 
Only from one who writes out of a full mind do we 
get a book written with such simplicity and sense 
of proportion. The European changes of the last 
twenty years are ignored as far as possible, the 
illustrations being chosen from the earlier period, 
and the text aiming to reproduce the associations 
that lend the city its deepest interest. — In the vol- 
ume on Chartres, the main interest is a religious 
one ; the cathedral its chief glory, felt by everyone 
but by no one so well described as by Lowell : 
" SUeot and gnj aa fanat-laspired cliff 
Left inlasd bj the oeeaa'a dow retreat." 

Naturally, the most interesting chapters to the 
reader are the ones dealing with this wonderful 
fane. Mr. Headlam is both discriminating and 
eloquent here, and shows himself a genuine appre- 
ciator from every point of art and human interest 
The numerous etchings by Herbert Railton are not 
the least charming feature of a thoroughly delight- 
ful volume.

'■ The Night Side of London " (Lip- 
pincott) is a study in those forbidden 
things which make so profound an 
appeal to the adolescent — in either years or morals. 
Mr. Robert Machray knows the world's metropolis 
thoroughly, and he rambles from the balls, dinners, 
theatre parties and little suppers of the " smart set " 
to the diversions of the " hooligans " with an abrupt- 
ness that would be disconcerting if the reader did 



not bear in mind that to the majority of well-bred 
English-speaking people all these varied amuse- 
ments are held in equal detestation. The book 
brings vividly to mind the fact that, while the 
churches and other agencies for good are usually 
punctual in closing their doors and bidding good- 
night to the world soon after sunset, the agents of 
evil are just then beginning their propagandas, — 
the old story of the strait and narrow way, and the 
broad path that leads to deatraetion. Mr. Maehnij 
was accompanied on his toon of discovery bj Mr. 
Tom Browne, the illustrator, and the twain have 
worked together with effective harmony. All sorts 
of scenes and things disclosed themselves to the two 
inquirers, most of them forming discouraging read- 
ing to those who like to think London an advance 
upon imp>erial Rome in affairs of the spirit. From 
the dissipations of the great world and the little, the 
story wanders away, toward the end of the volume, 
to the coasts of Bohemia ; and here the night life 
of modern civilization presents itself at its best. 
" For Bohemia," Mr. Machray observes, " is not 
the name of a country, or a place, or even of a 
'quarter,' but is that of a condition, a state of mind 
aod heart, the outward expression of a temperament 
which reveb in the joy of life." 



Mr. Michael Davitt's account of 
"The Boer Fight for Freedom" 
litimitmr. (Funk & Wagnalls) is an exeeUoit 

antidote to the history of the same event prepared 
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. That is, it em 
about as far on the side of the burghers as Sir 
Arthur's does on the side of the British, both being 
written from a frankly declared point of view which 
makes them controversial narratives rather than 
sober recitals of fact. Mr. Davitt, it will be re- 
membered, resigned his seat in Parliament upon 
the breaking out of war between the Republics and 
Great Britain, in order to go to the front — with 
the burghers, of course. Daring his extended so- 
journ he became well acquainted with the leaders 
of the Dutch, and he has dedicated his work to the 
memory of General Philip Botha. It may be said 
that this account of the war is more complete than 
any other now before the pablie, — the information 
on the British side being aeeeasible to the world, 
while it is only through such an> experience as this 
that one can obtain the burghers' side of a con- 
troversy so inflamed by race hatred and the horrors 
of war. Mr. Davitt has used this knowledge to the 
utmost, setting down his facts with righteous indig- 
nation against the aggressor that makes his pages 
fairly bum. The whole narrative, long as it is, 
comes with a rush and vigor, an enthusiasm over 
the early successes of the republican arms, a pity 
for chivalry so often mistaken, and an inherited 
disbelief in the protestations of Great Britain which 
hold the attention, if not always the approval, of 
the reader. Numerous illustrations, reproductions 
of photographs, aid in the effectiveness of the story.

[Sept. 16, 



Mrs. W. K. Clifford's second drama, 
f^Z^ZT " The Long Duel " (John Lane), is 

founded upon a short story pub- 
lished ten years ago, one of the few of her earlier 
tales that was not of tragical import. And even 
this, though a comedy of modern life in the full 
sense of the word, comes near to satire in its 
bringing together of two lovers' long separated, one 
a French painter of the first distinction, and the 
other an Englishwoman ennobled by the mercenary 
marriage she had made when the artist, little more 
than a student then, was discarded. A love-match 
between two young people in whom these elders 
are interested, one on either side, brings up the 
earlier circumstance to both. Lady Harlekston 
persuades Carbooche to paint her portrait. This 
he does, in a spirit of revenge, only too truthfully. 
She revenges herself in turn by persuading him, 
through tender recollections artfully brought for- 
ward, to erase the lines which age and easy living 
have put in her face, and, this done, by turning 
upon him as one whom she had fooled. Carbouche 
has the painting destroyed, and the play might 
have been ended there, with a psychological 
tragedy of the sort Mrs. Clifford has been so fond 
of. Bat a fourth act follows, in which the painter 
learns for the first time that the Lord Harlekston 
he has met is the stepson of the woman he had 
loved, and that she is a widow. So the curtain 
falls, not too convincingly, upon a "happy ending."

Mr. Paget Toynbee's "Dante Studies and Researches" 
(Button) is a volume of chips from the workshop in 
which the author's great " Dictionary " was fashioned. 
The contents are, for the most part, extensions of mat- 
ters briefly treated in the " Dictionary " and have been 
published, with a few exceptions, in various learned 
periodicals, English, American, Italian, and French. 
Among the longer studies we may mention the follow- 
ing : " Dante and the Lancelot Romance," " Some Ob- 
ligations of Dante to Albertus Magnus," "Dante's 
Latin Dictionary," and the review of Professor Rajno's 
text of the " De Vulgari Eloquentia." The majority 
of the articles are mere notes, but they represent an 
extraordinary amount of research, and are made fully 
accessible to the student by a comprehensive index. 

A new edition of the Rev. Alexander Dyce's " Glos- 
sary to the Works of William Shakespeare," edited by 
Mr. Harold Littledale, has just been published by 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. The chief task of the re- 
viser has been to alter the reference figures in such 
manner as to make them useful with other texts than 
that of Dyee. Although Schmidt's "Lexicon " and Bart- 
lett's " Concordance " have both been published since 
the first appearance of this " Glossary," it may fairly be 
said that they do not take its place. At the same time

who care for the making of fine books. 

W. E. Chanuing's biography of Thoreau has been so 
long out of print that the announcement of a new edition, 
embodying additional material left by Channing, is a 
welcome one. The volume will be supplied with an 
introduction, notes, and a full index by Mr. F. B. San- 
bom, and will be issued in attractive typographical 
form by Mr. Charlea £. Goodspeed of Boston. 

In response to the increasing demand for historical 
lit«r«tare, Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. announce a 
scheme which they have long had under consideration, 
of a uniform series of reprints of standard historical 
novels. They expect the cooperation of an English house 
famous for its success with several series of books se- 
lected and made with extraordinary taste and discretion. 

The " Summer Classes for the Study of English," 
under the direction of Mrs. H. -A.. Davidson and Prof. 
S. C. Hart of Wellesley College, were held this year 
at Delhi, New York. The organization of this small 
special school is that of a club of persons drawn to- 
gether by similar purposes and tastes, and the courses 
of study offered were entirely within the field of 
English. 

For several days it was feared that Prof.v Angelo 
Heilprin had been lost in tbe recent eruption of Mt. 
Pel^e, and the news that be is returning to this country 
with a large amount of fresh information means a dis- 
tinct addition to our scientific knowledge. He proposes 
embodying his experience and scientific deductions in a 
work DOW nearly complete, and to be published this fall 
by J. B. Lippincott Company. 

The FaU Ust of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. is 
the most important and attractive ever presented by 
this house, eviucing in both literary and mechanical 
features altogether new and progressive standards. 
The first books to appear will be Mr. Will Payne's 
volume of short stories, "On Fortune's Road"; a 
translation of Felix Dahn's " A Captive of the Roman 
Eagles," by Miss Mary J. Safford ; " In Argolis," an 
account of a Summer in Greece, by Mr. George Hor- 
ton, beautifully printed at the Merrymonnt Press ; and 
two new volumes bv Mr. George P. Upton, " Musical 
PasteU " and " The SUndard Light Operas." 

During the Autumn five books will be issued by the 
" department of special editions " of The Riverside 
Press. The most important of these, and also the most 
ambitious work yet undertaken by the Press, will be a 
reprint of the Essays of Montaigne, in Plorio's trans- 
lation, edited by Mr. George B. Ives. This edition 
will appear in three folio volumes, printed from a 
specially-designed font of type, and illustrated with 
frontispiece portraits, decorative headings and initials, 
engraved on wood. The other Fall issues will consist 
of Gabriel Nand^'s " Instruction concerning Erecting 
of a Library," reprinted from the English translation 
of 1661 ; tbe Anti-Slavery Papers of James Russell 



Lowell, now first collected ; a hitherto uDpablisbed 
" Journal of a Tour in the Netherlands," from the pen 
of Robert Southey ; and a quarto reprint of Spenser's 
" Prothalamion" and " Epithalamion," with photogra- 
vures and a title-page vignette from drawings by Mr. 
Edwin H. Blashfield. 

The University of Chicago Press will publish this 
month a work by Mr. Ralph C. H. Catterall on " The 
Second Bank of the United States," treating at length 
both the monetary and political questions connected 
with that institution. In the series of preprints from 
the " University of Chicago Decennial Publications " 
there will appear at once " The Physical Characters of

It is BO very many years ago that the poem of « Fe»- 
tos " leaped into meteoric fame, winning the applant* 
of Tennyson and being likened to " Faust," that many 
persons must have been surprised to read of the author's 
death only a few days ago. Philip James Bailey was 
bom in 1816, and has just died at the age of eighty- 
six. " Festus " was published in 1839, and passed 
through many editions in both England and America. 
To the present generation the poem is unknown except 
as a curious phenemenon in literary history. William 
Allen Butler is another writer known chiefly by a single 
poem who has died this month. He was bom in 1825, 
and was one of the foremost of New York lawyers. 
"Nothing to Wear" was published anonymously in 
1857, and was not acknowledged by the author nntO 
several years afterwards. 

The literary achievements of Indiana have been 
made the subject of a good many newspaper articles, 
which have had much to say abont certain popular but 
unimportant writers, and have nsually forgotten to 
mention the man to whom the state owes its chief lit- 
erary distinction. Edward Eggleston made Indians 
famous at a time when literature was almost an on- 
known quantity west of the Alleghanies, and his death 
is a loss to the whole country. Bopn in 1837, his 
early years were spent among rural surroundings, from 
which he was unconsciously absorbing the material that 
he afterwards used with such vivid effect in his novels. 
He was unable to get a college education, and entered 
the Methodist ministry at the age of nineteen. When 
about thirty years of age, he gave up ministerial for 
editorial work, and, a few years later removed to the 
East. With the exception of "The Graysons," his 
|>opular novels were written during the seventies. The 
best known of them are " The Hoosier Schoolmaster,'* 
« The End of the Worid," " The Mystery of Metrop- 
olisville," « The Circuit Rider," and " Roxy." Daring 
the last twenty years of his life, his energies were 
almost wholly devoted to his works on American his- 
tory, for which he prepared himself by a long period 
of extensive and patient research. Besides his school 
books in this department, he wrote " The Beginners of 
a Nation " and " The Transit of Civilization." He died 
on the third of this month at his country home on 
Lake George, where the greater part of his later years 
were spent.

[Sept. 16, 



Announcements of FaliL Books. 

The Dial presents herewith its annual list of books 
announced for Fall and Winter publication. This list 
is, as usual, the first comprehensive and classified in- 
formation regarding the Fall books to be given the 
book-purchasing public. Entry is here made of over 
fourteen hundred titles, representing the output of fifty 
leading American publishers. The list has been pre- 
pared entirely from advance information secured espe- 
«ially for this purpose. All the books entered are 
presumably new books — new editions not being in- 
cluded unless having new form or matter ; and, with a 
few necessary exceptions, the list does not include Fall 
books already issued and entered in our regular List of 
New Books. 

The more important literary features of the list are

For the student and the writer, as an authoritative reference book for schools, families, and business men, tiiere is one book 
which offers superior adrantag'es both in the solid value of its information, and the ease with which it is obtained. 

One's admiration for Webster's International Dictionary increases daily as it comes to be better known. It never refuses 
the information sought and it never overwhelms one with a mass of misinformation illogically arranged.

THE LITERATURE OF 

AMERICAN HISTORY 

EDITED BY 

J. N. LARNED 



VX/ITH the editorship of Mr. J. N. Larned, forty scholars and critics, 
each an acknowledged authority in a particular field of American 
history, have selected the 4000 works here presented, and given them brief 
descriptive and critical notes, so that for the first time the literature of Amer- 
ican history is charted for the behoof of the reader and student, with frank 
and impartial criticism of books which do not seem to deserve the acceptance 
they enjoy. The chief historical societies of America are named, together 
with their most important issues. The sources of American history are out- 
lined by Mr. Paul Leicester Ford, so that the student may pass directly to 
first-hand authorities and pursue a special research as far as he pleases. 
Much of the best biography, many of the most instructive and entertaining 
works of travel, of ethnological investigation, of scenic and scientific descrip- 
tion of America are included. Canada, the West Indies, Central and South 
America have departments. 

Professor Edward Channing, of Harvard University, appends lists for 
A SCHOOL LIBRARY, A TOWN LIBRARY, A WORKING LIBRARY.

" The old Indian trails ttave always liad a fascination for me." — Prttideni Roo$evelt. 

" I think rerj liiglilT of yonr plan as ontlined in yonr prospectus. The historr of American trails aad 
carries in colonial times, of p&tlis, roads, and higliwajs in onr national beginnings, and of oar great lake, 
river, and railroad traffic in later times, is and has been of the first imprataaaa ia oar aoeial and politieal 
history. Mr. Holbert has shown himself abondantlj able to inrestigate the sabieet and pat in good form 
the results of his labors." — William M. Sloane, Priooeton CniTersi^. 

" An experienced worker in his chosen field." — Nation. 

" As shown bj his publications, and still more by the manuscript of proepe e t i Te work which I have 
had the faror of seeing, Archer B. Hulbert has entered a new field of American research and scholarship — 
a field in which ethnologr, archsologr, and history blend in most enticing fashion. The ways trod by onr 
pioneer ancestors, by the Bed Men before them, and by beasts of the woodland and prairie still earlier, 
ought to have place in our knowledge; they are gone from the maps aad are fading from memory. 
Mr. Hulbert is helping us to hold fast to onr rightful heritage." — W. J. McGee, Smithsonian Institution. 

" The plan strikes me as an admirable one, and I am snre the result will be useful to historical inves- 
tigators as well as to the general reader. I have found Mr. Hulbert's former volumes very useful in my 
work on Western history ; they make much of the military and pioneer period easier to understand and em- 
phasize the close connection of physiography and history." — Frederick J. T'umcr, University of Wisconsin. 

" I learn with great pleasure that yon are intending to enlarge your series of monog^phs on Historic 
Highways of America. This important subject has been too little treated. I have found the volames 
that you have published both interesting and instructive, and I am snre that historians throughoot the 
country will thank you for continuing yonr valuable researches." — Albert Buthn^ Hart, Harvard University. 

" The author has the true historic spirit, the rich imaginative vision, and the true descriptive power 

all in keeping with his most fascinating subject." — George H. Spaulding, D.D., LL.D., New York City.

» HTHE LADY POVERTY " is a medieval 
^ romance, simple in form and charming in 
conception, telling how St. Francis wooed and 
won that most difficult of all Brides — my Lady 
Poverty. Apart from its beauty it is noteworthy 
as the first book written concerning St. Francis 
of Assisi, having been completed within a year 
after the Saint's death (a.d. 1227). The little 
volume here offered is the first English translation, 
and faithfully enshrines the spirit of the original. 
The volume opens with a bibliographical in- 
troduction by the translator, and closes with an 
extract from the Xlth canto of Dante's " Para-

THE STORY OF A STRANGE CAREER 

Being the Autobiography of a Convict. An Authentic Document. Edited by Stanley Waterloo. 
l2mo, cloth, ;^i.20 net ; postage, 12 cents additional. 

This distinctly original work is the life story of a criminal, written by himself while serving a 
term in a Western penitentiary. Originally of good birth and education, the man seems to have 
been a born degenerate, swerving naturally into the downward path. He gives many graphic and 
interesting descriptions of his adventures on a whaler in South America; on a British man-of-war; 
in the American navy; at Fort Fisher; in Confederate prisons during the civil war; and in the New 
York draft riots. It is a strong and rugged picture of the seamy side of the life of a sort of unpre- 
sentable " soldier of fortune." The manuscript came into the hands of Mr. Waterloo about a year 
ago and by him has been edited for purposes of publication.

Mr. Wells's vivid imagination and playful humor never found happier expression than in this 
fantastic yet wholly amusing story of a modern mermaid who is cast up by the sea into the electrified

suit, which becomes her amazingly, only — it does not hide the indispensable trademark of mermaids, 
the fatal Tail !

Bass Blake is quite a young man, but though " A Lady's Honor " is his first novel, he does 
not make with it his first appearance in literature. He published last year a book on the British 
Fleet in peace and war, entitled "How Sailors Fight." Captain Lambton, late of the Powerful, and 
Commander of the Naval Brigade in Ladysmith, wrote an introduction for it, and it was warmly 
received by the London papers.

One of the three or four most successful writers of fiction in recent years is Sir Gilbert Parker, 
whose honor of knighthood came to him just as his present volume was getting ready for press. His 
Canadian romance, "The Seats of the Mighty," has gone through more editions than, at this writing, 
could be conveniently named. " Donovan Pasha " will illustrate Sir Gilbert's talents in a new field.

By Dana C. Munro, A.M., University of Pennsylvania. i2mo, cloth. (Ready Soon.) 

This volume covers the period from Charles the Great to the beginning of the fourteenth 
century, with an introduction that discusses briefly the events of the preceding centuries, which is 
necessary for an understanding of what follows. As there is a greater interest at present in the social 
life of our ancestors than in their wars and contests, more attention is given to the development of 
the civilization of the period treated.

LITERARY C OSMO POLITANISM. 

The most casual observer of literary affairs 
cannot have failed to notice the growth of the 
cosmopolitan spirit that has characterized both 
the reading and the writing of recent years. 
In every country the reading public looks as 
eagerly abroad as it looks around at home for 
new literary forms and tendencies, and the 
writing guild is everywhere quick to seize upon 
new motives and situations, whatever their 
origin. No literature of the present day is as 
self-contained as every literature was fifty or 
a hundred years ago, and we are constantly 
called upon to witness a confnsion of styles 
and ideals resulting from our generous modern 
outlook upon life. It is not merely that the 
commanding personalities of contemporary lit- 
erature attract widespread attention in other 
countries than their own, — that has always in 
a measure been the case, — but it is rather that 
writers of quite secondary importance, if pos- 
sessed of any distinctive qualities of thought 
or expression, now find translators in every 
country, and their voices penetrate to the re- 
mote parts of the earth. 

We are inclined to think that the share of 
America in this modern broadening of literary 
interest has been considerable. It may be for 
the reason that our own production has not 
thus far been as remarkable as we could wish, 
or it may be because of the variety of racial 
elements that have become blended in our 
society, that we have extended so cordial a wel- 
come to the books that have come to us from 
other nations. It is certainly true that from 
the days of Emerson's Concord with its at- 
mosphere of intellectual curiosity down to the 
days in which we now live the American atti- 
tude toward European literature — not En- 
glish alone — has been peculiarly receptive and 
has evinced an unusual catholicity of taste. We 
have sought for the best wherever it might be 
found, and our finer spirits, at least, lived in 
the light of Matthew Arnold's definition of 
culture long before it was put into words. 

That this liberal outlook has had a stimu- 
lating reaction upon English taste may hardly 
be doubted. The work of such pioneers as 



202 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Ticknor and Longfellow aroused many En- 
glishmen to the interesting possibilities that 
they were neglecting ; such counsel as that of 
Emerson encouraged them to broaden their 
view ; such work as the American translations 
of Goethe and Dante provided them with a 
wholesome incentive to deal more seriously 
with the masterpieces of foreign literature. 
Coming down to more recent years, we may 
say that the names of Ibsen and Tolstoi be- 
came vitally significant in America before they 
did in England ; we may notice that Amer- 
ican translations of Balzac and Tourguenieff 
and Bjornson preceded the English ones, and 
we may recall the introduction of Sienkiewicz to 
the English public by an American translator. 
These few items of the account may stand for 
the many others that might be adduced and 
serve to show that in this matter of cosmo- 
politanism the example of America has not 
been without its influence upon our kinsmen 
over-sea. 

In this binding of the nations by the ties 
of mutual sympathy and appreciation, this 
practice of give and take in the domain of the 
intellectual interests, there is undoubtedly 
much benefit to all concerned. To be able to 
assume temporarily the attitude of the out- 
sider is the best possible corrective for pro- 
vincialism, and the ideals that result from a 
nation's own inner development need the test 
of comparison to assure their validity. Our 
modern commerce of thought is constantly 
invoking such comparisons, and the gain to 
both parties is obvious. The instinctive ideal 
either becomes a rational one, or it falls into 
decay through the discovery of its irrationality. 
It is not always pleasing to our self-esteem to 
suffer this disillusionment, but when we have 
once been made to realize that ours is not the 
better way — that the Frenchman, or the 
Russian, or the Scandinavian, has pursued a 
worthier ideal than ours — there is nothing for 
it but to accept the lesson and profit by the 
instruction. On the other hand, it may some- 
times happen that the comparison will leave us 
convinced that our own aim has been the finer, 
and that it is our function in this respect to 
teach and not to learn. We are then in the 
fortunate case of having grounds for the faith 
that is in us, and what was before an instinct 
is now an unshakable conviction. 

This problem has, however, another and 
possibly a deeper aspect which we are bound 
to take into consideration. To what extent 



are ideals absolute, and to what extent are they 
merely relative to seme particular people, or 
epoch, or stage in the social evolution of the 
race ? We know well enough that principles 
of human conduct, seemingly fundamental, 
have, in the course of history, undergone slow 
and subtle alterations of which the cumulative 
effect has amounted in time to a complete 
transformation. And if different ideals may 
properly hold sway in different historical 
periods, may they not properly hold sway at 
the same time among different peoples? In 
other words, are we so very sure that what is 
best for Englishmen, even in their treatment 
of the ordinary human relations, must also be 
best for Frenchmen and Germans and Italians ? 
To argue that this must be the case because of 
the evident drawing together of the modern 
nations in a common cosmopolitan culture is 
evidently to beg the very question at issue. 
May it not rather be urged, and plausibly too, 
that each race or nation has its own peculiar 
genius, and that this genius will bring forth 
its finest fruits if left to develop in accordance 
with the principle of its own being? 

So we see that the matter is not as simple 
as at first it appears to be. The names which 
denote the several historical peoples have un- 
doubtedly stood, throughout the centuries, for 
certain distinctive groups of characteristics. 
There would seem to be no little of the doc- 
trinaire spirit in measuring them all with the 
same tape, and judging them all by the same 
set of moral standards. Yet in this spirit the 
common run of mankind formulates its histor- 
ical judgments, as do also the professional 
writers of history, with few exceptions. A 
Greek or Boman practice is condemned out- 
right by reference to the standards of to-day 
instead of being dispassionately viewed in the 
light of the civilization which it helps to illus- 
trate. Similarly, although it must be admitted 
with far greater apparent justification, the 
modern moralist almost unconsciously takes 
the practice of his own people as the norm by 
which he estimates the virtues and the short- 
comings of all other peoples, instead of making, 
as he should do, a resolute effort to get into 
the moral consciousness of the race which he 
is studying, and thus view its problems as 
matters for sympathetic interpretation rather 
than for praise or disapproval. 

But we are wandering afield from our sub- 
ject, and must get back to the starting-point. 
The principle of the relativity of ideals above

THE DIAL. 



set forth might be applied in the regions of 
law and government, of education and religion, 
and when we restrict its application to the 
region of literature, the limitation is more ap- 
parent than real. A recent writer upon Ameri- 
can literature finds that the English Bible and 
the English common law have to be taken 
largely into consideration in accounting for it, 
and the literature of every people has a way of 
getting itself mixed up with most of the deeper 
human concerns. So in its more simplified 
form our question becomes this : Does the 
genius of a people reach its fullest and richest 
expression in a literature that is reasonably 
self-contained, or are still finer results to be 
reached by the cultivation of an openly re- 
ceptive attitude toward the contemporary lit- 
erature of other countries ? We have no notion 
of answering this question, but will remain 
content with having raised it, and with bring- 
ing forward a few of the larger lessons of lit- 
erary history that seem to have some bearing 
upon its settlement. 

The literature of the Greeks will stand for 
all time as the supreme example of a growth 
from within, of the multifold and marvellous 
efflorescence of the genius of a race. Here 
we find no admixture of foreign infinence 
worth mentioning, and yet we find all the chief 
forms of literary composition developed to a 
state of perfection that must ever remain oar 
despair. Themselves self-taught, the Greek 
writers have been the teachers of all civilized 
mankind since their day. We can surely find 
no cause for regret in the fact that they re- 
mained unacquainted with either Chinese sages 
or Hebrew prophets. The native sublimity of 
JEschylus at least equalled that of Isaiah, and 
the wisdom of Socrates and Plato surpassed 
that of Confucius. With the Bomans the case 
was greatly different. Before the Latin genius 
had the opportunity of self-realization, it fell 
under the spell of the Greek spirit, and assim- 
ilated what it might of an alien culture. The 
result was a hybrid literature which repre- 
sented the best of two races, and produced a 
series of fine models, yet which might con- 
ceivably have reached a still finer development 
had it been free to work out its native ideals. 
With this idle hypothesis we must dismiss a 
question that may never be answered. 

When the middle ages came into po nacoa ion 
of the classical inheritance, at first in frag- 
mentary and imperfectly appreciated forms, 
afterwards in the wealth of the whole treasure- 



house thrown open to the scholars of the Re- 
naissance, the influence was undoubtedly for 
good, and is writ large in the history of re- 
viving humanism. Although the modern lit- 
erature had made promising beginnings un- 
aided by the best classical examples, it can 
hardly be doubted that the stimulus of the 
classical revival was wholly fructifying and 
beneficent. Even at the full flood of Renais- 
sance enthusiasm, the European republic of 
letters was poor in numbers, and its cidzens 
needed just such a bond of unity as was afforded 
by their common delight in the rediscovered 
works of antiquity. It is true that some could 
find no better use for these works than to hold 
them as models for servile imitation, and it is 
also true that their infiuence prolonged the life 
of the Latin language and retarded the devel- 
opment of the various vernaculars of Europe, 
but, on the whole, the specific genius of Italian, 
or French, or English did not lack in the power 
of self-assertion, and gained little that was not 
good from the stimulating and steadying ex- 
ample of the classical masterpieces. 

After the great literatures of modern Europe 
had fairly entered upon their respective lines 
of special national development, they did not 
wholly lose the cosmopolitan character that 
resulted from their common allegiance to the 
empire of classical antiquity. Although their 
cosmopolitanism was not of the alert and com- 
prehensive type that is prevalent to-day. their 
interrelations and mutual reactions form an 
important part of modern literary history. No 
view of English literature can be called philo- 
sophical that does not reckon with the succes- 
sive streams of influences that flowed in upon 
it from Italy, France, and Germany, respect- 
ively. The indebtedness of later Italian litera- 
ture to French example and the catholic atti- 
tude of modern German literature toward all 
that was best in the product of the rest of 
Europe are equally familiar illustrations of 
this thesis. French literature alone remained 
until the eighteenth century in a condition of 
comparative isolation from outside influences, 
and has, ever since the times of Rousseau and 
Voltaire and the author of " De 1' Allemagne," 
preserved its indigenous characteristics and 
kept its own counsel more completely than the 
literature of any other modern nation. 

The singular position thus occupied until 
very recently by French literature has been 
for most French writers a matter of national 
pride. They seem to have taken for granted 



204 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



that French letters could have nothing of seri- 
ous importance to learn from foreign example. 
While they have reluctantly admitted that 
Shakespeare and Goethe might have certain 
merits, and be good enough poets for barba- 
rians, they have held fast to the belief that 
consummate modern literary art was only to 
be found in the French language, and espe- 
cially in the masterpieces of the classical 
eighteenth century. In this comfortable be- 
lief they have been rudely shaken by the oc- 
currences of recent years, for the French pub- 
lic has lately shown an alarming tendency to 
follow after strange foreign gods, and, after 
having for many years repelled the invading 
hordes from the North, seems suddenly to 
have reversed its ancient attitude, now wel- 
coming the invaders with open arms and effu- 
sive cordiality. Thus the question of literary 
cosmopolitanism has become in France not 
merely a living one, but an acutely controver- 
sial one, and the occasion of much eloquent 
exhortation upon both sides. 

Among the recent writers who have dealt 
with this subject, M. Jules Lemaitre was one 
of the first in the field, and the way in which 
he disposed of the whole question was so in- 
geniously absurd that his discussion has re- 
mained memorable. Taking Dr. Ibsen and 
the other Scandinavians for his text, he argued 
that all their ideas were of French origin, and 
that Frenchmen would therefore do much 
better to read the books of their own fellow- 
countrymen ; that, in fact, their only reason 
for liking these foreigners was that they found 
in them the expression of French thought ! 
Somewhat later M. Rene Doumic elaborated 
a similar argument with respect to the Rus- 
sians, whose invasion followed close upon that 
of the Scandinavians. This writer, indeed, 
does not mince his words. He speaks of the 
" undoubted immorality of cosmopolitanism " 
and calls it "the school of anarchy for many 
of the distinguished spirits of our time." It 
has its illuminati, its fanatics, and its con- 
vulsionists. " Behold them in the attacks of 
their delirium, the Tolstoyans, the Ibsenians, 
the Nietzscheans — but above all do not try to 
calm them." While other nations are culti- 
vating the national spirit, France is in danger 
of bringing up " generations of dupes." M. 
Doumic is really very much disturbed. 

As a representative of the other point of 
view the late Joseph Texte is a typical figure. 
This young writer, whose untimely death two 



years ago at the age of thirty-five was a heavy 
loss to French criticism, was an enthusiastic 
champion of the cosmopolitan movement. To 
him it meant freedom from the bondage of the 
classical tradition and safety from the degen- 
eracy that results from inbreeding, in literature 
no less than in life. His formula for the na- 
tion as well as for the individual was rester 
soi-meme et pourtant s'unir aux autres. He 
believed cosmopolitanism to be a necessary 
trait of every forceful intellect in the present 
age of thought, and foresaw the growth of a 
real solidarity among men through the agency 
of letters. This doctrine he preached and this 
he applied in his studies of comparative liter- 
ature, although remaining essentially conser- 
vative in temper, and insisting that the French 
people, no matter how far its new interests 
may take it afield, must not allow the heredi- 
tary qualities of its genius to become weakened. 
Whether this be a possible ideal or not the 
future alone can show. It is certainly an ideal 
toward which much of the best French thought 
is tending, in common with the advanced 
thought of all the other nations of literary 
importance. 

That the spirit of cosmopolitanism is des- 
tined to influence, if not to control, the future 
development of the leading literatures of the 
world is one of the clearest signs of the times. 
In its recent conquest of the French it has cap- 
tured the last outpost of the resistance offered 
in the name of national genius and racial unity. 
No people henceforth will be free to live unto 
itself in the forms and ideals of its literary ex- 
pression, or to contemn the works of the alien. 
Despite the occasional aberrations of taste and 
extravagances of enthusiasm that may accom- 
pany the new habit of looking abroad for the 
fresh inspiration or the fertilizing thought, the 
current now sets everywhere too strongly in the 
direction of intellectual free trade to be in 
danger of checks or reverses. For good or for 
evil — and we need hardly say that we hold it for 
good — the world is fast growing one in spirit, 
and this at a time when, as never before, the 
instinct of race is asserting itself as a force 
in the shaping of polities, and the arousing, 
among men of the same stock, of a common 
consciousness of their own distinctive char- 
acter. In a word, the formula of taste is being 
fulfilled before our very eyes in the combined 
literary, social, and political movement of the 
present day among the chief peoples of our 
modern world.

Remixiscences of an Octogenarian.* 



No straightforward account of a life devoted 
to noble ends can fail of being noteworthy 
and helpful. Dr. Cuyler's recollections of a 
life that has been both long and broad are as 
uplifting as they are interesting. 

Aurora, N. Y., was his birthplace, Princeton 
gave him his education, both academic and 
theological, and Brooklyn has been the chief 
field of his pastoral labors. But no parochial 
boundaries or sectarian dividing lines limit his 
influence and repute as preacher and writer. 
Extensive travel and intercourse with many 
men have broadened and enriched his life, so 
that what he now o£fers us, in his modest little 
volume of reminiscences of an octogenarian, is 
the more valuable because of the still greater 
wealth it suggests as held in reserve. 

What most impresses us in Dr. Cuyler is 
the admirable union of conservatism and pro- 
gressiveness. Distrustful of the " new the- 
ology " and the " higher criticism," he yet 
braves the displeasure of the Brooklyn Pres- 
bytery by ipviting a Quakeress to deliver a 
religious address from his pulpit — and that, 
be it added, was thirty years ago. A letter 
written to him by the late President Harrison 
shows our author to be as staunch an anti- 
imperialist as his correspondent. In matters 
literary, he says a wise word in praise of our 
past and in deprecation of that lessening devo- 
tion to the ideal that marks an era of exuber- 
ant material prosperity. An enthusiastic ad- 
vocate of temperance and a tireless laborer in 
its cause, he nevertheless would carry legisla- 
tive prohibition no further than what is known 
as local option. " In theory," he says, " I 
always have been, and am to-day, a legal sup- 
pressionist ; but the most vital remedy of all 
is to break up the demand for intoxicants, and 
to persuade people from wishing to buy and 
drink them. That goes to the root of the evil." 

Dr. Cuyler first visited Europe just after leav- 
ing college. As he is one of the few now living 
who have seen and talked with Wordsworth, 
his account of a visit to Eydal Mount is worth 
quoting from. 

" I was shown, at once, into the sittiDg-room,' where 
I found him with his wife, who sat sewing beside him. 
The old man rose and received me graciously. By his

appearance I was somewhat startled. Instead of a 
grave recluse in scholastic black, whom I expected to 
gee, I found an affable and lovable old man dressed in 
the roughest coat of blue with metal buttons, and 
checked trousers, more like a New York farmer than 
an English poet. His nose was very large, his forehead 
a lofty dome of thought, and his long white locks hung 
over his stooping shoulders; his eyes presented a singu- 
lar, half closed appearance. We entered at once into 
a delightful conversation. He made many inquiries 
about Irving, Mrs. Sigourney and our other American 
authors, and spoke, with g^at vehemence, in favor of 
an international copyright law. He said that at one 
time he had hoped to visit America, but the duties of 
a small ofQce which he held (Distributer of Stamps), 
and upon which he was partly dependent, prevented 
the undertaking." 

From his reminiscences of Dean Stanley 
we select the following, which has reference to 
the Dean's visit to America in 1878 : 

" When we entered the elevated railroad car, Stanley 
exclaimed : ' This is like the chariots on the walls of 
Babylon.' With his keen interest in history he inquired 
when we reached the lower part of the Bowery, near 
the junction of Chatham Square : < Was it not here 
that Nathan Hale, the martyr, was executed ? ' and he 
showed then a more accurate knowledge of our local 
history than one New Yorker in ten thousand can 
boast I That was probably the exact locality, and 
Dean Stanley had never been there before." 

With Spurgeon he was on the friendliest of 
terms. 

"Spurgeon's power lay in a combination of half a 
dozen great qualities. He was the master of a vigorous 
Saxon English style, the style of Cobbett and Bunyan 
and the old English Bible. He possessed a most mar- 
velous memory — it held the whole Bible in solution ; 
it retained all the valuable truth he had acquired during 
his immensely wide readings and it enabled him to rec- 
ognize any person whom he ever met before. Once, 
however, be met for the second time a Mr. Patridge 
and called him 'Partridge.' Quick as a flash he said: 
< Pardon me, sir, I did not intend to make game of 
yon.' " 

Sydney Smith's tribute to Daniel Webster's 
commanding appearance is historic. " That 
man," he declared, " is a fraud ; for it is im- 
possible for anyone to be as great as he looks." 
Dr. Cuyler is equally unrestrained in his ad- 
miration. 

" In the days of my boyhood the most colossal figure, 
physically and intellectually, in American politics, was 
Daniel Webster. I well remember when I first put eye 
npon him. It was when I was pursuing my studies in 
the New York University Grammar School in prepara- 
tion for Princeton College. I was strolling one day on 
the Battery, and met a friend who said to me : ' Yonder 
goes Daniel I Webster; he has just landed from that 
man-of-war; go and get a good look at him.' I hastened 
my steps and, as I came near him, I was as much awe- 
striken as if I had been gazing on Bunker Hill Monu- 
ment. He was unquestionably the most majestic speci- 
men of manhood that ever trod this continent. Carlyle 
called him ■ The Great Norseman,' and said that his

eyes were like great anthracite furnaces that needed 
blowing up. Coal heavers in London stopped to stare 
at him as he stalked by. . . . His complexion was a 
swarthy brown. He used to say that while his hand- 
some brother Ezekiel was very fair, he ' had all the 
soot of the family in his face.' Such a mountain of a 
brow I have never seen before or since." 

A walk with Whittier is thus recalled : 
" On the way I told him that not long before, wnen 
I quoted a verse of Bryant's to Horace Greeley, Mr. 
Greeley replied : ' Bryant is all very well, but by far 
the greatest poet this country has produced is John 
Greenleaf Whittier.' ' Did our friend Horace say that? ' 
meekly inquired Whittier, and a smile of satisfaction 
flowed over bis Quaker countenance. The man is not 
born yet who does not like an honest compliment, 
especially if it comes from a high quarter." 

One more citation. In the darkest period 
of the Civil War our autobiographer, in com- 
pany with his mother, called upon President 
Lincoln. 

" We entered the room in which the Cabinet usually 
met — and there, before the fire, stood the tall, gaunt 
form attired in a seedy frock-coat, with his long hair 
unkempt, and his thin face the very picture of distress. 
' How is Mrs. Lincoln? ' inquired my mother. ' Oh,' 
said the President, < I have not seen her since seven 
o'clock this morning; Tad, how is your mother ? ' ' She 
is pretty well,' replied the little fellow, who was coiled 
up then in an arm chair. . . . We spent but a few 
minutes with Mr. Lincoln, and when we came out my 
mother exclaimed : < Oh, what a cruelty to keep that 
man here ! Did you ever see such a sad face in your 
life?'" 

In 1890, after forty-four years in the min- 
istry, and at the close of a thirty-years pastorate 
at the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church 
of Brooklyn, Dr. Cuyler resigned his charge. 
He had built up the church to a membership 
of two thousand three hundred and thirty — 
the third largest in the United States. A few 
closing words on the methods that led to such 
success as a preacher and pastor may not be 
out of place. Earnestness was with him the 
prime essential. His sermon, too, was always 
an outgrowth from his text ; his text was not 
a cap clapped on to a written discourse at the 
last minute. " Preach my word " he took in 
its literal sense. " When a passage from the 
Holy Scripture," he says, "has been planted 
as a root and well watered with prayer, the 
sermon should spring naturally from it." No 
time was spent by him in propping up the 
Cross ; it was all needed for pointing sinners 
to it. " I never have wasted a single minute 
in defending God's Word in my pulpit," he 
declares. " God will take care of His Word 
if we ministers only take care to preach it." 
Dr. Cuyler is in favor of the written sermon, 
though admitting that no hard and fast rule 



can be laid down to cover all cases. He says 
that " Dr. Chalmers read every line of his ser- 
mons with thrilling effect. So did Dr. Charles 
Wadsworth in Philadelphia, and so did Phil- 
lips Brooks in Boston." Surely that was a 
curious kind of reading that poured in such 
a torrent of seemingly impromptu eloquence 
from Trinity pulpit. But Dr. Allen, in his 
recent life of Bishop Brooks, describes him as 
writing out his sermons with the greatest care 
— at least in his early career. Beecher, too, 
is cited by Dr. Cuyler as one who has been 
mistakenly regarded as an extemporaneous 
preacher. " He prepared most of his dis- 
courses carefully, and full one-half of many of 
them were written out." The minister should 
not dissipate his energies, says our author. 
His place is in his pulpit and in the homes of 
his parishioners ; general reform movements 
must not be allowed to engross his attention. 
As to the minister's wife, her true place is in 
her home, as the mother of her family ; here 
is her sphere of highest usefulness. 

The book's too frequent instances of care- 
less workmanship (largely printer's errors, 
probably) call for critical disapprobation — 
amid so much that is irreproachable. Perhaps 
the most annoying to the author will be the 
designation of his writings as lubrications ; 
but we laid down and Champs des Mars are 
almost as bad, and less easily attributable to 
the imp of the types.

Two Rival, Contestants for a 
Continent.* 



The fall of Quebec has often been consid- 
ered by students of American history as the 
proper date of beginning of the United States ; 
for the result of the famous movement of 
Wolfe up the Heights of Abraham was that 
the menace of the ancient French foe upon the 
border was removed, and the colonists, left 
comparatively free from danger, gave them- 
selves up to thoughts for their own political 
and social advancement. The oft-quoted state- 
ment of Choiseul, that he had ceded New 
France to England since they were so fond of 
American dominion and he wanted them to 
have plenty of it, was but one of several ex- 
pressions which indicated that men of foresight 
felt that a new nation was certain to develop in

the western world. The American Revolntion 
was a direct result of the change in ownership 
of North America, and the attempt of the 
mother country to provide for the expenses of 
the war by securing revenue from the colonies, 
which, it felt, had been benefitted by the out- 
come of the war. led to the series of measures 
which culminated finally in the Declaration of 
Independence. 

This phase of American history has been 
emphasized so often by writers as to become 
familiar to everyone, but the history of those 
days when New France and New England ex- 
isted side by side in America has not been so 
well known. Indeed, there has always been a 
tendency to hasten over this period and to sum- 
marize, in connection with the ending of New 
France, the whole history of the years between 
the founding of Jamestown and 1763. It is 
an interesting thing to recall that Champlain, 
upon the St. Lawrence and under the flag of 
France, Hudson on the river which bears his 
name and under the flag of Holland, and the 
Jamestown settlers under the English banner, 
were active at the same time ; the years 1607, 
1608, and 1609 being the period when these 
three nations were contending for a foothold 
on American soil. 

It was the purpose of the late John Fiske 
to complete his notable series of historical 
writings by a volume which should fit in 
between " The Dutch and Quaker Colonies in 
America" and "The American Revolution." 
In connection with a description of the scope 
of the volume first named Mr. Fiske wrote : 

" It is mv purpose, in mv next book, to deal with the 
rise and fall of New France and the development of 
the English colonies as influenced bv the prolonged 
struggle with that troublesome and dangerous neigh- 
bonr. With this end in view, the history of New En- 
gland must be taken up where the earlier book dropped 
it, and the history of New York resumed at about the 
same time, while by degrees we shall find the histories 
of Pennsylvania and the colonies to the south of it swept 
into the main stream of Continental history. That book 
will come down to the year 1765, which witnessed the 
ringing out of the old and the ringing in of the new, — 
the one with Pontiac's War, the other with the Stamp 
Act. I hope to have it ready in about two years from 
now." 

The much-regretted death of the author pre- 
vented him from giving to the present work 
that careful and final revision which marked 
his other writings previous to their publication. 
The subject-matter was largely formulated as 
lectures before the Lowell Institute in Boston, 
and, in the case of one or two chapters, as 
lectures given in other parts of the country. 



Only the first two chapters of the book, cover- 
ing the early history of New France, from 
Cartier to Champlain's accidental arousing of 
the enmity of the Iroquois, were definitely 
prepared for the press. The third chapter, 
continuing the hbtory of New France from 
1610 to the time of Sir Thomas Temple, was 
not completed by Mr. Fiske, bat has been 
finished by another hand. The remaining 
chapters, while in the form of carefully pre- 
pared lectures, were not enriched by the abun- 
dant side-notes and annotations which have 
been features of Mr. Fiske's other historical 
writings. Here again another hand has at- 
tempted to supply some of the matter which 
the author himself might have added. But 
the reader misses in many places those skilful 
touches which have perfected so many of Mr. 
Fiske's rounded sentences. The description of 
the taking of Louisburg, for instance, or that 
of Braddoek"s Defeat, or of the Fall of Quebec, 
had hardly reached final form. One feels too 
that the long chapter on " Witchcraft in Salem 
Village," and the shorter one on " The Great 
Awakening," the two making nearly a third 
of the text, occupy more space relatively than 
would have been the case had Mr. Fiske lived 
to revise the work. Apart from this criticism, 
the chapters mentioned are very interesting, 
and show well the author's characteristics as a 
thinker and writer. 

The title, " New France and New England," 
suggests a contemporaneous development in 
America of two distinct forces. In the work- 
ing out of the plan it was, of course, easier to 
describe the history of New France than that 
of New England. The former practically be- 
gan with Cartier in 1524, and ended with the 
Treaty of 1763, — a compact period of time. 
The impelling ideas of colonization, the char- 
acter of the population, the policies of the 
mother country, the misgovernment of the 
provinces, and the final catastrophe, are facts 
pretty clearly established. New France had its 
day and then passed from sight. 

In the case of New England the period is 
bat one part in the chain of events in the his- 
tory of the incipient L^nited States, and judg- 
ments of men and of events naturally differ 
from those formed in connection with a finished 
career. Considering this phase of the writing, 
the salient features of colonial history and the 
leading characters find satisfactory treatment. 
Due credit is given to the energetic Scotch- 
Irish and German pioneers for their notable 
achievements in pushing westward the sinuous

line of settlement, and the interplay of various 
felements in the struggle for the mastery of the 
continent is well set forth. Perhaps nowhere 
else is to be found in condensed and compact 
form the essential and the striking in the his- 
tory of the old French and Indian wars. 

While, therefore, the volume lacks much of 
that which it certainly would have contained 
had Mr. Fiske been able to give to it the 
thoughtful care which he gave to the other 
books in the series, it will be hailed with much 
satisfaction by the thousands of his friends who 
have followed him with delight as he has re- 
counted the story of America's development.

Mb. Bryce on thb Problems of Race." 

The recent Oxford lecture on "The Eela- 
tions of the Advanced and Backward Races of 
Mankind," by Mr. James Bryce, whom all 
Americans have come to know and esteem as 
the author of " The American Commonwealth," 
has already set the sociological world agog. 
Although Mr. Bryce has brought forth little 
that is new as to the relations of diverse races, 
yet he has given perhaps the clearest and most 
comprehensive utterance on the subject of any 
authority of his eminence. The treatment, be- 
ing limited to the compass of a single lecture, 
is concise and thematic. One could wish that 
the author might yet find time to expand this 
definitely limited deliverance into a big book 
which alone is adequate to so big a subject. 

After briefly pointing out the historic con- 
tact of races, Mr. Bryce tells us that " Our 
own time stands eminent and peculiar for this : 
that it marks the completion of a process by 
which all the races of the world have been 
affected, and all the backward ones placed in 
a more or less complete dependence upon the 
advanced." There is no undoing what has 
already been done. To the historic motives 
influencing race contact there have been added 
two new ones, viz., " The desire of civilized 
producers of goods to secure savage or semi- 
civilized consumers by annexing regions they 
inhabit, and the rivalry of great civilized 
states." 

Our ears are so accustomed to moral cant and 
pious platitude, whenever a strong race would

exploit a weak one, that this frank and candid 
statement is indeed refreshing. Throughout 
the whole lecture one finds little or nothing 
placed to the credit of " benevolent assimila- 
tion." " The completion of this world-process 
is a specially great and fateful event, because 
it closes a page forever." This sentence is 
heavily fraught with significance for the future 
of civilization. When the world is placed under 
the dominance of two or three powerful na- 
tions, they will necessarily check or stop spon- 
taneity and independence of development in 
the backward and submerged breeds. These 
will scarcely be permitted to bring forth their 
peculiar contribution to the general sum of 
human culture. What will civilization then 
do for fresh blood and newness of life ? 

The possible outcome of race-contact is an- 
alyzed as (1) the extermination of the weaker 
element ; (2) absorption of the weaker by the 
stronger ; (3) the commingling of the two ; 
and (4) a continuance of separate and the 
independent racial types. It is strange that 
reference was not made to expulsion, some- 
times of the backward, sometimes of the ad- 
vanced race, which is not an unusual means 
of solution. The Jews were expelled from 
Egypt, the whites were driven from Haiti and 
SanDomingo. Indications are not wanting that 
the Anglo-Saxon element will be expelled from 
certain sections of the Southern States known 
as the " Black Belt,", — not, to be sure, vi et 
armis, but by the slow, glacial force of racial 
momentum. Extinction of the weaker race is 
usually preceded by expulsion from the midst 
of the stronger. The red Indian has been 
driven from the eastern portion of the United 
States, and the natives of the oceanic islands 
have first been pushed to the outer verge of 
their native territory before succeeding waves 
of Aryan aggression wiped them off the face 
of the earth. The process is a continuing one. 
" Barbarism is not more pitiless than civiliza- 
tion, even where civilization may wish to spare." 
The red and the oceanic races have faded at 
the first breath of European civilization. To 
use the rather expressive language of Mr. 
Dooley, — they have been " civilized stiff." 
But the black and the yellow races seem to 
possess a tenacity of persistence which does not 
yield to race attrition. 

The first question which one wishes to know 
about the contact of two races is the degree of 
natural antipathy existing between them. The 
author finds this most marked between the 
white and black races. " I have been struck," 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



209 



he says. " by hearing men in the Rocky Monn- 
tains, who would have concealed any infusion 
of Negro blood, mention that their mothers or 
grandmothers were Indians." Just how far 
this preference is due to color, or to other cir- 
cumstances, is not disclosed. The fact that the 
Indian has never been a slave, and that he is a 
rapidly vanishing quantity from the general 
equation, adds a glamor of romance to his 
race ; while the more numerous Negro, with 
his stubborn persistency of type, is aggravat- 
ingly real. Many of the F. F. V.'s of the Old 
Dominion are not ashamed to own a strain of 
the blood of Pocahontas ; but if the race of this 
Indian heroine was as numerous and as trouble- 
some as that of the African, her blood would 
doubtless be held in like disesteem. 

The evils of race conflict, Mr. Bryce con- 
siders inevitable. " These troubles may be 
apprehended, whatever the form of govern- 
ment : for they spring out of the nature of things. 
They will become, in one sense at least, more 
accentuated the more that [the backward") 
race advances in intelligence and knowledge." 
This conclusion is sadly at varianoe with 
the opinion which relies upon education to 
solve the race-problem in the United Sutes. 
Mr. Bryce takes, on the whole, an unfavorable 
view of the effect of cross-breeding of wide 
apart ethnic types. Where the races are not 
assimilable, as in the United States, the author 
would minimize the evil of contact by giving 
to the backward race '• all such private civil 
rights as it can use to its own benefit." But 
who is to be the judge ? No slaveholder would 
claim that he did less. It has been said by a 
wise man of recent times that no one is good 
enough to be intrusted with the liberty of an- 
other. Can one race ever be a fair and impar- 
tial judge of the feelings and aspirations of 
another, and of its ability to utilize civil priv- 
ileges? Political privilege should not, it is 
affirmed, be based upon race and blood, but 
upon some fair test which applies alike to all, 
although it might exclude the bulk of the 
backward race. 

The subject of social relations is settled by 
Mr. Bryce in a single sentence : " Good feel- 
ings and good manners cannot be imposed by 
a statute." Among the contingencies which 
may affect the future relations of the race are 
mentioned the advance in biological and med- 
ical knowledge, and in mechanical appliances, 
which may be expected to open up new regions 
to European residence. 

The intellectual and moral progress of the 



backward race is also fraught with great sig- 
nificance for the future. " The difference be- 
tween them and the advanced races lies not 
so much in intelligence as in force of will and 
tenacity of purpose. How far these latter 
qualities can be developed with a developing 
intellect is still doubtful, for the future will 
bring new opportunities." The changes that 
may take place in the religious world are also 
supposed to have much determining influence 
npon the future relations of races. The author 
states that religious sanction is less strong 
than the bond of blood, although his argu- 
ments and citations persuade the reader to the 
opposite conclusion. When Jesus was chided 
for his seeming indifference toward his own 
kindred, he responded: "Who is my mother 
and who are my brethren? For whosoever 
shall do the will of my father which is in 
heaven, the same is my brother and sister and 
mother." Religion can command or forbid the 
mixture of races, and this will be done, as the 
case of .Judaism on the one hand, and of 
Mohammedanism on the other, clearly show. 
The superiority of Mohammedanism to Chris- 
tianity and of the Catholic to the Protestant 
sect, in their control over the rancour of race, 
is acknowledged. The author asks : " Can one 
of these causes be that Christianity achieves 
less because it aims at more ?" Then, answer- 
ing his own question, he adds : " Christians, 
of course with many noble exceptions, have 
failed to rise to the level of the higher teach- 
ings, while Moslems have risen to the level of 
the lower." And yet the teaching of the two 
religions is identiciil as respects the treatment 
of those who are of the same household of faith. 
If one might so speak, it might be aptly said 
that in case of the Protestant, he has his re- 
ligion ; whereas in the case of the Catholic, and 
especially the Moslem, his religion has him. 
Therefore we may expect from the latter a 
closer adherence to the requirements of the 
colt. 

" Conceive," suggests our author. " what a 
difference it might make if Islam were, within 
two centuries, to disappear from the earth!** 
If we may be permitted to indulge the imagina- 
tion a little further, let us conceive what a dif- 
ference it might make if within that period 
some new Martin Luther were to arise who 
should substitute for the ancient motto about 
the vital power of personal faith another bear- 
ing more directly upon the prevailing apostasy 
from the teaching of the great head of the 
church, to wit : " There is neither Greek nor

Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barba- 
rian nor Scythian, bond nor free ; but Christ is 
all and in all." Suppose, also, that this reformer 
should be as potent and persuasive over the 
Christian world as was his Teutonic prototype. 
Can we not readily see what an effect such a 
propaganda might have upon the relations of 
the various peoples and tongues? 

Mr. Bryce's final word leaves us balanced 
between hope and fear, with hope slightly in 
the ascendancy. 

"It is a process which has now entered a critical 
phase, and we see before us long vistas in which there 
appear possibilities of an immense increase in the pro- 
ductive powers of earth and man, possibilities also of 
trouble and strife between races now being brought 
into closer and more general contact. As always, ele- 
ments of peril are balanced by elements of hope. The 
sentiment of race pride, the keenness of race rivalry, 
have been intensified. But the sense of a common 
humanity has grown stronger. When we think of the 
problems which are being raised by the contact of 
races, clouds seem to hang heavy on the horizon of the 
future; yet light streams in when we remember that 
the spirit in which civilized states are preparing to 
meet those problems is higher and purer than it was, 
when, four centuries ago, the great outward movement 
of European peoples began."

Some Musical Intimacies.* 



Out of an extended musical experience and 
much browsing in his own extensive musical 
library, Mr. George P. Upton has written a 
series of little essays, ten in number, which 
might very well bear the title of " Musical 
Intimacies," instead of the " Musical Pastels " 
chosen for it. One thinks of pastels as misty 
in outline, not fixed in material, and devoted 
to light and genial topics not wholly serious 
and yet never wholly whimsical ; and nothing 
could be further from describing the papers 
in this interesting book. Mr. Upton is earnest 
and virile in both his choice of themes and his 
treatment of them. His pictures are drawn 
with a firmness and a freedom that suggest 
the charcoal sketch, rather than the pastel. 
And so thoroughly informed is he, and so 
clearly within his own chosen field of knowl- 
edge, that his book has more than ordinary 
promise of becoming a permanent contribu- 
tion to its class of literature. 

In style and treatment the volume is remin- 
iscent of Mr. Upton's earlier work, " Woman 

• Musical Pastels. By George P. Upton. Illustrated. 
Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co, 



in Music," but with the differences that a 
wider outlook and a broader subject, or series 
of subjects, permit. His choice is catholic, 
ranging down to the living present from the 
initial essay on " Nero the Artist," in which 
the modern view that sees something more in 
the Koman emperor than a summing up of all 
the iniquities finds full expression ; as when 
the story of Nero's fiddling while Rome burned 
is commented on thus : 

" If Nero bad been musically inclined at such a time, 
he would have been the artist, and sung to the accom- 
paniment of his cithara some stirring psean, while 
stately palaces and temples of the gods were < in one 
red burial blent.' . . . Nero's efforts to stay its [the 
fire's] progress, to alleviate the distress caused by it, 
and to restore the waste places by building them up 
more splendidly than before, are of themselves suffi- 
cient to acquit him of the charge of incendiarism ; but, 
nevertheless, he will be held responsible through all 
coming ages for the burning of Rome, as well as for 
the added indecorum of fiddling on the top of his tower 
— though there were no 'fiddles' at that time, and 
though Nero antedated his tower by more than two 
centuries. But if Nero sang the ' Ruin of Troy ' in 
the midst of the conflagration, it was his last public 
musical performance, and thus he literally ended his 
artistic career in a ' blaze of glory.' " 

A gossippy account of "The Musical Small- 
Coals Man," Thomas Britton (1654-1714), 
follows ; and then we are given a sympathetic 
and liberal interpretation of the religious hold- 
ings of Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and 
Beethoven, under the title of " Music and 
Religion." Turning then to our own country, 
Mr. Upton has more than a few pleasant things 
to say of "The First American Composer," 
William Billings of Boston, who first " de- 
clared American musical independence " in 
" The New England Psalm Singer " in Octo- 
ber, 1770, his title-page containing the follow- 
ing invitation to the world : 

"O, praise the Lord with one consent. 
And in this grand design 
Let Britain and the Colonies 
Unanimously jine." 

Mr. Upton goes on to say : 

" It is a far cry from the twentieth century back to 
the days of Billings, but there are still ears to be tickled 
and composers to tickle them. With all his love of 
sacred music and his apparent reverential feeling, he

in all its forms," the book goes back to "The 
First Opera," written by Ottavio Einnccini and 
Jacopo Peri and performed upon the occasion 
of the marriage of Maria de' Medici to Henry 
IV. of France, in the year 1600, being the first 
public performance of any opera. It is char- 
acterized thus : 

" It was a little band compared with those which 
accompany opera in the twentieth century. It was a 
modest array of singers compared with the tenors, 
baritones, bassos and prime donne of the troupes of to- 
day. The music was crude and harsh and monotonous 
as compared with the scores of the present time; but 
the beginnings of all this twentieth century operatic 
magnificence were contained in the music to which 
Henry IV. and his ungracious queen listened on their 
wedding day, as the beginnings of the oak are con- 
tained in the acorn; and though the full meaning of 
their great discovery may not have dawned upon Peri, 
Rinucciui, and their Florentine associates who had 
worked out the problem together at the Palazzo Corsi, 
they knew they had created a new dramatic form in 
music. A little later, Monteverde, the Duke of 
Mantua's chapel-master, realized the possibilities latent 
in < Euridice,' and proceeding upon the lines laid down 
by Peri, still further developed the form; but to 
Jacopo Peri belongs the honor of the title, ' Father of 
the Opera.'" 

One of the most amusing chapters in the 
book is that headed with the Virgil ian quota- 
tion ending ^^Tanttene animis ca^lestibus tree?" 
and entitled " Some Musical Controversies." It 
is finely inclusive, opening with the celebrated 
quarrel between the Italian and French expos- 
itors of the Gregorian chant in the days of 
Charlemagne, and coming down to Wagner. 
One of the episodes has its scene in London, 
when the town was split between the followers 
of Cuzzoni and of Bordoni, rival prime donne. 
It was of Handel, kept in the hottest of water 
by the disputatious rivals under his direction, 
that this classical incident is narrated : 

•« Upon one occasion Cuzzoni refused to sing an aria 
in his ' Otho ' because it did not suit her. The en- 
raged composer turned upon her and said: 'I know, 
madame, that you are a very devil ; but I will let you 
see that I am Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.' 
Suiting the action to the word, he seized her around 
the waist and threatened to throw her through the 
window if she did not sing it. Terrified at his rage, 
she consented, and made a great hit with the aria." 

The quarrels between LuUy and Ramean 
and their respective adherents in France in 
the seventeenth century, of Piccinni and 
Gluck somewhat later, of Mozart and Rossini 
later still, and last of Wagner with what was 
at first the world at large, are entertaining. 
Few have descended to the expedient by which 
the enemies of Gluck gave a dinner with an 
overflow of wine to Mile. La Guerre, just be- 
fore she was to appear in the title role of one 



of his greatest compositions at its first pro- 
duction, — leading a witty spectator to remark 
that " She was not Iphigenia en Tauride, but 
Iphigenia en Champagne." Yet worse things 
were said, if not done, concerning Richard 
Wagner, and the sentences about to be quoted 
should have a restraining effect upon too acrid 
critics : 

<* In England, where Mendelssohn was an idol, the 
' Athenaeum ' pronounced him [Wagner] < a charlatan,' 
and his music 'impious, profligate, and nauseating.' 
The ' Times ' spoke of him as a man whom ' it would be 
a scandal to compare with the men of reputation this 
country possesses, and whom the most ordinary ballad- 
writers would shame in the creation of melody, and of 
whose harmony no English harmonist could be found 
sufficiently without ears or education to pen such vile 
things.' " 

With the desultoriness which is not the 
least of the book's many engaging qualities, 
Mr. Upton takes his readers back to " A 
Musical Royal Family," the one worthiest the 
name in history, and surprises more than one 
widely-read man with the announcement that 
it was made up of Henry VIII. of England, 
Anne Boleyn his queen, and the three royal 
children, Edward, sixth of that name, Mary, 
and Elizabeth. All were accomplished musi- 
cians in a day which culminated, as we are 
reminded, with " The reign of Elizabeth, . . . 
the Augustan era of music in England ; and 
its glories have not been surpassed by those 
of any succeeding age." And what is rightly 
called " a very pretty story " is told of the Vir- 
gin Queen when she was still a virgin princess. 
" During Mary's reign she had little opportunity for 
amusement. She was sometimes suffered to walk in 
the palace garden at Woodstock. Upon one of these 
occasions she heard a milkmaid singing cheerily, and 
wished she were one, for ' her case is better and her 
life is merrier.' May not Shakespeare have had this 
story in mind when writing Henry the Sixth's battle 
soliloquy: 

" ' O God ! methinks it were a happy life, 
To be DO better than a homely swain ; 
To sit upon a bill, as I do now. 
To earre out dials quaintly, point by point, 
Thereby to see the miontes how they run.' " 

" Bullfinch and Nightingale," the names of 
the two songsters having been applied to two 
collections of ballads and their music, one 
British and the other American, affords the 
commentator an opportunity to give a little 
history of English balladry from the musical 
rather than the literary point of view, his own 
copy of "The Bullfinch" having been the 
property of Dorothy Wordsworth. Passing 
from the " Chloes, Florindas, and Daphnes " 
of the English to the " Nannies, Peggies, and 
Emmas " of the American book, one alights

upon a chorus which makes him long for the 
verses. 

"Five hundred fops, with shrugs and hops, 
And leers, and smiles and smirkings. 
Most willing she would leave for me — 
Oh ! what a Peggy Perkins." 

The volume closes with a consideration of 
" The Man Beethoven," an admirable summary 
of a great career, equally removed from adula- 
tion and acidulation. There is a precis from 
the great master's diary concerning domestic 
servants which has a curiously familiar ring ; 
and one may have a choice of descriptions of 
the manner of the man. 

" Schlosser, a friend, says: 'A student of human na- 
ture could tell at a glance that he was in the presence 
of a genius. Beethoven's gait was firm; a peculiar 
expression lingered round his lips; the eyes shone with 
extraordinary depth of sentiment, and majestic creative 
power sat enthroned upon his forehead.' Frau von 
Bernhard, an acquaintance, who met him in Vienna, on 
the other hand, says: < He is short and insignificant 
looking, with a red face. His general bearing shows 
no signs of culture, and his behavior is very unmannerly. 
He is very proud.' " 

Mr. Upton corrects the statement made in his 
" Woman in Music," where he held that 
Beethoven's beloved was the Countess Guic- 
ciardi, by saying, " More recent investigations 
have established beyond much doubt that the 
[love] letters were addressed to the Countess 
Teresa von Brunswick." 

The book is most suitably illustrated by re- 
productions of old plates, many of them por- 
traits of the celebrities mentioned ; and it is 
admirably printed on good paper, and fittingly 
bound. But one question must remain in the 
reader's mind as he comes to the end of the 
volume : When Mr. Upton can write so accept- 
ably, why does he write so little?

A Bibliography of American Histort.* 



For ten years Mr. George lies has been 
advocating, before the American Library As- 
sociation and elsewhere, a plan for a systematic 
appraisal of all literature by specialists in its 
various departments. The plan requires that 
competent critics shall provide for all avail- 
able books a sort of museum description, which 
shall indicate their strong and weak points and 
sum up their general value, in order that the 
librarian may have at hand a convenient guide 
to assist him in purchasing books and answer- 

•The Literature op American History. A Biblio- 
graphical Guide. Edited for the American Library Associa- 
tion by J. N. Lamed. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



ing questions and that the public may in their 
reading have some means of distinguishing the 
wheat from the chaff. 

Manifestly so comprehensive a plan can be 
executed only in sections. After some pre-* 
liminary experiments, Mr. lies made his first 
attempt to cover systematically a distinct field 
of literature by editing some five years ago 
" An Annotated Bibliography of Fine Art " 
prepared by Mr. Russell Sturgis and Mr. 
Henry E. Krehbiel. Subsequently, in order to 
cover a larger field and reach a wider circle of 
readers, he very generously gave the American 
Library Association $10,000 to meet the ex- 
pense of compiling a bibliography of American 
history. The general editorship of the work 
was undertaken without compensation by Mr. 
J. N. Lamed of the Buffalo Public Library. 
Mr. Larned associated with himself some forty 
assistants, most of whom are well known as 
teachers or students in this particular field. 
The result of their labors is the recently- 
published " Literature of American History," 
which presents an annotated list of some four 
thousand titles and comes down to the year 
1900. In order to keep up with current lit- 
erature, it is intended to issue periodically 
supplements which shall cover all later publi- 
cations. 

In view of the multiplicity of books and the 
rapid growth of public libraries, there can be 
little question of the value of the plan. Where 
the doctors disagree, as they are bound to in 
many cases, one opinion may be more mis- 
leading than no opinion at all ; but notwith- 
standing this drawback, the advantages of the 
plan greatly outweigh the objections to it. 
Judgment of the work must therefore turn 
upon the success with which the plan has been 
executed. 

The problem of classification is for the most 
part well solved, but it was a mistake to group 
state histories by sections rather than by states. 
Certain books treating of sections as a whole 
had to be grouped together ; but it is confus- 
ing, in looking for the histories of one state, 
to find them mixed with the histories of a dozen 
others. The inequality of the annotations fur- 
nishes the most evident ground for criticism. 
Many of them are models of condensed and 
accurate statement, others are less satisfactory, 
while some are altogether inadequate. A con- 
siderable proportion consist of extracts from 
reviews in The Dial, The Nation, The Atlantic 
Monthly, The American Historical Review, 
and other similar sources ; these notes are

oommonlj ansatisfaetoiy, not throngh any 
fault of the reviews but because, by taking a 
part from the whole, the effect of the whole is 
lost. In the case of recent books it would 
have been well to have added an appropriate 
note containing references to various reviews, 
in order that the reader might compare con- 
flicting criticisms and form his own conclu- 
sions. 

Mr. Lamed modestly admits that he is not 
a specialist in American history and that he 
lacks the qualifications requisite for the super- 
vision of bibliographical work in it. Under 
these circumstances, we would have expected 
him to assign each section to a competent 
Bpecialist in that section, in order that the 
notes might be made up in groups. To some 
extent this has been done, and always to ad- 
vantage. If the entire work had been more 
thoroughly organized in this way there would 
have been greater uniformity. As it is, the 
notes of most of the contributors are more or 
less scattered over the whole field, with a re- 
salting incongruity that would not have oc- 
curred under more systematic treatment. Take 
for example the page devoted to John Brown : 
the notes are either written by different hands 
or drawn from reviews, so that there is uni- 
formity neither in the treatment nor in the 
point of view. 

The editor forestalls criticism in regard to 
selection and completeness by saying that the 
work is " intended to be neither an exhaustive 
bibliography of American history, nor a mere 
selection of the best books in that department 
of literature. . . . The selective aim in its 
preparation has been to embrace the books of 
every character, good, bad, and indifferent, 
concerning which it seems important that 
readers of various classes should be told what 
their merit or demerit is." That there should 
be some omissions and some slips in so com- 
prehensive a work was unavoidable. For books 
of collected essays, like Chamberlain's " John 
Adams," a table of contents should have been 
given. So useful an introduction as Ruge's 
" Entwickelung der Kartographie von Amer- 
ika," and so monumental a work as Xorden- 
skiold's " Facsimile Atlas," should have been 
included. Reference is made to the abstract 
of Gen. G. K. Warren's memoir in Wheeler's 
Survey, but not to the complete memoir in the 
Pacific Railroad Survey nor to the latter 
Survey. The reader is advised to compare 
Reddaway's " Monroe Doctrine " with De 
Beanmarchais, but the latter is not listed. 



Watson's " Adventures of a Blockade Runner " 
suggests Taylor's "Running the Blockade" 
which is important because its author was the 
principal organizer of the blockade-running 
fleet. Why Olmsted's "Texas" and "Back 
Country " should not be given the same recog- 
nition as his " Seaboard Slave States," or a 
single appraisal be given to the series, is not 
apparent. The " Colonial Tracts " reprinted 
from Force's collection by Mr. G. P. Hum- 
phrey, are listed as if edited by Peter Force 
in person. There is some duplication : Lum- 
mis's " Spanish Pioneers " and Bandelier's 
" Gilded Man " are both twice listed and ap- 
praised. 

But notwithstanding some inequality and 
occasional inaccuracy, the work as a whole will 
be indispensable to librarians and useful to all 
teachers of American history.

Mr. Henry Grey Graham, the author 
of '■ The Social Life of Scotland in 
the Eighteenth Century," has pro- 
ceeded from the general to the particular in his 
handsome new octavo, " Scottish Men of Letters in 
the Eighteenth Century" (Macmillan). That is to 
say, those who appeared in the earlier work inci- 
dentally, and only as indicating general tendencies 
in the great social body, are now brought into the 
foreground, and the social life of the people is 
allowed to appear no more distinctly than a back- 
ground distantly removed. The scene is almost 
always Edinborgh, for those of the Scotch nation 
who had any brains to sell came thither as to their 
sole market, and, once there, returned to it as to 
home from whatsoever place they might have found 
for sojourn in England or France. The volume 
opwns with an account of the dawn of Scotch litera- 
ture in the modem sense of the word, the coming of 
Allan Ramsey being practically coincident with the 
beginning of the century. This worthy divides the 
first chapter with Hamilton of Bangour and Robert 
Blair. Early philosophers, college professors, liter- 
ary judges, Adam Smith the economist, Boewell, 
Beattie, Smollett and his countrymen in England, 
the women balladists, the writers of songs of the 
sterner sex. may be said to lead up to Robert 
Barns, whose checkered career is told with real 
sympathy and comprehension. Henry Mackenzie 
and Du^d Stewart close the account. Authentic 
portraits accompany every biography, but these do 
not lend the value to the work which Mr. Graham's 
nice sense of interpretation by anecdote does, every 
page being animated by something at once indi- 
vidually charaeteristie and wholly and generally

what IS now ot. James s Park and 
the Thames, a little south of Charing Cross. The 
site was in the possession of Hubert (or Hugo) de 
Burgh, in the middle of the thirteenth century, and 
was subsequently annexed by the Archbishop of 
York to his see. Thirty Archbishops in succession 
held it, the last being Cardinal Woolsey. It was 
all this while known as York House. Upon the 
fall of Woolsey, Henry VIII. seized it, and about 
that time the name was changed to Whitehall, 
which seems to have originated in much the same 
way as our name for the official residence of our 
chief magistrate. Whitehall continued to be a royal 
residence until the time of the disastrous fire therein 
in 1698. During the two and a half centuries 
that it was thus used, it was the scene of many 
historic episodes of deep interest, not the least im- 
portant of them being the execution of Charles I.; 
while the architectural vicissitudes to which the 
site has been subjected from the middle of the 
thirteenth century to the present time are of espe- 
cial interest to the historian, the antiquary, and the 
lover of Old London. The Banqueting Hall, built 
by Inigo Jones early in the seventeenth century, is 
all that remains of what was once the Royal Palace 
■of Whitehall. Edgar Sheppard, D.D., being "Sub- 
Dean of H. M. Chapels Royal and Sub-Almoner to 
the King," as well as " author of ' Memorials of St. 
James's Palace'," has had extraordinary facilities 
for collating the materials and for telling in full 
the story of the exceedingly interesting site and the 
buildings that have occupied it. This he has done 
in " The Old Royal Palace of Whitehall " (Long- 
mans), a royal octavo, sumptuous in style as befits 
a volume that is " Dedicated by gracious permission 
to His Majesty the King," and embellished with six 
photogravures (five of them portraits), and thirty- 
three other illustrations. Some of the latter are 
of especial interest, as they present views of the 
buildings occupying the site in the seventeenth, 
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, with an 
admirable ground-plan, and copies of designs fur- 
nished by Inigo Jones for a palace that was to 
cover an area of 1152 by 874 feet, and eclipse the 
Vatican, the Lateran, and the Escurial, — a palace 
of which the Banqueting Hall was only a detail. 



Booker Wathington 
on character 
building. 



Mr. Booker T. Washington's new 
volume entitled " Character Build- 
ing" (Doubleday) is a collection of 
chapel addresses delivered by Mr. Washington to 
the students of Tuskegee Institute. The subject- 
matter consists of a discussion of such homely vir- 
tues and duties as cheerfulness, helpfulness, sim- 
plicity, earnestness, cleanliness, and honesty, in 
some of their neglected applications to every-day 



life. An almost severe simplicity and directness 
of style gives an unsophisticated charm to these 
homely exhortations. There is no hint of affecta- 
tion or of pedantry. Though Mr. Washington puts 
none of his criticisms of the negro in sugar-coated 
rhetoric, no taint of cynicism nor suggestion of con- 
scious superiority appears. If it be objected that 
his messages lack originality, it is enough to say 
that the principal of Tuskegee has here a higher 
motive than the desire to be original. He is striving 
to uplift his race. " That is never too often repeated 
which is not sufficiently learned." Some readers 
may be surprised that these chapel addresses are 
not more directly religious. While it is true that 
the self-conscious type of Christian experience is 
not exploited, still it should be remembered that no 
one could fulfil the ideals so enthusiastically offered 
in this volume without becoming deeply religious. 
A sane optimism pervades every address. The 
negro is far enough from ideal manhood, but it is 
presented as something not beyond his possibilities. 
A noble character challenges strenuous endeavor. 
These helpful and cheering exhortations are incal- 
culably more valuable to the colored people than 
any pious pratings. The charm of Mr. Washing- 
ton's earlier work, "Up from Slavery," is of course 
not to be found in the present volume. In that 
unique autobiography, prosaic maxims and hack- 
neyed precepts are illuminated by the author's suc- 
cessful career; and this interplay of personal expe- 
rience and homely precept gave a subtle charm to 
the autobiography which " Character Building " of 
course does not enjoy. But the same virtues reju- 
venated in " Up from Slavery " are in these ad- 
dresses rescued from dulness by a directness of 
speech and an aptness of illustration which ad- 
mirably suit their character and purpose. The 
volume is to be recommended to all those who 
desire to become better acquainted with the char- 
acter and methods of the principal of Tuskegee, as 
well as to all those who are wise enough to seek 
new incentives in the building of character. 

The making oj After an intimate acquaintance with 
the American the regular army of the United

and the Philippines as a war correspondent, Mr. 
H. Irving Hancock made a visit of several months' 
duration at the national military academy, and his 
instructive book on " Life at West Point " (Put- 
nam) is the result. The sub-title explains the 
character of the work in declaring its purpose to 
be to describe "The Making of the American 
Army Officer, his Studies, Discipline, and Amuse- 
ments," and a semi-official character is given it 
by a brief commendatory introduction by Colonel 
Albert L. Mills, U. S. A., superintendent of the 
academy. The book is voluminously illustrated 
from photographs, and no better account of the 
actualities of life at West Point could have been 
devised. Two reflections come to the reader : 
First, the enormous amount of work, both physical

Now that the holiday-makers are all 
^^^^^^^ *t home or returning, it is a time for 

open-air books. Surely we do not 
need such in Spring, for then our spirit leaps at 
the hint alone of sea or mountains; nor in summer, 
for no one in the company of Nature wants to read 
of Nature ; nor even in winter, for the pleasant 
chimney-corner is certainly warm and satisfying, — 
and why jar upon good comfort? No, the time to 
read such a book as •• The Winding Road" (Holt) is 
now. when the reading is touched with the charm of 
gentle melancholy. There are many who love the 
out-door world : Some are hunters or fishermen ; 
some, artists or scientists ; some, lovers ; some, 
idlers. But there are also the wanderers who love 
the great without-walls because of its freedom. 
They are not to be constrained, even by the bar- 
baric power of rod or gun ; nor do they love Nature 
either to imitate or know. They have simply the 
out-door feeling in them. Other things they often 
do, — hunt, fish, love, paint, know, idle : all of these 
things they may do, but they would be what they 
are did they not. Such was Jasper of our present 
tale ; and it was the wandering instinct that gave 
charm to his life with Phenice, who left the farm to 
follow him, and that in the end gave tragedy. 
Miss Godfrey's book is full of the gypsy spirit, full 
of charm for those who have but a little of such a 
hectic in the blood. We could certainly find some 
fault with it as a novel, — but we shall not, for it 
is rather as a bit of the epic-cycle of the open road 
that we have read it, and as such all lovers of the 
winding way will find it worthy a place beside 
what would be the classics of the wanderers, if it 
were not too much of a bother to carry books, even 
good ones, when one has once left the town behind.

Those who are familiar with the 
,,» , J ,•> . opinion which most of the inhabi- 

et Ike land 0/ ScoU. '^ . 

tants of continental Europe have of 
the British as a whole will read with unholy joy 
Mr. T. W. H. Crosland's indictment of the northern 
half of Britain contained in '*The Unspeakable 
Scot" (Putnam). For he has prepared an indict- 
ment against the Scottish nation, living and dead, 
and all that Scotland holds dear in everything ex- 
cept religion, which most of those who do not like 
England will regard as an attempt to shift a burden 
from her own shoulders upon those of the sister 
kingdom. Mr. Crosland has convinced himself 



that the reason for the present domination of the 
Scotchman in imperial affairs is due to no positiTB 
merit on his part, but only to the preoccupation 
and lethargy of the real Englishman. If this were 
true, it must still appear that the worse the case is 
made for Scotland the more profound the reflection 
cast upon England. But the book is not one to be 
taken too seriously at any point. It succeeds in 
making out its case by irony at the expense of the 
enthusiasts, so far as it makes any case at all. The 
Scottish love for Robert Burns, which is quite as 
extreme as the Englishman's reverence for Shake- 
speare, is easily brought to ridicule by selecting 
some of the most obnoxious of Bums's rhymes for 
quotation, — much as Mr. Swinburne sought to 
moderate a too inclusive worship of Shakespeare 
by a similar device. Americans, accustomed through 
several generations to see foreigners of all sorts in 
positions of power, have lost the provincial attitude 
toward those of another nation which makes Mr. 
Crosland's book possible. Perhaps " parochial " is 
even a better word than " provincial " here. 

Probably no one is better qualified 
T^»f^''m than Mr. R. G. Thwaites to under- 

take a biography of Father Mar- 
quette, the Jesuit explorer of the Mississippi. For 
after all is brought together that may be, we are 
almost absolutely dependent for oar knowledge on 
the " Jesuit Relations," in editing which Mr. 
Thwaites has deserved so well of patriotic Ameri- 
cans concerned for the minutest details of their 
country's history. However treated, the life of an 
early American missionary cannot fail to be inter- 
esting ; and this biography has the advantage of all 
of its kind. Yet on the whole, aside from the explor- 
ing voyages on the Mississippi and its tributaries, 
it is a simple, uneventful life, and considerable 
effort was necessary to fill out the 250 pages as- 
signed by the standard of " Appletons' Historic Lives 
Series," to which the volume belongs. This effort 
becomes quite obvious when the author, despite the 
paucity of knowledge regarding Marquette's youth 
and family circumstances, recites the historical 
vicissitudes of his native city of Laon from the 
Roman times down. It is felt also in the large 
space given to imaginary details of voyages and the 
considerable extracts from accounts of general mis- 
sionary life. Subtract these, and what remains would 
not be much more in bulk than the biographies of 
Sparks and Shea. Nevertheless, it is worth while 
to have this life in the honest and simple relation 
of one who knows at least all that is worth knowing 

on the subject.

lifetime, to leave an impression of mellowness and 
contentment rare in the annals of literature. Mr. 
Black had many friends (among whom his biog- 
rapher was one of the nearest), and although be 
passed away just at the close of his fifty-seventh 
year, having been long an invalid, these made even 
his last hours far more happy than the best of 
some men's entire lives. Naturally, writing about 
such a personality, so circumstanced, the present 
biographer had a congenial and pious task in hand ; 
and he has discharged it with full sympathy and 
understanding. Many letters of the novelist en- 
liven his pages, — for Black was quite as much a 
master of correspondence as of fiction ; and these 
are supplemented by many delightful letters in 
return from the best-known men of his day. An 
excellent likeness of Black serves for frontispiece, 
and a complete index rounds out a book which can 
be studied by the writers of the coming generation 
with pleasure and profit, while it serves to bring 
many delightful things to the minds of their elders. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In one of the daintiest of volumes, published in this 
country by the Messrs. Putnam, an unnamed editor has 
collected with taste and discrimination something like 
four score " Songs of England's Glory." Most of the 
old favorites are here, and also a number of modern 
pieces less familiarly known, but deserving of places 
in such a collection. We regret the omission of Mr. 
Swinburne's ode on the defeat of the Armada, which is 
worth a hundred of the two Armada poems included, 
but perhaps copyright reasons stood in the way. 

Mr. Horace White's " Money and Banking," which 
was first published seven years ago, has been issued in 
a second edition by Messrs. Ginn & Co. Considerable 
alterations have been made in the text, which no longer 
needs to be as controversial as when " free silver " was 
an actual political menace to our institutions, and the 
work in its present form is expressly rearranged as a 
teaching manual, being provided for that purpose with 
summaries and lists of authorities. There are several 
new chapters, and the work is distinctly more valuable 
than it was in its earlier form. The student of Amer- 
ican monetary affairs can find no more interesting and 
competent guide to the subject than is offered by this 
admirable volume. 

Mr. George P. Upton's musical handbooks have long 
been valued by the concert-goer and the lover of opera. 
They furnish in compact and reliable form just the in- 
formation needed by the average non-musical person 
who wants to know enough about the work to which he 
is listening to take an intelligent interest in the per- 
formance. The remarkable vogue of comic opera dur- 
ing recent years has prompted Mr. Upton to add " The 
Standard Light Operas " (McClurg) to his well-known 
series. Brief descriptions are given of about seventy 
works, ranging all the way down from " Mignon " to 
" King Dodo," and from the operas of Bellini and 
Donizetti to those of Mr. Reginald de Koven and Mr. 
Leslie Stuart. Offenbach and Lecocq are here (would 
that we might hear them now and then !) and Auber 
and Supp^ and Wallace. The entire series of Gilbert 
and Sullivan productions is also included. 



Notes. 



Dr. Charles McMurry has prepared a " Teacher's 
Manual of Geography " to accompany the series of 
geographical text-books of which, in conjunction with 
Professor Tarr, he is the author. The Macmillan Co. 
are the publishers. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have published " An 
English-German Conversation Book," the work of Pro- 
fessors Gustav Kriiger and C. Alphonso Smith. The 
subject-matter of the conversations is highly practical, 
relating largely to matters of travel and education. 

" A College Manual of Rhetoric," by Dr. James 
Sears Baldwin, is a recent publication of Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. As the title indicates, the 
work is for advanced students, and is provided with 
abundant material for the exercise of the student mind 
in the various forms of analysis and composition. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have published, 
in their " Riverside Literature Series," Miss Florence 
Holbrook's dramatization of " Hiawatha," an arrange- 
ment of the text for the use of school-children which 
ought to prove the basis for an instructive and inter- 
esting form of entertainment. There are pictures, mu- 
sical numbers, and full directions for the performance. 

The title and author of the new romance dealing 
with the careers of Lewis and Clark, to be issued next 
month by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., are now defi- 
nitely announced. The book will be called " The Con- 
quest: The True Story of Lenris and Clark," and the 
author is Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, well-known through 
her previous volume on " McLoughlin and Old Oregon." 

An important series of monographs on " The His- 
toric Highways of America," prepared by Mr. Archer 
Butler Hulbert, is announced by the Arthur H. Clark 
Co. of Cleveland. There will be sixteen volumes in all, 
dealing collectively with the history of America as por- 
trayed in the evolution of its highways of war, com- 
merce, and social expansion. The enterprise should 
fill an important and hitherto unoccupied place in 
American historical literature. 

Two more preprints from the Decennial Publications 
of the University of Chicago have reached our table. 
Like the issues previously noted, these monographs are 
included in the quarto series. They are " The Treat- 
ment of Nature in the Works of Nikolaus Lenau," by 
Professor Camillo von Klenze, and " The Physical 
Characteristics of the Indians of Southern Mexico," 
by Professor Frederick Starr. The latter work has 
many illustrations in the form of portrait representa- 
tions of the types described. 

Having completed five semi-annual volumes in its 
first form, "The International Monthly," edited by 
Mr. Frederick A. Richardson, now becomes "The 
International Quarterly." The September issue, just 
published, presents a dignified appearance, with its 214 
large pages, and its even dozen of elaborate essays, 
supplemented by Mr. Bishop's quarterly chronicle of 
current affairs. Attractive as was the early form of 
this review, it seems to us that the new one is in better 
accord with the serious character of the articles that 
Mr. Richardson, with the aid of his advisory board, has 
been securing from the very start of bis enterprise. 
More clearly than ever before, this periodical asserts its 
position as the most important organ of contemporary 
thought that we now have, and becomes more than 
ever indispensable to the general reader of cultivated 
interests.

Just So Stories by Rudyard Kipling 



M- 



R. KIPLING'S new book for children promises to rival his 
Jungle Books." It is the first volume he has illustrated. 
The New Tork Herald says : " Mr. Kipling's pictures have the 
sure touch of the practised artist. The stories are extravaganzas 
full of humorous conceits and laughable incidents, eminently 
well adapted to keep the nursery in a roar. And after the nursery 
is through, the book may be passed up to the study, where 
older folk will enjoy it as fully as the youngsters." {Net, $i.20.) 



TANGLED UP IN BEULAH LAND By "J. P. M." 

A brilliant and delightful story, continuing the fortunes of some of the characters in " A Journey to 
Nature," but introducing also the new figure of "Polly," the heroine, as fresh and captivating a 
damsel as one could imagine. (Decorated, net, ji.50.) 

THE WOOING OF JUDITH By SARA BEAUMONT KENNEDY 

Mrs. Kennedy here follows her very successful novel of "Joscelyn Cheshire" with a romantic love 
story of old Virginia, full of feeling and idyllic sentiment. (Si. 50.) 

THE MISDEMEANORS OF NANCY By ELEANOR HOYT 

" Nancy is dainty and American ; she is light, she is funny. For the drowsy solitude of the shade- 
swung hammock, Nancy will be a heaven-sent blessing." — The Bookman. (Illustrated by Stanlaws, 

$1.50.) 

THE LEOPARD'S SPOTS By THOMAS DIXON, Jr. 

"THE EPIC OF THE SOUTH." A very strong book, presenting conditions in the South as the 
Southerners view them. "It burns and gleams with the fervor of the South." — Chicago Evening 
Post. (Illustrated by Williams, 51.50.) 

THE BATTLE-GROUND By ELLEN GLASGOW 

" A more charming picture of Virginia life just before the Civil War and at its outbreak has never 
appeared. It is cheerful, wholesome, and forceful." — H. W. Mabie in The Outlook. (Illustrated 
by Baer and Granville Smith, $1.50.) 

BELSHAZZAR By WILLIAM STEARNS DAVIS 

"Should attain extraordinary popularity. . . . The story marches gallantly, and lags at no point. 
Mr. Davis has already achieved much consideration, and ' Belshazzar ' will add to his reputation."- — 
Chicago Tribune. (Illustrated by Ziegler, $1.50.) 

THE COLONIALS By ALLEN FRENCH 

"So strong, so symmetrical, so virile a book of romantic fiction that it may fairly be called great. 
The plot is worked out with great skill." — Brooklyn Eagle. (Decorated, $1.50.) 

THE COAST OF FREEDOM By ADELE MARIE SHAW 

A virile tale of the adventurous times of Wm. Phips, the first "self-made American." " Of absorb- 
ing interest from the first chapter to the closing page." — Brooklyn Eagle. (Illustrative maps, $1.50.)

THE DIAL

tween the work of Zola and the work of Balzac. 
The Bougon-Macquart books embodied the idea 
of the " Comedie Hamaine " over again, but 
with all the differences that half a century — 
and that century the nineteenth — could make. 
Zola had studied his Balzac, but he had also 
studied his Taine and his Flaubert ; moreover, 
he had become imbued with the scientific spirit, 
and did his work in an age that had created 
the science of sociology, and that had come to 
understand something of the workings of 
heredity. These considerations will serve to 
make the contrast clear, and we must supple- 
ment them by saying that the sombre genius 
of Zola had no element of humor in its com- 
position. This fact alone made a " human 
tragedy" out of what might otherwise have 
been another sort of " human comedy." 
Finally, we must say that Zjla, in his eager- 
ness to present types, frequently forgot to 
make them human beings as well, and that the 
aim of his work throughout is not so much the 
creation of individual characters as it is the 
presentation of situations and tendencies and 
the struggle of contending forces. At its best, 
this purpose led him to heights of epic grand- 
eur, but he achieved his most impressive effects 
at the expense of that individual characteriza- 
tion which the artistic novelist should never 
permit to escape from his view. 

No sooner had Zola completed his score of 
volumes devoted to the Rougon-Macquart an- 
nals than he was at work upon the trilogy of 
" Les Trois Villes." In this less ambitious 
but still reasonably colossal undertaking, Ro- 
man Catholicism is the subject of investiga- 
tion ; and is studied successively at Lourdes, 
Rome, and Paris. To quote from Professor B. 
W. Wells, who has provided the present arti- 
cle with more than one suggestion, the central 
thought of the trilogy is " that emotional mys- 
ticism is a morbid compound of passion and 
pettiness, pity and pathos, sure to be exploited 
by the spirit of ecclesiastical commercialism." 
The tendency of the work is strongly anti- 
Catholic, but by no means anti-religious. The 
determined foe of every form of supernatural 
religion, the sturdy champion of reason in its 
secular struggle with unreason, Zola is yet no 
shallow materialist or advocate of a hedonistic 
ethics, but rather a voice pleading for the spir- 
itual qualities of human nature with all the 
passion at his command. If he seems to speak 
too urgently in the name of science, it is be- 
cause science has for him a larger than the 
common meaning, and includes, among other 



things, the full recognition of those energies 
that manifest themselves in the religious life. 
To direct these energies into rational channels 
is his aim, not to impoverish the life of the 
soul by repressing them. In this endeavor, 
the Zeitgeist is his potent ally, and the future 
will remember with gratitude his work for the 
liberation of the spirit from the trammels of 
superstition. 

The last great work planned by the great 
writer whose shocking death has left us with 
such a sense of loss was the tetralogy of " Le» 
Quatre Evangiles." The four gospels of the 
new religion of humanity are to be f ruitf ulness, 
labor, truth, and justice. To each of these great 
themes a volume was to be devoted, and with 
this magnificent conception we come to that- 
complete preoccupation with large ideas which 
so distinguishes the work of his latest years. 
Formerly, the central idea of a novel was apt to 
become submerged beneath the flood of detail 
that his method of treatment made necessary; 
at last he learned to keep the idea afloat, and 
to make his voluminous observations contrib- 
ute to its exaltation. Of the four works pro- 
jected, "Feeondite " and "Travail " have beeo 
published ; " Verite " has been practically 
completed, and " Justice " alone is left unem- 
bodied in what we had hoped might become 
the masterpiece among all his works. But 
perhaps the battle which he fought for justice 
in the arena of public life would have been 
held for a finer monument to that master- 
passion of great souls than the epic fiction 
which he wished to consecrate to the idea. At 
least three of Zola's four gospels may be ac- 
cepted by all who take an impersonal interest 
in the welfare of mankind. In preaching the 
gospel of fruitfulness he seems to us to have 
been mistaken. There is no people in the old 
world among whom well-being is more widely 
diffused than among his countrymen, and the 
nearly stationary population of France ap- 
pears to be one of the chief reasons for this 
fortunate state. Politicians and statesmen with 
dreams of military glory may desire an increas- 
ing birth-rate, but the sober philosopher will 
rather look with envy upon a people who are 
free from the constant increase of the pres- 
sure of population upon the means of sub- 
sistence. But the gospels of labor and truth 
and justice are eternally true, and the effort of 
no man's life could have a nobler consecration 
than that with which Zola sought to crown 
his own labors, and which he had so nearly 
achieved at the time of his sudden taking off.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



When a great writer has died, and we come 
to ask questions about his work, the final ques- 
tion must always be as to whether that work 
is destined to survive. For the writer who 
makes his appeal to the world in the terms of 
art something more than ideas are needed to 
secure immortality. If we grant all that may 
be claimed for Zola's ideas by the most enthu- 
siastic of his followers, we are still confronted 
with the question of their expression. Now it 
must be allowed that Zola's style is not, for the 
most part, distinguished. Three-fourths of his 
many thousands of pages are heavy, shapeless, 
and hopelessly inartistic. On the other hand, 
there are purple patches of composition that 
meet the reader's eye, often when he least ex- 
pects them, and fairly startle him into admir- 
ation. It is for the sake of these, if for any- 
thing, that Zola's novels will continue to be 
read. The bulk of his work is already dead ; 
it represents an impossible method and a dis- 
credited literary tendency. But there is enough 
■of it that rises above the author's own theories 
to retain for him the attention of all who are 
•willing to be at some pains for their literary 
satisfactions. When the memory of the man 
himself shall have passed away, and when his 
books as a whole remain only as instructive 
documents for the history of nineteenth century 
sociology, we cannot believe that there will not 
still be a few readers who, strictly for art's 
sake, will feel that it is worth while to explore 
the wilderness of his work for its buried treas- 
ures. And in the history of modern fiction, 
the figure of Emile Zola, because of his fame 
and influence while he lived, cannot fail to oc- 
cupy a commanding position. 



Oxford, on the 8th inst., observed a notable anni- 
versary — the three hundredth year of the opening of 
the Bodleian Library, the first public library in England, 
if not in Europe. The real event is anticipated, because 
it was not until November 8, 1602, that the present 
foundation was thrown open to the public by the munifi- 
cence of Sir Thomas Bodley, once lecturer in Greek and 
public orator. At his own expense he refitted the bare 
walls of the library of Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, 
founded about 1450, but allowed to be completely 
broken up and dispersed. Sir Thomas spent a fortune 
upon his library. He also had the foresight to bargain 
with the Company of Stationers, in exchange for a gift 
of plate worth £30, that a copy of every book entered 
at Stationers' Hall should go to the library. In time it 
came about that registry at Stationers' Hall was re- 
quired to secure copyright, so that Oxford, as well as 
the British Museum, and the public libraries at Cam- 
bridge, Edinburg, and Dublin get a free copy of every 
book published in Great Britain. The Bodleian Library 
contains 600,000 bound volumes.

A View of All, the Russias.* 



The liberality of Mr. Henry Norman's politi- 
cal views, and the fact that, though an English- 
man, he was educated in Harvard University, 
have enabled him to write a book on the Rus- 
sian people and State which is likely to prove 
of peculiar interest to Americans. Mr. Norman 
is, first of all, sympathetic with Russia, and be- 
lieves the present Czar to be a man of dominant 
influence in his own dominions, bureaucratic 
traditions to the contrary notwithstanding, and 
that immense autocratic power is exercised 
with a fine humanitarianism, and always for 
the good of the Russian commonwealth. He 
is accordingly disposed to exalt the present 
system of government as approximating the 
ideal of a beneficent despotism, and he certainly 
looks upon it as better calculated to serve the 
needs of the governed here than any other sys- 
tem imaginable. He finds good in the childlike 
disposition of the commonality, and in the per- 
fect accord existing between them and the 
heirarchy, down to the humblest village priest. 
Though by no means abstaining from sharp 
and occasionally severe adverse criticism, his 
tone is always kindly, and the work appears to 
have been written with full comprehension of 
the many complex problems which it involves. 
It is certainly based upon a very unusual per- 
sonal knowledge, including the results of many 
extended journeys over almost the entire extent 
of the enormous Russian territory, in which the 
author was at all times aided by the Russian 
officials in the acquirement of knowledge. As 
a result the work contains much matter of the 
first importance, and presents many views which 
are not commonly held. 

One reason, at least, why Mr. Norman found 
so much charm in Russian society, using the 
word inclusively, may be found in such stories 
as the following : 

" Russian life abounds in incidents which illustrate 
a personal sympathy between high and low existing in 
no other society. I read, for instance, that one day a 
miserably ragged man begged an alms at a railway 
station from a prosperous-looking passenger. At that 
moment a General — and it must be remembered that 
in Russia a General is a very great personage — with 
his pretty young wife came upon the platform. 'I will 
give you five roubles,' said the man heartlessly, ' if you

will kiss the General's wife.' The beggar went straight 
to the lady, fell upon his knees, and told her of his 
plight. She listened, and then, getting her husband's 
permission, held out her cheek for him to kiss. The 
Novoe Vremja, which told the story, added truly that 
sach magnanimity could only occur in Russia." 

There are of course, many elements besides 
that of magnanimity which are exotic in such 
a story, but it is pleasant to read nevertheless. 
This anecdote precedes a similar one in which 
the Czar is known to have complied with the 
aniversal custom at Eastertide by saluting a 
common soldier on sentry duty who was the 
first to offer him the greeting of the day. 

It is with St. Petersburg and the two Mos- 
cows, old and new, that Mr. Normans long 
narrative opens, and it does not close until a 
large part of the earth's surface has been trav- 
ersed and practically all of it brought under 
discussion. Mr. Norman went to see Count 
Tolstoy, and assured him, to his hearer's ex- 
pressed sorrow, that both socialism and the 
single-tax movement were not as active in 
England as formerly, and that so far as the 
latter is concerned '• nothing was being done 
about it at all." This is a lapse, pardonable 
enough, in Mr. Norman's wide acquaintance 
with public affairs. The truth is, rather, that 
practical socialism has assumed forms that 
have only recently been made the subject of 
inquiry, so threatening to public interests have 
they begun to appear ; while the underlying 
principles of the single-tax have made enormous 
strides toward practical realization, and are 
commanding more and more attention. This 
lapse apart, and an occasional failure to trans- 
literate Russian words uniformly, are, however, 
the only errors noticeable in the work, remark- 
able as it is in scope. 

In speaking of Russia's successful efforts to 
obliterate the autonomy of Finland, Mr. Nor- 
man, while admitting the unconstitutionality of 
this action, goes on to lay down the following 
argument in its defense : 

" As a matter of plain fact, there is in human affaim 
of this kind no such thing as finality. Or rather, the 
only final thing is force majeure — imperative national 
self-interest. Before that, all promises are air, and 
all treaties are black marks on white paper. I put 
this brutally ( foreseeing the consequences); but there 
is no use in miueing words. Every student of history, 
politics, or diplomacy knows it to be the simple truth; 
and every country, not Russia alone, affords examples 
in proof. Germany broke her promises to Denmark. 
France broke her promises about Madagascar. To 
eome nearer home, England has repeatedly pledged 
herself to evacuate Egvpt, and the United States was 
solemnly pledged to grant complete indeptendence to 
Cuba. None of these pledges seems likely to be kept. 



... I do not defend the principle — I state the fact. 
'Pity 't is, 't is true.'" 

While it is somewhat reassuring to have this 
question thus frankly put down as exemplify* 
ing " the good old rule, the simple plan," 
rather than to call it, as some Americans have, 
''the higher morality," it is far from reassur- 
ing t-o feel that Mr. Norman can find any pal- 
liation whatever for an international crime by 
pleading other international crimes, or that 
nations are free to act at all times without ref- 
erence to higher ideals or the dictates of a 
common conscience. So brutal a policy is 
bound to react disastrously upon the subjects 
or citizens of the state practising it, as Ameri- 
cans are learning to their sorrow, and as Great 
Britain has just learned in a baptism of blood 
and tears. If history were less insistent in 
teaching the higher lesson that 

" At whites, or short or long. 
May be diaoemed a wrong 
Dying as of self-slanghter," 

the lesson that greed, whether individual or 
national, carries its own punishment, and that 
the way which we find him here defending on 
" practical " grounds has been uniformly a way 
leading down into the dark, — the author's 
words would sound less specious and less 
vicious. 

The story of the march of Musoovy across 
the continent of Asia, familiar as it is, by this 
time, to English readers, gains new force 
when described by one who has seen its effects 
face to face. The story of the Russification 
of the Caucasus, of the principalities of central 
Asia, through the Trans- Caspian railway and 
its prolongation to the gates of Afghanistan, 
and of the gain in civilization as a consequence, 
reads like a dream. This, to one who remem- 
bers the tales of travellers not yet yellowed by 
time, is an example : 

" The train slackens speed on the second erening, 
draws up to a long platform full of brilliant nniforms 
whose wearers are escorting elegant ladies, while a 
band strikes up a gay tune, and your window stops ex- 
actly opposite the word ' Merv ' over the central door- 
way. You cannot quite believe it. But it is a fact. 
The whole oasis of Merv, one of the most fertile spots 
in the world, is as Russian as Riga ; and when yon sar 
' Merv ' in central Asia you mean a long, low, neat, stone 
railway station, lit by a score of bright lamps in a row, 
where the train changes engines, while in a busy tele- 
graph office a dozen operators sit before their clicking 
instruments." 

It is from this neighborhood, so we are in- 
formed, that Russia is obtaining a supply of 
cotton for her rapidly increasing spindles which 
are destined at no long interval to make her 



236

[Oct. 16, 



manufacturers independent of the American 
product. The causes and effects of history 
are seldom more strikingly set forth than in a 
subsequent passage dealing with this same 
question as follows : 

" The water-basin of this part of Trans-Caspia is in 
Persia, and the Amir of Afghanistan controls, in the 
River Murghab, the water supply of the great Merv 
oasis and other districts. Therefore if these possessions 
of Russia are ever to regain their ancient wealth, when 
Merv, for instance, was really 'Queen of the World,' 
Russia must rule in Persia and Afghanistan. North- 
ern Persia the province of Khorassan — is probably 

at her mercy, to seize whenever an opportunity or an 
excuse presents itself, but Afghanistan is quite another 
matter, for the British fleet blocks the way thither. 
Thus the cotton crop of central Asia, and purchases 
for Russia on the markets of Richmond and New Or- 
leans, for it is Russia's desire to grow all her own 

cotton and buy none abroad, — depend at last upon the 
number of ironclads that fly the cross of St. George in 
the Channel and Mediterranean." 

There are several chapters of summing up, 
after the descriptions of the almost intermin- 
able journeys which have fallen to Mr. Nor- 
man's lot ; a strongly written appreciation of 
M. de Witte, the Russian minister of finance ; 
and the statement that there is everything to 
be gained and little to be lost by amity be- 
tween Russia and Great Britain. The effect 
of the Sultan's grant to Germans for building 
a railway to Baghdad is described as marking a 
new step in the political history of the world, 
and one almost ruinous to Russian aspirations 
in that direction. There is a word of wisdom 
about the relations of Russia and our own 
country which is worth remembering, — though 
there will be little agreement among well- 
informed Americans that the instructions to 
the Russian fleet in New York harbor during 
the darkest days of the Civil War were " apo- 
cryphal." But the rest, strangely though it 
sounds, is almost self-evident : 

" There has been for long in the United States a 
belief that Russia is a genuine, sympathetic friend, 
moved by admiration for the American people and their 
institutions. This has grown up chiefly, 1 suppose, from 
the apocryphal narratives of the readiness of Russia to 
intervene on the side of right during the war of the 
Rebellion. Therefore the American people have fre- 
quently made public profession of their friendship for 
Russia, which Russia, needless to say, has cordially ac- 
cepted ; for who would refuse such a gift? But the 
whole belief is a political soap-bubble. It is nothing 
but a bright film in the ether. Russia likes to appear 
a friend of the United States, because the effect of that 
is to postpone any cooperation of England and America 
in world affairs, — a contingency which Russia is not 
the only power to fear. But beyond this, she seldom 
thinks of the United States, except to admire and envy 



its vast prosperity ; among the official and reactionary 
class, to regard its institutions with profound disap- 
proval ; to anticipate the time when enough cotton will 
be grown in Turkestan to make it safe for her to put a 
prohibitive tax upon every American bale ; or to wish 
that the American billionaires would invest a few spare 
millions in government guaranteed 4 per cent, bonds of 
Russian railways. . . . Beyond these things, America 
does not exist for Russia, except when a troublesome 
Secretary of State puts a series of direct questions about 
Manchuria or the Open Door, and insists upon answers 
in writing. In fact, Russia, with no ill-will at all, thinks 
about America precisely what a great religious autoc- 
racy must think about a huge secular democracy four 
thousand miles away. The rest is mere flag-wagging." 

There are scores of other interesting ques- 
tions raised in this comprehensive work which 
abundantly deserve reading in their context. 
Certainly the thoroughness with which the 
subject has been studied, and the illuminating 
character of the work, justify the delay in its 
appearance. The numerous maps and pictures, 
it is well to add, have been specially produced 
for their use here, and give the book much ad- 
ditional value. John J. Culver. 



A Book of Rocky Mountain Birds.* 

One turns the pages of Mr. Keyser's new 
book about the " Birds of the Rockies " with 
feelings of pleasure and content, so charming 
are its external features and so valuable its con- 
tents. But with this feeling comes a yearning 
desire to visit Colorado the very next spring- 
time, and experience for oneself the delights of 
searching its plains and climbing its mountain 
heights in quest of the feathered fraternity that 
inhabit them. The author had prepared us in 
his previous volume, " In Bird Land," for the 
pleasure afforded in this. But he here traverses 
entirely new ground, and furnishes information 
not to be gained elsewhere. The traveller and 
summer resident in the Rocky Mountains have 
been at a loss where to look for a popular ac- 
count of the forms of bird-life that people the 
valleys and the acclivities, and even the sum- 
mits, of the lofty peaks that lift their brows 
far into cloud-land ; and this want the present 
volume admirably fills. 

During the seasons of 1899 and 1901, Mr. 
Keyser explored the arid plains and mesas, 
the deep canons and the regions of highest

altitude adjacent to the great thoroughfares 
cutting through the Continental Divide in Col- 
orado. Afoot and alone, or with a companion 
having tastes like his own, he clambered up 
and down the towering masses of Pike's Peak 
and Gray's Peak, not to mention inferior em- 
inences which he trod with slow step and pier- 
cing vision, that no secret of the "winged 
rarities " might escape him. The history of 
these adventures and discoveries is related 
in vivid style and with gratifying fulness of 
detail. 

Mr. Keyser's investigations began at Man- 
iton, where he found many of our common 
birds in abundance, and foremost among them 
the robin, which was preaching its gospel of 
cheer with unabated devotion. The first real 
stranger encountered was the western wood- 
pewee. Instead of the sweet arc of sound 
the eastern pewee describes, this bird of the 
Rockies emits a shrill scream that is more 
like a cry of anguish than a happy love-song. 
Where the species are superabundant, the 
author describes their morning concerts as 
positively distressing. In place of our gay 
Baltimore oriole, Bullock's oriole (an equally 
brilliant bird and a better singer) was plenti- 
ful. Our lovely rose-breasted grosbeak was 
replaced by the black-headed grosbeak; our 
familiar tanager, in flaming scarlet, gave way 
to the Louisiana tanager, bedight in yellow 
plumes ; while our towhee bunting was repre- 
sented by the green-tailed bunting and wholly 
surpassed by him in power of vocalization. 
The song of the latter species, Mr. Keyser t^lls 
OS, " is wild and free, has the swing of all out- 
doors, and is not pitched to a minor key." At 
every turn he met some new bird which to see 
and hear excited fresh interest and delight. 

The upper part of the ascent of Pike's Peak, 
dragging hours on into the night, had been to 
our author a painful, almost a tragical, expe- 
rience : yet a day spent with the rosy finches 
and the pipits, birds that range over the bald 
plateau that crowns the tremendous height, 
restored the vigor of the traveller, and he set 
out on the return tramp in a state of high ex- 
hilaration. 

" As I began the desceDt, I whistled and sang, — 
that is, I tried to. To be frauk, it was all noise and no 
music; but I must have some way of giving expression 
to the uplifted emotions that filled my breast. Again 
and again I said to myself, ' I 'm so glad! I 'm so glad! 
I 'm so glad ! ' It was gladness pure and simple, — the 
dictionary has no other word to express it." 



The explorer was treated to other rare en- 
tertainments in his stealthy study of the birds. 
More than one graphic description of the aerial 
evolutions of different species tempts the re- 
viewer to stay for a quotation. 

" The pipit, the horned lark, and Townsend's soli- 
taire, in moods of exhilaration soared to dizzying 
heights with eyes fixed boldly on the sun. Prom the 
top of Pike's head, more than fourteen thousand feet 
above the sea, np, up, up, a pipit swnng, in a series of 
, oblique leaps and circles, this way and that, until be 
I became a mere speck in the sky, and then disappeared 
' from sight in the ceruleon depths beyond. All the 
while I could hear his emphatic and rapidly repeated 
I call, ' Te-cheer! te-cheer! ' sifting down out of the blue 
I canopy. How long be remained aloft in bis watcb- 
' tower in the skies, I do not know; for one cannot well 
count minutes in such exciting circumstances; but it 
■ seemed a long time. By and by the call appeared to 
be coming nearer, and the little aeronaut swept down 
with a swiftness that made my blood tingle, and alighted 
on a rock as lightly as a snowflake." 

A favorite pastime with the broad-tailed 
hnmming-bird is to 

" Dart np in the air, and then down, almost striking a 
bush or a clump of grass at each descent, repeating 
this feat a number of times with a swiftness that the 
eye can scarcely follow. Having done this, be will 
swing up into the air so far that you can scarcely see 
him with the naked eye; the next moment he will drop 
into view, poise in mid-air seventy-five or a hundred 
feet above your head, supporting himself by a swift 
motion of the wings, and simply hitching to right and 
left in short arcs, as if he were fixed on a pivot, some- 
times meanwhile whirling clear around. There he hangs 
on his invisible axis until you grow tired watching him, 
and then he darts to his favorite perch on a dead tree." 

Mr. Keyser was fortunate in finding the 
nests of most of the species that came under 
his observation, but in every instance the 
sanctity of the little home was held inviolate. 
To fit the volume for more extended service, 
the author has supplemented his text with a 
check-list of the birds known to occur in Col- 
orado. Only two States in the Union, Texas 
and California, can boast of as rich an avi- 
fauna, the number of species noticed amount- 
ing to 389. Of these 249 remain to breed. 
Copious illustrations add their enticement to 
the work. Eight are full-page plates by Mr. 
Lonis Agassiz Fuertes, four of which are in 
color ; eight full-page photographs of scenes 
by the way are reproduced; and a multitude 
of dainty pictures by Mr. Bruce Horsfall are 
set in the margin or venture midway into the 
pages. An index furnishes the final accessory 
to a book that is a tribute to the aesthetic de- 
mands of the cultivated reader.

Napoleon and the Peace of Amiens.» 

No other incident in the career of Napoleon 
has caused greater controversy than the sud- 
den rupture of the Treaty of Amiens, and the 
renewal of war between France and England 
after a brief and troubled experience of peace. 
It has been hitherto the generally accepted 
belief of English historians that the rupture of 
the Peace of Amiens was not a disappointment, 
but rather a satisfaction, to Napoleon ; indeed, 
that the renewal of war was but the culmina- 
tion of a plan conceived, and in part matured, 
by the great commander himself. 

In regard to this important point, as to 
many others, it becomes necessary to reverse 
previous opinions in the new light brought to 
bear upon the events of that time by Mr. J. H. 
Eose, in his recent scholarly life of Napoleon. 
Mr. Rose's work, the result of many years' 
study among the records of the British Foreign 
Office, presents and proves so many new facts, 
that theories of events and even periods in 
Napoleon's life must be wholly reconstructed. 
In the chapters on " The Peace of Amiens " 
and " The Renewal of War," Mr. Rose gives 
in detail an account of diplomatic events, some 
of them new, and offers a logical explanation 
of the causes resulting in the termination of 
peace. Thus it is shown by exact citations that 
Cornwallis, the English negotiator, actually did 
concede more than the English government was 
prepared to yield, and did violate his instruc- 
tions, — instructions which reached him be- 
fore, not after, the signing of the treaty, the 
usual statement to the contrary notwithstand- 
ing. Until now there has been no positive ver- 
ification of this fact, and it has rested solely 
upon a verbal statement by Napoleon, made 
long after the occurrence itself. These ex- 
treme concessions were taken in France to 
indicate a suspicious generosity on the part of 
the British government, as Mr. Rose shows by 
a quotation from a report by a semi-official 
secret agent in Paris, who wrote : 

" I canuot get it into my head that the British min- 
istry has acted in good faith in subscribing to the pre- 
liminaries of peace, which, considering the respective 
positions of the parties, would be harmful to the En- 
glish people. . . . People are persuaded in France that 
the moderation of England is only a snare put in Bona- 
parte's way, and it is mainly in order to dispel it that 
our journals have received the order to make much of 
the advantages which must accrue to England from the 
conquests retained by her." 
Such insincerity on th e part of the English

government, the author emphatically denies ; 
yet the first impression in France, that En- 
gland had yielded everything merely to gain a 
breathing spell in which to prepare for a re- 
newal of the struggle, inevitably rendered less 
secure the permanence of peace itself, for pop- 
ular distrust created an exaggerated tenderness 
for national honor, which was bound to react 
upon the French government. Napoleon him- 
self believed England to be honest, and power- 
less ; and thus believing, rapidly pushed his 
agressions upon the continent, drafted vast 
schemes of colonial expansion, and in diplo- 
matic notes to Russia and Austria suggested a 
partition of the Turkish Empire, this last being 
but a step in the furtherance of his plans for a 
control of the land route to India. Hence, says 
Mr. Rose, came England's determination to 
keep Malta, or to secure some equivalent sta- 
tion in the Mediterannean, which, it is sur- 
prising to learn, was Jlrst urged by Russia, 
whose government was alarmed at Napoleon's 
plans of Eastern dominion. Indeed, the author 
cites the exact despatch in the foreign office 
showing that the retention of Malta had pre- 
viously been urged by the Russian government. 
A little later, it is true. Napoleon, by a clever 
and flattering appeal to Alexander for friendly 
intervention, secured a Russian demand that 
England evacuate Malta. Napoleon, however, 
not being aware of the earlier Russian sug- 
gestion, and believing England friendless, and 
her administration weak, publicly committed 
himself by threats and inspired articles in the 
" Moniteur " to an insistence upon England's 
withdrawal from Malta. In this he went too 
far, for in reality he did not desire to renew 
war at the moment. But public sentiment in 
France, the popular tenderness for national 
honor, suspicious from the first of English sin- 
cerity, forced him to maintain the stand he had 
taken. Thus the all-powerful ruler of France 
was trapped, or rather trapped himself, into a 
war for which he was not prepared. Mr. Rose 
supports this thesis with much documentary 
and diplomatic evidence, concluding "I can- 
not agree . . . that Napoleon wanted war. I 
think he did not, until his navy was ready." 

From the historian's point of view, it is in 
such incidents as the one just cited that Mr. 
Rose's " Life of Napoleon " is chiefly valuable. 
He has added much to our knowledge of En- 
glish diplomatic action for the period, and 
incidentally has thereby suggested many rea- 
sonable hypotheses for hitherto clouded causes 
of action in Napoleon's career. But it would

be QDJast to the aathor to specify these merits 
alone. His work is naturally much couceraed 
with Don- English sources, and in these he ex- 
hibits an unusual degree of scholarly care in 
selection. Moreover he has produced a dis- 
tinctly readable life, sane, yet full of admira- 
tion for the genius of his hero, scientific, yet 
entertaining. 

Mr. Rose's book is conspicuously given over 
to the examination of Napoleon's public career, 
not lacking in analysis of his strong personality, 
but excluding much traditional gossip. While, 
however, the reader is spared many of the 
realistic, and sometimes unpleasant, details of 
Napoleon's private life and habits, he is shown 
the best, indeed the truest, side of his charac- 
ter. Yet the narrative does not suffer, the 
interest is maintained, and the book is brought 
to a conclusion without any resort to melo- 
dramatic effects to hold attention. Mr. Rose's 
Bonaparte is one who 

" Id bis temperament as in the circumstances of his time 
was destined for an extraordinary career; a man who 
dared much, achieved much, and in bis fall still held 
the love of many peoples, yet whose fall was not due 
to the treachery of -politicians, or the failings of the 
French, but to his own character and the character of 
the age in which he lived." 

Mr. Rose has given us quite the best short 
life of Napoleon in English.

I.IGHT8 AND SHAD0"WS OF THE CIVIL WAR.* 



Replete with vivid recollections of battles 
and campaigns, and redolent of camp and field 
and bivouac, a little book now comes to relate 
to us, after the lapse of forty years, a succes- 
sion of episodes of the Civil War, "as seen 
from the ranks." The writer was a boy soldier 
and musician in the 150th New York Volun- 
teers. Enlisting in the fall of 1862, as one of 
" three hundred thousand more," he served to 
the close of the war, traversing about one half 
the extent of the Confederacy. His duties as 
a musician in camp and on parade, and as a 
stretcher-bearer in the battle-field, allowed him 
a broad and free view of the striking features 
of such an extended range of experiences. 
Evidently he saw with keen and quick eyes, 
and the scenes and sounds which were, to an 
inexperienced boy, full of novelty, impressed 
themselves indelibly upon a lively imagination 
and a retentive memory. His book is worthy 

*As Skbk fbom the Rakks. By Charles E. Benton. 
New York : G. P. Potnam's Sons. 



of more than a passing notice, for it is far from 
being the ordinary collection of campaign rem- 
iniscences. Written in an easy and vivacious 
style, it is remarkable for the fidelity with 
which the strangeness, to the youthful partic- 
ipant, of the situations and episodes which 
were daily occurring, is here reproduced. One 
who encountered similar experiences during a 
like service in the army of the Republic, in 
reading these pages is transported back to the 
days of his own adolescence, and here renews 
the sensations which thrilled his young soul 
while in camp or on the march. 

Mr. Benton is a good raconteur and a ready 
word-painter ; and, fortunately for his readers, 
it is not the trite incidents of the war-time 
which have chiefly attracted his attention. 
One gets here a vivid picture of the General 
whose manner of holding his cigar in his 
mouth told his observant followers whether his 
anticipations were of a quiet and peaceful camp, 
or of a hot battle ; and of the southern buz- 
zard, whose lazy, circling flight over the camp 
led the Yankee boys to imagine that " He's 
counting us "; and one again hears distinctly 
the familiar voice of the mule, whose trumpet 
tones were understood to sing out, "Jo-o- 
Hooh-BT, ffook-er, Hook-er ! " 

Mr. Benton's fidelity of recollection is valu- 
able historically. He remembers and quotes 
correctly General Sherman's condensed opinion 
of the harshness of war, a remark which has 
been so many times quoted in a profane form 
that many persons of the present generation 
have come to believe that such were in fact 
the words of Sherman. But Mr. Benton states 
his epigram in the very words which were 
attributed to Sherman at the time the saying 
was first made current in 1863: *'War is 
cruelty ; you cannot refine it." 

A conspicuous illustration is given by our 
author of the readiness of the Union soldier to 
meet every emergency and fill every demand in 
society, government, or administration. The 
entry of Sherman's army into Savannah, though 
anticipated, came at last with such suddenness 
as to drive out the working force of the " Sa- 
vannah Republican " between two issues of the 
newspaper. The men of the occupying army 
stepped in, set type from copy prepared by 
their comrades, ran the presses, and on the day 
of their entry into the city sent forth and dis- 
tributed the daily paper without the loss of a 
single issue. 

Mr. Benton disclaims the attempt to write 
history. But the history of the Civil War,

which the future is to furnish us, will be drawn 
largely from such sources of original and 
authentic information as this book ; and the 
freshness and animation of his style of compo- 
sition might well be employed in writing an 
account of the operations of the entire war, so 
full and complete that his readers would gladly 
class it as history. James O. Pierce. 



Beasts, Birds, and Fishes.* 

In his most charming foreword to " The Kin- 
dred of the Wild" Mr. Roberts traces the genesis 
of the animal story of to-day from the engrossing 
part which it played in the drama of primitive 
man through the stages of fable, tale of adventure, 
animal anecdote, the purpose story as in " Black 
Beauty," up to the frankly humanized tales of Mr. 
Kipling. Its farther evolution has freed it from 
the human element and carried it into the field of 
animal psychology. 

"Our chief writers of animal stories at the present 
day may be regarded as explorers of this unknown 
world, absorbed iu charting its topography. They 
work, indeed, upon a substantial foundation of known 
facts. They are minutely scrupulous as to their natural 
history, and assiduous contributors to that science. But 
above all they are diligent in their search for the mo- 
tive beneath the action. Their care is to catch the 
varying, illusive personalities which dwell back of the 
luminous brain windows of the dog, the horse, the deer, 
or wrap themselves in reserve behind the inscrutable 
eyes of all the cats, or sit aloof in the gaze of the 
hawk and the eagle. The animal story at its highest 
point of development is a psychological romance con- 
structed on a framework of natural science." 

Naturalists have no quarrel with the romances 
of animal psychology. They enjoy the stories as 
much, if not more, than do other folk. When, 
however, the romancers claim to be explorers in 
animal psychology and assiduous contributors to 
natural history the startled scientist scans in vain 
the unpaid pages of the chronicles of research in

these fields for some revelation of their discoveries. 
The credulous public as well as the naturalist will 
have difficulty in separating the fabric of romance 
from the framework of facts in any contribution 
prepared to meet the demands and rewards of the 
popular animal story. 

Just as the historical play or novel rests on some 
knowledge of the times and places in which the 
drama or romance was enacted, so the animal 
story requires a background of facts drawn from 
science for its setting. The success of all three 
types of literature depends much less on their faith- 
ful portrayal of historical or scientific fact than on 
their form and action. The play and the novel are 
not history, nor is the animal story primarily ani- 
mal psychology. It is not the psychology of it but 
the simple romance or tragedy of it which makes it 
interesting to most readers. 

It would be unjust to Mr. Roberts to impute to 
his tales any breath of suspicion that he has dis- 
torted the facts of science. Of all recent stories his 
carry to the skeptical the most conviction of scru- 
pulous faithfulness in detail of fact. It would be 
equally unfair to him not to recognize that his great 
success lies primarily not in this phase of the work, 
but in the technique of its presentation and in the 
tragedy or comedy which runs through his simple 
narrative. Mr. Roberts should not throw dust in 
the eyes of his readers. 

The most of the stories combined in this volume 
have appeared in periodical literature prior to their 
collection here. They will bear rereading many 
times. In purity and delicacy of diction, in whole- 
someness and absence of the shadows of coarseness 
or brutality which have crept into some animal 
stories, and in lightness and freedom of action, Mr. 
Roberts's animal stories are unsurpassed. 

A comprehensive and popular account of the 
food and game fishes of America within a compass 
permitting a moderate price has long been needed. 
The man who fishes, whether for sport or for the 
pan, and he whose piscatorial interests have only the 
gastronomic motive, will find in " American Food 
and Game Fishes " an authoritative and very com- 
plete treatise by whose use the proper designation, 
scientific or vernacular, may be found of all the 
American fish used as food or lured by the angler. 
President Jordan, of Stanford University, and Dr. 
B. W. Evermann, ichthyologist of the United States 
Fish Commission, have condensed from their more 
extensive and more technical " Fishes of Middle 
and North America," recently brought out by the 
Smithsonian Institution, this popular work. The 
attractive colored plates contained in the volume 
have been reproduced by lithography. They are 
well supplemented by numerous photographs from 
life by Mr. A. R. Dugmore, some of which excel 
the best productions of the artist in delineating the 
characteristic pose of the fish at rest or in action. 
The book contains brief scientific diagnoses of all 
the important fish, with keys for their determination

importance. lis scope inclades all fish foand north 
of Panama, both fresh water and marine, from both 
sides of the continent. It is a comprebensiTe and 
aathoritative work of reference for all who are in- 
terested in the finny tribes or who seek information 
on this phase of natare. Readers apon the Pacific 
-coast will feel that Dr. Jordan has exercised andae 
restraint in giving bat brief descriptions of the 
famoQB leaping tuna of Santa Catalina and of the 
huge jewfish of sontbern waters, and in leaving to 
the nbiqaitoas railway advertisement all illostration 
of these interesting monsters of the deep. 

It is fitting that the initial volame of the ''Amer- 
ican Sportsman's Library," edited by Mr. Caspar 
Whitney, should deal with "The Deer Family," 
that it should have as its anthors a group of men 
famous in the annals of sport in our forests, plains, 
and mountains, and that it should be dedicated to 
the '■ lover of the wild, free, lonely life of the wil- 
derness, and of the hardy pastimes known to the 
sojourners therein." 

" Tbe chase of all these noble and beautiful mnimalf 
has ever possessed a pecaliar fascination for bold and 
hardy men, skilled in the use of arms and the manage- 
ment of the horse, and wcmted to feats of strength and 
endoranee." 

The first half of the volume, — by Mr. Theodore 
Rooserelt, — deals with the mule-deer, the whitetail 
^ Virginia deer, the pronghorn antelope, and the 
wapiti. Their habits, present and past geographical 
distribution, and relative merits as objects of the 
chase, are fnlly set forth, and the methods parsned 
in tbeir quest are illustrated with many a personal 
anecdote of the hunt in the Bad Lands of the Little 
Missouri. Mr. T. S. Van T>\ke writes of the deer 
and elk of tbe Pacific coast, Mr. D. G. Elliott of 
the cariboo of the far north, and Mr. A. J. Stone 
contributes a well-worded discussion of the moose 
— the most cunning of all the large animals of 
North America and the first prize of tbe American 
big-game hunter. The book is written primarily 
for the hunter, but the field naturalist and every 
lover of nature will priz.e the insight into the lives 
of the deer and his kin which may be gained here. 

The introduction, written by the first-named 
anthor, contains a stirring plea for the preservation 
of our forests and of the wild things that dwell 
therein for the benefit and enjoyment of tbe public, 
and for wise legislation toward that end and its 
strict enforcement. He trenchantly condemns the 
game batcher. 

" Such a man is wholly obnoxioos; and, indeed, so is 
any man who shoots for the purpose of establishing a 
record of the amooot of game killed. If he is worthy 
of tbe name of trae sportsman he will feel infinitely 
more satisfaction in a single saceessful shot which comes 
to crown the triumph of his hardihood and address in 
exploriog the wilds, and in the actual stalk, than be 
would in any amoant of shooting at creatures driven 
past him from artificially stocked covers. The best 



test of the worth of any sport is the demand that sport 
makes upon those qualities of mind and body which in 
their snm we call manliness." 

The author defends vigorously the solid advan- 
tages of big-game hunting from the standpoint of 
national character. It is an antidote to that soft- 
ening of fibre incident to the highly complex in- 
dustrialism of our life and the character of many of 
its enjoyments. Furthermore, the big-game banter 
— humane, keen-eyed, strong-limbed, and stout- 
hearted — should also be a field naturalist, an 
adept with the camera. This quest '' will tax his 
skill far more than hunting with the rifle, while the 
reealts in the long ran will give maeh g^reater saUs- 
faction." 

A somewhat different tone pervades tlie volame 
on " Upland Game Birds " by Mr. Edwyn Sandys, 
in the same series. Here the point of view is that 
of tbe professional sportsman to whom the shooting 
of birds is a vocation rather than an avocation. 
The full bag is the criterion of sueeeaa, though the 
ethics of tbe sport seem to be sadly warped at 
times. Usefal wrinkles for eireamventing the sel- 
fish farmer and getting the advantage of your in- 
experienced comrade find a place in the work. 

" Some men love to show their superior knowl- 
edge, and yoor comrade may nibble at yoor bait, and 
promptly illustrate the proper method of getting a bird 
oat of brush — which is by jumping on the pile. He 
gets the bird out of the brnsh, but yon get the shot nine 
times out of ten." 

To the credit of the author he also states the other 
side of the question. 

■' Needless to say, by far the better way, in fact the 
only sportsmanlike way, is to insist upon a fair and 
sqoaie ifcaring of all hard work, rough beau, aod 
choice pontions. . . . Sharp practice is a deadly foe 
to sport; yet it is astonishing how far some men will 
go in tbeir eagerness to make the heaviest bag." 

The author laughs at the sentimentalism of the 
good ladies who object to dove shooting, and sug- 
gests that it is easily overcome by a mess of doves 
or some columbine millinery. He underestimates 
the motives which have inspired the movement to 
preserve our beautiful mourning dove from the fate 
of the wild pigeon. The book deals with tbe part- 
ridge and grouse families, the ptarmigan and tur- 
keys, woodcock, plover, cranes, and the dove. Mr. 
T. S. Van Dyke writes of the quail and grouse of the 
Pacific coast. The book is well written in a breezy, 
easy-going style, with little formality in language 
or arrangement. It is interesting reading, but it 
leaves one with a better opinion of Bob White than 
of some of his persecutors. 

It is a wholly different kind of sport that Mr. 
Job pursues in his " Among the Water Fowl." 
His hunting is with the camera and his bag a 
holder full of well-earned plates. His quest re- 
quires even more patience, skill, and risk than that 
of the more sanguinary banter, while his success 
brings pleasure to many others than himself. The

book reconnts his experiences and portrays ex- 
amples of his success in photographing water fowl 
in their native haunts, in flight and afloat and upon 
their nests. His field is a new one and his work 
unique. His experiences for many years among 
the lakes and marshes of western prairies and the 
almost inaccessible rocky islets of our northeastern 
shores form a tale of adventure quite as interesting 
as that which any wielder of a Winchester might 
relate. The book is not a manual of aquatic birds, 
but presupposes some knowledge of grebes and 
terns, cormorants and petrels, and other winged 
folk. It combines the elements of a narrative of 
adventure and a contribution to natural history. 
Lovers of birds will bid the new sport Godspeed, 
and welcome this form of sportsman to their ranks. 

In the imposing portfolio of "Nature Portraits " 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. have brought to- 
gether many of the choicest illustrations which have 
appeared in their well-known " Nature Series " and 
in other publications bearing their imprint. The 
text, obviously but a thread on which to hang the 
pictures, consists of five brief essays on pertinent 
aspects of nature-study, from the pen of Mr. L. H. 
Bailey, editor of " Country Life in America." In 
addition to a large number of half-tone engravings 
sprinkled throughout the text, there are fifteen 
detached plates especially adapted for framing. 
Several of these are direct photographic contact 
prints, and others are reproduced in photogravure 
and colors, forming together a series of great at- 
tractiveness and interest. The photogravure front- 
ispiece, from a photograph of deer taken by Mr. 
A. 6. Wallihan, is an especially beautiful plate.

" The Virginian " is the story of a nameless hero. 
Throughout the book he is called " the Virginian " 
and nothing else. But although nameless, as far 
as we are informed, he is one of the most distinct 
personalities that have appeared in American fic- 
tion. A Wyoming cow-boy, representing a phase 
of our civilization that has almost completely van- 
ished — although it was real enough a quarter of 
a century ago, — uneducated and unskilled in the 
amenities of artificial society, he conquers our sym-

pathies by his innate refinement of character and 
the clean manliness of his living. He represents 
an ideal that was probably never realized, yet the 
separate touches by which he is drawn for us bear 
the visible stamp of truth. His story is a series of 
episodes that may be enjoyed independently of one 
another, although they are held in a sort of unity 
by his relations with the New England girl who 
comes to Wyoming to teach school, and who 
promptly develops into as satisfactory a heroine as 
one could wish for. She gives him books to read, 
and his frank comments upon them are both hu- 
morous and refreshing. There are other humorous 
features, notably that which describes the mixing 
up of a dozen babies by changing their clothes — 
a prank not quite in keeping with the Virginian's 
character, but nevertheless irresistibly amusing. In 
the course of his career he finds himself a member 
of a lynching party, and the author makes the usual 
sophistical defense of this wild form of justice. 
" The Virginian " is a man's book, with not one 
touch of sickly sentiment, and must be regarded as 
a valuable human document because of the author's 
intimate acquaintance with the scenes and types 
which it portrays. 

It is to the outskirts of Bret Harte's country 
that we are taken by Mr. Frank Lewis Nason, in a 
novel called " To the End of the Trail." We mean 
this not so much in the geographical as in the 
romantic sense, for the scene is Colorado and not 
California, but the situations and the characters are 
of the kind with which Harte has made us fa- 
miliar. Tough Nut, in particular, is a hero of the 
mining-camp who is worthy of a place in Harte's 
gallery, and the Big Swede is represented with just 
the combination of womanly attractiveness and cal- 
culating wickedness that Harte would have delighted 
in portraying. The whole effect of the story is un- 
real and theatrical, but in this very artificiality is 
its fascination, a fact which again reminds us of the 
master whom Mr. Nason has studied to such good 
purpose. 

Mr. George McCutcheon, encouraged by his last 
year's success with " Graustark," has produced a 
second novel and called it " Castle Craneycrow." 
It is noticeably better than its predecessor, although 
it can hardly be described as a literary composition. 
There is something rather engaging about the 
frankness with which the author ccorns everything

in the nature of style and probability and the de- 
picting of possible human beings, and devotes him- 
self solely to the making of a plot and thederiging 
of a breathless succession of striking incidents. He 
has enough invention to make up, in part, for his 
lack of everything else in the novelist's equipment, 
and we should not be surprised to find '' Castle 
Craneycrow" among the most widely read of the 
season's books. The stratum of readers which such 
a book attracts is immensely populous, although its 
praise is not exactly of the sort for which a serious 
novelist would care. 

Still another story of the Civil War with a Vir- 
ginian setting and Virginian types of character is 
given us in " The Claybornes," by Mr. William 
Sage. Here the special theme is of brother against 
brother, and we follow the fortunes of the two men 
as they fight upon their respective sides in the great 
internecine struggle. The operations around Vicks- 
bnrg and the final scenes at R'chmond and Appo- 
mattox are the historical episodes upon which our 
attention is chiefly focussed. The story is a good 
example of careful but uninspired workmanship, 
essentially right in the placing of its sympathies, 
and having enough of sentimental interest to hold 
the att«ntion of romantically-inclined readers. 

Dr. James Ball Navlor is not exactly inspired 
by the genius of romantic fiction, but he contrives 
to tell a fairly readable story of the conventional 
sort. " In the Days of St. Clair," a story of the 
early settlers in the Ohio Valley, is carefully studied 
from the sources, and presents a moving picture of 
pioneer hardships and desperate Indian encounters. 
It has a noticeable melodramatic cast, and the vil- 
lain has all the familiar attributes of his type, 
whether displayed on or off the stage. The element 
of humor is supplied by a negro servant, but the 
writer would have been better advised had he re- 
sisted the temptation to be humorous. 

" The Maidat-Arms." by Mr. Robert W. Cham- 
bers, may almost be described as '■ Cardigan " over 
again. The hero this time is a Southerner, the time 
is a year or two later, and Sir William Johnson is 
dead, but otherwise the story is almost a replica of 
parts of the earlier one. Mr. Chambers has shown 
good judgment in his choice of a model, for " Car- 
digan " is the strongest of his novels, but an author 
is hardly justified in repeating himself so closely. 
The story is admirable, romantic in feeling and in- 
cident, exciting in its complications, and satisfactory 
in its outcome. 

Mr. Richard Bagot, in " The Just and the Un- 
just,'' has turned from the field of Catholic contro- 
versy in fiction to the portrayal of secular English 
society. His novel contrasts two familiar types 
of women, the one who. while preserving the out- 
ward conventionalities, is morally corrupt to the 
core, and the one who remains essentially gen- 
erous and high-minded in spite of a deliberate lapse 
from virtuous living. The comparison is all in favor 
of the latter woman, and the author has done his 
best to enlist our sympathies and our admiration in 



her behalf. The situation thus described is no doubt 
possible, but it is certainly the exceptional case, and 
we cannot help feeling that such a portrayal illus- 
trates the most insidious form of immorality in fic- 
tion. It is a favorite device of novelists to present 
this problem in this way, but it represents a reaction 
that has been carried too far. This particular novel 
is of the well-bred sort, written in the best of taste 
as far as the details are concerned, but clearly open 
to criticism on account of its main idea. Although 
for the most part a well-written book, there are now 
and then grammatical lapses of an astonishing sort, 
blunders that are obvioosly the result of an occa- 
sional moment of eareleasneas rather than of defec- 
tive educational equipment. 

A more hapless piece of fiction than " Luck o' 
Lassendale " it is not often the lot of the reviewer 
to encounter. It is the work of the Earl of Iddes- 
leigh, but even the name of a " noble lord " cannot 
save so inane and dreary a story from speedy ob- 
livion. Those who read it will silently wonder how 
such a performance ever found its way into print, 
and proceed to forget all about it as quickly as pos- 
sible. How Sir Francis Lassendale, wishing to en- 
large the fortune left him by his father's death, 
plunged into stock speculation, became a company 
promoter, and speedily made ducks and drakes of 
all his property, is the story, if such it may be 
called, of this volume. There is throughout the 
book neither a character nor a scene that betokens 
the author's possession of the novelist's talent in its 
most rudimentary form. 

" The Vultures " is the latest, and in some re- 
spects the most successful, of Mr. Henry Seton Mer- 
riman'g novels. He seems to have carried about 
to its extreme limit his peculiar method of terse 
narrative, which strips away all surplusage, and 
requires the reader at every step to make his im- 
agination react upon the material offered, in order 
to supply what a less skilful novelist would write 
out at length. This method certainly compels strict 
attention to the business at hand, and when com- 
bined, as in the present instance, with a plot of 
remarkably ingenious construction, it produces the 
best sort of story of the merely entertaining sort. 
The scene is mainly in Warsaw, and the story has 
to do with the plotting of the irreconcilable Polish 
contingent It leads eventually, although in indi- 
rect fashion, to the historical assassination of the 
Ciar Liberator. It derives its title from the groups 
of diplomats who figure among the chief charac- 
ters, and who, scenting the coming disturbances, 
are brought together in Warsaw at the critical time. 
One of them, the attacM of the English Foreign 
OflBce, is the hero of the novel, and his love for 
the beautiful Polish Countess, the daughter of the 
arch-conspirator, affords the chief romantic interest 
of the book. Mr. Merriman has the excellent habit 
of studying upon the spot the scenes of his novels, 
which enables him to do the descriptive parts with 
close truthfulness.

is a novel that turns out to be about the way of a 
woman for the naost part. She is the sort of 
woman whom most men would describe as typ- 
ically feminine in her conduct, while most women, 
bearing this ascription, would indignantly repudiate 
it on behalf of their sex. She is a very lively young 
English girl who yearns for experiences and gets 
them. She also yearns for a lover who can do things, 
and she gets him too, — in the person of the revolu- 
tionary president of a two-penny Spanish- American 
republic. Meanwhile, the poor stockbroker's clerk, 
whom she has fired with unholy ambitions, and dis- 
patched to Central America to perform deeds of 
daring for her sake, learns that his best achieve- 
ments make but a poor showing in contrast with 
those of a political brigand to the manner born. 
The story is of the liveliest interest, and the heroine 
is as charming as she is impulsive and irrational. 

Mr. Alexander Glovatski, the Polish novelist 
whom Mr. Jeremiah Curtin now introduces to 
the American public with a translation of " The 
Pharaoh and the Priest," is already a veteran man 
of letters in his own country. His works of fiction 
occupy no less than seventeen volumes, most of 
which are devoted to modern Polish life, its char- 
acters, situations, and questions. The novel now 
translated offers the sole exception to this state- 
ment, being a historical study of the Egypt of three 
thousand years ago, under the rule of Rameses XII. 
and XIII. We presume that Mr. Curtin had good 
reasons for making this selection, but it is not usual 
to introduce a new author by means of the least 
typical of his works. Just how many of Mr. Glo- 
vatski's seventeen volumes are required to contain 
the present study we are not informed. The trans- 
lation is given us in a single thick volume of about 
seven hundred pages, and must comprise consider- 
ably more than three hundred thousand words. It 
is swollen to this colossal bulk by many repetitions, 
vast and arid tracts of erudition, passages from the 
Egyptian ritual, and whatever other matter the 
author was able to press into the service. It is well- 
nigh unreadable in other than a cursory fashion, 
yet it undoubtedly presents a vivid picture of a 
critical period in Egyptian history. The period is 
that of the decay of the empire under the last of 
the kings named Rameses, and the establishment 
of the new line of rulers with the accession of the 
priest Herhor. The main theme of the whole work 
is the desperate struggle of Rameses XIII. to over- 
come the encroachments of the priesthood, replenish 
the exhausted treasury, and restore the glories of 
the line of rulers of which he is the last representa- 
tive. How he fails through impulsiveness and lack 
of the subtlety needed to cope successfully with the 
devices of priestcraft, falling at length under the 
dagger of an assassin, is what this work brings us 
at its climax. It is a chaotic production, yet it has 
undeniable power in places, and exhibits undeniable 
learning throughout. It seems to us to accomplish 
more successfully than the novels of Ebers the diffi- 
cult task of presenting, not merely Egyptian scenes, 



customs, and historical episodes, but also Egyptian 
modes of thinking. We should say that this was 
its chief claim upon our consideration. 

Reports from Continental Europe have for some 
time past made much account of a great historical 
trilogy by the Russian writer Professor Dimitri 
Merejkowski. The general theme of this work, as 
suggested by the title " Christ and Antichrist," is 
the fundamental antagonism between the Pagan 
and Christian ideals, and the three several sections 
of the work focus our attention, respectively, upon 
the three figures of Julian the Apostate, Leonardo 
da Vinci, and Peter the Great. The entire series 
has found an English translator in Mr. Herbert 
Trench, and two of the three volumes have already 
been offered to the English-reading public. When 
the first volume, " The Death of the Gods," came 
to our attention last year, we found it disappointing. 
It made a great display of erudition, and the char- 
acter of the emperor was finely conceived ; but the 
sum total of the effect was confusing, and the author 
seemed incapable of infusing with life the dry bones 
of his scholarship. The second volume of the series 
is now at hand, and is here styled " The Romance 
of Leonardo da Vinci the Forerunner," although 
" The Resurrection of the Gods " is the author's 
own chosen title. We have now no reason to with- 
hold the praise that we were ready to bestow, but 
could not, upon the earlier volume. Here, at least, 
is a work planned upon a generous scale, displaying 
vital power as well as scholarship, and deserving 
of an enthusiastic welcome. It is a work that com- 
pletely dwarfs the ordinary historical romance by 
the richness of its contents and the depth of its lit- 
erary and artistic sympathies. Essentially the book 
is a spiritualized biography of Leonardo during the 
last twenty-five years of his life. Whether it be 
the real Leonardo that the author has drawn for us 
no man may say. What may safely be said is that 
no previous portrait has been made that so impresses 
the reader with the stamp of truthfulness, or that 
so successfully creates the illusion that he is indeed 
in the presence of the great artist, the great thinker, 
and the great explorer of the mysteries of nature. 
The records of Leonardo's life, and the voluminous 
manuscripts that he left for posterity to decipher 
and set in order, have been minutely and lovingly 
explored by the author, and every characteristic 
touch or fragment that would seem to illuminate 
his complex personality has been deftly worked 
into the narrative. The result is a truly marvel- 
lous exposition of both the inner and the outer life 
of the man, an exposition that saddens us by the 
pathos of constantly thwarted effort, and uplifts as 
by the contemplation of a character that seems to 
have been absolutely free from the petty faults of 
ordinary humanity, absolutely noble in its motive 
and aspiration. More than this, the book is a sec- 
tion of the history of culture in one of the most 
pregnant epochs in the life of the human spirit. It 
embraces in its span (1494-1519) kings, popes, and 
tyrants, Savonarola and Macchiavelli, Michelangelo

and Raphael, the bonfire of vanities, the papal par- 
tition of the globe, and the French invasion of 
Lonabardy. The superstition of the age, its licen- 
tiousness in high places, the shame of its politics, 
and the glory of its art, all find places npon this 
richly-colored canvas. And all are brought into 
relations with the calm thinker — dispassionate in 
the ordinary sense, yet the very incarnation of the 
passion of the intellect — whose career gives unity 
to the historical picture, whose view of life is ever 
sub specie aetemitatis, and whose sublime specula- 
tions transcend the age that gives them birth. The 
Russian author has been most fortunate in his 
English translator. The work reads like an original 
production ; its style matches the elevation of its 
theme, and fits itself with peculiar flexibility to the 
varied interests and moods that the author's treat- 
ment demands. We notice on the first page a slip 
in the use of the word "corrosive" where " mordant" 
is meant, and again, in the story of the papal parti- 
tion, the awards to Spain and Portugal are given 
as the reverse of what they actually were.

Briefs on Xew Books. 



A peep into topsyturvydom is offered 
'^^j^^^ us in Mr. G. K. Chesterton's latest 

volume of essayettes, " The Defend- 
ant" (Dodd). But, curiously enough, it is this 
plain, prosaic old world of everyday life that is 
upside down ; we have been standing on our heads 
and never once suspecting it. The sixteen little 
chapters that demonstrate this are called '* De- 
fences" — of nonsense, of ugly things, of slang, of 
useful [i.e., useless] information, of penny-dreadfuls, 
of farce, of skeletons, of planets, and of other things 
which have hitherto been regarded as either need- 
ing no defense or unworthy of one. Amid much 
that is sane and suggestive, as well as piquant 
and delightful, these brief treatises contain other 
things that are merely odd and whimxical. Penny- 
dreadfuls are unduly lauded, and it is denied that 
their purple hues are productive of moral color- 
blindness in the juvenile reader. Slang is exalted 
to the level of poetry. " All slang is metaphor, and 
all metaphor is poetry." But the cis- Atlantic reader 
will be pleased to find American slang held in 
high esteem. The Yankee's remark, that after the 
Chinese War the Japanese had to use a shoe-horn 
in putting on their hats, is quoted as ■' a monument 
of the true nature of slang, which consists in get- 
ting further and further away from the original 
conception, in treating it more and more as an as- 
sumption. It is rather like the literary doctrine 
of the Symbolists." The closing chapter, "A De- 
fence of Patriotism," is a witty assault on jingoism. 
" My country, right or wrong," the author declares 
to be no less absurd and shocking than '■ My mother, 



drunk or sober." Again, " Colonies are things to 
be proud of, but for a country to be only proud of 
its extremities is like a man being only proud of his 
legs." 

Mr. Stanley Waterloo has edited 
ij^M^Mu " The Story of a Strange Career, 

Being the Autobiography of a Crim- 
inal" (Appleton); and such disap[>ointment as the 
reader will unquestionably feel when he comes to 
the abrupt termination of the history, before the 
writer has turned criminal at all, is doubtless doe to 
the editor's brief introduction and to the sub-title 
selected for the work. Thompson is the fictitious 
name assigned the antobiographer, and the editor 
has made few changes in his narrative beyond those 
needed to guard the personalities of the innocent. 
Going to sea with his father's full consent when still 
a lad, Thompson was wrongfully arrested for mur- 
dering the captain of bis ship during his first voy- 
age. Being acquitted after a long stay in jail, he 
became a sailor of the irresponsible sort, working 
hard, enlisting in the British navy to escape an 
abominable merchant ship and deserting as soon as 
possible, marrying two women who proved to have 
husbands living and undivorced, and finally obtain- 
ing a commission in the navy of the United States 
at the outbreak of the war between the States, only 
to fall into Confederate hands and remain impris- 
oned until the war was nearly ended. There, two, 
the story ends, — though Mr. Waterloo assures his 
readers that the man's life was henceforth passed 
in one or another of the State penitentiaries. The 
book is as sincere as possible, and written with a sim- 
plicity and directness that deserve commendation ; 
but it would have been more interesting if something 
had been said of prison-life from the point of view 
of a man well-born and not uneducated. 



Under the tide "The Theory of Pros- 
t/p^^^'^' perity" (Macmillan). Professor Pat- 
ten, of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania, has presented the familiar principles of 
Exsonomics in a novel manner, and has added many- 
new and unique phases of the science. The main 
features of the book are found in the extension 
of the scope of economic thought, making it far 
more subjective than is customary among the older 
economists, and in the elucidation of the prin- 
ciples of social well-being rather than of the ordi- 
nary principles of wealth-getting. The economic 
purpose is to show that the evils of poverty arise 
not from the lack of goods but from the misuse of 
goods. The author ptoints out distinctively that the 
old differences between " landlord," " manager," 
" capitalist," and " laborer " are becoming obliter- 
ated, and that the terms " rent," " profit," " inter- 
est," and "wages" cease to be clear demarcations 
of income. He treats economic society more as a 
single entity, without distinctive productive or dis- 
tributive classes ; but he is clear in defining the 
rights and duties and privileges of all people en-

gaged in the economic processes of life. His theory 
of property is, to a certain extent, a philosophy of 
right living. In the chapter entitled " Work and 
Play," he approaches the great subjects of utility, 
cost, value, price, surplus, and wages in a novel 
way ; but the reader recognizes familiar forms 
clothed in new garments. Under " Monopoly Ad- 
vantage," the author discusses market prices, their 
rise and fall, and the differential advantages of the 
rising of monopolistic power ; and the conclusion is 
reached that " monopoly is a problem not of values 
but of prices." The second part of the book is de- 
voted to " Income as Determined by Heredity." 
Here the author branches further away from the 
main principles of conventional economics, and en- 
ters the ideas of social well-being. In the last 
chapter, on " Income as Modified by Economic 
Rights," he gives what he considers the source of 
rights, and then proceeds to analyze various cate- 
gories of rights, fiuch as " Public or Market Rights," 
•' Social Rights," and " Rights of Leisure." In the 
discussion of the source of rights, the author fails 
to make himself clear as to the real origin of rights; 
but he insists that " It is not, therefore, from a 
theory of distribution that a solution of present dif- 
ficulties will come, but from a better formulation of 
the moral code and from a clearer perception of the 
common rights that new impulses and ideals 
evoke." In his discussion he makes economic rights 
something more than freedom of choice and justice, 
but appears to base them on the economic well-being 
of man. The book is thoughtful and suggestive, 
like all of Professor Patten's writings. 

Having achieved a reputation as a 
Ah.umori,c. view humorist, Mr. John Kendrick Bangs 

Of Amertca %n Cuba. , , ■, ■» 

labors under the disadvantage of 
'not being regarded very seriously by the public. 
Unfortunately, he himself seems not always or 
altogether certain whether he is serious or not ; 
and his new book, "Uncle Sam, Trustee" (Riggs 
Publishing Co.), is apparently named in that un- 
certain spirit. Unfortunately, too, Mr. Bangs has 
here seen fit to make merry at the expense of those 
who are holding before the American people the 
ideals upon which the nation was founded, basing 
his rather sorry jests upon foundations so slight 
that the dignity of his work is seriously impaired. 
The volume is devoted to a showing of what the 
American occupation has been able to accomplish 
in the cities of Santiago and Havana, Mr. Bangs 
assuming that in some way this is bearing out the 
national pledge, voluntarily given, to occupy the 
island for no purpose save that of pacification. By 
dint of laying stress on all the real good that was 
accomplished — and of course there was a great 
deal of it — and keeping silence in regard to all 
the harm done, Mr. Bangs succeeds in proving that 
a beneficent despotism is the ideal government for 
practical results : a conclusion sufficiently obvious 
before, but one that sounds a little curious when 
elevated, as in this case, into an American ideal by

an American. Perhaps it is best to remember that 
the author is, after all, a humorist. Cuba is to-day, 
if official reports are to be trusted, in a rather bad 
way through the cupidity of certain American in- 
terests. In the face of that sorry truth, it does not 
become any American to flaunt the national ensign 
in the face of the world as a complete reply to the 
strictures of idealists. " Plain duty," pac& Mr. 
Bangs, has been made a little less obvious by his 
writing here, and his attitude is to be regretted 
accordingly. 

Two little books by Mr. Hamilton 
Wright Mabie, " Works and Days " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) and " Parables 
of Life" (The Outlook Co.), come to us with the 
gracefully phrased wisdom of a genial man of 
letters. The first is a collection of brief essays on 
every-day subjects, with which readers of "The 
Outlook " are familiar. Their fine note of serenity 
and cheerfulness will make the volume companion- 
able for those to whom the messages are not new, 
as well as to others. It is a book to be picked up 
at a chance moment, almost no contribution going 
beyond the length of half-a-dozen pages. — The vol- 
ume entitled "Parables of Life" is more decidedly 
literary in method and manner, and there is in it 
more suggestion of artificiality. The parables are 
managed with the felicity and grace that we very 
properly expect of Mr. Mabie, but they seem some^ 
how a little cloying to the taste. Perhaps it is be- 
cause we are now rather unwilling to bother with 
anything but actualities themselves, and the thin 
disguise of a parable seems a useless sort of pretti- 
ness. There are eleven of these essays in all, cover- 
ing various phases of life from childhood to old 
age. They have a pleasant savor of good-sense 
and wisdom, and if they sometimes incline to 
preaching over-much, the preaching is good and 
wholesome. The volume, a product of the De Vinne 
press, is a delight to the eye, with its wide margins 
and elegantly simple binding in brown cloth and 
paper. 

Nuremberg, " Albert Durer's and 
Hans Sachs' City," was also from 
1450 to 1549 the city of the Vis- 
chers, — a family of bronze founders, who, in inter- 
preting the teaching of other and greater artists of 
other lands, impressed upon their work an original 
power and individuality of their own. They were 
then, and are still, called " craftsmen." Were 
they living now, they would perhaps give the work 
of the foundry into the hands of others, devote 
their time and attention to the work of modelling 
and designing, and be known as sculptors. In the 
history of German art, their work represents the 
transition from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. 
The members of this renowned family were Her- 
mann Vischer, his son Peter, and Peter's sons — 
Hermann, Peter, and Hans. Peter Vischer the 
elder lends his name as a title to a volume of the 
"Great Craftsmen Series" (Macmillan); but the

with a higher place in the craft, and finds his

at Insbruck, worthy of comparison with the su- 
preme triumph of Renaissance sculpture, Dona- 
tello's St. George. To emphasize the value of this 
book as a contribution to the series of " Great 
Craftsmen." it needs but to add that the author, 
Mr. Cecil Headlam, has written " The Story of Nu- 
remberg,'' and that he does not disappoint us when 
he turns his attention to some of Nuremberg's 

famous sons. 

Buuimand Two interesting folk-tales relating 

Frmeh/otk-iaia to Napoleon I., translated into col- 
abmt Sapoiem I. JoqQial English and furnished with 
a discriminating Introduction by Mr. George Ken- 
nan, are published together in a volume by 
The Outlook Co. The first tale, entitled "Napo- 
leonder," is a Russian story, edited or put into lit- 
erary form by Alexander Araphiteatrof of St. 
Petersburg, and published in December, 1901, in 
the St. Petersburg " Gazette." The other tale was 
written by Honor ^ de Balzac, and is supposed to 
be the story of Napoleon told by one of his old 
soldiers to a group of French peasants. Doubtless 
the unprejudiced reader will be disposed to agree 
with Mr. Kennan, that the Russian story is de- 
cidedly the better of the two. To quote from the 
Introduction, " The French peasant regards Napo- 
leon merely as a great leader and conqueror, created 
to be the father of soldiers, and aided, if not di- 
rectly sent, by God, to show forth the power and 
glory of France. The Russian peasant, more 
thoughtful by nature as well as less excitable and 
combative in temperament, admits that Napoleon 
was sent on earth by God, but connects him with 
one of the deep problems of life by using him to 
show the divine nature of sympathy and pity, and 
the cruelty, immorality, and unreasonableness of 
aggressive war." But to those familiar with the 
beginning of the Book of Job and with the pro- 
logue to Goethe's " Faust," the apology for the 
seeming irreverence of the Russian story appears 
hardly necessary. The reading of these stories 
will in any case prove a pleasant diversion, and 
their comparison a profitable task. 

Mr. Herbert W. Tompkins prefers 
^Ty.' " '• Sainte Terrer"— the " holy-lander" 

or pious pilgrim — to sans terre — 
homeless or without house — as the proper origin 
of the verb " to saunter." He declares that true 
sauntering is an art that may be cultivated, and he 
finds the highways and byways in Hertfordshire 
admirable for its cultivation. Mr. Tompkins ob- 
serves everything as he lightly passes along, — the 
characteristics of village architecture, little details 
in the churches that would escape the attention of 
most wayfarers, curious epitaphs in the church- 
yards or inscriptions on stone buildings, the tumuli 
of primitive man, barrows of Danish origin, relics 



of the Roman occupation, and the botany and 
natural history of each locality, — and he writes of 
all of them in such manner that his reader sees 
them too, and takes also a keen delight in the see- 
ing. He knows, besides, a long list of names of 
English worthies who were either born in Hert- 
fordshire or at one time lived there, and the reader 
shares his interest as he passes through a village of 
which any of them were native or with which they 
were in any manner associated. The book is 
charmingly illustrated by Mr. Frederic Gregg, 
who well knows the artistic and illustrative value 
of a line. Thus Hertfordshire furnishes materials 
for a valuable contribution to the charming " High- 
ways and Byways Series" (Macmillan). 

Daily life m "^^^ recent war between Spain and 

Spain and the United States left no such ani- 

PertugaL mosities behind it in either country 

as that the American globe-trotter might not find a 
hearty welcome in Spain, or desire to make up 
what might be deficient in his knowledge of the 
Iberian Peninsula. A book on Spain is therefore 
timely. To the series of "Our European Neigh- 
bors" (Putnam), Louis Higgin is enabled, by a 
residence of many years in Spain, to contribute a 
very readable and informing book on '■ Spanish 
Life in Town and Country." We are prevented 
from assuming the work to be written by a man, 
by the incidental mention of something that hap- 
ptened in the author's girlhood. It is, however, 
written in an exceedingly pleasing style, and no 
phase of Spanish life is overlooked or neglected. 
Portugal, like and yet in many respects unlike 
Spain as it is, is deemed not important enough to 
warrant a separate volume, and two chapters on 
Portuguese life — "Land and People" and "Por- 
tuguese Institutions " — are added by Mr. Eugene 
£. Street, that the book may present a complete 
view of the Iberian Peninsula. It is to be heartily 
commended for the enlargement of popular ideas 
on the subject of Spain and Portugal. 

Half a dozen slender chapters on 
l ui ^iUfuumf ^® pleasures of trout-fishing, one on 

wild-duck shooting, three on other 
rural themes, and a translation of one of Erckmann- 
Chatrian's shorter stories, make up the Rev. 
James B. Kenyon's second volume of prose sketches, 
which he has named " Remembered Days " (Eaton 
& Mains). The little poem that precedes these 
chapters forms not the least pleasing feature of the 
book, whose subsequent pages show a somewhat 
florid style clothing an amount of matt«r that is 
not, and doubtless was not meant to be, stupendous. 
But aquiet humor, an observant eye, a poetic fancy, 
and a pure delight in country life, are the author's 
precious possessions, and his book has something of 
the breezy freshness of the scenes that inspired it. 
The most quaintly-amusing character in the volume 
is Uncle John, who was so tender-hearted toward 
all creation, vegetable as well as animal, that it hurt

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Most text books of elementary English claim to be 
practical, but few of them really justify the claioi. 
One of the few is "A Text- Book of Applied English 
Grammar" (Macmillan), by Dr. Edwin Herbert Lewis, 
whose previously-published school books in English 
have met with deserved favor. Here is a book that is 
practical in the best and fullest sense, and is calculated 
to make the subject really interesting (given a good 
teacher) to juvenile minds. There are great numbers 
of exercises, some of them happily based upon well- 
known pictures, and all skilfully devised to develop the 
immature reasoning powers of children. This book 
seems to us one of the best for its purpose that have 
ever been produced. 

The George H. Ellis Co., Boston, publish a pamphlet 
entitled " Secretary Root's Record," or " Marked 
Severities in the Philippine Warfare." It is a careful 
analysis, by two distinguished lawyers, Messrs. Moor- 
field Storey and Julian Codman, of the utterances of the 
Secretary of War concerning the crimes committed by 
American soldiers in the Philippine Islands. Every 
statement made is supported by convincing evidence, 
and the record as a whole convicts Mr. Root of fre- 
quent misrepresentations, suppressions of the truth, 
and deliberate attempts to gloss over the use of torture 
in extracting confessions, and other atrocious practices. 
It is diflBcult to see how any effective reply can be 
made to this scathing denunciation. 

In preparing his " Handbook of Best Readings " 
(Scribner), Professor S. H. Clark of the University of 
Chicago has contrived to run the gamut, from work 
suited to the commonest uses of the professional elocu- 
tionist up to the accepted classics of the language in both 
prose and verse. Coming from such a source, there 
should have been some practical acceptance of literary 
standards and a refusal to recognize sentimentality and 
mere fudge, and we are sorry to observe the sort of 
companionship which is here thrust upon the really good 
literature that makes up a considerable portion of the 
Tolnme. 

It is somewhat daring for anyone after Mr. Stedman 
to prepare " An Anthology of Victorian Poetry " 
(Dutton), yet this is what Sir Mountstuart £. Grant 
Duff has done. He apologizes for it by saying that it 
presents merely the personal equation of his own likings, 
which hardly needed to be said. When he goes further, 
and claims that all other anthologies do the same thing, 
he ignores the fact that there is such a thing as expert 
judgment of poetry, and that the best anthology must 
be the one that most completely keeps the compiler's 
tastes in the background. We do not particularly care 
for the personal equation in such a work unless it is the 
equation of a remarkable personality, as in the case of 
Emerson's " Parnassus." For the rest. Sir Mountstuart 
has made up for us a volume of excellent reading, and 
his taste is usually in the line of good critical opinion. 
His somewhat naive comments upon the poets might 
just as well have been omitted.

EMILE ZOLA. 



Had Emile Zola died ten years ago, the 
verdict of criticism upon his work would have 
been substantially different from what it must 
be to-day. A false theory of art, applied to 
his material with amazing industry but per- 
verse ingenuity, would have been the formula 
for the summing up of his remarkable activity, 
and little could have been urged in behalf of 
his claims to literary immortality. He would 
have stood as an awful example of doctrinaire 
method and of the dangers of excessive photo- 
graphic realism. That he was a close observer 
of life could not have been denied, and that the 
accumulation of unimportant detail character- 
istic of his writing had a certain bludgeon-like 
power in its assault upon his readers would 
have been freely admitted ; but it would have 
been difficult to escape the conclusion that all 
this energy had been essentially misdirected, 
and that all the mass of the Rougon-Macquart 
chronicles had little of the penetrating and en- 
during quality that makes of literature in the 
true sense one of the most effective forces in 
the bands of men. To quote an epigram that 
was current a score of years ago, " L'Assom- 
moir " was assommant, simply that, unless we 
add it was also repulsive and disgusting to the 
finer sensibilities. 

Recent developments, we are bound to say, 
have made necessary a quite new estimate of 
Zola's work. It is not merely his self-sacrificing 
devotion to the cause of truth and justice, 38 
displayed in the celebrated affaire of a few 
years ago, that has attracted attention to as- 
pects of his character but dimly realized be- 
fore. That is what has chiefly impressed the 
multitude, but the careful reader of his recent 
work has come to understand that the outburst 
in question was symptomatic of a general 
broadening of his outlook, and to suspect the 
passionate idealism thus brought to the surface 
has been potential in his character all along, 
although for the most part sternly suppressed 
in the interest of what we have already styled 
a false theory of art. Rereading his earlier 
novels in the light of his later ones, as well as 
in the light of his public acts, we discover in 
them things that we never saw before, glimpses 



282 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



of the larger aspects of truth that he so stu- 
diously sought to conceal, glints of sunlight 
struggling to make their way through the fog 
and suggestive of the glories beyond. From 
the position of the dispassionate scientific ob- 
server he has come to assume something of the 
position of the prophet, and his utterances have 
gained immensely in weight and authority. 

Emile Zola was born in Paris in 1840, the 
year also of Daudet's birth. In his blood there 
was a mingling of three strains, French, Ven- 
etian, and Greek. His boyhood years were 
spentmostly at Aix (the Plassans of his fiction), 
but at the age of eighteen, the family fortunes 
having collapsed, he went back to the city of 
his birth. After a year or two more of school- 
ing which proved unsuccessful, owing to his 
pronounced dislike of the classics which were 
the staple of thelycee instruction, he was thrown 
upon his own resources. The following years 
were years of wretched poverty, and his literary 
apprenticeship was made under difficult condi- 
tions, much like those that attended the early 
struggles of Daudet to obtain a foothold as an 
author. He wrote poems, short stories, and 
newspaper articles, then the series of six early 
novels which ended with "Therese Raquin" 
and " Madeleine Ferat." These books prepared 
the way for the famous Rougon-Macquart series 
to which he gave the next quarter- century of his 
life. 

This stupendous undertaking, in magnitude 
comparable only with " La Comedie Humaine," 
was thought out in its general plan almost from 
the beginning, and the imaginary genealogy of 
the whole series was devised with the inception 
of the first volume. The author's purpose was 
to do for the Second Empire what Balzac had 
done for the Restoration period, to write the 
natural history of French society in all of its 
phases and developments. With this object in 
view, he imagined a family whose members iu 
several generations were to represent all the 
principal types of life and occupation — their 
lives seemingly diverse, yet linked together by 
the mysterious tie of a common heredity, and 
illustrating in all of its manifestations an 
"overweening appetite, that general modern 
impulse that snatches at enjoyment and inter- 
penetrates our whole social body." It was a 
magnificent scheme, and the completed series 
of volumes stands as one of the most magnifi- 
cent monuments of contemporary French liter- 
ature. 

When the undertaking was outlined, the 
author could not foresee that the Empire itself 



was tottering to a shameful end, and in its 
execution he thus became involved in grave 
chronological difficulties. His scheme had as- 
sumed a much longer term than the brief nine- 
teen years allotted by the fates for that ill- 
starred experiment in imperialism, and he 
pursued his course without attempting the re- 
construction that would have been required by 
a strict conformity to historical fact. The 
twenty volumes to which the series extended 
are of very uneven excellence, and have had 
varying fortunes. The earlier novels attracted 
no more than a moderate degree of attention, 
but with the publication of " L'Assommoir " 
the author burst into the full light of notoriety 
and of at least a qualified fame. The volumes 
that have received the most praise, besides the 
one just mentioned, are " Germinal," a prose 
epic of the mine, " La Debacle," a vivid pre- 
sentation of the War of 1870, " Le Reve," a 
masterpiece of mystical beauty, and " La Faute 
de 1 'Abbe Mouret," which is perhaps the most 
artistic of all the twenty. Among the compara- 
tive failures may be mentioned " Le Ventre de 
Paris," " Pot-Bouille," " L'Argent," "La Cou- 
quete de Plassans," and " Dr. Pascal," the final 
volume of the series. 

Nearly half of these twenty volumes deal 
with the most degraded aspects of life, and por- 
tray the various forms of vice and bestiality 
with an unsparing pen. When it came to the 
practice of his theory, he was unflinching, and 
the foulness of such books as " La Terre " and 
" La Bete Humaine " naturally gives much 
offense to the reader of artistic sensibilities. 
Whether Zola can be wholly acquitted of the 
charge of having deliberately and of set purpose 
pandered to the most depraved tastes of his 
readers is doubtful ; what is certain is that his 
great vogue in the eighties was due in no small 
measure to the most repulsive characteristics 
of his works. And yet — strange contradic- 
tiou ! — he could follow up the vilest of his 
pages with such a revelation of tender and 
spiritual beauty as is given us in " Le Reve," a 
book that has no suggestion of sensual stain, 
and transports us into the loftiest realm of the 
ideal. His own answer to the charge laid 
against him was, of course, that he depicted 
life as he found it, that he described nothing 
that he had not observed, that reticence must 
be a virtue unknown to the roman experimen- 
tal. That this is the supreme virtue in all 
great and enduring art is a lesson that he never 
learned. 

Some sort of comparison is inevitable be-

THE DIAIi

limited edition of the Robiiiy^t, printed on handmade 
paper and on vellum, with decorative borders by 
Mr. Louis B. Coley. 

" The Fascination of London" is the collective title 
of a series of small volumes published by the 
Macmillan Co. They are the joint work of the late 
Walter Besant and Mr. G. E. Mitton, and comprise four 
nambers, devoted respectively to Chelsea, Westmins- 
ter, the Strand District, and Hampstead. 

Mrs. Sara A. Hubbard's " Catch Words of Cheer," 
published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., is in the 
form of a birthday book or diary, each day of the year 
having its cheering thought. Stevenson's " Man does 
not live by bread alone but also by catch words " is the 
motto of this exceptionally dainty little volume. 

Readers of " The Outlook " have learned to have a 
kindly feeling for the " Spectator " whose weekly ob- 
servations have long constituted one of the interesting 
features of that journal. To such, and others, the 
volume called "Seen by the Spectator," a reprint of 
selections just published by the Outlook Co., will be 
welcome. 

To their series of " Little Histories of Art " Messrs. 
A. W. Elson & Co. have added a monograph on 
" Italian Painting " by Prof. John C. Van Dyke. For 
those who wish an outline sketch of the subject, in the 
briefest form possible, nothing better could be found 
than this little essay. Five photogravure plates of ex- 
cellent quality supplement the text. 

Dr. J. Lesslie Hall's translation, rhythmical and 
moderately alliterative, of "Judith, Phoenix, and Other 
Anglo-Saxon Poems " (Silver), continues the good work 
begun by him when he translated the "Beowulf" 
several years ago. The other poems are the " Andreas " 
legend, and the Battles of Maiden and Brunanburk. 
There are brief introductions to the five works, and a 
few foot notes. 

Nothing in American history has had a more pro- 
found effect upon the future of the country than the 
expedition headed by Meriwether Lewis and William 
Clark, which left St. Louis in 1804, passed up to the 
Missouri and over the mountains to the headwaters of 
the Columbia and thence to the Pacific coast, returning 
overland in 1806. This magnificent conception of Pres- 
ident Jefferson has been seized upon by Mrs. Eva Emery 
Dye, of Oregon, as the backbone of a book to be pub- 
lished within a few weeks by A. C. McClurg & Co., 
under the title of " The Conquest." The narrative, 
however, begins with the active life of George Rogers 
Clark, the explorer's elder brother, during the war with 
the Indians provoked by Lord Dunmore in 1774 to dis- 
tract the attention of the rebellious colonists of Vir- 
ginia, follows him through the fighting with the British 
and their savage allies in the revolutionary war along 
the western frontier, and does not end until William 
Clark's death in September, 1838, after he had been at 
the head of Indian affairs of the nation for a full gen- 
eration. This covers the settlement of the United 
States from the tidewaters of the Old Dominion to the 
extreme northwestern corner of its boundaries, and 
enables Mrs. Dye to bring into the scope of her work 
all the deeds of the nation for a period extending over 
sixty-seven of its most vital years. As a result the 
story has the sweep and swing of an epic poem, not all 
the battling before Troy and the wandering of Ulysses 
revealing figures more heroic or deeds of equal conse- 
quence to humanity.

OF INTEREST TO AUTHORS 

ROBERT GRIER COOKE, who was President of The Grafton Press, 
has recently withdrawn from that company, and is now publishing 
under his own name, at 70 Fifth Avenue, New York. Mr. Cooke 
formerly held responsible positions with Harper & Brothers, Collier's 
Weekly, and D. Appleton ,& Co. , and his experience then, and since, in the 
upbuilding of his own business, has given him a very favorable standing 
in the publishing world. It is understood that he is now planning the 
publication of works that will add greatly to the prestige he has already 
won. P. Tecumseh Sherman's book, " Inside the Machine." and John 
Albee's " Remembrances of Emerson," which are among Mr. Cooke's 
earlier publications, and which appear on his list under the new organ- 
ization, are examples of the character of the literature put forth by 
this house.— A'. 1'. Timex Salurilay ReritK.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



AS A WORKING TOOL 

For the student and the writer, as an authoritative reference book for schools, families, and biisiness men, there is one book 
which offers superior advantages both in the solid value of its information, and the ease with which it is obtained. 

One's admiration for Webster's International Dictionary increases daily as it comes to be better known. It never refuses 
the information sought and it never overwhelms one with a mass of misinformation illogically ai'ranged. 

THE ST, JAMES GAZETTE of London, England, uya: For the teacher, the pupil, the student, and the litterateur, there is nothing 
better ; it covers everything. 

The New and Enlarged Edition recently issued has 25,000 new words and phrases, 2.364 pages and 5000 illustrations. 
Our name is on the title-pages of all the authentic dictionaries of the Webster series.

" Mt Dbar Sie : — Inman's Portrait, painted for the Phila. Bar, is the 
only one that was considered by the contemporaries of the great jurist 
as a representative likeness, and your photogravure from the original 
painting reproduces it with exact fidelity of feature and expression. 

*'0f all the very numerous copies, it is by far the best and most 

satisfactory to those who value fidelity of likeness as the prime requisite 

of portraiture. Yours truly,

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 1902. 



Some C urren t Books 

" He delights us without recalling any master of 
the art (parody) whatever. If we think of Thack- 
eray or Bret Harte in perusing tliis little volume, it 
is only to reflect that they would, in all probability, 
have gladly taken him into their company . . . why 
he could not have written all of the works of the 
authors he parodies it is difficult to see, for he 
seems invariably to get inside of them, to write as 
though with their hands and from their brains" 
says the New York Tribune of Owen Seaman's 
BORROWED PLUMES ($1.25). The Boston 
Transcript finds them " full of good things," and 
tlie Baltimore News not only finds them " touched 
with a distinction that is somewhat rare in the field 
of modern parody," but " a corrective in the matter 
of popular taste." 

Anthony Hope seems to have come to stay. His 
DOLLY DIALOGUES now signalizes its seven- 
teenth impression, by appearing in a complete and 
substantially bound edition ($1.50), uniform with 
his Rupert of Hentzau (16th impression). Pris- 
oner of Zenda (55th impression), and Father 
Stafford (7tli impression). This new edition 
contains a frontispiece by Clu-isty. 

Some pretty hard (and perhaps deserved) things 
have recently been said of cm-rent fiction, but they 
scarcely can apply to Miss Godfrey's THE WIND- 
ING ROAD (now in its second impression, $1.50), 
which has been praised with startling unanimity by 
such authorities as The Dial, The Nation, The 
Critic. The Bookman, The Times' Saturday Be- 
veiw, the N. Y. Tribune, The Outlook, etc. 

A vivid and remarkably impartial picture of our 
early politics is given by Prof. J. P. Gordy in the 
first two volumes of his POLITICAL HISTORY 
OF THE UNITED STATES (each $1.75 net, 
postage 14 cents). Vol. I. (1783-1809) furnishes 
a well-rounded history of the Federal period, while 
the most striking features of Vol. II. (1809-28) 
are the financial side of the War of 1812 and the 
curiously similar attitude of the North and the South 
toward the negro in those early years. The third 
and fom-th volumes when completed will bring the 
work down to Hayes's election. The Nation says 
this book " may be reatl not only by beginners but 
by almost anybody with profit," while The Neiv 
York Sun speaks of " this admirable work " and 
says that our political history " has never been re- 
counted in a more fair-minded way." 

Our political life in New York to-day and in 
Washington in the eighties, is vividly pictured in 
two standard novels, THE HONORABLE PETER 
STIRLING (45th impression, $1.50) and DE- 
MOCRACY (16th impression, $1.00).

A History of the 
American People 

In Five Volumes 

By WOODROW WILSON, Ph.D., Litt.D., LL.D. 

President of Princeton University 

PEESIDENT WOODROW WILSON has devoted the 
best years of his life to the preparation of his great 
work, "A History of the American People," from the earliest 
times to the accession of President Theodore Roosevelt. The 
work, which is just completed, is monumental in character 
and scope, represents the genius of the greatest historical 
thinker of modern times, and is written in that delightfully 
flowing style which makes it read like a romance. It is 
printed from new type specially cast in 1902. 

In the matter of illustration, every field of human activity 
has been searched, and hundreds upon hundreds of new 
portraits, prints, maps, plans, and pictures make the pictorial 
features alone tell their wonderful story of the finding of 
the continent and the birth and growth of what is the 
United States of America. There is a photogravure frontis- 
piece to each volume, and portraits in India tint and black. 
It is a curious fact that there is not a single complete 
narrative history of the United States in existence to-day. 
Dr. Woodrow Wilson's is the first. It is bound in dark 
blue leather stamped vellum, lettered with gold, untrimmed 
edges, gilt tops, etc. The edition is in five volumes and the 
price is $25.00.

HARPER'S NEW FICTION 



THE MAID-AT-ARMS. By Robert W. Chambers. 

Mr. Chambers has long since won a most enviable position among contemporary Dovelists. The 
great popular success of " Cardigan " makes this present novel of unusual interest to all readers 
of fiction. It is a stirring novel of American life in days during the Revolution. It deals with 
the conspiracy of the great New York laud-owners and the subjugation of New York Province 
to the British. It is a story with a fascinating love interest, and is alive with exciting incident and 
adventure. Some of the characters of "Cardigan " reappear in this new novel. Illustrated by 
Christy. $1.50. 

THE SHIP OF DREAMS. By Louise Forsslund, author of "The story 

of Sarah," etc. 

Readers of the author's first novel, "The Story of Sarah," will recall that the Dutch settkrs 
around New York played an important part. In this new novel the chief characters are the 
aristocrats — the descendants of the early settlers on Long Island. The consequences of a curse 
upon one of these families is the chief motive of the story. It is a novel that will prove one of 
the most popular of the year. $1.50. 

ISTAR OF BABYLON. By Margaret Horton Potter, author of 'The 

House of de Mailly," etc. 

This is a most interesting novel of the time just before the fall of Babylon, up to and including 
the great feast uf BelshHZzar. Istar is the Babylonian Aphrodite. Around her as the central 
figure the author has written a story of wonderful power. The novel has been described as the 
pagan " Ben Hur." $1.50. 

THE INTRUSIONS OF PEGGY. By Anthony Hope. 

A new novel that combines the brightness of the author's " Dolly Dialogues " with the interest of 
"The Prisoner of Zeuda." It is a story of life to-day in London, with the adventures and love 
affairs of a most charming, ingenuous, and interesting young woman. This novel will be classed 
by readers among Anthony Hope's best work. Illustrated. $1.50. 

THE VULTURES. By Henry Seton Merriman, author of "The 

Sowers," "With Ed£:ed Tools," etc. 

The announcement of a new novel by Henry Seton Merriman will be welcome to every reader of 
fiction. This is an exciting novel of love, adventure, and international intrigue in Russia, etc. 
The attaches of the diplomatic foreign oftices play an important part. It is a story of absorbing 
interest from start to finish. Illustrated. $1.50. 

THE WOOING OF WISTARIA. By Onoto Watanna, author of 

"A Japanese Nightingale," etc. 

This is a new novel by the well- known Japanese author, Onoto Watanna. The scene is in Japan 
and the characters are Japanese. It is a love story, a novel of great power, exceptionally well 
told, with all the poetic charm and feeling that made " A Japanese Nightingale " one of the most 
delightful and popular novels of recent fiction. Frontispiece portrait of author in tint. $1.50. 

WINSLOW PLAIN. By Sarah P. McLean Greene, author of "Flood- 
Tide," "Vesty of the Basins," etc. 

The scene is laid in a quaint little New England village fifty years ago. It is a story of the life 
of that time in New England, with a fascinating love interest told from start to finish with the 
bright, witty optimism and true comedy that all readers eujnyed in the author's "Flood-Tide." 
The work of the author has already met with wide appreciation, both here and abroad. This 
new novel will be received with special interest by all readers. $1 50.

" It is no exaggeration to say that no man living is better qualified to write upon these and kindred topics 
than the author of the ' American Commonwealth.' The essays are all distinguished by that careful, painstak- 
ing research, profound learning, and scrupulous fairness and impartiality that have given Mr. Bryue's previous 
works snch remarkable vogue amung the learned and cultured of both hemispheres. The study entitled * Ham-

The Most Brilliant of American Novels 

THE TENTH COMMANDMENT 

By MARGUERITE LINTON QLENTWORTH, author of "A Twentieth 
Century Boy." With photogravure frontispiece of author. Richly 
bound. Qilt top. Price, $1.50. 

The late Frank R. Stockton, after reading the manuscript of the book, said that it was "bound 
to attract attention for the strength of its characters," and that a single chapter, entitled "A Ship 
has put to Sea," was alone sufficient to make the book a great American novel. 

It is a story of New York life with characters drawn from both the most exclusive circles and 
from "Bohemia" — two distinct social worlds linked by the life of the beautiful heroine. A social 
question of burning intensity is fearlessly handled, but with the utmost purity of thought and expres- 
sion, by this talented writer. This strong, picturesque, uplifting romance is already assured of being 
one of the most talked-about books of the day. 

JUST PUBLISHED

Cloth. Decorated cover. Price, $1.00 net. Postage 12 cents.

THE CHARMING NEW ENGLAND NOVEL 

CONCERNING POLLY 

By HELEN M. WINSLOW, editor of "The Club Woman." Illus- 
trated by Charles Copeland. l2mo. Cloth. $1.50. 

Not for many a day has such rich New England humor been presented. Miss Winslow at 
once takes her place with the two premier delineators of New England character, Mary Wilkins 
and Sarah Orne Jewett; and in graphic presentation of true country life, independent of eccentricity 
or idealization, she surpasses either, as this book will prove. 

TWENTIETH THOUSAND 

ROCKHAVEN 

By CHARLES C. MUNN, author of "Pocket Island" and "Uncle 
Terry." Illustrated by Frank T. Merrill. Fine laid paper. Qilt top. 
Decorated cover. Price, $1.50. 

"In this story Mr. Munn has added to the qualities he first revealed in 'Pocket Island' and 
later in 'Uncle Terry.' The present story woiks out perhaps a more complete love story than 
either of the others, but the author's strength still remains mostly with his sea-coast characters and 
fishermen. In delineating New England traits and speech Mr. Munn is at his best, and his best 
is wholesome and entertaining." — The Outlook.

THE GROWTH AND MISSION OF 
NA TUREPOETR Y. 



Among carrent phrases, few have received wider 
nse and more frequent distortion than the herald 
cry of Ronssean, " Back to Natare." In its incep- 
tion a watchword of revolt against tyranny and ar- 
tifice, it has inspired the most sincere reforms and 
has clothed the most morbid sensationalism of the 
past centary. Despite occasional perversion, how- 
ever, the nineteenth centnry reinstated Natare as 
an inspiration to the noblest poetry, as an incentive 
to edacational vitality, as an agent to restore and 
interpret life in its elemental sanity. While we 
speak of Natare stady and Natare poetry as evi- 
dences of the advance of this age, we forget that, 
in tmth, we have receded to past ideals and re- 
stated them with the knowledge and broader spirit 
of oar own century. We have yet to surpass the 
Natare revelations of beaaty and worship in the 
primitive literatures. If we have a scientific accu- 
racy, a logical interpretation of Nature's laws, have 
we achieved any purer insight, any loftier imagin- 
ation, than was attained by Moses on the Midian 
hills, by David in the Palestine pastures, or by 
Homer and Mosehas on the shores of the .£gean? 
We have yet to surpass the pastorals of Virgil and 
Lacretias, the glowing visions of Celtic Ossian and 
Persian Omar, or the grand and fervid narratives 
of the Runic bards. 

These primitive poets foand Nature beautifnl 
and friendly ; more than that, she was a guide and 
a protector. They embodied their love and worship 
for her under symbols of their religion ; we do the 
same. One may dispute the accuracy of these early 
poetic fancies ; such criticism fails to nullify their 
poetic insight. They could not understand the 
scientific processes of growth, fermentation, and 
decay, — laws explained by mere children to-day, 
— yet they knew the value of Nature to humanity, 
they recognized her inspiration and worshipped 
her divinity. The facts which thousands of years 
have discovered are of great value, but they do not 
affect the real truth, the vital spirit of these pioneer 
Nature interpreters. For their superstition, we have 
instilled the spirit of research. 

It is a far call from our age to these pastorals of 
classic times; there have been many tangential 
paths, hence the message '' Back to Nature." Con- 
fining oneself to English poetry, as example, one 
notes the survival of early ideals in the pastorals of 
Piers the Plowman, and Chaucer ; then the grad- 
ual transference of interest from Natare to ha-

THE DIAL

inanity, and the era of artificial standards and 
verbose, euphnistic form. Two poets, Spenser and 
Shakespeare, retained their love of Nature and ad- 
herence to her simple, sincere teachings. The 
former confessed to a desire to revive the Vir- 
gilian spirit. The latter painted marvellous tints 
of sunshine and forest shade ; he used Nature as a 
background for his finest scenes. With a magical 
insight he seemed to prophesy our later spirit of 
scientific yet poetic interpretation, when his Jacques 
found 

" ToDgnes in trees, books in the running brooks, 
Sermons in stones, and good in everything." 

Following these poets, who interpreted Nature 
in an age already becoming enslaved to form and 
fashion, there was the era of apathy and decadence, 
both in poetry of nature and of loftier life, from 
the later passing of Shakespeare to the advent of 
Cowper and Wordsworth. For a time. Nature was 
regarded not alone with indifference but even with 
disgust. Dryden, Pope, and their associates, ex- 
tolled the city and deplored the hardships of trips 
into the country. In prose also was voiced this 
game sentiment of repugnance : the hills were irk- 
some, the streams were swollen, the ocean was wild 
and gloomy. With the exception of occasional 
lines in Milton's masterpieces. Nature seemed a 
tabooed theme for poetic usage. 

From such abnormal status there came a re- 
action, gradual and tentative for many decades. 
At first it was in the revival of Nature similes, not 
to celebrate the glories of scenery, but to afford 
more striking epithets for descriptions of town- 
life and simpering heroines of the drawing-room. 
One readily recalls the vacuous phrases, " lithe as 
a willow," " cheeks like a damask rose," and similar 
" millinery adjectives." Nature, as either true illus- 
tration or incentive, was still unseen. In minor 
strains one notes the first revival of simple, true 
appreciation of Nature forms and rural beauty. 
Gay's " Shepherd's Week " contains a few rare in- 
tuitive lines on bird habits and country life. The 
" Pastorals " of Ambrose Phillips are meagrely 
interlined with passages of Nature observation, 
though one still misses the note of comradeship. 
Allan Ramsay was the pioneer poet in this revival 
of sympathy between Nature and man ; " The 
Gentle Shepherd " emanated from an observant 
mind and a sincere love of rural scenes. 

Thomson, by concentration of theme and minute- 
ness of description, stimulated popular taste to a 
new observation of English woods and flowers. 
While his scenery is vivid and often effulgent, 
there is a lack of the emotional warmth noted in 
Ramsay, and soon to be fully vitalized in the 
poetry of Gray, Beattie, and Burns. This spiritual 
awakening found expression in the poetry of Lang- 
home, Burns, Crabbe ; it reached its fruition in 
Cowper, Wordsworth, Bryant, and Whittier. Over 
the tender and significant Nature poems of Cowper, 



will ever linger his epigram, defiant to the artificers- 
of past verse, — 

" God made the country and man made the town." 
Nature had a personal message of healing for this 
poet in the tangled meshes of his life ; he realized 
and poetized her sane, restorative powers. 

Thus had the poets of the middle and later 
eighteenth century portrayed Nature as a sensuous 
delight, a mental inspiration, and a shrine for the 
soul's worship and repose. Wordsworth embodied 
all these attributes. To him. Nature, in wildness 
or repose, inflamed the senses and the imagination, 
incited observation and thought, revealed the true 
meaning of creation and the divine. A type of the 
imaginative dullard of his time was " Peter Bell." 
This apathy he combatted with far more vigor than 
he deplored extreme scientific dissection. Eager to 
bring about harmony between the poet and th» 
scientist, Wordsworth was the pioneer in express- 
ing this ideal unity, now far nearer its consum- 
mation ; " If the time should ever come when what 
is now called science, thus familiarized to man, 
shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh 
and blood, the Poet will lend this divine spirit to 
aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the Being 
thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the 
household of man." Tennyson and Browning, af- 
fected even more than were Wordsworth and Shelley 
by the scientific trend of thought, blended accuracy 
with tenderness, observation with passion. Emer- 
son revealed in American poetry the influence of 
converging science and poetry, often substituting 
the philosopher's query for the poet's fancy. In 
" The Rhodora," however, with dauntless defiance 
to speculation and utilitarian theories, he has pro- 
duced a marvel of poetic charm. 

We apply the term Nature-poet without dis- 
crimination. In fact, after the revival of this in- 
spiration nearly all the Victorian poets of first rank, 
and the American writers in yet greater degree, 
used Nature freely in their "poet's cloth of gold." 
Tennyson found her beauteous changes a never- 
failing illustration for his lyrics and dramas of life. 
" In Memoriam " is tinctured by scenic stanzas, 
analogies or accompaniment to human mood. Swin- 
burne and Morris, with less skill and diversity, have 
thus used Nature as illustration. Browning, in the 
major part of his poetry, does not commingle in 
loving relations man and the external world, either 
in its glory or its peace. There are exceptional 
passages, as the delicate song of the Msyne in 
" Paracelsus." From Nature, as a rule, he gains 
solitary intellectual incentive. In " Pippa Passes " 
and " Saul," however, the poet interprets human 
responsibility and sanity through the allegorical 
and descriptive messages of Nature. 

Few poets have had deeper fervor for solitary Na- 
ture, both broad and restricted, than Landor. Like 
Keats, a devotee of classicism, he peopled woods 
and hills with messengers of Phcebus and Bacchus,

eyen as the Engltsh nightingale is to Keats » 
"lightwinged dryad of the trees." Oeeasionally 
in lAudor's poems one meets a Ijrie, blending, in 
happy simile, Natare and heart-love : 

" From Ton. lantlie, little tronbles pav 
Like little ripples down a sonny river ; 
Yoar pleasures spring like daisies in the graaa. 
Cat down, and np again as blithe as ever." 

The ancients gave Natare animate shapes, yet 
seldom hnman ; they made her sympathetic with 
man. often creative for him. Bat it remained for 
the nineteenth centary to endow Natnre with a goal, 
to apostrophize her as the highest conception of 
Life, Love, and Truth. Wordsworth infused both 
a mentality and a spirituality into the object of his 
worshipful companionship. Coleridge embodying 
his philosophy in his Nature poetry made the world 
the transcendental image of ourselves : 

" Ah ! from the sonl itself mast issne fortli 
A light, a glory, a fair laminoas clond 
Enveloping the Earth." 

Shelley's poetry yet more personifies the elements 
with the spirit of life and love. His " Skylark " 
is. a " blithe spirit," his " West Wind " a " spirit 
fierce, — impetuous one." Love, embodiment of 
Natare and humanity, the ultimate sublime crea- 
tion, utters the magical finale of " Prometheus Un- 
bound," — 

" And folds over the world its healing vings." 

While for purposes of classification one may 
divide the modern poet«, in their treatment of Na- 
tare, into three classes — those who worked by illas- 
tratioD, by incentive, and by interpretation, — such 
distinctions are far from absolute. Tennyson and 
Browning, Longfellow and Lowell, are in the main 
types of illustrative poets ; Byron, Scott, and Lan- 
dor, poets of mental incentive or inspiration ; 
Wordsworth, Shelley, Bryant, Emerson, and Whit- 
tier are interpreters of human and divine laws 
through Natnre communion. There are, however, 
occasional poems by many of the modern exponents 
of this age of speculation, suggesting queries and 
yearning for their solution in Nature's laws. In 
Tennyson's later work are many such hints ; for 
he was the most perfect creation of his age. When 
he plucks his " Flower from the Crannied Wall," 
his cry is, 

" Bnt if I oonld nnderstaad 
What jon are, root and all, and all i> all, 
I shotild know what God and maa ia." 

The current poets have interwoven Natnre in 
varied ways, — especially as allurement to wearied 
city -pent souls, and as antidote to devitalizing com- 
mercialism and greed. Nature vistas, in vigor- 
oas and delicate outlines, are scattered throughout 
the poetry of Robert Buchanan. George Meredith, 
William Henley, and Alfred Austin. They give 
sensuous charm to the dramas of Stephen Phillips, 
and to the tense and virile odes of Kipling. Wil- 
liam Watson, an avowed pupil of Wordsworth, has 



proclaimed allegiance in deep sympathetic Natare 
worship. 

In American poetry there are yet more distinct 
stages of development and messages of joyanee 
and reverence in Natare communion. It is axiom- 
atic to recall the early prose, and the so-called 
poems, descriptive of the cold wild hills and foreata 
that seemed ''daunting terrible" to the colonists in 
their primal search for shelter and harvest. With 
the conquest of the soil and relaxation of the Pur- 
itan revulsion against all objects of taste and joy, 
came an awakening of the observant and descrip- 
tive faculties, — reflected in the pioneer Natare 
verses of Philip Freneau and Richard Alsop. 
After a series of crude yet sincere efforts at picto- 
rial vision, among sach forgotten poets as Percival 
and Wilde, wherein awe is replaced by comradeship, 
Bryant, in 1817, wrote *' 'Tbanatoptsis " and de- 
clared himself oar first true Natare poet. Like 
Wordsworth, he combined illustrative portrayal 
with fervent incentive and broad interpretation. 
Emerson and Whittier also revealed this reflective 
and interpretative attitude. If the former often ac- 
centuated the philosophic strain, he never lost the 
poet's charm. Whittier must ever suggest the simple 
and heartfelt bucolics of Blake and Burns. Less 
speculative but more trustful than his associates, he 
has poetized Nature in graphic and varied forms. 
Lowell, like Tennyson, fonnd incentive to keen im- 
aginative and emotional pictures in woodland walk, 
brilliant flowers, or dashing ocean-spray. Long- 
fellow is especially the American poet of the sea 
and shore, and in these memories are fonnd some 
of his most perfect work. With a note of tme 
revelatory inspiration, he wrote, 

" The heart of the great nniw 
Sends a thrilling polae through me." 

Bayard Taylor is yet to receive due recognition as 
a poet. To him Nature gave rich fancies and strong 
interpretations of life and divine laws. The early 
" Home Pastorals," the later sensuous pictures of 
the Orient, reveal the poet's insight and joyous 
comradeship with widely-scattered Nature forms. 
In the rollicking music of " Wind and Sea," as song 
to-day, do we not often forget the poetic beauty ? 
Buoyancy and grace coalesce in his poems. In 
occasional revulsion at Whitman's baldness and 
scientific freedom, we may overlook two odes an- 
eqaalled in tenderness and Natare interpretation 
— the nocturne of the mocking-bird and the per- 
fume of the lilac. 

Southern skies and color most ever lure the poet's 
senses. America has claim to no poet more deeply 
infused with Natare communion than was Lanier. 
He possessed even more than comradeship. His 
soul responded to personal affinity in the marshes, 
the robin, and the " Friendly, sisterly, sweet-heart 
leaves." 

In later poetry, of whatever locality, there are 
few distinctive Nature versifiers. The exclusive- 



274 



THE DIAL 



(Nov. 1, 



ness of theme has given place to broader suggestions 
of the conaplex incentives of the age. Wordsworth 
and Bryant are still the pervasive influences in 
Nature poetry. They were deeply imbued with the 
mission of such authorship, — to educate the senses, 
incite the imagination and thought, and inspire the 
80ul to worshipful interpretation of higher truths. 
Nature will reveal her lessons only to the responsive 

Boal. 

" Yea, what were mighty Nature's self ? 
Her features could they win us, 
Unhelped by the poetic voice 
That hourly speaks within us ? " 

The mission and the distinctive message of Nature 
poetry have been assimilated in many other themes 
of current verse. She utters her reproach, she 
offers her benison, to a restless civilization. The 
exquisite lyrics of Mr. Aldrich, the symphonic 
hymnal stanzas of Mr. Stoddard, the lyric pictures 
by Richard Burton and Dr. Van Dyke, Miss Reeve 
and Miss Guiney, the flower-songs of Mrs. Moulton 
and Mrs. Deland, the bucolics of James Whitcomb 
Riley, — such are indicative of the variety and ef- 
fulgence of American Nature-lore. In the strange 
focalized genius of Emily Dickinson are brilliant 
descriptive flashes, as in " The Blue Jay ": 

" No brigadier throughout the year 
So civic as the jay. 
A neighbor and a warrior too. 
With shrill felicity." 

Among our younger American poets, nearly all 
of whom have written Nature verse of beauty, are 
three with significant motives. The sonnets of Mr. 
Lloyd Mifflin are unique and revelatory of the 
artist-student of woods and shore. If the metrical 
form is occasionally difficult to maintain with ease, 
the mind-image is always lucid and stimulative. 
Mr. Scollard is a poet of rare melodies. His excess 
of imagery seldom obscures the real simplicity and 
fervor of thought. " The Walk " which leads him 
to " The Hills of Song," and more recently " The 
Lure of the Woodland," have traces of floridity, 
but are matchless in music and joyance. From our 
fretting, rushing surface-impressions. Nature can 
lure us by the " magicry " and harmony portrayed 
by this poet. For the tabulated facts of Nature, 
her poetry supplies loving observation and recogni- 
tion of the vital truths, " the verities of life." Na- 
ture to such a poet is not alone a picture but a 
loving comrade. To give counterpoise to the scien- 
tific analysis of the day, the poet trains imagination 
and soul for Nature-communion. Mr. Cheney, one 
of our lyrists of elemental glories and concrete 
beauties, has well embodied the poet's mission as 
interpreter of Nature : 

" For him the June days never go, 
For him the roses ever blow, 
And bleakest hours that be 
Are loud with melody ; 
He looks, his eye in darkness sightful is ; 
He leans, his ear can hear the silences."

A BOSWJELL. FOR DUMAS.* 



"Posterity for me begins at the frontier," said 
Dumas. And it is only during the last quarter- 
century — since the death of their writer — that 
the imaginative pages of " Monte Cristo " and 
" Les Trois Mousquetaires " have made Amer- 
ica no inconsiderable part of that frontier. It 
has recently been pointed out that it is chiefly to 
Mr. Andrew Lang and Robert Louis Stevenson 
that the literary rehabilitation of Dumas with 
the English-speaking public is to be credited ; 
the former having assured us that the adven- 
tures of the three musketeers belonged to a legi- 
timate sphere of French literature, while the 
latter voiced his admiration of the unstrained 
and wholesome morality of his " Vicomte de 
Bragelonne." 

In his interesting narrative of the life and 
works of Dumas, Mr. Arthur F. Davidson, a 
critical English student, has made good use of 
the voluminous Dumas literature that pre- 
ceded him. The various French works con- 
cerning Dumas have all confined themselves to 
some particular side of his talent or some par- 
ticular period of his life. Hence, the present 
volume is, from a biographical and literary 
standpoint, the first comprehensive and con- 
tinuous work, and fitly commemorates the cen- 
tenary of Dumas's birth — July 24, 1902. For 
some time the belief was current that Dumas 
was born in 1803. Says the present biogra- 
pher : 

" By a singular inadvertence — so persistent is error 
— this was the date which originally appeared on the 
monument in the Place Malesherbes, which has since 
been corrected. It is reasonable to attribute the origin 
of this mistake to the ambiguity of the Republican Cal- 
endar. ' On the fifth day of Thermidor in the year X of 
the French Republic ' — so runs the ar.le de naissance of 
Dumas; and only on the supposition that the first year 
of the Republic began on September 22, 1793, would 
X be 1803. But, in fact, the first year was considered 
to end, not to begin, on September 22, 1793, so that X 
would be 1802." 

The first pronounced literary influence ex- 
perienced by Dumas came from a meeting 
with Adolph de Leuven, afterwards a prolific 
writer of vaudevilles and comic operas. An- 
other event bearing upon his career was a per- 
formance of tragedy called " Hamlet," by an au- 
thor named Ducis. So the pla y-bill announced.

To Dumas the word " tragedy " saggested Cor- 
neille and Racine. He knew nothing of " Ham- 
let," nor of Dacis; still less that this was only 
an adaption from Shakespeare in which the 
French playwright sought to smooth over the 
crndities of the original by certain doctorings 
in the approved " classic " style. 

" The demon of poetry was now awakened in 
me, and would give me no rest," said Dumas. 
Soon after, through a happy chance, he was 
introduced to that happy coterie of privileged 
beings who made the plays and the laws of 
the Theatre Franc^ais. 

As this event marked a starting-point in his 
remarkable career, it may not be amiss to lay 
aside for the moment Mr. Davidson's biogra- 
phy and glance at the conditions then existing. 
The aberrations of the French dramatists arose 
principally from an egregious misconception of 
Shakespeare, whom they ambitiously attempted 
to imitate and rival. His name, and those 
of Schiller and Goethe, were perpetually on 
their lips ; and yet the only development they 
aimed at was that of sensual propensities, — 
although these are the lowest in the scale of 
themes for dramatic treatment, according to 
those great masters themselves. The old for- 
mal classic drama had fallen into decay and 
disrepute ; a new order of things was demanded 
by the innovating spirit of the time?. Great 
models of other nations, indistinctly under- 
stood, seemed to form standards whereon their 
compositions might be moulded. Unsuited to 
French style and sentiment, the endeavor to 
imitate them led to productions of the most ano- 
malous character, wherein the stateliness of 
Shakespeare, the mysticism of the German, the 
impetuous frivolity and diseased imagination 
of France, were mingled in a heterogeneous 
compound. Wherever the influence of Shake- 
speare is felt it must be ultimately beneficial. 
Schiller's " Wallenstein " and Goethe's " Tor- 
quato Tasso " sank into inferiority when com- 
pared with Shakespeare. When the French 
public began to manifest the desire for a new 
dramatic form — for a drama more in unison 
with and expressive of the spirit of the times 
— Delavigne wrote his " Vepres Siciliennes." 
It appeared in 1824 (when Dumas was twenty- 
two years of age), and the sentiments of liberty 
that abounded in it endeared it for a while to 
a fastidious public. It was the forerunner of a 
new school in French dramatic art. 

" La Chasse et I'Amour," a vaudeville in the 
Scribe fashion, marked Dumas's debut as a 
dramatist. The piece was produced at once, — 



illustrating, as Dumas in a Pickwickian way 
observes, "the mutability of human judgment." 
Other light works were produced in quick suc- 
cession. In 1827 a company of English actors, 
chief among whom was Charles Kemble, visited 
Paris with a Shakespearian repertoire. " From 
this hour, as never before, I had an idea what 
the theatre really was," says Dumas. " It was 
the first time I had seen on the stage real pas- 
sions animating men and women of flesh and 
blood." 

"Henry III.," — described as a faithful 
picture of the period intended to be repre- 
sented, — was a notable success. It was appre- 
ciated the more for the reason that hitherto 
Dumas had been notorious for the freedom 
with which he poached in German preserves ; 
while the talent displayed in dressing up his 
spoils, combined with his undoubted originality, 
had silenced his critics. " Christine " and 
"Antony" followed "Henry III." These 
preceded their author's short career of political 
life, summing up which his biographer says : 

" It is easv enoagh to criticise him from the vantage- 
groond of secure indifference; we do better to remem- 
ber bow hard it was in those ' incandescent ' dajs to 
avoid entanglements (witness, for example, all the 
ridiculoas tnrmoil raised in 1833 about the interesting 
condition of the Dncbesse de Berry), and to admit that 
if Dumas sometimes made a fool of himself he did so 
in a numerous and not undistinguished company." 

Page after page is devoted by Mr. Davidson 
to the other theatrical works of Dumas. We 
are told how his "Napoleon Bonaparte" was 
written ; we are given descriptions and critical 
comments on " Antony," " Richard Darling- 
ton," " La Tour de Nesle," Catherine Howard," 
" Don Juan de Marana," etc., on down through 
the list. Then follow entertaining chapters of 
anecdote and reminiscence. As he approached 
middle age, the alert dramatist noticed with 
regret two tendencies of the times : the decline 
of supper parties as an institution, and the 
growing habit of smoking. He regarded nico- 
tine as a stupefying drug, — the enemy of 
esprit. At repartee, Dumas was always able 
to hold his own. At the Fran^ais one evening, 
during the performance of a play by Soumet, 
a spectator was observed to be slumbering. 
" Look, ' said Dumas to the author of the play, 
who was sitting near him, "you see the effect 
produced by your tragedy I " But next evening, 
at the same theatre, it happened that the play 
was one of Dumas's own, and it happened that 
a gentleman in the stalls was overpowered with 
sleep. Soumet, being present, noticed this ; 
and with infinite satisfaction, tapping Dumas

on the shoulder, he said : " Please notice, my 
dear Dumas, that your plays can send people 
to sleep as well as mine." " Not at all," was 
the ready reply ; " that 's our friend of yester- 
day ; he has not woke up yet ! " 

Mr. Davidson points out that between Scott 
and Dumas there are resemblances which al- 
ways strike the attention. Both, as boys, were 
what is scholastically called " idle "; both be- 
gan life as apprentices to the legal profession ; 
each essayed a form of literature different 
from that in which he eventually found his 
widest popularity. Scott began with poetry, 
Dumas with drama ; but the chief title to fame 
for both was to be the historical novel. In 
each case German romanticism was a powerful 
influence ; and by a curious coincidence both 
Scott and Dumas in early years exercised them- 
selves in a translation of the same work — 
Burger's ballad of " Lenore." Both authors, 
it may be added, made much money by their 
writings ; the one built his Abbotsford, the 
other his Monte Cristo, — and both fell into 
financial difficulties. " The qualities of Scott," 
said Dumas, " are not dramatic qualities. Ad- 
mirable in the portrayal of manners, charac- 
ter, and costume, he is unable to depict pas- 
sions. ' Kenilworth ' is the only roman pas- 
sions that be wrote, and it is the only one that 
has attained great success in stage form. . . . 
My conviction was that France would be best 
suited by an equal fidelity in regard to man- 
ners and characters, combined with a more 
lively dialogue and more real passions." After 
reading the " Waverley Novels," he cherished 
the idea of popularizing French history. 

In Victor Hugo, France beheld the double 
character of genius : the light-hearted poet and 
the dismal humanitarian ; the lover of beauty 
for the sake of beauty, and the conscious ad- 
mirer — not to say advocate — of ugliness, of 
crime, of monsters. Balzac was survived by a 
feeble school of imitators, and France was sub- 
jected to a tainted course of licentious literature 
— in which scandalous stories were covered 
over by a certain elegant varnish by describing 
the scenes as taking place in the drawing-rooms 
and boudoirs of high life. Michelet was looked 
upon as a professional historian. Merimee 
was too delicate for the general public, though 
his gems of art were prized by the connois- 
seurs. Such was the condition of things when 
Dumas conceived the idea of writing novels of 
historical significance, as Scott had done across 
the channel. " Le Chevalier d'Harmental " was 
followed by " Une Fille de Regent," " La 



Beine Margot," " Le Chevalier de Maison 
Rouge," "Joseph Balsamo," and so on. Says 
Mr. Davidson : 

" Human nature, as Plato long ago observed, has 
been coined in very small pieces ; and the sorting of 
these, to form a just estimate of character, involved so 
much balancing and counterbalancing that it ends in 
being perplexing without being any the more infallible. 
For Dumas it has to be said that whenever he touches 
history — in novels, plays, or studies — he has the true 
historical instinct; without either faculty or inclination 
for the drudgery of analysis he somehow arrives at a 
synthesis quite as convincing as any that can be reached 
by the most minute methods." 

" The Three Musketeers," — the loyal com- 
radeship of these seventeenth-century gallants, 
their reckless fighting, their impetuous love- 
making, which typified to the French public 
certain characteristics identified with France 
in her greatest days, — jumped into instant 
popularity. Speaking of " The Count of Monte 
Cristo," written in collaboration with Maquet 
and possibly Fiorentino, Blaze de Bury says : 

" Dumas in a way collaborated with everyone. . . . 
From an anecdote he made a story, from a story he 
made a romance, from a romance he made a drama; 
and he never let an idea go until he had extracted from 
it everything that it could yield him. Admit, as the 
critics will have it, his collaboration, plagiarism, imita- 
tion: he possessed himself what no one could give him; 
and this we know because we have seen what his assist- 
ants did when they were working on their own account 
and separately from him." 

The present biographer has gone carefully 
through the long list of Dumas's writings, de- 
scribing plots and analyzing motives. It would 
be superfluous to follow him minutely through 
the list ; suffice it to say that the work is that 
of a scholar, and one who has breathed the at- 
mosphere of Dumas for many years. As the 
vogue of the historical novel began and ended, 
so far as France is concerned, with the author 
of " Les Trois Mousquetaires," his biographer 
is justified in adding that the influence of Dumas 
has probably been the greatest in the sphere of 
the drama. Sardou considered him the best 
all-round homme de theatre of his century. 
" Never," wrote a friend, "were good humor, 
cordiality, and sympathy more plainly stamped 
on any face than on that of Dumas." 

A vagrant by nature, Dumas was always on 
the move, and his movements were as swift as 
his repartee. It is said that when he left 
Pjiris for the last time, he brought with him 
all his worldly wealth in the shape of a single 
gold-piece, which he solemnly deposited on the 
mantel-piece of his room at Puys. One day, 
toward the close of his eventful career, his eye 
wandered to this coin, which had remained un-

have people accused me of being a prodigal? I 
have preserved it and possess it still; look, there

5, 1870, the end came in an apoplectic seizure.

The "ViBGrsxA.*' Pox.* 



When the edition of Poe, prepared under 
the editorship of Mr. Stedman and Professor 
Woodberry, was published about ten years ago, 
it seemed as if editorial and critical skill had 
exhausted the possibilities of the case, and that 
the works of the author were at last brought 
together in a form that would remain definitive. 
But we are compelled to admit, after a care- 
ful examination, that the existence of the new 
■" Virginia " edition, edited by Professor James 
A. Harrison, is fully justified by the new matter 
which it offers, as well as by its corrections in 
the text of the matter already familiar. While 
we cannot say that it supersedes the earlier edi- 
tion — nothing could well supersede the critical 
and biographical work of the former editors — 
it does provide a supplement to that edition 
which students of Poe will henceforth find in- 
<[i8pensable. 

A precis of the new edition, based upon the 
editor's statement, will make clear the reasons 
for the judgment above expressed. Quoting 
Foe's own words, '^ I am naturally anxious that 
what I have written should circulate as I wrote 
H, if it circulate at all," the editor tells us that 
he became convinced almost from the start of 
the necessity of extracting " a new and abao- 
lately authentic text from the magazines, per- 
iodicals, and books of tales and poems which 
Poe himself had edited or to which he had 
contributed." In the application of this pro- 
-oednre each one of the tales and poems has 
been made the snbject of a special study of its 
various " states," with the result that we have 
in most instances a very different text from that 
published by Griswold. In two or three cases 
only, the Griswold version has been reproduced 
for the simple reason that the original publi- 
cation was absolutely not to be found. The

foundations of the new edition are supplied bj 
Poe's own copy of the " Broadway Journal " 
marked by himself, his own copy of " The Raven 
and Other Poems " (1845), with the poet's mar- 
ginal corrections (amounting, in the case of 
" The Raven " alone, to no l^s than thirty- 
seven changes), his own copy of the " Tales " 
(1845) with similar corrections, his own copy 
of "Eureka," also annotated by the author, and 
the original files of the " Southern Literary 
Messenger" and other periodicals to which 
Foe contributed from time to time. 

The work thus presented as Poe wished it 
to be read is arranged in strictly chronological 
order, making it possible to study the evolution 
of his style, and his growth from the crudity 
of his earlier writings to the almost absolute 
perfection of his best later work. In dealing 
with the " Literati " papers, Griswold's sub- 
stitution of his own work for that of Foe in no 
less than five cases is exposed. The " Margin- 
alia " now includes some forty pages of matter 
that Griswold suppressed, and the papers on 
autography and secret writing are now for the 
first time reprinted in full. There are variooB 
appendices (for Mr. Harrison has aimed to give 
us a Foe encyclopsedia rather than a mere new 
edition), among which we notice an examin- 
ation of the Poe-Chivers controversy which 
makes it clear that Chivers was the plagiarist, 
several contemporary reviews of Poe, some new 
matter found among the Griswold manuscripts, 
and a complete bibliography of all of Poe'i 
known writings. Finally, we have all of Poe's 
correspondence that the editors could find, in- 
cluding many letters to the poet as well as 
those written by him. Something like two- 
thirds of the contents of this volume of corres- 
pondence consists of matter which is new even 
to the special students of the poet. 
- This statement of the general results ac- 
complished by the painstaking industry of the 
editor must now be supplemented by an account 
of the consecutive volumes of the new edition. 
The first of the seventeen volumes is occupied 
with a biography of the most searching and 
painstaking sort. The appendix to this volume 
gives us the autobiographical memorandum 
prepared for Griswold, Griswold's famous (or 
infamous) " Lndwig " article on the death of 
the poet, and five additional articles and 
essays by Lowell, Willis, and others. Next in 
order come five volumes of the tales. This 
section has for an introduction the eloquent 
essay of Mr. H. W. Mabie on " Poe's Place 
in Literature," prepared as an address at the

University of Virginia upon the occasion of 
the Poe celebration three years ago. Here, 
as elsewhere throughout the edition, the vari- 
ants of the different printed texts are minutely 
recorded in a body of notes. The single vol- 
ume of the poems has an elaborate critical in- 
troduction by Professor Charles W. Kent, of 
which the most striking feature is a parallel 
drawn between Poe and Chopin, a parallel 
that grows upon the reader the more he thinks 
of it. The appendix to this volume includes 
several poems that have been attributed to 
Poe, and reduces to an absurdity the charge 
of plagiarism made in behalf of Chivers. 

The tales and poems are followed by six 
volumes of literary criticism, of which nearly 
four consist of matter now for the first time re- 
printed. This fact alone would furnish ample 
justification for the new edition, were it in any 
way needed. Some of the notices may seem 
almost as unimportant as the forgotten books 
that they embalm, but there can be no serious 
question of the importance of making accessi- 
ble the entire output of our first professional 
critic of high rank. The fourteenth volume con- 
tains essays and miscellaneous writings, about 
one-fourth of the matter being new. Here we 
find in full the articles on secret writing, also 
"The Philosophy of Composition," "The Ra- 
tionale of Verse," and "The Poetic Principle." 
The fifteenth volume gives us "The Literati of 
New York City " and the first reprint of the 
" Autography " papers, facsimiles and all. The 
editing of the " Literati" has had the singular 
result of proving that five of the papers hitherto 
included in editions of Poe were not written by 
Poe at all, but were substituted by Griswold for 
Poe's original articles. This is a particularly 
interesting revelation, because in the case of 
Thomas Dunn English it shows that much of the 
malice of the attack was Griswold's. A more 
cowardly and contemptible act is probably not 
to be found in all the annals of editing. Mr. 
Harrison has now restored Poe's articles to 
their proper places, and printed Griswold's per- 
versions in an appendix. The sixteenth volume 
gives us the fifteen papers called "Marginalia," 
exactly reprinted from the magazines in which 
they appeared. Then comes the "Eureka " in 
full, with the notes made by the author in his 
own copy, and which he intended to embody in 
a second edition. This volume closes with a Poe 
bibliography, followed by a general index to 
the fifteen volumes of the works. Last of all, 
we have in the seventeenth volume the Poe cor- 
respondence, which represents one of the chief 



services done for us by Mr. Harrison. Although 
many of Poe's letters have found a place in his 
various biographies, it yet remains true that 
many others are now for the first time printed, 
and that the letters have never before been col- 
lected into a volume of their own. The value of 
this volume is greatly enhanced by its inclusion 
in many cases of both sides of the correspond- 
ence, and by the addition of many letters writ- 
ten about Poe by his friends and others. It 
should be said in closing this account, that each 
volume of the seventeen has a frontispiece illus- 
tration, and that the entire set is presented in 
a handy form that makes its use a pleasure,^ 
whether for consultation or continuous reading.

Development and Evolution.* 



A fractious critic of Professor J. M. Bald- 
win's latest work, " Development and Evolu- 
tion," might head his review " The Circular 
Reaction," borrowing a favorite term of the 
author's. The patient reader finds himself 
again and again confronted by the same argu- 
ments and the same definitions, and in chapter 
viii. the author actually quotes portions " from 
an earlier page " of the same work, equivalent 
when added together to about six pages ! Fur- 
thermore, we are favored with long extracts 
from the writings of several authors, express- 
ing again the views set forth in the book. In 
his preface, Professor Baldwin explains and 
defends this procedure at some length, and 
says, what is certainly true, that repetition has 
its pedagogical justification. 

Putting aside this peculiarity of the work, 
it may be said at once that there is much in it 
to interest any intelligent reader. No attempt 
is made to adopt a " popular " style of writing, 
or to enliven the pages with poor jokes ; but 
the facts and arguments are clearly put for- 
ward in language not too technical to be un- 
derstood. Also, as might be expected from 
Professor Baldwin, the book represents orig- 
inal thought of a high order, and not a rehash 
of other people's notions. In view of the large 
amount of second-rate scientific literature in- 
tended for general reading, it is worth while to 
point out these distinctions. 

The central idea of the book is that of " Or-

ganic Selection," whereby those individuals 
(plants, animals, or men) survive which ac- 
commodate themselves to their environment. 
In the simplest form of Natural Selection, cer- 
tain individuals survive because best fitted for 
their surroundings ; while others, possessing 
inherent weaknesses or defects, die or fail to 
leave offspring. For example, a bird or a rep- 
tile or an insect may survive because its color 
is such as to make it inconspicuous. Its nat- 
ural enemies, ever on the lookout for food, 
fail to detect its presence, while they detect 
and devour individuals less fortunately colored. 
Suppose, however, that the creature has the 
power of changing its color to suit its sur- 
roandings, as has the chameleon. It escapes 
jast as well as if it had originally been of the 
necessary color. Suppose, again, that it has no 
chameleon-like power, but has intelligence, so 
that, being green, it hides amongst green leaves ; 
or being brown, amongst the rocks. Again it 
escapes destruction. Suppose that, instead of 
hiding, it learns to fight, and defeats its ene- 
mies. The result is again the same. In short, 
many creatures survive through a process of 
accommodation to their surroundings, — and 
this is " Organic Selection." 

It has been difficult for evolutionists to ac- 
count for the origin of instinct or physical pe- 
caliarities which, in a slightly developed form, 
would not be of any apparent value. How can 
natural selection preserve that which is merely 
prophetic of a coming utility ? The explana- 
tion lies partly in the fact that such characters 
may be correlated with others which are useful 
at the time, but also very largely in " Organic 
Selection," which preserves individuals capable 
of adaptive modifications. To take a simple 
instance, the native intelligence of man, under 
the conditions of civilized society, would by 
no means secure survival. Even a genius, if 
brought up in isolation and totally uneducated, 
would be a very poor sort of human being. 
Man, however, has immense powers of adapta- 
tion, and is able to supplement his original 
endowment by a process of learning which gives 
him command of the greater part of the earth. 
However, this acquired learning, like every 
other acquired character, apparently cannot be 
inherited, and the new-born child has to learn 
as did his parents. It has been suggested that 
this fact would put a stop to progress, because 
the means of survival would not be transmitted. 
This, however, is not at all the case, for in every 
instance the acquired characters are built upon 
congenital ones. The foundations, as it were. 



are transmitted ; and the best strnctnres are 
those built on solid foundations. Who has not 
seen acquired characters collapse because of 
the lack of hereditary power ? and who has not 
seen the effects of an evil inheritance ? Hence, 
so far from modification being an impediment 
to progress through selection, it is the very 
thing which renders such progress possible, 
because it gives value to that which would 
otherwise be valueless. It is the parable of the 
talents over again : only those who put what 
they have to good use, whereby it is increased, 
are judged fit. 

It will be apparent, also, that the congenital 
acquirements, which in adult life are over- 
shadowed by those acquired, must be of extreme 
importance at an early and critical stage. A 
slight tendency or ability, at the proper mo- 
ment, may be worth as much as the highest 
powers later on. It is like the small capital 
with which many a merchant begins business : 
a trifling thing in itself, but how significant 
when considered in relation to subsequent 
events I 

Professor Baldwin certainly does a service 
in calling attention to these things, and at the 
same time to the immense importance of mind 
in the evolution of higher types. He shows 
how the power to learn is in many cases better 
than the ability, through instinct, to do as was 
done before. Suppose that we coxdd inherit 
the thoughts and customs of our ancestors, in 
a biological as well as in a social sense ; what 
would be the result ? The people of America, 
for one thing, would still be firm believers in 
monarchy and slavery ; they would still believe 
the world to be flat, and the sun to go around 
the earth. It is well, indeed, that every gen- 
eration has to learn afresh. Yet, with all this, 
each generation receives abundantly from its 
predecessors of the fruits of learning. Through 
books and speech we have the social transmis- 
sion of that which cannot be inherited. Note, 
however, this distinction : we choose what we 
will receive from the past ; the lower types, 
governed by instinct, have to take what comes, 
without choice. Thus, through the power of 
the mind, progress becomes increasingly rapid, 
all sorts of conditions being successfully met. 

It does not seem to the present writer that 
" Organic Selection " is quite a happy term, or 
that it should be contrasted with " Natural 
Selection." Ail these forms of selection are 
included in the Natural Selection of Darwin, 
though the emphasis may have been placed on 
one special type. I should prefer, then, to use 



280 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



the term Natural Selection in a very broad 
sense, and to call the restricted "Natural 
Selection" of Professor Baldwin " Direct Se- 
lection," while Organic Selection might be 
known as " Indirect Selection." 

There are so many interesting ideas in the 
book that any limited review must fail to do it 
justice. The " Theory of Genetic Modes " is 
worth a special article, and cannot be well dis- 
cussed in a few lines. The chapter on " Se- 
lective Thinking " is an important one. It is 
shown that intelligent attention can only be 
given to ideas or facts which can in some way 
be connected with our platform of thought of 
the time being. Thus, the adult rejects ab- 
surdities which do not seem at all incongruous 
to the child. The evolution of thought in the 
life of the individual is thus comparable to the 
«volution of a series of types : at the beginning, 
several alternatives may be possible, but the 
highly-developed type has to follow along the 
path it has chosen, with no great deviation 
therefrom. Hence it may be that the music of 
the spheres is inaudible to us, and a little child 
may understand things which are hidden from 
the adult. And after all, the great secret of 
human superiority lies in the fact that we begin 
life as children, with the power to choose be- 
tween good and evil. We have thus taken upon 
ourselves the functions of the Creator.

The "Woodbridgb Philosopheb.* 

The appearance of a complete edition of 
Edward FitzGerald's writings is gratifying 
proof of increasing appreciation of that rare 
genius. It is a question whether the modest 
recluse himself would have been more amused 
or outraged at the intimation that within 
twenty years of his death he should be ad- 
vanced to the dignity of a " Variorum and 
Definitive Edition " in seven sumptuous vol- 
umes in Japan vellum. For, as Fanny Kemble 
said of him, he "took more pains to avoid fame 
than others do to seek it." 

With most of us, " when the veil from the 
eyes is lifted, the seer's head is gray." In 
FitzGerald's case, the clearer vision, or at least 
the philosophic calm, was his from the cradle. 
While friends and contemporaries turned each

to the conquest of the world in his own way, 
Old Fitz, conscious though he must have been 
of not inferior powers, retired to view the strife 
from an obscure corner of Suffolk, whence the 
glittering vanities of the world seldom lured 
him forth. "Travelling, you know, is a van- 
ity," he declares, with Emerson and Horace ; 
" the soul remains the same." Even near-by 
London he visited only at long intervals ; for 
the people there, he said, were " all clever, com- 
posed, satirical, selfish, and well-dressed. One 
finds but few serious men in London. I mean 
serious even in fun, with a true purpose and 
character, whatsoever it may be. London melts 
away all individuality into a common lump of 
cleverness. . . . The dulness of country life 
is better than the impudence of Londoners." 
Fishermen and farmers he enjoyed, and com- 
munion with his books he found infinitely 
better than idle talk. Compliments were in- 
tolerable to him, and even thanks for gifts he 
thought were better withheld. 

So feminine a sensibility is rarely found 
united with so masculine an intelligence. The 
former, however, is perhaps the more strongly 
marked. " Taste," he was fond of saying, " ia 
the feminine of genius"; and to taste he laid 
some modest claim, but none whatever to gen- 
ius. A humorous sense of the ironies and per- 
versities of this life, of the tendency of all 
things to pass over into their opposites, is man- 
ifest on every page of his letters. His virtues 
had more power to put him to shame than his 
frailties. With the Concord sage, he stood in 
considerable awe of his good qualities. Like 
old Donne he held that " he who knows his 
virtue's name and place, hath none." To 
Tennyson, poor and as yet unknown to fame, 
he writes : 

" I have heard you sometimes say that you were 
bound by the want of such and such a sum, and I tow 
to the Lord that I could not have a greater pleasure 
than transferring it to you on such occasions ; I should 
not dare to say such a thing to a small man, but you are 
not a small man assuredly, and even if you do not make 
use of my o£Fer, you will not be offended, but put it to 
the right account. It is very difficult to persuade peo- 
ple in this world that one can part with a bank-note 
without a pang. It is one of the most simple things I 
hare ever done to talk thus to you, I believe ; but here 
is an end, and be charitable to me." 

To his friends no one could be more loyal. 
He never knew when to cast off an old acquaint- 
ance — or article of dress. The tall hat that he 
wore tilted on the back of his head, and seldom 
removed in the daytime, except when he wanted 
a red handkerchief from its interior, was bat- 
tered and shabby. H is shirt-front, over which

fell a carelessly tied black silk scarf, was not 
too ostentatiously suggestive of the ironing- 
board. His impatience of sham finds manifold 
forms of expression. Leaves and whole sec- 
tions be ruthlessly tore out of his books when 
he thought them mere padding. His library 
was made up chiefly of fragments of authors. 
Only in the case of Shakespeare and a few others 
would he tolerate a writer's opera omnia. And 
yet he so cheerfully endured the dreary length 
of "Clarissa," and the long-windedness of his 
favorite Crabbe, that we find him reading the 
former for the fifth time twenty years before 
his death, and the latter was for decades his 
vade mecum. His letters abound in references 
to what Carlyle called his " innocent far-niente 
life." To Frederic Tennyson he writes : 

"1 live on in a Tery seedy way, reading occasionally 
in books which every one else has gone through at school: 
and what I do read is just in the same way as ladies 
work : to pass the time away. For little remains in my 
head. I dare say you think it very absurd that an idle 
man like me should poke about here in the country, 
when I might be in London seeing my friends: but 
snch is the humour of the beast . . . for all which idle 
«ase I think I must be damned. But idleness is a test 
of virtue. The greater the idleness the greater the 
merit (in being virtuous)." 

And when at rare intervals he so far forsook his 
*' idle ease " as to appear, with modest anony- 
mity, in print, he immediately felt somewhat 
ashamed, as be said, of having allowed his lei- 
sure to drive him into print when so many much 
more capable people kept silent. "I have not 
the strong inward call," he declares, " nor 
cruel-sweet pangs of parturition, that prove the 
birth of anything bigger than a mouse." 

The world may well be thankful for " that 
very young -lady -like partiality to writing to 
those that I love." The only regret is that all 
his letters could not have been preserved. One 
feels tempted to say hard things of John Allen 
and James Spedding for their heedless destruc- 
tion or loss of the letters they received from the 
Laird of Littlegrange. The Chelsea sage bet- 
ter appreciated those kindly human messages; 
indeed, he complained that they came not often 
enough. It is difficult to write about these let- 
ters without transcribing whole pages of them, 
so happily do they picture the quiet life of the 
recluse. "I believe," he writes, " I love poetry 
almost as much as ever: but then I have been 
suffered to dose all these years in the enjoy- 
ment of old childish habits and sympathies, 
without being called on to more active and seri- 
ous duties of life. I have not put away childish 
things, though a man." Again, "I read very 
little : and get very desultory : but when winter 



comes again mast take to some dull study to 
keep from suicide, 1 suppose. The river, the 
sea, etc., serve to divert one now." To admir- 
ers of his matchless translations — his " impa- 
dencies," as he called them, referring to their 
wide departures from the original — the fol- 
lowing is of interest: 

" I suppose very few people have ever taken snch 
pains in translation as I have : though certainly not to 
be literal. But at all cost, a thing must live : with a 
transfusion of one's own worse life if one can't retain the 
original's better. Better a live sparrow than a stuffed 
eagle." 

His hearty dislike of the "ambition of fine 
writing" finds frequent expression. 

" Boccaccio's humor in his country people, friars, 
scolds, etc., is capital : as well, of course, as the easy 
grace and tenderness of other parts. One thinks that 
no one who had well read him and Don Quixote wonld 
ever write with a strain again, as is the curse of nearly 
all modern literature. I know that ■ easy writing is 

d d hard reading.' Of course the man must be a man 

of genius to take his ease : but if he be, let him take it. 
I suppose that snch as Dante, and Milton, and my Daddy 
[Wordsworth], took it far from easy: well, they dwell 
apart in the empyrean; but for human delight, Shake- 
speare, Cervantes, Boccaccio, and Scott I " 

To FitzEdward Hall he has something to 
say about so-called Americanisms. 

" I remember old Hudson Gumey cavilling a little 
at ■ realize,' as I innocently used the word in a memoir 
of my old Bernard Barton near thirty years ago: this 
word I have seen branded as American; let America 
furnish us with more such words; better than what oar 
« old English ' pedants supply with their ' fore- word ' for 
< preface,' ■ folk-lore,' and other snch conglomerate eon- 
sonants." 

The following, written forty-one years ago, is 
still timely: 

"We should give up something before it is forced from 
us. The world, I think, may justly resent our being 
and interfering all over the globe. Once more, I say, 
would we were a little, peaceful, nnambitions, trading 
nation, like — the Dutchl " 

Best of all FitzGerald's letters are those to 
Fanny Kemble, perhaps because they are to a 
woman whose sympathetic nature calls forth 
the writer's most intimate self-revealings. Here, 
too, the play of fancy is most unrestrained. 
His odd stringing together of ideas, each one 
suggesting the following, is often amusing. 
For example, he thus closes one letter : 

" Also I beg leave to say that nothing in Mowbray's 
letter set me off writing t^gain to Mrs. Eemble, except 
her address, which I knew not till he gave it to me, and I 
remain her very humble obedient servant, The Laird of 
Littlegrange — of which I enclose a side view done by a 
Woodbridge artisan for his own amusement. So that 
Mrs. Kemble may be made acquainted with the ' habi- 
tat ' of the flower — which is about to make an omelette 
for its Sunday dinner." 

Again and again he begs her to spare his eyes 



282 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



and not cross her letters, and especially not to 
cover her address (when she gives it) with 
cross-writing. He reiterates his entreaty that 
she shall not feel in the least obliged to answer 
his letters. The amiable quarrel over these 
matters, and the amusing criminations and 
recriminations regarding illegible penmanship, 
appear to have gone on to the end, each party 
to the friendly bickering having pet habits and 
whims that positively refuse to listen to dicta- 
tion — although we once find the lady spelling 
out her letter on a typewriter in a desperate 
attempt at clearness. 

Of FitzGerald's published prose, aside from 
his letters, the short preface to " Polonius " is 
the most characteristic. Its brief paragraphs 
are packed full of the writer's quaintly shrewd 
reflections. Of death he says one first realizes 
that he must die about the time he becomes con- 
scious of being a fool. The earlier " Eu- 
phranor," with its occasional suggestion of 
" fine writing," of which the author afterward 
found it guilty, shows us FitzGerald in some- 
thing nearer a studied pose than he elsewhere 
exhibits. 

Of FitzGerald as a poet these haphazard 
notes have said nothing, because he has thus 
been chiefly treated by others. That he was 
a master of that other harmony of prose, de- 
serves also to be emphasized. Perhaps the 
prime excellence of his style is its scorn of lit- 
erary finery. Never chasing after the one elu- 
sive best word, he yet never seems at a loss for 
a fitting expression ; and while his English is 
of the best, the reader feels that it is just such 
English as FitzGerald would use in familiar 
conversation. His modest estimate of his own 
verse finds expression in a letter to Bernard 
Barton. 

" I am a man of taste, of whom there are hundreds 
born every year: only that less easy circumstances than 
mine at present are compel them to one calling: that 
calling perhaps a mechanical one, which overlies all 
their other, and naturally perhaps more energetic im- 
pulses. As to an occasional copy of verses, there are 
few men who have leisure to read, and are possessed of 
any music in their souls, who are not capable of versi- 
fying on some ten or twelve occasions during their nat- 
ural lives: at a proper conjunction of the stars. There 
is no harm in taking advantage of such occasions." 

One item regarding the ^' Rubaij at." The first 
stanza originally appeared thus : 

"Awake! for morning in the bowl of night 
Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight; 

And lo! the hunter of the East has caught 
The Sultan's turret in a noose of light." 

Some sapient critic censured this as too literal 
a rendering of the Persian, whereas, as Mr. 



Edmund Gosse has pointed out, it is a render- 
ing of neither the Persian nor any other lan- 
guage. The admirable quatrain we owe purely 
to FitzGerald. But, as if to fall in with the 
joke and humor his critic, he twice altered the 
lines, how much to their ultimate detriment the 
reader may see by turning to the poem as it is 
now printed. 

That FitzGerald is coming to his own will re- 
joice his admirers. His coming to it is largely 
because he lays no claim to, nor even seems in 
any way burdened with a consciousness of, his 
desert. But we are like the gods : to him who 
scorns our charities our arms fly open wide.

MOUALITY AND THE RELIGIOUS lilFE.* 



The problem of presenting to a popular audience 
certain fundamental facts of ethics has been solved 
by Professor Palmer, in his work entitled " The 
Field of Ethics," in a manner that is novel, and at 
the same time interesting and successful. The most 
important terms in the vocabulary of the science are 
deBned, and its leading phenomena described by 
passing in review the affinities and differences be- 
tween a historical law and a law of morality, 
between the latter and the law of the state, between 
beauty and goodness of character, and between 
the religious and the moral life. The greatest 
amount of space is naturally devoted to this last 
topic. Every act, it is declared, may be regarded 
in a finite and an infinite way. In so far as it is 
performed in order to realize the best in human life, 
it is moral ; in so far as it is done for the sake of 
its infinite implications — for the love of God — it 
is religious. Actions are often performed with only 
the former end in view ; on the other hand, expe- 
rience shows that " a good many persons who are 
sincerely religious are not quite responsive to the 
demands of the moral code." But the life in which 
the finite and infinite are thus separated is pro- 
nounced mutilated and unsatisfying. The man who 
succeeds in realizing all that is best within him 
is he who walks in the light of both worlds, com- 
prehending their demands in a unity which only a

theoretical analysis can resolve into distinguishable 
elements. 

The comprehensive treatise of Professor Ladd 
on "The Philosophy of Conduct" will appeal to a 
different audience from that for which Professor 
Palmer wrote his lectures. It addresses itself to the 
specialist, and aims to make an original contribution 
to the theory of ethics. Professor Ladd does not 
believe that morality can be exhaustively defined 
as an instrument of human happiness. He sees that 
Hume is in error when he writes : " Utility is the 
aole source of that high regard paid to justice, fidel- 
ity, honor, allegiance, and chastity." This plus,how- 
ever, he is entirely unable to analyze ; and so the 
nature of morality is left in the end as unintelligible 
as at the beginning. Thereupon, as invariably hap- 
pens in such cases, recourse is had to a theological 
explanation. The unique and mysterious emotion of 
obligation appears as something directly implanted 
by God, and conscience as a si>ecially created chan- 
nel for the communication of the Divine WilL It 
is probable that this explanation will not satisfy the 
majority of moralists. There is a sense in which 
not merely the moral life, but the entire content of 
consciousness, will be admitted to be an emanation 
from the life of God. Few authorities, however, 
will agree that anything is gained by explaining 
any one of its elements, as instinct, memory, or 
conscience, by means of the creative fiat of Om- 
nipotence. If such a view be correct, little positive 
help toward the solution of the fundamental prob- 
lems of ethics will be found in Professor Ladd's 
treatise. Its main value lies in certain detailed de- 
scriptions which demonstrate the breadth and com- 
plexity of the moral experience and call attention to 
facts that have not infrequently been overlooked. 
The author's position on the relation of religious 
belief to morality is not easy to characterize in a 
few words. That such belief may. in a high degree, 
strengthen and steady the will to do right, is hardly 
open to serious doubt. The question which the mor- 
alist is called upon to answer is, rather, whether the 
moral life is possible without a religious foundation. 
From the main doctrine of Professor Ladd's book it 
ought to follow that the appeals of duty are ad- 
dressed to elements common to all men, whatever 
may be their thonghte about the supersensible 
world. This, in fact, is explicitly asserted to be the 
case. But the admissions made on one page of the 
book are almost immediately qualified on another, 
until the writer's real opinion becomes finally an 
enigma. This outer obscurity would seem to be the 
sign of an inner conflict whose contending forces are 
no mere creatures of logic, but rather the represen- 
tatives of powerful ideals, partially, but only par- 
tially, conscious of their incompatibility. 

After an interval of several years, the English 
translation of Part III. of Professor Wundt'g 
" Ethics " has followed the translations of Parts I. 
and II. These latter were reviewed in The Diai., 
Vol. 25. pp. 300-301 (Nov. 1. 1898). Of most in- 
terest in the new volume is the author's definition 



of morality. Right action, he holds, is action con- 
ducive to welfare; the welfare, however, is not that 
of any individual, but that of the community. The 
community is here thought of, not as a mere name 
for certain persons living in social relations, — it 
is an entity, composed indeed of such persons, but 
more permanent than they, and independent of any 
one of them as the body is independent of any one 
of its constituent cells. The ultimate grounds for 
Professor Wundt's position can be found only by 
connecting his ethical inquiries with the results of hu 
speculations in metaphysics. Bat however bolstered 
up, the position remains decidedly paradoxical ; and 
in the sixteen years that have intervened since ita 
publication in the German edition of the " Ethiea " 
it seems to have obtained few adherents. ProfeMor 
Wundt's view of the relation between religion and 
morality differs considerably from those above re- 
viewed. In Volume I. he shows in an interesting 
way that the majority of the forms of contemporary 
social life owe their origin to the religious ceremo- 
nies of our primitive ancestors. On the other hand, 
the objects of religious veneration are held to have 
had their source in the moral ideal itself. " That 
which man early feels to be the content of his moral 
consciousness, his imagination represents as a world 
objective and yet permanently related to himself." 
The destruction of this world by eritieism is inerit- 
able, but obviously its annihilation cannot destroy 
the forces that gave it birth. Not wholly devoid of 
religion, however, will be the morality of the future. 
The most important element of the religious con- 
sciousness is its outlook upon infinity. But the moral 
ideal presents before the race an endless task, the 
reduction of all individual wills to one great har- 
monious system. As this implication of right doing 
becomes increasingly clearer the religious attitude, 
thus defined, will become more and more habitual. 

Professor Schuyler's " Systems of Ethics " is an 
introductory work dealing with the subject in ita 
theoretical, practical, and historical aspects. The 
influence of Sidgwick and Janet seems to be most 
pervasive. In its comprehensiveness and catholicity 
the work repeats the note of the representative mod- 
ern treatises ; but its usefulness is marred by the 
author's failure to formulate dearly the problems 
of his science and to distinguish properly between 
the various answers that have been given to them. 

The account of the ethical theories and the moral 
ideas of the Hebrews recently written by Professor 
Lazarus, of Berlin, has now been made in part ac- 
cessible to English and American readers through 
the excellent translation of Miss Henrietta Szold. 
Professor Lazarus' work is unequal in value. The 
attempt to prove that the Hebrew writers had for- 
mulated the fundamental principles of the Kantian 
ethics must be pronounced unsuccessful. It is true 
that passages in the Old Testament can be cited 
which logically imply one or two — but not more — 
of these principles. But from this fact, as is shown 
by the history of Christian ethics, we can make no 
immediate inference to the theories actually held by

those who acknowledged its authority; and other 
data are not supplied us. Indeed, the conclusion 
is almost irresistible, even on Professor Lazarus' 
own showing, that the writers who gave to the world 
the Old Testament and the Talmud were innocent 
of any ethical theory whatever. On the other hand, 
the descriptions given of the moral ideals of the 
Hebrews is admirable. The most impressive fea- 
ture presented to the reader is the attitude taken 
toward the foreigner living in the land. The spirit 
in which he was treated, so far as law and Custom 
can regulate such matters, is faithfully exhibited in 
the words of the Levitical code : " The stranger that 
sojourneth with you shall be unto you as a home- 
born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself." 
Professor Lazarus is entirely justified in asserting 
that in this respect Judaism " occupies the most 
honorable place in ancient times." 

Professor Ritchie's " Studies in Political and 
Social Ethics " deals with a number of problems 
that concern, in the main, the application of ethical 
theories to the conduct of social life. In a series 
of eight essays are discussed, among other topics, 
the principles of state interference with individual 
liberty, the truth of the dogma of the equality of 
human rights, the casuistry of war, the help to be 
gained from biology in the solution of social prob- 
lems, and the possibility of a moral life without 
religious belief. It will be seen that the subjects 
are much the same as those treated with pretentious 
ignorance in certain recent well-known books. It is 
to be hoped that the popularity they have succeeded 
in achieving will fall to the share of this modest vol- 
ume. For Professor Ritchie knows whereof he 
speaks, and has things to say of which no student 
of social problems can afford to be ignorant. Prob- 
ably no elementary treatment of the subjects dis- 
cussed, comprehended within the covers of asingle 
book, could he recommended with equal confidence 
to the general reader.

Clever literary 

parodies 

and burlesques. 



Among the many books of Bret 
Harte not one is ^lore strictly a 
source of perennial delight than the 
" Condensed Novels " that he wrote, following an 
example set by Thackeray, early in his career. 
During the last years of his life, he set to working 
the vein once more, and we now have a posthumous 
second series of these happy burlesques (Houghton), 
in which some of the literary fashions of a later day 
are effectually parodied. The names of his recent 
victims will readily be inferred from such titles as 
"Rupert the Resembler," "Golly and the Christian," 
"Dan'l Borem," and "Stories Three." The first of 
these titles belongs to a production which is aloaost 
as good as the original, for Bret Harte was some- 
thing of a story-writer himself, and was not likely 



to be content with parody pure and simple. W& 
make room for one quotation. 

" Dan'l Borem ponred half of hia second cup of tea ab- 
stractedly into his lap. ' Gnesa you 've got sutbin' on yer 
mind, Dan'l,' said his sister. ' Mor 'n likely 1 've got sutbin' 
on my pants,' retorted Dan'l with that exquisitely dry, though 
somewhat protracted humor which at once thrilled and bored 
bis acquaintances." 

Enjoyable as these "Condensed Novels " are made 
by their combination of story-telling with rollicking 
burlesque, it must be admitted that as a parodist 
strictly speaking, Mr. Owen Seaman exhibits a finer 
art. His volume of " Borrowed Plumes " (Holt) 
is not only fun, it is also delicate literary criticism. 
More than a score of the popular writers of the day 
are used as targets for the deadly arrows of his wit, 
and his aim is always true. Mr. Maurice Hewlett's 
pseudo-archaism, for example, is thus deftly imi- 
tated : 

" But for relief of the pent roads there waa devised a hollow 
mine-way, auch as coneys affect; and engines, fitted thereto, 
to draw men through the midriff of earth, betwixt its crust 
and fiery omphalode. And it was named Le Tube k Deux 
Deniers ; for, fared they never so far, serf or margrave, dif- 
ference of price or person was there none." 

Here is Mr. Chamberlain done in Meredithian 
verse : 

" Behold him stand, 
Brummagem-factured, monocled, aloof. 
Unspoiled of admiration, envy-proof. 
Intolerably self-complete: 
Janus of War to ope and shut at will ; 
An orb of circumvolvent satellites, 
Portentous past belief." 

This quatrain is evoked from Poet Watson by the 
news that some misguided yokel has attributed 
" Abdul the D — d " to Parson Watson : 
" Great Muse ! and can it be this godless isle 
Breeds any so impervious of pelt 
That they confound my chaste and Greekish style 
With kailyard cackle of the so-called Kelt? " 

And this is the cruel fashion in which the common- 
place philosophy of Lord Avebury is mimicked : 

"Water is recognized as a necessity to ships. What should 
we do if anything went wrong with the ocean ? Suppose * the 
deep did rot ! ' (Coleridge)." 

"Much has been written about the 'uses of adversity,' 
Let us hope it is true." 



An American 

landscape 

architect. 



A pious duty has been performed in 
behalf of the memory of a life closed 
in its prime, by the compilation and 
publication of the volume entitled " Charles Eliot, 
Landscape Architect" (Houghton), the title-page 
going on to describe the subject of the memoir as 
"A lover of nature and of his kind, who trained 
himself for a new profession, practised it happily, 
and through it wrought much good." Charles Eliot 
was born in Cambridge, Mass., November 1, 1859, 
the son of the distinguished administrator and edu- 
cator, then assistant professor of mathematics and 
chemistry, and now and for many years the Presi- 
dent of Harvard University. Young Eliot's school- 
ing was had in Cambridge, and he was graduated 
cum laude from Harvard in the class of 1882, 
having shown during his college course, in his selec-

tion of stodies as well u in the manner in which 
he passed his vacations, some leaning toward the 
profession he was to select for his life-work. Bat 
his determination was finally made daring the sam- 
mer after gradaation, and he entered the Bassey 
Institation — virtually the agricnltural school of 
Harvard — the following aatamn, only to leave it 
for the office of Mr. Frederick Law Olmstead the 
next April. Here his life was varied hy study 
and work of various kinds, especially in the Arnold 
Arboretum, and by extended travel and observation 
in America and Europe. In 1886 he opened his 
own office in Boston, at a time when his profession 
was so little understood that he debated for a time 
whether he should call himself a landscape gardener 
or a landscape architect. The professional connota- 
tion of the latter phrase iueared its selection, and he 
soon secured a valuable clientage. Intimately con- 
cerned in the various steps which have been taken to 
give Boston so many beautiful glimpses into nature, 
he was made a member of the Olmstead firm early 
in 1893. Never very strong, but with excellent gen- 
eral health, he saccambed to an attack of cerebro- 
spinal meningitis, then epidemic. on March 24, 1897, 
leaving a widow and several children, and a large 
circle of devoted friends. The book which tells the 
simple and faithful story of this well-spent life is 
enriched with extracts from his jonrnals, letters, 
and public papers, and is not the least beaatifol 
of the many testimonials, all making for loveliness 
in life, which his profession has secured for his 
memory. 

It would almost seem as though two 
out of every three books on psycho- 
logical topics contributed more to 
the confusion than to the illumination of the prob- 
lems of mind. The one type of effort, represented 
in the present instance by Mr. H. Jamyn Brooks's 
"The Elements of Mind, being an Examination 
into the Nature of the First Division of the Ele- 
mentary Substances of Life" (Longmans). suggests 
an author of moderate ability, over-impressed with 
the sense of his own originality, not conversant 
with or appreciative of the real status of the prob- 
lems which he boldly attacks, yet capable of holding 
and setting forth with some acumen an elaborate 
and painfully wrought argument. The other type, 
represented by Mr. Albert B. Olston in "Mind 
Power and Privileges" (Crowell). is the result of 
failure to appreciate in any clear-cut fashion the 
real gist or spirit of scientific investigation, and a 
consequent obf uscation of a popular topic — the 
relation of the conscious to the sub-conscious activi- 
ties, and the possible utilization of the latter in the 
treatment of disease. The latter form of human 
document is now so widespread among us as to 
make relevant the query, whether and why this is 
a truly American form of intellectual failing. Both 
volumes reflect the danger of word-intoxication — a 
sort of transformed and modernised type of schol- 
asticism in which superficiality takes the place of 



over-erudition, and boldness of venture of a tradi- 
tion-bound narrowness of outlook. When the can- 
didate for the post of psychological expounder to 
the public has profoundly realized the difference 
between explanations that really explain and those 
that go through a mimic performance of this pro- 
cess, clever enough to deceive the casual onlooker, 
he has gone a long way toward rendering his ser- 
vices of real value. Neither of the present authors 
has made sufficient progress along this straight and 
narrow path. The volumes are not wholly bad (few 
books are), and that of Mr. Brooks shows evidences 
of some grasp ; yet both suggest quite unmistakably 
the need of a psychological adviser to some of oar 
prominent publishers.

Brussels, visit the field of battle, . . . and take 
Antwerp on their return. Tempted by this pro- 
posal . . . and being moreover in some degree 
bound to celebrate the greatest victory in British 
history, I persuaded myself that if any person had 
a valid cause or pretext for visiting the field of 
Waterloo, it was the Poet Laureate." It cannot 
be said that much came out of the journey in the 
way of poetry, but this simple and straightforward 
volume of prose is a worthy memorial of an occa- 
sion worth remembering. The manuscript remained 
in the hands of the Southey family, after the poet's 
death, until 1864. when it was bought by a well- 
known antiquarian, and it is only now that it has 
come into a publisher's hands. The resulting 
book is beautifully printed in the general style of 
Southey's time, forming in many ways a companion 
volume to the reprint of Thackeray's •* Mr. Brown's 
Letters to a Young Man about Town," issued last 
year. The paper is of the old fashion, and the 
binding of marbled paper boards with cloth back 
and paper label. The edition is limited to five 
hundred and nineteen numbered copies.

To correct the errors and misstate- 
ments of many historical writers, 
and to set down correcUy and pre- 
serve unstained the truth of history, is the aim of 
a monograph entitled " Colonel John Gunby of the 
Maryland Line'' (Robert Clarke Company) written 
by Mr. A. A. Gunby of Louisiana, presumably a 
descendant of the snbjeet of his sketch. Colonel

THE DIAL 



LNov. 1, 



Gunby was an eminent officer in the war of the 
Revolution, whose services in the cause of Amer- 
ican liberty were unstinted, and whose worth as a 
patriot and a soldier has always been conceded. 
But the accidents of the critical battle of Hobkirk's 
Hill, as set forth in the recitals and reports of 
General Nathaniel Greene, have given rise to the 
aspersion that Colonel Gunby's misconduct on that 
field, and the failure of his Maryland soldiers to 
sustain their previously fine reputation as fighters, 
caused the loss of that battle by the Americans. 
This version of the engagement has been perpet- 
uated by Bancroft, Senator Lodge, and Professor 
Fiske, in their histories. But Mr. Gunby brings 
against these historians the contrary evidence gath- 
ered by Moultrie, Colonel Henry Lee, Judge William 
Johnson, and Judge Marshall, whose conclusions are 
in favor of the conduct of both Colonel Gunby and 
his men, as gallant, skilful, and heroic. One unfor- 
tunate phase of this controversy is that all the 
critics of Gunby are Northern writers, and all of 
his champions are of the South. But the writer 
of this book certainly builds up a strong case in 
favor of both Gunby and his soldiers, and he does 
this without bitterness or even harshness toward 
General Greene, the author of the aspersions on 
Gunby. The monograph ably illustrates a most 
interesting and crucial hour in the history of the 
Revolutionary War. The high character of the 
author's patriotism is evidenced by his exaltation 
of the stage of action on which Gunby appeared 
as " the loftiest in the annals of the world." He 
seeks to illustrate " the true significance of the War 
of Independence," and he correctly characterizes it 
as a battle " for the recognition of the rights of man 
to self-government"; for such, in its last analysis, 
was the Revolutionary struggle. 

The good old word "confession" is 
certainly open to the charge of loss 
of seriousness in some of its recent 
manifestations. As used in Mr. Phipson's " Con- 
fessions of a Violinist" (Lippincott), for example, 
the word has very little of the esoteric cast. The 
anecdotes of travel, family history, and concerts, 
which it is made to cover, — one of them relating 
the discovery of a trap-door on a concert platform 
just in time to save the writer from precipitation, — 
are thoroughly light-hearted ; while the comments 
on great violinists and the bits of imaginative story- 
telling which make up the rest of the little volume 
are neither personal nor penitential. The book 
might well have been called "Apropos of the Vio- 
lin," since references to that instrument form the 
only thread of connection between these diverse 
subjects. Perhaps, however, the verdict should be 
" Confessions in the second degree," since some 
grounds for repentance are discoverable in the spirit 
of the book, which is sub-conscious, rather than in 
the matter, which is prepense. An exquisite exam- 
ple of this spirit is the author's reference to himself, 
quoted from a friend : " / have just heard Kvhdik, 



Con/estiom,

and olherwite. 



the new violinist, and I have often heard Joachim ; 
but many years ago there used to be an amateur, a 
Dr. Phipson, who lived at Putney, who was better 
than either of them ! " The italics are in the book. 
But, cavilling aside, the chapters on Rameau, Auber, 
Wieniawski, Artot, and others, though not developed 
enough to be very valuable, are interesting, and give 
some matter that is new. And one of the stories, 
"The 'Cello Player of Swartzfeld," is really 
delightful. 

Professor Reinsch's work on "Colo- 
Phase, of colonial ^j^j Government " (Macmillan) may 
disappoint those who depend upon 
the title alone as a promise of its contents. It is a 
collection of essays on phases of colonial expansion, 
and as such, lucid and entertaining, rather than a 
thorough and systematic treatment of the entire mat- 
ter involved. One section is devoted to the methods 
and motives of colonization ; and among the latter 
far too much credit is given to religious missionary 
zeal. This impression would be still stronger if the 
colonizations of ancient times were included in the 
survey. But even in modern times, more credit is 
due to commercial interest, governmental neces- 
sities, and the pressure for subsistence. Another 
section deals with certain forms of colonial govern- 
ment, containing a particularly interesting chapter 
on "Spheres of Influence," which shows the author's 
full understanding of modern world-politics, — a 
chapter well worth reading by anyone interested in 
the Eastern question. Part Three, though only a 
partial outline of present colonial administrative 
organizations, throws light on some of the troublous 
questions that now confront the United States. 
Those who undertake to change over-night the tra- 
ditions and customs and institutions of alien peoples 
might profitably read here the long list of failures 
in the attempt to " make over " oriental races. 
Merely by relating the lessons learned by the French 
and English in the far East at such a cost of blood 
and treasure. Professor Reinsch has justified the 
publication of his book. There are typographical 
errors not a few ; and fault may be found with the 
space given to bibliography — 40 pages in 386 — 
in a popular work. In the list of great colonial 
governors, page 249, the name of Sir George Grey 
is missing. The constitution of the Judicial Com- 
mittee of the Privy Council is criticized, pp. 360- 
51, because it does not contain a member learned 
in Hindu law ; whereas in fact at least one of the 
members of this committee has always been a man 
of considerable legal and judicial experience in 

India. 

In his volume entitled " The English 
Chronicle Play" (Macmillan), Pro- 
fessor Felix E. Schelling, of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, presents a study of the 
popular historical literature of the time of Eliza- 
beth. The dramatic being the most potent form of 
literary expression in that favored age, the Chron- 
icle Play was the crown of a deeply-rooted interest

in luBtorie tradition. It« extreme popularity dating 
the sixteenth century is ghown by Professor Schell- 
ing's list of over three hundred separat« dramas on 
English historical subjects. They began with the 
tide of patriotism which united all England to re- 
pel the threatened inr&sion by Spain; they flour- 
ished famously under Elizabeth, and lost their nar 
tional character under the un-English monarch 
James I. With little of the learning of the schools 
upon it, and less of the exotic culture of Italy, the 
Chronicle Play was but slightly related to other 
varieties of the drama, while it was very closely 
afiUiated to the wealth of historical literature, in 
verse and prose, that was springing up about it. 
Its importance is realized when we note that over 
a third of Shakespeare's plays are in this form, and 
that nowhere else is he seen to be so fully and so 
logically the product of his age. In Shakespeare's 
trilogy of Henry I"V. and V., the main stock of the 
Chronicle Play reached its height ; later, it passed 
beyond local and national limitations and strayed 
into regions of folk-lore and pseudo-history, becom- 
ing in " Lear " and " Macbeth " a world-drama of 
universal appeal. Finally, the romantic drama led 
the historical drama away from English topics to 
those of strange countries in which the fancy might 
wander and the playwright feel himself nntram- 
meled by the narrowing claims of consistency. 
Professor Schelling has done an important and 
original service in eliminating from the mingled 
elements of the English drama as a whole the his- 
tory of one particular type, which has been rather 
slighted by previous writers in order to give in more 
detail the Italian influences and the classical move- 
ment of the period. 

When the Reverend Edward Griffin 
Porter, of Lexington, Massachusetts, 
was gathering materials for a history 
of that town, to be read at the Centennial Celebra- 
tion of its famous Revolutionary battle, he entered 
into correepondence with the Duke of Northumber- 
land, as a result of which he was invited to visit 
Alnwick Castle. " While a guest there, a certain 
alcove and shelf were pointed out to him ; after 
glancing over numerous books, he espied, in an ob- 
scure corner, what proved to be a tin box covered 
thickly with dust, and tied with a frayed blue rib- 
bon. In answer to inquiry, the Duke's librarian 
told him that the box contained letters, but he never 
remembered to have seen it opened. It was dusted 
and opened forthwith, disclosing a budget of faded 
and yellow letters, the veritable ones that Earl 
Percy had written to his father, beginning at the 
moment of his landing in Boston, and ending at 
the time of his return to England. Mr. Porter had 
the satisfaction, with the permission of his host, of 
spending that day and the two succeeding ones 
copying these letters." The letters thus discovered, 
and others taken from the Reports of the Royal 
Commission of Historical Manuscripts, or from the 
collections of the Boston Public Library, have been

edited by Mr. Charles Knowlee Bolton, and are now 
published in an attractive little book of eighty-eight 
pages, under the caption, " Letters of Hngh Earl 
Percy from Boston and New York, 1774-1776" 
(Boston : Charles E. Goodspeed). Together, they 
make a valuable addition to Revolutionary War 
literature. The several letters which tell of the re- 
treat from Lexington and of the battle of Banker 
Hill are the most interesting, perhaps, although 
nearly every one contains some item of interest or 

value. 

Ththei^ ^<* phase of American history has 

f !*■■■ <■ « ever received more fascinating treat- 
ttafUwttmmt. ment than that to which Francis 
Parkman devoted the best energies of his life. For 
reading at once instructive and delightful, it would 
be difficult to find anything better than the series of 
masterly volumes which describe the epic effort of 
France to gain and maintain a foothold in the 
New World. They have nearly every sort of his- 
torical interest, from the romantic to the philo- 
sophical, and no one who has read them regrets the 
time spent in their company. But they number 
twelve large volumes, and life is short. To provide 
the reader of scant leisure with some notion or 
foretaste of this wealth of picturesque material. 
Dr. Pelham Exlgar has arranged the essentials of 
the whole history in a single volume which he calls 
"The Struggle for a Continent" (Little). The work 
is a continuous history, in Parkman's own words 
(except for a few connecting links marked by in- 
clusion in brackets), of the history of New France 
from the Huguenots in Florida to the fall of Quebec 
and the defeat of Pontiac It gives us the beet 
of Parkman in a series of about seventy-five short 
chapters, well furnished with portraits, maps, and 
other illustrative materiaL It is a most praise- 
worthy performance, and comes near to justifying 
the publishers' claim that " no book on American 
history has ever been published containing as much 
instruction and entertainment" Especially for the 
school library is this volume indispensable, and it is 
within the reach of the smallest of such collections.

Lovell Triggs is both historian and sociologist in 
the handsome book entitled " Chapters in the 
History of the Arts and Crafte Movement." pub- 
lished by the Bohemia Guild of the Industrial Art 
League of Chicago. In the historical spirit Mr. 
Triggs follows the trend of thought which, starting 
from Carlyle and Ruskin, reached practical and 
theoretical exposition in the person of William Mor- 
ris, and is now working oat through Mr. Ashbee 
in England and the Rockwood shops in the United 
States. Here the treatment is rather obvious, and 
little originality is to be looked for. But in the 
last of the chapters Mr. Triggs does say something 
new, when he comments on " The Development of 
Industrial Consciousness, " and the one fault to be 



288 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



found is the failure to take time and space to work 
the theme out fully and logically. Briefly stated, 
it is held that industrialism is passing through steps 
closely analogous to those that have attended the 
evolution of society in the political sense. Not long 
ago in a condition of industrial savagery, in which 
every man's hand was against his neighbor and un- 
restricted competition was the only accepted law, 
human society on the industrial side seems passing 
into a condition of feudalism, and mankind may 
yet see a general working out of Thomas Jeffer- 
son's dictum in effect, — " Who controls a man's 
subsistence, controls the man." But as feudalism led 
to constitutional monarchy and it in turn to dem- 
ocracy, so a similiar advance toward individual free- 
dom may be looked forward to in industrial life. 
Mr. Triggs does not develop the idea that the in- 
creased tension and speed of modern life may ac- 
complish in decades what used to be the work of 
centuries ; but neither does he work out his central 
thought fully at any point, though it abundantly 
deserves a volume of its own. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. J. Potter Briscoe has made a collection of " Tudor 
and Stuart Love Sougs," and the volume (one of the 
prettiest of the season) is published by Messrs. £. P. 
Dutton & Co. The selections begin with Wyatt and 
Surrey, and run down well into the eighteenth century. 
Nearly fourscore poets are represented, mostly by one 
or two examples. Herrick, with four lyrics, occupies a 
place by himself. Many of the old favorites are here, 
and many other songs less familiar to the average 
reader. 

" The Works of Francis Bacon " and " The Poetical 
Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley " are two new volumes 
in the series of thin paper editions imported by the 
Messrs. Soribner. The precept of mullum in parvo is 
not often as well illustrated as in these dainty and com- 
panionable volumes. The Bacon, in particular, is a 
treasure, including as it does all of the prose that any 
one but a specialist cares to read. From the same source 
we have, in the " Caxton Series," a two-volume reprint 
of Irving's " Sketch Book," also most attractive and 
profitable. 

Professor Benjamin Terry has written, and Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co. have published, "A History of 
England from the Earliest Times to the Death of Queen 
Victoria." It is a bulky volume of no less than eleven 
hundred pages, and the narrative is both easy and ani- 
mated. The work is comparable in size with the single 
volume histories of Green and Gardiner, and is well 
adapted for teaching purposes. We consider its gen- 
erous dimensions an advantage for that use, especially 
in high schools, for the average student, no matter how 
much he is urged, will rely chiefly upon the text that is 
in his own possession. This being the case, the more 
material offered him the better, and there is certainly 
no lack of material in Professor Terry's volume. Con- 
stitutional and social developments occupy a large space 
in this work, which thus represents the best modern 
opinion in the teaching of the subject.

" Interpretative Reading," by Miss Cora Marsland, 
is a volume of selections for elocutionary purposes, 
combined with exercises in vocalization and gesture. 
It is published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

Messrs. Newson & Co., publish a prose translation of 
" Beowulf " based upon Wyatt's text, and made by Mr. 
Chauncey Brewster Tinker. The translator has per- 
mitted himself a reasonable freedom, and bis version 
reads easily and interestingly. 

" Popular Literature in Ancient Egypt," by Dr. A. 
Wiedemann, and " The Heroic Mythology of the 
North," by Miss Winifred Faraday, are the latest issues 
in Mr. David Nutt's pamphlet series of studies, already 
many times noted in these columns. 

"Strange Lands Near Home," published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co., is a geographical reader for very young 
people. It is the work of several hands, among the 
authors being Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mr. Joaquin 
Miller, and Mr. Frederick Schwatka. 

" A Book of Old English Ballads," edited by Mr. 
Hamilton W. Mabie, and illustrated by Mr. George 
Wharton Edwards, appears to be a reprint without 
alterations of the volume as first published six years 
ago. It comes from the Macmillan Co. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a " Handbook on Linear 
Perspective, Shadows and Reflections," by Mr. Otto 
Fnchs; also in the same field, Mr. O. E. Randall's 
"Shades and Shadows and Perspective," a text-book 
based on the principles of descriptive geometry. 

Anew edition of "The Seven Little Sisters," by Miss 
Jane Andrews, has just been published by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. This old-time favorite of children is provided in 
its new form with several colored illustrations, and a 
memorial of the author by Mrs. Louisa Parsons Hopkins. 

Mr. Ell wood P.Cubberley is the author of a " Syllabus 
of Lectures on the History of Education," published 
by the Macmillan Co. This is no mere pamphlet pro- 
duction, but a stout octavo, very full in its analysis, 
and provided with copious bibliographical references. 
It covers a three years' course of lectures. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish a new library 
edition, in six volumes, of the works of Samuel Lover. 
" Rory O'More," " Handy Andy," and " Treasure 
Trove" occupy three volumes of the six, the remaining 
three containing, respectively, the poems, the dramatic 
works, and the legends and stories of Ireland. Each 
volume has an etched frontispiece. 

" Colonial Children," and " Camps and Firesides of 
the Revolution," are the titles of the first two volumes 
in a new series of source-readers in American history, 
edited by Professor A. B. Hart and Miss Mabel Hill. 
The volumes are illustrated, and both the spelling and 
the language of the selections have been modernized. 
The Macmillan Co. publish this series. 

The Messrs. Scribner import the fourth edition of 
Baedeker's " Southern France," which includes also the 
island of Corsica as well as Geneva and its neighbor- 
hood. There are no other such guide-books as these, as 
every traveller knows, and not the least of their merits 
is found in the frequency with which they are brought 
down to date by conscientious revisions. 

We noticed a few months ago the English-German 
section of the new edition of Grieb's Dictionary, as pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde. The German-English 
section of the work is now at hand, a volume of twelve 
hundred pages of three columns each. Dr. Arnold 
Schroer is the editor of this enlarged form of a work that 



has long been favorably known. In his very interesting 
preface, the editor discusses the underlying principles 
npon which the dictionary is based, and points out the 
difficulties that spring from the lack of a generally 
accepted standard of German pronunciation. Inciden- 
tally, he says a good word for the pronunciation cur- 
rent in Berlin, and for the language as spoken on the 
German stage. 

To the " Windsor " edition of the novels of William 
Harrison Ainsworth, published by the J. B. Lippincott 
Co., there have been added two volumes of "The Miser's 
Daughter," two of " Crichton," and one of "The Spend- 
thrift." These five new volumes complete the set of 
twenty, and bring the entire work of this good old- 
fashioned novelist once more within the easy reach of 
the public. 

Three more preprints from the " Decennial Publica- 
tions of the University of Chicago " are at hand. They 
are, respectively, " On Amorphous Sulphur," by Messrs. 
Alexander Smith and Willis B. Holmes; "the Pro- 
consulate of Julius Agricola," by Mr. George Lincoln 
Hendrickson; and "A Greek Hand-Mirror: A Can- 
tharus from the Factory of Brygos," by Mr. Frank 
Bigelow Tarbell. 

The New Amsterdam Book Co. publish a neat two- 
volume edition of Alexander Mackenzie's "Voyages from 
Montreal through the Continent of North America to 
the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in 1789 and 1793." This 
work, which includes " A General History of the Fur 
Trade from Canada to the North- West," is one of the 
classics of early American exploration, and its reissue in 
the present convenient form is a real boon. 

" Little Masterpieces of Science," edited by Mr. 
George lies, is a series of six small volumes just pub- 
lished by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. The titles of 
the several volumes are as follows: "Mind," "Explor- 
ers," "The Naturalist," "Skies and Earth," "Health 
and Healing," and " Invention and Discovery." Each 
volume contains eight or ten papers, often condensed 
from larger works, and mostly written by men of high 
aothority. 

The two substantial volumes of Sir Leslie Stephen's 
" History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury " (Putnam) reappear in a third edition of this 
great work. The author has corrected the work in some 
respects, but admits that he has not given it the thor- 
oughgoing revision that he could have wished. " I have 
discovered," he says, " that it was written with an au- 
dacity or light heartedness which I no longer possess. 
I made blunders and I gave estimates of various books, 
corrections of which might be suggested by later read- 
ing and reflection. To make the book fully satisfactory 
even to myself would require the rewriting of a consid- 
erable part. But, in the first place, I am not sure that 
I should not spoil instead of improving ; and, in the 
second place, I am now quite unequal to a task which 
would demand much time and labor." 

"English History Told by English Poets" (Mac- 
millan) is a reader for school use, compiled by Miss 
Katharine Lee Bates and Mrs. Katharine Coman. It 
is quite as important to study the history of England 
in its noblest literature as it is to delve in its dusty 
chronicles, and we welcome this book as a reaction 
against the tendency which seeks to make original in- 
vestigators of our boys and girls of tender age. Here 
are some four hundred pages of good poetry, chrono- 
logically arranged, and supplied with what few notes

TWO XEIV BOOKS BY MRS. RICHARDS 



FOR ADULT READERS 
Fifth Edition 

Mrs. Tree 

Bv Laura E. Richards. 
A short novel of irresistible charm and orig- 
tnalit)-. A companion volume to '* Geoffrey 
Strong," Mrs. Richards's great success of last 
year. The author won international fame by her 
children's ston^, " Captain January," and now 
makes it clear that she is equally at home in the 
field of adult fiction. The Detroit Free Press is not 
alone in thinking ".Mrs. Tree" "the jolliest,mer- 
riest, drollest book Mrs. Richards ever wrote." 
Unique binding, illustrated, tall 16mo . 75 cts. 



FOR CHILDREN 

The Hurdy-Gurdy 

By Laura E. Richards 
A book of original and diverting nonsense 
rhymes. Everj- poem has an illustration by J. 
J. Mora. These jingles are hardly less captivat- 
ing than the immortal lyrics of Lear and Lewis 
Carroll. For ingenious rhymes, for fluency of 
fancy, and for pure fun, they are unapproached 
in modern child literature. The pictures by 
Mr. Mora are irrcsistably amusing, and are 
worthy of the droll and clever verses.

THE LORD PROTECTOR 

A Story. By S. Levett Yeats, author of "The 
Chevalier D'Auriac," " The Heart of Denise." With 
frontispiece. Crown 8vo, cloth, ornamental, 81.50. 
In this story the anther has taken a new departure and 
has portrayed as his central character one of the most 
striking figures in English history. The picture of Crom- 
well differs somewhat from the ordinarily accepted esti- 
mate of the Protector, and is an interesting one from that 
point of Tiew.

Cooper. Crown 8vo, cloth, ornamental, $1.50. 

" * M. E. Francis's * Dorset peasants put one in mind of Mr. 

Hardy*8 great creations in that line. Mrs. Blundell possesses a rare 

gift of humor, the humor that is never forced or overdone, the 

humor that leaves the reader to do his share and suggests instead of 

telling everything. She has, too, the gift of tears, and can by a di- 

rect, simple touch of pathos bring sjrmpathetic moisture to the eyes 

that have scarce done smiling at some homely turn of speech or some 

shaft of rustic wit.** — London Time*.

** A romance quite worthy of being classed with 'Lorna Doone.* '* 
— London Morning Leader. 

" The characters are well drawn and real without being conven- 
tional. The quality of the book which makes it worth reading— and, 
no doubt, caused it to be written— is the knowledge it shows of gypsy 
life and gypsy feelings." — London Timet,

THE sweetness, the grace, the laughter, and the tenderness that 
are characteristic of Mr. Riley's best verse are found to the full 
in this book of charming poems for and about children. The types 
are, of course, Hoosier, but the traits of human nature in its most 
lovable and winning childlike moods are common to humanity and 
give the book a universal interest. The illustrations have been 
made under the author's supervision, and portray the scenes and 
the little heroes and heroines of the poems with artistic fidelity.

""THE LondcH Spectattr sajs: "This b really a good book, fiill of learning and full of thought — learning 
^ which illustrates and never confuses, well digested, and consequently adding to the vital power of the

An unabridged reprint of this valuable work on the famous Iroquois Indiaos. The original edition

Cadwallader Colden was considered the best informed man in the British-American Colonies ou Indian 

affairs. He was Surveyor-General of the Colony of New York, and by reason of bis official position had 

access to sources of information not usually open to writers, of which he made full use. His book is a 

masterpiece in its intimate and comprehensive review of Indian life.

SIR ALEXANDER MACKENZIE'S journey to the unknown regions of the wild north and his explor- 
ation of the great Mackenzie River from its sources to the Arctic Ocean may easily rank among the greatest 
achievements on this continent. In view of the fact that the opening of the territory west of the Rocky 
Mountains followed quickly after Mackenzie's Voyages, and the great Hudson Bay Company immediately 
started to stud the whole northern country with small trading posts, the quiet, unimpassioned story of the 
sturdy Scotchman's victory over almost incredible privations and obstacles is invaluable as a contribution to 
our knowledge of early American exploration.

past quarter of a century. There have been few great events in the history of the country during 
Citizen Train's lifetime in which he has not had some active interest or personally taken some part. 
His experiences were so numerous that it has been a great difficulty to condense his narrative into con- 
venient limits for a single volume. 



APPLETONS' BUSINESS SERIES 

FUNDS AND THEIR USES 

A Treatise on Instruments, Methods, and Institutions in Modern Finance. By Dr. F. A. CLEVELAND, 
of the University of Pennsylvania. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25 net; postage 12 cents additional. 
In these days of colossal monetary expenditures, the manipulation of private financial enterprises has 

become a science in itself. Dr. Cleveland has gone exhaustively into the subject, and the results of his study 

are systematically set forth. The literature on the subject is decidedly meager, and Dr. Cleveland's addition 

can be welcomed as an authoritative volume in this branch of economic science.

Thirty-third Thousand 
By HARRY LEON WILSON Price, $i.so 

BOOK NEWS says: 

" ' The Spenders ' is pre-eminently an American book, — American in name, American 
in bigness, American in crudeness, American in fearlessness, but, most of all, American in a 
great tender-heartedness, that comes out into the sunshine without fear and with jovousness."

NEW YORK MAIL AND EXPRESS says: 

" This is a book of action, of movement. It has its touches of humor, its moments of 
strenuous manliness. It is a good patriotic tonic, a wholesome book for Americans to read. 
And, next to that quality, the one that gives it most interest is undoubtedly that of pictur- 

esqueness."

the clearest ease of style. 

Memories of a Hundred Years

There is no city in the country without analogous situations, hence the 
book's wide general interest.

A NOBLE ENTERPRISE. 

We read occasionally of some weary million- 
aire, oppressed by the responsibilities of his 
wealth, whose chief desire is to play the park 
of the good steward, but whose imagination is 
painfully barren of ideas. He wishes to be 
helpful to his own and the succeeding genera- 
tions, he occupies an ethically sound position 
in regarding his possessions as held in trust for 
the public, but he can think of nothing less 
hackneyed than the endowment of a school, a 
lilH*ary, or a hospital. These are excellent 
purposes, every one of them, and such founda- 
tions can hardly be multiplied in excess of the 
public need, but they are far from exhausting 
the possibilities of philanthropic endeavor. The 
man who devises a new outlet for philanthropy 
becomes a public benefactor in a double sense, 
for, while making his contribution to humanity, 
be at the same time enlarges the horizon of his 
class and discloses new aspects of human help- 
fulness. Mr. Carnegie's recent activities have 
given some notion of the wide range of the 
good that may be wrought by a mind that has 
some fertility of suggestion, and the brilliant 
conception of the late Cecil Rhodes may almost 
be said to have projected a new idea into the 
philanthropic field. 

New ideas of this sort, or ideas that hav» 
even the touch of novelty, are not so common 
that we can afford to pass by the most modest 
of them. The subject of the present article is 
an idea of Mr. Edwin Ginn, the well-known 
publisher of educational books, an idea which 
is perhaps as nearly novel as we have any right 
to expect, and to which its sponsor proposes to 
give practical effect as far as may be done by 
the application of a considerable share of both 
his time and his fortune. The idea is that of 
promoting an extensive educational propaganda 
in the interests of the world's peace, of arousing 
in the consciousness of the serious-minded por- 
tion of the public some sense of the enormous 
folly of national armaments and of the war- 
fare which they necessarily tend to provoke. 
" Deeply impressed,'" says Mr. Ginn, " by onr 
obligations as Americans at this juncture in 
onr history, I have felt that the most effec- 
tive influence against the military spirit would

[Nov. 16, 



be the wide circulation among our people of 
the best international books, condemning the 
methods of force and inculcating the methods 
of reason in the settlement of all the rivalries 
and differences between nations." 

What Mr. Ginn proposes is, in brief, the 
organization of a society under some such name 
as " The International Union," having for its 
purpose the promotion of the cause of peace 
and international disarmament. As a first step 
toward such an organization, he has enlisted 
the services of that zealous worker in many 
good causes, Mr. Edwin D. Mead, under whose 
editorial supervision a series of publications 
will be undertaken. The literature of the peace 
movement is already considerable, but much 
good work may be done by making this liter- 
ature more generally accessible. The initial 
publication of the series is a translation of the 
late Jean de Bloch's epoch-making work on 
" The Future of War " — not the complete work 
in its formidable array of volumes, but the 
single-volume summary of the whole. This 
book is now offered to the public at the price 
of fifty cents a copy, which is about the cost of 
production, and it is expected that funds will 
be forthcoming for its free circulation among 
those to whom even this moderate price may 
prove an obstacle. The next publication will be 
a volume containing the three great peace ora- 
tions of Charles Sumner — " The True Grand- 
eur of Nations," "The War System of Nations," 
and "The Duel between France and Germany." 
Among other peace classics that may soon see 
the light in popular form are Penn's " Plan 
for the Peace of Europe," and Kant's "Eternal 
Peace." We would suggest on our own account 
as particularly suitable for this purpose a vol- 
ume of selections from the writings of John 
Ruskin and a cheap English edition of Frau 
von Suttner's famous novel, " Die Waffen 
Nieder." This series of publications may be 
counted upon to exert a widely beneficient in- 
fluence, and no other missionary enterprise can 
be half as important as that of bringing the 
light of such books into the dark places of the 
world of statecraft. 

Mr. Mead's prospectus of the undertaking is 
introduced by the following eloquent appeal : 

" The experiences of America and England during 
the last five years have been such as to force home in 
all sober and thoughtful circles the inquiry how really 
desirable international ends may be and ought to be 
achieved. The Hague Convention and Tribunal, es- 
tablished in this very time, are a beacon to the nations. 
Every good citizen of every land is called upon to reen- 
force the sentiment which called them into being, and 



to hasten the time when the International Tribunal shall 
fulfill for a united world the office which our Supreme 
Court has for a century so beneficently fulfilled for the 
United States. Is it not the duty of our country to be 
the leader of the nations in this work of universal organ- 
ization, disarmament and peace ? Let the < Americani- 
zation of the world,' of which men at home and abroad 
are now talking so much, find its chief and real character 
and distinction in the spread throughout the world of 
the highest ideals of good government and good educa- 
tion, the lending of the helpful hand, and love and justice 
between man and man. Let us jealously hold the repub- 
lic up to the level of its best ideals, and let us keep our 
children in the schools and our families in their homes 
alive to those ideals and to their duties in behalf of peace 
and order and the rights and welfare of mankind." 

Here is an educational ideal for which no Amer- 
ican need blush, a declaration of principles 
standing in the sharpest of contrasts with those 
by which the Republic has been so grievously 
led astray during its recent access of emotional 
insanity on the subject of warfare. 

Having quoted Mr. Mead in the abstract, let 
us now quote him in the concrete. Speaking 
at the Mohawk Arbitration Conference of last 
May, he used the following striking illustration: 

" There is no subject on which our people are more 
at sea than on this of patriotism. I saw the other day 
a picture which was one of the most mournful I ever 
saw, but one of the most natural, — mournful precisely 
because so natural. It was a picture which bore the 
title, ' A Lesson in Patriotism,' — and the picture was 
of an old man in his shirt-sleeves showing a boy a gun. 
Now I say that was the most natural picture in the 
world and the most natural title ; but it is the precise 
measure of our civilization — or of our barbarism. The 
fact is that the general public has got no further yet in 
this whole question of patriotism than that the gun is 
the natural symbol of it. All honor to the gun when it 
is used in its place, — I am not the kind of man to 
apologize for Lexington or Bunker Hill ; but so long 
as the boys and girls of this country grow up with the 
notion that the gun and the soldier are the only proper 
symbols of patriotism, then we are yet, I say, in the 
age of barbarism." 

Mr. Mead rightly says that " the schools must 
be captured for peace." How much this means 
will be fully appreciated only by those who 
know by experience the vainglorious and 
mournful stuff that is still foisted upon our 
school children in the name of patriotism. 
The thoughtful teacher looks forward with ap- 
prehension if not with terror to the occasional 
memorial exercise that is supposed to inculcate 
the lesson of patriotism in the school, for he 
knows that the performance will at its best be 
merely perfunctory, and at its worst may be 
subversive of all the finer ethical standards — 
that it is likely to substitute emotion for rea- 
son, to do lip-service to ideas that have their 
proper content carefully concealed, and to en- 
courage that fatal complacency which lies at the

root of most of the evils of our national life. 

Yes, there is work to be done in the schools, 
but not of the kind that is now being done ; 
and there is work to be done in the homes, 
bat not of the kind that is wrought by news- 
paper editorials and the reports of political 
leaders : and, above all, there is work to be 
done in the hearts of men without regard to 
the delicate sensibilities that take offence at the 
least suggestion of what, with amusing inac- 
curacy, is commonly styled pessimism. And 
the wide circulation of what the really great 
thinkers of the world have said about the folly 
of warfare is one of the most effective means 
of making that folly apparent. Perhaps the 
time is more nearly ripe for the advent of the 
gospel of peace than surface indications would 
lead us to imagine. It is true that there have 
been needless wars in our own times, and that 
the most distressingly wanton of them all has 
been waged by our own dear country, but there 
has been no mortal struggle between two great 
powers since the Second Empire of the French 
went down in shame more than thirty years ago. 
And the nightmare vision of such a struggle 
seems to be less of an obsession upon the Eu- 
ropean consciousness than it was a few years 
ago. The grimly suggestive phrase attributed 
to Bismarck — saigner a hlanc — as indi- 
cating Germany's future treatment of her 
enemies should occasion arise, foreshadowed a 
possibility that the European chancelleries have 
grown less and less willing to face. And now 
we have the plain unsentimental argument of 
M. de Bloch, happily fortified at almost every 
point by the experience of the English in South 
Africa, to the effect that the next war between 
two powers of the first class will prove a stale 
mate and force them both into bankruptcy. 
On the whole, it seems to us that the advocates 
of peace and disarmament have hit upon some- 
thing very like the psychological moment for a 
revivified endeavor in behalf of their most 
sacred cause. 

It was something like half a century ago 
that Horace Mann wrote these words : " If a 
thousandth part of what has been expended in 
war and preparing its mighty engines had been 
devoted to the development of reason and the 
diffusion of Christian principles, nothing would 
have been known for centuries past of its ter- 
rors, its sufferings, its impoverishment, and its 
demoralization, but what was learned from 
history." The fact that nineteen centuries of 
Christianity have failed to bring about even so 
imperfect an approximation to the Christian 



ideal as the mere cessation of warfare among civ- 
ilized peoples is certainly discouraging enough, 
and at times plunges the strongest of souls into 
the mood of bitter indignation that has been 
voiced by Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Hardy, 
Such moods are even salutary if they are but 
temporary, if they may be dispelled by some 
ringing sursum corda of the nobler self. Per- 
haps, after all, it may be reserved for the 
twentieth century to do what the preceding 
centuries have failed to do. We, at least, who 
live in the youth of a century that may be 
hopeful because it is young, will do well to 
keep still in view the vision of the sages, and 
to believe that, if reason ever comes to triumph 
in the affairs of men, the glory of its victory 
will be, not to the "too quick despairers," but 

to those who 

" Marched breast forward, 
Never doubted eloads would break, 
Never dreamed, tbongh rigbt were worsted, wron^ 

would trinispb, 
Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better. 
Sleep to wake." 



THE LOST ART OF BLANK VERSE. 

In oDe of Tennyson's letters, he makes an entha- 
siastic mention of Keata ; and then goes on to say: 
" Bat Ke&ts's blank verse is bad." This is enough 
to make one stare. Tennyson's own blank verse is 
admirable for the purpose to which he best puts it 
— the composition of idylls, of little pictures com- 
plete in themselves. It winds like a brook among 
meadows and copses, dallying with its own beauty, 
and so delighted with the images it reflects that it 
is loth to leave them and harry on. Bat Keats's 
blank verse — the verse of "Hyperion" — has a large- 
ness, vividness, swiftness, stride, that fit it for epic 
uses. It has not discarded all saperflaoas beauty and 
become mere sinewy strength, like Shakespeare's 
later verse; nor is it crusted and overloaded with 
ornament and pomp, like Milton's greatest lines. 
It combines simplicity with sensaousne^s, and is, I 
should say, the best model of English narrative 
poetry. 

Blank verse is largely a thing of the past. It is 
an instrument of speech iotellectaal and spiritnal, 
and has shared in the decline of intellectual and spir- 
itual things. The immense tangle of later lyric 
growths has choked out the monarchs of the forest 
of poetry. Lyric poetry, even of the most intricate 
kind, is really simpler in form, easier of apprehen- 
sion, more obvious. The difiference between good 
blank verse and most lyric measures is the differ- 
ence between violin playing and a brass band. 

°° Then blov the trumpet, sound the fife; 
To all the aensnal world proclaim 
One crowded hour of glorioni life 
Is worth SB age without a name."

How quick is the appeal of that to the ear ! how 
instant the answer in the heart ! But take 

"As when upon a tranced summer night 
Those green-robed senators of ancient woods. 
Tall oaks, branch charmed by the earnest stars, 
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, 
Save from some gradual solitary gust. 
Which comes upon the silence and dies off 
As if the ebbing air bad but one wave." 

That is a matter for reverie, for profound study. 
Its music rises and swells and branches into dis- 
tinct strains, and loses itself in the distance, or is 
multiplied with reduplicated echo. It only sur- 
renders its whole beauty to the finest ear. But lyric 
poetry is for everybody. It is, in a way, gross and 
palpable. It has all its sign-posts set out to assure 
the most inattentive that he is reading poetry. 

Measured motion and ordered repetition form 
the basis of every metrical scheme that has hitherto 
been invented. One or the other, or both, must be 
present in any speech that assumes to be verse. 
Greek and Latin poetry include both ; but their 
chief characteristic is the repetition of long and 
«hort syllables in regular successions. Modern 
poetry being entirely accentual, has lost this gift of 
quantity. It is not that we do not have syllables 
which differ in the time required for their utterance, 
but that in most cases it makes little odds how we use 
them. We can substitute long for short, or short 
for long, without altering the flow of the verse. 

That this disregard of quantity has resulted in a 
loss of fixity and sculpturesque character in poetry, 
is certain. Probably every modern language has 
tried to substitute something in its place. Rhyme 
is a general substitute. The Scandinavian Sta- 
breim, which repeats an alliteration three times in 
each verse, and the Spanish Asonante, which dis- 
tinguishes and binds the lines together by many 
repetitions of a final vowel, are other inventions. 
The old Irish Dyevvie verse is the most intricate and 
curious attempt to get order and fixity into verse. 
To appearance, it is hardly metrical at all ; but in 
its correspondences and replications of consonantal 
and vowel sounds, it is one of the most remarkable 
instruments of speech ever fashioned, and, to ears 
familiar with it, probably one of the most harmo- 
nious. In English, the csesural verse of Pope was 
an attempt at classic symmetry. More interesting 
still, the verse of Coleridge's " Christabel," with its 
four regular beats, was really an effort in the same 
direction. 

It must be admitted that English blank verse, 
starting with alack of quantity, and then discarding 
rhyme, discarding regularity of alliteration, discard- 
ing sequences of long and short lines, discarding beat 
of syllables, has almost stripped itself of poetry's in- 
heritance of symmetry. Its only legal hold on form 
is the slight stress or halt at the end of the tenth syl- 
lable. But that is enough. It gives to blank verse a 
security of law, a limit which prevents it from being 
ungovernable. There is, indeed, no immutable edict 
dictating ten syllables as a necessity, and poets like 



Blake and Whitman have lengthened their lines and 
still preserved a metrical pace. But their irregular- 
ities in the use of their metre prevent the pleasure 
of recognizable restraint. The attempt to ignore 
the separation of lines in blank verse, and to read 
it, as it is claimed, naturally, is a barbarism. Goethe 
and Schiller fought against this heresy all their lives 
at the Weimar theatre, but it comes back again and 
again to plague us on the stage. To read blank 
verse thus is to turn it into prose. And the prose 
of writers like Jeremy Taylor, De Qaincey, and 
Ruskin has many of the qualities and much of the 
art of poetry. But it has no rhythm, — for rhythm 
cannot exist without the regular and marked re- 
currence of movement and pause. DeQuincey named 
the style of prose in which he excelled " periodic 
prose." But periodicity is exactly what it does not 
possess. It draws no magic circle about it in which 
to perform its miracles. It is amorphous — without 
form or organic life. 

What, then, are the advantages of blank verse? 
They are freedom and fluidity within limits. Lyric 
verse is formal. It is a park where "grove nods 
to grove, — each alley has its brother." Lyric verse 
is like a sedimentary formation with its stratas in 
parallel and regular bands. Blank verse is the same 
formation seized upon by igneous action and the 
stratas twisted, contorted, plicated almost out of 
recognizance. The popularity of lyric verse is due 
to the fact that it is easy for the eye and ear to 
catch its symmetries of arrangement; but the 
trained mind will prefer to follow out the hints and 
glimpses by which law reveals itself in blank verse. 

It may he laid down as a rule that blank verse, 
to be good, must include all the characteristics of 
the other forms of poetry I have mentioned. It 
must be strewn with alliterations, assonances, and 
sequences of vowel sounds. But it must hold all 
these in solution, — they must not be obvious and 
obtrusive. They must give us pleasure without our 
knowing why ; the airy beings must do their spiriting 
without our seeing them. There is probably no line 
or group of lines in Milton's epic without a domin- 
ant alliteration or a vowelled concert. 

" Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit 
Of that forbidden tree," — etc. 

English heroic verse, written in enjambments, — 
in paragraphs, that is, rather than couplets, — has 
much of the ease and fluidity of blank verse. Bat 
the halt at the end of every line is too marked. It 
is like riding on a race-course with a barred fence 
at every tenth stride. The rhymed poem which 
most successfully copies the freedom of blank verse 
is Milton's " Lycidas." Here the rhymes are in a 
measure hidden by their irregularity, and still more 
by their frequency ; for it is a law of verse that the 
oftener a rhyme is repeated the less obvious it be- 
comes. Of course, in making these comparisons it 
is mainly iambic verse of which I am thinking. 
Spondaic and anapaestic rhythms are brilliant ex- 
otics. They have little real root in the language.

Their movement is not the nataral movement of the 
English tongae. To speak without book, I shoald 
say that nine-tenths of the lyric poetry in Palgrave's 
" Golden Treasury " is what we call iambic verse. 
I would say also that I am now dealing only with 
the technique of poetry, leaving out of view entirely 
its soul of thoughts and garb of phrase. The one 
solid distinction between poetry and prose is metre 
— measured motion. There is no reason why prose 
should not have all the other poetic qualities ; and 
it often does. Possibly the movement of poetry 
helps its writer to attain that frenzy which Plato 
demands of the poet, — as the whirling of the Sibyl 
was supposed to produce inspiration. In practice, 
this m ust be the case ; for in every language the most 
heightened thought and quickened phrase are to be 
found in verse. 

Blank verse is oar great English instrument of 
sounding speech. It has been found equally fitted 
for dramatic, epic, and reflective poetry. Marlowe 
fashioned the instrument first, and gave it a capacity 
for fiery energy and crashing volume of sound. 
But he left it somewhat monotonous and over-keyed. 
Shakespeare took it, and broke up Marlowe's mighty 
line, and gave it every variety of note, ran over the 
whole gamut of cadence. In his verse the caesura 
flies from syllable to syllable as the foam leaps from 
crest to crest, and beckons the waves to follow in 
pliant but irresistible change. Consider the differ- 
ence between this word of Coriolanus : 

" When, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I 
Flattered their Volsces in Cortoli," 

where the whirling sweep of the first nine syllables 
suddenly checks itself at the tenth, and then, poised 
there a moment, actually vibrates as the sense de- 
mands ; consider the difference between this and 
the slow pulsing syllables and ebbing echoes of 
Prospero's great speech: 

" Oar revels now are ended ; these onr actors, 

Aa I foretold joa, are all spirits, and 

Hare melted into air, into thin air." 

After the molten speech of Marlowe, and Shake- 
speare's living rhythms, there was nothing for Mil- 
ton to do but to make blank verse architectural — 
to build it up into magnificent edifices of symmet- 
rical art. It may be said to have solidified in his 
hands ; and the business of later poets has been to 
try to bring back to it the play and changeableness 
of life. Wordsworth in his best verse imparted to 
it a spiritual transparency, almost transfiguration ; 
and there is a nameless necromancy in Shelley's 
" Alastor." But Keats alone was a spirit vivid and 
real enough to renew its former potency. Beside 
" Hyperion " I would place Landor's " Grebir " and 
Home's " Orion " as the best examples of modern 
blank verse. Arnold's two studies are noble in 
theme and treatment, but he had not the metrical 
ease and mastery for this most difiBcult form of 
poetry ; and Tennyson's blank verse is so mannered, 
and so full of mere prettiness. that I for one would 
never rank it with the work of the masters.

A Century's Retrospect." 



It is a little carioas that the author of the 
well-kDown watchword which tells us, among 
other things, to look forward and not back, 
should himself be so given to the retrospective 
and reminiscent, and so inclined to regret that 
the present generation has eyes only for the 
future. Yet nobody can feel in the least dis- 
posed to censure this seeming inconsistency, 
since to it we owe more than one most enjoy- 
able volume of memoirs. 

Whatever the value of " Memories of a Hun- 
dred Years " as a contribution to nineteenth- 
century history, it is as a human document 
that the book chiefly appeals to the reader ; the 
writer's own personality lends it its peculiar 
interest and charm. Therefore the reviewer 
prefers to treat it by no means as formal history, 
or even as autobiography, but rather as the note- 
book of one who has touched life at countless 
points, but who is too engrossed in good works 
to spare time for a very full, careful, or con- 
nected account of bis manifold experiences. 
That these memories cover not merely a hun- 
dred years, but go back almost half a century 
further, to Braddock's defeat, would cause nat- 
ural surprise if the explanation did not at once 
suggest itself that the remembering is done in 
large part by proxy. Thus almost the entire 
first volume deals with events that occurred 
either before the author was born, or before he 
was of an age to have any memories of his own. 
His remembrance, however, reaches back al- 
most to the cradle — to Lafayette's visit in 
1825, when the three-years-old boy was held up 
at the window to see the French patriot pass. 
Even before that time, and so early that he can- 
not now recall the circumstances, he had learned 
to read, probably at the dame school to which he 
was sent at his own clamorous request before 
the age of three. At twelve years of age he ap- 
peared in print in his father's " Boston Adver- 
tiser," and from that time on wrote more and 
more for the press. That he went to the Latin 
school and to Harvard College was in the usual 
order for a Boston lad of good family. His 
reporting at Cambridge at six o'clock in the 
morning for a thirteen-hour day of entrance 
examinations, gives us a picture of strenuous 
educational methods that contrast somewhat

ludiorously with the modest high-school curri- 
culum of the Harvard of that time. 

Refusing to " harass " his readers with many 
autobiographical details, Dr. Hale affords us 
only fleeting glimpses of himself in the storm- 
and-stress period of early manhood and in the 
busy years of a crowded career of public use- 
fulness. Some of these glimpses can best be 
given here in his own words, in such brief ex- 
tracts as space will permit. Emerson's cousin 
George had read some of his college prepara- 
tory Greek with Mr. Hale (who served a short 
apprenticeship at teaching in the Latin School), 
and had gratified his tutor by attaining high 
rank in his class at Harvard. Speaking of the 
Junior Exhibition, in which George had the 
first part, the author says : 

" After the whole was over, and as the assembly broke 
up, I crossed the chapel that I might speak to Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, who stood alone, as it happened, under 
the gallery. I introduced myself to him, and I said I 
wanted to congratulate him on the success of his cousin. 
He said: 'Yes, I did not know I had so fine a young 
cousin. And now, if something will fall out amiss, — if 
he should be unpopular with his class, or if his father 
should fail, or if some other misfortune can befall him, 
— all will be well.' I was indignant with what I called 
the cynicism of his speech. I thought it the afiectation 
of the new philosopher who felt that he must say some- 
thing out of the way of common congratulation. But I 
learned afterward, what he had learned then, that ■ good 
is a good master, but bad is a better.' And I do not doubt 
now that the remark, which seemed cynical, was most 
affectionate." 

The Hale and the Webster families were 
intimate. On young Mr. Hale's first visit to 
Washington he called on Mr. Webster, who 
was then Secretary of State. He recounts this 
experience, even at his own expense. 

" I have never forgotten the ease and simplicity with 
which, at dinner, he kept the conversation on such things 
as would interest a person who had just before been en- 
gaged in teaching. He went back to speak of his old 
days as a schoolmaster, when, once or twice, my father 
had taken his place. I had spoken of my interest in 
botany, and he began talking about Linnseus's letters, 
with which he was quite familiar, and from which he 
cited curious things. I, alas! had never seen Linn.neus's 
letters. Then because I had been a master in the Latin 
School, he brought the couversatiou round to Thirlwall's 
' History of Greece,' which he had read with interest. 
Alas! I had never read Thirlwall's ' History of Greece.' 
I do not think that there was the least wish to over- 
power a youngster in this; it was merely the ease with 
which he adapted himself to the man whom he was 
meeting." 

An amusing Webster anecdote, not one of 
Dr. Hale's personal recollections, but well au- 
thenticated, is given by him. Young Edward 
Everett Webster, with whom the author was 
intimate in school and college, was taken when 



a child by his mother to hear one of his father's 
speeches. They sat in the gallery. In the 
course of his address Mr. Webster cried out, 
in his most vigorous way, " Will any man dare 
say " — when his infant son, impressed with the 
folly of any such supposed case of audacity in 
contradicting his father, promptly responded 
from the gallery, " No, pa ! " 

Dr. Hale's admiration for Webster goes so 
far as to make him regard Mr. McCall's Dart- 
mouth address as a justification of the seven th- 
of-March speech. He further tells us with 
great emphasis that though he saw Webster 
in the last twenty-six years of the latter's life 
" thousands of times," and read " thousands of 
letters" from him, and visited the family he 
knows not how often, he never had a dream or 
thought that the great statesman cared any- 
thing for alcoholic stimulants. Dr. Hale's 
father, also, who survived Webster twelve 
years, "heard such stories as these with perfect 
disgust and indignation." Such testimony is 
not lightly to be put aside. Yet in marked 
contrast with it are the reminiscences of another 
octogenarian, who is no less ardent in his ad- 
miration. " I once saw him," says Dr. Cuyler 
in his recent book, " when his imperial brain 
was raked with the chain-shot of alcohol. The 
sight moved me to tears, and made me hate 
more than ever the accursed drink that, like 
death, is no 'respecter of persons.'" 

Young Mr. Hale enjoyed the warm friend- 
ship of his distinguished uncle, Edward Ever- 
ett. Of his valuable reminiscences of this 
accomplished man, there is here room for but 
one. 

"He said to me one day in the spring of 1846 that 
it was already long enough, since his return from 
Europe, for him to satisfy himself that the stately ora- 
tion of twenty years before was for America a thing of 
the past. He advised me as a young man to accustom 
myself to speak to large or small audiences without a 
manuscript before me, to accept the more colloquial 
habit, which I think he would have called the ' habit of 
the stump.' " 

"About the same time," the author adds in 
a footnote, " Orville Dewey told me how to do 
it. I think it was he who told me always to 
speak in public ' whenever any one was fool 
enough to ask me.' " 

Among the anecdotes given at second hand, 
the following about General Andrew Jackson 
is characteristic: 

" The daughter of a Massachusetts Senator told me 
that in her younger life she went with her father to one 
of the regulation dinners at the White House. General 
.Jackson himself took her out to the dinner-table. There 
was some talk about the light of the table, and the

General said to her, ' The chanticleer does not burn 
well.' She was so determined that she shoald not mis- 
understand him that she pretended not to hear him and 
asked him what he said. To which his distinct reply 
was, ' The chanticleer does not burn well.' " 

These are merely a few crumbs from the 
feast that awaits the reader who is not so ill- 
advised as to content himself with such scanty 
nibbles. That Dr. Hale everywhere shows the 
courage of his convictions, not to say also of 
his prejudices, is a matter of course. His 
vigorous optimism finds no use for certain "pes- 
simistic New York weeklies." To his staunch 
Republicanism Thomas Jefferson " fills the 
place in history which a fussy and foolish nurse 
fills in the biography of a man like Franklin, 
or Washington, or Goethe, or Julius Caesar." 
His sturdy common sense speaks out in that 
*' disgust for the mechanism of the public 
schools" which he says he takes occasion to 
express upon all suitable opportunities. Three 
months' time is enough, in his opinion, to de- 
vote to college preparatory Greek, for such as 
really wish to master it. The dulness of the 
new school of history comes in for a word of 
censure in his defense of his old friend Ban- 
croft. '* According to me," he declares, " you 
misrbt as well write with white ink on white 
paper as write anything in a language so dull 
that nobody wants to read it." 

He speaks of his iron memory, and indeed 
it is a most wonderful memory. But as rules 
are proved by their exceptions, perhaps he will 
permit the reviewer to heighten the effect of 
these marvels of recollection by placing in con- 
trast with them one or two apparent lapses. 
Referring to Williams College, from which 
his father, Nathan Hale, was graduated in 
1804, he says, " Dr. Tyler, the historian of the 
College, speaks of the four years after 1801 
as if they were unsatisfactory." Dr. William 
Seymour Tyler is well known as the historian 
of Amherst College. Is there a Dr. Tyler, 
historian of Williams ? Calvin Durfee, in his 
history of Williams College, describes the years 
immediately preceding 1804 as singularly pros- 
perous, and quotes in corroboration passages 
from President Fitch's letters of 1801-1804. 
The dark days of the college fell in 1819, 
when it came within a little of being trans- 
planted to Northampton. 

Defending Lowell from the foolish charge 
of indolence, Dr. Hale writes, " In his after 
life he speaks somewhere of his working fifteen 
hours a day, when at the same time editor of the 
North American Review and of the Atlantic 



Monthly." Is there not a mistake here? Un- 
less there is a surprising unanimity of error in 
the records, Lowell's own letters included, he 
held the editorship of the "Atlantic" from 1857 
to 1862, and with Professor Norton the joint 
editorship of the " North American Review " 
from 1863 to 1872. Possibly the simultaneity 
of office in our author's mind was that of the 
Harvard professorship and the magazine edi- 
torship. 

One more petty criticism, and we have done. 
Every one has heard of the committee-man 
who, when invited to address the school he was 
visiting, edified the young people before him 
with a lecture on the importance of "kerect 
pronounceation." Emphasizing the value of a 
good education, especially in English, Dr. Hale 
writes — or at least we read in his printed page: 
" And no matter who the kings asked to meet 
them, John Adams meant that the sons and 
daughters of Massachusetts should be able to 
hold their own in conversation . . . that they 
should speak English and understand English 
as well as any man in any place." The re- 
viewer, it is hoped, will be pardoned for taking 
note of what in any other connection would 
not have offered so irresistible a temptation. 
Besides, who knows whether some middle-man, 
— amanuensis, compositor, or proof-reader, — 
may not really be responsible for this slight de- 
parture from Lindley Murray ? 

Some new matter, both in text and footnotes, 
and in portraits, illustrations, and facsimiles, 
appears to have been added to the original 
chapters since their appearance in the " Out- 
look." But the great excellence of the book, 
and at the same time its great defect, lies in 
its suggestion of rich hoards of material un- 
used for lack of space. Many phases of the 
writer's abounding personality, many of his in- 
numerable forms of beneficent activity, receive 
no illustration whatever, so that in closing these 
volumes one is almost as ready to quarrel with 
the author because of what he has omitted, as 
to thank him for what he has included. But 
as to matter included, most readers will regret 
that so much space has been devoted to pre- 
natal recollections, so to speak, at the expense 
of later and to them more interesting matters. 
The excision of twenty pages on Philip Nolan, 
the Texas adventurer of 1801, would not have 
caused poignant grief. So, too, for Fulton and 
his steamboat we might well have been referred 
to the encyclopaedia, and treated instead to a 
dozen pages describing, let us say, the fortunes 
of the lat« lamented " Old and New," or the

author's visits to Europe and interviews with 
Martineau, Dean Stanley, and a score of others. 
But enough of this, or some one will be moved 
to retort, in Charles Lamb's familiar words: 
" It is a secret well known to the professors of 
the art and mystery of criticism, to insist upon 
what they do not find in a man's works, and to 
pass over in silence what they do."

"Varieties oe Religious Experience.* 



The value of a book to its reader depends 
upon what he can get out of it. To some, the 
volume now reviewed will appear as a brutal 
treatment of sacred things by a man who does 
not know what religion means. To others, it 
will seem an absurdly solemn discussion of 
matters which are foolish at the best, and often 
idiotic. To the present writer it seems a work 
of genius, admirable alike for the thoughts ex- 
pressed and the manner of their expression. 

The book does not concern itself with relig- 
ious institutions, nor with theologies ; but with 
the religious feelings and impulses of individ- 
uals. In these latter are found the true origin 
of religion, that inward and spiritual grace of 
which the churches are at best a secondary out- 
come. Professor James quotes at length the 
autobiographical records of numerous religious 
persons, belonging to various sects ; and of 
others not professedly religious, whose expe- 
riences are considered similar in kind. The 
number and fulness of these quotations may 
weary some readers, but anyone who will read 
them through will be convinced of the essential 
similarity of almost all the cases, notwithstand- 
ing wide differences in detail. This similarity 
depends upon the consciousness of communion 
or unity with a spiritual being of a higher type, 
— in ordinary language, with God. 

In order to get the clearest possible insight 
into the phenomena, the instances chosen for 
study are mostly those of the more extreme 
sort: those which modern science would usually 
class as psychopathological. Professor James 
urges that this should not deter us from re- 
garding them seriously. In the first place, the 
origin of spiritual experiences may be what you 
please ; but this does not affect their impor- 
tance and significance for us. If they mean

York : Longmans, Qreen, <& Co. 



much for the development of mankind, no med- 
ical materialism can rob them of their value. 
Even those who would class men of genius with 
the mentally deficient would not propose to 
dispense with the works of genius. Again, one 
sort of " origin " does not necessarily preclude 
another. If a man is " converted " because of a 
certain psychopathological condition, it does not 
follow that that condition may not have been the 
very thing which permitted the influx of some 
external spiritual force. Glass is said to be red 
when it transmits red light ; but who would be 
so absurd as to affirm that red light is solely 
caused — or, in fact, caused at all — by red 
glass ? The narrow materialist, who thinks he 
has explained religious experiences by refer- 
ring them to certain changes in the brain, is no 
more scientific than he who should consider red 
light a property of glass, ignoring the existence 
of the sun. 

Very interesting is the discussion of the 
" once-born " and " twice-born " types of man- 
kind. The " once-born " are those happy indi- 
viduals who are so simply constituted that they 
have no internal struggle, no sense of the bad- 
ness of things. They seem to sing a perpetual 
song to God, a psalm of gladness for the beauty 
of the world and the harmony they feel with 
it. Evil they repudiate and ignore. They are 
like those animals which flourish by the choice 
of suitable environment, avoiding instead of 
overcoming their enemies. Physically speak- 
ing, such persons may lead active militant 
lives, but they simply do not know what spirit- 
ual evil is. In recent years, this mental attitude, 
described by Professor James as " Healthy- 
mindedness," has been specially cultivated by 
a sect. The doctrines of " Christian Science," 
apparently increasing in popularity, depend 
upon the assumption that evil may be evaded 
by ignoring it. It is even held that physical 
evils may to some extent be thus overcome; 
and Professor James believes that there is 
sufficient proof to confirm this view. Indeed, 
orthodox medical men have long been aware 
of the value of " suggestion " as a therapeutic 
agent. 

The " twice-born " are those who have to 
struggle with evil in order to overcome it. They 
are those whose personality is complex, with 
antagonistic elements. Only after a prolonged 
conflict are they permitted to enter the haven 
of peace, by the triumph of the higher elements 
of their character; or, as it seems to them, by 
the direct influx of the Holy Ghost. Such per- 
sons have come too closely in contact with evil

ever to forget its existence. To the " once- 
born " they appear morbid, while to them the 
former seem shallowness itself. In considering 
the phenomena of conversion, whereby the 
" second birth " occurs, it is remarked that it 
is very commonly sadden, but nevertheless per- 
manent. As the author says, it is like the sud- 
den crystalizing out of a salt in a saturated 
solution, upon the addition of a solid object. 
Psychologically, Professor James explains this 
by suggesting that in reality a change has been 
going on in the subconscious regions of the 
mind, until it reaches a point when the equi- 
librium is disturbed, so to speak, and a new 
and stable position is assumed. It is impossible 
here to give all the reasons for this opinion ; 
but the reader of the book, if not unduly biased, 
will probably find them convincing. One inter- 
esting fact is that the change often occurs after 
the individual has given up the struggle; that 
is, after the ordinary mental faculties have 
become exhausted. Then, it seems, the subcon- 
scious self is able to assert itself and take pos- 
session of the field. In minor matters, such as 
the attempt to recollect a name, the same sort 
of thing may occur. The present writer has 
long known his indebtedness to the inspirations 
of leisure moments, and has long been con- 
vinced that the restless life is a relatively stupid 
one. It is probable that our crowded school 
curricula do irretrievable harm by not permit- 
ting time for those restful mental periods 
wherein the subconscious self tells the things 
that it has learned. 

So much for the psychological theory ; it 
remains to be asked, to what is the subconscious 
self indebted for the things it knows ? Obvi- 
ously, it is often indebted to the world of our 
ordinary knowledge, just as is our ordinary 
consciousness. I suppose everyone has had the 
experience of remembering something which 
was not consciously noticed originally ; which 
was seen out of the corner of the mind, so to 
speak, and did not come into the field of clear 
vision. Nevertheless, religious converts are 
convinced that t}itir knowledge did not come 
in this way, but was received from a higher 
spiritual source. Professor James holds that 
this cannot be definitely affirmed, from an out- 
sider's point of view, but is to be classed as 
an " over - belief." In an eloquent passage 
(p. 519), the author thus states his personal 
" over-belief " : 

"What the more characteristicallj divine facts are, 
apart from the actual inflow of energr in the faith-state 
and the prajer-state, I know not. But the over-belief 



on which I am ready to make my personal ventore i> 
that they exist The whole drift of my edaMtkw goe» 
to persuade me that the world of onr pi uwat (JuaauMiu 
ness is onlv one out of many worlds of consdousness thai 
exist, and that those other worlds must contain experi- 
ences which have a meaning for our life also; and that 
although, in the main, their experienoes and those of 
this world keep discrete, yet the two become continnoas 
at certain points, and higher energies filter in. By 
being faithful in my poor measure to this over-belief, 
I seem to myself to keep more sane and true. I can, 
of course, put myself into the sectarian scientist's atti- 
tude, and imagine vividly that the world of sensations 
and of scientific laws and objects may be all. But 
whenever I do this, I hear that inward monitor, of whiefa 
W. K. Clifford once wrote, whispering the word 'bosh!' 
Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the scientifie 
name; and the total expression of human experience, 
as I view it objectively, invincibly urges me beyond 
the narrow 'scientific' bounds. Assuredly, the real 
world is of a different temperament, — more intricately 
built than physical science allows. So my objective and 
mv subjective conscience both hold me to the over- 
belief which I express. Who knows whether the faith- 
fulness of individuals here below to their own poor 
over-beliefs may not actually help God in torn to be 
more effectively faithful to his own greater tasks ? " 

With this wholly inadequate notice we must 
leave what seems to the reviewer one of the 
great books of our time.

The Deax of Amkricax Lettkks.* 



Some forty years ago James Russell Lowell 
wished to introduce to the Boston world of let- 
ters a young man who had followed his poems 
from Ohio. He therefore made a dinner for 
him at Parker's at which the other guests were 
Oliver Wendell Holmes and Mr. James T. 
Fields. "Well, James," said the autocrat, 
" this is something like the apostolic succession : 
this is the laying on of hands." He was right, 
for Mr. Howells not only succeeded Lowell a» 
editor of the " Atlantic," bn* in other and lar- 
ger ways. -^ 

I have several times (in somewhat academic 
fashion perhaps) considered Irving and Lowell 
as the representative men of letters of their 
times. Each was undoubtedly the chief man 
of letters of his day (if we can regard the man 
of letters as something a little different from 
poet, novelist, historian, or any other specific 
kind of author), and each was typical of the lit- 
erary spirit of his time. Irving represents the 
first period of our literary activity and Lowell

[Nov. 16, 



the second. I can think of no one more prop- 
erly representative of the later phases of our 
national literary life than Mr. Howells. 

It is not as being necessarily the greatest 
genius of his time, that Mr. Howells is entitled 
to this distinction. Neither Irving nor Lowell 
was exactly the greatest genius of his time. 
Measurements of genius are misleading and 
dangerous : only in cases of immense preemi- 
nence can we be quite sure of our reckonings. 
But putting such dangerous questions aside, 
Mr. Howells, like Irving and Lowell, is for 
other reasons more a representative man than 
any of his contemporaries. For one thing he 
is more a master in his profession than any- 
body else: he understands the whole range of 
letters more thoroughly. Irving and Lowell 
were also masters of easy power in a broad 
range of letters, but I am not sure that Mr. 
Howells does not surpass them. Not merely 
fiction is his field, the natural and necessary 
mode of expression of our day, but poetry, 
criticism, essay, drama, as well. Like Gold- 
smith, there are few veins that he has not 
worked, and wherever he has worked he has 
brought forth gold. 

But further also, Mr. Howells is representa- 
tive of his time ; he is entirely in the spirit of 
it. It is true that of late years, everyone sees 
that the spirit of the time, so far as letters is 
concerned, is changing ; but however that may 
be, the last third of the century will historically 
be the time of the influence of realism in fiction 
and the drama, a movement in which Mr. 
Howells was our chief leader. And however 
technical principles of realism may have changed 
or may be changing, there can be little doubt 
that the increased seriousness which it brought, 
the more pervading consciousness of the neces- 
sary close relation between literature and life, 
the feeling that literature should in some meas- 
ure and with varying means interpret life, 
this, the necessary feeling of the realist, will 
not pass away as readily as the formulas of 
local color and states of soul. And in that 
respect, too, Mr. Howells is a great represen- 
tative figure. 

We may therefore look at his last collection 
of essays and studies with singular interest. It 
is not to be regarded as a suitor for favor : it 
must be looked upon rather as the record of a 
fact. We may like it or not, according to our 
taste : doubtless, there is little of the future in 
it, more of the past ; but we naturally find in 
it a claim on the attention of everyone who 



likes to feel that he understands the movements 
and tendencies in the culture of his day. 

The different papers that make up the book 
were probably not written with especial refer- 
ence to each other. They did, on the other 
hand, have always the inspiration of a common 
feeling, and this feeling is so characteristic of 
Mr. Howells that it makes the book more 
notable (as well as more charming) than it 
would be without. He speaks of it in " A Word 
of Explanation." Doubtless all that is there 
said has been otherwise said already by him- 
self, or by others under the same feelings as 
himself. But I will own that a word or two 
makes clearer to me than it was, the spirit in 
which Mr. Howells has worked, — perhaps the 
prevailing spirit of that influence of which he 
was our chief spokesman. He writes : 

" I have never been able to see much difference be- 
tween what seemed to me Literature and what seemed 
to me Life. . . . Unless the thing seen reveals to me an 
intrinsic poetry, and puts on phrases that clothe it pleas- 
ingly to the imagination, I do not much care for it; but 
if it will do this, I do not mind how poor or common 
or squalid it shows at first glance; it challenges my 
curiosity and keeps my sympathy." 

" The union of Literature and Life," he after- 
ward says, " is the rainbow in the sky for me ; 
and I have seldom seen a sky without some bit 
of rainbow in it." 

This, it seems to me, makes one understand 
the realist position better. How different it 
is from the view of another man who unfortu- 
nately did not live to enjoy many years of the 
admiration and love that we feel for Mr. 
Howells. Stevenson would never have said 
that. He saw lovely things in Life and in Liter- 
ature, but the sky for him was surely often 
without the rainbow, and he was often forced to 
recall some lovely rainbow he had seen before, 
or imagine a lovely one that he would see. As 
to which way is the best way to the pot of gold 
at the foot may be doubtful. 

Intrinsically the papers of this collection 
have their specific interest in subject as well 
as in handling. Perhaps a half are of those 
impressions of travel, wherein Mr. Howells 
is so much at home, though geographically the 
traveller has often strayed no farther than the 
New England coast. Some of them are more 
destructively critical papers. And a good many 
are practically professional, if informal, opin- 
ions and ideas, not exactly on literature or on 
life, but on literary life, — a matter on which 
Mr. Howells is as well informed as anyone. 
These have for me more interest than the

The Scotch and Irish in America.* 



The Scotch-Irish Society of America was 
formed at Columbia, Tennessee, in 1889, in 
connection with a congress assembled at the 
suggestion of Mr. Thomas T. Wright of 
Florida, to organize for the perpetuation of 
the achievements and the preservation of the 
history of the Scotch-Irish race in America. 
The society aroused a great deal of enthusiasm 
and held successful annual meetings in several 
different cities. On these occasions papers were 
presented and addresses were made which dis- 
cussed various phases of our country's history 
as illustrating the position taken by Scotch- 
Irish Americans. The papers were subsequently 
published in nine volumes, and much good 
material for history was thus gathered. The 
papers presented were not uniform in merit, 
some of them being congratulatory and boast- 
ful in tone, with much looseness of statement ; 
others were carefully prepared and filled with 
matter of historic value. But two things were 
clearly evident as a result of these meetings, — 
first, that the enthusiastic Scotch-Irish were 
disposed to make rash claims for their race 
representatives; and, second, that American 
historians bad not paid enongh attention to 
the part played in our early colonial life by 
the Scotch-Irish, Huguenot, and other non- 
English elements of our always cosmopolitan 
population. 

The last twenty years have witnessed a sur- 
prising interest in American colonial history. 
This has resulted in a great output of books, 
dealing with every possible phase of colonial 
life, military, political, economic, and social. 
All sorts of societies have published records 
and papers, and neglected heroes and forgotten 
facts have been dragged to light out of many 
a nook and corner. But there is still oppor- 
tunity for some one to present in approved

form, without needless padding and without 
untrustworthy enthusiasm, a readable history 
of each of the minor race-elements which com- 
bined to form the American population at the 
beginning of our national era. 

The early announcements seemed to indicate 
that Mr. Charles A. Hanna was to be the his- 
torian of the Scotch-Irish in America. There 
was a lot of unassorted material in the records 
of the Scotch-Irish congress and elsewhere, 
and, ej;pecially, many a hint as to desirable and 
available sources. There was both a splendid 
theme and an awaiting constituency. The re- 
sult of Mr. Hanna's labors is distinctly dis- 
appointing. " The Scotch-Irish," or as the 
secondary title reads, " The Scot in North 
Britain, North Ireland, and North America," 
is not a history : it is an aggregation of ma- 
terials. The running title is "The Sootch- 
Irish Families of America." but five hundred 
of the six hundred pages in the first volume are 
taken up with Scotch history and Scotch char- 
acteristics, leading up very gradually to the 
migration from Ulster to America. Five-sixths 
of the second volume, likewise, are given up to 
appendices containing a surprising amount of 
material, thousands of names being presented 
in all sorts of lists connected with Scotch and 
Scotch-American history, all of these collec- 
tions evidencing a vast amount of labor of love. 
The special chapters bearing particularly upon 
the Scotch-Irish in America are illogical in 
arrangement, and are marred by the boastful 
tendency already mentioned. There are some 
valuable features, such as a map with descrip- 
tive notes showing the location of the Scoteh- 
Irish settlements ; and twenty pages of bibliog- 
raphy give some notion of the literature to 
be examined by one who would make himself 
thoroughly familiar with the subject of Scotch 
influence on American life. It is only fair to 
Mr. Hanna to say that he himself recognizes 
his own failure to make a history, and to ac- 
cord to him the justness of his claim to have 
gathered into his two handsome volumes valu- 
able materials, not otherwise easy of examin- 
ation, without which no one could write a 
history of this race. 

The name '"Scotch-Irish" is an American-

Myers takes early occasion to state that the 
" Irish " Quakers were really English, they too 
having tarried only temporarily in Ireland. 
In a volume of nearly five hundred pages of 
attractive typography and illustration he tells 
the tale of Irish Quaker immigration into Penn- 
sylvania during the years 16b2 to 1750. After 
a summary sketch of the rise of Quakerism in 
England and its transplantation into Ireland, 
the inducements to American migration are 
described, and the course of such migration 
marked out. The real addition to American 
race history comes in the designation of the 
places settled by these Irish Quakers, and in 
the collection of facts showing their character- 
istics and the varied features of their social 
life. One-half of the volume is given up to 
accounts of prominent Irish Friends and to 
genealogical matter, many hundreds of names 
being catalogued which show what an incre- 
ment of population America received from this 
particular element. Ten pages of bibliography 
of printed and manuscript sources are supplied, 
and an index of thirty pages completes a most 
pleasing specimen of book-making. There are 
tens of thousands of descendants of these Irish 
Quakers scattered throughout the Union who 
will find in this volume the story of their im- 
migrant ancestors. It is a real contribution 
to American race history, and a valuable addi- 
tion to the literature of colonial life.

The reader of " The Fortunes of Oliver Horn " 
closes its pages not so much with the sense of having 
read a symmetrical and well-rounded novel as with 
the feeling that he has had an hour or two of pleas- 
ant companionship with a group of delightful human 
beings. Construction has never been the strong 
point of the versatile Mr. Hopkinson Smith, and in 
the present instance he seems to have been less con- 
cerned with it than ever. He has given us instead 
a copious outpouring of genial reminiscence — so-

student in New York, and the reckless sort of 
bohemianism which is ever attractive to the young, 
bat which quickly palls upon the sense. In his 
handling of the acutely controversial period of the 
Civil War, Mr. Smith is not wholly the apologist 
for the Southern view, and he realizes that the South 
in those days was swept by an epidemic of some- 
thing like emotional insanity ; but while his intel- 
lect recognizes the virtue of the Northern temper, 
his heart remains with the society of his boyhood.. 
We cannot well blame him for this — surely not if 
life in the Old Dominion was anything like as 
charming in its human development as he pictures 
it. Indeed, one of the chief questions raised by 
this book — as well as by several others that we have 
had of recent years — is the question whether there 
is to be found anywhere in America to-day as fine 
a type of character and social environment as that 
which existed in the South during the first half of 
the century, and was forever swept away by the 
stormy sixties. If, in making our modern life more 
strenuous and purposeful, we have lost our feeling 
for its finer graces, the satisfaction of the thinking 
man must remain somewhat qualified, although he 
may recognize that the transformation was inev- 
itable. 

" Captain Macklin " is a story of adventure in 
a Central American Republic. The hero is sprung 
from several generations of soldiers, and becomes a 
West Pointer as a matter of course. Unfortunately 
the discipline of the institution makes a victim of 
him, and he is dismissed in disgrace for a violation 
of orders. Determined to be a soldier somewhere, 
he consults the newspapers, discovers that a revo> 
lution is going on in Honduras, and forthwith sets 
out to offer his sword to the insurgents. He is- 
made a captain on the spot, performs prodigies of 
valor, bears a charmed life amid storms of bullets, 
and leads his men in triumph to the capital. The 
triumph is short-lived, for the revolutionists are 
betrayed, and depart with an ignominy at least 
equal to the glory of their entry. Then the hero 
returns to the bosom of his family in New York to 
think it all over. At the close of the book he learns 
of more fighting in Egypt, and sets out for new 
scenes and victories, leaving the reader in breathless 
but unrewarded anticipation. This seems to promise 
a farther section of the " Memoirs " of this doughty 
youth, for the author cannot be so unkind as to 
leave us in the dark concerning the Egyptian cam- 
paign. Captain Macklin is not altogether a satis-

factory hero ; he U too much of a vain-glorioas 
blasterer and braggart to appeal to a nice Bense 
of the heroic. Bat boys will like to read of his 
exploits, and many men are boyish enough to take 
a sneaking sort of satisfaction in a story that is 
told with so much nervous energy, and is so replete 
with stirring incidents. Indeed, the irrepressible 
boyishness of the whole performance is its chief 
characteristic. 

" The Life of a Woman," by Mr. R. V. Risley, 
is a story upon that not anusual theme, an ill- 
assorted marriage. The heroine is a young woman 
who has yearnings, which she expresses in ungram- 
matical language. She does not seem to know just 
what she wants, but she abhors the thought of a 
commonplace existence. Having married a sensible 
but somewhat stolid man of basiness, she discovers 
that life has grown dull. Her existence is simply 
bourgeois and she would like to make it bohemian. 
When children appear, her husband very properly 
decides that the city is no place in which to rear 
them, and, taking it for granted that she will un- 
derstand so plain a matter, purchases a charming 
suburban home for his family. But life in a suburb 
means nothing more to her than the daily round of 
unpleasant duties and the penance of neighborhood 
gossip. She has absolutely no inner resources, and 
is miserable. She longs for the excitements of an 
artificial society, and even envies the lot of the girl- 
hood friend who is living in Paris as an artist's 
mistress. Her husband is much too good for her, 
although, being human, he once so far forgets himself 
as to swear in her presence. The outcome of this 
situation is not. however, what the seasoned reader 
of novels expects. Instead of breaking away in 
revolt, the wife slowly becomes subdued to her en- 
vironment, and we are left with the impression that 
she is the victim of tragic circumstance. At last, 
this is the impression that the author intends to 
leave, for his story is based upon a morbid concep- 
tion of human rights and duties. He clearly exp>ect8 
us to sympathize with the woman, whereas a sane 
view of the whole situation would rather prove 
provocative of sympathy for the husband, and of 
exasperation with the wife. The book as a whole 
is amateurish in design and crude in execution ; it 
is the product of a narrow and unbalanced view of 
life, which ignores the great principle of reaping as 
we have sown, and has no other ideal than that of 
mere hedonism. 

Mr. Booth Tarkington's novel of the Mexican 
War period tells a love-story in terms of delicate 
old-fashioned sentiment. The scene is somewhere 
in the Ohio valley. Southern Ohio or Indiana — 
and the characters are studied with sympathy. The 
scheme of the novel is extremely artificial, and is 
based upon a perfectly impossible complication. 
There is only one Vanrevel in fact, but the heroine 
gets the notion that the name belongs to his friend 
and law partner Crailey Gray. Throughout the 
book sbe supposes each of these gentlemen to be the 
other, which leads to much silent suffering on the 



part of Vanrevel, and to the tragic bat deserved 
death of Gray. The hero is altogether too qaizotie 
in his devotion to the friend who encourages the 
deception for his own selfish purposes. Even when 
Gray's contemptible duplicity comes to light. Van- 
revel's one thought is to shield his friend and con- 
tinue to suffer the consequences of the fatal misun- 
derstanding. It is all cleared up at the end, of 
course, and the hero starts for Mexico with the 
knowledge that he has won the love of the heroine. 
Her brute of a father is particularly unconvincing, 
and there is a trick of artificiality about several of 
the other characters ; but the story is prettily told, 
and its tension is relieved by an occasional touch 
of comedy. 

The final conquest for civiliuttion of the Ohio 
Valley has offered several recent writers of historical 
fiction an attractive theme. Mr. Altsheler's novel 
is probably the best treatment that the subject has 
thus far received, but it is possible to say a very 
good word for " The Heritage," just published by 
Mr. Burton Egbert Stevenson. This story begins 
in Virginia in Revolutionary days, daring the boy- 
hood of the hero. He grows up just in time to be 
fired with enthasiasm for the pioneer movement 
toward the Ohio, and becomes an actor in the strug- 
gle that leads, through the defeat of Harmer and 
St. Clair, to the final victory of Wayne. The story 
has a good deal of Indian fighting, excellently told, 
and a vein of sentimental romance that affords a 
pleasant relief to its sterner episodes. 

In •• The Holland Wolves." by Mr. J. Breckin- 
ridge Ellis, we go back to the days of Spanish per- 
secution in the Netherlands and the inspiration of 
■' Beggar " patriotism. The noble figure of Egmont 
and the sinister figure of Alva occupy the centre of 
the stage as far as the characters of actual history 
are concerned, but the main interest of the romance 
is private and sentimental. There are some well- 
drawn figures of Dutchmen, and a rather stunning 
heroine in the person of a maiden (supposedly 
Spanish) who in male attire accompanies her puta- 
tive father to the wars. The hero is a wandering 
French Huguenot, a happy-go-lucky individual who 
is peculiarly susceptible to feminine charms, but 
hardly of the stuff that goes to the making of really 
acceptable heroes. The story is stilted in manner 
and far from satisfactory in construction. 

Mrs. Foote's latest novel, " The Desert and the 
Sown," takes us once more to the far Western re- 
gion which she knows so intimately, and of which 
she makes such admirable use as a setting for her 
stories. It is as a setting only, and for the pro- 
vision of color and atmosphere, since she never 
subordinates human interest to anything else. In 
this case, the interest attaches to a singular sitaa- 
tion indeed. The daughter of a wealthy farmer on 
the Hudson has eloped with one of her father's 
men, a gentle, devoted, but inefficient creature. 
Disowned by her family, they have settled in the 
far West, and there, after some years of hardship, 
her husband has disappeared one stormy night.

leaving it to be inferred that he has perished from 
exposure. When the story opens many years after- 
wards, the supposed widow, long in possession of 
the family wealth, and the mother of two grown-up 
children, is on a visit to a western military post. 
Her son is betrothed to the daughter of the com- 
mandant, and the wedding is soon to occur. He 
goes off for a few weeks with a camping party, and 
great peril overtakes them in the mountains. One 
of the guides is disabled, and the rest of the party, 
grown panic-stricken, seek their own safety by 
abandoning the guide to his fate. Paul alone, not 
being made of cowardly stuff, remains with the sick 
man. Days of fever and semi-starvation follow, 
and the guide, in his delirium, reveals the fact that 
be is Paul's father, and that his early desertion of 
his wife had resulted from the conviction that she 
would be better free. Paul has a hard struggle 
with himself before his better self triumph?, and he 
is prepared to admit the new-found relationship. 
After they have been found by the rescuing party, 
the same problem is offered to bis mother, but she 
hardens her heart, and shows no sign of recogni- 
tion. The father, too proud to betray himself to 
the injury of wife and children, disappears as soon 
as his strength is restored, and the remainder of 
the book is devoted to Paul's passionate quest for 
his rediscovery. The scene finally takes us to the 
old manor-house on the Hudson, and there the old 
vagrant, who has crawled to his boyhood home to 
die, is again confronted by his wife, who at last 
overcomes the pride and self-repression of a life- 
time, and reveals her secret. This story is told with 
marked power and subtlety of analysis ; its outlines 
are made severe and almost harsh through restraint 
in the use of rhetorical or picturesque ornament, 
but the effect is deeply impressive. 

Another story of the West, the scene being Ne- 
braska, is the work of Miss Elizabeth Higgins. 
It is called " Out of the West," and has nothing of 
the art or insight displayed by Mrs. Foote's novel, 
yet it contrives to be fairly interesting by virtue of 
its qualities of fresh observation, and faithfulness 
in matters of detail. It is the work of an amateur, 
and has many of those loose ends that the amateur 
never knows what to do with. Characters that 
promise well are introduced only to be dropped, 
and situations are left only half-developed. The 
latter part of the book takes us to Washington (the 
hero having become a Congressman), and consti- 
tutes the weakest part of the novel. The writer 
seems to be a sort of Populist, and her book will 
find favor among the discontented. 

Mrs. Craigie seems to delight in absurd titles for 
her stories, and " Love and the Soul Hunters" is but 
the last of a long series of similar indiscretions of 
nomenclature. It is strange that a writer whose style 
is so refined, and even distinguished, as hers, should 
not be able to find simpler and more natural names 
for her books. The present performance takes us 
into very fine society indeed. A queen dowager 
and a prince (temporarily dispossessed) are con- 



spicuous among the characters, and are placed in a 
setting wherein we mingle upon familiar terms with 
figures from la haute finance and the British nobil- 
ity, an American millionaire, and the former favor- 
ite of an emperor, known to the stage as La Belle 
Valentine. The prince is the hero, and he has for 
secretary an astute middle-aged German named 
Felshammer. Both prince and secretary seek the 
love of a certain young woman, and, the former 
being successful, the latter lies in ambush and shoots 
his master. Since the wound does not prove fatal, 
the secretary thinks he may as well tell his master 
all about it. " Do you expect to try it again ? " asks 
the prince. " No," replies the secretary. " Then 
I forgive you, but I would rather not see yon any 
more." We have read this novel with a certain 
degree of pleasure, for it has a well-constructed 
plot and is written in a style that few contemporary 
novelists can equal. But it is too much of an exotic 
to seem a genuine portrayal of human life, and its 
appeal is rather to an artificial than to a natural 
taste. 

The strongly marked Tendenz of "The Blood- 
Tax" will probably frighten some readers away 
from a very readable book. Miss Gerard knows 
the German military world of which she writes, 
and although her literary art is small, she has inter- 
esting matter and makes its expression convincing. 
The story is of an Englishman of affairs, who ac- 
cepts a post in a barracks town in Germany for the 
purpose of studying the military system on the spot. 
He believes that England's salvation lies in con- 
scription, and wishes to fortify himself for the 
propagation of this idea by a first hand observation 
of militarism in its chief Continental stronghold. 
Brought face to face with the German system, he 
perceives the evil concomitants which had escaped 
him at a distance, and returns home to advocate, 
not conscription, but a plan of education upon the 
military basis, calling for occasional periods of 
training, but not for the sacrifice of one or more 
years on the part of the individual. The plot of 
the story is based upon a complication so artificial 
that to any but German readers imbued with the false 
ideal of military honor it seems fairly incredible. 
The hero is a German dragoon who is disgraced 
and forced to resign his commission because when 
struck by a ruflSan in the dark he does not catch his 
assailant in time to administer the salutary correc- 
tion of a sword-thrust. The fellow is arrested by a 
policeman before the officer reaches the spot, and 
thus the opportunity of clearing his tarnished honor 
is forever lost. It sounds like a story from bur- 
lesque opera, but is sadly true to German military 
conditions. Every one of the officer's friends and 
associates agrees that resignation is the only course 
open to him to avoid the scandal of a dismissal in 
disgrace, and even the heroine weakens and gives 
him up — although we are led to suppose that she 
loves him passionately — when he comes to her for 
consolation, bat in civilian dress. It seems that the 
uniform rather than the man was what she had

eared for all the time. Od »och a heroine sympa- 
thy would be wasted, and she shall have none of 
onrs. This object lesson in the inward meaning 
of militarism is not lost upon the English observer, 
who leaves Germany quite cured of the notion 
that his own country should receive the German 
gospel. 

Mr. Pemberton's " The House ander the Sea " ia 
one of the author's most fantastic imaginings. As 
once before, he Ukes us to the remote Pacific, and 
we are made to contemplate a strange island fast- 
ness, the home of a gang of wreckers, whose captain 
has wooed and won a fair English maiden and 
brought her to this inaccessible spot She does not 
know the horrors of the life before her until it is 
too late to turn back. How she is eventually res- 
cued by a faithful sailor friend of her early days is 
the snbsUnce of the narrative. The story gets iu 
name from a curious subterranean or submarine re- 
treat to which the islanders repair when certain 
dangerous miasms make the air of the island pois- 
onous. The author does not balk at the wildest 
improbabilities, but he is sufficiently practiced in 
his art to keep them from seeming wholly incredi- 
ble, at least for the moment. 

From this romance to the romance of an actual 
mermaid the transition is natural, and a mermaid 
is the heroine of -The Sea Lady," which is the 
title of the latest contrivance of Mr. H. G. Wells. 
The mermaid is a charming creature of her kind, 
who wearies of a watery life, and determines to 
seek the society of humankind. So she bobs up one 
day in the midst of a bathing party, pretending to 
be a maiden in distress attacked by the cramps. 
This, considering her character, is a decidedly 
" fishy " story, but it serves its purpose. She is 
duly rescued, and only after she has been taken 
ashore by her new friends is the discovery made of 
her distinctive anatomy. Her rescuers are kind- 
hearted, and accede to her request to be allowed to 
live with them. She poses as an invalid, and is 
taken about in a chair, so arrayed as to conceal the 
distinctive mark of her race. Since the upper half 
of her is a beautiful young woman with golden 
hair, and since she is both intelligent and well read, 
she enjoys a pronounced social success. Her siren 
charms presently captivate the rising statesman who 
serves for a hero, and she lures him away from the 
serious young woman to whom he is betrothed. At 
last, he follows her to the sea, and together they 
plunge into the unknown. Mr. Wells carries off 
these difficult situations with his customary inge- 
nuity, and makes a story that is readable, if not 
exactly convincing. There is a good deal of quiet 
humor in the book, especially in its delineation of 
the serious young woman (who wants to be like one 
of Mrs. Humphry Ward's heroines), and its ac- 
eonnt of the way in which mermaids are supplied 
with the reading matter which keeps them informed 
about the ways of the upper world.

NOTES ON NOVELS. 

Mr. Will Payne was one of the first American writers 
to see the romantic possibilities of the modern world of 
commerce and fiQance, and in his literary work be has 
kept himself pretty clearly within that field. The col- 
leetioD of novelettes and short stories which make up 
his volume, " On Fortone's Road " (MeClarg), deal 
with banking, various forms of specalation in prodnoe 
aad stocks, with sordid commercial politics, and with 
manufacturing and labor unions. Into each is woven 
skilfully the deeper human interest of the affections, 
and all betrav an intimate acquaintance with the details 
of the business involved. One, " The Little Lame Boy," 
is especially tender and graceful, disclosing the suc- 
cessful man of affairs at the moment when he finds 
himself fairly shut out from the inner life of his wife 
and child, an unintentional but inevitable retribation 
for his own engrossment in his profession. Photo- 
graphic in its fidelity to city life to-day, Mr. Payne's 
work is literary in its snggestiveness and reserve. 

Egypt in the later days of the last century, almost a 
virgin field in fiction, finds delineation in Sir Gilbert 
Parker's " Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt " 
(Appleton). The titular hero is an Englishman in the 
service of Ismail the last Khedive, and bis trusted ad- 
viser because he is poor but honest and an inveterate 
teller of troth and interpreter of European sentiment. 
Though small of stature and almost gfirlish in appear- 
ance, Donovan is a mighty man of valor and resonrceful 
as a fox, extricating himself and his friends from the 
most hopeless of dilemmas. The volume closes with 
several tales of Tommy Atkins in Egyptian campaign- 
ing, Sir Gilbert greatly daring in depicting an Irishman 
in the ranks who is certain to provoke comparisons with 
the immortal Terence Mulvaoey. Episodic in its char- 
acter, the book is still one to be read, for information 
hardly less than for pleasure. 

Several years ago Mr. A. E. W. Mason wrote a short 
storv in which be painted a character, the son of a race 
of soldiers, who showed himself a coward in being afraid 
of cowardice, though at heart one of the bravest of the 
brave. It was a situation so striking and so vividly told 
that it must always linger in the memory of its readers. 
Now Mr. Mason has expanded this brief tale into a 
romance of fonr hundred pages, which he names " The 
Four Feathers" (Maemillan). The result is an inter- 
esting experiment in literary technique, and one which 
is in the main snoeessful. Here the hero resigns from 
the service just as his command is ordered to the front. 
Three of his brother officers detect the device, which 
was none too subtle at best. Returning to the girl to 
whom he is betrothed, the poor fellow receives a box 
containing three white feathers and the cards of bis 
soldier companions. The girl breaks the engagement 
to marrv, and adds the fourth feather. The rest of the 
book describes the exhibitions of calm and collected 
courage by which the lost estate and self-respect are 
restored, and has in addition a well-developed love 
story entwined with the one already mentioned. 

"The Diary of a Saint" (Houghton) is an unusual 
book, old-fashioned in its manner of telling the story 
through the device of a day-by-day journal, and highly 
idealized in the sonl of the good woman who writes 
it. She is liberal in her views concerning dogmatic 
religion, and is therefore held in reproach by many of 
her neighbors. But as suffering comes to these neigh- 
bors she plnckily helps them to bear their burdens,

taking almost more than she should in adopting the 
orphaned child of an unfortunate mother whom she 
nurses. She appears at the beginning of the diary as 
engaged to a young man who had her dead father's 
entire approval; but she voluntarily breaks the engage- 
ment when another woman's claims intervene. Much 
suffering came to her in the cumulative manner which 
is characteristic of suffering at times, but she finds 
strength to bear it all. The book is one of the best 
that Mr. Arlo Bates has written, showing an unex- 
pected knowledge of other than his customary fields. 

In " Doctor Bryson " (Scribner), Mr. Frank H. 
Spearman has depicted the career of a modern oculist, 
quite at the head of his profession in the city of Chicago. 
He falls in love with a wife whose selfish husband 
abandoned her, long before the story opens, when her 
father's failure deprived her of the wealth he had mar- 
ried her for. This lady's little daughter has suffered 
a serious accident to one of her eyes, and it is through 
this circumstance that the man and woman come to- 
gether, though they are boarding in the same establish- 
ment. Necessarily, diseases of the eye occupy a fore- 
most place in the detail of the book, though it cannot 
be said that the profession of the oculist is any more 
prominent here than the profession of the soldier in 
stories of war or of the professional trickster in picar- 
esque romance. The story indeed is a faithful picture 
of a really important factor in modern life which has 
remained without fictional celebration until now. It is 
a complete change from Mr. Spearman's earlier tales 
of adventure in the railway service, and, though longer 
and better sustained than these, it is not their equal in 
treatment or interest. 

Miss Louise Forsslund has written a striking book 
in "The Ship of Dreams" (Harper), a story of the de- 
generate descendants of an aristocratic Long Island 
family, colonial in its origin. The sin of the heir to a 
great estate follows him and his descendants through 
life, carrying its terrible consequences into the life of a 
beautiful young girl, of gentle nature in spite of sordid 
and forbidding surroundings. The theme is worked 
out in elaborate detail, the characters are numerous 
and well defined, the scenes unusual and with an exotic 
flavor in spite of the locality, and the book as a whole 
striking and indicative of power. 

Mr. Jack London reaches down to the very bottom 
of the human heart in bis collection of short stories, 
dealing with the aborigines of Alaska, entitled " The 
Children of the Frost" (Macmillan). Most of these 
tales are written without reference to the white race, 
exhibiting the native tribes in the full possession of 
their own lands and lives. Mr. London is able to ana- 
lyze savage motives and methods, and the great primal 
forces swaying mankind stand bare but not repellent in 
his presentation. The other stories have to do with the 
coming of " civilization," and here the author's sym- 
pathy for the weaker men and women who are driven 
to the wall is quite the finest thing in the book, just as 
its inexorableness is the harshest. It is an unusual 
field that this young western writer has made his own, 
and his discoveries are of value. 

The Baroness von Hutten has for the principal figure 
in "Our Lady of the Beeches" (Houghton) a young 
American woman, married to an Hungarian noble with 
whose manner of life she is not in full accord. A letter 
written to an American essayist and man of science 
leads to a correspondence in which both parties conceal 
their identities. It chances that the man has a guide 



in the Maine woods who, as he discovers, is husband to 
the noblewoman's old nurse, and through this means the 
two are brought into contact under romantic and uncon- 
ventional conditions. Love is declared — and there the 
story ends. It is idyllic and replete with delicate senti- 
ment, varied by an intimate knowlege of the relations of 
the sexes and a wide acquaintance with the world. The 
book is unusual in many particulars, and full of literary 
flavor. 

The crude modernity which has flavored so mnch of 
Miss Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler's work is lacking to a 
degree in her "Fuel of Fire" (Dodd, Mead & Co.). 
In its stead is used an ancient superstition foretelling 
the downfall of a family the history of which goes back 
to mediaeval times. The story is entirely of the present 
day, except for the brief prologue, which declares that 
Baxendale Hall must be burned down thrice. Two- 
thirds of the prediction have been fulfilled at the open- 
ing of the story, which turns largely on the various 
suspicions attaching to the person who is supposed to 
have burnt it down — but on almost the last page, it 
turns out to be no person at all. There is a love story, 
wholly free from morbidity, running through the book. 

Mrs. Helen Choate Prince has written many novels 
which have displayed her mastery of English, but none 
of them shows the grasp upon human affairs of her 
latest, "The Strongest Master" (Houghton). It is the 
story of a living soul that sought redemption. The 
hero, a young man with everything in life before him, 
is expelled from Harvard for gambling, just as he is 
about to get his degree. He realizes to the full what 
a mistake his life has been, and sets his face toward 
reformation. Obtaining a situation in a factory, he 
comes to intimacy with a labor leader, a sentimentalist 
and idealist, as so many are. Not himself alone, but 
the entire world, comes into his plans for regeneration, 
and he suffers vicariously with the unfortunate and un- 
happy. Love comes to him then, and with it a clearer 
insight into actualities. With no abatement of his 
idealism, he finds a way to happiness and restoration to 
his father's affections at once. The book is an excellent 
one, and Mrs. Prince's own comprehension of the broader 
democracy of life not the least encouraging element 
in it. 

The Very Reverend Cyrus Townsend Brady has fore- 
gone bloodshed for a time in his writing, and his latest 
volume, " Woven with the Ship : A Novel of 1865 ; 
Together with Certain Other Veracious Tales of Various 
Sorts" (Lippincott), utilizes the navy for no more des- 
perate purpose than color and atmosphere. A little less 
than half of the finely-illustrated volume is given up to 
the novel from which it takes its name, a story in which 
the hero is a naval officer, the heroine the granddaughter 
of a naval officer, and most of the other characters con- 
nected with the sea. The story is well conceived, and 
told with a vividness which leaves little to be desired. 
The shorter stories which eke out the book are of all 
sorts, — naval, prairie, eastern, western, theatrical, mil- 
itary, juvenile, British, and American, — displaying the 
great versatility of their author. 

" Francezka," Miss Molly Elliot Seawell's latest ro- 
mance, is woven around the conquests and defeats of 
Maurice Count of Saxe. Above and beyond this his- 
torical element, however, it is a careful study in char- 
acter in which figure chiefly two brothers, the beautiful 
and sympathy-compelling girl who is the heroine, and 
the captain in Saxe's bodyguard who tells the story. 
With much daring, Miss Seawell leads her plot up to 



1902.]

an nninitigat«d tragedy, the note sounding early and 
makiiig anv other outcome artistically impossible. This 
-of itself would serve to distinguish it from other recent 
Tomanees, but it has also a constant interplay of char- 
acter and event which are not usual in works of its class. 
And, in addition, there is an insistent mystery through 
tlie last third of the narrative, not cleared up until the 
-eoDcludiDg chapter. Miss Seawell, in other words, has 
taken both her work and her art seriously, and has given 
the reading world a story far above the average of 
present-day romance. (Bowen-Merrill Co.) 

Having yielded to the persuasions of the man with 
whom she was for a moment infatuated, the heroine of 
Mr. Alexander Black's " Richard Gordon " (Lothrop) 
refuses to marry, as a result of her discoveries of both 
her and his true nature, and thenceforth dooms herself 
to celibacy. To her comes a successful lawyer pleading 
his passion. Though he feels his love to be returned, 
she still rejects him. He embarks in politics, and, when 
the war with Spain breaks out, goes with his regiment 
to the front. Returning, he is elected to the state legis- 
lature of New York. Behind the principal story appears 
a pitiful little experience between Gordon's sister and 
a self-indulgent painter, utterly without scruple, whom 
be has singularly befriended. The book shows an inti- 
mate knowledge of local political affairs and methods, 
contains many characters which stand out as types, and 
exhibits painstaking workmanship and no small literary 
ability. 

It is a pleasure to record the charm and literary 
worth of Mr. Roswell Field's little storv, " The Romance 
of an Old Fool " (William S. Lord)" Few books, to 
begin with, have succeeded in finding a name so indi- 
cative, not only of the substance of the tale, but of 
the spirit with which it is animated. A widower left 
.rich through his wife's death is leading a placid and 
easy existence, his age and inclination establishing a 
sort of avuncular relationship between himself and aU 
the pretty girls in the western suburban town where his 
home is situated. He returns to the little New Eng- 
land village where he was born and brought up, and 
here he chances upon the daughter of his first sweet- 
heart. With a mind mellowed by recollection, he con- 
ceives for her a mild, middle-aged affection, which he 
endeavois to convert into a real passion by consulting 
the books in his library. It would be manifestly unfair 
to both author and reader to anticipate the story fur- 
ther, so much pleasure is certain to result from its per- 
usal. Really, the only fault to be found with the book 
is its brevity. 

Miss Eleanor Gates's " The Biography of a Prairie 
Girl" (Century Co.) is a pleasant bit of realism, rem- 
iniscent in its point of view of some recent Scotch 
romances. An .'American family in the Dakotas, made 
up of three brothers and a sister, passes through all 
sorts of difficulties, tragic and trivial, only to triumph 
over them with fine courage and persistency. The nat- 
ural scenery about them is fully realized by the little 
heroine, and she fiads her pleasure in this and in her 
desultory studies. Miss Gates is fortunate in inter- 
preting these things to her readers, who will rise from 
the book with an increased respect for the men and 
women now wresting the living of the world from its 
soil at the cost of isolation and spiritual hardship. This 
is a real western novel, and the absence of so-called 
" love interest " makes it all the better reading. 

Were it not for the incredulity that must follow upon 
a forced acceptance of the idea that convicts who have 



served out their terms are entitled to fnll reinstatement 
in modem society, " The Things That Are Caesar's " 
(Appleton),by Mr. Reginald Wright Rauffman, would 
be an excellent book. In this case it is a bishop of the 
Anglican Church who finds occupation for his nephew 
after the latter's release from the penitentiary. As the 
facts of his former life become known, the ex-convict is 
of course thrown back upon his criminal pursuits, if he 
is to make a living at all. That he is strong enough to 
resist crime in the face of starvation, that he finds a 
former prison-mate his only friend, and that a good 
woman should not withold her love because of his early 
career, combine to give the book real interest. The basic 
problem remains unsolved, as it must, but the story is 
a great improvement in every respect upon " Jarvis of 
Harvard," from the same pen. 

In "The Lady of the Barge" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
Mr. W. W. Jacobs returns to an earlier manner with a 
succession of stories of coasting craft, delightfully naive 
and humorous, in nearly all of which a woman or two 
sacceeds in placing the men with whom she is asso- 
ciated in laughable predicaments. One or two of the 
tales deal with sailors on the high seas, and three at 
least have the element of horror and mystery and crime 
predominant. All are very brief, wholly episodic, and 
all interesting. As in former collections of his tales, 
Mr. Jacobs avoids the element of pathos to a marked 
degree. But the foibles of humankind are dealt with 
gently in every case, and the laughter is always with- 
out rancor. 

Mr. Herman Bernstein does not succeed in imparting 
anything of the spirit of America to his collection of 
short stories of the ghetto, published under the collec- 
tive title of " In the Gates of Israel " (J. F. Taylor & 
Co.). In its stead will be found something of the nni- 
Tcrsality of the modem Jew, and his ability to retain 
his elaborate ceremonial and rabbinical learning under 
circumstances the most adverse. It is evident from 
phrases in the book, as well as from the frontispiece to 
the volume, that the scene of Mr. Bernstein's stories 
is laid in New York ; yet it might be any of the Eu- 
ropean wipitals so far as local color is concerned. To 
many the inteiestiog fact in American Jewry is the diffi- 
ealty which ancient customs, made more binding by 
ages of unmerited persecution, have in withstanding the 
religions freedom of this republic, and the rapidity with 
which the Jew takes on American characteristics. There 
is little of this in Mr. Bernstein's pages, but a true pic- 
ture rather of the immigrants who are not yet in foil 
contact with American national life. 

M. Maurus Jokai appears in a new field, almost 
Rabelaisian in its suggestions, in his latest book, entitled 
" Told by the Death's Head " (Saalfield). A military 
engineer in the days when gunpowder was first finding 
general use in Europe is brought before a mixed tri- 
bunal, military and ecclesiastical, and the crime of 
betraying military secrets brought home to him. He 
pleads nothing in extenuation, but makes open confes- 
sion of the fact that he has committed every other 
known crime besides, violating the commands of church 
and state with entire impartiality. The lay member of 
the tribunal shows a somewhat unholy interest in the 
adventures which brought this result about, and, though 
the man is under condemnation to death, permits his 
execution to be deferred for the purpose of allowing 
him to disclose his methods of infraction of the moral 
and civil law. M. Jokai's amazing knowledge of 
Europe at the dawn of the Renaissance is displayed in

his account of the wide waoderiugs of his hero, and the 
book stands quite by itself among his translated works. 

The third of the war stories of Mr. B. K. Benson is 
called " Bayard's Courier " (Macmillau), and it enables 
his readers to construct a formula which covers them 
all. A careful study of a portion of the struggle be- 
tween the States gives him command of the scene and 
the participants down to the most minute details. To 
this, in order to enable the reader to follow both sides 
of the contest, is added a confusion of identities. In 
the first book it was a man with double identity ; in the 
latest it is a pair of unwitting twins, one federal and 
one confederate, who contribute to the complications, 
even up to the daring point of a marriage through error. 
There is a simplicity about Mr. Benson's narrative, an 
absence of sophistication, which is appealing to those 
jaded with psychological complexities; and with the 
exception of a single chapter there is a real advance in 
literary skill and manner of expression. 

" When Love Is Young " was a book which caught 
the transient affections of childhood so successfully 
that one could have been pardoned for believing a repe- 
tition of the same feat impossible. But Mr. Roy Rolfe 
Gilson has strengthened bis position in his second vol- 
ume, "In the Morning Glow" (Harper). It deals with 
the elders of a family and the children also, as seen 
with a boy's eyes. There are eight tales, — or chapters, 
as they might have been called, — and in every one of 
them the small boy's point of view is set forth with a 
charming accuracy, enabling the oldest of fogies to re- 
new his own youth. The humor is real, deepening into 
tears at times, — and that not always when sorrow 
comes to the happy little family. The illustrations by 
Mrs. Alice Barber Stephens add greatly to the value of 
the text. 

In " Napoleon Jackson: The Gentleman of the Plush 
Rocker" (Century Co.) Mrs. Ruth McEnery Stuart 
adds another to her tales of mingled humor and pathos 
dealing with negro life in the South. Napoleou Jackson 
is a gentleman of color who was marked by an over- 
worked mother for " rest " before his birth. And rest 
he does, in a fine red plush rocking-chair, while his 
faithful wife supports them both and a numerous pro- 
geny into the bargain ; until the whites of the neigh- 
borhood determine to put an end to bis idleness. A 
mock trial is arranged for, and the attendance of the 
entire Jackson family secured. The objections of the 
old grandmother that the same sort of conduct among 
whites leads to no interference, and the wife's plea that 
if she is satisfied — and she is — she sees no reason why 
the rest of the world should not be, bring about an 
acquittal. Few recent books have in them so much of 
genuine human nature as this. 

The short stories which Miss Josephine Dodge Das- 
kam has brought together in a volume bearing the title 
of the initial tale, " Whom the Gods Destroyed " (Scrib- 
ner), are serious little tqatters, concerned with the seamy 
side of life. There are eight of them, covering questions 
spiritual and mystical, bits of pathos that have little 
lame boys and sad old almshouse women in them, lives 
wrecked through drink — and these not always the lives 
of the drinkers, — a pitiful young poet who was all tem- 
perament, and for conclusion a most carefully-wrought 
bit of symbolism. There is depth to such work, as well 
as breadth, and the outlook upon life is that of sympa- 
thy and comprehension. 

Miss Frances £. Skinner has made an authorized 
translation of Herr Peter Rosegger's third novel, which 



appears in English under the title, "The Earth and 
the Fullness Thereof: A Romance of Modern Styria " 
(Putuam). The hero is a young man who has turned 
newspaper writer after his service in the Austrian army, 
until, disgusted with city life, he undertakes to earn a 
livelihood in the country. After many rebuffs, the 
recounting of which is redolent of humor, he secures 
a position on a peasant's farm, and becomes the head 
servant. There is a pretty girl in the family, the win- 
ning of whom takes more time than the city man had 
at first supposed. The style of the book, like its 
subject-matter, differs greatly from Herr Rosegger's 
other novels as they are known in America, being lighter 
and more hopeful in tone and exhibiting a deeper 
knowledge of city life. There is much more humor, 
too, though it is of the Teutonic order. The impres- 
sion left is one of great good nature and peace with all 
the world. 

By taking the beginning of Babylonian greatness 
rather than its ending, Mr. Josiah M. Ward has given 
his " Come with Me into Babylon " (Stokes) not only 
distinction of theme, but has left himself quite free from 
the claims of supernaturalism' inherent in the scriptural 
narrative of the fall of that great city. Historically, 
his hero is Nebuchadnezzar, not yet elevated to the 
throne, but bearing a foremost part in bringing Nineveh 
to the ground with the assistance of the Medes, Per- 
sians, and other allies. It is the prince of one of these 
Asiatic tribes who is most in the reader's eye, however, 
and a strong and heroic figure has been made of him. 
Mr. Ward has a full comprehension of the extent to 
which the peoples of Mesopotamia were priest-ridden 
in the period he has chosen for celebration, and he has 
made excellent use of the great banking bouse of Egibi, 
and of the Jews who were already in Babylon. The very 
absence of authentic history has given him a latitude, 
which has been wisely used, and the book is uniformly 
interesting. 

Miss Alice Woods is both author and illustrator of 
"Edges" (Bowen-Merrill Co.), a romance of the New 
England coast and of the studios of Paris. The former 
locality serves to introduce two art students of different 
sexes, and with them a well-drawn little Yankee urchin 
who obtains the reader's heart through his quaint natur- 
alness. After the two painters have thoroughly wrapped 
themselves up in one another, the heroine goes to the 
French capital, and increases her lover's interest by a 
number of charming letters which eke out the narrative. 
At last he follows her, and the inevitable happens. 
There is a full flavor of the better sort of bohemian 
life everywhere in the book. The illustrations are clever ; 
but the tone of the paper used in the volume, a pallid 
yellow, is far from prepossessing. 

Mr. Julian Ralph has written many better books than 
" The Millionairess " (Lothrop), which is a sequel to 
his " An Angel in a Web," and like most sequels, a dis- 
appointment. The two books have the same heroine, 
but whereas in the former story she was coming into 
her great fortune, in the latter she is learning how to 
use it. A large part of the book is devoted to a dem- 
onstration of the differences between the " smart set," 
which appears to be nearly everthing it ought not to 
be, and the smaller social circle of picked men and 
women who have succeeded in literature and the other 
arts or have achieved a name for actually doing some- 
thing in the world. So strong a picture does Mr. Ralph 
paint of the fashionable New Y'ork clique, especially of 
one or two impecunious members of it, and so nearly

the " perfect lady " does be draw bis heroiDe, tbat the 
leader's sympathies fail to go in the ditection evidently 
iatended. Mr. Ralph is certainly capable of better 
things. 

Deteetive stories, since they invariably deal with the 
fundamental passions of hnman nature, possess an in- 
terest not always proportionate to their literary worth. 
A ease in point is Mr. E. W. Hornung's " The Shadow 
of the Rope " (Scribner), where the murder of an 
elderly miser is followed by a series of daring attempts 
to rob bis heirs of the jewels of which bis wealth largely 
consisted. To complicate the problem there is a oon- 
fnsioD of indentities and a direction of suspicion toward 
an innocent person, who serves as the hero of the ro- 
mance, the heiress of the miser being the heroine. It 
is only just to say that the story is interesting to a de- 
gree, and quite as good of its kiod as any detective 
story recently written. 

With his pseudo-historical romance of " The Climax " 
(C. M Clark Co.) Mr. Charles Felton Pidgin has car- 
ried nearly to the point of absurdity the fashion set 
by Mrs. Atherton in " The Conqueror." The earlier 
-chapters read, indeed, as if Mr. Pidgin intended his 
book as an antidote to Mrs. Atberton's panegyric of 
Alexander Hamilton, though Mr. Pidgin attacks Jeffer- 
son quite as strongly as does Mrs. Atherton. His hero is 
Aaron Burr, erected to the statnre of a demi-god. The 
actualities are left after a few pages, and the story strikes 
oat into the conjectural. Burr is elected president of 
the United States; he conquers Mexico, Canada, South 
America, and leaves the stars and stripes waving over 
the entire continent. By wise legislation be brings the 
people of this vast territory into peace and plenty, and 
passes away as the crowning figure of all human history. 
Mr. Pidgin's literary powers are too limited to bring 
-conviction to his readers, and the book is really one for 
the curious. 

There is a return to a day almost forgotten in politer 
letters in Mrs. Augusta Evans Wilson's " A Speckled 
Bird" (Dillingham). Little has been learned and 
nothing forgotten, apparently, by Mrs. Wilson since the 
production of "St. Elmo" — and that was in 1866. 
The new book is crowded with detail and episode, — 
enough, almost, for six books as they are written nowa- 
days. There is the same use of the abstruse knowledge 
to be gleaned from popular encyclopedias. The men 
are of astonishing taxe and learning and dtaiaeter, either 
very good or very bad. The women are paragons of 
their sex, and the victims of circumstances which give 
them an insistent apfteal to sentiment. Mrs. Wilson 
was a pioneer in the demand for the higher education 
of women, and her latest heroine is a college graduate 
accordingly. The story turns on the love this girl bears 
to her father, a plausible and inevitable scoundrel who 
began his downward career as a carpetbagger. The 
one novelty in the book is a labor agitator, who is so- 
cialist and anarchist in one. Unquestionably "A Speckled 
Bird " will be widely read, and that by those to whom 
books in a later manner make no appeal whatever- 
Miss Le Feurre's stories have always an insistent 
strain of evangelical Christianity running through them, 
and her latest, " A Daughter of the Sea " (Crowell), is 
no exception. The scene is laid upon a rocky shore in 
England, where a young girl grows up as free as the 
winds and waves about her. Her companions, fisher- 
folk by occupation, are wreckers whenever opportunity 
offers, and it is the heroine's self-imposed duty to bring 
these people to a realization of the claims of humanity. 



The girl has a guardian who appears in the book chiefly 
for the purpose of marrying her in all her innocence to 
one who is little more than an acquaintance, thoagfa 
a man of cultivation and letters. Single-handed, witb- 
oat her husband's knowledge, she undertakes the work 
of warning vessels away from the threatening coast, 
and her reward comes at the close of the book. A 
clergyman plays an imptortant part in laying the way 
for the change effected in the fishers' minds and souls, 
and his crowu of glory is given him in another manner. 
The book is interesting and out of the ordinary. 

It is the Dorsetshire of William Barnes which one 
meets in " The Manor Farm " (Longmans), by Mrs. 
Francis BlundeU — " M. E. Francis." Quotations from 
Barnes's poems in the dialect of the countryside head 
every chapter. An estate held for several generations 
by a family of yeomen has been divided in days gone 
by and is now held by two cousins. One has a son, the 
other a daughter ; and, naturally enough, the two are 
affianced to one another while yet in infancy. And, 
no less naturally, the boy and girl, growing up in the 
closest intimacy, rebel against the decree they had no 
share in making. The young man earries his revolt to 
the point of leaving home, a eta a tad by a sudden in- 
fatuation for a pretty but calculating schoolmistress 
from a neighboring town. After he has left home and 
suffered disinheritance in consequence, her reason for 
listening to his suit is gone, and he comes forth sadly 
disillusioned. The rest of the argument may safely be 
left to the reader's imagination. It is a pleasant little 
tale, the dialect not being too recondite for Amerieaa 
readers, and the pastoral picture being clearly drawn. 
Life is still worth living in rural England, as this story 
proves. 

Mrs. Kate Upson CUrk, the author of " White But- 
terflies," has written another idyllic story of semi-rural 
life, calling it " Up the Witch Brook Road " (J. F. 
Taylor & Co.). The scene is laid somewhere in the in- 
terior of the country at a period before the civil war. 
Two young Bostonians come into the region prospecting 
for gold, with little chance of finding it. They intro- 
duce an agreeable flutter in a dore-cote of young women, 
— the aunts or cousins once removed of the little giri 
who tells the story. What seems to be a murder throws 
the little community into a state of prime excitement, 
wherein the prejudice of the rustic against the city 
man seems to threaten the very lives of the men from 
Boston. The spirit of the book, in spite of this and of 
another tragedy recorded, is simple, sweet, and serene, 
and serves to convey an accurate picture of a distant 
day. 

Villains eome to the front in Mr. S. Levett-Yeats's 
later romances, and "The Lord Protector" (Long- 
mans) is qoite without a hero except as Cromwell may 
be supposed to occupy the centre of tbe stage. And it 
is a thorough-going rascal, a deceiver of women and a 
traitor to any cause, who serves as the protagonist here. 
His unfaithfulness leads to his complete undoing, and 
if ever an evil doer had poetical justice meted out to 
him it is this one. There is the same vividness of con- 
ception and interesting historical detail that have marked 
the earlier work of this author, and the scriptural lan- 
guage in the months of the followers of Parliament 
adds an element rarely found in stories of the sword- 
and-cloak order. Mr. Levett- Yeats has little sympathy 
with tbe deeds and character of Cromwell, and paints 
him as suffering infinite remorse for bis share in the 
execution of Charles.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Having written an interesting drama, Mr. Opie Read 
has turned it into a book not so interesting, calling it 
still "The Starbucks" (Laird & Lee). The reduction 
to fiction form of a play that has been acted is certain 
to give the narrative a quality that makes against litera- 
ture of the better sort, and it is rather as a souvenir 
of the play than as a work in itself that the volume is 
valuable. The story is concerned with the mountaineers 
of Tennessee, among whom a city woman and her 
nephew take refuge against the more intense life of 
civilization. The Starbuck family shelters them, and 
a double romance springs up between the aunt and 
preacher son, and the nephew and pretty daughter. 
There is a great deal of the sort of sentiment that ap- 
peals to the play-going public in the story, and there is 
a great deal too much dialogue, — inherited faults from 
the original dramatization. Yet Mr. Read is so familiar 
with his ground, and the characters are so well differ- 
entiated, that the story is entirely readable. 

In "Wolfville Nights" (Stokes), another book of 
the sort that Mr. Alfred Lewis has identified himself 
with in recent years, there is no apparent diminution of 
unusual incident, though the scene and characters are 
those which have already done service in three or four 
previously-published volumes. These Wolfville stories, 
however, since they depict a frontier cattle town in days 
which have gone for ever, are typical of so much in our 
shifting civilization that we can hardly have too much 
of them from one who has lived the life he describes. 
The dialect itself, a wonderful admixture of uncouth 
phrasing and nervous idiom, is well worth preserving. 
The most original part of the new volume is the ex- 
tended dedication to Colonel William Greene Sterrett, 
who has been assigned so prominent a place in all the 
annals of Wolfville. 



Briefs on New Books. 



It 18 nearly thirty years since the 
^^SnlJT Chevalier D'Arneth, director of the 

Imperial archives of Austria, pub- 
lished the Correspondance secrete entre Marie 
ThSrhse et le comte de Mercy- Argenteau. From 
these letters Miss Lillian C. Smythe has selected 
passages for translation and commeDt, and has put 
the whole into two Tolumes aggregating 700 pages, 
under the title " The Guardian of Marie Antoinette " 
(Dodd). Even those unacquainted with the letters 
in their original form will be able to discover from 
these selections that the correspondence is indis- 
pensable for the study of Marie Antoinette's devel- 
opment. Unhappily, the commentator has not made 
the wisest use of her opportunity. It is impossible 
to edit such letters without some knowledge of the 
condition of France during the eighteenth century 
beyond that which may be gained from an uncrit- 
ical familiarity with the memoirs of the period. As 
the author's comments are thrown into the form of 
a narrative this defect becomes more glaring. For 
example, she speaks of the abolition of the old parlia- 
ments by Maupeou as " the first grapple between the 
people and the despotism of royalty." Whatever this 
attempted reform may have been, it was not that. 
She further declares that the edict of 1781, requir- 



ing all candidates for lieutenancies in the army to 
show four generations of nobility on the father's 
side, " spread despair and furious resentment in the 
middle classes of France, and flung them back into 
the serfdom of the peasantry," — a fate which, to 
say the least, is ill-described, since very few of the 
peasants were serfs. She also becomes eloquent over 
the legendary ^acie de famine. In her references 
to Louis XVI. she heaps up adjectives expressive 
of loathing. In one passage she calls him "an im- 
becile — a waddling, blinking, corpulent, bungling, 
incapable imbecile, defective in body, deficient in 
mind, with the low receding forehead of an idiot, 
and a monstrous chin, that measured the third of 
his face." In spite of this outburst, she reproduces 
(opposite page 378) a "magnificent" portrait of 
Louis, presented to Mercy- Argenteau in 1776. This 
is certainly the most flattering portrait of the king 
in existence, and represents him as a handsome, 
rather slender man. The author's ptyle shows a 
headlong liveliness mistaken for esprit. She con- 
stantly throws in French phrases easily translatable, 
which fail in their present form to add the desired 
piquancy to the expression of thought. Notwith- 
standing these defects, it is possible by a judicious 
use of the selections to form some impression of 
Marie Antoinette's character between 1770 and 
1778. 

It is rather exceptional in present- 
plTcautJ.. day scholarship to read in the pre- 

face of a book such as Professor 
Dunning's " Political Theories, Ancient and Mod 
em" (Macmillan) words so modest as the following r 
" If the successive transformations through which 
the political consciousness of men has passed from 
early antiquity to modern times are rendered in 
any degree more intelligible, or even if any sugges- 
tion is given through which another pen may here- 
after render them more intelligible, this volume will 
not have been issued in vain." This seems almost 
too unassuming an attitude for a writer who must 
have undertaken a work of that character not as a 
diversion, but with a definite ambition of supplying 
a want and enriching our knowledge. Perhaps this 
attitude is inspired by an examination of the pro- 
found and masterly work of Gierke lately translated 
into English, which of course cannot help influ- 
encing the reader's opinion of Professor Dunning's 
treatment of the same period. Be this as it may, 
his book is throughout agreeably unassuming in 
tone ; the author nowhere thrusts forward his learn- 
ing to be admired, — indeed, he can hardly be said 
to express an opinion with a personal note in it. but 
gravely and dispassionately follows up his subject 
from Plato to Machiavelli. The discussion of po- 
litical theories is in each case preceded by a sketch 
of the political history of the period, and of the 
prevailing form of government from whose practices 
the philosophers drew their experience of politics in 
general. These sketches appear to us the least sat- 
isfactory parts of the book. In the case of Greece

and Rome they are enperflnoas, and contain nothing 
bat what is alread j known ; and in the case of 
medisTal political history, the review is hardly 
comprehenBiTe enongh. It is not merely with the 
empire and the papacy, the two phases of original 
power, that a discnssion of this kind onght to be 
concerned, bat also with the delegated power which 
meant feudal rule and was eqaivalent to more than 
half the power in the state. An eqaally important 
phase was city self-gOTernment. If, instead of 
confining himself so entirely to the philosophical 
digressions of the schoolmen, with their composite 
of Aristotle, Rome, and Church-law, the author had 
nndertaken to extract the workable and equally 
potent theories of government presented in the laws 
and customs, the result for Uie medieval period 
might have been less halting and indefinite. The 
ecclesiastical writers, although excellently equipped 
for presenting the ideas of the Church on universal 
government, had altogether too vast and vague a 
conception of rule to enlighten us upon what was 
in reality the theory of mediaeval politics. On the 
other hand, the author's own treatment of these 
questions is original, and may help to dispel from 
the student's mind the current opinion, entertained 
too long, that the Middle Age was unpolitical. In- 
deed, the period of legislation and written consti- 
totions was not yet come ; but the making of const!-' 
tations was nevertheless an every-day practice. 
The book manifests extensive reading, and presents 
results with great clearness ; not a word is wasted, 
everything serves its proper purpose of giving in- 
formation and instruction. 



Tit 
anmllife. 



That the romantic and the realistic 
have long since joined hands in 
America, has been shown by abun- 
dant evidence ; and new proof is furnished by Mr. 
R. G. Thwaites, in his recent biography of the 
great hunter of Kentucky, Daniel Boone, issued as 
one of the series of "Life Histories" (Appleton). 
This remarkable career is here traced graphic- 
ally from beginning to end. The restlessness of 
the habitual woodsman made Boone continuously a 
pioneer, and four several times he abandoned a 
settled neighborhood for a new and farther advanced 
position on the very frontier of civilization ; for he 
always found the settlements " too crowded." and 
he ever required, as he once declared, " more elbow- 
room." even when making his last remove, at the 
age of sixty-five. Mr. Thwaites's portraiture of the 
forest huntsman, Indian warrior, frontier settler, 
border surveyor, military commander, and Western 
statesman, gives a vivid idea of the characteristics 
of this pioneer in many States. While Boone was 
never a great man nor a brilliant leader, and was 
always unsuccessful in his personal speculations, 
yet he was an excellent and a picturesque example 
of those sturdy yeomen whose work it was to de- 
velop the greatness of the Mississippi valley. His 
contributions to that work, and the elements of 
rugged strength which made him successful as a 



•/•fTMl 



pioneer and have endeared his memory to the stren- 
noas youth of every generation since his own, are 
made clearly manifest in this volume. The "short 
and simple annals " of the advance-guard of our 
Western settlements are here seen to be of the staff 
from which romance is woven, and to be, indeed, 
essentially and intrinsically romantic. Those who 
have followed with interest the fortunes of " Alice 
of Old Vincennes " and her comi)eers, in march, 
raid, and battle, and through adventure, captare, 
and hardship, to final triumph, may find idl the 
romance of the novelist duplicated in this recital of 
the cold facts of one life, spent in the very fields 
and forests, and along the same frontier occupied 
by the novelist's story, and in the company, too, 
of the very characters of oar frontier history who 
were made to live and act in the pages of that stir- 
ring romance. Yet it was once lamented that there 
was so little of the romantic in America. 

The completion of Professor Bald- 
win's '• Dictionary of Philosophy and 
Psychology " is itself a notable event. 
The work was began five years ago ; the first toI- 
ame appeared a year ago, and was reviewed in The 
Dial of October 16, 1901 ; the third volume will be 
devoted to Bibliographies, and is in a measure a 
separate work. All that was said of the first vol- 
ume applies with increased emphasis to the work as 
a whole. It is a distinct achievement to have car- 
ried through so successfully an undertaking of this 
kind ; and while the work is international in char- 
acter, it can fairly be set down as a highly creditable 
testimonial to the philosophers and psychologists 
of America. It testifies at once to the very great 
importance which is attached to these subjects in 
modern thought, and to the characteristically prom- 
inent position that these studies occupy in the Amer- 
ican intellectual life. It seems likely that the various 
needs of the various persons who will go to this dic- 
tionary for help, will be reasonably satisfied. The 
encyclop»dic features of the work are decidedly to be 
commended ; and on the whole those articles are most 
valuable that have been presented with sufficient 
deUil to give some taste of the spirit of inquiry that 
has been instrumental in formulating the results set 
down. Had all the articles been treated with the ful- 
ness accorded to those on Logic, the work would have 
extended to double its present size ; while the treat- 
ment of the Oriental Philosophies is out of all pro- 
portion to that of any other topic whatever. Like- 
wise it is true that on several important matters 
the dictionary is no more adequate than one not 
devoted to the special disciplines which it covers. 
Such failures of proportion are inevitable when so 
many minds contribute to so complex a task ; and 
the editor has, in the main, reduced them to a min- 
imum. He has likewise been more than liberal in 
the treatment accorded to such topics as Telepathy 
and Psychical Research ; many will conclude that 
such hospitality is in a measure misplaced, not per 
se, but in the consequences that are apt to ensue

therefrom. Bat a criticism that is itself sane and 
generoas will have little to excuse and much to ap- 
plaud in the assignments of parts and the manner 
of their execution. In the completion of this work 
another standard and much-needed aid has been 
added to those that already serve as milestones in 
the progress of learning. 



Some worthies The history of the city of Charles- 
«/ow CAari«<oicn, town, Massachusetts, the biogra- 
jf<w,«cA«<,«,. pjjjgg jjj b.ief of its leading and 

long-resident citizens, and the familiar reminiscences 
of most of the families of the town, are all summed 
up gracefully and entertainingly by Mr. Timothy 
T. Sawyer, in a goodly book of over 500 pages 
entitled " Old Charlestown" (James H. West Co.). 
The author, who was himself of the honorable 
procession of eminent citizens, knew his subjects 
well, participated in a very large part of the events 
worth narrating in a town history, and may well 
say to his readers, " Magna pars fui." The kindly 
gossip of such a townsman will of course appeal, 
first of all, to the inhabitants of that particular part 
of the modern Boston, and their immediate friends 
and relatives. But the list of names of those who 
are the subjects of these reminiscences will bespeak 
for Mr. Sawyer's modest volume the respectful 
attention of a large circle of American readers. 
Among the residents of Charlestown, by birth or 
adoption, we find such eminent names as Edward 
Everett, Governor and Senator; Nathaniel Gorham 
and Samuel Dexter, statesmen ; Dr. Jedidiah 
Morse, geographer; Prof. S. F. B. Morse, artist 
and electrician ; Richard Frothingham, historian ; 
Edwin H. Cbapin and Thomas Starr King, preach- 
ers ; Charles Devens, jurist ; William D. Kelley, 
congressman ; Oliver Holden, hymn-writer and 
author of " Coronation "; and Harvard, Tufts, 
Doane, Colby, and Carleton, the name of each of 
whom has been given to and perpetuated in an 
American college. The old town has also been 
visited by and has suitably entertained such illus- 
trious visitors as Washington, Lafayette, Webster, 
and Kossuth. It is indeed a wealth of lively remi- 
niscences in which are gathered and preserved the 
ana of such a group of men and their numberless 
contemporaries. 

An anthoiooy of Professor Leo Wiener has projected 
Euiaian an important " Anthology of Russian 

Literature " (Putnam), to present 
biographical sketches and typical extracts repre- 
sentative of all periods from the tenth to the nine- 
teenth century. The work is to fill two volumes, 
and the first of them, extending to the close of the 
eighteenth century, is now at hand. While we can 
hardly agree with the editor in thinking that Rus- 
sian is soon destined to take an important place in 
the American educational curriculum, we are sure 
that he has done us a valuable service in supplying 
this generous representation of the literature of his 
country, for English translations from the Russian 



have thus far been few in number (except for 
the novelists) and poor in quality, and the his- 
tory of Russian literature from the earliest times 
down to the last century is practically a sealed 
book to most of our readers. Pushkin we know, and 
Gogol, and their successors, but concerning Russian 
literature more than a hundred years old the gen- 
eral public has practically no fund of information. 
A name of two in the present volume — Lomonosov 
or Derzhavin — may awaken some association, but 
most of the names mentioned are absolutely un- 
known. In his introductory pages. Professor Wiener 
gives us a conspectus of existing English translation 
and criticism, and a meagre showing it makes. 
After a sketch of the history of Russian literature, 
in thirty or forty pages, he begins his proper task 
with a translation of the treaty with the Greeks made 
in 911. Legal documents, ecclesiastical writings and 
chronicles are chiefly characteristic of the first sec- 
tion of the work, although we find here also a few 
songs and the striking epic of "The Word of Igor's 
Armament." Then follows a section of folklore, 
including folksongs and fables, and then a section 
devoted to the writers of the eighteenth century. 
Most of the translations have been made expressly 
for this work, although the editor has not hesitated 
to draw upon the material offered by earlier trans- 
lators. His debt is thus considerable to Sir John 
Bo wring (although the Derzhavin " Ode to God " 
is given in a less familiar but more literal version), 
and to the remarkable work of Mrs. Edward Robin- 
son (" Talvi ") which " is authoritative even now in 
many departments that have not been overthrown 
by later investigations." We shall await with much 
interest the concluding volume of this work, which 
will deal with the fairly familiar writers and books 
of the nineteenth century. 

Literary Europe The eighth volume in point of pub- 
in the age lication, and the ninth in the serial 

of Voltaire. ^^^^^^ ^^ Professor Saintsbury's 

"Periods of European Literature" (Seribner) has 
just appeared. It is entitled " The Mid-Eighteenth 
Century," and is the work of Mr. J. H. Millar. The 
period is exactly that of the literary career of Vol- 
taire, who is naturally the most conspicuous figure 
among the many dealt with. The exigencies of the 
series to which this book belongs have made it bet- 
ter to exclude from the volume such English writers 
as Swift and Pope, who belong to the Augustan Age, 
as well as Lessing, who will be considered in a later 
volume dealing with the great age of German liter- 
ature. Even Rousseau and Diderot are here con- 
sidered only in part, their later work being reserved 
for final judgment in the history of " The Romantic 
Revolt." The literatures of France and England 
make up nine-tenths of the contents of the present 
volume. The opening two chapters are devoted to 
Voltaire, Montesquieu, and the group of " Encyclo- 
psBdia writers " ; then follows a chapter on English 
philosophy ; then five further chapters concerning 
both French and English works in the five depart-

menu of fiction, poetry, the drama, history and eco- 
nomics, and criticism and memoirs. " The Rest of 
Earope " geta the ninth chapter, and a far too per- 
fnnctory treatment, in view of the fact that it in- 
cludes Klopstock, Wieland, Ewald, Swedenborg, 
Goldoni, and Metastasio, to mention only a few 
names. Mr. Millar has performed his task in a 
workmanlike manner, and combined with scholarlj 
aeqaaintanee with his subject an attractive style. 

When a volume of theatrical renii- 
niscences from the pen of Clara 
Morris is announced, we look for- 
ward to its publication with pleasurable anticipations 
based upon the author's exceptional qualifications 
for her task. The volume of her '• Stage Confi- 
dences " (Lothrop Publishing Company) contains 
many choice bits, with little of that unnecessary 
padding frequently resorted to in similar volumes 
to fill space. In short, it is a characteristically frank 
and racy book. Opening with a chapter dedicated 
to the " stage-struck " girl, warning her of obstAcles 
and hindrances with the candor of one who has 
known them all, the author talks with humor, point, 
and charm of the mysterious and alluring life be- 
hind the footlights : she gives us peeps at the shams 
and deceptions of the stage, and in a peculiarly open 
manner strips it of its false glitter. The most in- 
teresting portions of the book are made up of the 
little stories of the actress' own career which show 
how truly the most dramatic scenes in plays reflect 
the happenings of actual life. The interspersed 
illustrations are exceedingly life-like, and a number 
are valuable as portraits of a by-gone generation 
of men and women of more or less talent and dis- 
tinction. 

Vtter a»d rikyOa '" Chapters on Greek Metri c " ( Scrib- 
al On^ ner), by Professor Thomas D wight 
nd BufHtk. Goodell, is not the least important 
of the "Yale Bicentennial Publications," contain- 
ing as it does an inquiry into the entire question 
raised by Hellenic scansion, being informed not only 
with classical erudition but with full modern know- 
ledge upon a difficult subject. After a brief state- 
ment of the " Scope and Method " of the book Pro- 
fessor Goodell passes at once to the longest paper 
of the five that make up its contents, the title of it 
indicating sufficiently the ancient (and modern) con- 
troversy between •• Rhythmicns or Metricus? " 
The works of commentators and grammarians have 
been ransacked to shed contemporaneous light on 
the discussion, with a judicial summing up in favor 
of the rhythtnicu. and a warning that the metrvei 
are not to be neglected for the good there is in 
them. Much more general is the inquiry into the 
problems of ** Rhythm and Language." which fol- 
lows, involving English poetry and the general 
question of quantity, and containing a discriminat- 
ing though brief criticism of the work of Sidney 
Lianier. which should be read by all who are dis- 
posed to settle metrical controversies by setting 
down a few Procrustean rules. From this to 



" Rhythm in Greek " is an inevitable step, and an 
eminently sane conclusion is reached, which sees no 
difficulty in correlating accent and quantity, while 
discriminating between verses spK>ken and verses 
sang. The remaining chapters, on " Foot, Ictus, 
'Cyclic ' Feet" and -Compound and Mixed Me- 
ters," are more technical and equally sound.

The series of "Oxford University 
College Histories " (Datton) is en- 
riched by the account of Oriel pre- 
pared by Mr. David Watson Rannie, M. A., sometime 
a member of the college. Oriel has an interesting 
history, running back to its foundation by Adam de 
Brome, in the service of Edward II., in the year 
1326. Names of significance in all of England's 
activities are to be found on the roll of the college 
through more than four hundred years. John 
Keble. John Henry Newman, Hartley Coleridge, 
Joseph Blanco White, James Anthony Froude, 
Arthur Hugh Clough, Mark Pattison, and Thomas 
Hughes, may be mentioned among those of the last 
century, with many more equally well known. Oriel 
feUowships have always been highly prized, and 
many men have been attracted by them from the 
other colleges. Mr. Rannie's account is interesting, 
and follows the events of history closely, while it is 
inclusive enough to devote a chapter to the athletics 
of the college. Photographs of both the exteriors 
and interiors of the buildings aid in leaving that 
indefinable impression of cultivation and tradition 
which must continue to be the despair of many 
American institutions of learning for some gen- 
erations.

Ue SMfiui uu^ ^^^ already famous in the annals of 
English literature, and this identification is now 
carried another step by his " Rambler's Note-Book 
at the English likkes" (Macmillan). Eighteen 
brief papers make np the contents of the present 
volume. Few of the papers are concerned directly 
with the poetic memories that cluster about the 
famous region, but all have a literary flavor and 
are animated by the love of nature from which the 
poets of a long generation ago took their inspiration. 
They cover a variety of interests, from the com- 
memoration of local customs to the local observance 
of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, from otter- 
hunting to the finding of neolithic implements; and 
they contain many fine descriptions of the scenery 
of the lovely countryside.

311 high schools in the State. Unfortunately, the 
Chicago schools, the most important of all, do not seem 
to be included. Since no list of schools is given, we 
base this statement upon internal evidence, and it is 
proved by the reports upon the subjects of Spanish, 
economics, and mechanical drawing. Nothing is said 
to account for this extraordinary omission, which seri- 
ously vitiates the study. We could wish that attention 
had also been given to the financial side of the subject. 
Figures which might be used to show the contrast be- 
tween Illinois and Massachusetts, for example, would 
have been very instructive. 

Miss Agnes M. Gierke's " A Popular History of 
Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century " (Maomil- 
lan) has reached a fourth edition (which it well de- 
serves), and in its latest form for the first time covers 
the full century of the title. The text has been enlarged 
and revised throughout. It is a book of fascinating 
interest, owing in part to the author's skilful treatment 
of the subject, and also in no small measure to the fact 
that astronomy is a science susceptible beyond most 
others of popularization without loss of educational 
value. The work makes a substantial volume of nearly 
five hundred pages, with illustrations. 

Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles has had much ex- 
perience in the making of anthologies, and we are con- 
sequently prepared to find in bis "Treasury of Humorous 
Poetry," just published by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co., 
a judiciously chosen selection of entertaining pieces. 
His aim has been to include "only extracts that are 
strictly amusing to modern readers," which results in a 
book that makes no pretence of illustrating the historical 
development of English humor in verse. He takes the 
terra humor very broadly, however, and his volume in- 
cludes many pieces that are serious as well as humorous. 
Including the notes, the book contains over four hundred 
pages, and considerably more than a hundred authors 
are represented. 

" The Teaching of Chemistry and Physics in the Sec- 
ondary School," by Professors Alexander Smith and 
Edwin H. Hall, is a new volume in the " American 
Teachers' Series " of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
It is a work of great value, both for its discussion of 
methods and for its practical sections. We note, among 
other matters, that it strongly discountenances the ex- 
traordinary heresy (that seemed to be gaining a certain 
credence a few years ago) which would begin the teach- 
ing of chemistry before its necessary physical founda- 
tions had been laid. " Whether chemistry or physics 
should come first is thus seen to be an idle question. 
Physics musl come first." This is the conclusion of the 
argument, and there are no conceivable rational grounds 
upon which it may be reversed.

" Qualitative Analysis," a college manual by Messrs.

" Martineau's Religionspbilosophie " is the subject of

" Foundation Lessons in English Language and Gram- 
mar," by Messrs. O. I. and M. S. Wood ley, with the

" The Grounds of Theistic and Christian Belief," by 
Dr. George Park Fisher, is published by Messrs. Charles 
Soribner's Sons in a new edition, in great part rewritten. 
Some score of years intervene between this and the 
original publication of the work. 

The writings of Mr. Brander Matthews are slowly 
reappearing in revised form and up-to-date typo- 
graphical garb. It is the third edition of " Aspects of 
Fiction " (Scribner) that is now before us, and the vol- 
ume is somewhat swollen by new matter. 

Messrs. Hinds & Noble publish a little book called 
"How to Study Literature," the work of Mr. Ben- 
jamin A. Heydrick. It is a book of helpful outlines and 
syllabi, illustrating the chief literary species as well as 
certain masterpieces selected for treatment. 

Mr. Charles Burnout's " Mediieval Europe," covering 
the period from 395 to 1270, has been translated into 
English by Miss Mary Sloan, and provided with notes 
and revisions by Professor George Burton Adams. It 
is intended for school use, and comes from the press of 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

The "New Wayside Edition" of "The Complete 
Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne," published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., presents the greatest of 
American men of letters in comparatively inexpensive 
form. There are thirteen volumes in the set, printed 
from the old plates, and on rather thin paper, but neat 
and attractive in appearance. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page, & Co., believing that there 
is a reading public as well as a music-loving public for 
the libretti of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, have ven- 
tured to publish the text of "Patience; or, Bunthorne's 
Bride " in a neat volume. The experiment deserves 
encouragement, and enough readers should be found to 
justify further texts of this sort. 

The Johns Hopkins Press has issued a volume con- 
taining the various addresses made at Baltimore last 
February upon the occasion of the quarter-centennial 
of the University's existence, and the inauguration of 
President Remsen. Much matter of more than ephem- 
eral interest is included within these covers, and the 
book must occupy a place iu every educational collection. 

Mr. G. Mantellini has translated, and Messrs. Laird 
& Lee have published, "The Dead City," by Signer 
d'Annunzio. This is a timely publication in view of 
the present visit of Signora Duse to our shores for the 
express purpose of making us acquainted with this work 
and its fellows. It will enable many an auditor to make 
a brave show of understanding the performance of the 
play.

" Labberton's Universal History," as now published 
by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co., is the latest revision 
of a work that has, in its earlier forms, done good edu- 
cational service for the past score of years. It is still 
an atlas, although no longer called so, and the maps are 
still its most important feature, although the text is far 
more extensive than in the earlier editions. 

The unusually interesting issue of " The Sewanee 
Beview " for October signalizes the completion of the 
tenth volume of that quarterly publication. The interest 
attaches to the articles that make up the body of the 
issue, and also to the editorial retrospect of Professor 
John Bell Henneman, the efBcient successor of Professor 
Trent in the conduct of the review. The "Sewanee " 
does not have one-tenth of the readers that it deserves. 
It is the only magazine we have that takes literature for 
its chief subject and takes it seriously. The others give 
us pictures, and gossip, and literary superficialities, and 
get the circulation. What this gives us instead may 
best be judged by an inspection of the classified general 
index to the ten volumes that is appended to the present 
issue. It presents a record to be proud of, and all the 
more so because of the discouragements under which its 
very genuine success has been achieved. 

We have several times mentioned, with commenda- 
tions, the series of special limited editions which Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have issued from their River- 
side Press. The latest, as well as the most ambitions 
and extensive, undertaking of the Press is a reprint of 
Montaigne's Essays, in three folio volumes, the first of 
which is now near completion. Two hundred and fifty 
copies only will be sold to subscribers, at 3120. for the 
set. The prospectus and sample pages of this work in- 
dicate that it will be one of the great achievements of 
American book-making. The type is of a special cut, 
and, like the illustrations, borders, initials, and decora- 
tions, is modeled on the best early French designs. All 
the mechanical and artistic features of the work are 
under the supervision of Mr. Bruce Rogers, whose taste 
and craftsmanship have appeared in the best productions 
of the Riverside Press ; while the engraving of por- 
traits is by Mr. Lamont Brown, and of the initials and 
borders by Mr. H. F. W. Lyonns and Miss Caroline A. 
Powell. The text, in English, is based on the famous 
Florio translation, and there will be ample notes and 
a bibliog^phy by Mr. George B. Ives. Other features 
of this edition, which cannot be noted here, will con- 
tribute to its literary and mechanical perfection, and 
to making it one of the grandest of recent prizes for the 
book-lover and collector.

embodying the results of much careful investigation

THE VIRGINIA EDITION OF 

Edgar Allan Poe 

Edited by JAMES A. HARRISON, in the University of Virginia 

Witli Introductions by HAMILTON W. MABIE and CHARLES W. KENT 

and Notes by R. A. STEWART 

The Only Complete and Accurate Text in Existence 

A glance at the new Virginia Edition of Poe, in 17 volumes, will substantiate all that is claimed for it. It has 
rejected the work of all previous editors and gone back directly to Poe himself, thus disclosing many errors and 
important new material. A biography is also added and a volume of letters. 

The illustrations and features of manufacture are worthy of this great work. 



What Others Say 



**Mo8t valuable."— Pro/. William P, Trent^ Columbia. 

"Exquisite." — Prof. Edward Howard Origgs. 

" Worthy of the favor of studenta." — A'. Y. Mail and Expreu. 

**The fullest collection yet presented to the public." — Neie 
York Sun, 

"Gives every promise of being the best that has ever appeared 
in any country." — James Lane Allen, 

"No man living who could do this work so well," — Oeorge 
Gary Eggleston. 

"Will be a great addition to the Poe literature." — Thoma* 
Nelson Page. 

"Not only an authentic text of the old material^ but considerable 
matter which is practically new."— AT. Y. Commercial Advertiser. 

"Not until this late day has an edition of Poe appeared that is 
complete and authentic."— .firoo^/t/n Eagle. 

** Admirable both as literary work and as a piece of book-making. 
... It is difficult to see how the edition could be improved." — 
Pro/. Henry van Dyke, Princeton. 

"No other edition of Poe does justice to his versatile genius." 
New York American and Journal. 

** The most valuable compilation of the writer*s wonderful liter- 
ary productions that has yet been given to his readers, and may 
well be received as authoritative and final."— Richmond Despatch. 

"Treated as Poe's writings have been by Prof. Harrison, the 
American world of letters owes him a debt of gratitude bard to 
measure." — Louitville Courier-Journal. 

"Undisturbed by the massing about him of fancied * improve- 
ments * by eager friends or conceited critics, it will be plain that 
Prof. Harrison has brought to literature a real gift, has conferred 
upon it a true benefit."— Syracuse Herald. 

"Ranks among the more important literary enterprises of the 
year." — The Argonaut. 

** Complete, authentic, annotated." — Outlook. 

"The only edition in any real sense complete." — Pro/. W. 8. 
Currell. 

** One of the most important literary ventures of the season. " — 
Publishers' Weekly. 



"Certainly a complete and satisfying Poe, and he is brought 
home as never before in any one collection of books to the reader." 
Totcn and Country. 

" As thorough and complete an edition of the works of Virgin- 
ginia's most famous literaiy genius as it is possible to publish."— 
Ilichmond Times. 

" Throws upon the life and character of the dead poet a flood of 
new light and also presents his literary creations in a manner which 
enables us to judge of them in their true value —that which they 
bore to their creator when they left his hand for appeal to the 
public verdict. ... An edition which must prove indispensable to 
every one who has at heart the love of American literature."— Bal- 
timore Sun. 

" The e£Fort of the editor and publishers has been to place before 
the world a true, just estimate of the actual living man as he really 
was, neither deified by over-admiring friends nor vilified by enemies, 
and in that such effort has been eminently auccesaf ul they may feel 
well justified in accepting all praise for their patient and necessarily 
arduous labor." — Philadelphia Telegraph, 

" I do not see how it can ever be, or need be, superseded. It 
is advisable to have a complete and scholarly Poe ; and such we 
may emphatically call this edition." — Pro/. John F. Oenung, 
Amherst. 

"Will be a joy to the lovers of this unique American poet."— 
Washington Times. 

"A great advance over all former editions."— T^c Churchman. 

"Iieaves almost nothing unsaid concerning the poet and his 
works. So complete and handy an edition of an author is rarely 
found." — Chicago Record- Herald. 

"The * Biography ' which occupies the first volume of Professor 
Harrison's elaborate new edition of Poe is likely to remain for some 
time a standard authority for the poet's life." — Independent. 

"Will become the sUndard."— Pro/. Robert Sharpy Tulane 
University. 

"Not only a *new Poe,* but must be the final Poe, final as to 
text, biography and history. "— Pro/. William Hand Browne^ 
Johns Hopkins University. 

"Altogether the best and most complete edition of this author 
that has ever appeared. A great service to students and readers." 
— Pro/. William Lyon Phelps, Yale University.

** I have beeu reading Dr. Gray's book 

with a great delight. It breathes the 

spirit of the woods, and it is full of true 

religion. This, it seems to me, is a happy 

combination. I like Christianity best with 

an out-door flavor. The trouble with it 

usually is that we keep it too much shut

" The sign over the door ' Foors Gold ' 
is an enticing one you will say, and you 
will not meet with disappointment should 
you step over the threshold. The author 
has devised a plot that is out of the ordi- 
nary, chosen characters that are by no 
means hum-drum, and displayed an un- 
usual skill in untangling so many seem- 
ingly hopeless webs, evolving so much hap-

commendable reserve power. There is 
nothing lurid or sensational or overdrawn 
about his picture— it is simply tragic, piti- 
ful, heartrending— a page torn from the 
story of a ruined life. None of the previ- 
ous attempts is worthy of being placed in

THE CONQUEST 

'By EVA EMERY DYE 

\rO book published in recent years has more of tremendous import 
between its covers, and no book published in recent years has in 
it more of the elements of great and continued popularity. History, 
romance, adventure, daring, suffering, struggle, and accomplishment 
— the subjugation of a mighty race by a mightier one — the clearing 
of a continent, the building of a nation: it is the epic of America. 



"A book that should make record-breaking 
paces." — Buffalo Commercial. 

"The sense of the sweep of the conquering 
Anglo-Celt from the Atlantic to the Pacific will 
be gained from it as from nothing else in print." 
— Chicago Sews. 

" It is no mere picture, rather a vast pano- 
rama."— Bos/on Journal. 

" The essentially American theme dealt with 
in this book gives it an extraordinary interest for 
the whole American puhUc."— Richmond Times. 

"Should have an honored place in every 
American tihra-ry."— Chicago Inter Ocean. 

" To the young American— the boy in his teens 
— who has read of the brave Indian fighters of 
our early history, there is enough of the deeds 
of our forefathers and hairbreadth escapes to 
satisfy the craving of the most exacting."— 
SashviUe American. 



" Its deeds of valor are not for love of woman, 
but for love of liberty and country. Its heroes 
are men of silence, men of adventure. Its music 
is the hum of the spinning wheel and the thud 
of the axt."— Toledo Weekly Blade. 

"As well executed as it is well concdved." — 
Syracuse Post-Standard. 

"Mrs. Dye has covered the field."— ^^i- York 
Times. 

"The authors style is strong and graphic, 
the grasp of her subject so firm that it inspires 
confidence, and despite its wealth of historic 
lore, has not one dull page." — Detroit News. 

" The style is brilliant, dramatic and enthus- 
ing. The reader is carried on from one exciting 
episode to another, and a series of vivid pictures 
is rapidly presented, keeping the interest alive 
from the first page to the last" — Cleveland 
Plain Dealer.

SCHOULER'S 

History of the United States of America

JOHN FISKE said of it: 

" An excellent work, and it hils a place 
which no other book even pretends to till." 



Whflt is it? ■'^ critical History ol the L'nited States, niiiiuteiv and graphicallv describing the 

inner facts of her heroic colonial struggles, touching upon the organization of 

Congress, the welding together of the primitive States into one grand Nation for mutual defence 
and general welfare; the accessions of the vast territories South, West, and Northwest; the troubles 
of i8i2; the difficulties with Mexico; the Slaveiy Question, embracing the mainsprings of the 
Ci\il War and which developed the greatest armed conflict the world has ever known. 

A Supplementary Volume (the sixth) covering the Civil War has lately 
been added, and of this volume three editions have already been issued 

Schouler's History is a Solid American Hisiory, containing a series of maps, showing the 
boundaries of different periods, presenting at a glance the development and growth of the countr\ . 
This work is printed on an extra qualitv of paper in a clear cut tvpe, and bound in handsome areen 
English buckram stamped with gold, presenting an elegantlv finished appearance. 

Who wrote it? Professor James Schouler, author, educator, and eminent lawvcr, and a lect- 

urer on Law and History in two of the great universities of this countrv. 

He has spent fifteen years conscientiouslv seeking through the public and private records and librar- 
ies for these facts before a single line was written on this work. His Historv has become famous, 
and has long since been accepted as the Standard History of the period. 

Why Prepflred? ^° &'^^ ^" ^^^ .American people an authentic, comprehensive, readable 

description of this wonderful period; that colleges, universities, students — in 

fact, every home might ha\ e an unprejudiced American Historv. 



WHAT IS SAID OF IT 

Trustwortlly. "It is trustworthy, iiuercsting, ami remarkably impartial." -(.■/■«»-/(?/ £. HotvnrJ, Professor 'jf 
History, LelanJ Stanford, Jr., University. 

incomparable. "The books have so established themselves as scholarly and attractive that it would be vain lo 
compare them for the period treated with any other work in the field." — 1. C. McLaughlin, Pro- 
fessor of History, University of Michigan. 

ine Best. •• The best work covering this period. "--y. A. James, Professor of History, Cornell University. 

A Necessity. "It will be referred to by scholars who will trust it as an authority, and it will be read by the 
~^~^~'^~~~"~ citizen who wishes a clear outline of political or social events." — The Outlook.

THE POETRY OF ROBERT BROWNING 

By STOPFORD A. BROOKE, author of "Tennyson." 12mo, $1.50 net (postage, 15 cts.). 

"THIS study of the life and genius of Browning comes from a highly capable source. Mr. Brooke's previous

Browning, and an interpretation of his spirit through his poems. It will prove of great utility to the Browning 
student, and a noteworthy addition to critical literature.

SOCIAL NEW YORK UNDER

An Account of Houses, Streets, and Country Homes, with Chapters on 
Fashions, Furniture, China, Plate, and Manners. Profusely Illus- 
trated. Roval Octavo. Price, S5.00 n^/. Postage 30 cents additional. 

By ESTHER SINGLETON 

This handsome volume by ihe author of " The Furniture of Our Forefathers " will 
come to most readers as a revelation. Dealing as it does with the period when the first, second, 
and third Georges reigned over New York, it goes back to times usually thought to have been 
primitive, but in reality they were not. Here in New York existed a state of social splendor 
which, allowing for the difference in population, was not unlike that which prevailed in London. 

This period in the social history of North America has not heretofore found an historian. 
Miss Singleton has combined the hard facts of history with minor things in social and domestic 
life in a singularly happv and effective manner.

THREE SCORE AND TEN. 



Of the three giants of the North — Count 
Tolstoy, Dr. Ibsen, and Herr Bjbrnson — two 
have for several years enjoyed the septuagen- 
arian distinction, and the third is about to 
achieve that dignity. On the eighth of the 
present month, it will have been exactly seventy 
years since Bjomstjeme Bjomson was born in 
the Norwegian hamlet of Kvikne — bom into 
the simple conditions that characterize the 
household life of the country pastor, yet des- 
tined to become one of the greatest men of his 
time, and to stand in the eyes of Norwegians 
everywhere as the typical representative of 
their race. The shoulders that to-day so stur- 
dily bear their weight of years have supported 
many good causes during the past half-century, 
for they are the shoulders of one who has not 
been content to produce literature alone, but 
who " was ever a fighter " as well as a poet. 
All honor to the man who to-day adds to the 
glory of the singer and the creative artist the 
other glory of many stout battles waged for

truth and righteousness in the political, intel 
lectual, and ethical arena. 

Although no less widely known than his great 
fellow-countryman and friendly rival, Dr. Ib- 
sen, the subject of the present study has of late 
years proved less attractive as a theme for cos- 
mopolitan discussion. The questions which he 
has raised have not had quite the poignant vi- 
tality, or have not borne quite so directly upon 
the interests of the moment, as have those 
raised by Dr. Ibsen ; the name of the latter 
has, in consequence, more frequently engaged 
the pen of the journalist. But this fact seems 
to represent only a passing phase of critical 
activity. That the future will redress the bal- 
ance of public interest is hardly to be doubted. 
Herr Bjornson enjoyed many years of cosmo- 
politan fame before the name of his older 
contemporary had awakened other than faint 
echoes abroad, and, although as a dramatist 
alone his merits may be weighed (and perhaps 
found wanting) in comparison with those of Dr. 
Ibsen, it must be remembered that the fame of 
the great novelist is also his, and, added to that, 
the distinction of being supreme among the 
lyrists of his nation. 

Herr Bjornson's work was introduced to the 
English public by Mary Howitt, who in 1858 
(the year after its original publication) made a 
free translation of " Synnbve Solbakken," and 
published it in England, with a changed title, 
and without mention of the author's name. 
It was not long, however, before the name also 
became known, when translations of the other 
peasant idyls were made during the following 
few years. But in spite of this early introduc- 
tion to English readers, Herr Bjornson has not 
fared very well at the hands of translators, and 
the English public still has a very inadequate 
and one-sided idea of his work. Most people 
continue to think of him as the author of the 
simple stories by which he first became known 
to us, and few realize in what manifold other 
directions his activities have been developed. 
His lyrical genius must forever remain un- 
known to those who cannot read his language, 
for song is always untranslatable, but there is 
no reason why his work in fiction and the 
drama, in all its phases, should not become the 
possession of all English readers. Most of the 
fiction has, as we believe, been translated into 
English, but the two great productions of his 
later years have not been included in either of 
the two uniform collections, and their transla- 
tions have appeared in so furtive a fashion that 
few readers are aware of their existence. These 



two modern novels, " There Are Flags in City 
and Harbor " (called " The Heritage of the 
Kurts " in its English version), and " In God's 
Ways," are among the most important produc- 
tions of modern Continental fiction. The sec- 
ond of them, in particular, is a moving picture 
of life which is equal if not superior to the best 
work of Count Tolstoy, having the same quali- 
ties of simple sincerity and truthfulness com- 
bined with an even finer literary art. 

The dramatic work of Herr Bjornson can 
hardly be said to be known to our public at 
all, although it might be set in the balance 
with the work of Dr. Ibsen with some doubt as 
to the direction in which the scale would tip. 
" Sigurd Slembe " alone, the greatest of the 
earlier works, exists in a volume uniform with 
American translation of the tales ; of the other 
plays, early and late, some four or five have 
been put forward sporadically, and are prac- 
tically inaccessible. The first part of "Over 
JEjvne" recently produced upon the English 
stage with such impressive beauty by Mrs. 
Patrick Campbell, may be had in a version 
called " Paster Sang," and the last of the plays, 
" Laboremus," may be found in a recent issue 
of " The Fortnightly Review." Those who ran- 
sack the files of " Poet-lore " may find therein 
a translation of " A Glove," and we also re- 
member to have come aCrdss' obscurely pub- 
lished translations of "The Newly- Wedded 
Pair" and of "Mary Stuart in -Scotland." 
But "The King," and several other master- 
pieces of Herr Bjornson's second period, have 
never, as far as we know, been put into En- 
glish. Surely, the man who must rank among 
the half dozen greatest writers living at the 
beginning of the twentieth century has de- 
served something better than this haphazard 
sort of translation. 

It will be realized from the foregoing re- 
marks that to be familiar with " Arne " and 
" The Fisher Maiden," and to have a vivid re- 
collection of " Beyond Human Power " as pre- 
sented on the stage by Mrs. Campbell is to be 
very far from knowing the colossal and sym- 
pathetic figure who for over forty years has 
stood at the head of Scandinavian literature. 
At the very least, one must know in addition 
such works as " Sigurd Slembe," " The King," 
and " In God's Ways." And one should also 
know,Jbesides Herr Bjornson's principal books, 
something of his manifold activities as poli- 
tician and orator, as social theorist and apostle 
of liberal thought. And in all these aspects of 
his career it must be remembered that he ex-

hibits the dUtinctive stamp of his nationality. 
What Dr. Brandes says upon this subject has 
often been quoted, bat may be quoted once 
more as a fitting close to these remarks. " To 
name the name of Bjornson is like hoisting the 
Norwegian flag. In his merits and his faults, 
his genius and his weakness, he is as distinctly 
national as Voltaire or Schiller. Free-spoken as 
a, man, laconic as an artist, touchily patriotic,and 
at the same time vividly conscious of his na- 
tion's narrow-mindedness, its spiritual poverty 
and needs — a consciousness that has impelled 
him to Scandinavism, Teutonism. cosmopoli- 
tanism, — this peculiar mingling of qualities is 
80 typically national that Bjornson in his own 
person comprehends the nation." And now, 
apon the occasion of his seventieth birthday, 
with the plaudits of the nation that proudly 
claims him for her own, there are mingled the 
plaudits of the whole cosmopolitan world of let- 
ters, won and=ridaiy deserved by the sheer force 
of the genius that makes him to-day among the 
foremost spokesmen of humankind. 



THE CUB RENT NEGLECT OF POETS ¥. 



While we properly choose to think of poetry as 
Bomething more than a marketable commodity, and 
do not, under the best conditions, expect it to gain 
a wide circle of immediate castomers, we can hardly 
look upon the unmarketableneu of current Amer- 
ican verse without wonder. It is true, of course, 
that the fact holds good with regard to other forma 
of teUes lettres. The creative essay of the old dis- 
ernnre type, and the modern logical easay in liter- 
ary criticism, are in their purer form almost equally 
impertinent to the conscious needs even of the bet- 
ter public But this is less difficult to understand ; 
for poetry, we must think, is capable of more direct 
appeal to our primary impulses, and should there- 
fore be avoided with less ease, no matter how in- 
different to the idea of poetry we may be. In its 
simplest aspect of '• emotional rhythmic utterance," 
it continues, as Professor Gnmmere has pointed out, 
to g^in some reward in the newspaper and on the 
vaudeville stage. But the audience thus appealed to 
is not the audience of which we can expect support 
for any one of the fine arts ; and it is of poetry in 
its character of fine art, and of its present neglect 
by the limited audience upon which it might seem, 
in that character, to possess some claim. Uiat I am 
here s{>eakiDg. 

How far is this charge of indifference justified 
by the facts? Surely, one reflects, a good many 
volumes of verse, — as many as thirty or forty in 
America alone, — are published every year ; and 
the publisher, with all his failings, does not throw 
away money. Upon what terms does he make him- 



self responsible for these books? Very seldom, it 
should be said at once, apoa the terms which would 
govern the publication of an average novel, say. 
The publisher rarely pays the whole cost, and when 
he does, unless the verse possesses some catch- 
penny quality, hardly looks for a profit. Usually 
the expense is shared, the larger part falling upon 
the author. Not infrequently the author pays the 
whole cost, simply receiving the advantage of the im- 
print of some respectable publishing-house. Among 
a certain class of publishers, too, it is a matter of 
policy to get out a new book of verse now and then. 
Poetry is an item which ought not to be entirely 
absent from the list of forthcoming books ; and the 
publisher is willing to pay the piper rather than have 
it supposed that nobody is piping. 

It is not a very high-priced form of advertising, 
— or, to be charitable, not an over-strenuous act of 
piety. An edition of two or three hundred copies 
of the ordinary book of verse is quite likely to glut 
the market ; and the expense of the plates is not 
great Not long ago a volume of verse was put 
forth by a well-known house, and received with un- 
usual favor by the critics and the public. In the 
course of six months or so a new edition was an- 
Boaneed with some trumpeting. One had visions of 
aabstantial returns to the lucky poet as well as the 
glory of a wide audience for his work, and might 
have been surprised to learn that the first edition 
consisted of seven hundred copies. That was a 
rare success. Under these conditions, it is not sur- 
prising that there is now an increasing tendency on 
the part of verse-writers of refinement to have their 
work privately printed. A hundred copies can be 
pretty cheaply produced, and readily taken care of 
by the old-fashioned method of subscription. That 
was a thrifty method ; if one's bantling is to be cast 
into the waters, it is certainly more discreet to fur- 
nish a life-belt. But the principle is vicious, after 
alL If poetry is a fine art, there is no apparent 
reason why the poetic product should not '"exploit" 
itself upon even terms with any other fine-art prod- 
uct ; and say what we will about the independence 
of the artist, we cannot feel that he gains in dignity 
by assuming the methods of the amateur. When 
the poet has once fairly admitted that his product 
is unmerchantable, and has declined to put it to the 
test, he has cast suspicion upon its value. No work 
of art gains by fond handling ; it must take its 
chances in the open field. 

The chances will of course be against its achiev- 
ing a success of the first order. We may think of 
poetry in the highest sense as a product the quality 
of which approaches an absolute standard. But 
poetry of this quality must in the nature of things 
be extremely rare ; while every age has produced a 
quantum of verse to which, though it lacks that 
supreme excellence, we cannot sensibly deny the 
title of poetry. There is, in fact, a broader aspect 
of poetic achievement which does not leave us quite 
so free to deal in extremes of judgment. From 
this point of view, '■ Shakespeare or nothing " must 



886 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



cease to be the f ormnla by which we can dispose of 
the problem of contemporary verse. Believing with 
Aristotle that poetry is one of the imitative or cre- 
ative arts whose end is pleasure, we mast also be- 
lieve that this pleasure must be capable of marked 
variations in degree if not in kind. We do not de- 
mand that every painting or statue should be a 
masterpiece in order to gain our approbation. If 
the current product in any art is seen to be treated 
with indifference by any people or age, the obvious 
inference would be that the product is inferior, or 
that the public taste is degenerate, or both. An- 
other inference, somewhat less obvious, but, I think, 
especially worthy of consideration in forming a 
judgment of our own attitude toward poetry, would 
be that such indifference indicates a general misap- 
prehension of the significance of this patient and 
little rewarded pursuit of poetry which we know to 
be always going on. Not only as a means for ex- 
pressing spontaneous emotion (and of coarse it must 
always be that), but as a fine art, poetry continues 
to appeal to a small but steadfast element in our 
society which the comic papers laugh at and the 
sober authorities condescend to. 

Let me say here that I take no more interest in 
the pursuit of poetry for art's sake than for the sake 
of sociologry. The ambling sentiment of the popular 
poet and the precious phrasing of the high-voiced 
literary poet are equally beside the mark. Neither 
sincerity nor prettiness can by themselves compass 
poetic beauty; the partial, the trite, the finicking, 
are as fatal in poetry as in sculpture or painting. 
One may fancy an advantage to minor work in those 
arts from the comparative inaccessibility of the great 
masterpieces. That would not hold true of music; 
but there, as in painting, beauty makes its appeal 
through one of the outer senses, while poetry, how- 
ever perfect its form, bestows its full loveliness only 
apon the inward ear, as sculpture communicates its 
fall perfection only to the inward eye. The painter 
and the composer of no more than ordinary powers 
are often able by simple manipulations to impress 
effects confusingly suggestive of greatness, upon an 
audience whose mood is commonly of sensuous 
susceptibility rather than of pure and intelligent 
sympathy. The luxury of this mood partly accounts 
for the immense and increasing encouragement given 
by England and America to a department of fine 
art in which they have actually achieved far less of 
moment than in poetry. English poetry as a whole 
is as far superior to German poetry as English 
music is inferior to German music. 

The analogy between poetry and the sister arts 
must not be pushed too far. The real barrier which 
intervenes is suggested by the fact that we can 
hardly imagine the profitableness of establishing 
national or private schools of the poetic art. At the 
same time it is a little indolent of us to lie back 
upon the theory that poets are born, not made. 
The poet must be born with the aptitude, yes ; but 
then the aptitude must be developed. He does not 
need the viva voce method ; of necessity, the library 



will be his class-room and the high-way his studio. 
Poets are not born equal, and their work, if it is to 
endure, must be the outcome of hard discipline and 
a settled philosophy of life, as well as of the mys- 
terious glow and vigor of fancy which we call in- 
spiration. 

There is little use in plaintive talk about the 
public. People who could conceivably take a live 
interest in poetry as a fine art must be few. But 
there are a good many millions of us in America ; 
and there are, after all reservations have been made, 
an uncertain number of thousands who really possess 
and take pleasure in cultivating a sense, rudimen- 
tary at least, for artistic value. They like, or wish 
to like, good paintings, good music, good sculpture 
and architecture; and they feel a sort of responsi- 
bility for the support of those arts. I am wishing 
to inquire here if a similar sense of interest and re- 
sponsibility in our immediate poetic product may 
not be in the future both proper and cultivable.

COMMUNICA TION. 



PROFESSOR LADD'S " PHILOSOPHY OP CONDUCT." 
(To the Editor of Thb Diai..) 

It would doubtless be unreasonable to expect that so 
elaborate a work as my "Philosophy of Conduct" 
should receive adequate treatment in so brief a notice 
as your journal chose to give, in your issue of Nov. 1 
last. But no critical notice of any book, however brief 
such notice may be, can be absolved from the obligation 
to state the main positions of the book it criticises, in 
an intelligible and truthful manner. This the reviewer 
in The Dial utterly failed to do. And since the book 
treats of Morality, my interest in its positions and in 
their fair presentation is something more and higher 
than a selfish personal interest. I therefore ask your 
permission in few words to state to your readers what 
those positions are. 

In this book I have aimed to show, and I think that 
I have conclusively shown, the truth of the following 
three propositions : First, the study of man's ethical 
opinions and of his actual conduct, when pursued merely 
by the empirical method, leaves all the fundamental 
problems of ethics in darkness and confusion. As re- 
spects its side of feeling, man's moral consciousness, 
when viewed from the psychological and the evolution- 
ary points of view, appears in irreconcilable conflict. 
As respects judgment and thought, it is found always 
involved in confusion. Man's conceptions of the sanc- 
tions, the fitting rewards, and ideals of conduct can 
neither be explained nor defended solely on the basis 
of his past or present experience. To state and, by a 
prolonged investigation of the facts, to prove this posi- 
tion is the merit of a work on ethics ; if, as I hold the 
case to be, tho facts, and not the author, must be held 
responsible for the failure of empiricism to clear up the 
subject. 

Second: When we inquire, with a broad understand- 
ing of human nature and a wide and sympathetic sur- 
vey of man's moral development, What is the nature of 
this ideal of conduct, whose sanctions seem to man im- 
perative, but whose image changes with all the changes 



1902.] 



THE DIAL

in tbe caltare and social environment of the iodiyidnal? 
The answer can be given by philosophy. It is not 
merely, or chiefly, an ideal of comfortable living, or of 
80-calied happiness, whether for the individual or for the 
race. Neither is it the ideal of perfect conformity to 
an impersonal, but so-called moral law. It is rather 
the ideal of an individual, functioning as a person in an 
environment of other persons, i. e., in a social organism. 
Here again, if this ideal can be only somewhat vaguely 
described, or imperfectly sketched, this, too, is not the 
fault of the author. It is the excellence of tbe ideal, 
which is ever in the state of evolution — rising, expand- 
ing, and alluring man onward. Who shall describe 
with hard and finished outlines, the ideal person in 
social relations, under the existing conditions of man's 
total environment? 

But, third, the origin, the nature, the sanctions, the 
effectiveness, of this ideal, and especially the history of 
its unfolding in the spirit of the race, call for an 
explanation which lies beyond the anthropological or 
social point of new. This explanation must be found 
where the best of the race have always been inclined 
to find it, — viz., in the postulate of that Ethical Spirit 
as the Ground of the world and of hnmanity, whom 
faith calls God. 

In one word, just as I have shown, with tbe most 
faithful regard for facts and the strictest application 
of scientific method, in my two preceding books, "Phil- 
osophy of Knowledge" and "A Theory of Reality," 
that God is the Ground of all we know in science, so I 
have shown in " The Philosophy of Conduct," that God 
is the Ground of all we approve and strive to attain in 
conduct. Respectful consideration shall always be 
shown by me to any critic who, with a small fraction 
of the same regard for facts and for the scientific 
method, challenges these views. But for a critic who, 
like tbe writer of the notice in The Dial, makes no 
semblance of any effort even truthfully to present the 
views he criticizes, but promptly retreats to the cheap 
and antiquated appeal to the odium, anti-theologicum, 
what respectful consideration can any one be asked to 



hare?

[If a reviewer writing for a jonrnal of literary 
criticism should attempt to state, in a single article, 
the main positions of six treatises on ethics, he would 
lay upon tbe readers of tbe joarnal a burden which 
no editor, however compliant, would permit him to 
impose. All that can be demanded of such a re- 
viewer, therefore, is that whatever material he 
gelects for presentation shall be described with a 
scrupulous regard for truth. How far I succeeded 
in my endeavor to follow this principle in my notice 
of Professor Ladd's •• Philosophy of Conduct "' is a 
subject I can hardly discuss in these columns for 
want of the requisite space. It seems, however, 
the less necessary because nothing in the author's 
own statement of his position, as given above, con- 
tradicts in the slightest degree my interpretation of 
his views. My criticism of Professor Ladd's con- 
clusions was not intended to be an argued discussion 
of their truth. It was simply a brief and therefore 
dogmatically formulated statement of the judgment 
which a conscientious study of the book had left in 
my mind. — The Reviewkr.]

A XOTEWORTHY AFTERMATH.* 



Either as lectures, after-dinner addresses, or 
magazine articles, most if not all of the brief 
studies by the late John Fiske, now collected 
in two stout octavos by his widow and executrix, 
have already been presented to the pnblic. The 
repeated delivery of the greater number of 
them before intelligent audiences in all parts 
of the country has insured them a finish and 
symmetry too often lacking in a collection of 
posthumous miscellanies. This, too, may ac- 
count for a certain tendency to colloquialism, 
now and then apparent, more suitable to the 
spoken address than to the printed essay. Not 
that one would have it otherwise, however ; for 
such idiosyncrasies of a gifted author who was 
so suddenly and so recently taken from as, are 
things to be treasured. For example, when he 
chooses, in the midst of a grave historical dis- 
cussion, to reinforce his argument with a line 
from " Pinafore," or to enliven his page with 
a stanza from " lolantbe," the reader is pleas- 
antly reminded of the writer's fondness for and 
proficiency in music. 

The nine chapters of the first volume, as 
Mrs. Fiske's introductory note tells us, were to 
have been incorporated in a larger work, " A 
History of the American People," had the au- 
thor lived to execute the plan. They are ar- 
ranged in chronological order, from Governor 
Hutchinson to Daniel Webster. But being 
special studies, biographical and political, they 
want the historical perspective that would 
doubtless have characterized the completed 
work. That they are all intensely interesting 
follows as a necessity from their authorship. 
The enthusiasm with which the writer throws 
himself into his subject cannot but carry the 
reader along with him, a willing captive. The 
much-maligned Thomas Hutchinson becomes a 
hero and a martyr. The weak and shifty 
Charles Lee figures as too despicable a charac- 
ter even to gain admittance to the company of 
those consigned to eternal torment. Our ad- 
miration for Hamilton we follow up with hardly 
less applause for his foeman, Jefferson. Madi- 
son. Jackson, Harrison, Tyler, Webster, — each 
is shown to have contributed his share toward 
strengthening the Union, as no other man be-

fore or since could have done. Even Webster's 
"seventh of March" speech is warmly de- 
fended. The plea is the one almost invariably 
■used by his biographers, — that no other atti- 
tude was possible for a statesman whose gov- 
erning motive was the preservation of the 
Union. In a certain sense Webster's course 
was defensible, because from his point of view 
it was the only one open. But after all is said, 
he who excuses accuses ; and it must ever be 
cause for regret that no higher motive prevailed 
that day than expediency. 

A bit of new and apparently trustworthy 
testimony is brought forward, in the chapter 
on " Charles Lee, the Soldier of Fortune," to 
settle the vexed question as to the language 
used by Washington at Monmouth toward his 
faithless lieutenant. By a Virginian who heard 
the story from Major Jacob Morton of Cum- 
berland County, who himself witnessed the 
whole occurrence, it is emphatically denied that 
anything worthy to be called profanity was in- 
dulged in on that occasion. Major Mortou's 
reported account of the event is too good to 
mutilate by imperfect quotat'on. He says: 

" I will tell you how it was. Our troops were march- 
ing rapidly, expecting soon to be engaged with the 
British ; the day was very hot, the road heavy with sand, 
our men fatigued by the march. I was then a sergeant 
in my company and had frequently to face about in 
order to keep my platoon aligned on the march, — my- 
self walking backwards. While doing so, I saw General 
Washington coming from the rear of our column, riding 
very rapidly along the right flank of the column ; and 
as he came nearer, my attention was fixed upon him 
with wonder and astonishment, for he was evidently 
under strong emotion and excitement. I never saw 
such a countenance before. It was like a thunder-cloud 
before the Hash of lightning. Just as he reached the 
flank of my platoon he reined up his horse a little, and 
raising his right hand high above his head, he cried out 
with a loud voice, 'My God! General Lee, what are 
you about?' Until that moment I had not known that 
General Lee was near ; but on turning my head a little 
to the left (still stepping backward on the march) I 
found that General Lee had ridden from the head of 
our column along our right flank and was only a few 
yards distant, in front of General Washington. In 
answer to General Washington's excited exclamation, 
' My God I General Lee, what are you about ? ' General 
Lee began to make some explanation ; but General 
Washington impatiently interrupted him, and with his 
hand still raised high above his head, waving it angrily, 
exclaimed, ' Go to the rear, sir,' spurred his horse, and 
rode lapidly forward. The whole thing occurred as 
quickly as I can tell it to you." 

The second volume embraces themes of va- 
ried interest. The " Reminiscences of Huxley " 
show the author in his most genial mood. Of 
Spencer, too, and Tyndall he gives us pleasant 
recollections. " Herbert Spencer's Service to 



Religion " pricks the curiosity by its very title. 
" Evolution and the Present Age " is a bit of 
cosmic philosophy for popular consumption. 
" Koshchei the Deathless " supplements the 
author's " Myths and Myth-makers." A sym- 
pathetic study of Milton illustrates Dr. Fiske's 
breadth of reading and also his fine ear for all 
that is musical in verse. 

In the chapter on Huxley occurs, among 
other good stories, the following version of the 
" Soapy Sam " incident, which will serve to 
relieve the tedium of this review. The author 
received the account from his friend Youmans. 

<■ It was at the meeting of the British Association 
at Oxford in 18C0, soon after the publication of Dar- 
win's epoch-making book, and while people in general 
were wagging their heads at it, that the subject came 
up for discussion before a fashionable and hostile au- 
dience. Samuel Wilberforce, the plausible and self- 
complacent Bishop of Oxford, commonly known as 
' Soapy Sam,' launched out in a rash speech, conspicu- 
ous for its ignorant misstatements, and highly seasoned 
with appeals to the prejudices of the audience, upon 
whose lack of intelligence the speaker relied. Near 
him sat Huxley, already eminent as a man of science, 
and known to look favorably upon Darwinism, but more 
or less youthful withal, only five-and-thirty, so that the 
bishop anticipated sport in badgering him. At the 
close of his speech he suddenly turned upon Huxley and 
begged to be informed if the learned gentleman was 
really willing to be regarded as the descendant of a 
monkey. Eager self-confidence had blinded the bishop 
to the tactical blunder in thus coarsely inviting a retort. 
Huxley was instantly upon his feet with a speech de- 
molishing the bishop's card-house of mistakes ; and at 
the close he observed that since a question of personal 
preference bad been very improperly brought into the 
discussion of scientific theory, he felt free to confess 
that if the alternatives were descent, on the one hand, 
from a respectable monkey, or on the other from a 
bishop of the English Church who could stoop to such 
misrepresentations and sophisms as the audience had 
lately listened to, he should declare in favor of the 
monkey ! " 

The author hastens to add that this surely can- 
not have been what Huxley said or how he said 
it. But from the fact that he was loudly ap- 
plauded, and that in the ensuing excitement 
one lady fainted and had to be carried out, it is 
safe to infer that the scientist gave the church- 
man a Roland for his Oliver. However, to the 
credit of our human nature be it added, the 
bishop carried away no bitterness from this en- 
counter, but was ever afterward most courteous 
to his castigator. 

The title-page of the first volume bears 
the favorite motto of the tireless student and 
worker, the same that he had inscribed over the 
hearth in his library, — the monkish injunction, 
" Study as if for Life Eternal, live prepared to 
die tomorrow." On opening the second vol-

ame, we find another equally apt qaotation, ' 
this time from Goethe, — '• If thou wonldst \ 
press into the infinite, go out to all parts of the 
finite." The occurrence of some absurd mis- 
prints is doubtless attributable to the lack of an 
author's care in proof-revision. For instance, 
our old friend Elijah Pogram appears trans- ' 
mo^rified as Elijah Pagram ; and on page 17 
of Vol. II. we are informed that "the Italians 
have a pithy proverb, Si non e vero e hen,

English." It does indeed. But heaven for- 
give us for thus making a scholar turn in his

The Book of the CorBTiER.* 



It is curious that from the time of the third 
impression (1742) of the third English trans- 
lation of U Cortegiano, there should have 
been no English imprint until 1900. aud then 
three new editions within a twelvemonth. Sir 
Thomas Hoby's Elizabethan translation, ap- 
propriately edited by Walter Raleigh, and the 
Essex House edition of the same, with woodcut 
ornaments by Mr. C. R. Ashbee, came oat in 
1900. This last is an artistic piece of work, 
but it is surpassed by " The Book of the 
Courtier." translated anew into English by 
Mr. Leonard Eckstein Opdycke. and superbly 
printed by the De Vinne Press. Beyond doabt, 
Mr. Opdycke's beautiful book is the most not- 
able event of the last year in American book- 
making. Bound in fall vellam, and stamped 
in gold with the seal of Castiglione specially 
designed for the front cover by Mr. Kenyon 
Cox, and containing seventy-one portraits of 
Renaissance personages printed in tone by Mr. 
Edward Bierstadt, the book is a delight to the 
eye. The printing, too, is worthy of its beaa- 
tiful setting ; type, ink, paper, and impression 
being carefully adapted to produce the most 
harmonious effect. It is of interest to compare 
the typography of the De Vinne Press in this 
book with the Golden type invented by William 
Morris, and used by him for the first time in 
printing '• The Story of the Glittering Plain." 
The De Vinne type, " old-style antique," is not 
new, but it is rarely seen as here, printed on 
pure c-otton-rag paper, soft in texture and color.

Foar different sizes of the type are used, for 
text, notes, and indices ; bat the utmost sym- 
metry prevails among them, and there is a total 
absence of the Morris mannerisms of the Gt)l- 
den type, of jammed lines and close spacing, 
Mr. De Vinne has produced a letter-press that 
is at once beaatifnl to look at, and restful to 
read. 

Surely if any book ever deserved to be 
brought out in sumptuous style, it is II Cor- 
legiano. Apart from the trecentisti, it is 
a question whether any book of any Italian 
writer has been printed more times, or en- 
joyed a more enduring popularity, than " The 
Courtier." Mr. Opdycke's edition is the 
fourth £Ds:lish translation, and the one bun- 
dred and forty-fourth impression of this cele- 
brated book. It contains a list of former 
editions, which is a valuable and complete bib- 
liography as far as it is now known ; but it is 
worth while to note that the list does not in- 
clude a second Spanish translation, mentioned 
by Giuseppe Rigutini in his Florentine edition 
(18!i9), nor a possible Russian translation re- 
ferred to by Lodovico Corio (Milan edition, 
1890). First printed in 1628, II Cortegiano 
began its world career with the translation of 
the Spanish poet, Bosesa ; translations into 
French, German, Latin and English rapidly 
followed, and of the one hundred and three 
editions that appeared before the death of 
Queen Elizabeth, forty-six, or almost one-half, 
were in foreign languages, — a truly remark- 
able showing. 

Mr. Opdycke's translation takes rank at 
once beside the first one, and that is high 
praise, for the Elizabethan translation, made 
in 1561, remains to this day a most readable 
and interesting book. Sir Thomas Hoby, the 
first English translator, was an " Italianated " 
Englishman, a little later than the Earl of Sur- 
rey and Sir Thomas Wyatt, and a little earlier 
than Sir Philip Sidney, who best of English- 
nien embodied the ideal of ■' The Courtier." 
He was, Roger Ascham says, " very expert in 
knowledge of divers tongues," he had been an 
Italian traveller, and he died Elizabeth's am- 
bassador to France. 

In Hoby's time the translator was not con- 
fronted with Mr. Opdycke's problem, how best 
to reader an old classic. The Elizabethans had 
a vigorous English, just rising into conscious- 
ness, and they were blessed with unlimited 
confidence in themselves. These conditions, 
added to great intellectual curiosity and much 
sympathy, result in a picturesque directness of

[Dec. 1, 



touch which is a common characteristic of the 
Elizabethan translators from the Italian. Mr. 
Opdycke meets the difficulty of a changed point 
of view and expanded English most cleverly. 
His translation of Castiglione's Italian is clear, 
fluent, and graceful ; not archaic English, nor 
yet the English of the market-place. It has 
a certain reserve, a certain stateliness, befit- 
ting the book and the subject. We miss in 
the nineteenth-century English the homely 
strength of such phrases of Sir Thomas Hoby's 
as " to slepe in a whole skynne," " pecke of 
troubles," " not a farthynge left to blesse him- 
self e " [with], but Mr. Opdycke's very modern 
" stand to win " (p. 101) for venire del fare is 
accurate almost to intuition. Perfectly correct, 
but not so good, is "foresight [^la prudenzia'] 
which consists in a certain judgment in choos- 
ing well " (p. 258), and " whoever knows how 
to command is always obeyed " (p. 265). The 
Elizabethan English packs the thought here. 
"Wisdome," says Hoby, "consisteth in a cer- 
tain judgment to choose well," while " He that 
can commaunde is alwayes obeyed " is fairly im- 
perative. By a curious oversight, Mr. Opdycke 
has omitted to mention anywhere the original 
Italian text from which he translated. But his 
notes show it to have been the scholarly edition 
of Vittorio Cian (Florence, 1894), with an oc- 
casional reading from other texts, notably that 
of the very correctly printed Aldine folio of 
1545. One of these Aldine accuracies removes 
a stumbling-block from the pathway of most of 
the Italian editors ; it is " una licentia Brae- 
ciesca," in the lively scene at the close of the 
second evening's conversation, when "at a sig- 
nal from my lady Duchess, many of the ladies 
rose to their feet, and all ran laughing towards 
my lord Gaspar, as if to shower blows upon 
him." Braccesque leave is leave with blows, 
from the name of a violent soldier, Braccio 
Fortebracci. 

" The best book that ever was written upon 
good breeding, II Cortegiano, by Castiglione, 
grew up at the little Court of Urbino, and you 
should read it," says Dr. Johnson to Boswell. 
It is neither here nor there that Dr. Johnson 
had probably never read Jl Cortegiano him- 
self, for it is not a book on good breeding, 
not a courtesy-book at all. With this correc- 
tion, the dictum holds good. II Cortegiano is 
absolutely the best book on manners that has 
ever been written. The Italians of the Renais- 
sance boldly aimed at perfection ; and that Cas- 
tiglione himself felt that in all human sort he 
had attained it in his book, the noble sentence 



at the close of his Dedicatory Letter to the 
Bishop of Viseu shows. 

"And if ray censors be not satisfied with the com- 
mon verdict of opinion, let them rest content with that 
of time, which in the end reveals the hidden defects of 
everything, and being father of truth and judge without 
passion, ever passes on men's writings just sentence of 
life or death." 

If one were asked wherein consists the per- 
fection of II Cortegiano, the answer might be, 
that it is one of those books, not too numerous 
in any age or language, in which the style suits 
the subject. It is a large subject, a subject of 
infinite variety, — the education of a gentle- 
man, — treated in a broad, philosophical, em- 
inently human way. Somewhat also of the 
unique excellence of II Cortegiano results 
from the fact that it is the work of a life, prac- 
tically the " sole heir of the author's invention." 
Whatever Castiglione had known and expe- 
rienced and thought and felt, he set down, 
refined and philosophized, in his book. Ac- 
cording to his own statement, the book was just 
twenty years in the making ; it came to the light 
at last a few months only before his death. 

Baldassare Castiglione was a man of noble 
birth; he had been a soldier, winning his spurs 
in the defeat of his family, the Gonzaghe, by 
the Great Captain, at Garigliano ; he was a 
distinguished diplomat, one of the earliest ex- 
amples of the diplomatist as man of letters ; 
he had travelled widely and knew the best 
people everywhere. When he died, as Apos- 
tolic Nuncio of Pope Clement VII. to Charles 
v., the Emperor is reported to have said, " I 
tell you one of the finest gentlemen in the 
world is dead." The interlocutors of the four 
evenings' conversations were all included in 
the circle of the author's friends and acquaint- 
ances, and all of them were personages. Nor 
are they brought together fortuitously, for the 
purposes of the dialogue. Castiglione had 
actually known them at " the little Court of 
Urbino," either as fellow-members of that 
courtly society, or as guests of the Duke and 
Duchess or Urbino. Their names read like 
a roll of honor of the late Italian Renaissance : 
Giuliano de' Medici, called the Magnifico, son 
of Lorenzo de' Medici and brother to Pope 
Leo X.; Ottaviano Fregoso, Doge of Genoa; 
Count Lodovico of Canossa ; Cardinals Bembo 
and Bibbiena; Giovan Cristoforo Romano: 
the author's kinswoman, Elizabetta Gonzaga, 
Duchess of Urbino ; and the witty Lady Emilia 
Pia, Countess of Montefeltro, and descendant 
of the poet Boiardo. 

As a record of manners, II Cortegiano may

THE DIAL 



391 



be said to sam up the Renaissance, at the same 
time that it anticipates the best ideals of mod- 
ern times. As is well known, it is a mixed 
type of manners that Castiglione describes, in 
that the education of letters of the Renaissance 
is engrafted upon the military discipline of 
feudal times. The Courtier is chi valric, learned, 
gentle, aesthetic. Castiglione's classical train- 
ing, his wide experience, his philosophical bent, 
together with an almost perfect openness of 
mind, perhaps the finest trait of the Italians of 
the Renaissance, combine to give his book a 
character that is at once universal and curiously 
modern. U Cortegiano is full of wise thoughts, 
— "fine things said unintentionally," as Keats 
said of Shakespeare's sonnets. " War is bad 
in itself" has been most vigorously said by one 
of the greatest soldiers of our own time. "I 
have known very few men of merit who did 
not love and honor women." Mr. Howells tells 
OS that when he went to call on Lowell, shortly 
before undertaking the Venetian consulate, the 
poet gave him two charges in parting, "to 
open his mouth when he began to speak Italian, 
and to think well of women. He said our race 
spoke its own tongue with its teeth shut, and 
so failed to master the languages that wanted 
freer utterance. As to women, he said there 
were unworthy ones, but a good woman was 
the best thing in the world, and a man was 
always the better for honoring women." 

Nowhere is the modernity of H Cortegiano 
more striking than in Castiglione's conception 
of the power and range and beneficence of the 
womanly influence in the world. The Court 
lady is the subject of the third evening's con- 
versation, conducted by the Magnifieo as the 
avowed defender of woman. He fashions her 
so liberally, imagining such a bright, sweet, 
brave creature, possessing "the knowledge of 
all things in the world," " together with the 
virtues that so seldom times are seen in men," 
that one of the gentlemen wonders why he will 
not have women to rule cities, to make laws, 
and to lead armies, while men stand spinning 
in the kitchen. The Magnifieo replies, smiling, 
" Perhaps this too were not amiss. Do yon 
not know that Plato, who indeed was not very 
friendly to women, giveth them the overseeing 
of cities? " The literary form oill Cortegiano, 
the social dialogue, in which women take part 
on equal terms with men, is a natural develop- 
ment of the ideas of the Renaissance on the 
position of women. It is conversation as a fine 
art. " Conversation,"' says Guazzo, in Xa Civil 
Convergatione, " is the beginning and the end 



of all knowledge." II Cortegiano is but the 
best of a series of similar books on social ethics 
whose one purpose was to promote friendly re- 
lations between men and women, for the better- 
ment of both. If women were to converse with 
men as equals, it followed logically that they 
must be as well educated as men. The concfu- 
sion of the conversation on the Court lady, in 
which all agree, is that she deserved well to be 
esteemed the Courtier's equal. It is admitted 
that she has a right to exist for herself. Nature 
made her a woman, with powers to be devel- 
oped, a mind to cultivate, and work in the 
world to do, which, by the grace of Grod, may 
or may not be tUtf cc«' c fio (all church and 
children). All this sounds very modem. But 
Castiglione came just at the end of the Middle 
Ages, and some of his men friends were still 
devoted to that singular idea of domestic hap- 
piness which locked the wife in with her dul- 
ness, while the husband went abroad " for to 
see, and eke for to be seen," as the rebellious 
Wife of Bath puts it. The mediaeval and mod- 
em strike sharp on each other in the discus- 
sion of love. When the Magnifieo expresses 
the opinion that love is proper for unmarried 
women only, Messer Federico Fregoso thinks 
him " austere," while Roberto da Bari jeers at 
the " rusticity " of wives loving their own hus- 
bands. The women that Castiglione knew, and 
knew well, were Yittoria Colonna, Emilia Pia, 
Fleonora of Aragon, Duchess of Ferrara, and 
their set. Friendship on equal terms with 
women like these, all as able as they were bril- 
liant, must have shaped his ideas of women, 
the most liberal that is to be found in any 
literature before Shakespeare's women. Mr. 
Opdycke, who is everywhere a sympathetic 
translator, describes Eleonora of Aragon as a 
woman of " rare merit, manly courage, and en- 
lightened culture." She was the mother of two 
daughters, Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan, 
at whose Court Castiglione was educated ; and 
of Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua, 
perhaps the most interesting woman of the Re- 
naissance. 

Isabella d'Este's portrait, after Titian, is the 
most brilliant of the many beautiful pictures 
which enrich Mr. Opdycke's translation of 
// Cortegiano. It is a veritable triumph of 
process printing, but Mr. Bierstadt surpasses 
even this in his frontispiece print of the Louvre 
portrait of Castiglione, by Raphael. The tech- 
nique of this print is well nigh perfect, com- 
bining as it does the accuracy and clearness 
of a good photograph, with the brilliance and

softness of tone of a mezzotint. A striking 
portrait, opposite page 149, from the National 
Gallery of Buda-Pesth, is that which for years 
has passed as a portrait, by Raphael, of the 
Ferrarese poet, Antonio Tebaldeo, but which 
Morelli and Berenson agree in identifying as 
a portrait of Raphael himself by Sebastiano 
Luciani " del Piombo." It represents a hand- 
some young man, of twenty-six or twenty-seven 
years, nobly serious in look, and richly dressed 
in black. It is the most masculine portrait of 
Raphael. 

It is impossible to close a review of Mr. Op- 
dycke's book without saying that the best of it 
is neither the quality of his translation nor its 
exquisite setting, but just the spirit of it all. 
Surely it is not insignificant that here and now 
a graduate of Harvard should have produced a 
book like this, a book that addresses itself not 
to the commercial sense, not to ideas of civic 
duty or moral enthusiasm, not even to instruc- 
tion or entertainment. Mr. Opdycke asks us 
to contemplate higher social ideals; his appeal 
is to the charm and grace of life.

The Greatest of Wood-Engravers.* 



That engraving on wood seems likely to be- 
come, like line engraving on steel, almost a 
lost art, is but the natural consequence of the 
invention and perfecting of the various pro- 
cesses of photo-mechanical reproduction. There 
are many reasons why this should be so. It is 
not only that the meclaanical processes are both 
actually and relatively cheap. The gain in lit- 
eral fidelity is indisputable ; there is no tedious 
waiting for the tardy engraver ; there is no in- 
trusion of his personality into the result. These 
considerations are commercially effective, and 
of more weight with both publishers and public 
than realization of the shortcomings of the pro- 
cess print. The blurring of some qualities and 
over-accentuation of others in the mechanical 
reproduction, the inevitable omission of that in- 
tangible vivifying something, which, for want 
of a better name, may be called the soul of the 
work, is commonly overlooked. And with the 
improvement of photography by which more 
accurate rendering of tone values is secured, 
there is much reason to fear that the day of the 
wood engraver is almost at an end. 

•Old Engush Masters. Engraved by Timothy Cole. 
With historical notes by John C. Van Dyke ; and comments 
by the engraver. New York : The Century Co. 



But the end is not quite yet, however, for the 
greatest of all wood engravers has not yet laid 
down his tools. Mr. Timothy Cole's series of 
wood engravings after the old masters of paint- 
ing may without exaggeration be said to repre- 
sent the crowning achievement of the art. This 
is high praise, but not more than is deserved. 
Professor John C. Van Dyke does not put it 
too strongly when he says that the series " can- 
not be regarded as other than monumental." 
The high standard set in the " Old Italian 
Masters " and " Old Dutch and Flemish Mas- 
ters " is fully maintained in Mr. Cole's new 
collection of eight and forty examples of the 
"Old English Masters." In cutting the blocks 
for these, Mr. Cole was constantly occupied for 
nearly seven years. Many of the plates have 
appeared in the " Century Magazine," but in 
their present form they gain much from heavier 
paper and more careful printing. 

In the technique of his craft Mr. Cole is ab- 
solutely unsurpassed. His method is in strict 
accordance with the best traditions of the art. 
Always and everywhere he uses the pure white 
line and stipple around which such animated 
controversies have arisen between advocates of 
different styles of engraving. How wide, how 
almost infinitely varied, are the possibilities of 
this white line, is nowhere better shown than in 
Mr. Cole's masterly use of it. In his hands it 
becomes vibrant, instinct with life ; yet firm, 
clear, and restful. As in all craftsmanship of 
the highest order, there is here no trace of in- 
decision. The handling is free, strong, and di- 
rect, but without any trace of hardness. It is 
this combination of strength with softness and 
delicacy, of breadth, dignity, and subtlety, that 
reveals in Mr. Cole not the mere translator of 
other men's work, but the artist of consummate 
ability. Yet as a translator and interpreter of 
the individual qualities of the painters whose 
works he has reproduced he has also achieved 
a high degree of success. It is difficult to 
say whether, in such an example as the " De- 
tail from Hogarth's Marriage a la Mode," we 
should most admire the exquisite nicety with 
which the quality of the painting, the char- 
acter and expression of the several figures, 
and, in particular, the atmosphere — the en- 
veloppe — of the original have been placed 
before us, or the wonderful technique by which 
this result is accomplished. The achievement 
is the more remarkable when the narrow range 
of the tone values in this picture are taken into 
consideration. A line or a dot misplaced, made 
a hair's breadth too large, or taken in the wrong

direction, would have been fatal to the result. 
The direction in which the lines made by the 
graver shall run is, indeed, one of the most 
important questions which the engraver has to 
decide. It is trne that it is largely determined 
by the perspective of the planes in which the 
surfaces lie. But that is not all that needs to 
be taken into account. Some of the things that 
have to be considered, and how skilfully Mr. 
Cole has met the varied problems presented, 
may be seen by noting the different ways in 
which he has treated the faces in the portraits 
reproduced. How essentially unlike in char- 
acter are the rhythmic and sinuous lines with 
which be has placed before us the lovely face 
of the " Parson's Daughter " by Romney. and 
the white lines crossing each other so as to 
leave little rectangular dots at the intersections, 
which he has employed in the engraving (one 
of the finest in the series) of Sir Henry Rae- 
burn's portrait of Mrs. Scott Moncrieff ! How 
different also is his treatment of the faces in the 
engravings after Reynolds's portrait of Lord 
Heathfield, Hopner's portrait of William Pitt, 
and Raeburn's presentation of the massive fea- 
tures of Lord Newton 1 Equally worthy of 
study are the lines adopted to render the tex- 
tures of the different fabrics depicted, and the 
consummate skill with which both quality of 
surface and tonal truth have been secured. 

A detailed description of all the engravings 
in the volume, or even of the more important 
among them, could hardly be profitable for 
readers not having the book in hand. Mention 
must, however, be made of the superb render- 
ing of Gainsborough's portrait of the Honor- 
able Mrs. Graham. When the richness of its 
textures, the mellowness of its tones, the 
luminous quality of the high lights, more espe- 
cially in the face and hands, the velvety soft- 
ness of the blacks, the subtle gradations, and 
the life and spirit which pervade it, are con- 
sidered, the hopeless inadequacy of even the 
most successful photographic reproduction be- 
comes apparent by comparison. 

The limitations of the wood engraver's art, 
even in the hands of one so accomplished as 
Mr. Cole, are best seen in his landscape and 
marine subjects, though such masterpieces as 
the engravings after Constables " Hampstead 
Heath " and Cotman's " Fishing Boats off 
Yarmouth " may seem to negative this conclu- 
sion. Some of the difficulties to be surmounted 
are indicated in the note which Mr. Cole con- 
tributes to his engravings after Constable. 

"I engraved the picture of the 'Hay Wain' in as 



bold a manner as I could oommaod, because I wanted 
each line to print np as fat and fnll as possible, as I felt 
by this means I might arrive at something analc^os to 
the rich and unetnons coloring characteristic of the 
original. Much that was in the original had, of course, 
to be sacrificed — all its surface, in fact, and a new sur- 
face substituted ( which however, happens in all engrav- 
ing). Whole legions of details are ruthlessly swept 
away, and characteristic lines and stipplea Boiig;lit out 
or invented to supply their places. Thus, for instance, 
the foreground of the 'Hay Wain' is composed of 
pebbles and stones ; but in the small reduction of the 
engraving these eame down so minute it would have 
necessitated such microscopic work that printing would 
have been impossible, and the larger fact of the vigor 
of effect and color could not have been secured. So it 
was throughout the picture. And thus it is with all art : 
sacrifice is the rule. Constable perceived this, and did 
not therefore paint the skin but the spirit of nature." 

It is not alone for Mr. Cole's engravings 
that this volume of " Old English Masters "' is 
noteworthy. The notes on his work that the 
engraver contributes are of great value, and 
Professor Van Dyke's essays on the several 
painters represented are charming in their 
Incidity, and strikingly just in their apprecia- 
tions and criticisms. In fact, whether the book 
be considered as a collection of superb engrav- 
ings valuable either for their intrinsic merit as 
such or as representative of the best paintings 
by the best English artists from about 1750 to 
1850, or as a review of English art during that 
period, it would be difficult to commend it more 
highly than it deserves. All worthy also is 
the enlightened encouragement which has made 
this noble series of engravings possible. If the 
art of wood engraving is to be kept out of the 
category of the things that were, it is to the 
publishers of Mr. Cole's work that most of the 
credit belongs. Frederick W. Gookin. 



A Xkw History of thk Americas 
People.* 



President Woodrow Wilsons " History of 
the American People " is in many ways like 
an expanded and illustrated five-volume edition 
of Professor Goldwin Smith's " The United 
States." Such a statement refers, of course, 
in no particular to subject matter, but rather 
to method of treatment ; the author's plan, ap- 
parently, having been not to enter into details 
regarding; the occurrences in the western world 
between 1492 and 1900, discussing each one in 
chronological sequence, but rather to attempt

to give a correct interpretation of important 
events, to give a judicial estimate of the rela- 
tive value of particular topics, to declare the 
real influence of leaders of life, considering the 
four centuries as a part of the world's history. 

If such a purpose on the part of the author 
be fairly assumed — there is no preface indi- 
cating any plan and the volumes must speak 
for themselves — then it is safe to say that 
this History will be much better appreciated 
by those who have read widely about American 
men and measures, who are more or less familiar 
with details, and therefore are better equipped 
to enjoy a philosophical analysis and review, 
than by those who will turn to it for first in- 
formation about America. In other words one 
can not help feeling that the reader who is un- 
acquainted with the details of wars and presi- 
dential administrations, party problems and 
personal prejudices, will find the History a 
disappointment, after the pleasure of examining 
the pictures is past. 

By the former class, on the other hand, the five 
volumes will be studied with much satisfaction, 
giving as they do approved modern judgment 
of the great questions and great men of Amer- 
ican origin, the scholarly character of the 
author lending weight to his carefully-worded 
sentences. The last portion, covering the years 
from 1866 to 1900, will not be accepted by 
every reader with the same grace accorded the 
earlier narration ; but even sharp differences 
of opinion regarding estimates of measures and 
men of our own time, will not prevent general 
recognition of the success of the author's at- 
tempt to review the work of the four centuries 
in judicial language and lofty tone. 

The most striking first impression from an 
examination of the work is that the illustra- 
tions are remarkable, both for variety and un- 
varying excellence. They embrace represent- 
ative selections from almost every possible 
source. There are pictures of persons, con- 
temporary prints, idealized scenes. There are 
facsimiles of documents and signatures, repro- 
ductions of the title-pages of famous books 
and pamphlets, or of rare campaign posters 
and tickets. There are views of the homes of 
many leaders, and pictures showing the prog- 
ress of invention. There are excellent maps 
and interesting plans, all these making a great 
collection of nearly eight hundred illustrations, 
scattered unevenly throughout the volumes 
and combining to give powerful aid to the nar- 
ration. Some of the pictures are far out of 
relationship to the immediate text, and two of 



them might well have been omitted, since the 
American people do not care to perpetuate the 
memory of features or names of those who as- 
sassinate presidents. It is unfortunate that the 
title " Cumberland Gap near Wheeling Vir- 
ginia " should be used in one case (III, 241), 
an error closely associated with a statement 
(III, 246) that the national road was built 
through the Cumberland Gap to the Ohio, 
when long usage has attached that geographi- 
cal designation to an opening in the mountains 
a good ways south of Wheeling and the course 
of the Cumberland road. 

A second impression, and a strong one too, 
is that there is a lack of proportion in the His- 
tory. There are five volumes, averaging three 
hundred and fifty pages, with 1689, 1781, 
1829, 1866, and 1900 as terminal points. Of 
the eighteen hundred and forty-eight pages 
eight hundred and nineteen are taken up with 
the story of colonial times. One hundred and 
six pages (fifty-six of text and fifty of pictures) 
are used to describe the Revolutionary War; 
while the Civil War is passed in fifty-four 
pages, sixteen of these being given to illustra- 
tions. The Mexican War is finished in three 
pages. In the vista of years the operations 
of the Ku Klux Klan in Reconstruction times 
surely will not seem of commanding impor- 
tance, and yet they are accorded three and a 
half pages, — the amount of text space taken 
to discuss the Jay Treaty of 1794, Burr's Con- 
spiracy, Decatur's achievements in the Medi- 
terranean, and the Missouri Compromise, all 
together. The Louisiana Purchase is described 
in fewer words than is Bryan's free silver 
campaign. The Trent affair, and the military 
movement culminating at Gettysburg in what 
has been called one of the world's decisive 
battles, are each given half a page, while the 
disturbance created by Sitting Bull commands 
as much space as these two together. And yet 
it must be said, that while the average reader 
will notice the scant treatment accorded certain 
events in their chronological sequence, the one 
who forgets details and seeks the philosophical 
analysis of history, the logical relationship of 
cause and effect, will find elsewhere in some 
chapter of summary review the points omitted 
in their natural order. 

The earlier part of the narration seems most 
matured. There is a charm of style which is 
irresistible, the illustrations are very helpful, 
and it is doubtful whether there exists another 
so interesting account of the " swarming of the 
English " and the gradual approach of these

English to the Revolution of 1776. The later 
part discusses topics of our own times upon 
■which the minds of men are yet divided. The 
four million ei^ht hundred thousand voters 
who favored Mr. Blaine in 1884 will hardly be 
satbfied with the treatment accorded him as 
compared with that of the one who. although 
elected, was credited with but sixty-two thou- 
sand more of the popular vote. The almost 
constant condemnation of the Republican party 
of a whole generation, and the evident leaning 
toward the Democratic policies and leaders, 
notably Mr. Cleveland, will not be relished by 
others, even by those who will accept as prob- 
ably correct the judgments on Reconstruction 
measures of the Republican radicals. It is ex- 
tremely difficult to be absolutely unbiased upon 
those themes associated with the actions and 
motives of men now living: and yet whatever 
the reader's personal view may be, the pages 
devoted to later American history will be found 
extremely interesting and suggestive. 

In all likelihood the chapters which deal 
with the Jacksonian period will be considered 
the best of all. The dominating presence of 
masterful men is felt, and one catches the spirit 
of the times from the flowing sentences whose 
graeefnl words paint speaking pwrtraits. Some- 
thins of the charm of the stvle is shown in this 
characterization of Daniel Webster: 

" Mr. Harne's sentences rode high, upon rhetoric tlutt 
sought often an adrentiirous flight ; Mr. Webster used 
words as if he niea.nt only to clarify and strengthen the 
thonghts he touched and cared uothing for cadence 
or ornament. And vet be spread them in ranks so 
fair diat they caught and held the eye like a pageant. 
Beaoty came upon them as they mored as if out of the 
mere passion of the thought rather than by the deagn 
of the orator. And he himself gave to the eye, as he 
stood, in his own person the same image of elean-ent 
strength, beautifal only by reason of its perfect action, 
so square was he, massive, and indomitable, and with a 
bead and faee whose mass, whose ealm breadth above 
the deep-set sinmbrons eyes, seemed the fittest passible 
throne for the powers he displayed." 

But the beauty of the imagery does not give 
strength to the account of the Jacksonian era ; 
it is rather the apparent justness of the judg- 
ments. Taking a dozen topics of the middle 
period and examining the treatment of each, 
the reader feels that the decision of history in 
the light of modern criticism is here rightly 
recorded. The story of the reign of King 
Andrew is splendidly told : the difference be- 
tween the democracy of Jefferson and that of 
Jackson is clearly set forth ; the certain catas- 
trophe is strikingly described : and the survi- 
vals of the wreck are plainly marked for per- 



manent mementoes of a personal regime. If 
only Jackson had been scored unmercifully for 
the results of his career, the account would be 
perfect, but even now one seems to hesitate to 
blame him for actions which in any other man 
would lead to severest criticism. 

Many other portions of the History might 
be mentioned in particular, — Jackson's view 
of the court, his view of the constitution, the 
explanation of his attitude toward South Car- 
olina, the discussion of the effect of slavery 
upon the South, the splendid chapter reviewing 
the Southern Confederacy, — bat enough has 
been said. Here are five volumes by a clear- 
headed student of American affairs which are 
suggestive and interesting, filled with striking 
sentences, and convincing in their thoughtful 
declarations. They make a notable addition to 
that variety of the literature of American his- 
tory already rich in the contributions of writers 
like McMaster and Fiske and Rhodes.

POETKT.* 



Browning has been the chosen theme of lit- 
erary critics for more than a decade, and 
already a bibliography upon the subject coven 
scores of pages. No volume has presented a 
more comprehensive or more exhaustive study 
of the poet and artist than the recent series of 
essays by Mr. Stopford A. Brooke, published 
in tiieir totality as " The Poetry of Robert 
Browning." Uniform in binding and form 
with Mr. Brooke's earlier volume on " Tenny- 
son, his Art and Relation to Modem Life," 
this later analytic study contains many com- 
parative illustrations from the methods and 
works of the two great Victorian poets. In the 
opening chapter of fifty pages, the salient re- 
semblances and diverse traits of Tennyson and 
Browning are carefully summarized. If one 
finds here, in the main, reiteration of former 
scattered comparisons, tribute is merited for 
the potent emphasis of similitude and differ- 
ence. With logical force, Mr. Brooke has 
outlined the growth of criticism, of analytic 
method, of impressionist effects, of historical 
and religious research, — factors largely re- 
sponsible for the wide-spread study of Brown- 
ing's poetry after years of neglect. Within his

strange, intense poems, Mr. Brooke finds mir- 
rored the discords and the eventual harmony 
of latter-day intellectualism. 

" These complex and iiitercleaving conditions of 
thought and passion into which society had grown 
Browning represented from almost the beginning of 
his. work. When society became conscious of them — 
there it found him. And, amazed, it said, ' Here is a 
man who forty years ago lived in the midst of our 
present life and wrote about it.' They saw the wild, 
loud complexity of their world expressed in his verse ; 
and yet more dimly conscious, to their consolation, that 
he was aware of a central peace where the noise was 
quieted and the tangle unravelled." 

Ascribing to Tennyson the greater lauda- 
tion as pure artist, because of his simpler hu- 
man sentiments and his more pellucid form. 
Browning represents to the critic that broad, 
non-partisan vision, both in background and 
motive, v?hich appeals to modern thought. 
With detailed analysis and illustration Mr. 
Brooke considers the chronological develop- 
ment of Browning's essential qualities as poet. 
His " Treatment of Nature " is contrasted with 
the imaginative methods of Tennyson, Words- 
worth, and Byron. Three periods characterize 
his relation to Nature as poetic material, — 
the earlier works wherein Nature and hu- 
manity were interwoven ; the poems following 
"The Ring and the Book," where absorption 
in human problems largely eliminated Nature- 
communion ; and the later partial return to 
primal inspiration from the correlated love for 
Nature and mankind, as in the swan-song, 
"Asolando." 

Browning's "Theory of Human Life" follows 
as sequence from the earlier chapters. From 
" Pauline " and " Paracelsus " to " Abt Vog- 
ler" and "Pisgah-Sights " are embodied the 
same dauntless creed : life is for service ; lim- 
itations and failures are only gradations in 
attainment ; aspiration is divine. 

" And what is that I hunger for but God ? " 
" Sordello " is considered, its obscurity con- 
ceded, its motive and analogies studied. A 
chapter of luminous analysis is devoted to "The 
Ring and the Book," which is allotted " the 
central place in Browning's development as a 
poet." In a general survey of the dramas, both 
as intellectual masterpieces and dramaturgic 
failures, from " Strafford " to " Colombe's 
Birthday," the critic is just in estimate and 
comparison. Tennyson, no less than Browning, 
aspired and failed in this phase of art. 
" Neither Tennyson nor Browning had dra- 
matic genius, — that is, the power to conceive, 
build, coordinate, and finish a drama. But 



they thought they had, and we must pardon 
them for trying their hand." 

The poems of Browning which treat of love 
are divided into personal, — those sacred to 
the memory of his wife, like " One Word 
More " and " Prospiee," — and impersonal, ex- 
ampled in " Love among the Ruins," " Con- 
fessions," and their associates. Despite the 
subtle and complex soul-problems in Brown- 
ing's most typical work, Mr. Brooke has culled 
passages of simple, tender emotions, of joyance, 
sportiveness, pity, of romantic passions as well 
as the more intense impulses of lust, hatred, 
and revenge. Browning's women form a vivid 
gallery of varied personalities. The chapters 
entitled " Womanhood in Browning " abound 
in keen, strong characterizations. In the au- 
thor's judgment, — " Among the women whom 
Browning made, Balaustion is the crown. So 
vivid is her presentation that she seems with us 
in our daily life. And she also fills the histori- 
cal imagination." Thisexaltatiou of Balaustion 
above Pompilia, Colombe, and Guendolen, the 
wonted heroines of Browning's poetry, is ear- 
nestly argued in the critic's idealizing insight 
and his delight in her Grecian womanhood. 
Preserving to the end the chronological method 
of examination, the later chapters survey 
Browning's last poems, his firm grasp on the 
noblest ideals of life, his broad, unbiassed trend. 
If there are occasional lapses in form, and an 
excess of minor illustration, the concluding sum- 
mary of Browning's traits as a poet cannot be 
surpassed in insight and vigor. 

" Creative and therefore joyful, receptive and there- 
fore thoughtful, at one with humanity and therefore 
loving ; aspiring to God and believing in God, and 
therefore steeped to the tips in radiant Hope ; at one 
with the past, passionate with the present, and possess- 
ing by faith an endless and glorious future, — this was 
a life lived on the top of the wave, and moving with its 
motion from youth to manhood, from manhood to old 
age."

roughly, because the volume begins with Locke, New-

of as writers of the seventeenth century, and includes at 
the other end a number of people who lived and worked

That the life of Madame de Pompadoar was 
worth writing may be a qaestion, bat that Mr. H. 
Noel Williams has written it exceedingly well is in- 
dispotably a fact. Likewise he has almost silenced 
criticism upon his choice of a sabjeet by showing 
that, if Madame de Pompadour was the mistress of 
Louis XV., she was also mistress of France, quite 
as clever as she was beaatifoL, ambitious for many 
things besides the smiles of her royal lover, and at 
her worst excusable as the pitiful result of a de- 
bauched and degrading enTironment. The book 
opens with an account of the scandalous plot of 
Louis' courtiers to enliven the dully virtuous life of 
the puppet king by implanting in him a taste for 
wine, cards, and nUsaUiances. Then follow, by way 
of introduction to the account of Madame de Pom- 
padour's own brilliant career, short sketches of the 
troubled reigns of the frivolous court beauties who 
preceded her. But it was no grande dame who was 
to hold the destinies of France and Europe in the 
hollow of her band ; instead a petite bourgeoite 
with a loud-voiced, drnnken father, and a shameless 
mother who, when Autoinette was nine years old, 
informed her that she was too pretty to be wasted 
(m anyone but a king. Madame de Pompadour once 
described her life as "like that of a Christian, a 
perpetual combat." The obstacles to her becoming 
the king's favorite seemed well nigh insurmount- 
able, but her wit and beauty triumphed over them. 
Then, from the day of her installation at Versailles 
until her deaih.it was war unending with "ambitious 
ministers, envious women, and scheming Jesuits"; 
and all the while, if she would hold her place in the 
fickle heart of the king, she must "remain fresh, 
beautiful, and lightrhearted, as if she had not a care 
in the world beyond the shape of a coiffure or the fit 
of a gown." Madame de Pompadour, however, as- 
pired to much more than a suite at Versailles. She 
wished to be, and she was, a great political power. 
"She made and unmade ministers, she selected am- 
bassadors, she appointed generals, she conferred pen- 
sions and places." " It is to Madame de Pompadour 
that we owe everything,'' said Kaunitz. the Austrian 
envoy, referring to the alliance with Maria Theresa; 
and as the Austrian alliance meant France's entry 
into the Seven Years' War, the responsibility for 
all its rninous disasters is, at least indirectly, to be 
charged to her account. But outside of politics her 
influence upon public affairs was undoubtedly benef- 
icent. France rests her debtor for the porcelain 
manufactory at Sevres and in large measure for 
the Ecole Militaire, while French artists and men 
of letters found in her a generous and discrim- 
inating patron. It is this generally ignored phase 
of Madame de Pompadour's character and career 
that Mr. Williams wishes to bring into due prom- 
inence in his account of her life. He has sought 
neither to excuse nor to condemn, but merely to 
present her life in unbiassed portrayal, making up 



his record from contemporary sources as many and 
as diverse as possible. Madame de Pompadour is 
always the central figure of the chronicle, but Louis 
and his ministers, the queen, Maria Theresa, Fred- 
erick of Prussia, and a host of others, stand out 
vividly from the background. Mechanically, the 
volume is one of the most beautiful of the season, 
being printed on the best of paper, with wide mar- 
gins, and illastrated with sixteen superb photo- 
gravures from portraits of the royal family, the 
Pompadour herself, her allies, and her rivals. (Im- 
ported by Scribner.) 

" Every part of Scotland is Seott-land " says Mr. 
W. S. Crockett in his preface to " The Scott Coun- 
try " (Macmillan) ; but he adds that the Border — 
the vale of the Tweed — is par excellenee the home- 
land of " the Mighty Minstrel." To show that the 
Border made Seott what he was, as truly as Scott 
made the romance of the Border a power in litera- 
ture, — to weave the legend of the one into the life 
of him who interpreted that legend in his own 
matchless fashion and who loved the Border scenery 
only less than he did its historic and poetic asso- 
ciations, — is the delightful task Mr. Crockett un- 
dertakes. Himself Border-born and bred, and a 
loving and thorough student of Scottish legend and 
literature. Mr. Crockett combines scholarly accuracy 
and attention to detail with vivid appreciation of 
Seott and the country that Scott loved. The lame 
child's visit to his grandfather's farm, the boy's 
school-life at Kelso, the sheriff's first Border home 
at Ashesiiel, the Making of Abbotsford, Memories 
of Melrose and the Marmion country, — all these 
topics, and much besides, are dealt with compre- 
hensively but not diffusely, and in such a way as to 
make the most of the geographical and biographical 
interests involved. " The Scott Country " contains 
one hundred and sixty-two illustrations, made from 
sketches and photographs, and picturing all sorts of 
places that the antravelled reader longs to see and 
the traveller loves to recall. It is a pity that the 
very attractive cover design, a pattern in Scotch 
thistles, should be spoiled by the strikingly inhar- 
monious red background. 

To true lovers of Scott and of literary biography, 
" The Scott Country " will serve merely as a de- 
lightful introduction to a holiday edition, in five 
volumes, of the classic Life of Scott by Lock- 
hart. It is strange that this monumental biography, 
second only to Boewell's Johnson, while it has often 
been reprinted since its original publication in 1837, 
has never before been adequately edited. It has 
been the aim of the present publishers (Houghton, 
Mifi9in & Co.) to fill in the " necessary silences" of 
the biographer, himself so nearly a eontemfK>rary 
of Sir Walter, from the material furnished by the 
memoirs, reminiscences, magazine articles, reviews, 
and prefatory sketches, which, particularly within 
the last twenty years, have added so much to our 
knowledge of Scott and of his friends and acquaint- 
ance. The editorial work of this edition has been 
done by Miss Susan M. Francis, whose intimate

knowledge of the Scott literature and painstaking 
use of its resources amply justify the confidence 
placed in her. The integrity of the original work is 
preserved by bracketing all the editorial notes and 
dating such of Lockhart's as were written for the 
1839 and 1845 issues and for the condensation 
prepared by him in 1848. Constant use has been 
made of Mr. David Douglas's editions of Scott's 
journal and letters. Much of the annotation bears 
upon associates of Scott, well known to Lockhart's 
contemporaries, but now faded from public con- 
sciousness ; and a sketch of Lockhart's life stands 
before his preface. Qaite as noteworthy as the 
scholarly annotation are the excellence of the typog- 
raphy, the fitness of the plain green binding, and 
the beauty of the photogravures. One feels, also, 
that justice has at last been done to the serious 
intention and happy achievement of Lockhart. In 
these days of made-to-order biography, it is well to 
be reminded occasionally that the true biographer 
is born, not made, and that erudite industry over 
the records is a poor substitute for real acquaint- 
ance with the man portrayed. This very complete, 
scholarly, and beautifully embellished revision of a 
great model cannot but be warmly welcomed, espe- 
cially by those seeking a gift-book of the more ster- 
ling and substantial sort that always finds accept- 
ance with readers of taste and culture. 

Among the wealth of new nature-studies, it is 
well that the forerunner of them all in this country, 
Thoreau's " Walden," is not forgotten. Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., who in 1897 issued a 
two-volume holiday edition of the work, this year 
offer practically the same book, with only such 
changes as were necessary to bring it into a single 
volume. Lovers of Thoreau will find it hard to re- 
sist the charm of this sumptuous edition. The 
book-making is perfect in every detail. The thirty 
photogravures, made from photographs and printed 
on Japanese vellum, are revelations of what soft- 
ness and beauty can be secured by that process. 
Without following the lines of the text, they illus- 
trate all phases of Thoreau's life, — bis homes and 
haunts, his friends and himself. The best, perhaps, 
are a portrait of Alcott, one of Thoreau in 1855, 
a view of the old Marlborough road, and the Wal- 
den pictures. No brief notice can do the book 
justice ; it is that rare thing, a wholly satisfactory 
edition of a favorite classic. 

Those of Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie's readers who 
remember with pleasure the illustrated edition of 
" A Child of Nature," will now welcome " Under 
the Trees" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), with decorations 
by the same artist, Mr. Charles L. Hinton. Be- 
sides several full-page photogravures, there is a 
series of twelve border designs, colored in delicate 
green and repeated through the pages of the book. 
Mr. Hinton's conception of nature is Greek. 
Nymphs and satyrs wander through the meadows 
or rest by the brook-sides, shepherds pipe dreamily 
under the trees, and frisky little Bacchantes gather 
grapes for their banqueting. In this way has the 



artist chosen to emphasize Mr. Mabie's sense of the 
personality of nature, his quest for the mystic soul 
behind the gorgeous trappings, which is perhaps 
the key-note of his nature-study. 

A nature book of an absolutely different type is 
Mr. William J. Long's " School of the Woods " 
(Ginn & Co.). Mr. Long's interest is not, like Mr. 
Mabie's, in the moving principle behind the out- 
door world, nor in viewing nature as a reflection 
of himself ; but in the wood and field-folk them- 
selves, and in their lives as individuals. Mr. Long 
is probably our foremost animal psychologist ; and 
his method and material are all his own. The make- 
up of his book suggests Mr. Seton-Thompson's work, 
and the quaint Indian names used for the animals 
a method of Rudyard Kipling. But these resem- 
blances are superficial ; Mr. Long enters the field 
with ideas and methods of his own. One novel 
suggestion running through most of the stories, and 
determining the title of the book, is that in animal 
as in human life education is the great controlling 
force. Instinct, Mr. Long says, is like heredity : 
without training it amounts to nothing ; and he 
supports his theory by showing how, to a careful 
observer, " the summer wilderness is just one vast 
school-house," full of wild mothers teaching the 
secret of success in life to their little ones. Mr. 
Long is a keen observer, a clear expositor, and a 
delightful story-teller, certain to please both the 
children and their elders. The illustrations are by 
Mr. Charles Copeland, who has made, besides the 
full-page drawings, some two hundred marginal 
sketches, fascinating in themselves and aptly illus- 
trative of the text. The book makes a real addi- 
tion to animal lore and literature. 

A new volume in the "British Artists Series" 
(Macmillan) is Lord Ronald Sutherland Gower's 
account of " Sir Joshua Reynolds, his Life and 
Art." Lord Gower's style is sometimes clumsy, 
but his intimate knowledge of his subject and his 
skilful choice of detail incline the reader to pardon 
an occasional lapse into obscurity. He appreciates 
Sir Joshua's towering humanity, as well as his 
matchless art ; so that painter and layman alike 
can read his book with pleasure. To the biograph- 
ical account are appended supplementary chapters 
upon Sir Joshua's writings, the engravers of his 
works, and important sales and exhibitions of his 
paintings. As is true of all the volumes of this 
series, a chief feature of this volume is its profuse 
and beautiful illustrations. These consist of repro- 
ductions of ninety of Sir Joshua's pictures, many of 
them having been photographed for the first time 
especially for Lord Gower's book. There are two 
especially beautiful plates in photogravure. It is 
a pity that the proof-reader should have failed to 
note so obvious an error as that on page 10. 

From the same publishers (Macmillan) comes a 
second edition of Mr. Langton Douglas's " Fra 
Angelico," first issued in 1900. No apology is 
needed for the re-publication of what is at once so 
scholarly ^nd authoritative a criticism and so pre- 



1902.]

eminent an example of good book-making. That 
Fra Angelieo's familiar angeU, — ''celestial dolU, 
flat as paper, stuck fast to their gold frames," — 
are not onlr nnworthy of the homage paid them, 
but are not even representatiTe of Fra Angelico, 
who " was primarily an artist, an artist who hap- 
pened to be a saint,*' is, in brief, Mr. Doaglaa's 
thesis. That his information is sound, his reasoning 
cogent, and his presentation striking and attractive, 
is proved by the demand for another edition of the 
monograph. With its many excellent reproductions 
of the painter's works, a complete index to his 
paintings and drawings, and a bibliography, it 
makes not only an attractive holiday book, but a 
really valuable addition to art criticism. 

Another painter to be honored this season with 
a sumptuously illustrated volume is Jean Francis 
Millet. His life was partly written by his dear 
friend Alfred Sensier, after whose death it was 
completed and published in 1881. This book is now 
out of print. The only English translation was 
much abridged ; and since it was made, more of 
Millet's letters and many interesting ptersonal 
reminiscences of him have been published. In Mrs. 
Julia Cartwrigbt's new ■* Life and Letters of Mil- 
let" (Maemillan) ^n effort has been made to ntilite 
all previous resources, and thus to give to English 
readers a complete and interesting biography of the 
great peasant painter. Much of the story is told in 
Millet's own words, — in letters, or in recollections 
written for Sensier's use. The strong graphic style 
of his paintings also distinguishes Millet's writings; 
so that one feels the largely epistolary biography 
to be the right form here. The treatment is en- 
tirely narrative, with the smallest possible amount 
of art criticism. It is the spirit of the paintings, 
not their technique, that appeals to the author, — 
the humanity of the artist rather than his genius 
with the brush. His gallant up-hill fight against 
the rigid classicism that debased and narrowed the 
art of his time, his determination to starve rather 
than be known as a " painter of naked women," his 
masterly idealization of the prosaic theme of dull, 
grinding toil. — these are the things that seem to 
his biographer best worth considering ; and so, no 
doubt, would Millet have looked at the matter. 
Bat while there is very little analysis of his art. 
the story of its evolution, from the graceful little 
pastels of nymphs and cherubs that would sell, to 
the unconventional peasants that would not, is told 
vividly and sympathetically. As biography, the 
book is successful in that it evolves a personality ; as 
art history, its value is greatly enhanced by the 
frontispiece portrait and the nine reproductions in 
photogravure of Millet's works. 

There is open to every biographer a choice be- 
tween the subjective and the objective emphasis. 
The former may be nearer to " the thing-in-itself," 
and will inevitably be more intimate, more minute, 
and probably more exhaustive. But the objective 
presentation has also its value, showing briefly, ac- 
curately, and sympathetically, as it does in its beet 



examples, the man among his fellows, as he ap- 
pears to his friends and acquaintance, who have 
scant attention to bestow on him save only what 
the power of his personality and the measure of his 
achievements wrest from them. So. thoaeh Mr. 
Mackail's admirable biography of William Morris is 
perhaps the final word upon the personal life of its 
subject, there is a place also for Miss Elisabeth L. 
Gary's ■■ William Morris, Poet, Craftsman, Social- 
ist" (Putnam). This is the objective account of 
the artist, tracing in general outline, no less vivid 
beeaaea leea detailed, his busy, many-sided career. 
The book ia boand uniformly with the same author's 
previous volumes on Tennyson, Browning, and the 
Bossettis, and is profusely illustrated with photo- 
gravure portraits, and reproductions of wall paper 
and tapestry designs, of furniture and other pro- 
ducts turned oat by the firm of Morris & Co., and of 
Kelmseott types, press-marks, and specimen pages. 
Morris's various activities are treated in separate 
chapters, but the unity in the remarkable diversity 
of his interests is shown, and the steps in his de- 
velopment from craftsman to socialist made clear. 
Miss Cary's special fitness for the work she is do- 
ing lies in her ability to select from among masses 
of detail what will best evoke a personality for the 
general reader. She never loses her sense of pro- 
portion nor fails in easy manipulation of her mater- 
ials. If she is least interesting when she writes of 
Morris the poet, perhaps that is only beeaose poetry 
was Morris's least interesting mode of expression. 

The thirty-two reproductions of American mas- 
terpieces contained in the new illustrated edition 
of Mr. Charles H. Caffin's *' American Masters of 
Painting" (Donbleday) serve a two-fold purpose, 
showing pictorially what our art has achieved in its 
brief course and explicating Mr. Caffin's references 
for those of his readers who have no other means 
of checking his estimates. Apart from the vital 
interest of their subject matter, Mr. Caffin's eaaaya 
are charming bits of criticism. His style is clear, 
concise, and direct, yet intensely suggestive, and 
packed with allusions that indicate real mastership 
of the subject. His ** appreciations " are not im- 
pressionisdc, bat are firmly based upon keen analysis 
of the distinctive qualities of each painter ; and these 
qaalities in turn are accoanted for as the joint pro- 
duet of the man and the artistic affinities he has foand 
for himself in this country or, more often, abroad. 
These essays, thirteen in number, are the first ade- 
quate attempt to set forth the present standing of 
American art, as it has been lifted by such men as 
Inness. Whistler, Sargent. Abbey, Tryon. Winslow 
Homer, and La Farge. The last essay in the vol- 
ume is in the nature of a retrospect, having for its 
subject Gilbert Stuart, the first of ■■ American Mas- 
ters of Painting." 

In two volumes, prettily bound in blue and gold 
and boxed together, comes Miss Clara E. Laughlin's 
"Stories of Authors' Loves" (Lippincof). Inter- 
est in the love-affairs of literary men and women 
is undeniable, at least among feminine readers, and.

so Miss Laaghlin thinks, quite legitimate. For 
have not they created onr traditions and ideals of 
romance, and is not the desire natural which seeks 
to know how they realized these ideals ? Is not a 
"hoarded happiness a talent in a napkin," and a 
failure a danger signal ? So Miss Laughlin justifies 
herself, though it is doubtful if she needs any justi- 
fication, since she is not exploiting new material but 
merely giving to the old a new emphasis. She tells 
her little romances pleasantly and sympathetically, 
extenuating rather than sitting in judgment, aiming 
for truth both to fact and spirit, making only rare 
lapses into anything approaching sentimentality. 
The materials treated are drawn from sources as 
diverse as the lives of Dante, Dickens, and Thoreau, 
of Keats, Hawthorne, and George Eliot. Each ro- 
mance is so related as to call up much else in the 
author's career, and thus proportion is preserved. 
The portraits and views used as illustrations are 
well selected, and beautifully reproduced in photo- 
gravure and duogravure. 

Ten years ago, when Miss Alice M. Bacon brought 
out her book on "Japanese Girls and Women," she 
touched upon a phase of life in the land of the 
chrysanthemum that had been wholly ne&;lected by 
previous writers. So thoroughly did she do her 
work that it has since stood almost without a rival ; 
and the new illustrated edition of the book (Hough- 
ton), revised to fit the changed conditions of to-day, 
needs no justification. The principal change in the 
text is the addition of two chapters, one upon house- 
hold customs, the other a survey and analysis of the 
astonishing progress made by the Japanese women 
within the last ten years. But in every chapter 
there are revisions and additions, chronicling such 
matters as the coming of the baby carriage, the de- 
cline of the etiquette lesson in the interest of higher 
education — including gymnastics, — and the liter- 
ary club, the opening to women of all sorts of new 
occupations, and their elevation by means of legisla- 
tion and in public opinion ; hinting, in short, at the 
rapid modernizing and Westernizing of feminine 
Japan. The illustrations made for this edition by 
Keishu Takenouchi, one of the foremost illustrators 
of Japan, and including outline drawings and colored 
plates, are altogether charming. Being also, as Miss 
Bacon assures us, absolutely true to the facts, they 
serve to add vividness and reality to the text. The 
dainty Japanese cover design lends a finishing touch 
to a very attractive book. 

" The American Diary of a Japanese Girl " 
(Frederick A. Stokes Co.) is an amusing account, 
in journal form, of its author's six months' visit to 
" Amerikey," under the chaperonage of an indulgent 
uncle. The work is sufficiently extravagant, and at 
the same time sufficiently clever, to be either an 
excellent American forgery or a genuine experience. 
In either case it is interesting. The author, who 
styles herself " Miss Morning Glory," spent inost 
of her time in California, paying but a flying visit 
to Chicago, which she stigmatizes as the smoky 
"City of Man," and barely reached New York 



when she decided to court further novelty by mask- 
ing for a month as a house-servant. At this point 
her journal abruptly closes with the promise of a 
later installment entitled " The Diary of a Parlour 
Maid." An odd mixture of na'ivetS and affectation, 
of vanity and sentimentality, of sprightly satire and 
quiet humor, makes up the book. It is daintily 
illustrated by a Japanese artist — or at least an 
artist with a Japanese name, — who has drawn 
" Miss Morning Glory " in all sorts of novel and 
interesting situations. The cover, with its Japanese 
design and its edging of yellow straw, is striking 
and appropriate. 

One of the most delightful holiday books of a 
season or two ago was the edition of Mr. Kenneth 
Grahame's "The Golden Age," with illustrations 
by Mr. Maxfield Parrish. A happier combination 
of author and illustrator could hardly have been hit 
upon, and Mr. Grahame's classic sketches of child- 
life took a new interest through Mr. Parrish's im- 
aginative interpretations. Even more delightful is 
the companion volume now issued containing the 
same author's " Dream Days" (John Lane). Here 
Mr. Parrish's drawings are reproduced in photo- 
gravure, instead of the half-tone process used in the 
earlier book, and as a result we are able to view the 
artist's work very nearly as it appears in the orig- 
inal, with all its minute refinement of detail and 
delicate contrasts of light and shade. In addition 
to the ten photogravures in the text, Mr. Parrish 
has also drawn, in his own inimitable way, the title- 
page, cover-design, tail-pieces, and end-papers for 
the book. It is hardly necessary to speak here of 
Mr. Grahame's text. His two books hold a place 
apart in the literature of childhood, and we can 
well envy the reader who has yet to make their 
acquaintance. 

Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village" has been 
brought out by Messrs. Harper & Brothers in a 
sumptuous holiday edition, with an introduction by 
Mr. Austin Dobson, followed by Goldsmith's own 
quaint dedication to Sir Joshua Reynolds, and more 
than thirty full-page illustrations by Mr. Edwin A. 
Abbey. Mr. Dobson's introduction is a delicate and 
sympathetic analysis of the real and ideal elements 
in the poem, and is written in his happiest critical 
vein. Mr. Abbey's drawings, which are of course 
the feature of the edition, are imaginative, pictur- 
esque, and charming in themselves, like all his illus- 
trative work, and really interpretative of the text. 
They are filled with the same quiet beauty and 
pathos, are lighted by the same stray gleams of 
humor, and marked by the same spirit of bygone 
days and rural scenes, that give " The Deserted 
Village " its peculiar fldvor. 

The stories of about fifty " Historic Houses of 
New Jersey " are interestingly related by Mr. W. 
Jay Mills in a handsome volume published by the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. This is a book that enthusi- 
astic Colonial Dames and Sons and Daughters of 
the Revolution will gloat over, particularly if they 
be also sons and daughters of New Jersey. Not

that the int«reet of the sketches is limited and lo- 
cal, for the landmarks of New Jersej are the land- 
marks of the nation. History, family tradition, 
anecdote, gossip, letters, and local records, hare all 
been ransacked to call np the brilliant past of the 
little state and make it live before the reader. 
Every effort has been pat forth to secare accuracy 
and completeness, as well as vividness, in this new 
field of research ; and the resalt is a series of brief, 
clear, and very significant aecoants of the historic 
associations and famous inhabitants of a few of New 
Jersey's old homes. About twenty photogravures 
from drawings, photographs, and rare old prints, 
add materially to the interest of the book. 

Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton's brief biographical 
sketches of " Famous Artists " (Crowell). first pub- 
lished in 1890. is now re-issued in holiday form, 
with a portrait of each painter and four or five ex- 
amples of bis work. The author's point of view is 
neither scientific nor critical. She aims merely to 
relate in compact form the main events of each 
artist's life in such a way as to emphasize bis lof^ 
purpose and noble achievements. Industry, reso- 
lution, ambition, enthusiasm, fidelity in all the 
relations of life, are brought forward in each biog- 
raphy as the means by which poverty, jealous com- 
peers, and unreasonable patrons were vanquished 
and success attained. The artists discussed are 
Michael' Angelo. Da Vioci, Raphael. Titian. Ma- 
rillo, Rubens, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Landseer, and 
Turner. 

Similar in scope to the foregoing book, and pub- 
lished by the same firm, is the two-volume work on 
"Famous Composers," by Mr. Nathan H. Dole. 
Like Mrs. Bolton's book, also, this work was first 
issued about ten years ago. The present edition is 
beautifully bound and contains a portrait of each 
composer considered in the text, together with nu- 
merous other full-page illustrations. The biograph- 
ical sketches, twenty in number, are complete, accu- 
rate, and entertaining. Though they will of course 
be found of greatest interest by music-lovers, they 
are also adapted to the comprehension of the mere 
layman who wishes to know at least the main facts in 
the lives of the world's great musicians. The list 
of composers considered extends from Palestrina 
to Wagner. 

Max Mailer's charming and popular old-world 
idyl called •• Memories " is given an artistic setting 
in the holiday edition issued this year by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. Besides a decorated initial 
at the beginning of each chapter, there are eight 
full-page lUu'trations from charcoal drawings by 
Miss Blanche O'^tertag. These combine with the 
wide margins, beautiful typography, and unique 
cover design, to make a book both quaint and dainty, 
as befits the classic little romance. The translation, 
which first appeared in 1888. is the work of Mr. 
George P. Upton. He has caught quite as well 
as Miss 0»tertag the quiet, contemplative spirit of 
this "prose poem" and the graceful simplicity of 
its language, which his English faithfully repro- 



duces. Interesting as showing an unexpected phase 
of Max Mailer's many-sided activity, illustrating, 
too. in its style, the canon of unaeademic simplicity 
which he never tired of preaching to his pedantic 
countrymen, but charming above all for its delicacy 
of sentiment, "Memories" in its present artistic 
form will appeal to many holiday buyers. 

Miss Esther Singleton, whose compilations are 
valued by a. large circle of readers, has this year 
edited and arranged two more volumes, " London " 
and "Famous Paintings" (Dodd, Mead <& Co.). 
The latter continues the work begun in " Great 
Paintings Described by Great Writers." As before. 
Miss Singleton has been careful to select only rec- 
ognized masterpieces, and to choose as commenta- 
tors competent and interesting critics who know 
how to interpret a picture broadly, so as to make 
it speak for the artist's whole work. As a guide- 
book or a foundation for art-study at home, thu 
work will be found interesting and valuable. The 
volume on London is much on the plan of the pre- 
Tions one on Paris, except that the selections, in- 
stead of dealing with special monuments, oftener 
record general impressions mide by various parts 
of the great city. The subject is limited by the 
exclusion of articles on London of the past. The 
pieturesqueness of the city, its immensity, the dis- 
tinctive characteristics of the several districts, the 
churches, clubs, and theatres, varioas types of Lon- 
doners, and the charm of the London fog. are a few 
of the chief topics treated in charming essays by 
such writers as Dickens, G. W. Steevens, Gautier, 
Sir Walter Besant, and others. Bath of Miss 
Singleton's books are profusely and beautifully 
illustrated. 

In the two handsome volumes entiUed " French 
Cathedrals and Chateaux " (Euight & Millet), 
Miss Clara Crawford Perkins combines a simple 
account of the development of architectural styles 
in France with a guide to the great monuments of 
French architecture. About a third of the first 
volume is occupied with a general treatment of the 
growth of the Gothic style, — including chapters 
on glass-staining, the art of tracery, and the 
sculpture employed as accessory decoration, — 
and with historical outlines and tables. These last 
are intended for use in connection with the numer- 
ous references to names and events in the chapters 
that follow. Descriptions of some of the g^at 
French cathedrals, with attention to their historical 
associations as well as to the artistic q^ialities of 
each, make up the remainder of Volume I. Volume 
II. begins with an explanatory chapter on Renais- 
sance architecture, and, since that type found its 
best expression in secular and domestic buildmgs. 
goes on to describe some of the more notable pal- 
aces and chateaux. Sixty-two half-tone engravings 
add clearness and attractiveness to the descriptive 
portions of the text. The plan of the work will 
commend itself to amateur students of architecture, 
who know how few manuals of architecture there 
are, at once simple, comprehensive, and trust-

worthy ; while travellers, dissatisfied with mere 
unrelated legends and isolated descriptions, will be 
glad to find so good a book for study and so pleas- 
ant a companion for their sight-seeing and their 
personal observations of the many interesting things 
described in Miss Perkins's expository chapters. 

Mr. John Kelman's "The Holy Land" (Mac- 
millan) is a new evidence of the ever-increasing 
interest in Palestine and its history. To be able 
to vivify the meagre Gospel narrative of Christ's 
life, to paint in the "local color" and so impart 
the note of reality, the tang of a genuine experi- 
ence to the apostolic story, is a vital need of mod- 
ern Christianity, and one which few of us can 
journey to Palestine to satisfy. Among the vol- 
uminous literature intended to serve as a substitute 
for such a pilgrimage the distinction of the present 
volume lies in the extraordinary beauty of its col- 
ored plates, and in the excellent arrangement, in- 
teresting detail, and completeness of the text. Mr. 
Kelman arranges his impressions of Palestine un- 
der three divisions. Part I., " The Land," is of 
course largely descriptive. Its opening chapter, 
upon the color of the country, is particularly happy 
as serving to introduce Mr. Fulleylove's paintings, 
the most conspicuous feature of which is perhaps 
their exquisite coloring. Part II., "The Invaders," 
deals with the traces, material and spiritual, left 
upon Palestine by Israelitish, Roman, Christian, 
and Moslem occupations. Part III., entitled "The 
Spirit of Syria," sets forth Mr. Kelman's impres- 
sions of the spectre-haunted hopelessness, the par- 
alyzing superstition, and the stolid indifference to 
disease and filth that characterize modern Palestine. 
The book closes with the suggestion that not in the 
Zionist movement but in the advance of Western 
ideals and in the Christian missions is there hope of 
a resurrection for the Holy Land. Mr. Kelman is 
a careful observer and a lucid and often brilliant 
writer ; so that his work is quite worthy of being 
made the basis for Mr. Fulleylove's splendid paint- 
ings. Altogether " The Holy Land " is one of the 
most attractive of the season's publications. 

Pleasant records of strolls " Along French By- 
ways," " Among English Hedgerows," and through 
" The Isle of the Shamrock," have earned for Mr. 
Clifton Johnson a reputation as a delightful racon- 
teur and an expert photographer. His latest book, 
"New England and Its Neighbors" (Macmillan), 
is similar in form, and in its emphasis upon the 
rural aspects of the community's life, to the volumes 
that precede it. Many of the sketches have been 
published before as magazine articles. Some have 
an historic or literary interest — as, for example, 
the chapters entitled " Midwinter in Valley Forge " 
and " The Home of Fenimore Cooper," But this 
is incidental; the book is primarily a study of farm- 
life among the Yankees and their New York 
neighbors, as such chapter-titles as " Down in 
Maine," " The Autumn Cattle Show," and " Life 
on a Green Mountain Top" will suggest. From 
Mr. Johnson's preface we learn that this volume is 



to be the first in an American series of works dealing 
with some of the distinctive and picturesque phases 
of our native country life. The book is abundantly 
illustrated from the author's own photographs. 

The descriptive element, incidental but of un- 
common interest, in Miss Ellen Glasgow's " Voice 
of the People," is emphasized in the new illustrated 
edition issued by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
A series of twenty-four pictures, from photographs 
taken especially for this book, portray the sleepy 
old town of Kingsborough, where the action of the 
story begins and ends, and Richmond, where Nicho- 
las Burr, its hero, spent his tragically ended term 
as governor. " The Voice of the People " is one of 
the few recent novels likely to have a lasting inter- 
est ; and this edition, with its added suggestions of 
local color and out-door charm, and its unusually 
artistic cover, bright with the fiame of the Virginia 
creeper, is a well-merited tribute to the strong and 
serious work of the author. 

Out of Book I. of " Ben Hur," which, it will be 
remembered, tells the story of the Christ-child's 
birth, Messrs. Harper & Brothers have made a 
beautiful little holiday volume. The illustrations 
are brown toned plates from paintings by Murillo, 
Raphael, Knaus, and Barabino ; and there are, be- 
sides, tinted marginal drawings illustrating the 
text. General Wallace's special preface is very 
interesting, telling the story of the inception of 
" Ben Hur," which, it seems, grew out of a chance 
conversation with the late Robert G. Ingersoll. 
Long before, however, the author's interest in the 
Wise Men of the East had led to the writing of a 
brochure upon their journey to Bethlehem ; and this 
old manuscript, hitherto unpublished, was brought 
forth to make the beginning of the longer story. 
Bat the independent unity of the birth narrative 
was not sacrificed, and it made possible the inde- 
pendent publication, in 1899, of the original bro- 
chure. The present richly illustrated edition, how- 
ever, is the one that General Wallace looked forward 
to 'when he first recognized the literary possibilities 
of this most mystically beautiful of all the legends 
that cluster about the first Christmas day. 

From Messrs. Thomas Nelson & Sons come three 
volumes recently added to the " New Century Li- 
brary." They comprise "The Complete Poetical 
Works of Robert Burns," " The Poetical Works of 
Alfred Tennyson" (containing the poems written 
between 1830 and 1859), and "The Life and Ad- 
ventures of Don Quixote." The little volumes, four 
by six inches in size and none of them an inch thick, 
are printed in large type on the thinnest of India 
paper, and daintily yet durably bound in cloth or 
limp leather. Each volume contains a frontispiece 
portrait, and the edition of Burns includes an "ap- 
preciation " of the poet by Lord Rosebery. For a 
holiday gift-book of moderate price, combining solid 
worth of contents with beauty of outward form, 
nothing better could be found than any one of these 
dainty pocket volumes.

Letters of 1846, tending m thej did to renew biog- 
raphie interest in the poet-lovers, the lyries of both 
writers seem fraught with a deeper and more ha- 
man cbartn. In particalar do Mrs. Browning's 
"Sonnets from the Portngnese " — the poetically 
restrained portrajal of the ptassion that floods an- 
measared through the letters — compel fresh notice 
of their exalted tenderness of feeling and their per- 
fection of form. Bat while the sonnets themselves 
offer ample justification for a new edition, the 
distinctive feature of the dainty book just issued 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons is the series of 
exquisitely-colored illustrationg, including borders 
and fall-page drawings, by Miss Margaret Arm- 
strong. The color-printing is particularly good, and 
the whole book is in keeping with the delicate spirit 
of the jx>etry. 

Miss Marie Corelli sends to her American friends 
and readers through Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
"A Christmas Greeting," in the form of the old- 
time "annual" or gift-book, whose mission, like 
that of the Christmas card, was to convey the 
compliments of the season, and whose appropriate 
resting-place was rather the parlor table than the 
library shelf. Perhaps Miss Corelli deplores the 
new connotation that the term " Holiday book " ia 
rapidly acquiring, and thinks we have not yet fully 
emphasized the meaning of Christmas and of the 
New Year. Or, possibly, in prej>aring her "Christ- 
mas Greeting " she meant merely to utilize the odds 
and ends of material on her writing table, and in- 
cidentally to show how versatile she could be when 
she chose. In this last attempt she has certainly 
succeeded. £»say8. sketches, stories (including 
some for children), poems, and even a piece of 
mosic, are included in the contents of the volume, 
— a remarkable variety, certainly, to come with 
apparent ease from one pen. All the sabject- 
matter has a Christmas flavor, but many of the 
distinctive ideas for which Miss Corelli stands are 
touched upon in the sketches. Much of the verse 
is patriotic, and several articles deal with current 
affairs in England. 

Three volumes have been added this year to the 
dainty little " Thumb-Nail Series" (Century Co.) : 
"The Rivals." with an introduction from Mr. Jef- 
ferson's Autobiography; "In Memoriam." with Mr. 
Stedman's criticism from the " Victorian Poets " as a 
preface ; and the " Thoughts " of Pascal, translated 
and edited by Mr. Benjamin E. Smith. The em- 
bowed leather covers are wrought in beaatifal 
symbolic designs, and the little classics as a whole 
are notable examples of suitable and delightful 
book-making. 

The last completed story of the late Paul Leices- 
ter Ford, " Wanted — A Chaperon, " has been 
brought oat in dainty holiday dress by Messrs. 
Dodd. Mead & Co. It is a clever little narrative, 
in much the same style as "Wanted — A Match- 
maker," and, like the other story, it has been illus- 
trated in color by Mr. Christy and embellished with 



flower-borders by Miss Margaret Armstrong, who 
also drew the nniqoe cover design. It is one of the 
prettiest of the smaller holiday books of the season. 

To the "Ariel Booklete," Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons' series of diminutive classics, Dickens's "Christ' 
mas Carol " is the most recent addition. There are 
now fifty-seven volumes to be had in this pretty 
series, with their neat printing and limp red leather 
covers. " A Christmas Carol " is profusely illus- 
trated by Mr. Frederick Simpson Coburn, and, like 
all the issues of the series, is one of the daintiest of 
unpretentious gift-books. 

" The Mishaps of an Automobilist " (Stokee Co.y 
is a book of comic drawings, in black-and-white and 
in colors, by Mr. DeWitt Clinton Falls, with explan- 
atory verses by Mr. Montrose J. Moses. Here the 
amateur chauffeur will find the tragic accidents that 
beeet his mad career all drawn to the life, in most 
diverting fashion. The pictures are clever and 
amusing ; some of the verses have a touch of real 
humor ; the g^en burlap cover is unique and attrac- 
tive ; and the book as a whole is calculated to pro- 
vide the automobile enthusiast, his friends, and even 
his enemies, with entertainment for a dull half-hoar. 



Books fob thk T'oung. 



Again this year tbere must be entered a general pro- 
test against the lack of original literary quality in the 
books designed for the reading of tboae wbiMe years are 
not vet ripe. To a pecoliar degree th eee Tolanes justify 
the dictam of the late Walter Bagebot, to the effect thai 
the writers of the day are of two classes : those who 
know bow to write, bat have notbiog to say ; and tboae 
who have something to say, but do not know how to 
write. As a partial offset, it most be said that tbere 
have never been so many books pablisbed with a teal 
claim to physical beauty. Few children's books now go 
forth without illustratioas ; indeed, those with pictures 
in color are growing as common as were those with any 
sort of decoration a generation ago. In print and bind- 
ing, also, and in general tastefalness of design, maaj 
of the juveniles of the season deserve high praise. 
Again this year there is noticeable a decrease over the 
last few years in the nomber of children's books dealing 
with war and bloodshed, even stories of the army and 
navy having to do with those neeeaiaiy eriis in times of 
peace rather than those of aetaal eaasbat. Books of 
adventure show a slight increase in number ; those of 
travel in strange lands, a slight decrease, so far as the 
two can be differentiated. There are more books of 
jingles, and seemingly more for the very yoaog. There 
is Botioeable, too, an increasiag specialization in books 
addressed to those of varioas ages ; — where books were 
broadly addressed to children as a whole not so long 
ago, they are now designed for children within more de- 
finite limits as to age. And there is a marked increase 
— surely a sign of the times — in the number of writers 
who appeal to girls alone, from the nursery to young 
womanhood. Among these are several which trace a 
girl's career throngh continnons years, a manner quite 
unknown among the books for boys. The lack of liter-

erary merit which we have noted leads us to give the 
place of honor in our list to a group of books that are 
rewritings or compilations, or attractive new editions, 
rather than to the original compositions of the year. 

Children, as well as their elders, have for 
some time been accustomed to look each 
year for a book of fairy stories from Mr. 
Andrew Lang. These volumes, it will be remembered, 
have been designated by some color or shade of binding, 
from which they have taken their name ; so that we have 
had one year a " Red Fairy Book," the next a " Blue 
Fairy Book," and so on. Whether it is that the tints 
have run out, or the supply of fairy stories, or both, 
this year Mr. Lang has given us " The Book of Ro- 
mance " (Longmans), which contains a number of the 
legends of the Knights of the Round Table, and one or 
two from the Sagas of the North. These are re-told in 
Mr. Lang's attractive manner, and the volume is illus- 
trated in color and in black-and-white by Mr. H. J. 
Ford. — A worthy companion to this is the Rev. A. J. 
Church's " Stories of Charlemagne and the Twelve Peers 
of France, from the Old Romances " (Macmillan). 
Here all the illustrations are in color, from the hand of 
Mr. George Morrow ; while the text does for the chan- 
sons de geste what Mr. Lang has done for Sir Thomas 
Malory. — Third in the group is another of Mr. Walter 
Jerrold's volumes of the " Annals of Fairyland " (Mac- 
millan), specifically termed " The Reign of King Ober- 
on." In the face of the title, most of the contents are 
taken from the folk-lore tales of the Brothers Grimm ; 
but they lose nothing in re-telling. Mr. Charles Robinson 
has made the pictures, in black-and-white with the ex- 
eeption of the frontispiece, which is in color ; and he is 
to be credited also with the cover design, also in color, 
and really beautiful. — At last an edition of the most 
popular and the greatest of all books has been prepared 
especially for the use of younger folk, and it is quite 
likely that an apology is due for not placing at the head 
of this paragraph a mention of •• The Bible for Chil- 
dren" (Century Co.), which has been edited by Mrs. 
Joseph B. Gilder (curiously enough, her name is omitted 
from the title-page, which gives notice only of the in- 
troduction by the Right Rev. Henry C. Potter and the 
preface by the Rev. Francis Brown). The version of 
King James has been used, everything which would lead 
an inquisitive child to ask untoward questions omitted, 
and the narrative pieced together in a skilful manner to 
make a fairly continuous story. Both the Old and New 
Testaments have been drawn on, but not the books known 
to Protestants as Apocryphal, though these would have 
done much toward filling the gap between Jonah and 
the Annunciation. Twenty-fonr reproductions from the 
old masters serve as illustrations, and the entire volume, 
a fine quarto, is handsomely rubricated. Such a work, 
BO performed, has long been much desired. — Mr. Peter 
Newell's " Alice in Wonderland " of last year is now 
followed by his pictured edition of " Through the Look- 
ing Glass " (Harper). A portrait of Mr. Newell serves 
for frontispiece, and it is a pleasure to record the fact 
that for once the genial face of the artist does not in 
any way belie his work. This is all the better because 
this work continually suggests the time-honored pictures 
of Sir John Tenniel in the same behalf, with changes 
which the younger folk, unquestionably the best judges, 

will decide are for the better New editions of Miss 

Aleott's "An Old- Fashioned Girl " and " Little Women " 
have been made (Little, Brown & Co.), the former illus- 
itrated by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith, and the latter by 



Mrs. Alice Barber Stephens. Here again there will be 
some regret among the elders at losing the quaint Teu- 
tonic outline sketches which decorated these books for 
so many years ; but sound artistic judgment must favor 
the more modern treatment, which will commend these 
favorite books to new readers as well as old. — Mr. 
William Wallace Denslow has made a series of designs 
for Clement C. Moore's " The Night before Christmas " 
(Dillingham), every page in multicolor and the text 
lettered in. By shaving the upper lip of the good St. 
Nicholas, Mr. Denslow has made him as American as 
if he had taken out naturalization papers, and droll be- 
yond easy description. It is a pleasure to record the 
steady advance in the delineation of children on the part 
of this conscientious and ingenious artist. 

Quite as much care for the verities has 

fl^nt^uUe. K°°* '"*° ^^^ making of Miss Beulah 
Marie Dix's children's story, " A Little 
Captive Lad " (Macmillan), as into her historical ro- 
mances. The period is that of the expelled Stuarts, 
the small hero a devout royalist in exile under the care 
of an impecunious cavalier. His uncle brings him back 
to England, and the rest of the book is concerned with 
the child's coming to a realization of the identity of his 
real friends. It is a good story. — Mrs. Harriet T. 
Comstock has taken equal pains with " Tower or Throne, 
a Romance of the Girlhood of Elizabeth " (Little, 
Brown & Co), in which she follows the cbecquered ca- 
reer of that great princess during her troubled early 
life. The book gives an excellent picture of the little 

scion of royalty who once wished herself a milkmaid 

Where the previous book stopped with the accession to 
the throne. Miss Eva March Tappan, Ph.D., takes the 
Queen on to the close of her life, in her romance, " In 
the Days of Queen Elizabeth " (Lee & Shepard). Her- 
self an accomplished student of history. Miss Tappan 
has performed a real service in this, the third volume 
of the " Makers of England " series. — " Mayken, an 
Historical Story of Holland for Children " (McClnrg) 
is by Mrs. Jessie Anderson Chase, with illustrations by 
Mr. Troy Kinney and Mrs. Margaret West Kinney. It 
deals with a cheerful little girl in the dark days of the 
Spanish subjugation of that courageous people, and is 
both thrilling and instructive. — Mrs. Harriet T. Corn- 
stock has written another historical story for the young, 
" A Boy of a Thousand Years Ago " (Lee & Shepard), 
which is an authentic account of the youthful Alfred, 
not yet styled " the great." The spirited illustrations 
are by Mr. George Varian. — Another good historical 
tale is " The Story of Joan of Arc, Told by Aunt Kate " 
(Lee & Shepard), in which some small children are 
made to listen to a word-of-mouth narrative from an 
older kinswoman. Mrs. Kate E. Carpenter is the 
author. Miss Amy Brooks has drawn the frontispiece, 
a number of paintings depicting Joan's career have been 
reproduced, and there is an accompanying map of the 
France at that time Mr. John Bennett's skill is suf- 
ficient to make bis account of a young English boy's 
experiences on the island of Manhattan in the days of 
Peter Stuyvesant good reading for either children or 
their elders. It is called " Barnaby Lee " (Century 
Co.), and has excellent illustrations by Mr. Clyde O. 
De Land. — "Under Colonial Colors" (Houghton), is 
the work of Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson, and deals with 
that interesting historical event, the expedition of Ar- 
nold against Quebec Mr. James A. Braden writes 

" Far Past the Frontier " (Saalfield), the time being 
that of the early republic " Marching on Niagara "

— The Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady's story of " In the

-comes to full courage and manhood under the stress of 
his experiences. The pictures, as good as possible of 

their kind, are by Mr. Rnfus F. Zogbaum Of a more 

inclusive sort, giving brief biog^phieg of the great naval 
heroes of Holland, France, and England, and ending with 
our own Farragut, is Mrs. Jessie Peabody Frothingham's

Gustavus Conyngham, a good and successful Revolution- 
ary fighter, of whom most Americans are unaware. 
The story is both a true and a good one, with pictures 

of merit by Mr. Carlton T. Chapman The war of 

1812 in an unusual phase affords a background for Mrs. 
Lucy Meacham Thruston's "Jack and his Island " (Lit- 
tle, Brown & Co.), the refusal to listen to words advo- 
cating peace at the be^nning of the hostilities leading 
to the wrecking of a newspaper office. Maryland is the 
scene of the book, and the engagement that gave birth 
to " The Star-Spangled Banner " forms a part of the 

narrative " The Errand Boy of Andrew Jackson, a 

War Story of 1812 " (Lothrop) is the work of Mr. W. 
O. Stoddard. The young hero is one of the Tennesse- 
Ans upon whom Jackson depended so entirely, and the 
•eeonnt of his services as an aide and at the glorious 
■victory of New Orleans, after some previous dealings 
with Lafitte and his privateersmen, makes entertaining 

reading " Margarita, a Legend of the Fight for the 

Great River " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is the fourth vol- 
ume in the " Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days " 
series by Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney, and is based on 
the struggle for the Mississippi between France and 
Spain. It is a period of which little has been written, 

and is the more welcome on that account The fact 

that the war between the States was indeed a civil war 
gives the tone to Mrs. Mary Tracy Earle's " The Flag 
on the Hill-Top " (Houghton), being an account of the 
Knights of the Golden Circle in southern Illinois and 
of the zeal displayed for the Union by loyal citizens. 
Simply and clearly told, it is to be commended above 

most books of the sort Mr. George Cary Eggleston 

has his boys on the other side of the great war, in " The 
Bale Marked ' Circle X '" (Lothrop), wherein several 
young Confederates run the blockade with a bale of 
cotton in which valuable documents are concealed. It 
is sensational and exciting. — Captain F. S. Brereton, 
.R.A.M.C., tells a story of the Spanish- American war

in " Under the Spangled Banner " (imported by Scrib- 
ner). An English boy plays a prominent part in the 
narrative, which is written primarily for British con- 
sumption. — The Rev. H. H. Clark, a chaplain in the 
American navy, has written " The Admiral's Aid, a 
Story of Life in the New Navy" (Lothrop). Here, 
for once, there is nothing more than the rumor of war, 
with a love-story thrown in. Mr. Clark has quite an 
elaborate defence of the new navy, when setting it down 
once for all as more or less of a necessary evil would 

have covered the entire ground So many accidents 

oeenr and so many lives are saved in Mr. Enrique H. 
Lewis's " Phil and Dick, the Adventures of Two Ap- 
prentices in the American Navy " (Sa&lfield) that it gets 
to be almost humorous. 

Mr. George Alfred Henty, wboae re- 
cent passing away has left a gap in the 
ranks of writers for the young not to be 
filled, has departed from his usual manner in "The 
Treasure of the Incas," where it is not so much fighting 
as looting that occupies the attention of his youthful 
band of Englishmen. This is the first of this year's 
three books from this onoe so busy pen, and has the 
usual good pictures by Mr. Walter Paget. The seeond 
is ■■ With Kitchener in the Sondan," with the battles of 
Atbara and Omdnrman duly celebrated; and the third is 
"With the British Legion, a Story of the Carlist Uprising 
in 1836 " (Scribner). There is no need to particularize 
further in the case of this much regretted author. The 
books are long, and of uniform interest, with a slight 
preference for the Peruvian story. — Of the same sort, 
only shorter, is Mr. John Finnemore's " The Story of a 
Scout " (Lippincott), forcing comparison with Lever bj 
being placed in the activities of the Peninsular War. — 
An old friend, the African gorilla, comes back with Mr. 
Paul Du Chaillu's "King Mombo" (Scribner), an ac- 
count of the wanderings of an American boy in the wild* 
inhabited only by these man-like apes and a number of 
ape-like men. — " The Secret of the Everglades " (im- 
ported by Scribner) is another American story by an 
English author. Miss Bessie Marchant. Two persons 
are lost, father and daughter, and there is a mystery- 
unsolved until the concluding chapter. — A book of con- 
spicuous merit is Mr. Charles Frederick Holder's " The 
Adventures of Torqua" (Little, Brown & Co.), the soo- 
eess being largely due to the anthor's thorough familiarity 
with his subject. Three boys take unwilling refuge on 
the island of Santa Catalina, or Pimug-na, off the coast 
of California, during the later days of the eighteenth 
century, when the native tribes were still flourishing. 
The boys were brave and enterprising, and their adven- 
tures are quite by themselves in nature and extent. — 
Mr. Robert Lloyd begins his story of " The Treasure of 
Shag Rock " (Lothrop) with school athletics, then trans- 
fers the interest to a supposed fortune concealed on one 
of the South Sea islands. A pirate sets out after the 
expedition, and there is war on the high seas. — " The 
Last Cruise of the Electra " (Saalfield) would not have 
been written by Mr. Charles P. Chipman, probably, with- 
out the precedent of the late Jules Verne's " Twenty 
Thousand Leagues under the Sea," of which it is rem- 
iniscent. — Quite another sort of voyage is that described 
by Mr. Jack London in " The Cruise of the Dazzler " 
(Century Co.), where an end is put to ocean depreda- 
tions near San Francisco by well directed effort. The 
pictures are by Mr. M. J. Burns, and the book one of 
unquestioned interest. — The last days of the slave-trade

some excellent sport, combine to give his pages interest 
and value "Cruising on the St. Lawrence ; or, A Sum- 
mer's Vacation in Historic Waters " (Lee & Shepard) 
is another book by Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson, in which 
the boys of the earlier volumes of the " St. Lawrence " 
series, now in their sophomore year at college, learn a 
great deal of history, and even more about the Indians, 

during a pleasant summer's vacation " Jeb Hutton " 

(Seribner) is by Mr. James B. Connolly, and utilizes the 
dredging and other similar work of the United States 
Engineer Corps for a theme. Jeb is a good-natured 
giant of a Southern country boy, and his experiences 
have a certain educational significance for his readers 
as well as for himself. — Mr. Homer Greene's " Pickett's 
Gap " (Macmillan) is a story of modern commercial 
methods, two railways fighting for an outlet through 
the mountain pass owned by the hero's father. It is 
astonishing to find how much excitement can lie within 
so simple a story. 

Boys have long had a monopoly of books 
relating to carpentry and other similar 
work, but " What a Girl Can Make and 
Do " (Seribner), by Miss Lina Beard and Miss Adelia 
B. Beard, daughters of a well-known artist, is likely to 
question their supremacy. There are two parts of the 
book, " What a Girl Can Make " and " What a Girl 
Can Do," and both are suggestive and instructive, and 
exactly the thing to keep young people out of idleness 
on days blue or gray. — Several books in our present 
group seem intended for growing girls, from the period 
of long skirts to that of matrimony. One of these is 
"The Wyndham Girls" (Century Co.), by Mrs. Marion 
Ames Taggart. In this story, a family is brought from 
affluence to an income of a few hundreds a year, a 
reverse which proves to be a real though disguised 
blessing, the girls all finding good husbands, and one of 
the young men getting back a slice of their former for- 
tune for them. — That a woman can keep a secret, and 
even find it profitable to her in the end, is demonstrated 
in " Polly's Secret, a Story of the Kennebec " (Little, 
Brown & Co.), in which Mrs. Harriet A. Nash has 
drawn a pleasant picture of a New England family, 
following her heroine from girlhood into married life. 
— The striking title of " Madge, a Girl in Earnest " 
(Lee & Shepard) is borne out by the spirited tale which 
Miss S. Jennie Smith has made of a self-respecting and 
indomitable young person, who teaches some of her 

kinsfolk a lesson or two worth learning The stern 

need for self-restraint is the lesson taught to a rather 
wilful young girl, in "A Dornfleld Summer" (Little, 
Brown & Co.), by Miss Mary M. Haley. All the girls 
in the book are worth knowing, and the one who makes 
the most mistakes is not the least lovable. — What 
country life can do toward making a good woman out 
of a wretched little city girl is shown by Miss Helen 
M. Winslow, in the cheerful story entitled " Concerning 
Polly and Some Others " (Lee & Shepard). There is 
a bubbling up of Yankee humor all through the book, 
which has been well illustrated by Mr. Charles Cope- 
land Beauty, so long regarded by our Puritan ances- 



tors as a wile and lure of the enemy, makes trouble for 
the pretty Quaker girl whose one striking experience 
is told in " Lois Mallet's Dangerous Gift" (Houghton). 
Miss Mary Catherine Lee places her beautiful heroine 
in New Bedford, and Mr. W. L. Taylor has painted 
her portrait for the frontispiece, a picture which for 
once does not belie the author's description. — " Emmy 
Lou, her Book and Heart " (McClure, Phillips & Co.) 
is a delightful accouut of a little girl who begins in the 
lowest grade of the primary school, and wins her way, 
with mingled tears and smiles, into the high school and 
the first stirrings of attraction for boys and dancing. 
It is the work of " George Madden Martin," who has 
made way into some of the inmost recesses of the 
feminine mind in early girlhood and youth. — Agnes 
Grant has even more trouble coming into her life in 
the book named for her, "Agnes Grant's Education" 
(Jennings & Pye), by Miss Hope Daring. There is a 
strong religious element of the evangelical sort, and 
salvation comes slowly but surely. 

Few stories of school and college appear 
^'■rf '",,*'*°°' this season, and again the best of those 
' ■ for boys is by Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour, 

whose three previous stories have been duly praised in 
these columns. Those were all concerned with a fitting 
school ; the last, " Behind the Line, a Story of College 
Life and Football " (Appleton), deals with two boys 
from the same school, but chiefly after they have en- 
tered one of the smaller colleges. Granted an interest 
in football, Mr. Barbour's story is fascinating, and Mr. 
C. M. Relyea's drawings add to its interest. It is em- 
phatically a book for boys : there is no woman men- 
tioned in it from beginning to end. — The English 
school finds a historian in Mr. Robert Leighton, and he 
has introduced the son of an American multimillionaire 
into " The Boys of Waveney " (Putnam) as the god 
from the machine who straightens up all the entangle- 
ments. The author has the usual trouble in reconciling 
the American dialect, as spoken by this youth, with 
anything ever heard on this side of the Atlantic ; but 

the book is thrilling to the point of melodrama It 

would be difficult to tell why almost all stories of boys 
in college are for the perusal of adults, while the stories 
of their sisters are written to appeal to young girls ; 
but this seems to be the fact. " Brenda's Cousin at Rad- 
cliffe " (Little, Brown & Co.) is another volume in Miss 
Helen Leah Reed's successful series, and it makes a 
very pretty picture of student life. Here, as in similar 
stories, the stress is laid first upon studies, then on so- 
cial life, and finally on recreation ; in the boys' books 
this order is reversed. But it hardly seems needful at 
this time to enter upon a defense of the higher edu- 
cation for women, as Miss Reed does, nor to devote 
several pages to proving that girl students are not un- 
womanly. — Radclifte appears again in Miss Mary G. 
Darling's " A Girl of this Century " (Lee & Shepard). 
It reaches beyond the brilliant college career of the 
heroine, however, takes her into society, and then, upon 
the loss of the family fortune, enables her to put her 
knowledge to the best advantage. — There is a girl, the 
daughter of wealthy and indulgent parents, who does 
not wish to continue her schooling, and she is permitted 
to send a young French girl, the daughter of a painter, 
to school in her stead. It is the delineation of the dif- 
ferences between the American girl and this alluring 
little foreigner, who has been in a convent school in her 
own country, that lends both name and interest to Mrs. 
Myra Sawyer Hamlin's "Catharine's Proxy" (Little, 



1902.]

Brown & Co.) An excellent opportunity is given 

for contrasting quite another sort of education, bv Mrs. 
L. T. Meade's story of " The Rebel of the School " (Lip- 
pincott). The real heroine of the book is a poor girl 
whose beauty and talent win her a leading place in the 
affections of both her teachers and her fellow-pupils in 
a great English school for girls ; while the rebel is a 
wild Irish girl who undertakes to run things with a 
total disregard for rules and precedents. The closing 
chapters are really exciting, and the book is one to be 
read with interest. 

For boys not yet half-way in their 'teens, 
though out of childhood, a number of 
interesting stories hare been devised, 
rather more interesting, upon the whole, than those in- 
tended for their elder brothers. Mr. W. D. Howells's 
Ule of "The Flight of Pony Baker" (Harper) is an 
admirable bit of composition, shoFring that one author, 
at least, has kept bis own boyhood in vivid and grateful 
remembrance. The days are those before the war ; the 
scene is in a little Ohio river town ; and the characters 
are real boys and real girls. Pony Baker decides upon 
flight from his home, and the most admirable humor is 
shown in narrating his various attempts at absconding, 
not one of which becomes known to his unsuspecting 
parents until the book's close ; and even this attempt is 
not carried very far. — Another Ohio boyhood, farther 
to the south than Mr. Howells's and almost a generation 
later in point of time, is delineated bv Mr. William 
Henry Venable in "Tom Tad" (Dodd.'Mead & Co.). 
Questions of social status complicate the situations of 
the book somewhat, and there is a naturalist uncle who 
imparts useful information in palatable form. — Miss 
Murfree (Charles Egbert Craddock) takes up a new 
field in " The Champion " (Houghton), a story of a half- 
grown boy, the "devil " in a newspaper office who ac- 
cidentally hears of a plot to commit crime, sees the 
crime actually committed, and, with all the readiness 
in the world to tell of it, is so intimidated that it is only 
when an innocent man is placed in jeopardy that he 
takes eonrage to reveal what he knows. The interest 
of the book is in the study of character, and it can be 
read with pleasure by any boy's parents as well as by 
any boy. — The points of difference between an athletic 
lad and one given more exclusively to study are admir- 
ably brought out by Miss Evelyn Sharp in her story of 
•' ITie Other Boy " (Macmillan j. It is " an odd sheep " 
in every particular that comes into the family of an 
English painter, bnt he has moral courage where the 
others had known only " pluck," and a healthful re- 
action follows. — A bereaved family left with a sadly 
diminished income is enabled to keep itself in comfort 
through the clever devices of the half-grown children, 
who are unusually gifted, forms the theme of Miss Kath- 
arine Newbold Birdsall's " Jacks of All Trades " (Ap- 
pleton) ; and the book would have been better if she had 
depended a little more on the inherent interest of this 
alone. — It is a bright and active youngster that lends 
his name to " Tom Winston, ' Wide Awake ' " (Lee 
& Shepard), by " Martha James," this last an admitted 
pseudonym. The boy goes to school, is athletic, and is 
the sort of boy we like to know. — "A Struggle for a 
Fortune " (Saalfield), by Mr. Charles Austin Fosdick 
(" Harry Castlemon "), is not the story of a boy who 
earns his way to wealth by any endeavor on his part, 
beyond keeping the father and the brother with whom 
he lives from getting from him a great deal of money 
left him by an old man who was also an inmate of the 



BeokMfm 
gmui gergirU. 



household. The scene is laid in the South, and the 
story is somewhat sensational. — The second volume 
of " Bob Knight's Diary " (Dutton) is specifically 
called " Camping Out," and, like its predecessor, has 
the boy's own sketches. The story is by Mrs. Char- 
lotte Curtis Smith, and the pictures, by whomsoever 
made, are boyish in conception and execution. The 
book is of unquestionable interest to little folk, the 
more so on this last account. — In " Larry Barlow's 
Ambition " (Saalfield), Mr. Arthur M. Winfield tells of 
a youth who gets a position on a metropolitan fire de- 
partment and effects the most exciting rescues of im- 
perilled people, including sometimes himself. — The 
untoward tradition which attaches to the conduct of 
clergymen's children, as well as to the footgear of the 
offspring of shoemakers, is disputed in the Rev. W. W. 
Hooper's "That Minister's Boy "(Brooklyn Eagle Press). 
It is a wholesome and hearty youth that is here de- 
picted, the tale being told by episodes Another pro- 
verb, that of the wise child, is worked out in Mr. 
J. M. Merrill's " His Mother's Letter" (Saalfield). The 
youthful hero is here a long time coming to his own, 
and his experiences are lurid during the process. — 
<* Timothy and his Friends " (Saalfield), the work of 
Mrs. Mary E. Ireland, is the story of a boy's search for 
a father, who does not torn op until the last chapter of 
the book. 

Three pretty little stories for girls of 
" middle size " are told by Miss Nora 
Archibald Smith in " Three Little Marys" 
(Houghton). One of the girls is English, one Scotch, 
and the most alluring one of all is Irish. It is rare 
that national characteristics are hit off so well in a field 
so limited. — Just the sort of little girl that most men 
would like all little girls to be, comes from a Kansas 
home to visit her nncle, a New Tork stock-broker, and 
one of her cousins gives her the soubriquet which pro- 
vides the title for Mrs. Marion Ames Taggart's " Miss 
Lochinvar, a Story for Girls" (Appleton). Those who 
have long thought that Kansas could impart valuable 
information to the devotees of Wall Street can find an 

unexpected verification of it here " Randy and her 

Friends " (Lee & Shepard) is the third of Miss Amy 
Brooks's volumes with a single heroine. In this one, the 
little girl is befriended by an early acquaintance to the 
extent of a term in a private school in Boston, adding 
a new factor to the portraits of quaint rural folk who 
have already made themselves known to the reading 
public. — In this last book. Miss Brooks is both author 
and illustrator ; and so she is in " Dorothy Dainty " 
(Lee & Shepard), in which a model little girl is con- 
trasted with some others not so well behaved, including 
a little waif of the streets. — Grandparenthood has 
always been held to be the most enviable of relation- 
ships, because it carries all the delights of having chil- 
dren with few or none of the responsibilities. In 
"Grandma's Girls" (Little, Brown & Co.), this is only 
partly true, for the author. Miss Helen Morris, has 
there brought two batches of girl cousins together on a 
seaside farm while their respective parents are in 
Europe. The girls have a good time, and their grand- 
mamma proves herself among the wisest of women. — 
" The Yellow Violin " (Saalfield) is a confused story of 
an old-fashioned sort, by Miss Mary A. Denison. There 
are both rich and poor in the story, and the little girl 
who is the principal figure knows them all. — The little 
blind daughter of a family dwelling in city apartments 
is " The Little Girl Next Door" (Lee & Shepard) of

Miss Nina Rhoades's new book. She is made much of 
by the child of a wealthy family living as neighbors in 
the geographical sense, and is eventually discovered to 
be of the gentlest birth. — Miss Anna Cbapin Ray has 
brought into "Nathalie's Chum" (Little, Brown & Co.) 
a number of the characters from " Teddy, her Book," 
and has made a good story of the life led by a young 
man who is compelled to be both father and brother to 
four youngsters. — Some of the difiiculties of bringing 
up a child who is unwilling to assist in the process are 
painted by Miss Edna A. Foster in " Hortense, a Dif- 
ficult Child " (Lee & Shepard). Hortense is a little 
girl placed under the care of a maiden aunt with a fixed 
theory about the rearing of children, and it is not 
the unexpected that happens. — Those who know Mrs. 
Martha Finley's " Elsie " books will welcome " Elsie's 
Winter Trip " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), in which the child 
goes to the West Indies on a private yacht and has a 
very good time indeed. — " The Little Woman in the 
Spout " (Saalfield) is the name given by two or three 
little folk to a " make-believe " person in Miss Mary 
Agnes Byrne's book, wherein a child mistreated comes 
into unexpected wealth. — The same author gives us 
" Roy and Rosyrocks " (Saalfield), with much the same 
ending, only two children are here brought to the arms 
of an unlooked-for uncle and aunt. 

A few books remain, designed for the 
smaller children of both sexes. Of these 
the " Just So Stories " (Doubleday, Page 
& Co.) of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, both text and illus- 
trations from the same hand, is most likely to arrest 
attention ; and yet the book is somehow a disappoint- 
ment. The most desirable portions of the text are 
those describing the pictures, and these little descrip- 
tions are not such as appeal to the young. There is a 
roughness of workmanship about the book as a whole 
that detracts from the virtues of even the best of the 
stories, that of the cat. — Mr. R. W. Chambers appears 
in a new field in his " Outdoorland " (Harper), in which 
stories of nature are profusely and beautifully illus- 
trated for small children Bright and witty are the 

experiences embodied by Miss Gertrude Smith in " The 
Lovable Tales of Janey and Josey and Joe" (Har- 
per), with many illustrations by Misses E. Mars and 
M. H. Squire. The title is fully descriptive. — A col- 
lection of animal stories from Indian folk-lore have 
been told by Mrs. Therese O. Deming, with numerous 
pictures of more than ordinary value by Mr. Edwin 
Willard Deming, under the title of " Red Folk and Wild 
Folk " (Stokes). The book has unusual merit in every 
respect. — " Billy Whiskers " (Saalfield) is the title of 
an illustrated history of a guileful goat, written by Mrs. 
Frances Trego Montgomery. The book is broadly hu- 
morous, including the illustrations. — The "Chatterbox " 
appears in the customary bound volume for 1902 (Estes). 
Nothing more likely to please the average child is put 
forth, and the new number does not fall behind in any 
respect. — Close beside the foregoing is " Sunday Read- 
ing for the Young, 1903" (E. & J. B. Young), a mis- 
cellany for the very young. 

Fairy tales rightly continue to hold the 
attention of the young. One of the 
really charming books of the season is 
" In the Green Forest " (Little, Brown & Co.), toth 
text and pictures by Miss Katharine Pyle. Two fair- 
ies. Red Cap and Nightshade, set out to find the palace 
of the Sua Queen. Nightshade, as his name goes to 
show, makes trouble and to spare. The narrative is

the/airies. 



interesting, the pictures are admirable. — In the man- 
ner of Hans Andersen, the " Fairy Tales from the 
Swedish " (Stokes) have been translated from the orig- 
inal of the Baron Djurko by Mr. H. L. Breekstad, with 
numerous illustrations from Swedish artists of emi- 
nence. The stories are uniformly simple and sweet, 
arresting the attention of any reader. — One of the 
most beautiful child's books of the season is Mrs. Cor- 
nelia Baker's " Coquo and the King's Children " 
(McCIurg), with six illustrations in color by Mrs. Lucy 
Fitch Perkins. Coquo is the court jester and the 
leader of the little prince and princess in their esca- 
pades. All manner of fairies meet them on their ram- 
bles, but nothing quenches Coquo's unfortunate habit 
of punning. — Another beautiful volume is " Kallisto 
and Other Tales of the Fairies " (Little, Brown & Co.), 
by Mr. William Dana Orcutt, with numerous decora- 
tions and pictures in color by Miss Harriette Amsden. 
Good use is here made of both northern and classical 
mythology in constructing a story of considerable 
merit. — Seven fairy tales by Mrs. Edith Odgen Har- 
rison are given the title of " Prince Silverwings " 
(McClurg). Toid originally to the author's children,, 
these little narratives have a spontaneity and freshness- 
that commend them at once. The book is handsomely 
decorated in color by Mrs. Lucy -Fitch Perkins. — 
There is a reversal of the process just mentioned in the 
book called " In Happy Far-Away Land " (Zimmer- 
man), where the stories were told by Mrs. France* 
Palmer Kimball to her daughter, Mrs. Ruth Kimball 
Gardner, and have been set down in riper years from 
the vivid memories of childhood. It is a pious labor 
and one tenderly performed. The illustrations are by 

Mr. Howard Smith Abandoning historical novels for 

a time. Miss Mary Imlay Taylor has written " Little 
Mistress Good Hope and Other Fairy Tales" (McClurg) 
with her accustomed sprightliness and interest. The 
inspiration here is from English provincial folk-lore, 
and the colored plates by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith 
add to the reader's understanding of the stories. — A 
wonder-tale of swinging away from this old earth and 
visiting the other planets has been told by Mr. P. L. 
Gray in a prettily bound book styled " In a Car of 
Gold" (Saalfield). — Miss Carolyn Wells has writteo 
two books of fairy stories or their modern equivalents. 
The former of these, " Folly in the Forest " (Altemus), 
is in a manner a sequel to the author's " Folly in Fairy- 
land " of last year, but here the little heroine is made 
to meet all the mythological and historical beasts and 
either sing to them or listen to their singing. The 
songs are very funny, and so are those in Miss Wells's 
second book, "The Pete and Polly Stories: A Book 
of Nonsense Prose and Verse" (McClurg). Miss 
Fanny Young Cory has drawn some delicious pictures 
for these extraordinary adventures, which are wild 
enough to be interesting to any child, and to his parents 
as well. 

Mr. James Whitcomb Riley has joined 
the little army of poets laureate to their 
royal highnesses the coming generation, 
following the good example of Robert Louis Steven- 
son. " The Book of Joyous Children " (Scribner) 
has been illustrated copiously with both full-page and 
text drawings by Mr. J. W. Vawter, and is in every 
respect a handsome book. But it contains no children's 
poems at all equal to some of the author's earlier lines, 
" Little Orpbaut Annie " for example, full though the 
book is of pleasant songs and jingles. The most inter-

eating feature in it (though at first blush it seems oat 
of place in such a volume) is the chapter devoted to 
imitations of several of the greater poets. — Miss Abbie 
Farwell Brown has come nearer to the spirit of Steven- 
son in some of the numbers of " A Pocketful of Posies " 
(Houghton), and Miss Fannj Young Cory has made 
most appropriate designs to accompany them. A pleasant 
and novel feature are the marginal annotations in red 
with every stanza, adding g^atly to the humorous 
effect. — Mr. William Wallace Whitelock is known as 
the writer of graceful and witty vers de lociete in " Life " 
and similar publications. To those familiar with these 
clever trifles, "When the Heart is Young" (Dutton) 
will be a disappointment. It is conventional, little 
witty, and not in the least poetical. Mr. Harper Pen- 
nington's drawings are better. — In welcoming a new 
edition of Mr. Peter Xewell's " Topsys and Turvys " 
(Century Co.) in a volume made up by taking from its 
two predecessors the best things they contained, it is 
worth while calling attention to the exceedingly witty 
lines that accompany the drawings in color, those won- 
derful drawings that make a picture seem one thing 
when looked at one way and quite another when re- 
versed. One does not always think of Mr. Newell as a 
writer of verses, but be certainly knows how to combine 

effectively his two distinct varieties of cleverness 

"Six and Twenty Boys and Girls" (imported by Scrib- 
ner) is reminiscent of the immortal " Slovenly Peter " 
and of Mr. Gelett Burgess's " Alphabet of Famous 
Goops," but Mr. Clifton Bingham's verses and Mr. 
John Hassall's colored drawings have merits of their 
own. As the title indicates, there is a boy or girl for 
each of the twenty-six letters, and some of these child- 
ren are very good indeed, and some are bad enough to 
be horrid. — "Animal Life" (Saalfield) has many of 
its illustrations taken from older plates, while the 
rhymes of Miss Elizabeth May are more rhymes than 
anything else, dealing with a number of our animal 
friends. — Animals again lend interest to " Game* and 
Gambols" (imported by Scribner), the verses by Mr. 
John Brymer and the colored drawings by Mr. Harry 
B. Neilson. The books by these collaborators are 
already familiar, the attraction in them coming from 
the placing of birds and beasts in human situations 
more or less comical. — " The Bogey Book " (Young) 
is a novelty in size, which is that of a large thin folio, 
the rhymes by " E. S." and the pictures by " R. J. S." 
Both would be appalling if they were not so wholly 

grotesque Really interesting, and an unexpected 

proof of the versatility of Mrs. Laura £. Richards, is 
"The Hurdy Gurdy " (Elstes), with its surprising dedi- 
cation " To Adams Sherman Hill, Arthur Dehon Hill, 
Adams Sherman Hill, Three Generations of Agreeable 
Boys." The illustrations are by Mr. J. J. Mora. The 

book is worth while The year would not be quite 

complete without something from the Misses Upton 
with a topic entirely up to date. So " The Golliwogg's 
Air Ship " (Longmans), the jingles by Miss Bertha Up- 
ton and the colored plates by Miss Florence R. Upton, 
is to be welcomed as fully equal to the former volumes 
of a veracious history, as amusing as possible to thoM 

for whom it is intended In a class quite by itself for 

novelty and potential entertainment is Mr. J. M. Bar- 
nett's "Mother Goose Paint Book" (Saalfield), the 
text from an approved edition of that classic, the pic- 
tures in outline, and five cakes of paint of different 
colors and a camel's hair pencil on the inner side of the 
back cover, readv for use.

and Architecture," by Mr. P. H. Ditchfield, is an illus- 
trated work of guide-book scope published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. The illustrations are particularly suc- 
cessful, being the work of a group of well-known artists. 

" Harper's Cook Book Encyclopedia," compiled un- 
der the direction of the editor of " Harper's Bazar," is 
a thick volume with dictionary arrangement of contents, 
and, if not exactly literature itself, is calculated to pro- 
mote both the production and the enjoyment of litera- 
ture. 

" Four Addresses by Henry Lee Higginson " make

istration," by Dr. William MacDonald, is a volume in 
the " Handbooks of American Government " published 
by the Maemillan Co. As adjuncts to the teaching of 
American history and government in our schools, this 
series should command sufficient support to warrant its 
extension until it includes a volume for every State in

that they have been made into a little book, with illus- 
trations by Mr. John T. McCutcheon. Messrs. Forbes 
& Co. are the publishers. 

Browning's " Rabbi Ben Ezra," with some editorial 
matter by Mr. W. A. Slade, and " The Elegy of Faith," 
being an essay on Tennyson's " In Memoriam " by Mr. 
William Rader, are two small holiday books printed in 
heavy-faced type with ornaments in red, and published 
by Messrs. T. Y. Ciowell & Co. 

" The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," by Rudolph 
Eric Raspe (how many could have named the author 
off hand ?), and Johanna Spyri's " Heidi," translated by 
Miss Helene S. White, are published by the Messrs. 
Crowell in their series of " Children's Favorite Classics," 
with illustrations, including colored frontispieces. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. send us seven new 
volumes of their " What Is Worth While " booklets. 
Among them are Storm's "Immensee"; a collection 
of " Daily Maxims from Amiel's Journal," edited by 
Mr. Orline Gates ; " If I Were a College Student," by 
President Thwing ; and "The Cardinal Virtues," by 
President Hyde. 

Three new volumes of the " Temple Bible " are on 
our desk. The books of Joshua and Judges, edited by 
Dr. A. R. S. Kennedy, and the later Pauline epistles, 
edited by the Bishop of Durham, are two of them ; the 
third is " An Introduction to the Study of the Scrip- 
tures," by the Bishop of Ripon. The J. B. Lippincott 
Co. are the publishers. 

" An Ancient History for Beginners " (Macmillan), 
by Dr. George Willis Botsford, is designed for the first 
year of high school work as planned by the Committee 
of Seven. The success of the author's previously pub- 
lished text-books has been very marked, and the new 
work is no less deserving of commendation. In point 
of both illustration and typography the book presents 
a very handsome appearance, and the student may count 
himself fortunate who is given it for a daily companion.

OURS is the largest establishment in this country 
devoted exclusively to books and stationery. 
Above all it is the ideal place for holiday book buying, 
as the stock is so complete that patrons can be practi- 
cally assured of finding any publication desired without 
inconvenient delay. 

From now on every facility of our retail department 
— every convenience and assistance that we can offer — 
is at the entire disposal of customers who are engaged 
in the perplexing selection of books for holiday presen- 
tation. Patrons from out of town will appreciate the 
comfortable reading-room where catalogues may be 
consulted, books examined, letters written, or appoint- 
ments kept as desired. 

In regard to the desirability of books as Christmas 
gifts, nothing else is likely to give the same amount of 
pleasure at a relative cost. And it may be added that 
never before has the array of holiday books been so 
beautiful, so varied, and so altogether attractive from 
every standpoint. This is particularly true of the books 
for young people, which seem to have been the subject 
of special effort on the part of the publishers this season.

THE ART OF SUCCESS 

By T. Sharper Knowlson. In 12mo, cloth, gilt, gilt top, flat back, price $1.00. \* Prospectus free on application. 

Encouraged by the hearty reception of " The Art of Thinking," Mr. Knowlson has now written a supplementary volume called ** The Art of 
Success," which is intended as a guide to action, as the former volume was a guide to thought. It is shown that much depends on the abilities 
and character of the man ; and stress is laid upon moral qualities in particular. Luck, originality, limitations, and the increasing difficulty of 
success are all dealt with at length, and practical illustrations of successful action are given.

AN IMPORTANT WORK BY THE BOER CHIEFTAIN 

Three YEARS' War 

By Christiaan Rudolf de Wet 

IVitb frontispiece poftrait by John S. Sargent, R.A., 
together with plans, map, etc. $2. ^o net (postage 28c.) 

THIS Is the plain, blufl', unvarnished story of General de Wet's experiences 
and doings in the great struggle which took place between the Boer 
and the Briton. The simplicity of the narrative, its sincerity, ib* soldierly 
fairness, and its unconscious eloquence, will make the book appeal to all 
men who enjoy a story of action; while the light it throws upon military 
operations and battles hitherto known only from the English view-point, 
gives it a genuine historical value.

A History of the 
American People 

IN FIVE VOLUMES 




By WOODROW WILSON, Ph.D., Litt.D., LL.D. 

President of Princeton University 

PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSOX has devoted the best rears of his life to the preparation of his 
'' great work, "A History of the Americao People," from the earliest times to the accession of Theodore 
Roosevelt. The work, which is just completed, is monumental in character and scope, represents the 
genius of the greatest historical thinker of modem times, and is written in that delightfnllj flowing style 
which makes it read like a romance. It is printed from new typte specially cast in 1902. In the matter 
of illustration, every field of human activity has been searched, and hundreds upon hundreds of new 
portraits, prints, maps, plans, and pictures make the pictorial features alone tell their wonderful story of 
the finding of the continent and the birth and growth of what is the United States of America. There 
is a photograrnre frontispiece to each volume, and portraits in India tint and black. It is a curious fact 
that there is not a single complete narrative history of the United States in existence today. Dr. Woodrow 
Wilson's is the first. It is bound in dark blue vellum cloth, leather-stamped, lettered with gold, 
untrimmed edges, gilt tops, etc. The edition is in five rolumes and the price is $25.00.

Japan and Her People 

By ANNA C. HARTSHORNE. 

Illustrated with fifty photogravures. 

Two volumes. Crown 8vo. Cloth extra, gilt top ; in cloth box. $4.00 net. 

Miss Hartshorne writes of Japan and the Japanese people from an intimate knowledge of 
her subject at first hand, having been a resident of the country and brought closely into 
touch with native life. The book will take rank as a thorough exposition of the Island 
Kingdom, and is written in a charming style. No more attractive holiday book will be 
issued this season.

Based on the Work of Tissot. 

By MARIA HORNOR LANSDALE. 

Illustrated with twenty-five photogravures and a map. 
Crown 8vo. Cloth extra, gilt top; in cloth box. $2.40 net. 

Vienna is in many respects the most fascinating and brilliant city in Europe. Miss 
Lansdale has handled the theme with her accustomed skill, making one of the most readable 
books of the year. The fine photogravures are quite equal to the others that have made the 
whole series so noteworthy and popular.

Whimlets 



By SAMUEL SCOTT STINSON. Pictured by Clare Victor Dwiggins. 
Square 12mo. 80 cents net. By mail, 88 cents. 

This little book is uniform with Mr. Matthewman's " Crankisms," and consists of 100 
humorous, sometimes satirical, rhymed conceits embodied in Mr. Dwiggins's inimitable 
drawings. In '-Crankisms" the artist gained a reputation by the unusual and genuine 
illustrative ability displayed in picturing Mr. Matthewman's keen satire, as well as by the 
grace and beauty of his drawings, and in "Whimlets" he has rendered the same services for 
Mr. Stinson's clever conceits. 

If you have "CRANKISMS" get "WHIMLETS" also; if you have not seen 

" CRANKISMS " get them both.

MUSIC AND CULTURE. 



Those writers who engage in the discussion 
of the delicate sabject of caltare seem to take 
it for granted that the printed page is what 
chiefly concerns their theme. It is undoubt- 
edly true that among the agencies of culture 
literature occupies the foremost place, and that 
it is mainly by means of books that we come 
to know the best that has been thought and 
done in the world. But there are other agencies 
as well, and they must not be left out of the 
reckoning. There are, for example, such things 
as travel through lands associated with past 
human achievements, participation in commem- 
orative exercises and civic festivals, and per- 
sonal intercourse with the high-minded men 
who keep the torch of idealism alight from 
generation to generation. There are also the 
fine arts other than literature ; for it is a very 
one-sided and contracted culture that ignores 
the immense contribution made by sculpture 
and painting, by architecture and music, to the 
treasure-house of man's creation. 

With all that may be urged in behalf of the 
other forms of what is called fine art, it seems 
to us that music must, on the whole, be given 
the place next in importance to that occupied 
by literature among the agencies of culture. 
Even graphic art, with all its manifestations 
in color and line, with all its modes of multi- 
plication for the service of the many, seems to 



456 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



us less important than music as the expression 
of the human spirit, and less potent as a source 
of that "joy in widest commonalty spread" 
which art alone is capable of diffusing. But 
coupled with this belief of ours in the power of 
music for the purposes of culture there has 
always been the feeling that its possibilities 
were very dimly realized and its mission very 
imperfectly fulfilled. This is not so much 
because of any failure of music to secure its 
requisite share of our attention as because of 
the thoughtless if not wilfully perverse attitude 
toward the art which is too often assumed by 
those who should know better. 

There is clearly no reason for saying that 
music is neglected in our modern life. When 
we consider the part that it plays in religious 
exercises and public gatherings of every sort, 
its serviceable function in the school and the 
family, we may not fairly bring that charge 
against it. Does not the humblest home boast 
its piano or cabinet organ, and do not the 
daughters of the household take what they call 
"vocal" or "instrumental" in "studio" and 
" conservatory," and afterwards make ruthless 
exhibition of their accomplishments? And 
yet — the question is of the gravest import — 
one cannot help asking if all this activity, all 
the expenditure of money and energy which 
this involves, really makes for culture. For 
entertainment is one thing, and social accom- 
plishment is another thing, and culture is a 
third Ihing, quite different from either. From 
considerable observation and inquiry it seems 
to us that the two former aims obscure the 
latter to an extent that should be the cause of 
much concern. To cultivate music primarily 
for the amusement of one's friends or for the 
enhancement of one's social value is to deal 
unworthily with a noble art and to miss a 
means of self-development which has few equals 
and perhaps no superior when viewed in its 
relation to the totality of the individual — 
intellect, emotion, and character. 

What should we think of literature if it 
were studied in the spirit with which most 
young people — not of their own motion, but 
because they are so taught — approach the study 
of music? Imagine the study of literature so 
narrowed that it should mean nothing more 
than the mechanical art of reading aloud, and 
of constant practice in reading selected trivial- 
ities to one's friends. Think of setting before 
young people such an ideal of literature as that, 
an ideal which would deal with literature as if 
it were a collection of " pieces to speak " and 



not the refined expression of the human spirit 
in all ages. To advance this supposition is to 
make manifest it absurdity, yet something not 
unlike this is what we commonly do in the case 
of music. Here also is an expression of the 
human spirit perhaps as rich and varied and 
potent for the uplifting of the soul as the other, 
and we allow ourselves to fall into the habit 
of regarding music as a collection of " pieces 
to play " or to sing. The young student of 
piano-playing spends weary years in acquiring 
facility of execution, and never dreams that 
this technique is not an end in itself, but sim- 
ply the means to an end — that learning to 
read is only a preliminary necessity, and does 
not touch upon the purpose of a rational pur- 
suit of the culture obtainable through music. 
For this exaltation of accident at the ex- 
pense of substance there is a complex of causes 
not easily analyzed. The case may be cleared 
up in part by specifying a few such things as 
the personal vanity of most students, the com- 
mercialism which actuates many teachers and 
institutions for the training of musicians, and 
the general apathy of the public toward the 
serious aspects of musical art. The whole 
environment of the average young person en- 
gaged in the study of music is such as to endow 
him with false ideals and to obscure the nobler 
aims of the art to which he is giving his best 
energies. He is taught to perform compositions 
merely for the sake of playing them, and with- 
out being helped to understand either their 
spiritual message or their place in the history 
of music. He is forced to play a few things 
with wearisome iteration instead of being en- 
couraged to play many things without greatly 
caring whether or not they are well played. In 
fact, if he shows signs of the habit of browsing 
in the musical library, he is severely discour- 
aged, although browsing in music, as in litera- 
ture, is one of the most helpful of practices, 
and can do what no amount of formal teaching 
can do for the growing mind. At home and 
among his friends, he is placed on exhibition 
upon every possible occasion, and at every stage 
of his progress, thus strengthening him in the 
misconception that his study is not being pur- 
sued at all as a means of culture, but as a means 
of supplying diversion for the social circle. 
This point of view, although absolutely destruc- 
tive of the culture-mission of music, is adopted 
only too readily by the average young person in 
the average non-musical environment, and the 
final stage of degradation is reached when he 
deliberately adapts himself to the taste, or the

THE DIAL

tastelessness, of his audience, and, instead of 
giving the best that is in his power, gropes 
upon the lower level of the imagined likings of 
his hearers. Those who are thus false to the 
light that is in them are to be found among 
musicians of all ranks, and their number 
includes finished artists as well as immature 
students of the art. The prostitution of music 
to this ignoble ministry is very common, and is 
one of the most discouraging features of the 
general situation. 

It has always seemed to us that the publishers 
of music might do much more than they have 
done to encourage the student to study music 
as he would study literature. Nothing is more 
common than to discover that the performer of 
some famous composition has no intelligent 
notion of where it stands among the composer's 
works or of its relation to the historical devel- 
opment of the art. One may be a brilliant 
player of the sonatas of Beethoven and, except 
for the mnemonic jog of the opus numbers, 
have but a dim notion of where a given sonata 
belongs in the development of the master. One 
may bring much musical training to the con- 
cert hall, and listen to the symphony or the 
oratorio without in the least understanding 
whether the work in question was written early 
or late in the composer's career, or what it 
represents in the history of music. Among 
opera-goers, whether they are musicians or not, 
the same confusion exists, although opera is the 
branch of musical composition whose develop- 
ment is the easiest to understand. Not to 
know, for example, that Weber came before 
Wagner — that he must have come before 
Wagner — is like being ignorant of the fact 
that Lessing was a predecessor of Goethe. 
Not to realize the artistic abyss that lies be- 
tween the second and fifth symphonies of Bee- 
thoven or between Verdi's " Rigoletto " and 
'' Otello " is like failing to realize the like dis- 
tinction between " Comus " and " Paradise 
Lost " or between Romeo and Hamlet as heroes 
of tragedy. In the literary cases here adduced 
we should call it blank and inexcusable ignor- 
ance of elementary matters ; but in the mus- 
ical cases it would not be difficult to find 
musicians with long years of training who would 
regard such mistiness of view as a thing of 
trifling importance. Even with the musician 
who makes a specialty of the interpretation of 
some one composer, it will not infrequently be 
found that he is without a systematic view of 
that composer's artistic development : that he 
cannot tell which compositions follow which 



others, and why, or which belong in the same 
group, and why ; that his acquaintance with his 
own chosen master is on a par with the knowl- 
edge of the Shakespearian reciter or elocu- 
tionist, and not with the knowledge of the tme 
Shakespearian student. 

We have said that the publishers of music 
might extend their usefulness in this matter 
of musical education with a view to culture 
rather than to performance, and the impulse 
which led ns to the foregoing discussion was, 
in fact, provided by a publishing enterprise 
that has recently been inaugurated by the Oli- 
ver Ditson Co. In the preparation of their 
" Musicians' Library," of which the initial vol- 
umes have just appeared, these publishers have 
nndertaken " to include all the masterpieces of 
song and piano music ; to gather into beanti- 
fully made volumes of uniform size and bind- 
ing the best work of the best composers, edited 
by living men of authority." Here at last we 
are to have an extensive series of books of 
music to which are applied the methods with 
which we are familiar in books of literature ; 
we are to have musical works accompanied by 
portraits, biographies, and critical discussions, 
their selections dated and chronologically ar- 
ranged, their contents accurately reproduced 
from standard texts, and provided, in the case 
of the volumes of song, with the exact words 
of the original and with English translations 
of literary quality. The two volumes now at 
hand are " Fifty Master Songs," edited by 
Mr. Henry T. Finck, and " Forty Piano Com- 
positions of Frederic Chopin," edited by Mr. 
James Hnneker. Some two score additional 
volumes are in course of preparation, among 
which we note, as particularly attractive, four 
volumes of " Songs from the Operas," edited 
by Mr. Frank Damrosch ; four volumes of 
" The Lyrics of Richard Wagner," edited by 
Mr. Carl Armbruster, besides the song and 
piano albums devoted to single composers, 
and edited by such men as Messrs. H. E. 
Krehbiel, Philip Hale, W. F. Apthorp, and 
W. J. Henderson. This enterprise is so en- 
tirely in the right direction and so clearly 
embodies the right principles of music publi- 
cation that we extend to it a most cordial wel- 
come, and believe that it will become an effi- 
cient agency in promoting musical culture in 
the sense in which that term has been used in 
the above discussion. Here are books of music 
that are not made for the performer alone, but 
are as nearlv as possible like other books, and 
may claim the same place in the library.

A VlKW OF SkVENTEENTH-CKNTURY 

France.* 



A lively account of French society and the 
French court in the first half of the seventeenth 
century is furnished by M. Arvede Barine's 
" La Grande Mademoiselle." As explained by 
the dates on the title-page, and also by the 
running title in the body of the book, it is 
only the youth of Mademoiselle that we have 
to do with in this volume. The author takes 
leave of her forty-one years before her death, 
but his closing words give promise of a sec- 
ond volume at no distant date. In another 
respect, too, the main title of the book might 
be criticized as deceptive : our heroine's affairs 
occupy but a small part of the 436 pages the 
work contains, her life serving rather as a 
handy string to fasten together a miscellaneous 
mass of material illustrating the manners and 
customs of her age. The writer so crowds his 
stage with other characters, — Richelieu, Maz- 
arin, Marie de Medicis, Anne of Austria, 
Cond^, Turenne, kings, princes, and a host of 
lords and ladies, — as greatly to obscure his 
intended star. Mademoiselle's own memoirs, 
of course, afford the historian an important, 
though often untrustworthy, source of informa- 
tion. He supplements them with many con- 
temporary letters and memoirs, sometimes 
giving his authorities in a footnote, but oftener 
leaving them to the reader's conjecture. Nor 
is there any bibliography provided, although a 
reasonably full index — which it is not improb- 
able that we owe wholly to the translator — is 
found at the end. 

These allowances being made, the book has 
much to commend it. The age in which 
Mademoiselle de Montpensier lived is regarded 
by the author as one of transition. The " Chris- 
tian pessimism of Racine," succeeding the 
♦' stoical optimism of Corneille," he looks upon 
as exemplifying a marked transformation 
wrought at this period in the moral atmos- 
phere of France. The five chapters of the 
book are five studies in as many phases of 
seventeenth-century life, — education in the 
early part of the century ; public manners as 
influenced by the salon ; the theatre ; the state 
of religion ; the Fronde. These are the main

topics, while around them are grouped count- 
less subsidiary matters. 

We note, in the first chapter, the little es- 
teem in which education was held by the 
nobility and gentry. People of quality regarded 
books and writing as the tools of plebeians, 
good enough for professional fine wits and 
lawyers' clerks, but not fit for their betters. 
The education of women was, of course, a con- 
spicuously minus quantity. An illustrative 
extract from our heroine's correspondence is 
almost incredible in its orthographic vagaries 
— to use a contradiction in terms. The rude- 
ness of manners, too, even of court manners, 
passes belief. The corridors and stairways of 
the Louvre were put to uses that forbid de- 
scription. The semi-barbaric housekeeping 
practised by royalty fairly astounds one. When 
the king invited distinguished guests, he never 
furnished their rooms. He offered them four 
bare walls and bade them provide for their own 
comfort as best they could. Banquets, we read, 
" were given in the corridor, in the aalle, in the 
ante-room, or in the sleeping-room, because 
literary intuition was undeveloped." (A rather 
curious non sequitur.') As illustrating the man- 
ners of the " gentle," take the following : 

"Once upon a time, at a dance, Comte de Br^gis, 
having received a slap from his partner, turned upon 
her and pulled her hair down in the midst of the banquet. 
At a supper, in the presence of a great and joyous 
company, the Marquis de la Case snatched a leg of 
mutton from a trencher and buffeted his neighbor in 
her face, smearing her with gravy. As she was a lady 
of an even temper, she laughed heartily, and the inci- 
dent was closed. Malherbe confessed to Madame de 
Rambouillet that he had ■ cuSed the ears of the Vis- 
countess d'Auchy until she had cried for aid.' As he 
was a jealous man, his action was not without cause, 
and in that day to flog a woman was a thing that any 
gentleman felt free to do." 

Great need, in truth, was there of the refin- 
ing influence of the Precieuses, and of the 
salon as instituted by Madame de Rambouillet. 
The pranks of her guests began to assume a 
less brutal form than slugging and hair-pulling. 
The Comte de Guiche, after a hearty supper 
of mushrooms, awoke the next morning to find 
his clothes much too small for him. Convinced 
that his indulgence had wrought his undoing, 
he thought his last hour was come. But his 
friends took pity on him in time to save his life 
by explaining that some merry rogue had caused 
all the mischief with needle and thread while 
the victim of the joke was asleep. 

The condition of the theatre and the state of 
the church are treated at some length, with 
interesting iUnstrative matter. The move-

'ineDts of the Fronde, with special reference to 
Mademoiselle's participation therein, claim the 
last hundred pages of the book. The rescue of 
Conde by opening the city gates to him when 
hard pressed by Turenne, after the battle of 
the Faubourg St. Antoine, is ascribed wholly 
to our heroine, in accordance with the claims 
-made by her in her memoirs. With her flight 
from Paris, upon the downfall of the Fronde, 
this account of her youth, and of her persever- 
ing but unsuccessful quest for a royal husband, 
is brought to a close. 

It is rather a distant acquaintance with this 
energetic and self-assertive lady that the reader 
gains. Such portraiture as the author ven- 
tures upon is somewhat feeble in tint and hazy 
in outline. At one time Mademoiselle appears 
■as a decidedly unlovely person with the bearing 
of a Cossack, at another as a marvel of spright- 
liness and beauty. Perhaps this is true to life, 
■however, on the principle of the Virgilian adage 
concerning the mutability of woman. An 
amusingly frank bit of self-portrayal is worth 
quoting here from her own pen. 

" I am t&ll ; I am neither fat nor lean ; I hare a 
graceful and freely moring figure, and mv bearing is 
natural and easr. Mj bust is well formed. My hands 
and feet are not beautiful, but there is great beauty in 
their flesh, and the flesh of my throat is very pretty. 
My leg is straight, and my foot is weU formed. My 
hair is beautiful ash-blonde. My face is long, and ite 
^WDtour is fine. The nose is large and aquiline. The 
mouth neither large nor little, but distinctly outlined 
and of a very agreeable form. The lips are the color 
of Termilion. My teeth are not handsome, but neither 
are they horrible. My eye5 are blue, neither large nor 
small, bat brilliant, gentle, and prond, like my mien. 
I have a haughty, but not self-glorified air; I am polite 
and familiar, but of a manner to excite respect rather 
than to attract the lack of it. ... I may say withont 
boasting that I become whatever I put on better than 
anything I put on becomes me. . . . Nothing breaks 
me down; nothing fatigues me; and it is di£Bcnlt to 
jodge of the events and the changes in my fortunes by 
my face, for my face rarely shows any change. I had 
forgotten to say that I have a healthy complexion, 
which is in accord with what I have just said. My tint 
is not delicate, but it is fair, and very bright and clear." 

The two portraits given in the book (from 
what originals we are not informed) tend 
rather to confirm than to refute this testimony. 
An item of some importance concerning the 
death of Marie de Medicis may be worth men- 
tioning. Contradicting the commonly accepted 
report of her death in a garret in Cologne, in 
the utmost poverty, the author contends, but 
still withont giving chapter and verse for it, 
that she died in a house formerly occupied by 
Rubens, and that at least eighty servants sur- 
rounded her death bed. T'^is latter he infers 



from the list of her legatees. " To the day of 
her death," he adds, " the aged Queen retained 
possession of silver dishes of all kinds, and had 
her situation justified the rumours of extreme 
poverty which have been circulated since then, 
she would have pawned them or sold them." 

The author's diligence in getting together 
such a mass of material and making so reada- 
ble, and in some respects valuable, a book out 
of it, is worthy of praise. If its length seems 
somewhat fatiguing in the translation, that may 
be partly the reader's fault in not having been 
bom a Frenchman. Now and then a racy bit 
of character-sketching enlivens the narrative. 
What could be more delicious than this picture 
of the jaunty and irresponsible Gaston, Duke 
of Orleans, the father of our heroine ? 

« His vivacity was extraordinary. The people mar- 
velled at his unfailing lack of tact. Though very young, 
be was well grown. He was no longer a child whose 
nurse caught him with one hand, forcibly buttoning his 
apron as he struggled to run away ; yet he skipped and 
gambolled, spinning incessantly on his high heels, his 
hand thrust into his pocket, his cap over one ear. . . . 
He carried out his cowardice with impudence, and his 
villainy was artful and adroit. However base his ac- 
tion, he was never troubled by remorse. He was insen- 
sible to love, and devoid of any sense of honour. Having 
betrayed his associates, he abandoned them to their 
fate, then thrust his hand into his pocket, piroutted, eat 
a caper, whistled a tune, and thought no more of it." 

After this, one is not surprised to read of his 
brother, Louis XIII.: 

'< He had studied but little; he took no interest in 
the things that pleased the mind; his pastimes were 
purely animal. He liked to hunt, to work in his garden, 
to net pouches for fish and game, to make snares and 
arquebuses. He liked to make preserves, to lard Meat, 
and to shave. Like his brother, he had one artistie 
quality: he loved music and composed it. 'This waa 
the one smile, the only smile of a natural ingrate.'" 

The translator has done her part acceptably, 
but not with such happiness of effect as to 
make the reader oblivions of her intervention. 
" A document dated posterior [i. e. posteriorly] 
to 1670," is an example of " elegant " English 
that reminds the reviewer of an unlettered 
acquaintance who thought to convey an impres- 
sion of culture by speaking of the centre of the 
day, meaning noon. " Repeated freqnentation 
of the Salon " smacks somewhat of Chester- 
field. " Inenarrable depravity " is rather good, 
though obsolete. " Years gorged with events " 
calls up a picture of old Father Time as a 
glutton — devouring the way before him. " Re- 
criminative dualogues " is self-explanatory. 
The numerous portraits and other illustrations 
add much to the attractiveness of the book.

The Pleasures oe the Table.* 



Here is a noble " Yule-gift," a book truly 
fit for the season ; a book beautiful to behold, 
and which fairly smells of Christmas, — of 
burnt brandy and holly and bays ; a book which 
goes out into the world singing cheerfully and 
lustily : 

" The Boar's Head in hand bring I 
With garlands gay and Rosemary. 
I pray you all sing merrily 

Qui estis in convivio." 

And in very truth the book bears a Boar's 
Head upon its cover. It tells, too, of daintier 
fare, as these chapter-titles bear witness : 

Cookery among the Ancients — With LucuIIas and 
Apicius — The Renaissance of Cookery — Old English 
Dishes — L 'Almanach des Gourmands — A German 
Speisekarte — The School of Savarin — From Careme 
to Dumas — The Cook's Confrere — American vs. En- 
glish Cookery — At Table with the Clergy — Sundry 
Guides to Good Cheer — On Sauces — The Spoils of 

the Cover — Two Esculents Par Excellence Sallets 

and Salads — Sweets to the Sweet. 

It needed good knowledge of cookery and 
literature even to frame such a list of chapter- 
headings; and a ready wit and cunning hand to 
make them speak to us so temptingly " be- 
tween the lines." 

The full title of Mr. Ellwanger's book reads 
as follows : " The Pleasures of the Table : An 
Account of Gastronomy from Ancient Days to 
Present Times. With a History of Its Litera- 
ture, Schools, and Most Distinguished Artists ; 
together with Some Special Recipes and Views 
concerning the Esthetics of Dinners and 
Dinner-Giving." If every book-review could 
quote such a succinct and true epitome of the 
contents of a volume, as is this, and add such 
a list of vivid chapter-titles, we might secure in 
a few lines an exact knowledge of the book 
under consideration, and thus be spared the 
verbose platitudes of so many of our reviewers. 
This book, however, deserves more than a 
presentation of its attractive title-page and 
chapter-headings, for it is an unusual and al- 
together novel book. No previous work has 
thoroughly covered the important art in ques- 
tion, — an art so closely connected not only 
with the pleasure but the welfare and hygiene 
of mankind. 

We have had innumerable treatises on prac- 
tical cookery and gastronomy. Mr. Ellwanger 
gives a Bibliography of such, in which, it may

tronomy from Ancient Days to Present Times. By George H.

be noted, works by women predominate in the 
English language, while in France men seem 
to have furnished the literature as they have 
developed the art of cooking. In the present 
book the history and aesthetics of the table pre- 
dominate over the utilitarian side. An occa- 
sional rare recipe is given, however; and in 
treating of the hygiene of the table some per- 
nicious customs are dealt with in plain speech. 
A sense of gratified appreciation fills me as 
I read the sparkling chapter upon " The Cook's 
Confrere," — something of the mingled feeling 
of gratified pride and satisfied justice which we 
have upon hearing tardy praise given a worthy 
friend who has through some misapprehension 
or mistake been for a time under a cloud. 
For " The Cook's Confrere " is he who was 
chosen by ancient Rome and by King Richard 
III. of England as a badge and cognizance, 
and by St. Anthony as his patron, — the Hog, 
an entity of inestimable benefit to mankind 
and to cooks. Hindus, Mohammedans, Bud- 
dhists, and Israelites to-day regard the Hog 
as what ancient writers termed "rascal." And 
what must be their cuisine? It has well 
been said that were his lardship, the onion 
tribe, and that priceless herb parseley removed 
from us, gastronomy would become obsolete 
and would hopelessly cease to exist. Without 
lard, ham, bacon, sausages, spare rib, souse, 
head cheese, or chine, how empty would be our 
larder ! And vanished too would be our pates, 
our larded filets and game. This chapter on 
the Hog is a fit companion to Charles Lamb's 
famous essay on Roast Pig ; and a prize of 
great delight is offered to the reader in the 
account of a copy of Lamb's works which Mr. 
Ellwanger bought in Paris, bearing the initials 
of Lamb, and annotated in Lamb's own hand- 
writing, and having two additional pages writ- 
ten into the dissertation on Roast Pig. 

One minor statement of Mr. Ellwanger's I 
am going to question, though it is of no gas- 
tronomic importance. He gives the year 1774 
as that of the invention or discovery of a much- 
loved dish — ice cream. It is said that a French 
chef in the employ of the Due de Chartres set 
a dish of ice cream before his master upon a 
hot day in that year. I cannot believe that 
the French — the leaders in culinary arts — 
could have been so slow in learning of that 
delicacy ; for in the journal of William Black 
(a gay young spark who was Secretary of the 
Commissioners appointed by Governor Gooch 
of Virginia to treat with the Iroquois) is the 
following entry under the year 1744 : 



1902.]

"Annapolis, Satnidar, May 19, . . . After which 
came a Dessert no less Curious: Among the Rarities of 
which it was Compos'd, was some fine Ice Cream which, 
with the Strawberries and Milk, eat most Delieiously." 

The illnstrations scattered throughout Mr. 
Ellwanger's pages are unusually charming, and 
form a valuable collection of pictures on culi- 
nary, gastronomic, and sporting subjects. All 
of the originals are rare, and some are unique. 
Among the most pleasing may be mentioned 
the beautiful Flemish interior entitled '• A Sa 
Toute-Puissance I " from a painting by Gabriel 
Metzu, 1664 : a spirited etching, by Birket- 
Foster, of a splendid flock of geese, " The Bird 
of St. Michael " ; the " Promenade Nutritive," 
with its curious antique choking utensils : 
Kleins unctuous monk in his " Non in Solo 
Pane Vivit Homo " ; Masquelier's " Supper in 
the Eighteenth C«ntury " ; and the three sen- 
suous woman diners in '"Apies Bon \ in," from 
the engraving by Eisen in the 1762 edition of 
" Contes et Nouvelles." Of course the chapter 
on " The Spoils of the Cover " gave opportunity 
for the inclusion of such fine sporting prints 
as Cooper's " First of September," Snow's 
"First Catch Tour Hare," one from the 
painting by Stubbs (1768) of "The Spanish 
Pointer,'" and Howitt's "Partridge Shooting" 
(1807). The chapter on truffles and mush- 
rooms has Vayson's realistic picture, " Truffle- 
hunting in the Dauphice." 

I turned the last of the four hundred and 
fifty pages of Mr. Ellwanger's book with un- 
usual sentiments in my brain. Perhaps no 
other book ever roused in me not precisely an 
envy of the author — of his having writt«n the 
book, nor of the good fame and name which 
will come to him through it ; but, rather, a dis- 
tinct envy of the qualifications, the traits, the 
experience, the learning, which had made him 
capable of writing it. I can see what it all 
means, what it proves. To elucidate this special 
subject in the manner which he has, called for 
special qualities : some of these were natural 
gifts, others were acquired by association and 
by education. The writer must know the his- 
tory and literature of many lands — of all civi- 
lized lands. This knowledge he could acquire 
only by careful study, liberal education, and 
ample means, since be must have above all a 
well-selected French library, a special library 
not found in public collections, and he must 
be distinctly a good French scholar. He must 
have travelled widely, and have a discerning 
mind, and an excellent memory. He must 
have a fine and critical palate, must know well 



his wines so as to tell of them separately and 
to make them accord with their complementary 
dishes ; thus once more is indicated the neces- 
sity for financial ease and welfare. He most 
be a botanbt and agriculturist, to know of 
fruit and flower in field and garden ; and he 
mast be a Qover-lover, else the book had lost 
many of its daintiest touches, much of its deli- 
cate charm. And with all this must be combined 
the power to place his natural gifts and acquired 
knowledge gracefully, fluently, and forcibly in 
print. Incidentally, the writer should know 
more than a smattering of hygiene, medicine, 
and chemistry, and be able to point out the 
digestive sequents of various articles of diet ; 
he should have good health himself that his 
sense of taste and smell should be unimpaired. 
He should know of art, of the great pictures 
of the Dutch and Flemish schools ; should be 
a sportsman, to tell of game-food in fur and 
feathers, and a disciple of Isaak Walton. 
I think he mnst be a bit of a oook himself, 
and I am sure he must be a man — no woman 
could have written the book.

Ax Epic of American Exploratiox.* 

Two events of more than ordinary import- 
ance opened up the nineteenth century for the 
young republic of the United States : two that 
are but as one in their common relation to the 
same imperial domain, and yet each in itself 
a transaction so great that it well merits the 
separate interest which it always excites. These 
events were the acquisition by President Jeffer- 
son of the territory known as the Louisiana 
Purchase, and the exploration of that territory 
and its western neighbor by Lewis and Clark. 
Appropriately, each of these two episodes is 
to be separately commemorated by centennial 
ceremonies in the early years of the present 
century, — the purchase of the Louisiana Terri- 
tory at its eastern margin on the Mississippi 
River, and the Expedition of Lewis and Clark 
at the farthest limit attained by them on the 
shores of the Pacific Ocean. 

Each of these episodes afforded a signal illus-

[Dec. 16, 



tratiun of American enterprise, and in each 
the foremost factor was the vigorous and zeal- 
ous personality of the alert President, Thomas 
Jefferson. It was he who selected and sent to 
France the ministers who effected the pur- 
chase, and it was he whose flaming imagination 
had long before suggested the western explor- 
ation as both desirable and feasible. Leader 
in diplomacy and statesmanship, and pioneer in 
advancing scientific discovery, — these were but 
two of the phases of character of the " many- 
sided Jefferson," who was at once framer of 
the Declaration, advocate of religious free- 
dom, promoter of State education, organizer 
of Territorial Government, constitutional law- 
yer, inventive agriculturist, and disciple of 
music and the fine arts. Yet it was less the 
diversity of his intellectual pursuits than it 
was the excellence of his attainments in so 
many fields that won him distinction. 

One gains new views of the quality of Jef- 
ferson's leadership in studying concurrently 
his methods and processes in these two phases 
■of western development. It has become fash- 
ionable to decry his slowness in rising to the 
great opportunity of acquiring at once the 
whole of the Louisiana Territory. But it 
should be remembered that Jefferson's doubts 
■were constitutional scruples, and they did not 
convict him of feebleness ; for a mere weakling 
could not have risen to the height of conscien- 
tious misgiving on the subject. It should be 
remembered, too, that Jefferson took the lead 
in voicing the demand for free navigation of 
the Mississippi, and that not even his ministers 
at the French court had suspected the willing- 
ness of the First Consul to sell all the French 
possessions. It was Napoleon Bonaparte alone 
who was the great originator of the scheme 
for the transfer of the Louisiana Territory ; 
and there was no American who could have 
foreseen the rapidity with which events would 
press forward when prompted by the necessities 
of Napoleon's plans. But that Jefferson was 
no dullard among his progressive countrymen 
is shown by his early advocacy of the scheme 
of trans-continental exploration. Before the 
most sanguine could have hoped for any early 
acquisitions of territory west of the Mississippi, 
even before Gray's discovery of the Columbia 
River, Jefferson had, as early as 1783, broached 
the idea of such an exploration to Colonel 
George Rogers Clark, and had asked him, 
" How would you like to lead such a party ? " 
In 1786 and 1788, he had twice proposed the 
project definitely to John Ledyard, and Led- 



yard had once undertaken such an expedition. 
At about the time when Gray was discovering 
the Columbia, Jefferson was again airing his 
design, and this time it was planned to pursue 
the route of the Missouri River, with Meri- 
wether Lewis in charge. So it was merely the 
realization of his twenty years' dreams of west- 
tern exploration, when it fell to the lot of 
Jefferson, in 1803, to exercise authority on the 
subject, and to become the director of the actual 
journeys of Lewis and Clark. His intense 
desire for the success of the project was mani- 
fest when he addressed Congress confidentially 
on the subject, on January 18, 1803, suggest- 
ing that the real design be masked under an 
act appropriating money "for extending the 
external commerce of the United States." His 
ascendancy was exemplified in the celerity with 
which Congress, within six weeks, acquiesced 
literally in what Jefferson had proposed. All 
this was before even Napoleon had become 
ready to abandon the French claims on this 
continent. Even if Jefferson were among the 
latest to realize that Louisiana was actually ours, 
his perspicacity and inventiveness had already 
prepared the nation to receive and to develop 
the magnificent domain which was to drop into 
America's lap when the Napoleonic earthquake 
should shake the world. 

It ought not to be urged as a reproach, as 
has been done, that this grand exploration in 
behalf of scientific knowledge was projected as 
a commercial venture. That such was the fact 
is only one of the palpable evidences that the 
Americans are preeminently a commercial 
people. This national proclivity has more than 
once given tone to our political affairs. Com- 
mercial differences were at the bottom of the 
contest between the thirteen colonies and the 
mother-country ; and it was largely the neces- 
sities of trade that united the colonies in their 
resistance to Britain. So, again, the movement 
toward the constitution of 1787 originated in a 
commercial convention at Annapolis. An in- 
timate connection between politics and traffic 
is quite normal in a great industrial state. The 
sagacity of Jefferson used the passion for trade 
as the readiest means of increasing the national 
stock of knowledge of our geography, natural 
history, ethnography, and general resources. 

The versatility of Jefferson was manifest 
in the instructions which he gave to this ex- 
pedition for the extension of trade, on the eve 
of its departure. Minute and wide-reaching, 
these instructions added to the duty of explor- 
ation that of making and preserving ample

notes of the observations of the party as to lati- 
tude, longitude, and the courses of streams, 
and the topography, soil, climatic conditions, 
weather phases, vegetable and mineral produc- 
tions, and animal life, of the country traversed ; 
the extent of trade conducted between the na- 
tive inhabitants and their Canadian and other 
neighbors ; and the possible conditions of the 
fur traffic both in the interior and on the Pa- 
cific coast, and the best means to promote the 
same. To the recital of these duties were added 
prudent suggestions looking toward the main- 
tenance of pacific relations with the tribes en- 
countered, and for precautions to be taken to 
assure the return of the party from the Pacific, 
and also directions for frequent reports to the 
seat of government. Nor did the provident 
President fail to arrange for the undisputed 
Boooession of the leadership of the expedition 
in ease of emergencies. Reading to-day the 
minutiae of this chart for a wilderness journey, 
and noting how it anticipated the daily neces- 
sities of the travellers, a stranger might think 
that Jefferson was himself a hardy explorer 
whose wise precepts were the fruit of long ex- 
perience in wood-craft. 

The inspiration of these ample instructions 
was not lost up>ou the ardent pupils of Jef- 
ferson who led forth his expedition across the 
anknown continent. The fulness, minuteness, 
and fidelity of their reports of their travels 
are now, after the lapse of a century, as they 
have ever been, the admiration of all who read 
them. Theirs was the most extensive explora- 
tion upon the continent, and their account of it 
remains the greatest book extant of western 
continental travel. Dr. Elliott Cones well 
styled it '' Our National Epic of Exploration." 
It was the worthy forerunner of a long line of 
American literature of travel and exploration. 

When the History of the Expedition ap- 
peared in print, its charm speedily overran the 
borders of our own land, and it was hailed with 
foreign as well as domestic approbation. The 
daring Americans, says Mr. Richard Walsh, 
had " disclosed a new world to the gaze of phil- 
osophy and the march of civilization." The 
Scotch and the English reviewers frankly 
admitted that " this expedition does great 
credit, both to the government by which it was 
planned, and to the persons by whom it was 
executed," and that the leaders had " per- 
formed, with equal ability, perseverance, and 
saccesB, one of the most arduous journeys that 
ever was accomplished." The first authentic 
edition of the Travels, — that of 1814, pre- 



pared under the direction of Nicholas Biddle, 
with the cooperation of Captain Clark, after 
the untimely death of Captain Lewis, — was 
immediately republished in London, and was 
within two years translated into and published 
in the German and Dutch languages. Before 
1814, the journal kept by Gass, a member of 
the exploring party, had been printed in sev- 
eral editions : and from this and other sources, 
partial accounts of the Expedition and its work 
had been prepared and published, so that eleven 
editions in English and one in French had ap- 
peared, all of them fragmentary and none par- 
ticipated in by the leaders of the expedition. 
Reprints of the authentic version of 1814, in 
English, were issued in Great Britain and 
America in 1815, 1817, and 1893, the last 
named in four volumes, edited and copiously 
annotated by Dr. Elliott Cones : and the 
abridged version published by Messrs. Harper 
& Brothers has appeared in twenty successive 
issues, limited in number, during a series of 
years. So nearly continuous, and so well-nigh 
perennial, has been the desire to read and re- 
read this story of adventurous travel. Yet all 
these issues of the authentic narrative were but 
recently out of print, inaccessible to the gen- 
eral public, and to be found only on the shelves 
of favored libraries. 

The recent revival of interest in centennial 
history has created a demand for the republi- 
cation of this " epic of exploration." One new 
issue has preceded the Chicago edition here 
chronicled ; and the early presentation has been 
announced of a full copy of the original notes 
of the explorers, from which the Biddle edition 
was compiled. But among all these responses 
to the general desire, the Chicago edition pub- 
lished by Messrs. A. C. Clnrg & Co. will easily 
hold high place. It is a faithful reproduction 
of the Biddle edition of 1814. Its clear and 
distinct letter-press and tasteful binding, both 
so pleasing to the eye, will be welcomed by 
readers who are so fortunate as to peruse it» 
and those to whom the Travels are not new will 
delight to greet their old acquaintance in so 
elegant a dress. Dr. James K. Hosmer, whose 
lucid historical style abundantly recommended 
him for the assignment as editor of this re- 
issue, contributes to it a graceful introduction, 
in which the large import of that expedition, 
its high place in the development of the Great 
West, the skill with which it was managed, its 
pacific effect upon the suspicious and uneasy 
tribes, and the vast results flowing from it, 
are tersely yet felicitously summed up. Here

again, as in other o£ his historical writings, 
Dr. Hosmer has emphasized the imperious will 
of the future Emperor of France as the dom- 
inant element in the transfer of Louisiana. 
Lewis and Clark are happily idealized as 
" the Dioscuri of American tradition," whose 
achievements have made real to the present age 
the fabled exploits of Castor and Pollux, the 
stalwart champions of Greek mythology. The 
publishers are to be congratulated on their 
choice of an editor for the Chicago edition of 
this "national epic," no less than upon its 
praiseworthy typography. 

The stirring and strenuous life of the west- 
ern frontier, as that frontier was aligned before 
the great expedition, and also as it has since 
been advanced, teemed with romantic experi- 
ences; and the renewed recital of the events 
of that early period naturally arouses the imag- 
ination of lovers of the marvellous. Our na- 
tional literature already exhibits a centennial 
phase in the abundance of recent historical 
romances. In this class may be mentioned, 
for convenience, one entitled "The Conquest: 
the True Story of Lewis and Clark," — though 
it is not easy to class this book as either a his- 
tory or a romance. Its narrative embraces the 
entire period of the life of William Clark, who 
was four years older than Meriwether Lewis 
and survived him many years ; and it covers 
the years of the wonderful activity of Clark's 
older brother, General George Kogers Clark. 
In chronological sequence, the author has set 
forth all the leading incidents of the romantic 
lives of these stalwart pioneers and of some of 
their spirited contemporaries, and has gar- 
nished her story with much that is apparently 
only traditional. The startling surprises of 
the journey across the continent appear in all 
their novelty ; and the exciting narrative wears 
the garb of fiction, though occasional state- 
ments of familiar history, and transcripts of 
letters from members of the exploring party, 
give to romance an air of verisimilitude. The 
author's title, " The Conquest," implies more 
than the mere expedition ; it is " the Winning 
of the West " that has awakened her fancy, 
and that she has sought to narrate in heroic 
form. Her unique version of the "epic of 
exploration " will fascinate many readers, and 
will doubtless induce in many others a more 
appreciative interest in and a more sympathetic 
understanding of the intrepid men who actively 
promoted the expansion of our national domain.

An Old and a New Estimate of 
Thoreau.* 

An edition de luxe of " Walden," a reprint 
of William EUery Channing's " Thoreau, the 
Poet-Naturalist " edited by another friend and 
biographer of Thoreau, Mr. F. B. Sanborn, and 
a new life by Mrs. Annie Russell Marble, all 
issued within a few months, point unmistak- 
ably to a gratifying awakening of interest in 
Thoreau and his philosophy of life. From the 
nature of his message this is only to be ex- 
pected. The strange thing is that, with all the 
latter-day emphasis upon nature-study, the her- 
mit of Walden should not sooner have come to 
his own. It has been said that every American 
newsboy knows his Emerson, but the phase of 
Transcendentalism represented by Thoreau has 
never been in the air. And today, after forty 

years, his two-fold panacea for social ills 

solitude and simplification — is but beginning 
to be received as a fresh and timely revelation 
by an over-burdened world. This neglect has 
been due of course to the sharp edges of the 
man. An eccentric, an egotist, sentimental 
over Nature, cynical towards his fellow-men, — 
the popular idea of Thoreau has been that of 
Lowell's brilliant but unsympathetic essay, 
which sets forth that most insinuating of fal- 
lacies, a dramatic half-truth. 

It is the one point of likeness between Chan- 
ning's and Mrs. Marble's biographies that 
they combat Lowell's position, both painting 
Thoreau as thoroughly human and natural 
in spite of his oddities. To Channing the time 
passed at Walden was the merest episode ; he 
barely mentions it. He is writing of his most 
intimate friend, with whom he talked and 
walked, and whose poetic appreciation of Na- 
ture he so enjoyed. It does not occur to him 
that any man of sense should think Thoreau 
abnormal. " Walden," he says somewhere, 
" increased Thoreau's repute as a writer, if 
some great men thought him bean-dieted, with 
an owl for his minister, and who milked crea- 
tion, not the cow. It is in vain for the angels 
to contend against stupidity." And he turns 
serenely to his next point. Mrs. Marble's de- 
fence of Thoreau is conscious. It is indeed her 
main contention that his Quixotism has been

over-emphasized, her chief aim to translate his 
apparent antagonism to society into an earnest 
effort to meet its vital problems. 

Except for this one point in common, the 
methods of the two biographers are as the poles 
apart. Channing did his work before 1873, 
when biography had not yet become a fashion, 
nor the making of it an exact science ; he was 
therefore not hedged in by precedent as he 
might be today. But furthermore he was a 
genius, — without being like that other genius, 
Boswell, a fool. His work is erratic, irregular, 
rambling, often obscure, marked by curious 
omissions and constant repetition, rich with 
recondite allusions and interesting citations. 
It is necessary to wade in deep if you would 
find Thoreau, but you are paid double for your 
effort. You find Channing also. And if his 
work displays the eccentricities of genius, it 
does not stop with the merits of mediocrity ; it 
presents Thoreau with a vividness, an intimacy, 
a completeness, equalled only by the few master 
biographies. 

It is needless to say that Mr. Sanborn has 
performed his difficult editorial duties with rare 
tact and discretion. He knew Thoreau well, 
and Channing better. He has been familiar 
with this work on " The Poet-Naturalist " for 
almost forty years, having read the draft of 
1863 and published it in part in his newspaper, 
" The Boston Commonwealth," and seen the 
1878 version (now out of print) through the 
press. The present edition is based upon a 
copy marked with Channing's revisions and 
annotations. In the interest of clearness a few 
insertions from the original sketch of 1863 
have been made. There are some new pas- 
sages from Thoreau's unpublished journals and 
papers, and a few additions to the " Memorial 
Verses " at the end of the biography. In the 
" Walks and Talks " of Thoreau, Emerson, and 
Channing, the names of the interlocutors, omit- 
ted by Channing, have been supplied, and there 
is an occasional change of order. An excel- 
lent index systematizes the book and makes it 
available for reference. But the alterations 
are superficial ; in its new edition the work is 
still Channing's. It is his portrait that Mr. 
Sanborn has chosen for the etched frontispiece 
of the volume, and he has refrained from omit- 
ting any of the " Memorial Verses," though 
their connection with Thoreau seems slight, 
because " the connection existed in his [Chan- 
ning's] enduring memory and his tender heart, 
and among them are some of his best lines." 

When brought into contrast with Channing's 



unmeasured " feast of reason and flow of soul," 
Mrs. Marble's book is noticeably methodical. 
If he is wilfully obscure and enigmatical, she 
is almost painfully anxious to secure proper 
proportion and to make herself understood. 
That is, she has aimed to write a popular and 
at the same time an unbiassed study of Thoreau. 
To this end she has made use of Channing's, 
Sanborn's, and Mr. Salt's biographies, as well 
as of Thoreau's letters and diaries (some still 
unpublished), and she has interviewed the few 
surviving friends of Thoreau and his sister 
Sophia. She has studied her subject conscien- 
tiously and thoroughly, and has made good use 
of her ample materials. 

Mrs. Marble has not tried to paint a striking, 
dramatic picture. Thoreau's reputation, she 
thinks, has already been dragged at the tail of 
too many epigrams. Instead, she wishes to tell 
the whole story, omitting nothing in the way 
of inherited temperament, early training, or 
environment, that will serve to account for the 
man's seeming inconsistencies. The " Walden 
Experiment" — she uses Thoreau's own phrase 
for it — is perhaps the crisis of her book, but 
she shows that it was not the experiment of a 
hermit, nor yet of a misanthrope, that its motive 
was neither laziness, selfishness, nor a desire 
for notoriety ; and that independence of society 
formed no part of the plan. These popular 
misconceptions she refutes with Thoreau's own 
words and the testimony of his friends, and 
she makes out an excellent case. The gist of 
the argument is that Thoreau was both " sylvan 
and human," as Alcott aptly put it, that his 
complex nature asked correspondingly much 
of life, and that he went to Walden because he 
preferred beans and leisure for poetry and Na- 
ture study to drudging days spent in catering 
to the " bugbear maintenance." St. Francis 
taught his followers that the guide-posts on the 
royal road to freedom of the spirit read, " Have 
no riches." " Have no wants and you are 
free," amended Thoreau. But he did not make 
a programme nor gather a party. He applied 
his theory, but it was the theory and not the 
specific application that he valued. So it is 
a mistake to suppose that to be a disciple of 
Thoreau one must seek out a Walden and 
plant a bean field. Thoreau spent two years 
in his " wooden ink-stand," but he lived his 
philosophy to the last day of his life. 

Mrs. Marble's interest in Thoreau's theory 
of living does not make her oblivious to his 
work as a naturalist and a writer. In this last 
connection she insists that his so-called imita- 



466

tion of Emerson was merely the result of sim- 
ilar surroundings and interests, and that he 
was as far as possible from being a parasite of 
Emerson or any other man. Indeed his ultra- 
individualism is at once his most distinctive 
trait and his worst failing. So Mrs. Marble 
is not a mere apologist. She freely admits the 
rough edges, but she pleads for the integrity 
and consistency of the man. On the whole 
her impression of Thoreau seems well rounded, 
impartial, and sympathetic ; one which should 
enlarge the circle of his influence. 

Both books are handsomely bound and well 
printed. Besides the ordinary edition of the 
Channing reprint there is a limited edition on 
hand-made paper, with five additional full-page 
etchings. Mrs. Marble's work contains eleven 
beautiful photogravure illustrations.

Webstkk in his Public Life.* 



In his latest book Professor McMaster has 
re-written the public life of Webster from the 
sources, and has given the reading public per- 
haps the best account of the development and 
the effective influence upon the nation's history 
of our greatest orator and one of our greatest 
statesmen. Such of the chapters as were pub- 
lished in the " Century Magazine " proved to 
be interesting ; but it is only as they are gath- 
ered together in a volume that we see the 
strength and skill of the author's work. 

Comparing the book not only with Curtis's 
full biography, but with Lodge's volume in the 
" American Statesmen " series, or even with 
Congressman McCall's fine oration of last 
year, one misses much that he would expect 
and wish to find in such a biography. Al- 
though there is a somewhat full account of 
Webster's early life, and of the environment 
that gave shape to his character and develop- 
ment, the account of his mature years presents 
only his public life to us. There is nothing of 
the personal side : we are told that he made a 
fine income as a lawyer ; we learn incidentally 
that he was married and had children, and a 
picture of his second wife leads us to infer a 
second marriage. There is nothing about his 
social life, nothing about his personal habits 
and characteristics, his intense love of nature, 
his Marshfield home, and his home life. Of his

last days the author disposes in ten lines. It 
is not Webster the man, but Webster the great 
figure in American history, that interests Pro- 
fessor McMaster. Nor does our author give 
us much of his own opinions about Webster 
and his various achievements. There is no dis- 
cussion of him as an orator, or as a lawyer, or 
even as a statesman : for these matters we must 
go to the books of McCall and Lodge and 
Curtis. We are taken, as it were, to see Web- 
ster in the important acts and moments of his- 
life ; and these are left to tell us of the man> 
Even of such events, some are almost un- 
mentioned : the Dartmouth College Case, that 
made Webster's reputation as a lawyer, ha» 
one line ; the Plymouth oration, another line ; 
and his service in the Massachusetts Conven- 
tion, less than a page. But we have forty- 
five pages, or one-seventh of the book, given 
to the encounter with Hayne as the climax of 
Webster's career, — though even here there is 
little of enthusiastic description of the dram- 
atic scenes, but rather a setting forth of main 
points made by the contestants and of the sig- 
nificance of the contest in the great struggle 
between the North and South. Of the great 
orations, that at Bunker Hill is most fully de- 
scribed, and that on the Greek Revolution re- 
ceives due attention. With proper gratitude 
for what the author has given us, the reader 
cannot help wishing that he had seen fit to give 
more. 

One naturally turns to the Seventh of 
March speech as a test of an author's treat- 
ment of Webster ; and Professor McMaster's 
final chapter containing his discussion of this 
most famous of all his speeches is interesting 
and valuable. We quote a few sentences. 

" The purpose of Webster was not to put slavery in- 
nor shut it out of the new Territories, nor make every 
man in the North a slave-catcher, nor bid for Southern 
support in the coming election. He sought a final and 
lasting settlement of a question which threatened the 
permanence of the Union and the Constitution, and' 
Clay's ' comprehensive scheme of adjustment,' he be- 
lieved, would effect the settlement. The abolition, 
the anti-slavery, the Free-soil parties, were to him but 
' Northern movements ' that would ' come to nothing. ' 
The great debate of 1850 he regarded as idle talk that 
interrupted consideration of the tariff. Never, in 
his opinion, had history made record of such mischief 
arising from angry debates and disputes, both in the 
government and iu the country, on questions of so very 
little real importance. Therein lay his fatal mistake. 
The great statesman had fallen behind the times, and' 
it was perhaps well for him that he was now removed' 
from the Senate to the Department of State. . . . 
Change of place, however, brought no change of views, 
and his hatred of the Free-soilers and the abolitionists 
grew stronger and stronger. To him these men were

a band of sectionalists, narrow of mind, wanting in 
patriotism, without a spark of national feeling, and 
qaite ready to see the Union go to pieces if their own 
selfish ends were gained. Free-soilers and abolitionists 
were all one to him, and as such were attacked in lan- 
gnage unworthy of the great man." 

Webster had indeed fallen behind the times, 
had parted company with the constituency that 
had always idolized him, and had brought upon 
himself criticism and denunciation which em- 
bittered the remainder of his life. From the 
beginning, his passion had been for the Con- 
stitution and the Union. He could see the 
forces that were working to undermine this 
Union, but he had not the moral insight that 
oould discern the new forces and the new issues 
that were to displace those that had filled his 
life. His motives were fiercely attacked ; he 
was called traitor, slave-catcher ; he was ac- 
cused of giving up his life-long convictions to 
secure Southern support for the presidency ; 
he was compared with Benedict Arnold by 
those who had been his ardent supporters. 
But we are far enough away now to see that 
his motives were pure and his statesmanship 
was sound in many of his positions ; but he 
could not discern the signs of the times. 

The book is beautifully printed, is adorned 
with twenty-three excellent portraits in addi- 
tion to other illustrations, and contains a full 
index. Charles H. Cooper.

joamals. The author's journey from Peking 
lay through Shansi and Shensi along the route 
of the retreat of the Dowager Empress Tsz' Hi 
and her court when distasteful foreigners were 
in the Imperial City. Mr. Nichols entered 
China as the representative of the " Christian 
Herald," in the interests of the distribution of 
the famine fund raised in this country for suf- 
ferers in Shensi. He travelled with official 
escort, and with the card of Prince Ching, 
head of the foreign office. This proved to be 
an '' open sesame " to the best that the man- 
darin could command, and brought immediate 
solution of all difficulties. As a guest at official 
inns, he drank the tea which the Emperor 
liked, and became accustomed to being gravely 
reminded by the banchaiti that the pile of 
bricks on which he slept was the same bed on 
which the Son of Heaven had passed the night. 
The book is especially opportune because of 
the light which it throws upon the retreat of 
the Court and other recent events of Chinese 
history. The unique facilities which the author 
enjoyed brought him into close contact with 
Chinese officialdom, the source of many of the 
incidents related. In Chinese eyes, this retreat 
was a triumphal progress, a leisurely tour of 
inspection, followed by a return in state after 
the dispersal of the barbarians who had invaded 
the capitol before the invincible Chinese. The 
route of the royal party was still marked by 
repaired roads and bridges, by fresh paint and 
gilding on idols and temples, and by unwonted 
order and cleanliness in the Kung Kwans, or 
official inns. The dominating personality as 
well as the barbarous punishments of the Em- 
press Dowager were everywhere apparent. 
She forcibly suppressed all sympathy with the 
Boxer movement, and decapitated corrupt offi- 
cials or unsatisfactory cooks with equal ruth- 
lessness. The common people were everywhere 
loyal to the Empress, and had unbounded con- 
fidence in her ability and desire to maintain 
" Peace." 

" Nearly all the stories that were told to me to illds- 
trate the trne greatness of the Empress Dowager con- 
cloded with the words 'and bis head was cnt off.' 
Aeeonnts of the imperial progress through Shansi and 
Sbensi, as related by mandarins and banchaitis, strongly 
resemble the experiences of ' Alice ' with the ' Wonder- 
land ' queen." 

The degradation of Ta-a-Ko, son of Prince 
Tuan and heir-apparent, was not a political 
move nor occasioned by the banishment of his 
father, but resulted from the pranks by which 
this Manchu Don Juan sought to enliven the 
dull capitol Sian.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



" Ta-a-Ko was such a good fellow and his wanting to 
have a good time was such a rare Chinese fault that 
these characteristics might have proved an antidote to 
hereditary narrowness and fanaticism. One can hardly 
help regretting that he will never sit cross-legged on 
the throne of the black-haired people." 

Mr. Nichols visited the ruins near Sian which 
contain the disputed Nestorian tablet which 
records in Chinese and Syriac the introduction 
of Christianity into China in the seventh cen- 
tury. Photographs of the inscriptions are repro- 
duced, including some not heretofore recorded. 
The author regards the evidence for the authen- 
ticity of the tablet as conclusive. Neither 
military nor missionary spirit breathes in these 
pages. It is an unimpassioned record of the 
author's observations, and Chinese problems 
are mostly untouched ; however, the blight of 
the land, the opium curse, does rouse him to 
expressions of indignation at England's course 
in forcing the trade upon China, and at the 
falsifications of the Royal Commission of 1893 
which condones the iniquity. In his preface, 
the author acknowledges that he fell somewhat 
under the spell of the Shensi point of view. 
His veneration of ancient and antique methods 
reaches such a point at times that it warps his 
comparisons of policies in this " gray land of 
dim beginnings and of upstart barbarian na- 
tions." A single instance will suffice to show 
the method and spirit of these contrasts. A 
few taels had been stolen from his caravan by 
one of his carters, who under torture confessed 
to the mandarin that he had spent the money. 
Whereupon the mandarin insisted that Mr. 
Nichols accept reimbursement from his private 
purse. In comment the author remarks : " I 
have heard of Mott Street Chinamen being 
held up and robbed by ' toughs ' on the Bowery, 
and I believe that some of the thieves have 
been punished ; but I have yet to learn of one 
such case in which a police-captain refunded to 
the complainant the amount of his loss." Ob- 
viously there is little basis for comparison of 
the aforesaid laundryman and the famine-fund 
envoy travelling on Prince Ching's card ; nor 
is this incident typical of the treatment of 
foreigners by Chinese mandarins. This dis- 
tortion of perspective, combined with the 
brevity and unique conditions of the author's 
acquaintance with China and with his ignor- 
iance of the language, render his judgments of 
Chinese character and customs less discrimin- 
ating than those of others who have written 
from the experiences of many years of intimate 
contact with the race. Still, the book is a val- 
uable contribution to the literature on China. 



For two years Professor Edward S. Morse 
occupied the chair of zoology in the Imperial 
University at Tokyo, and after a residence of 
several years in Japan he made a brief visit to 
Shanghai and Canton, and thus gained a few 
" Glimpses of China and Chinese Homes." 
The notes of his journal, with pen-and-ink 
sketches of Chinese dwellings and interiors, 
especially of kitchens and utensils of house- 
hold economy and industry, were published in 
an American architectural journal. These 
have been expanded into a small book, with the 
help of a wide margin and thirty-five empty 
pages between chapters. The value of the 
work lies in its illustration of articles not usu- 
ally pictured in books on China, and in the 
critical comparisons of things Chinese and 
Japanese. The book is marred by a tinge of 
pessimism even on extraneous subjects. 

An address before the New York Yacht Club 
upon " Cruising in the West Indies " has been 
published in book form by Mr. Anson Phelps 
Stokes, for the use of yachtsmen in these 
waters. It recounts briefly the experiences of 
the " Sea Fox " on a trip from Charleston to 
Port of Spain, and return via the Bahamas. 
Suggestions are made for a sixty and for a 
hundred days' itinerary among the Virgin, 
Windward, and Leeward Islands ; and there 
are notes regarding the Bermudas, Barbados, 
and Bahamas. Reminiscences of yachting and 
sailing experiences, and a few words about 
yachting in Grecian and English waters, the 
latter principally concerned with royalty, are 
added. A brief appendix deals with the polit- 
ical future of these islands of our tropics. A 
good map, a list of books, and blanks for the 
record of a cruise, are inserted. 

Several books have been written about Bor- 
neo and its people, but most of them are con- 
cerned with the externals of the subject, and 
at the most deal only with the coast tribes. Dr. 
William Henry Furness, 3rd, has penetrated 
into the interior among the head-hunting Kay- 
ans and Kenyahs of the Baram district of 
Sarawak. His book, " The Home-life of Bor- 
neo Head-Hunters," as its title indicates, is a 
piece of intensive work confined to a thorough 
and skilful investigation of the life and cus- 
toms of these savage tribes. His several chap- 
ters treat of the home-life, of the ceremonies 
attending the naming of a chief's son, and of 
the early training of a head-hunter, an incident 
in which is the method by which the boys are 
accustomed to the letting of human blood. An

this hardening process. The author also de- 
scribes in detail the omens of the preparations 
for, and the progress of a war expedition, and 
the elaborate ceremonies at the conclusion of 
peace. Their religion requires that a fresh hu- 
man head must be hung on the verandah of the 
village long-house after every calamity, to bring 
again blessing and prosperity to the community. 
The chapter on personal embellishment treats of 
the patterns and method of tatooing, and the cu- 
rious splitting and elongation of the ear-lobes, 
together with other bodily mutilations. The 
signs and customs attending the operation of 
lali, a species of Bornean taboo, are explained, 
and variations in the different tribes are noted. 
These chapters also give a most interesting pic- 
ture of the jungle-life of these simple people, 
of the structure of their homes with their do- 
mestic and industrial equipment, of their rude 
arts, of their culture of rice, preparation of 
tapioca, and collection of camphor and edible 
bird's nests, of their military accoutrements 
and religious symbols. The author also vividly 
portrays the daily life in the villages along the 
river, the work and play, the customs and su- 
perstitions, which attend minutiae of the daily 
routine, as well as those which mark more im- 
portant events, such as a camphor hunt, a fish- 
ing party, a trip to a neighboring tribe, the 
taking of a head, marriage, sickness, death and 
burial. He also gives an insight into the char- 
acter of the people, and the reader comes to 
admire the intelligent Tama Bulan, to distrust 
the crafty Laki La, and to tire of the lugubri- 
ous and voluble Laki Jok Orong. 

" What with browless and lashless eyes, inky teeth, 
brass plugs, looped ears, and blue legs, I am afraid I 
have given but a sorry picture of those whom I would 
fain have my readers regard with as much kindliness as 
my memory now holds for the originals. These freaks 
of fashion are, however, merely external ; underneath 
I found honesty, hospitality, gentleness, and a child-like 
simplicity. The Kayans and Kenyahs harmonise with 
their surroundings. The very word ' jungle ' possesses 
an indefinable charm, — it is full of gay, exuberant life 
in insect and flower ; but in its depths, side by side with 
these, lurks swift death. Deep-seated in the heart of 
the joyous, child-like Borneans, there reigns in their 
bosoms, true to their jungle home, an inextinguishable 
yearning for a bead not their own. Nevertheless, I like 
them." 

The author also comes to understand why 
Rajah Brooke has been so successful in gov- 
erning Sarawak. Running through several 
chapters is a tale of diplomacy in which the 
Resident skilfully uses a tribal feud to admin- 
ister retributive justice, utilizes their belief in 
omens to further peace even while proclaiming 



his own skepticism of their efficacy, satisfies a 
headhunting expedition with an ancient bor- 
rowed skull, and brings a bloodless foray to a 
triumphant Jawa, or peace celebration. We are 
also told of the Punans, who " have never a 
thought of the morrow ; no cares ; no respon- 
sibilities ; no possessions ; no enemies, for they 
desire nothing that other people have, not even 
clothes ; money is dross ; and home is where 
they rest their blow-pipes and hang up their 
parangs." This is a most charming book of 
travel. It reads well, its field is novel, and its 
treatment is most thorough and satisfactory. 
Moreover, there is in it a wholesome human 
element. One notes a slight tendency to repe- 
tition, with too frequent use of the parenthesis ; 
he longs for a map, and wishes so heavy a book 
were better bound. Its charm is greatly height- 
ened by the 89 full-page heliotype plates, well 
executed from photographs which excel in com- 
position and appropriateness. 

In his preface to the book just noted, the 
author states that he omits unimportant details 
as to the height of the thermometer, the dis- 
comforts of food or travel, or the number of 
men who carried his luggage. On the other 
hand, in Mr. George Horton's " In Argolis " 
we find that it is primarily personal experience 
and incident which forms the thread of his 
story. Anything, from the setting up of a stove 
to the christening of the family Babycoula, 
serves to guide his " flitting about in an irrele- 
vant and inconsequential manner." With the 
craft of a bookmaker, he manages incident and 
story to portray the life of shepherds and fish- 
ermen, townsfolk and priest, in the little Greek 
village of Poros, and to mingle with narrative 
myth and history, and not a little poetry and 
fancy, — and all in a humorous, nay, jocular 
style. Mr. Horton was once in our diplomatic 
service in Greece, and his book records the 
experiences of a summer with his family in a 
remote Greek village. It illumines the life of 
the Greeks of to-day. A few illustrations from 
photographs, and an introduction by Professor 
Alexander, formerly United States Minister to 
Greece, lend interest to the volume. 

One might well imagine that an author plan- 
ning to write a book of Italian travel today 
would find it difficult to avoid well-beaten paths 
and to clothe the theme anew with interest and 
novelty. But this is just what Miss Hooker 
has most admirably done in her " Wayfarers in 
Italy." It is an account of the sojournings of 
a small party of ladies in some of the smaller 
cities, towns, and villages of the Lombard plain,

in the Marches and Abruzzi and the heart of 
Umbria. It records a drive through Tuscany, 
and excursions from Rome and along the 
Adriatic, with visits to little-known towered 
cities. One chapter is given to a sojourn in 
Florence with an Italian household, and an- 
other, the best in the book, to a charming 
account of gondola days in Venice. It is typi- 
cal of the work that widely-known places of 
interest are passed by, and the reader is de- 
lighted with new discoveries in byways of city 
and country. St. Marks and the Grand Canal 
are mere landmarks by the wayside, and the 
Campanini is not even mentioned ; but we do 
visit the Madonna of San Giorgis, and make a 
most memorable call at the home of Giovanni, 
our clever gondolier. These were merry way- 
farers, and Italy through their eyes is not only 
beautiful and everywhere interesting but it is 
also a land of good cheer and pleasant folk, — 
so much so, in fact, that one longs for disaster 
or a villain to break the spell. This is a 
charmingly written book, dainty and bright, 
and full of humor and human interest. It also 
contains a deal of information, and might well 
be used as a supplement to Baedeker. The 
whole volume, binding, typography, illustra- 
tions, from title to tail-piece, is in excellent 
keeping with the refinement and good taste of 
the text. 

It is a different Italy that one sees in Mr. 
Ashton Willard's "Land of the Latins," which 
is mainly confined to Home and its environs, 
and, notwithstanding the title, deals more with 
modern Koman society and Italian men and 
women of affairs than it does with Italy or 
Home of to-day. The reader gains some in- 
sight into the personalities of the royal family, 
of Italian actors of note, and of authors in 
several fields of literature. It is the life in 
the palaces, at the theatre, at the races, in 
country homes, at the summer resorts, in the 
studios and bookshops, which the author de- 
scribes in a manner not without interest, but 
lacking somewhat in color and humor. 

A handbook originally prepared for the 
Glasgow International Exhibition by the De- 
partment of Agriculture and Technical Instruc- 
tion for Ireland has been reissued in more 
elaborate form, becoming, in fact, an encyclo- 
paedia of Erin. It sets forth Ireland's chief 
economic resources and industries from lace to 
linen and stone to ships. It is also full of 
information on questions of sociological import 
and more than local interest, such as the eco- 
nomic distribution of the population, the work- 



ings of the cooperative credit associations, and 
the " Congested Districts Board " for the re- 
lief of the peasantry, and especially the exten- 
sive system of agricultural cooperation in a 
great variety of ways, such as the sale of pro- 
duce and the employment of expert instructors. 
The splendid equipment for art instruction in 
Dublin, Belfast, and Cork is described, and ita 
results upon the lace and linen industries and 
the home-crafts carried on in peasants' cottages 
are made apparent. A fully illustrated chap- 
ter on modern Irish lace-making follows the 
process from designing to marketing, with a 
wealth of details that will delight connoisseurs. 
Naturally, the agricultural resources are most 
fully dealt with, from the physical features of 
the land to the various products of the fields 
and pastures ; but the whole question of land- 
tenure, for obvious reasons, is not mentioned.. 
The book is filled with facts from cover to 
cover, and is printed on a special Irish paper 
of excellent quality.

Weighty in both senses of the word is the huge- 
folio upon the painter " Pintoricchio, his Life, Work, 
and Time " (Lippincott), by Dr. Corrado Ricci, 
Director of the Brera at Milan. Indeed one must 
draw up to his library table if he would look this 
book over in comfort. The extra-heavy paper, 
however, makes a splendid printing-surface for the 
numerous superb reproductions of the painter's fres- 
coes, some in color, some in photogravure, besides 
many half-tones, large and small. A number of th& 
most beautiful of these plates depict the frescoes in 
the Borgia rooms of the Vatican. The restoration 
of these famous rooms and their reopening to the 
public in 1897, under the direction of Leo XIII., 
awakened interest in the great decorator and render 
timely this exhaustive study by Dr. Ricci, who has 
aimed to make his work more comprehensive, along 
both critical and biographical lines, than that of any 
previous writer. Pintoricchio is ranked very high 
by Dr. Ricci. While he lacks the depth and pas- 
sion of the three or four greatest Italian masters, 
he clearly stands well up in the second rank by 
virtue of " his quaint and graceful fancy, the richness 
of his accessories and ornament, and his skilful 
distribution of animated groups of figures." Again, 
he is interesting because he occupies so unique a 
position in the Umbrian school, standing between 
the " conventional sweetness " of his master Peru- 
gino and the strongest work of Raphael, who, Dr. 
Ricci thinks, has gotten credit for some of his older 
friend's best designs. Then he lived in the fifteenth

centary, that most princely and profligate period of 
the Italian Renaissance ; and by no means the 
least interesting feature of Dr. Ricci's monograph 
is its attempt at a reconstruction of the environ- 
ment of this protege and friend of the Borgias. All 
the magnificence of the period glows in his splendid 
coloring and in the rich silks and brocades that 
bedeck his figures ; and a real understanding of the 
frescoes implies a knowledge of the sumptuons 
beauty of fifteenth century Italy. As has been said, 
the most novel chapter of the book is that upon the 
Borgia frescoes. Next, both in interest and in 
beauty of illustration, is the treatment of the decor- 
ations for the Siena Library. Here the theory, 
current since Vasari's day, that Pintoricchio was 
indebted to Raphael for his designs, is discussed and 
shown not to be plausible. It is a pity that so 
scholarly and authoritative a work as Dr. Ricci's 
should be published without an index or a complete 
list of the plates it contains. 

In " Social New York under the Georges " 
(Appleton) Miss Esther Singleton writes of the 
city houses and country homes, the furniture, plate, 
and china, the dress, the plays, balls, and dinners of 
the opulent pre-Revolutionary New-Yorker, aiming 
thus to build up a clear picture of the social condi- 
tions in what has sometimes been called "The Golden 
Age of New York." Primitive these conditions cer- 
tainly were not, as Miss Singleton proves from such 
authentic records as old wills, inventories, letters, 
diaries, and newspapers. The documentary tone of 
the book grows a little wearisome before the end, 
unless one has some special interest in the subject ; 
yet from another point of view it is a most valuable 
quality, indicating accuracy and completeness, and 
making the conclusions of real historical value. 
Like Miss Singleton's other study of Colonial days, 
" The Furniture of Our Forefathers," her new book 
is fully illustrated. The pictures show articles of 
furniture, china, plate, and costumes actually owned 
by famous citizens whose descendants have kindly 
allowed them to be photographed. The quaint 
tail-pieces to the chapters are reproductions of adver- 
tisements found in the newspapers of the day. 

" Social Life in the Early Republic " by Miss 
Anne HoUingsworth Wharton treats most fascinat- 
ingly a similar theme. The author passes over the 
characteristic and interesting society of early New 
York, Boston, Philadelphia, and the Southern cities, 
to write of the more typically republican life at the 
new capitol of a new nation. Why this capitol was 
chosen despite the loud protests of the older cities, 
and how it was planned and built in nucleus, forms 
the theme of the earlier chapters. Those were the 
days when " a city of magnificent distances " had 
bitter meaning for the elegant Spanish minister 
whose gilded coach stuck in the mud in its transit 
across the miles of rutted lane that lay between the 
scattered residences ; and when the prayer of the 
French diplomat, " My God I What have I done to 
reside in such a city ? " was doubtless echoed by 
many a patriotic American statesman. But with 



characteristic republican promptness conditions were 
changed, and Washington blossomed into a social 
centre, retaining traces of its distinctive, old-time 
flavor down to the middle of the last century. Miss 
Wharton is steeped in all sorts of Colonial lore, and 
her racy, gossipy narrative is charming from begin- 
ning to end. The publishers (Lippincott) have 
brought out the book in a dainty yellow binding 
and with many excellent pictures. Most of these 
plates are reproductions of famous portraits and 
miniatures of some of the belles and beauties of the 
early republic. 

One of the most profound and elaborate art 
studies of the season is Miss Maud Crnttwell's 
"Lnca and Andrea Delia Robbia and their Suc- 
cessors " (Dutton). Some idea of the book's scope 
may be gained from the fact that, with its various 
appendices, it contains three hundred and fifty 
large octavo pages and includes also no less than 
one hundred and fifty full -page illustrations. 
Again, the monograph embodies the results of 
original research, which shows itself as patient, 
painstaking, and scholarly. And, thirdly, the treat- 
ment, while detailed, is clear, unified, and surpris- 
ingly simple. The biographies of Lnca, Andrea, 
and Giovanni Delia Robbia are pieced together 
from the scant materials at hand; the distinc- 
tive characteristics of the art of each are pointed 
out, and there is a detailed analysis of all their 
important works, followed by an account of the 
productions of the more talented of Giovanni's 
brothers, including the bizarre porcelain palace that 
Girolamo built for the King of France. In the 
appendices are to be fonnd a genealogical tree of 
the Robbia family, complete lists of the works of 
its various members, a bibliography, and a collection 
of documents many of which are here published 
for the first time. The purpose of the author is 
twofold. She wishes first to show that while Luca 
Delia Robbia worked in terra cotta, and indeed 
invented that pretty and popular process in its 
application to sculpture, yet it was in marble and 
bronze that he showed his greatest power. And 
next she urges that Luca, being judged by such 
masterpieces as the Cantoria and the Bronze Doors, 
shall not be made to stand sponsor to the charm- 
ing but inferior work of his nephew Andrea, 
and certainly not for the paltry performances of 
Giovanni and the later school. The connoisseur in 
Renaissance art will be most interested in the col- 
lection of documents, and in Miss Cruttwell's de- 
tailed investigations which aim to extricate from 
the composite terra-cottas of the Robbia family the 
special handiwork of each, as well as to assign entire 
sculptures to their respective artists. But the gen- 
eral reader will find delightful description and clear 
exposition, so unified by being related to a few 
essential points that he can easily follow this inter- 
esting history of the rise and decline of the Robbia 
art. The illustrations, many in photogravure, form 
a notable collection, and the binding of the volume 
is strikingly artistic.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Mr. and Mrs. Edwin H. Blasbfield's well-known 
work on "Italian Cities " (Scribner) is now issued 
in a holiday edition, in two attractive volumes. 
The distinctive feature of the book in its present 
form is the remarkably soft and clear half-tone 
plates, almost equal to photogravures in beauty. 
These reproduce about one hundred masterpieces of 
Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture — gen- 
erally in the last case some beautiful detail rather 
than a less isteresting view of a whole building. 
Ravenna, Siena, Florence, Parma, Perugia, Cor- 
tona, Spoleto, Assisi, Rome, and Mantua are the 
cities considered, — not street by street, but for 
their spirit and atmosphere, and chiefly for their 
art treasures. St. Francis, however, who gave Assisi 
all its fame, is accorded, in the study of that city, 
equal place with Giotto ; and the sketch of Cortona 
is entirely devoted to a visit to the nuns of Santa 
Margherita. 

The fact that " Japanese " has come to be almost 
synonymous with " artistic " probably accounts for 
the other fact, that books about Japan are always 
beautifully bound and copiously illustrated. "Japan 
and her People," by Miss Anna C. Hartshorne, is 
no exception to this rule. It is issued in two vol- 
umes by Messrs. Coates & Co., in their "Photo- 
gravure Series," and its handsome red cloth covers 
are richly decorated with a stork pattern in gold. 
There are fifty excellent photogravures, picturing 
all parts of the land and all phases of the life of its 
people. Miss Hartshorne has lived in Japan for 
several years, has entered into the every-day life of 
all classes of the people, and loves the land and its 
traditions as if they were her own. She takes her 
reader into remote nooks and corners, where the 
customs of "old Japan" still linger undisturbed, 
and shows him how the genuine native lives and 
works and plays and worships. She gives him 
legends and folk-tales in plenty, and history, too, 
enough to make the monuments of to-day intellig- 
ible. She has in mind particularly the tourist, but 
in planning her work with reference to his probable 
itinerary, she merely makes it all the easier for 
the stay-at-home reader to imagine himself in the 
sunny land of the cherry blossom. A copious index, 
so often unfortunately omitted from books of travel, 
makes the material presented available for reference. 

A second volume in the " Photogravure Series " 
(Coates), similarly illustrated, indexed, bound, and 
boxed, is "Vienna and the Viennese" by Maria 
Hornor Lansdale. Miss Lansdale bases her work 
upon Victor Tissot's, which she has considerably 
expanded and altered to bring it up to date. In 
writing of the gayest capital in Europe one cannot 
lack material. Miss Lansdale makes the most of 
all the associations of the city, as well as of its pic- 
turesque charm ; and particularly for those of her 
readers who are looking forward to visiting Vienna 
she has written a very interesting guide. 

From the press of Messrs. James Pott & Co. 
comes a book closely resembling, in make-up and 
illustration, the volumes on Japan and Vienna 



spoken of above. Its subject is " The Mediterra- 
nean," and it is the work of six writers whose vivid 
descriptions of the famous Mediterranean ports in 
Africa and Europe will be of value and interest 
not alone to travellers, but to all for whom the 
"venerable cities and storied ruins "associated with 
the Mediterranean have a perennial fascination. 
Twenty finely-executed plates in photogravure ad- 
mirably supplement the text. 

In her " Fictional Rambles in and about Boston " 
(McClure, Phillips & Co.) Miss Frances Weston 
Carruth takes her readers about new and old Boston 
and out to Cambridge. Lexington, and other historic 
suburbs, in search of the highways and homesteads 
that have been immortalized in " Boston fiction." 
If Europe is attractive because its great romances 
have made it so, likewise, Miss Carruth reasons, has 
Boston been the scene of much that is interesting in 
American fiction. But she straightway pricks her 
own bubble by adding that Boston's literary men 
were at first theologians, and later for the most part 
poets and essayists. She is therefore obliged to 
fall back on some rather unfamiliar novels, because 
the American classics do not give her sufficient 
material. Nevertheless the " Rambles " are very 
readable. Miss Carruth's interest in her subject is 
infectious ; and then, if you do not remember the 
fictional reference, you can glance across the page 
and see the place referred to, for almost half the 
book is made up of illustrations. These plates are 
all of them excellent, and combine with the gay blue 
cover, and the interest of the text, to make a de- 
lightful holiday book about Boston. 

Equally enthusiastic over another city, and for 
other reasons, is Mr. Jesse Lynch Williams. His 
"New York Sketches" (Scribner), now published 
in book-form, invite the reader to ramble with him 
along the water-front, walk up-town of a sunny 
afternoon, investigate the cross-streets of the city, 
and, venturing farther afield, test the actuality be- 
hind the phrase, " rural New York." It is not as- 
sociations, literary or historical, that interest Mr. 
Williams, but the pulsing humanity and fascinating 
variety of the great city as it stands today. The 
illustrations, which are by Messrs. Jules Gu^rin, 
Henry McCarter, W. R. Leigh, Charles L. Hinton, 
Ernest Peixotto, Everett Shinn, and others, show 
us New York from as many points of view as there 
are artists represented ; but all the drawings are 
striking and all bring out the city's picturesqueness, 
— the quality that Mr. Williams emphasizes. 

" The Quest of Happiness," with its message of 
hope and good cheer, is just the holiday gift to 
choose for a pessimistic or disheartened friend. He 
will have to gain the quest for himself, but Dr. 
Hillis's point of view cannot but prove interesting 
and suggestive. The author is neither a visionary 
nor a materialist. His feet are planted on the facts 
of life, but his outlook is optimistic, and he is of 
course a Christian philosopher, with a Christian's 
idea of the meaning of happiness. Thus his view 
of a hackneyed subject is fresh and inspiring. He

poshes his explorations to the depths of the sabject, 
and adorns every phase of it with a profasion of 
literary and historical allusions, interesting in them- 
selves, if not always quite accurate or pertinent to 
the main thesis. The serious treatment of the 
theme does not suggest a decorative edition, bat the 
publishers (Macmillan) have brought out the book 
in an ornate binding, with border designs in green 
on every page. 

In " An Old Country House " ( Harper & 
Brothers) Mr. Richard Le Gallienne is at his best. 
There are all sorts of quaintnesses for him to ex- 
ploit — the old gardens and the older house, a room 
full of moth-eaten folios, a newly married pair, and 
finally a real old English Christmas, with a Yule- 
log and carol-singers. All these are written of in 
Mr. Le Gallienne's dainty and highly finished style, 
and permeated with his delicate fancy. Miss Eliza- 
beth Shippen Green's softly-tinted illustrations ex- 
actly fit the text ; and paper, typography, and binding 
are all in harmony with the leborely, luxurious 
spirit of the writing. 

With the three new volumes — " Joshua and 
Judges," '• The Later Pauline Epistles," and " An 
Introduction to the Study of the Scriptures " by the 
Bishop of Ripon, — the "Temple Bible" (Lip- 
pincott) is complete in twenty-five volumes. By its 
convenient and dainty form, with each book or 
group of books printed separately, the principle of 
the natural growth and composite character of the 
Bible has been emphasized as it could be in no other 
way. The arrangement of the text by paragraphs 
instead of by arbitrarily divided verses cannot but 
aid intelligent reading. And the introductions, em- 
bodying the results of the best modern scholarship 
and written in a spirit alike rational and reverent, 
must be influential in unmasking the spectre of 
higher criticism ; an influence which the excellent 
general introduction to the whole series will greatly 
strengthen. The appearance of the small leather- 
covered volumes, with their attractive typography 
and beautiful photogravure frontispieces, is too well 
known to need description. Indeed the " Temple 
Edition " has already made a place for itself among 
those whose interest in the Bible is many-sided, 
who appreciate its supreme spiritual value, and yet, 
believing that real appreciation implies clear un- 
derstanding, wish to read and study it with the 
same earnest attention that they give to other great 
literature. 

With ten of the world's greatest paintings as 
points of departure. Dr. Amory H. Bradford ex- 
plains what is for him the spiritual significance 
of each, calling his book "Messages of the Masters" 
(Crowell). " These essays are not critical studies," 
the author tells us in his preface. "The one object 
in preparing them has been either to interpret the 
spiritual meaning of the painters or to follow the 
suggestions of their work." Thus from Murillo's 
" Holy Family " Dr. Bradford draws the theme of 
" The Sanctity of Human Love "; while Watts's 
" Sir Galahad " inspires a chapter on goodness, the 



crown of life; and Benouf's "The Pilot," one on 
"The Message and Ministry of the Sea." Each 
chapter is illustrated by a full-page photogravure 
of the painting discussed. The book is exceptionally 
well printed and handsomely bound. 

"The History of Mr. John Decastro and hia 
Brother Bat, Commonly Called Old Crab, the Merry 
Matter Written by John Mathers, the Grave by a 
Solid Gentleman ": — so runs the quaint title-page 
of one of the season's interesting reprints (Irwin 
Press). First published in 1815, mysterious as to 
authorship, neglected by the reviewers, but kept in 
memory in an esoteric fashion by an occasional bit 
of clever criticism, and eagerly in demand of late 
years among its little circle of admirers, "The 
History of Mr. John Decastro " has had a career 
unique in literary annals. A conjecture that the 
original dedication was to Lord Ormonde gives 
name to this " New Ormonde Edition," which the 
editor, Mr. William S. Walsh, and the publishers 
have aimed to present " in just the shape the au- 
thor would have approved were he still living in 
the flesh." The text has been but slightly modern- 
ized, and not expurgated at all, but left to stand 
as " an extraordinary efflorescence from the jovial, 
genial, boisterous, and none too squeamish Merry 
England of the Georges." A brilliant Introduc- 
tion by Mr. Walsh discusses the various answers 
that have from time to time been proposed to the 
quite insoluble question of the book's authorship, 
and characterizes the racy Rabelaisian humor of 
the satire, suggesting its probable influence upon 
Thackeray, and its undoubted indebtedness to the 
whimsical mockery of Fielding and Sterne. The 
edition is in two volumes, handsomely bound in half 
morocco. 

William Blake's famous illustrations for the 
Book of Job, twenty-one in number, have been 
reproduced in photogravure from the original etch- 
ings and issued in a folio volume bound in heavy 
cardboard, by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. These 
reproductions, which are of the same size as the 
now very rare originals, are the first to give any 
adequate impression of the strength and fantastic 
richness of Blake's best work. The present edition, 
which is limited, will be a great addition to any art 
library. 

Not limiting her field to our rather modern Amer- 
ican " antiquities " at all, Mrs. Alice Morse Earle 
has still kept pretty well within the geographical 
limits of the island of Great Britain and of the 
thirteen original States of the Union for the charm- 
ing materials that, culled and sorted, go to make up 
her " Sun-dials and Roses of Yesterday : Garden 
Delights which are Here Displayed in very Truth 
and are Moreover Regarded as Emblems " (Mac- 
mUlan). The qnaintness of a day far more remote 
than the mere passing of time can hint pervades 
the pleasant narrative, giving it a notable literary 
quality. Mrs. Earle passes from sun-dials to roses 
and back again with a unity of sentiment that makes 
the phrase in the sub-title of " Garden Delights "

wholly appropriate. The earlier two-thirds of the 
book is given over to sun-dials, and examples of 
this time-honored method of telling the time of day 
have been gathered from Italy, Greece, France, 
Germany, and even distant Mexico and Japan; but 
with hardly more than a single example from each 
of these countries. England and Scotland supply 
an element which, under Mrs. Earle's treatment, 
is not felt as foreign. These examples, delineated 
in both letter-press and illustration, are numerous 
and inclusive (the dial without the gnomon on 
Massachusetts Hall in Cambridge being the only 
instance of any note that seems to be omitted), and 
the whole constitutes a veritable encyclopaedia on 
the subject within the limits of civilization. Roses 
are discussed in something less of the discursive and 
more of the historical manner, but with the same play 
of delightful and thoroughly assimilated imagina- 
tion. The lines at the very close — the inside of 
the back cover — of the handsome volume, headed 
" The Authors Friend to the Booke," are so entirely 
in the spirit of the whole work that they may well 
be quoted. 

"Goe ventrous booke, thy selfe expose 

To learned men, and none but thoae ; 

For this carping age of ours 

Snuffes at all bnt choycest flowers, 

Cul'd from out the carious knots 

Of quaint writers garden plots ; 

These they smell at, these they savor. 

Yet not free from feare, nor favour : 

But if thou wert smel'd a right 

By a nose not stnft with spight, 

Thou to all that learning love 

Might'st a fragrant nosegay prove, 
So content thee, till due time, 
Blaze thy worth throughout this Clime." 

It is " To my Sister Alice Morse Earle" that Miss 
Frances Clary Morse dedicates her book on " Fur- 
niture of the Olden Time" (Macmillan). The 
author's recondite knowledge of her subject is 
strictly limited to examples of furniture actually 
within the United States and in many instances 
made here. But the wealth that came so freely 
in the early days enabled our ancestors to import 
from abroad, chiefly from England and Holland, 
the best specimens of the cabinet-makers there ; and 
Miss Morse is thus given the opportunity to include 
examples which fairly cover the period from the 
middle of the seventeenth to the middle of the 
nineteenth centuries — until the desperate philistin- 
ism which Richard Grant White so resented and 
William Morris so reformed, had closed upon us 
with its meaningless curves and stained " black " 
walnut. Though France until the Revolution con- 
tained the greatest of artists and handicraftsmen in 
the manufacture of household furniture, the omis- 
sion of all consideration of the charming instances 
of their work still so numerous in Louisiana gives 
Miss Morse's book narrowed and strictly defined lim- 
itations — necessary, perhaps, if the present volume 
was not to become unwieldy, but certainly worthy 
of a companion work to it at no distant day. Miss 
Morse's treatment is by chapters severally devoted 



to specific articles in customary use, as " Chests, 
Chests of Drawers, Dressing-tables," " Bureaus and 
Washstands," " Bedsteads," etc. Her narrative is 
free, unforced, and sufficiently succinct and well 
digested ; and almost every page contains a repro- 
duced photograph of some quaint or beautiful heir- 
loom. 

Mr. Guy Wetmore Carryl's " Grimm Tales Made 
Gay" (Houghton) is a collection of amusing tra- 
vesties, in verse, of certain familiar fairy stories, 
" Grimm " and otherwise. Among the tales, to 
quote from the rhymed table of contents, are those 
which tell us 
" How Rudeness and Kindness were Justly Rewarded, 

How Beauty Contrived to Get Square with the Beast, 
How a Fair One no Hope to His Highness Accorded, 

How Thomas a Maid from a Dragon Released," 

and so on. Each " gay " tale has an ingenious up- 
to-date moral, and is copiously illustrated by Mr. 
Albert Levering, in his usual grotesquely humorous 
style. 

"Penelope's Experiences in Ireland" by Mrs. Kate 
Douglas Wiggin is reprinted this year in an illus- 
trated holiday edition uniform with the other vol- 
umes in the Penelope series (Houghton). Mr. 
Charles E. Brock, the illustrator of the series, is an 
adept at drawing Irish types, and the sketches that 
head each chapter are as good in their way as the 
text, the delightful humor of which is too familiar 
to need comment. 

Thoroughly Ingoldsbian in spirit is the new edi- 
tion of the immortal "Jackdaw of Rheims" (Young), 
illustrated by Mr. Ernest Maurice Jessop. Mr. 
Jessop has caught the whimsical humor of the poet- 
antiquary perfectly. His drawings are full of the 
same solemn fooling and rollicking wit that char- 
acterize the verses. He pictures everything, and, 
from the poor little Jackdaw with drooping head 
and rumpled feathers to the microscopic red hat 
that always stands above the Cardinal's name, 
everything is charming, — except perhaps the Car- 
dinal himself, who is hardly impressive enough for 
so exalted a personage. The decorations, printed 
in two colors, are as artistic in general effect as they 
are humorous in detail. The volume is bound in 
unassuming brown boards with a picture of the 
Jackdaw on the cover. 

Two delightful essays in Thackeray's most char- 
acteristic critical style, which have somehow almost 
escaped the notice of the bibliographers, are now 
published together in a choice limited edition by 
Messrs. H. W. Fisher & Co. of Philadelphia. Both 
essays originally appeared in " Fraser's Magazine," 
and both are satires upon the old-time Christmas 
"Annual," now happily defunct. " A Word on the 
Annuals," so Mr. Almon Dexter tells us in the in- 
troductory note, appeared a year before " Our An- 
nual Execution." The former has never before been 
reprinted, and the latter only once — in the "Mis- 
cellanies " of Messrs. Fields, Osgood & Co.'s edition 
of Thackeray. The little book is bound in green 
watered silk, after the manner of the berated an-

neat ease. It sboald form a rare prize to collectors. 

The bringing together of a great collection of 
European paintings, scnlptares, and objeU d'art in 
the Fine Art Loan Collection of the Glasgow Inter- 
national Exposition of 1901. gave Mr. D. S. Mac- 
Coll the opportunity he has made inch good use of in 
his " Nineteenth Century Art " (Macmillan ). This 
handsome folio has for its letter-press a long and 
searching historical criticism of painting and sculp- 
ture during the century just closed, the numerous 
full-page illastrations being taken from the exam- 
ples on view during the Exposition. Hardly a great 
name among the moderns is neglected, either by the 
text or pictures. The painters are arranged in 
schools, chapter by chapter, as far as possible, the 
question of nationality not entering into considera- 
tion at all except where a school has risen and per- 
sists in a single nation. Mr. Whistler is the only 
American artist mentioned at length, and the United 
States are not considered in any aspect. Though 
an impression mast remain that Mr. MacCoU has 
attempted to cover too much in a single volume 
containing no great amount of reading matter, his 
work is nevertheless conscientious and painstaking, 
and is informed with a practical knowledge of both 
French and English art. The illustrations, num- 
bering not less than a hundred plates, many of them 
photogravures of exceptional quality, form a most 
interesting collection. The beautiful typography 
and binding also call for a word of praise. A more 
-desirable gift for an art-loving friend could hardly 
be found among this season's publications. 

Mr. E^gar Mayhew Bacon has written an inter- 
esting account of " The Hudson from Ocean to 
Source " (Putnam). He considers his subject from 
three points of view : as important because of its 
history, for the legends that cluster about it, and 
for its picturesque scenery. The mat«rial is ar- 
ranged chronologically in part, and in part it follows 
the course of the stream northward. The story of 
the growth of the modern city of New York is of 
course excluded, as being a history in itself ; but the 
struggles and achievements of the Dutch settlers, as 
well as of the adventurous spirits who pushed their 
way northward into the wilderness are narrated 
interestingly, in detail. Over one hundred illastra- 
tions depict scenes along the river. 

In a two-volume edition, bound in white and gold, 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons reprint the original 
Moxon folio edition of Tennyson's " Idylls of the 
King." with its thirty beautiful Ulnstratiotis by 
Gustove Dor^. Four of the •' Idylls " — '• Enid," 
" Vivien," " Elaine," and •• Guinevere " — are here 
included. The paper and typography are unusually 
attractive, and the photogravure reproductions are 
marrellous approximations to the original engrav- 
ings. The book will be a rare treasure to the lover 
of artistic editions. 

" Songs of Two Centuries " ( Harper) is the title 
given to a new book of poems by Mr. Will Carleton, 
'written, as the name suggests, in the last years of 



the nineteenth and the first of the twentieth eentorj, 
and dedicated to the memory of the one and the 
success of the other. The poems are grouped under 
snb-titles, a citation of which will serve to show how 
varied is the contents of the volume. There are 
" Songs of Months and Days," •' Songs of Home 
Life," of the Rivers and the Mountains, of the 
Nation, of Pleasure and Pain. Some are written 
in the quaint dialect which we associate with Mr. 
Carleton, others are in more serious vein and mora 
conventional English. The volume is liberally illus- 
trated from original drawings and photographs. 

Mr. James Whitcomb Riley's well known poem 
"An Old Sweetheart of Mine" is now published 
by the Bowen-Merrill Co. in a holiday edition, with 
Mr. Howard Chandler Christy's illustrations in del- 
icate color, and tinted subordinate decorations by 
Miss Virginia Keep. The poem, as published hith- 
erto in Mr. Riley's works, has contained only eleven 
stanzas, though the audiences that have heard the 
writer's public recitation of his lines have been 
able to realize that the spoken version had a rocmd 
eighteen stanzas. The missing seven are now for 
the first time allowed to appear in print. Mr. 
Christy's pictures follow closely the sentiment of the 
poem, and Miss Keep's floral wreaths are daintily 
conceived and colored. 

The Macmillan Co. have this year added a selec- 
tion from the poems of Shelley to their " Endymioa 
Series." As in the Keats volume in the same serial, 
Prof. Walter Raleigh has written the introduction 
and Mr. Robert Anning Bell has abundantly de- 
corated and illostrated the book, and designed the 
cover and end-papers. Mr. Bell's symbolic draw- 
ings are evidently intended as a beautiful setting 
suggested by the poetry, rather than as intellectual 
interpretations of it. They are wholly in harmony 
with Shelley's strange, evasive spirit, and lend new 
charm to the lyrics that make up the bulk of this 
selection. 

" In re-writing these volumes," says Hawthorne 
in his preface to " The Marble Faun," " the author 
was somewhat surprised to see the extent to which 
he had introduced descriptions of various Italian 
objects, antique, pictorial, and statuesque." It is 
this strongly marked Roman setting that has been 
farther emphasized by sixteen half-tone illastra- 
tions in the new " Luxembourg" edition (Crowell) 
of this, the most popular of Hawthorne's romances. 
An introduction by Miss Katharine Lee Bates also 
calls attention to the close relation between the de- 
scriptive element in the romance and the jottings 
of the " Italian Note-books." The present edition 
is printed on good paper, and handsomely and 
durably boand in scarlet and gold. 

" The Social Comedy " is a handsome quarto vol- 
ume, containing over a hundred line and half-tone 
drawings. It is issued by the Life Pablishing Com- 
pany, and the pictures are representative of the 
sort of clever and genial satire on the seamy side of 
polite society, for which "Life" is famous. The 
drawings are carefully printed on heavy coated

paper, and the artistic red and gold binding is in 
keeping with the contents of the book. 

That ever-flowering yew d'esprit of the Reverend 
Richard Barham's, " The Ingoldsby Legends ; or, 
Mirth and Marvel, by Thomas Ingoldsby, Esquire," 
has been reprinted in delightful form by John 
Lane, with scores of humorously interpretive illus- 
trations by Mr. Herbert Cole. The volume, bound 
in red with a delectable cover design stamped in 
gold, contains the prefaces to the first and second 
editions, the three series of legends in both prose 
and verse complete, and the miscellaneous poems 
added for good measure. 

Growing interest in Franciscan studies is attested 
by the publication of the fourth edition of " The 
Lady Poverty" (Tennant & Ward), as translated 
and edited by Mr. Montgomery Carmichael. This 
quaint little mediaeval allegory of St. Francis's de- 
votion to poverty is here translated into simple and 
stately English, often Biblical but never disagreeably 
archaic, which preserves all the freshness and reality 
that the story must have had for its unknown author. 
A photogravure reproduction of Giotto's " Espous- 
als of St. Francis to the Lady Poverty " is given as a 
frontispiece. In its very attractive typography and 
tasteful binding, this dainty volume holds a promi- 
nent place among the inexpensive gift-books of the 
season. 

Sir Gilbert Parker's tale of " The Lane That Had 
No Turning," which, when first published, gave 
the title to a volume of short stories, is now printed 
separately in holiday dress, with decorations and 
illustrations by Mr. Frank E. Schoonover. Besides 
the end-papers and numerous head and tail-pieces, 
there are seven full-page half-tone plates, illustra- 
ting as many dramatic moments in the story. The 
cover is very artistic, with its delicate fawn ground- 
work, green lettering, and dainty picture of Made- 
linette among the apple blossoms. (Doubleday.) 

Mr. Harper Pennington has made eight illustra- 
tions in color for the new edition of Mrs. Nancy 
Huston Banks's popular novel, " Oldfield " (Mac- 
millan Co.). The drawings are quaint, but rather 
too highly colored, and scarcely dainty or delicate 
enough to fit the Cranford-like quality of the Old- 
field ladies ; so that it is doubtful if they add much 
to the reader's enjoyment of this very charming 
old-time romance. The typography of the volume 
is excellent, and the cover artistic in color and 
design. 

Magazine readers will remember Mr. W. D. 
Ellwanger's graceful lyrics, some of which are now 
collected in an entertaining volume under the title 
" A Summer Snowflake and Drift of Other Verse 
and Song" (Doubleday, Page & Co.). With wide 
margins and illuminated initials the pages present 
an attractive appearance. There is a frontispiece 
by Mr. A. B. Wenzell ; and a snowflake design on 
the cover gives the book a holiday air. 

Two popular illustrators. Miss Jessie Willcox 
Smith and Miss Elizabeth Shippen Green, have col- 
laborated in the preparation of a charming calendar 



called " The Child," issued by Mr. Charles W. Beck, 
Jr., of Philadelphia. There are seven large-sized 
pictures in colors, representing quaint little folk 
amusing themselves appropriately to the various 
seasons. The color-printing is remarkably good, 
and altogether this is perhaps the most artistic and 
attractive of the calendars for the coming year. 

In this busy age we no longer write journals for 
our descendants to gloat over, but diaries are still a 
necessity, and for the new woman quite as much as 
for her brother man. The special features of the 
" Lest We Forget " Standard Diary for 1903 (Cam- 
bridgeport Diary Co.) are clearly set forth on the 
title page, where it is said to be " A Book for Ladies' 
Use, in which to record Memoranda, Engagements, 
etc., with special pages for Church Notes, Club 
Notes, Dinners, Weddings, Days at Home, Card 
Parties, Record of Guests, Household Inventories, 
Birthdays, etc." On each page ap])ears the proper 
date and the motto " Lest we forget." The diary 
is of convenient size, and is prettily bound in red 
cloth. 

" The Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 
1903 " (Elder & Shepard) is an amusing booklet 
constituting a calendar and memorandum combined, 
with scarlet page-borders and daily — or rather 
weekly — food in the form of familiar proverbs 
revised in the interests of the cynic. " Many are 
called but few get up," " Economy is the thief of 
time," " As you sew, so must you rip," " A word to 
the wise is resented," " Pride will have a Fall bon- 
net," " God gives us our relatives — thank God we 
can choose our friends," are a few crumbs of the 
delicious " wisdom," which we are all of us cynics 
enough to enjoy. The checked gingham cover is 
unique. 

The " Love Poems of Herrick," edited by Mr. 
Frederic Chapman, is the latest volume in the 
"Lover's Library" (John Lane). In decoration 
it is uniform with the rest of the miniature series : 
there is a dainty violet pattern in gold on the purple 
cover, and marginal designs of violets, rings, and 
true-lover's knots. Herrick's love-note is unique 
and charming, and his lyrics seem especially appro- 
priate, by virtue of their light touch and playful 
fancy, for inclusion in the tiny gift-books of this 
charming series. 

Unusual both in subject-matter and make-up is 
" A Balloon Ascension at Midnight " (Elder & 
Shepard), by Mr. George Eli Hall. It is an au- 
thentic account of the author's first balloon trip, 
made from Paris, in June, 1901, in company with 
a venturesome young Frenchman. The story is 
tersely and vividly written, from the artist's, not the 
scientist's, point of view ; and Mr. Gordon Ross has 
drawn a series of silhouettes in color, which empha- 
size both the wierd and the humorous phases of the 
adventure. 

Messrs. Martin Ross and E. CE. Somerville have 
furnished respectively the text and illustrations 
for the volume entitled " A Patrick's Day Hunt " 
(Dutton ). The day's misadventures are cleverly told

A beantifnl edition of " Don Qoizote of 
La Mancha " has been made this season 
for the use of children bj Messrs. J. M. 
Dent & Co. of London (imported by Dntton). The long 
disquisitions on the drama and other subjects of interest 
to their elders only are here omitted, and namerons 
illustrations worthy the clear print and fine paper are 
supplied by Mr. W. Heath Robinson. — Mr. Paul Cres- 
wiek has added another to the nnmerous renderings into 
prose of " Robin Hood and his Adventures " (Dutton), 
for which Mr. T. H. Robinson has provided an abun- 
dance of pictures, many in color and stUl more in black 
and white. The narrative is fluent and sufficiently 
simple. — Charles Dickens's interesting and inaccurate 
« A Child's History of England " appears in an edition 
sumptuously illustrated by Mr. Patten Wilson, aud 
published by Messrs. Dent of London (imported by 
Dutton). This beautiful edition is certain to meet 
with a favorable reception. — An authentic account 
of "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" has been 
prepared for Messrs. Crowell's series of " Children's 
Favorite Classics," with an introduction detailing the 
sources of this series of incredibilities. Some designs 
of appropriate droUness illustrate the book fittingly. — 
Johanna Spyri's " Heidi " has been translated by Miss 
Helene S. White for the same series, and deserves the 
welcome among English-speaking children it has long 
been accorded in its own Germany as a simple story of 
child Ufe in the Alps. There are a colored frontispiece 
and other illustrations. — Miss Constance £. Maud has 
derived the materials for her " Heroines of Poetry " 
(John Lane) from a number of sources. William 
Morris's "Maid of the Swan Skin," Malory's "Fair 
Maid of Astolat," Longfellow's " The Peasant Biaid " 
and " Minnehaha, Laughing Water," Eeats's " The 
Serpent Woman," Tennyson's " The Learned Princess," 
Browning's » The Little Duchess," and several more, 
have been turned into very pretty prose, the sources of 
them all (though the titles have been changed as well 
as the text) being familiar to all lovers of verse. The 
charming illustrative designs, one for each tale, are in 
Mr. Henry Ospovat's best manner. — A minor literary 
curiosity comes to hand in the form of " Mary Had a 
Little Lamb : The True Story of the Real Mary and 
the Real Lamb, As Told by Fannie M. Dickerson and 
by Mary Herself" (Stokes), to follow the wording of 
the title-page. The author of the first three stanzas of 
this perennial favorite was, it appears, John Roulstone 
of Sterling, Massachusetts, nephew of the settled min- 
ister there ; the Mary was Mary £. Sawyer, and the 
teacher a Miss Kimball. Who composed the last three

stanras is not made clear, but it is stated that they ap- 
peared first in a book of children's verse published by 
Mrs. Sarah Joseph. Little Miss Sawyer duly became 
Mrs. Tyler, and survived nntil December, 1889, having 
been bom in 1806. The lamb seems to have learned 
the secret of perennial lambhood, according to Mrs. 
Dickerson, who records of her and her mistress, " As 
the years passed, they skipped over the fields and 
meadows together, . . . Mary . . . and the lamb," 
but on a sad Thanksgiving morning the lamb (still a 
lamb, though the mother of twins) was tossed by a 
eow and died of it. Mrs. Dickerson tells the story first, 
then the account of Mrs. Tyler is quoted, and the book 
oioaea with the authentic version of the poem. — SonM- 
tting more than a mere child's book is Mia. Mabel 
Osgood Wright's " Dogtown, Being Some Chapters 
from the Annals of the Waddles Family, Set Down in 
the Language of Honsepeople" (Macmillau), a serene 
and pleasant story of weli ordered country life, where 
dogs seem to have a much easier life than most folk 
with immortal souls. It is really charming to read, full 
of humor, and with a love story to give it interest to 
all ages. 

•* Ralph Wynward " (Nelson) is a story 
of Ireland in the days of Queen Elizabeth 
(not " good " Queen Bess to the Irish, 
at any rate), by Mr. H. Elrington, in which the heir 
to a family of old descent and high station runs away 
from home and becomes involved in the uprising of his 
kinsman, the Earl of Desmond. He is not much of a 
hero, this uncouth Hampshire lad, but he is abundantly 
human. — Colonel H. R. Gordon takes a notable figure 
from aboriginal life in colonial days for the central in- 
terest in "Logan the Mingo" (Dutton), and makes 
the story interesting to boys by associating two youthful 
eoosins with the history of that heroic victim of the 
white man's perfidy. The tale is sympathetically told, 

and deserves a favorable reception Ijoumalism and 

juvenilia come close to coincidence in Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer's "The Young Volcano Explorers; or, 
American Boys in the West Indies " (Lee & Shepard). 
The schoolboys who were left in Venezuela in the 
author's earlier story " Lost on the Orinoco " turn up 
in time to see the eruption of Mount Pel^e, and some 
virid description results. — " How the Twins Captured 
a Hessian " (Crowell) is by Mr. James Otis, and gives 
a pleasant account of the way in which two little Long 
Island boys took possession of one of King George's 
mercenaries, while the British lion was still ramping up 
and down between New York and Philadelphia. — Out 
of the unsuccessful war waged by the United States for 
the liberation of the Cuban people (unsuccessful, that 
ia, in the sense of freeing them from an irresponsible 
tyranny) comes the material for Mrs. Harriet T. 
Comstoek's « A Little Dusky Hero " (Crowell). This 
latest addition to the vast body of heroes of the Spanish 
war is the little negro who acts as body-servant to the 
colonel of an American regiment, and saves that war- 
rior's life upon occasion. The story is unquestionably 

interesting Rather old for the average boy, since it 

deals with "meu"in college, Mr. Homer Greene's "Whis- 
pering Tongues" (Crowell) tells of the way in which two

character put to the severest test. — " Jack and Black "

the reader kept guessing accordingly. — The hero of 
Mrs. Molesworth's " Peterkin " (Macmillau) is a little 
boy who discovers a sort of fairy princess for himself 
through a parrot in which he is interested, and bravely 
goes to a neglected little girl's rescue with unforeseen 
results. It is in the equable and pleasant manner of

the most modern inventions made possible by electricians

who know Mr. Bangs's work — - and who does not ? —

where a worthy spinster of an age the reverse of uncer- 
tain adopts a remote and youthful cousin newly orphaned. 
After developing the humor abundantly, the hobblede-

which set Miss De Peyster quite as good an example as 

she has been setting him " Penn Shirley " has another 

volume in the long series of her works for children, 
this latest being named " Boy Donald and his Hero " 
(Lee & Shepard). The scene is laid in California, 
and the "hero" is Donald's elder brother, who does 
notable things in the narrative. The illustrations are 
by Miss Bertha G. Davidson, — " Young George : His 
Life" (Stokes) is an amusing series of pictures in color 
by Miss Edith Farmiloe, who has also added the neces- 
sary letter-press to give those who are attracted by the 
bot)k a glimpse at the meaning of a little London lad's 
existence. The child is of or near the gutter, but as 
quaint and amusing as possible, and with far greater 
opportunities for an exciting career than most of his 
more fortunate but conventional fellows ever know. 

Of equal interest to boys and girls, since

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page has added another mite to 
a better understanding between the North and South 
with " A Captured Santa Claus " (Scribner), the civil 
war being the background for the really touching epi- 
sode which gives the story its title. A Confederate 
colonel braves capture as a spy to keep a promise to 
his children at Christmastide, and falls in the bands of 
a federal general who has little ones of his own at home. 
But the small rebel who understands his father's plight

being in the enemy's ranks out of uniform. It is a touch-

W. L. Jacobs Mr. Hervey White, hitherto known as 

a novelist of decided but sombre power, puts his lit- 
erary past behind him to write " Noll and the Fairies " 
(Stone), a most amusing bit of imaginative writing for 
which the tender infancy of Oliver Goldsmith affords a 
basis. Not only is it written in sparkling prose, but 
there are numerous bits of interpolated verse, some of 
it purposely nonsensical, but all charming. What is 
more astonishing than these, however, is Mr. White's 
embodiment of some sound modern child psychology in 
the book without in the least overweighting it Out 



of the literature surviving from the world's childhood, 
Miss Florence Holbrook has obtained the material for 
her " Book of Nature Myths " (Houghton), certainly the 
most suitable mental pabulum imaginable for children. 
From the classics, the sagas, and the legends of the 
American Indians, Miss Holbrook has drawn her mate- 
rial, beginning her little volume with simple expressions 
increasing in complexity and maturity of thought as 
they proceed. Such thorough and discriminating work 

can hardly have too much praise " Lays for Little 

Chaps " (New Amsterdam Book Co.) is the rather con- 
ventional sort of verse about children, done by Mr. Alfred 
James Waterhouse after the manner of Eugene Field. 

There are numerous illustrations " The Caxton Club " 

(Crowell) is a transcript of more than ordinary realism, 
telling of the difficulties three boys and a girl have in 
starting a newspaper in a little Ohio community. " Noth- 
ing," says Emerson " is so small as the smallness of 
a small town," and the saying might serve as the motto^ 
for this story. It is written by Mr. Amos R. Wells. 
— Miss Mary D. Brine's book, " Lassie and Laddie " 
(Dutton) is a pretty story of two little cousins and 
what tbey do in the country after a long separation. 
It is for very small children indeed Great good na-

Miss Katharine M. Roberts provides illustrations of

Yechton loses nothing of a certain admirable quality 
noticeable in her other work when she comes to write 
" Molly " (Crowell). The picture she draws is that of 
a little girl who spends a summer with an uncle and 
some oousins and makes them all her friends by her 

straightforward courage and small-womanliness 

Bringing a little child from the poorest parts of a large 
American city to a prosperous farm works much better 
in Miss Evelyn Raymond's " Daisies and Diggleses " 
(Crowell) than it has been found to in real life. It is 
characteristic of the little tenement house girl that she 
should begin planning for those she has left behind her 
as soon as she finds the rural districts inhabitable

" The I Can School " (Crowell) is Miss Eva A. Mad- 
den's name for an institution of learning in a large city 
where a small girl receives much more than mere book- 
knowledge through the wisdom of her teachers. 

"Miss Muff et's Christmas Party'VEough- 
^^ / /i. '*">) brings into a single little story the 

people that children of all sorts like to 
find there, and Miss Olive M. Long's pictures consort 
with Mr. Samuel &I. Crothers's narrative in making the 

book one well worth having " The Outlook Story 

Book " (Outlook Co.) is a compilation of tales in prose 
and verse, with numerous pictures, wherein many bands 
have been at work. It is, as the title goes on to say, 
" for little people," and few of these will fail to find 
interest in its pages. — Of a similar sort is the " Wee 
Folks' Annual " (Button) which Mr. Alfred J. Fuller 
has edited and arranged, but this is intended for still 
smaller children. — Thirty stories of all kinds, but with 
children always prominent in them, have been written 
by Mrs. Evelyn Everett-Green and published under the 
title " Short Tales from Fairyland" (Button). Pictures 
in color and in black and white by Mrs. Seymour Lucas 
and Miss Eveline Lance make the volume a most attrac- 
tive one. In " The Animals' Rebellion " (Button) Mr. 
Clifton Bingham tells in rhyme of the manner in which 
the Tiger, the Brown Bear, and the Wolf set about 
overthrowing the throne of King Leo, and the way the 
charge of the Giraffe cavalry upset all their hopes at 
the critical moment. Most elaborate and amusing are 
the colored pictures by Mr. C. H. Thomson which illus- 
trate the verses. — Last year Mr. L. J. Bridgman pro- 
vided both text and illustrations for " Guess," in which 
riddles of the kind children dearly love were asked on 
one page and answered when the leaf was turned. This 
same idea he has expanded in " Guess Again " (H. M. 
Caldwell Co.) with results equally happy. Especially 
witty are the end papers, showing the " Conun-Brnm 
Corps " on parade. — Curious little creatures, not unlike 
Mr. Palmer Cox's brownies, are busy in the pages of 
" Kewts " (H. M. Caldwell Co.), also the invention 
of Mr. L. J. Bridgman. The Kewts are sent to visit all 
the states and territories of the Union by their inventor, 
and a page is devoted to a rhymed account of the in- 
dustries they discover under way in each of the com- 
monwealths they visit, with a picture showing them in 
the act of inspection or participation. The idea is 
both ingenious and instructive. 



Notes. 



" The Vicar of Wakefield," with a preface by Mr. 
Austin Bobson and illustrations by Mr. Hugh Thomson, 
is published by the Macmillan Co. in a pretty and inex- 
pensive holiday edition. 

Two new preprints from the Becennial Publications 
of the University of Chicago are as follows: " The 
Lecithans," by Mr. Waldemar Koch ; and " Studies in 
Popular Poetry," by Mr. Philip Schuyler Allen. 

The American Book Co. publish a " Mental Arith- 
metic " prepared for elementary schools by Mr. I. C. 
McNeill. 

A " List of Books for High School Libraries of the 
State of Wisconsin," prepared under the direction of 
State Superintendent L. B. Harvey, is a publication 
that will be welcomed by schools everywhere. The 
titles number about sixteen hundred and are intelli- 



gently annotated, the work making a volume of nearly 
five hundred pages. 

" The Sources of Plutarch's Life of Cicero," by Pro- 
fessor Alfred Gudeman, is a recent publication of the 
University of Pennsylvania. 

" Tom Grogan " and " Gondola Bays " make up the 
fifth and sixth volumes of the new uniform edition of 
Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith's writings. The Messrs. Scrib- 
ner are the publishers. 

" Greek Myths in English Bress," edited by Pro- 
fessor Edward Everett Hale, Jr., is a small volume for 
school use made up from Hawthorne, Kingsley, and 
Bnlfinch, and published by tbe Globe School Book Co. 

That old-time favorite, " The Lamplighter," by Maria 
Susanna Cummings, is issued in a new edition by Messrs. 
Hongbton, Mifflin & Co. An interesting " publishers' 
note " tells something of the author and the history of 
her book. 

" The Poems of Ovid," edited by Professor Charles 
Wesley Bain, form a volume in Macmillan's "Latin 
Series." There are nearly two hundred pages of 
selected text, and a copious apparatus of notes and 
vocabulary. 

Miss Ella M. Sexton's " Stories of California " (Mae- 
millan) are told in simple language, and are addressed 
to a youthful audience. They relate not only to the 
early history of the State, but also to its industrial de- 
velopment, and are well illustrated. 

Messrs. Tennant & Ward are tbe publishers of three 
practical handbooks upon certain phases of the art of 
photography. Their respective subjects are " The Lens," 
"Finishing the Negative," and "Photographic Appar- 
atus." Mr. (reorge £. Brown is the author of all three 
books. 

" An Elementary Commercial Geography," by Mr. 
Cyrus C. Adams, published by Messrs. B. Appleton & 
Co., is a response to the growing need of books for in- 
struction in the commercial courses of our high schools. 
It is abundantly illustrated with maps and photographs. 

" The Splendid Idle Forties " (Macmillan), by Mrs. 
Gertrude Atherton, is a revised and enlarged edition of 
the volume of stories originally entitled " Before the 
Gringo Came." There are also illustrations, and they 
are of a sort that tempt one to search the text to find 
out what they represent 

The " Stories in Stone from the Roman Forum " 
(Macmillan), which Miss Isabel Loveli has prepared 
for young students of ancient history, presents in simple 
and readable form some of the results of recent archs- 
ological work in the great city. It is an excellent piece 
of work, and teachers will find it very helpful. 

A reprint of Clarence King's " Mountaineering in the 
Sierra Nevada," which comes from the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner, will be welcome to many readers. This fascinating 
work was first published in 1871, but was soon there- 
after withdrawn from the market by tbe author, who 
wished to correct it in certain particulars, a task which 
he never found time to perform. 

The extraordinary vitality of Carlyle's "French Rev- 
olution " is attested by the new editions that appear 
with great frequency. No year has passed of late in 
which one or more such reprints have not found their 
way to our table. The three-volume edition just pub- 
lished by tbe Messrs. Putnam is, however, much more 
than a reprint. It is tbe edition of a competent histor- 
ical scholar, Mr. C. R. L. Fletcher, who has provided it 
with many maps and plans, and also with the critical

apparatus of notes which are absolutely necessary for the 
reader whose intent is historical as well as literary. 
The set is included in " Putnam's Library of Standard 
Literature," favorably known by several other reprints. 

" From the Old World to the New," by Miss Mar- 
guerite Stockman Dickson, is a book for children in 
elementary schools. It deals with the period of early 
American exploration and settlement, and has a great 
many pictures of a kind calculated to attract the child- 
ish interest. It is published by the Macmillan Co. 

" The American Jewish Year Book " for 5663, edited 
by Dr. Cyrus Adler for the Jewish Publication Society 
of America, is chiefly devoted to information concerning 
the Jewish organizations of the country. Its special 
features include articles on " The Jewish Population of 
Maryland " and " The History of the Jews in the United 
States." 

Miss Katharine Preseott Wormeley has undertaken 
to translate the " Impressions de Voyage " that Alex- 
andre Dumas produced in such profusion during the 
earlier part of his career, and the first volume of 
this venture, " The Speronara," is now at hand from 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. May it speedily be fol- 
lowed by all the others ! 

" How to Live," by the Rev. Edward Everett Hale, 
is a series of fifteen papers prepared for Chautauquans 
a number of years ago. These little homilies on the 
conduct of life are characterized by Dr. Hale's well 
known practical sense and felicity of phrasing. They 
are now collected into a volume which is published by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

Condensations of standard works do not as a rule meet 
with our favor, but we are willing to make an exception 
in the case of "A Short Life of Abraham Lincoln," 
just published by the Century Co. This is a single- 
volume edition of the ten-volume work by Messrs. 
Nicolay and Hay, the abridgment having been made 
by Mr. John G. Nicolay. The complete work is so 
much more than a mere biography, that the present 
condensation is not only justifiable but even praise- 
worthy. Even now there are nearly six hundred pages 
of the biography, which ought to be enough for the 
majority of readers. 

The volume of " Select Translations from Old Eng- 
lish Poetry " (Ginn) which has been edited by Messrs. 
Albert S. Cook and Chauncy B. Tinker, presents a se- 
lected series of versions, partly familiar and partly 
made for the present work, from the literature created 
by those men who were English poets centuries before 
Chaucer was born. The selections are typical, and 
cover a wide range of theme and literary form. Beo- 
wulf is represented by a few brief extracts, the battles 
of Rounanbush and Maldon are given in full, there are 
many passages from the Csedmon, Andreas, and Elene 
manuscripts, and lyrics both secular and religious. A 
very fair notion of the body of old English poetry is 
thus given within a brief compass, and the book will 
prove a boon to both special students and general 
readers. 

The " Nonsense Anthology " (Soribner) of Miss Caro- 
lyn Wells is a book that will bring joy to both young 
and old. Miss Wells has an appreciation of fooling that 
is not a common attribute of her sex, and a sense of 
humor that is exemplified by many delightful produc- 
tions of her own. In making the selections for the 
present volume she has shown excellent judgment and 
a wide acquaintance with the special sort of verse that 
is concerned. She gives us examples from a wide range 



of authors, including several seventeenth century 
examples, and coming down through Lear, " Lewis 
Carroll," and Gilbert to such whimsical writers of to- 
day as Mr. Gelett Burgess and Mr. Oliver Herford- 
Macaronic verse is also illustrated, and there is a 
clever Latin version of " Jabberwockey " called " Mors 
labrochii." This is anonymous, and, in fact, the num- 
ber of anonymous pieces included is noticeably large. 
There is also an excellent profusion of " Limericks." 

Professor Hjalmar Edgren, having given us, with the 
collaboration of Professor Percy Burnet, one of the best 
of modern French and English dictionaries, now comes 
forward with " An Italian and English Dictionary " 
(Holt), which he has prepared with the help of Dr. 
Giuseppe Bico and Mr. John L. Gerig. Such a work as 
this was greatly needed, and is (unlike its French com- 
panion) practically without a rival. Although not an 
etymological dictionary, sufficient attention is given to 
etymology to satisfy the needs of the ordinary student, 
and English cognates, when not perfectly obvious, are 
emphasized by being given in small capitals. Pronun- 
ciation is indicated by subscript signs, and accentuation 
is carefully marked. The vocabulary is large, and in- 
cludes such obsolete forms as the student is likely to 
meet with in the older classics.

"The Dial" has always stood for character. It has 
the old Pnritan couaoience on which everything that is 
lasting in our country is built. It is sane, wise, truthful ; 
it is honest, hopeful, and kindly, and with all this it is the 
best journal of literary criti- 
cism which we have, and we 
ask no better. 

David Starr Jordan.

"Tlie Dial" seems at present tlie most unbiased, 
good liumored, and sensible organ of American 
criticism. —BARRETT WENDELL 

In " Literary History of America." 



The good sense, the sound critical judgment, the liberal 
spirit, the high principles of '* The Dial," all maintained 
with simplicity, steadiness, and without pretension, have 
secured the respect as well as the cordial regard of its 
readers. 

Charles Eliot Norton.

" The Dial " is easily our 
most valuable literary review. It has been faithful to the 
best literary traditions from the first, and will no doubt 
continue to be so. John Burroughs. 

West Paek, N. Y., April 7, 1900. 



"The Dial" has uniformly 
directed its energies to the 
work of upholding the best 
standards of literary criticism in this country. It has done 
this with dignity, courage, and strength.

OURS is the largest establishment in this country 
devoted exclusively to books and stationery. 
Above all it is the ideal place for holiday book, buying, 
as the stock is so complete that patrons can be practi- 
cally assured of finding any publication desired without 
inconvenient delay. 

From now^ on every facility of our retail department 
— every convenience and assistance that w^e can offer — 
is at the entire disposal of customers who are engaged 
in the perplexing selection of books for holiday presen- 
tation. Patrons from out of town will appreciate the 
comfortable reading-room where catalogues may be 
consulted, books examined, letters written, or appoint- 
ments kept as desired. 

In regard to the desirability of books as Christmas 
gifts, nothing else is likely to give the same amount of 
pleasure at a relative cost. And it may be added that 
never before has the array of holiday books been so 
beautiful, so varied, and so altogether attractive from 
every standpoint. This is particularly true of the books 
for young people, which seem to have been the subject 
of special eflort on the part of the publishers this season.

The Philippine Islands -1493 -1803 



EXPLORATIONS by early Navigators, descriptions of the Islands 
and their Peoples, their History, and records of the Catholic 
Missions, as related in contemporaneous books and manuscripts, 
showing the political, economic, commercial, and religious conditions 
of those Islands from their earliest relations with European Nations 
to the beginning of the nineteenth century. 

Translated from the rare originals (Spanish, French, ItaUan, Latin, etc.). many 
of which are now published for the first time; edited and annotated by Emma 
Helen Blair,' A.M., of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, assistant 
editor of Tbe Jesuit T^elations and tAUied Documents, and James Alexander 
Robertson, Ph.B.; with historical introduction and notes by Edward 
Gaylord Bourne, Professor of History in Yale University, chairman of the 
Historical Manuscripts Commission of the American Historical Association, 
etc.; and special contributions by well-known scholars and bibliographers. 
Also a full Bibliography and Analytical Index. 

Illustrated with facsimiles of rare and unique originals, manuscripts, maps, 
portraits, views, etc. 

The edition is limited to one thousand numbered and signed sets. Printed 
in the beautiful Caslon type on Dickinson's hand-made deckle-edged paper. 
55 vols, (issued one or two vols, per month until completion, Vol. I. to be 
published about Jan. I'), 190?). Large 8vo, about 325 pages per volume, 
cloth, uncut, gilt top. Price, $AW net per volume. 

The difficulties which confront the people of the United States in the administration of their new 
insular possessions render this work especially timely and useful. Its chief aims, throughout, are 
to cast light on the great Philippine problem — by miking accessible to the reading public the history 
of those Islands, both religious and secular, and showing the character, customs, and beliefs of tbe 
native peoples who inhabit them, — and thereby to furnish in a thoroughly and scholarly manner and 
at a reasonable price the sources of Philippine History. 

" This publication is very highly to be commended, as, in the confused state of current information 
upon the conditions in our insular dependencies, evidence direct from unimpeachable sources is of 
the greatest importance. The American people realises its responsibility, but is at a loss to know 
what should be done, as so much uncertainty exists as to the conditions." — Paul S. Rkinsch, 
Professor of Political Science, University of Wisconsin.
