THE DIAL [Jan.l, 




atlantu $lontl)lj>, 1900 



MESSRS. HOUQHTON, MIPPLIN & COMPANY take pleasure in announcing to the many friends of 
lfl THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY that during the last year the growth of public interest in the magazine has 
been greater than at any time in its long history. The present subscription list is the largest on record, 
and the magazine is reaching month after month hundreds of new readers in every State in the Union. 
BELOW ARE GIVEN A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR 1900. 



THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF W. J. STILLMAN 

Mr. Stillmau's career as artist, editor, and newspaper correspondent in various foreign countries has brought 
him into touch with many of the most striking personages and events of the last fifty years. The early papers 
of the series give singularly interesting characterizations of Dr. Nott, the famous President of Union College, 
of Ruskin, Turner, and other English and American artists, of Kossuth, whom Mr. Stillman served as secret 
agent, of Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Agassiz, and other members of the Adirondack Club. 

THE RACE PROBLEM IN THE SOUTH 

By WALTER H. PAGE 
I. The White Man and the Negro. A social study, explaining the relations of the races to each other, 

as modified in a generation of freedom. 
II. The Race Problem and Education. A study of the methods of elevating the negro and the neglected 

white man in the South. 

III. Politics in the South. The practical disfranchisement of the negro and the gentler methods of per- 
petuating it; the creed of white rule and the probable future of the negro in politics. 

JOHN FISKE 

During 1900 THE ATLANTIC will present several papers from Mr. Fiske, among which will be one upon 
The African Slave Trade in the Fifties, and another upon The Life and Work of Huxley. 

ZITKALA-SA (Red Bird) 

Zitkala-Sa, a young Indian girl of the Yankton Sioux Tribe of Dakota Indians, who received her education 
in the East, has written 
Impressions of an Indian Childhood. These unique and genuine records of the mind of an Indian child 

are told precisely in her own words. 

The School Days of an Indian Girl, will describe her experiences as a pupil in the Government Schools. 
An Indian Teacher Among Indians, throws a good deal of light upon the vexed problem of Indian education. 

FOREIGN LETTERS 

One of the distinctive features of THE ATLANTIC for 1900 will be the appearance at regular intervals of 
Letters from England, France, and Germany. The first letter in the series will be a Review of England 
in 1899, by II. BRIMLEY JOHNSON, in the January Atlantic. Recent Social and Industrial Changes in 
Germany will be commented upon in March by W. C. DREHER; and ALVAN F. SANBORN will write in the 
early summer a letter entitled France Before the Exposition. 

The January Atlantic 

CONTAINS: 

The opening instalment of THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF W. J. STILLMAN. 
The first of Zitkala-Sa's Papers, IMPRESSIONS OF AN INDIAN CHILDHOOD. 

REFORM IN THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION. By WILLIAM DEWITT HYDE.

THEATRICAL COMMERCIALISM AND 
DRAMA TIC LITERA TURE. 

With the best will in the world, it is diffi- 
cult to take a hopeful view of the prospects of 
the art theatrical in the United States. That 
the play, rightly considered, may be reckoned 
among the most important of educative influ- 
ences, is a proposition to which no student of 
the history of culture will refuse his assent. 
It has been so in the past, it is so in some parts 
of the world at the present day, it may become 
so in the future even for those countries in 
which the most benighted and degrading con- 
ditions now obtain. As a school of manners, 
of propriety in speech, of historical portrayal, 
and of ethical ideal, its capabilities are as great 
as they ever were ; that these things should 
have been renounced, and that the art which 
might stand for them should be content to 
wallow in the slough of its present vulgarity 
and depravity as for the most part it un- 
doubtedly does wallow in the United States 
is one of the most saddening of facts. We are 
not, however, content to dismiss the fact with 
Mr. Henry Fuller's airy assumption that 
America as a nation is incapable of artistic 
endeavor ; we believe, rather, that a people 
having the English language and Shakespeare 
for its inheritance is better furnished than any 
other with the fundamentals of dramatic art, 
and that the present degradation of our stage 
is remediable, although not without such reso- 
luteness of effort as has not thus far been ap- 
plied to the task. 

It has been a favorite theory with moralists 
that as our civilization became more settled its 
feverish commercialism would subside, that the 
class of those having enough leisure to take 
thought for the cultural aspects of life would 
grow ever larger, and that the demand for 
mere distraction and entertainment natural 
enough in a population where nervous energy 
is exhausted in the struggle for wealth 
would gradually give place to a demand for 
edification. This theory has not as yet been 
borne out by the event. As far as a leisure 
class has differentiated itself in our society, 
it affords a conspicuous example of the inju- 
dicious use of its freedom. It exalts athletics 
above art, it prefers horse-shows to literature, 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



and it dissipates its opportunities for culture 
in the pursuit of frivolous aims and worthless 
social ambitions. The still larger class of those 
whose circumstances are such as to admit of a 
considerable degree of relaxation from the 
cares of business does not avail itself of the 
freedom it might so easily enjoy ; so far from 
aiming at the old ideal of plain living and high 
thinking, it seeks rather to achieve greater 
luxury in its living, although at the cost of the 
lowering of its thinking to a plane upon which 
there is no room for serious literature, or music, 
or the dramatic presentation of the deeper 
workings of the human soul. 

A comparison between America and Europe, 
as respects the current production of dramatic 
literature intended for actual performance, 
offers results which reflect upon us a striking 
national discredit. In Germany, the two fore- 
most writers among those now living are writers 
for the stage. The two greatest of living Scan- 
dinavians are likewise dramatists. In France 
there is at least the poet of " Cyrano " to 
reckon with, besides the men who have passed 
away during the closing quarter of the century. 
Italy offers one contemporary name of much 
significance, and the like statement is true of 
Spain and of Belgium. Even England has her 
present-day group of highly respectable play- 
wrights, men of serious purpose and substan- 
tial performance, if not exactly writers of 
genius. The works of all the men here men- 
tioned belong distinctly to the literatures of 
their respective countries, and in some cases 
they constitute the best literature that is now 
being produced in those countries. Has Amer- 
ica anything of the sort to show ? Well, we 
have Mr. Bronson Howard, and Mr. Augustus 
Thomas, and Mr. Clyde Fitch. But who would 
think of reckoning the productions of these 
men among the noteworthy things of our mod- 
ern literature? The mere suggestion is an ab- 
surdity. We have poets and novelists and 
essayists fairly comparable with those of the 
European countries ; but of dramatic writers, 
in the European sense, we have not one, nor 
have we ever produced one. 

The reasons for our national poverty in the 
production of good dramatic literature are not 
difficult to point out, but the task lies outside 
of our present purpose, which is rather that of 
calling attention to a recent development of 
our theatrical life which cannot help casting a 
blight upon any possible upgrowth of this 
species of composition in the United States. 
A good deal has been said of recent years, 



chiefly in the newspapers, concerning the or- 
ganization of a " theatrical trust " for the pur- 
pose of controlling our playhouses, and of 
practically monopolizing the supply of our 
theatrical entertainment. In the opening num- 
ber of the new " International Monthly " there 
is an article by Mr. Norman Hapgood entitled 
"The Theatrical Syndicate," which presents 
the most circumstantial account of that organi- 
zation which has come to our attention. It is 
an article deserving of wide circulation and 
close attention, for it reveals a grave menace 
to the best interests of American play- writing 
and the American stage. 

About four years ago, it seems, half a dozen 
theatrical managers joined themselves together 
for the purpose of acquiring control of the 
leading actors and the leading theatres of the 
country. Within a few months the work of 
organization had become so effective that thirty- 
seven first-class theatres had been secured, and 
the cooperation enlisted of a large proportion 
of the best companies and individual actors. 
" The essence of the system, from that day to 
this, with constantly increasing scope and 
power, has been that the theatres take only 
such plays as the syndicate desires, on the 
dates which it desires, and receive in return 
an unbroken succession of companies, with 
none of the old-time idle weeks." To the actor, 
on the other hand, the system offers an un- 
broken succession of engagements in the most 
desirable places, so arranged as to secure the 
greatest economy in transportation. The con- 
trol thus gained was almost absolute, both in 
the large cities and in many of the smaller 
ones. " There is not even a barn free in Cleve- 
land," says Mr. Hapgood significantly. To 
the theatre owner the syndicate could say, and 
does say in substance : "If you do not do busi- 
ness with us, on our own terms, we will not let 
you have first-rate attractions. If you do, we 
will destroy your rival, or force him to the 
same terms. For the bookings we will take a 
share of the profits." It was inevitable that, 
having once acquired the needed initial head- 
way, the power of this combination should be- 
come almost irresistible, and that the desired 
play-houses should one by one succumb, until 
the present monopoly was constituted. 

Again, the power of such a combination to 
force the actor to terms was equally irresist- 
ible. The alternative became a precarious se- 
ries of bookings, largely in undesirable houses, 
and arranged along an expensive route. But 
for a time many actors held out against the 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



combination. Among these were Mr. Wil- 
son, Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Mansfield, Mr. Daly, 
and Mrs. Fiske. The most melancholy feature 
of Mr. Hapgood's article is the account of the 
weak fashion in which nearly all of these op- 
ponents of monopoly succumbed, one after 
another, to the combined threats and allure- 
ments of the system, and exchanged their 
sturdy-seeming independence for a supine ac- 
ceptance of the syndicate yoke. The death of 
Mr. Daly, who was the most dangerous foe of 
the syndicate, left Mrs. Fiske to oppose its 
aims almost single-handed. What this means 
is that " she may be able to play but a few 
weeks each season in America, or not at all." 
But she will have the respect and active sup- 
port of all true friends of the stage because she 
represents the most vital principle now at stake 
in her profession, a principle so important that, 
if it failed, the condition of theatrical art in 
America will become even more hopeless than 
it has ever been before. 

For concerning the malign influence of the 
syndicate upon our dramatic art there must be 
no delusion. Its predominance means com- 
mercialism, and nothing else. It means the 
same thing for the theatre that the most dis- 
reputable of our sensational newspapers mean 
for journalism. It means simply that all artistic 
considerations will be swept away in the mad 
purpose of coining money from the stage. But 
we do not need to theorize as to what it means. 
The last two years have brought the matter out 
of the region of theory into that of fact. Never 
before have we had so large a proportion of 
trivial, empty, and vulgar productions among 
the entertainments offered our public. Decency 
has never before been defied in so wanton and 
brutal a fashion. Intelligence has never be- 
fore been flouted by such a parade of what is 
inane and imbecile. Never in recent years has 
the outlook seemed so dark as it has been made 
by the conscienceless activity of this league of 
speculators, with their two-fold appeal, on the 
one hand to the greed of actors and managers, 
on the other to the least worthy, if not actually 
the lowest, instincts of the theatre-going public. 

Is there no remedy for this desperate condi- 
tion of affairs ? Mr. Hapgood seems to think 
that the syndicate will run its course and soon 
suffer disintegration. He anticipates having 
to relate, within a few years, the story of its 
decline and fall. But as long as actors and 
managers are money-makers first of all, the 
conditions will remain which make possible our 
present plight. It is not too much to assume 



that among our actors there will always be some 
who will elect to be artists as their primary 
aim, although the number of these is at present 
small. But theatrical management will con- 
tinue to be essentially commercial until the 
municipal theatre appears, or at least the thea- 
tre dedicated, either by endowment or by the 
disinterested activities of cultivated people, to 
higher aims than those comprised in the idea of 
commercial success. When such theatres come, 
as we believe they will in the near future, we 
may hope for a fair beginning of the educative 
work, necessarily slow at best, whereby in the 
next generation there shall be provided a public 
seeking from the stage something more than 
diversion, and whereby men of literary talent 
may be encouraged to write plays, as they now 
write poems and novels, with the reasonable 
certainty of reward for meritorious work. We 
have no dramatic literature at present, for the 
simple reason that a play possessing literary 
quality has practically no chance of reaching 
the public at all. The avenues of approach are 
so guarded by sordid and uncultivated interest* 
that it would be wasted effort to seek them 
with any work of high character. The pass- 
words are now sensationalism and vulgarity 
rather than literary art or idealism of any sort. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



WORDSWORTH AND MR. MARKHAM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Among the recent notices of Mr. Markham's poem 
on The Man with the Hoe," I have found that in THE 
DIAL somewhat disturbing. Perhaps the reviewer had 
not Mr. Markham so much in view as some of the lat- 
ter's commentators; but the bald assertion that men 
make themselves instead of being moulded from with- 
out is too summary, and raises the question whether 
the necessary qualifications are not of such burning im- 
portance that they cannot be ignored in the references 
of a leader of thought without mischief being done. 

The issue is not so easily downed. Animal content 
so runs the argument of the quotation from Stevenson 
is better than whining, or animal discontent; animal 
content cannot change to spiritual without passing 
through the stage of animal discontent (true enough, 
possibly); animal discontent is understood to be very 
disagreeable indeed; therefore, let animal content re- 
main as it is, and spiritual content remain confined to 
the few that possess it: t. e., let progression stop. 

Difficulties arise here. How shall the bodily con- 
tented be classified as animals, or men ? If they are 
only a clever sort of animals at present, need we be so 
very much concerned at such wrenching of animal sen- 
sibilities for a few generations as is necessary for that 
humanization which shall last through countless ages ? 
But if men, what does all this mean ?

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



" Thou may'st not rest in any lovely thing, 

Thou, who wert formed to seek and to aspire ; 
For no fulfilment of thy dreams can bring 
The answer to thy measureless desire." 

" Whether we be young or old, 
Our destiny, our being's heart and home, 
Is with infinitude, and only there ; 
With hope it is, hope that can never die, 
Effort, and expectation, and desire, 
And something evermore about to be." 
" Not a having and a resting, but a growing and a becoming." 
In the interest of fair play, let us acknowledge that 
Mr. Markbam is in good company. It will be found 
interesting to compare portions of the eighth and ninth 
books of Wordsworth's " Excursion." I make a few 
pertinent quotations. After a personal description 
which anticipates Mr. Markham's, the Solitary says: 
" This torpor is no pitiable work 
Of modern ingenuity : no town 
Nor crowded city can be taxed with aught 
Of sottish vice or desperate breach of law 
To which (and who can tell where or how soon?) 
He may be roused. This Boy the fields produce ; 
His spade and hoe, mattock and glittering scythe, 
The carter's whip that on his shoulder rests 
In air high-towering, with a boorish pomp, 
The sceptre of his sway ; his country's name, 
Her equal rights, her churches and her schools 
What have they done for him ? And, let me ask, 
For tens of thousands uninformed as he ? 
In brief, what liberty of mind is here ?" 

And the Wanderer replies, in part: 
"To every Form of being is assigned 
An active principle. . . . 
This is the freedom of the universe ; 
Unfolded still the more, more visible, 
The more we know ; and yet is reverenced least, 
And least respected in the human Mind, 
Its most apparent home. The food of hope 
Is meditated action ; robbed of this 
Her whole support, she languishes and dies. 
We perish also ; for we live by hope 
And by desire ; we see by the glad light 
And breathe the sweet air of futurity ; 
And so we live, or else we have no life." 

" No one takes delight 
In this oppression ; none are proud of it ; 
It bears no sounding name, nor ever bore ; 
A standing grievance, an indigenous vice 
Of every country under heaven." 

If Wordsworth and Mr. Markham really beg the 
whole question, culture is a failure, educational work 
(among the non-elect) quixotic, and, among other mo- 
mentous consequences, literary journals cannot increase 
their subscription lists faster than the ratio of increase 
of population among the aristocracy of mind. More: 
republican imperialism, inflated currency, and the like, 
should in consistency be suffered to flourish as green 
bay trees; for these exist largely by sufferance of the 
ale-and-tobacco consuming class, and to dower it with 
political or other wisdom means also to inflict the ca- 
pacity and inclination for whining which will never do.

Denver, Col., Dec. SO, 1899. 

HAPGOOD'S LIFE OF LINCOLN. 

(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Will you permit one who has read Mr. Hapgood's 
" Abraham Lincoln, The Man of the People " with great 
interest and approval to comment on the notice of that 
book in your issue of Nov. 16. The reviewer expresses 



himself moderately and courteously, but has evidently 
found the book deficient in emphasis of the ideal ele 
ment in Lincoln's character. Now, it has seemed to 
others that one of the special attractions of the book is 
that Mr. Hapgood, while quite as willing to look facts in 
the eye as Herndon, has yet a feeling for the greatness 
and grandeur of the man which Herndou lacked, or at 
least failed to express in his biography of Lincoln. Mr. 
Hapgood dwells much upon Lincoln's humble origin and 
his close sympathy with the people; and he rightly 
makes the power of comprehending the people an impor- 
tant element of the President's greatness. This power 
Lincoln shared with innumerable successful politicians. 
But what in the latter was mere cleverness, in Lincoln 
was genius. There are hundreds of thousands of " men 
of the people." But Lincoln was a great " man of the 
people." It is hard to understand how anybody can 
read Mr. Hapgood's book through without feeling that 
it is pervaded by a noble seriousness, and that it ends 
in a note that is at once lofty and genuine.

MORE PAPYRI. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I call the attention of your readers to the vol- 
ume of the " Grace-Roman Branch " of our Egypt 
Exploration Fund, now nearly ready for subscribers? 
Among its contents are St. John I. and XX., from one 
to two hundred years older than any known text; por- 
tions of St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians; 
much of an unknown play by Menander; also a treatise 
on metre and on the twenty-first Book of the Iliad; 
portions of a lost epic poem, of a comedy, history, ora- 
tions, etc. ; of Euripides, Plato, Xenophon, etc., etc. A 
list of victors in the Olympian games, the most com- 
plete for any given period so far known, and evidence 
bearing upon the date of the birth of Christ, are among 
the treasures of such a book. But a most captivating 
feature is the verbal picture of society and life during 
the earliest centuries of our era. The social and busi- 
ness correspondence will interest every reader. All 
subscribers or donors of not less than five dollars will 
receive the annual volume, also the Archaeological Re- 
port and Annual Report. The society depends abso- 
lutely upon subscriptions for support. I donate my 
services. Circulars furnished. WM. C. WINSLOW

A LONG DESIRE. 



I put my money where 't would be secure ; 

And safe it is: from me it is, I'm sure. 

I had a friend that suited well, I said; 

He lives abroad now, ah, how long since dead ! 

I loved a woman: sweet and fair she seemed, 

And true, as heaven has made or love has dreamed. 

Come here, my books These were my earliest life ; 
These to the end shall be wealth, friends, and wife. 
Whether the wrong was mine or theirs, let be: 
'T is long gone by, nay, mine then, all in me. 
But grant me these: these spare, while age assaults: 
Dante and Shakespeare have endured my faults.

A BUSSIAX REVOLTJTIOXIST.* 

It is easy to understand how a man who has 
passed his most impressionable years under an 
extremely harsh and extremely arbitrary gov- 
ernment should be predisposed, when the time 
came for adopting a definite political creed, to 
favor the views of that school of political 
thought (if one may so term it) which preaches 
the abolition of all government and all govern- 
ors whatsoever. Thus, a youth bred in the 
doleful seclusion of Dotheboys Hall, under the 
knout of Mr. Squeers and the brimstone-and- 
treacle despotism of his terrible spouse, might 
likewise find nothing especially startling or 
preposterous in a formal proposal for the doing 
away with all schools and the summary execu- 
tion of all schoolmasters. On the other hand, 
people who have passed through a long and san- 
guinary period of mob-rule will commonly not 
only warmly agree with M. Taine that " how- 
ever bad a particular government may be, there 
is something still worse, namely, the suppres- 
sion of all government," but will be prepared to 
welcome the iron rule of some despotic saviour 
of society as the realization of the ideal polity. 
In short, the Russia of Nicholas I. bred Nihil- 
ists as naturally and inevitably as the Paris of 
Hebert and Robespierre bred absolutists. 

The vastly interesting portion of Prince 
Kropotkin's memoir which tells the story of his 
life in Russia (embracing about three-fourths 
of the volume) renders his conversion to an- 
archism sufficiently intelligible. Just why his 
anarchism was not subsequently tempered 
through his long sojourn in free and well gov- 
erned countries like England and Switzerland, 
and just why he should have gone on dreaming 
the dreams of Anacharsis Clootz in a British 
and a Swiss atmosphere of common-sense, does 
not appear, and we shall not try to explain. 
There is a certain unconscious humor in Kro- 
potkin's account of his discouraging encounters, 
as a propagandist, with that same British 
common-sense which persisted in asking embar- 
rassing questions as to practical ways and means, 
and in forcing discussion out of the region of 
flattering generalities and air-castle building 
into the region of hard facts and feasible ex- 
pedients. " General principles," he found, 
"deeply interest the Latin workers." The

British workman bent his mind to the effort to 
figure how this or that flattering scheme of so- 
cial or economic reconstruction would be likely 
to work in practice. 

" ' Well, Kropdtkin, suppose that to-morrow we were 
to take possession of the docks of our town. What 'a your 
idea about how to manage them ? ' would be asked, for 
instance, as soon as we had sat down in a workingman's 
parlor. Or, We do n't like the idea of state manage- 
ment of railways, and the present management by com- 
panies is organized robbery. But suppose the workers 
own all the railways. How could the working of them 
be organized ? ' " 

Kropotkin's account of how his father, dur- 
ing the Turkish compaign of 1828, won the 
cross of Saint Anne " for gallantry " is most 
amusing, and explains in a line the status of 
the Russian serf. 

" The officers of the general staff were lodged in a 
Turkish village, when it took fire. In a moment the 
houses were enveloped in flames, and in one of them a 
child had been left behind. Its mother uttered despair- 
ing cries. Thereupon, Frol (a faithful serf), who always 
accompanied his master, rushed into the flames and 
saved the child. The chief commander, who saw the 
act, at once gave father the cross for gallantry. ' But, 
father,' we exclaimed, ' it was Frol who saved the child! ' 
What of that ? ' he replied, in the most naive way. 
Was he not my man ? It is all the same.' " 

Wealth, in the time of Kropotkin's father, 
was measured in Russia by the number of 
" souls " a landed proprietor owned. " Souls " 
meant male serfs (women did not count), and 
the elder Kropotkin, as the owner of some 
twelve hundred " souls," was accounted a rich 
man. He was, as things went then, a humane 
master decidedly " not among the worst of 
landowners." What, in this relation, one of 
these " worst of landowners " may have been 
can be surmised from the author's reminiscence 
of his childhood, in which, he says, he seeks to 
recall the conditions of serfdom by telling, not 
what he heard of, but what he saw. 

" A landowner once made the remark to another, 
< Why is it that the number of souls on your estate in- 
creases so slowly? You probably do not look after their 
marriages.' A few days later the general returned to 
his estate. He had a list of all the inhabitants brought 
him, and picked out from it the names of the boys who 
had attained the age of eighteen, and the girls just past 
sixteen, these are the legal ages for marriage in Rus- 
sia. Then he wrote, ' John to marry Anna, Paul to 
marry Parashka,' and so on with five couples. ' The 
five weddings,' he added, must take place in ten days, 
the next Sunday but one.' A general cry of despair 
rose from the village. Women, young and old, wept 
in every house. Anna had hoped to marry Gregory; 
Paul's parents had already had a talk with the Fedo- 
toffs about their girl, who would soon be of age. . . . 
Dozens of peasants came to see the landowner; peasant 
women stood in groups at the back entrance of the es- 
tate, with pieces of fine linen for the landowner's spouse

to secure her intervention. All in vain. The master 
had said that the weddings should take place at such a 
date, and so it must be. At the appointed time, the 
nuptial processions, in this case more like burial pro- 
cessions, went to the church. The women cried out 
with loud voices, as they are wont to cry during buri- 
als. . . . Half an hour later, the small bells of the 
nuptial processions resounded at the gate of the man- 
sion. The five couples alighted from the cars, crossed 
the yard, and entered the hall. The landlord received 
them, offering them glasses of wine, while the parents, 
standing behind the crying daughters, ordered them to 
bow to the earth before their lord." 

The barbarous social system which such 
stories but faintly serve to illustrate could not 
long withstand the rising tide of popular en- 
lightenment. A sense of the dignity of hu- 
manity, long latent in Russia, was quickened 
into lively resentment of the daily spectacle of 
human beings held and driven as cattle, before 
the middle of the century. The French popular 
movements of 1789 and 1830 were not without 
a responsive echo in the upper strata of Rus- 
sian society ; even the dull ear of the Russian 
peasant caught the sound of the explosion of 
1848. The years 1857-60 were years of rich 
and comparatively general intellectual growth. 
The ideas that permeate the pages of Turgue- 
nieff, Tolstoy, Herzen, Bakunin, Dostoevsky, 
and that before had been canvassed with bated 
breath in the secrecy of friendly meetings, be- 
gan now to leak out in the press and to find 
advocacy in places where such ideas were as 
sparks among tinder. The abolition of serfdom 
became the question of the hour. Alexander 
II., not at heart averse to the measure, saw its 
necessity, and in 1856 spoke to the reactionary 
nobility of Moscow the memorable words (bor- 
rowed perhaps from Herzen): " It is better, 
gentlemen, that it should come from above 
than to wait till it comes from beneath." The 
law was passed in 1861. What the abolition 
of serfdom meant to the peasant is prettily 
illustrated by the author in the following story. 
Eleven years after the passage of the law he 
visited an estate of his father's, and found a 
middle-aged man, an ex-serf, "sitting on a 
small eminence outside the village and reading 
a book of psalms." 

" He was reading now a psalm of which each verse 
began with the word ' rejoice.' ' What are you read- 
ing? ' he was asked. ' Well, father, I will tell you,' 
was his reply. Fourteen years ago the old prince came 
here. It was in the winter. I had just returned home, 
almost frozen. A snow-storm was raging. I had 
scarcely begun undressing, when we heard a knock at 
the window : it was the elder, who was shouting, ' Go to 
the prince ! He wants you ! ' We all my wife and 
our children were thunderstruck. What can he 
want of you ? ' my wife cried in alarm. I signed my- 



self with the cross and went; the snowstorm almost 
blinded me as I crossed the bridge. Well, it ended all 
right. The old prince was taking his afternoon nap, 
and when he woke up he asked me if I knew plaster- 
ing work, and only told me, ' Come to-morrow to repair 
the plaster in that room.' So I went home quite happy, 
and when I got to the bridge I found my wife standing 
there. What has happened, Savelich ? ' she cried. 
Well,' I said, ' no harm; he only asked me to make some 
repairs.' That, father, was under the old prince. And 
now, the young prince came here the other day. I went 
to see him, and found him in the garden, at the tea- 
table, in the shadow of the house; you, father, sat with 
him, and the elder of the canton, with his mayor's chain 
upon his breast. Will you have tea, Savelich ? ' he 
asks me. ' Take a chair.' Petr Grigdrieff,' he says 
that to the old one, ' give us one more chair.' And 
Petr you know what a terror he was for us when he 
was the manager for the old prince brought the chair, 
and we all sat round the tea-table, talking, and he 
poured out tea for all of us. Well, now, father, the 
evening is so beautiful, the balm comes from the prairies, 
and I sit and read ' Rejoice ! Rejoice ! ' " 

Herzen was right, says Kropotkin, when, 
two years after the emancipation of the serfs, 
while the emancipator was drowning the Polish 
insurrection in blood, he wrote : " Alexander 
Nikolaevich, why did you not die on that day ? 
Your name would have been transmitted in 
history as that of a hero." For the tragic fate 
of Alexander II., Kropotkin expresses no sor- 
row. From the beginning of 1862, he thinks, 
the ill-starred Tsar commenced to show himself 
capable of reviving the worst practices of his 
father's reign. 

" To me, who had the chance of witnessing the first 
reactionary steps of Alexander II., and his gradual de- 
terioration, who had caught a glimpse of his complex 
personality that of a born autocrat, whose violence 
was but partially mitigated by education, of a man pos- 
sessed of military gallantry, but devoid of the courage 
of the statesman, of a man of strong passions and weak 
will, it seemed that the tragedy developed with the 
unavoidable fatality of one of Shakespeare's dramas." 

Kropotkin's story is a singularly rich, diver- 
sified, and romantic one, and it is attractively 
told. Nothing more interesting in its way has 
ever been written than the chapters relating his 
prison life and his dramatic escape. The book 
abounds in instructive pictures of Russian life 
and character, done with unconscious art. 
From every page shines the bright humanity, 
the sincere conviction, the simple earnestness, 
the sweet unselfishness of a character which we 
must admire, however much we shrink from 
the creed it stands for. And how few of us 
have taken the trouble to look into that creed, 
and to try to discover what there is in it that 
can possibly recommend it to a good and an 
intelligent man ! Let those who would appre- 
ciate the distinction between the reasoned or

SOME NEW CONTRIBUTIONS TO QUAKER 
HISTORY. * 

President Isaac Sharpless' first volume, " A 
Quaker Experiment in Government," when 
published last year, was recognized by com- 
petent authorities as a distinct contribution to 
historical knowledge. The same recognition 
will be extended to his new volume, " The 
Quakers in the Revolution." Together, the 
two volumes present a clear outline of what 
may be called the political history of the 
Quakers in Pennsylvania from the founding of 
the colony to the close of the Revolutionary 
war, and, in one respect, to a still later time. 
Their value lies principally in the fact that 
their author, instead of following the old beaten 
path, merely using over again hackneyed 
authorities, opens up new and valuable sources 
of information. These sources are clearly de- 
scribed in the preface to Volume I. 

" The purpose of the book is to include, with other 
sources of information, the contemporary Quaker view. 
This has been gained by a careful examination of Meet- 
ing Records and private letters of the times, and a 
fairly intimate personal acquaintance with many who 
probably represent, in this generation, in their mental 
and moral characteristics, the Quaker Governing Class 
of the first century of the Province." 

The number of extracts from records and 
letters is unusual in historical writings, but 
their presence, while they constantly break 
the current of the narrative, will not be regret- 
ted by historical scholars. They are clearly 
justified by the facts that they have not, as a 
body, been published before, and that the author 
has not a work of the traditional type before 
him, and by their intrinsic interest and value. 

While both volumes are so good, it may 
seem invidious to discriminate between them ; 
however, we must confess to finding the first 
one the more interesting and informing. For

one thing, it contains a general view of the 
ecclesiastical machinery of the Quakers, as 
well as of the way in which they used it to 
carry on their peculiar work. On these points 
the general reader is much less well informed 
than he is on the Quaker doctrines or prin- 
ciples, and the general tenor of Quaker history. 
In Chapter III. Mr. Sharpless describes the 
main features of the organization, produced in 
England and reproduced in Pennsylvania, 
which was " due to the good sense and practical 
genius of George Fox, and was probably worked 
out during his cruel imprisonment of nearly 
three years in Lancaster and Scarboro jails." 
The Yearly Meeting, which was the highest 
organ in the system, was at first a representa- 
tive body, but " ultimately became an assembly 
of all members of the society, the men and 
women meeting together as different bodies." 
To the Yearly Meeting the Quarterly Meet- 
ings reported, and were in turn divided into 
Monthly Meetings, the real working bodies of 
the organization in matters relating to the in- 
dividual members. Next and last came the 
Preparative Meetings. There was also the 
Meeting for Sufferings, the name of which 
suggests its function, lying apparently outside 
of the original system. The general functions 
of the real working bodies are thus described : 
" The Monthly Meeting undertook to see that justice 
was done between man and man, that disputes were 
settled, that the poor were supported, that delinquents, 
whether as to the Society's own rules or those of the 
State, were reformed, or, if reformation seemed im- 
possible, were ' disowned ' by the Society, that appli- 
cants for membership were tested, and finally, if satis- 
factory, received ; that all the children were educated, 
that certificates of good standing were granted to mem- 
bers changing their abodes, that marriages and burials 
were simply and properly performed, and that records 
were fully and accurately kept." 

We are told further that " the business mat- 
ters of Friends were looked into, where any 
possibility of danger existed," since it "was 
felt that the body was responsible for the con- 
duct of each individual." Advice was first 
offered by " concerned friends," and if this did 
not prove acceptable, " the power of the meet- 
ing was invoked, and only after months of 
earnest labor in the case of a refractory mem- 
ber was ' disownment ' resorted to." " The ad- 
vice of the higher meetings finally crystallized 
into a requirement for each Monthly Meeting 
to answer three times a year, plainly and hon- 
estly, the query, ' Are Friends punctual in 
their promises and just in the payment of their 
debts ? ' ' When we remember the breadth of 
this jurisdiction, the spirit in which it was ad-

ministered, the character of the people, and 
the thoroughness of the regimen, we are not 
surprised to find President Sharpless saying: 
" Had all the inhabitants been Friends and amenable 
to their discipline, very little civil government would 
have been needed in internal affairs. The work of the 
Legislature might have been devoted mainly to ques- 
tions involving titles, etc., to property, and courts of 
law would have been shorn of nearly all their criminal 
and much of their civil business, while sheriffs and 
policemen, jails and punishments, might almost have 
been omitted as unnecessary. Indeed, this was prac- 
tically the case for some decades in Pennsylvania in 
country districts where the Quaker element constituted 
nearly the whole population." 

We should have been glad if the author had 
gone into more detail relative to the territorial 
bases or areas of the several Meetings in Penn- 
sylvania. He tells us that the Philadelphia 
Yearly Meeting, which dates back to 1681, 
embraced monthly meetings on both sides of 
the Delaware, in New Jersey, Delaware, and 
Pennsylvania, and later some in Maryland. 

If any reader infers from what we have 
written that these volumes are mainly didactic, 
constituting an exposition of the Quaker sys- 
tem, we hasten to reassure him : they rather 
deal, for the most part, with the livest ques- 
tions of the time. Moreover, when their time 
limits are recalled, it will be seen that such 
questions were of constant occurrence. Besides 
those growing out of planting the Quaker body 
in Pennsylvania, and the later ones of a strictly 
internal or domestic sort, there were what may 
be called the foreign relations of the body 
relations to the Indians and to the non-Quaker 
populations that flowed into the Province ; rela- 
tions to neighboring colonies and to the home 
government down to the close of the Colonial 
period, and finally the relations to the govern- 
ment of Pennsylvania itself after it passed 
wholly out of their hands, and to the revolu- 
tionary government when that came to be con- 
stituted. In some form or other, this question 
pressed almost constantly for an answer : " How 
shall the Quaker live in a world of which, in 
some important sense, he is not, and proclaims 
himself not to be, a part ? " Or, changing the 
form of question, " How shall he adjust himself 
to the society that is about him in a manner 
that is even comfortable or even endurable, and 
still remain a Quaker?" It was a difficult 
adjustment to effect ; there are few more diffi- 
cult ones of the kind, all things considered, in 
history. It cannot be claimed that the body as 
a whole solved the problem ; it is easy to dis- 
cover and to parade their inconsistencies ; but 
it must be admitted that, when all is taken into 



the account, their success was something be- 
yond reasonable expectation. A large majority 
of them, in the most trying times, bore a noble 
and a costly testimony to what they held to be 
the truth. Naturally, they resorted to some 
practical casuistry, but fortunately they pro- 
duced no casuistical system, while the Quaker 
conscience retained its simple honesty. 

The most trying period that the Pennsyl- 
vania Quakers passed through was the Ameri- 
can Revolution, which Mr. Sharpless treats in 
his second volume. To a great extent, the 
Revolution involved principles that they held 
most dear ; but it was rebellion against legally 
constituted authority, it was war, and for both 
reasons, if there be not only one, they could 
not give it aid or comfort. Touching the trend 
of their sympathies, the author writes : 

" It is impossible to give a definite answer, but there 
are several guides on which something of a judgment 
may be based. About 400, perhaps, actively espoused 
the American side by joining the army, accepting posi- 
tions under the Revolutionary government, or taking an 
affirmation of allegience to it, and lost their birthright 
among Friends as a result. Perhaps a score in a similar 
way openly espoused the British cause, and also were 
disowned by their brethren. These members very likely 
represented two portions of silent sympathizers. The 
official position was one of neutrality, but individually 
the Friends could hardly be neutral. It seems almost 
certain that the men of property and social standing in 
Philadelphia, the Virginia exiles and their close asso- 
ciates, like the wealthy merchants of New York and 
Boston, were Loyalists, though in their case passively 
so. ... Many of the country Friends were probably 
American in their sympathies. It is very difficult to 
show this in history, and only by slight allusions here 
and there is the idea gained. . . . There were, there- 
fore, a few radical Tories, a much larger number of 
radical friends of the Revolution, and the rest were 
quiet sympathizers with one or the other party. In this 
diversity all the moderate men who were really desirous 
to be faithful to the traditional beliefs of their fathers 
could unite on a platform of perfect neutrality of action 
for conscience' sake." 

If the Quakers in Pennsylvania really num- 
bered 40,000 souls in 1760, it seems almost 
incredible that so few should have overtly taken 
sides with one party or the other, but Mr. 
Sharpless' opinion is entitled to great respect. 
It will be remembered that the body gave to the 
country two such soldiers as Mifflin and Greene, 
and such a statesman as John Dickinson. 

The last chapter is a consise but luminous 
account of the long war that the Quakers waged 
against slavery, until, by force of moral sua- 
sion, they rooted it out of their own community, 
and did much to indoctrinate the nation with 
anti-slavery principles. There is no nobler 
chapter in their history.

All in all, the story of Pennsylvania is the 
most pathetic of all of the English colonial 
stories. There is Penn's own personal story. 
" In one sense," says our author, " a sadder life 
than his we seldom know. His letters again 
and again, sometimes pathetic, sometimes indig- 
nant, portray the keen disappointment of an 
earnest, conscientious, and sensitive soul." He 
quotes the familiar lamentation : 

"O Pennsylvania, what hast thou cost me! About 
30,000 more than I ever got by it, two hazardous and 
most fatiguing voyages, my straits and slavery here [in 
London], and my child's soul, almost." 

But a still broader view may be taken of the 
matter. Great as the colony became, what a 
contrast the beginning and the end of the " Holy 
Experiment " presents ! For instance, if Penn 
could have foreseen the day when a governor 
under his charter, and that governor his own 
grandson, would offer prizes for Indian scalps, 
male or female, his heart might well have burst. 
The commonwealth bears two lessons on its 
face ; one to the practical time-server, desti- 
tute of all idealism, the other to the utopist, 
equally destitute of common sense. 

Miss Hazard's book moves in a much smaller 
circle than Mr. Sharpless' two volumes. Of 
its kind, however, it is a book of even greater 
interest. Passing by the chapter devoted to 
Quaker beginnings in Rhode Island, we have 
a series of chapters dealing almost wholly with 
the organization and economy of the Quakers 
of Narragansett Bay. It is distinctly an inte- 
rior study of church history. The writer brings 
a small section of a large subject under her 
microscope, revealing the minutest facts of 
ecclesiastical life. Much of the matter is curi- 
ous in the extreme. One not familiar with 
similar facts will here see with surprise, if not 
with astonishment, the ceaseless vigilance with 
which the organization regarded the lives and 
conduct of its members. While this supervision 
was exercised in the name of good morals and 
sound teaching, it often embraced matters that 
free communities generally relegate to the 
sphere of individual action. If any reader is 
in quest of facts with which to prove that the 
Quakers were essentially destitute of the sense 
of humor, we recommend him to read Miss Haz- 
ard's book. For instance, after 1758 all mar- 
riages not among Friends were forbidden by 
the Society, and, as far as possible, the rule was 
strictly enforced. When a brother disobeyed 
the law, and married outside of the body, he 
was required to make " acknowledgement " and 



to " condemn " his action, or be " disowned " in 
the end ; but this does not appear in any way 
to have interfered with his married life. Miss 
Hazard quotes several such acknowledgements, 
and among others the following, which as she 
says, " makes one wonder what kind of a woman 
this man's wife was." 

" I do hereby acknowledge that I have wilfully and 
knowingly transgressed the good Order and Rules of 
the Society in proceeding in marriage with a woman not 
of the Society nor according to the Method allowed of 
amongst Friends for which Transgression I am heartily 
sorry and do desire Friends to forgive and pass by and 
hope that I shall by the Lord's assistance be preserved 
not only from Transgression of so willful a crime but 
also of all others." 

It must indeed have been "rather a bitter 
thing " for a man to present to the meeting 
such a paper as this, but perhaps it was looked 
upon more as a matter of form than anything 
else. 

Still Miss Hazard is gracious enough to jus- 
tify this great care for the proper solemnization 
of marriage, on the ground that the looseness 
of the times required it. She says the day of 
marrying in shifts was not long past, and quotes 
two instances of this curious custom found in 
the South Kingstown Records. One of these was 
in 1719, when the man took the woman in mar- 
riage " after she had gone four times across the 
highway in only her shift and hair-lace and no 
other clothing." In the other case, 1724, " the 
woman had her shift and hair-lace and no other 
clothing on that I see," remarked the justice 
who performed the ceremony. These weddings 
were in the months of February and December. 
But, after all, most usages have some reason 
behind them, and this was the reason in the 
present case : " For the object of the curious 
ceremony was the evasion of debt. If the wife 
brought her husband nothing, she could not 
even bring her debts, and he was free from 
paying them, which he would otherwise have 
to do." 

Few religious bodies of equal intelligence and 
character present more curious contradictions 
and anomalies than the Quakers. The doctrine 
of the Inner Light, carried to the length to which 
they first went, is absolutely irreconcilable 
with all organization and formalism in the re- 
ligious sphere. The inspired prophet is supe- 
rior to law, custom, and authority. He has 
no need of rule or canon, bishop or church, 
forms or ceremonies. Fox and his co-laborers 
denounced all such things in the severest terms. 
Of course the end, if it had been reached, would 
have been fatal to all religious organization,

control, and permanence. But what was the 
result ? First, an efficient system of ecclesias- 
tical organization, that, as the reader of these 
books will see, obtruded itself into matters that 
are essentially personal and private, though 
without the use of other than moral force ; and 
secondly, a formalism that so distinctly marked 
the Quaker in attire, speech, and manners that 
he was known to be a Quaker wherever he went. 
Fox did show his good sense and practical 
genius in setting up this organization, thus 
proving that he was something very different 
from the ignorant fanatic that most men took 
him to be ; but he did not show either logical 
consistency or fidelity to his great principle. 
As is well known, the system was not im- 
posed upon the body without much resistance 
on the part of other " prophets " who claimed 
the same right to have " openings " and " to 
bring men off " that Fox had so freely asserted 
for himself. It was indeed fortunate that Fox 
was not a logical man, for had it not been for the 
system of " meetings " that he devised, to take 
the place of churches, synods, assemblies, and 
the like, it seems plain that the Quakers would 
have accomplished little in the long run, and 
would even have come to an early end. We 
know of no proof more convincing than that 
furnished by the history of the Quakers of the 
ancient saying, " If you drive out nature with 
a fork, she will return again."

PROBLEMS OF COLONIAL, GOVERNMENT.* 



Mr. Alleyne Ireland, known through his 
articles in recent magazines on various prob- 
lems of colonial government, now appears with 
a more systematic treatise under the title of 
" Tropical Colonization." It is perhaps need- 
less to say that the subject is treated in its 
practical economic and political bearings, and 
not in its ethical relations : a treatment for 
which the author has the qualification of sev- 
eral years' experience in the British colonies 
and dependencies in various parts of the world. 
He modestly calls his work " an introduction 
to the study of the subject." After a lucid 
explanation of the experiments and practice of 
government of colonial possessions by the four 
great colonizing nations, England, France, 
Spain, and Holland, he proceeds to the discus-

sion of trade and the labor problem. Valuable 
original tables elucidate his statements. 

Two principal conclusions must be forced 
upon the student from this cool array of facts 
and figures. The first of these is that all col- 
onization which has resulted in the development 
of a stable liberal government, absolutely or 
partially independent of the mother country, 
has been in the Temperate Zones and under the 
control of the Anglo-Saxon race, guided and 
always influenced by the Anglo-Saxon system 
of political and social morality. The astonish- 
ing feature of the times is the curious notion 
which to-day permeates the English as well as 
the French and German mind, that in the pres- 
ent madness for territory these nations expect 
to see a development of their new tropical pos- 
sessions in Africa along these same lines and 
to reproduce the same vigorous growth in the 
Tropics which has characterized that of the 
Temperate Zones, and all this with full 
knowledge of the experience of the past. 

Four hundred years of tropical colonization 
controlled by these four great nations has re- 
sulted in the apparent necessity for policies of 
administration varying but slightly in auto- 
cratic character, as a governor is always ap- 
pointed by the home power, with more or less 
representation of the native races through 
suffrage. There has been no permanent col- 
onization of the white races in the Tropics, 
and the always limited and unstable charac- 
ter of this colonization has affected the possi- 
bility of the growth of an educated spirit and 
of any desire or attempt on the part of native 
races to secure any independence of gov- 
ernment. Sufficient representation in local 
administration has been granted to satisfy an 
indolent people of a low grade of intelligence 
and limited education, and the sordid com- 
mercial spirit has been the controlling influ- 
ence in the past, with its unspeakable outrages, 
and of the present, with its reforms, because 
of the growth among the people of the home 
government of the feeling of the moral ne- 
cessity for a more enlightened policy. During 
these centuries there has always existed the 
necessity of a standing military force of the 
white races, with a small proportion of the 
native or mixed elements, to swell the roll of 
private soldiers. Incipient war has generally 
existed, and the colonies where it has figured 
least aggressively have been those in which 
there has been a shrewd recognition of the 
wiser policy of providing the semi-civilized 
rulers of the illiterate native tribes with an

assured income as a return for the recognition 
of the sovereignty of the power in control. 

In view of this experience of the past, Mr. 
Ireland approaches the treatment of the colo- 
nial problems in the United States with some 
diffidence. After a recapitulation of condi- 
tions as they exist to-day, he sees little material 
for representative institutions at present among 
the people of our new possessions, with the 
exception of those of Hawaii ; and even here, 
with true British caution, he talks about that 
constitutional impossibility to the American 
mind a judicious limitation of the franchise. 
In consideration of the fact that in the matter 
of education Hawaii might serve as a model 
for the world, and that in few countries is the 
percentage of illiterates so small that the 
inhabitants have largely adopted American 
manners and customs, and (almost of greater 
importance) no foreign nation has established 
a commercial connection to rival that of the 
United States he can see no difficulties in the 
way of self-government with limited represen- 
tative institutions but without that responsible 
government which must lie with the national 
authority. He quite fails to understand our dis- 
tinction between state and national authority. 
He doubts the possibility of any hasty attempt to 
carry out this idea in Puerto Rico, where, with 
a population of 806,000, eighty-five per cent 
or more of whom can neither read nor write, 
the mixed blood and Spanish methods, together 
with custom and heredity, have produced a 
peasantry antagonistic to American civilization. 

When the situation in the Philippines is to be 
treated, the difficulties become enormous. With 
a population of near 9,000,000, where not even 
five per cent can read or write, and where 
ninety-nine hundredths are profoundly igno- 
rant, superstitious, and quite amenable to the 
control of the remaining hundredth, he just 
refrains from predicting ultimate failure for 
the United States when he acknowledges the 
shrewdness of this educated remnant, who are 
familiar with native dialects and customs. 

Mr. Ireland tells us he has met with a cer- 
tain feeling in the United States, which he 
predicts will postpone success ; namely, a pub- 
lic sentiment that the experience of other na- 
tions in the tropics is of no value to us. 
Thereupon he declares the commercial prob- 
lem, or the question of labor, to be the second 
vital difficulty in the case. He recognizes the 
fact that the products of the tropics are, next 
to the breadstuffs of the temperate zones, of 
greatest importance to the human race ; these 



tropical products are sugar, coffee, tea, cocoa, 
spices, and fruits, most of which require, dur- 
ing the important season, continuous labor. 
The ease of life where necessities are obtained 
with but little effort, together with the climatic 
conditions which discourage energy, have made 
it impossible to cultivate profitably any of 
these products without the maintenance of 
slavery or an indentured or coolie system, ab- 
horrent to the American mind. This inden- 
tured system, which prevails in Hawaii, is the 
main problem confronting us there, and every 
day's delay in fixing the status of that island 
allows the increased importation of contract 
laborers from China or Japan to complicate 
the situation. In short, he recognizes the fact 
that if the sordid commercial spirit is to con- 
trol the management of our tropical posses- 
sions, as it does that of all other nations of the 
world, it would be well to disabuse the public 
mind of some popular fallacies. Of these, the 
most melodious to the public ear is the asser- 
tion that trade follows the flag, and that trop- 
ical colonies deal primarily with the sovereign 
country. England, with her supreme advan- 
tages, can only sell to her tropical subjects 
" seventy-one cents' worth of goods each a year, 
and she draws from each only sixty-six cents' 
worth of supplies. This is the result of a 
century's work in increasing the purchasing 
and the productive power of the people of the 
British colonies. . . . The United States is of 
more value as a source of supply to the United 
Kingdom than the whole of the British Em- 
pire." The trade between the United King- 
dom and her colonies is not increasing, but 
assumes a smaller relative proportion year by 
year ; the colony, as it developes, seeking the 
open market more and more. 

So far as it is possible to judge from the 
valuable tables presented in the book, Mr. Ire- 
land concludes that it may safely be asserted 
that the flag has very little influence upon 
trade ; that in non-tropical colonies whatever 
advantage might once be attributable to the 
flag is fast disappearing, and in tropical colonies 
the trade is so small relatively that an increase 
of thirty persons in their population is less 
profitable to the United Kingdom than an 
increase of one person in the population of 
Australia or Canada. The politician and the 
statesman of the United States cannot ignore 
the experience of the enlightened nations of the 
world. If we enter the sordid contest for 
supremacy in trade, ignoring the great moral 
principles which we have claimed to dominate

our national economic and social system, we 
will be compelled to follow in great measure 
the methods of these nations. There cannot 
longer logically exist those restrictions upon 
trade which are the foundation of the destruc- 
tion of the permanent peace of nations ; and in 
the great rivalry, compulsory labor can alone be 
counted upon. ALICE ASBURY ABBOTT. 



GENERAL, WALKER'S ECONOMIC ESSAYS 
AND ADDRESSES.* 

Professor Dewey has brought together into 
two octavo volumes a mass of General Francis 
A. Walker's miscellaneous articles and ad- 
dresses which would otherwise be comparatively 
inaccessible to the general reader ; and in so 
doing he has performed a real service to the 
public, as well as to the memory of his late 
chief. General Walker was a fluent and pro- 
lific writer. Besides serving in the army dur- 
ing the war, teaching in seminary and univer- 
sity, administering the Bureau of Statistics 
and the Indian Office for short periods, man- 
aging two censuses, representing his country 
at an international monetary conference, and, 
finally, administering the great Institute of 
Technology, he found time in the intervals of 
writing nearly a dozen books to contribute fre- 
quently to periodical literature, from the scien- 
tific quarterlies to the religious weeklies, and 
for a time to the daily press, but more especially 
to the popular monthlies ; and also to prepare 
addresses for delivery before various bodies of 
which he was either the president or the hon- 
ored guest. In the present collection the editor 
has not included everything General Walker 
ever wrote, but has aimed, so far as possible, 
to avoid repetitions of thought. 

The papers composing these two volumes 
are divided into six groups, dealing respect- 
ively with Finance and Taxation, Money and 
Bimetallism, Economic Theory, Statistics, Na- 
tional Growth, and Social Economics. Under 
the first head there are some discussions of the 
national finances in the period following the 
Civil War, which have a timely as well as his- 
torical interest at the present time. This is 
especially true of an article written when the 
country began to be confronted with a surplus, 
dealing with the manner of reducing the war 
revenues. The taxes on gross receipts of cer-

A. Walker, Ph.D., LL.D. Edited by Davis R. Dewey, Ph.D.

tain corporations, on legacies and successions, 
on banks, insurance companies and gas com- 
panies, together with the documentary stamp 
duties, the writer considered ought to be re- 
tained " in justice alike to the treasury and to 
individual taxpayers." On the other hand, he 
advised giving up the licenses on occupations, 
the proprietary stamp taxes, the taxes on sales 
and on private carriages and family silver. The 
income tax he properly called a war tax, but 
he advised retaining it in time of peace at a 
reduced rate. At the same time, he urged the 
abolition of certain unimportant customs duties 
which produced more annoyance than revenue. 

When writing of the census, General Walker 
was to a large extent virtually writing his auto- 
biography as a statistician ; but he subordinated 
the personal to the scientific interest, and was 
disposed to give almost too much of the credit 
to others. Yet, both before and after taking 
charge of the Census Office in 1870, he seemed 
to take especial satisfaction in exposing the 
crudities and adsurdities of the census of 1860, 
especially in so far as it related to manufac- 
tures and to occupations. There seems to have 
been no attempt at that census to secure uni- 
formity of nomenclature ; the same occupation 
would be reported under a variety of names, 
and divided up accordingly in the published 
report. For example, those necessary evils 
known as " domestics " in certain states were 
elsewhere enumerated simply as " servants "; 
while several thousands in certain sections pre- 
ferred to describe themselves as " housekeep- 
ers," and a much smaller number of specialists 
in domestic manufacture were reported as 
" cooks." But, we are told, " the considerable 
States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illi- 
nois, Indiana, Missouri, and Massachusets, had, 
if we may trust this account, no cooks in 1860. 
The universal consumption of raw food by such 
large communities cannot fail to excite the as- 
tonishment of the future historian." 

To improve the census was General Walker's 
work for many years, and his experience can- 
not fail to be of interest to the present genera- 
tion. Some of his suggestions were carried 
out while he himself was in charge, but not all 
of them. In 1870 he found it highly unsatis- 
factory to have the census taken by assistant 
marshals appointed with partisan motives and 
subject to no control by the Census Office, and 
reporting to marshals already overburdened 
with duties of an entirely different character. 
In 1880, under an improved law, enumerators 
and supervisors were appointed specially for 



1900.]

census work, with some reference to their qual- 
ifications for that work, and from either polit- 
ical party ; while expert special agents were 
commissioned to collect information concerning 
manufactures and various other matters not 
included in the population schedule. The re- 
sult was a vast gain in both the quantity and 
quality of the work done, with an increase of 
cost amounting to less than one cent per capita. 
At first, jndeed, General Walker made the 
mistake of undertaking the very elaborate cen- 
sus of 1880 with actually smaller appropria- 
tions than had been made for the much simpler 
census of 1870 ; but he concluded that the 
million or two of dollars which he attempted to 
save to the treasury would have been a very 
poor compensation to him personally for the 
additional labors and distress he thus brought 
upon himself. 

The impossibility of tabulating, analyzing, 
and publishing the results of all the investiga- 
tions undertaken by the Census Office within 
a reasonable time led General Walker to pro- 
pose that the census proper should be confined 
to the statistics of population and agriculture, 
to be collected, preferably, once in five years ; 
and that all the other inquiries should be car- 
ried on during the intervals of the quinquen- 
nial or decennial censuses. This would involve, 
instead of periodical disorganizations and re- 
organizations, a permanent Census Office, 
which he proposed to create by simply intrust- 
ing the census work to the existing Department 
(then Bureau) of Labor. He was of the opin- 
ion that a census of the United States, being a 
necessary condition of the federal form of gov- 
ernment, and depending for its success upon 
the interest and cooperation of the whole peo- 
ple, was of sufficient importance to be an- 
nounced by executive proclamation ; and when 
first appointed to the head of the Census Office 
he asked the President to open the enumera- 
tion in that auspicious manner. 

" General Grant was not indisposed to do so, but the 
inexorable Department of State interposed its objection. 
There never had been such a proceeding, and therefore 
there never could be. Reasons were nothing as against 
precedents; and so the great national canvass was 
allowed to begin with as little of ceremony and of ob- 
servation as the annual peregrinations of a village 
assessor." 

In economics, General Walker was never an 
extremist. He was a free-trader ; but he care- 
fully distinguished between different kinds and 
degrees of protection, and recognized the evils 
of sudden changes affecting the employment of 
labor and capital ; he was a bimetallist, but he 



held that no government was powerful enough 
to establish bimetallism alone ; he was an un- 
compromising opponent of socialism, but he was 
almost as severe in his criticisms of the laissez- 
faire doctrine of the classical economists. He 
recognized that in some cases immense advan- 
tages had resulted from socialistic measures, 
and he was enough of a socialist himself to be 
decidedly in favor of certain extensions of gov- 
ernmental action for the common benefit. Thus, 
he suggested that a little direction and assist- 
ance from government would have carried hun- 
dreds of thousands of immigrants from Eastern 
ports, where their presence was a misfortune to 
themselves and to the community, to sections 
where they would have added to the strength 
and wealth of the nation. He was not afraid 
of the mere word " socialism "; for though he 
once wrote of the " frightfully socialistic char- 
acter " of a certain theory of taxation, he inti- 
mated that he would not hesitate to approve of 
sanitary inspection and regulation if they were 
as socialistic as anything ever dreamed of by 
Marx or Lasalle. " For such good as I see 
coming from this source," he said, " I would, 
were it needful, join one of Fourier's ' pha- 
lanxes,' go to the barricades with Louis Blanc, 
or be sworn into a nihilistic circle." To the 
objection against the regulation of industrial 
corporations as a violation of the laissez-faire 
principle, he replied that the very institution 
of the industrial corporation was for the pur- 
pose of avoiding that primary condition upon 
which alone true and effective competition could 
exist ; that combination was directly in contra- 
vention of competition. He agreed with the 
French socialists that the state might rightfully 
interfere with freedom of contract to secure a 
reduction in the hours of labor, improvement 
in the sanitary conditions of workshops, proper 
limits to the work required of women and 
minors, and prohibition of child-labor. When 
he wrote of " this precious Constitution of ours, 
which is never heard of except to prevent some 
good thing from being done," he had reference 
to a progressive income tax ; but he might 
easily have said the same thing about attempts 
to have eight-hour laws declared unconstitu- 
tional. His article on " Socialism " would be 
a good starting-point from which to develope a 
a science of public economy. He was not above 
discussing such subjects with fairness and can- 
dor, any more than he was above pointing out 
the errors of newly-fledged doctors of philos- 
ophy. It was only when he wrote of Mr. Bel- 
lamy's " Looking Backward " that he resorted 



18

much to ridicule, and even in that case he gave 
sound reasons as well. 

Economics in the hands of this master was 
no dismal science, because of his broad sympa- 
thies, his healthy, conservative optimism, his 
belief in the efficacy of effort ; and in a more 
superficial sense, because of his saving sense of 
humor and his happy way of putting things. 
Unlike many economists, he was the fortunate 
possessor of a very pleasing literary style ; and 
he had the rare faculty of making even such 
difficult subjects as public indebtedness and 
the money question clear and interesting to the 
general reader, as well as instructive to the 
careful student. There could have been no 
more fitting monument to his memory than 
these two volumes, together with the other vol- 
ume of " Discussions in Education." The ed- 
itor has supplied brief explanatory notes con- 
cerning many of the papers, besides giving the 
place and date of publication ; and the whole 
is accompanied by an excellent portrait.

THE COMPLEXITY OP RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS.* 

One may readily be puzzled by the diversity of 
beliefs shown in the scores of books appearing on 
religious topics. A rationalizing tendency has found 
its way, feebly or powerfully, into most of them ; 
and yet the greatest variety of conflicting conclu- 
sions is reached. One might easily infer from this 
result that hopeless confusion and inadequacy are 
associated with all statements of faith. We believe 
a sounder conclusion is to be found in the undying 
energy of this class of convictions. The complexity 
of the data involved in the exposition of the spirit- 
ual world is exceedingly great. All one's own per- 
sonal life, emotional and intellectual ; his observation

and interpretation of the world about him, both 
physical and spiritual ; the entire sweep of historic 
facts and hereditary tendencies which are either 
buoying up or submerging his thoughts, these 
constitute the basis of his opinions. Faith is the 
very last region in which we ought to expect con- 
current or final conclusions. The constant return 
of the mind to the task shows how vital and inevit- 
able are the forces which underlie all religious 
beliefs. 

The book entitled " Sursum Corda" will be found 
by many very enjoyable. It is a vigorous reasser- 
tion of the primary truths of our spiritual nature, 
with a scornful exposure of the superficial convic- 
tions associated with prevalent empirical philosophy. 
It is characterized by freshness and insight, and 
will impart new courage to those whose hope is suf- 
fering relapse. It is not to be expected, however, 
that its presence will make even an eddy in the 
current of materialism. That movement must fulfil 
itself and disprove itself in the spiritual sterility 
associated with it. As implied just now, each ten- 
dency is too complex, and, to the opposed tendency, 
too obscure, to be very directly operative, either in 
restraint or guidance. That to which the author 
would have us lift our hearts is the fulness and 
gladness and genetic force of the life which envelops 
us. The flood is likely to leave at least this slight 
fertilizing residuum a renewed sense of the phys- 
ical as the most adequate and direct expression of 
the spiritual. 

The volume on " Morality as a Religion " im- 
presses us anew with the strangeness and the unwar- 
rantable nature of the fact that men's religious 
thoughts and ethical thoughts separate themselves 
from each other, and are even brought at times into 
violent collision. The ethical law is the spiritual 
law of the world, and nothing more affirms and 
defines a Supreme Spiritual Presence in the world 
than this same law. Ethics, therefore, should be 
the support of religion, and religion the ripe fruit- 
age of ethics. While we are astonished at the folly 
of the religious faith which turns away from ethics, 
we are also disturbed at any ethical presentation, 
clear and forceful and needful as it may otherwise 
be, which is not made to lead directly to a personal 
belief in God. The volume before us has a good 
share of that discrimination and fundamental va- 
lidity of thought which characterize the ethical 
school. It is made up of seventeen discourses, de- 
livered in London to the Ethical Religion Society. 
There is much more in these discourses to which 
the liberal reader will be inclined to assent than 
there is to which he will dissent ; and it is put in so 
vigorous a way as to command his attention. 

' l The Great Affirmations of Religion " is a vol- 
ume of sermons preached in a Unitarian pulpit in 
New York. Sermons ought to be held to a high 
standard of criticism. The supply is large, and the 
market for truly stimulating discourses is unfavor- 
ably affected by the presence of inferior ones. The 
present sermons show an earnest and independent

THE DIAL 



spirit, and that speculative and aggressive temper 
which is so often present in the Unitarian pulpit. 
The thought, however, is more crude, the expres- 
sion less exact, the knowledge less digested, than 
we have a right to expect in published discourses. 

" The Gospel of Joy " indicates by its title the 
prevailing temper of the sermons the volume con- 
tains. Mr. Stopford A. Brooke has, in unusual 
degree, the essential characteristic of a good preacher 
unwavering belief. When this is united, as in his 
case, to a liberal creed and to insight and taste, it pre- 
eminently fits the preacher for persuasive discourse. 
He descends to the sluggish or distrustful listener 
from an altitude of invincible faith. One might 
offer this criticism that the author more frequently 
awakens spiritual emotion and brings it to life, than 
so interprets life as to make it the direct occasion 
and support of spiritual emotion. We need, as far 
as possible, to turn to those lines of action which 
call out and interweave the thoughts and feelings 
in the most self-sustained and living products. 

" Christian Rationalism " is a well-balanced and 
effective presentation, in a half dozen essays, of the 
points of contention and difficulty which lie be- 
tween belief and unbelief. The work is done from 
the standpoint of liberal faith, and shows, on the 
part of the author, a clear and discriminating pos- 
session of the topic. It can be cordially commended 
to those who are disturbed by current unbelief, and 
do not apprehend its ultimate drift. 

"The Divine Drama" is an effort to bring the 
parts of man's spiritual life into a coherent dra- 
matic whole under the idea of the immanency of 
the Divine Spirit. The conception is a good one, 
but it is pursued in a method so abstract in thought 
and terminology as to make the perusal laborious 
and to many unfruitful. This is the more observ- 
able as a fervor pervades the work which would 
naturally seek concrete expression. The spirit of 
the book is every way commendable, and there are 
portions of it to which the above criticism is less 
applicable. 

Dr. Henry Van Dyke's " Gospel for a World of 
Sin " is an impassioned rendering of the orthodox 
dogma of sin, the mission of Christ, the atonement. 
The author escapes all intellectual difficulties by 
denying that any final definition of our relation to 
God in Christ is possible. " Its fulness makes it inde- 
finable." It is a mystery of life. Those are most 
helpful who waive the logical relation, and give us 
their own experience of the saving power of Christ. 
It is quite true that the most valued and significant 
element in the doctrine of the atonement has been 
the spiritual life that has oftentimes gone with it 
and been nourished by it. The dogma has been 
the frame-work over which the emotional experi- 
ences of men's souls have spread themselves in lux- 
urious growth. There are those still ready to infer 
the intellectual validity of the underlying assertions 
because of the force and redemptive power of the 
feelings which have gone with them. This is the 
significance of the present volume. A truly pro- 



found and life-giving experience is once more spread 
along these lines of technical faith, hiding beneath 
it the naked statements which can no longer bear 
the light. The book will give satisfaction to many, 
and much satisfaction to those who will trace under 
it their own favorite dogma. 

" The Christian Teaching," by Count Tolstoi, is 
the skeleton of a book rather than a book ; a sketch 
of what the author proposed, rather than the ful- 
fillment of that purpose. The assertions follow 
each other in close interdependence, but with no 
effort to illustrate them, enforce them, or make 
them plausible. The temper of the book is one of 
vigorous self-abnegation. It seems to be the pro- 
duct of a violent reaction against the indulgences 
and vices of the world. Many things are thrust 
aside which we are accustomed to regard, not 
merely as sources of physical pleasure, but as an 
expression of spiritual life and as aids to it. Count 
Tolstoi at times implies that priests mislead the 
people by deceptive doctrines and rites. Whatever 
may be true of individuals, it is never true of a 
great system of faith that it rests on an organized 
effort to mislead the masses. What is deception 
in reference to the people is first darkness in the 
mind of the teacher. Like priest, like people; like 
people, like priest. If the blind lead the blind, 
both will fall into the ditch. The point is import- 
ant, for if we regard the error as purely voluntary 
we shall think the remedy correspondingly direct 
and speedy. The book is one of a noble purpose, 
and oftentimes of things soberly put with much 
force. 

Through Nature to God," by Mr. John Fiske, 
is made up of three discussions : " The Mystery of 
Evil," "The Cosmic Roots of Love and Self- 
Sacrifice," " The Everlasting Reality of Religion." 
The conclusion is strongly theistic. In the line of 
argument, and in its issue, we warmly concur. The 
work is characterized by that clear and coherent 
thought which we have come to associate with the 
writings of Mr. Fiske. We are not equally satis- 
fied with his premises. These seem to us to remain 
too narrow for the superstructure he builds upon 
them. Natural selection, the survival of the fittest, 
the cosmic process, efficient causes, retain precisely 
their old relation. Mr. Fiske drank at the begin- 
ning from the fountains of empirical philosophy so 
freely that he still shows something of the paralysis 
incident to such draughts. We must feel that 
Mr. Harrison as opposed to Mr. Spencer, and Pro- 
fessor Huxley as opposed to Professor Fiske, have 
had the keener sense of what is and what is not, 
involved in rigidly evolutionary premises. The 
immanence of God demands as much a modification 
of the notion of efficient causes as it does of the 
notion of God. In strictly eternal and efficient 
causes, there is no room left for Deity. Immanence 
in such causes means nothing. Mr. Fiske seems to 
admit freely final causes ; but final causes exclude 
efficient causes, and efficient causes exclude final 
causes as absolute terms. The two, as in human 



20

liberty, must blend along a line of perpetual inter- 
action. It is amusing to see with what heartiness 
the orthodox are wont to pat Mr. Fiske on the 
shoulder as a doughty champion from the camp of 
the enemy whose dictum finishes discussion. We 
think Mr. Fiske is hardly entitled to the assumption 
that " his argument is advanced for the first time." 

" Religion " is the first volume of the " Oxford 
Library of Practical Theology." The purpose of 
this library is " to supply some carefully considered 
teaching on matters of religion to that large body 
of devout laymen who desire instruction but are not 
attracted by the learned treatises which appeal to 
the theologian." Its notion of " carefully considered 
teaching " is somewhat rigid. " Christianity, . . . 
as enshrined in a teaching and dogmatic Church, is 
so precise and clear in its definition and outline that 
it does not hesitate to state that a right faith is nec- 
essary to salvation." The purpose of this opening 
volume may be concisely defined as a statement of 
the claims of religion, its forms, dangers, and aids. 
It is the fulfilment of this purpose, rather than the 
purpose itself, that we are inclined to criticise. The 
style of the book lacks clearness and elegance, and, 
still more, a warm personal sympathy. It seems 
like the effort of one whose conceptions are natu- 
rally dogmatic and abstract, to approach the com- 
mon mind, when not really sharing its experiences. 
There is no want of conviction and fervor, but they 
have been begotten in a narrow theological realm, 
not in the large and manifold life of the world. The 
old antithesis remains between the processes of daily 
life and the divinely ordained product offered for 
their correction. 

" Between Caesar and Jesus " is the title of a vol- 
ume containing the condensed expression of much 
writing and speaking by Prof. George D. Herron. 
One can be in very close sympathy with the general 
purpose aimed at, and still dissent decidedly from 
the manner in which it is pursued. Professor Herron 
has an ardent but not a sober mind. His state- 
ments are not true, in the impression they make, to 
the facts. He relates the evil, and that in a some- 
what extreme form, and omits for the most part 
the vast amount of good associated with it. His 
discourses are pervaded with the idea that the world 
can be precipitated into the Kingdom of Heaven by 
a sudden and radical change of methods. " When 
Christian experience becomes elemental, individual 
ownership becomes sacrilegious" (p. 135). Now, 
giving can only depend on having. If we own 
nothing, we can confer nothing. We can render no 
service if we have no right to withhold service. We 
are slaves. Our service must be the freedom of a 
spiritual nature which the recipient cannot over- 
ride. But if we own service, if we own our own 
powers, we may own property, which is, or may be, 
only a tangible expression of those powers. Our 
goodness, our love, can only find play in a world not 
altogether unlike our own, in which the limits of 
ownership are one thing and the uses of ownership 
another. 



We have, in the three books last noticed, a very 
diverse conception of the world. Mr. Fiske is wait- 
ing patiently, perhaps too patiently (are we not our- 
selves a part of Nature?), on natural forces for 
renovation. Mr. Newbolt is urging a new enforce- 
ment of dogma. Mr. Herron wishes to enter into 
life by a violent change of its forms. What the 
last method gains in intention, it loses in wisdom. 
We are to work with God, not outwork Him. When 
one's changes become immediate and radical we- 
much prefer to wait on natural law.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

One easily forgives the somewhat too 
constant an d high-pitched strain of 
eulogium in Miss Helen M. Knowl- 
ton's lively and sympathetic sketch of the " Art- 
Life of William Morris Hunt" (Little, Brown, & 
Co.). The author is a former pupil of this capable 
and for a long time not duly appreciated American 
painter, and her vigorous advocacy of his artistic 
merits seems a little belated now that those merits 
have had ample recognition. Hunt's diversified 
life, striking personality, and interesting list of 
clients and acquaintances made him a promising 
subject for the biographer, and Miss Knowlton has 
produced a decidedly readable book. Hunt studied 
abroad, and was for some time a pupil of the then 
reigning Paris favorite, Couture, who finally de- 
clared that his diligent and enthusiastic American 
pupil had so absorbed his manner of painting that 
he had carried it as far as it could go. Couture 
was presently supplanted in Hunt's admiration by 
Millet, then comparatively a pictor ignotus, whose 
devoted admirer and intimate Hunt became, and 
whose now priceless canvasses he bought for a song. 
He acquired, for instance, that masterpiece "The 
Sower" for sixty dollars, and "The Sheep-Shear- 
ers " for the amount of an outstanding color-bill of 
the master's (about ninety dollars). "I bought," 
he says, " as much of Millet's work as I could, and 
after a while the idea was started that a rich En- 
glishman was buying up all his pictures." The 
effect upon the " peasant-painter's " fortunes of this 
rumor may be imagined. Millet, said Mr. Hunt, 
" had so little money in his life that he never owned 
a hundred-dollar bill until I gave him the money 
for one of his pictures. . . . When I handed it to 
him he did not say much ; but he told me next day 
that he could not try to thank me, but I might like 
to know that he had never before had a hundred- 
dollar bill." It is amusing to know that Hunt's 
purchases of Millet's pictures gained him at Paris 
the sobriquet of " the mad American." Hunt's 
subsequent career in America, especially as por- 
trait-painter, brought him in contact with many 
celebrities. Lincoln, Justice Shaw, Holmes, Emer- 
son, Whittier, Sumner, Governor Andrew, Dr. 
J. F. Clarke, and many others known to fame, sat to

him ; and his intercourse with the leading lights of 
his day and place gave rise to a fund of anecdotage 
of which his biographer has duly availed herself. 
The story of Hunt's active and checkered life is 
told graphically and in due detail down to the 
tragic finale at Mrs. Thaxter's retreat, " Apple- 
dore," in 1879 ; and supplementary chapters re- 
lating to the Hunt exhibitions of 1879, 1880, and 
1881 (at London) are added. The illustrations 
form an attractive feature of the book, and show 
conclusively that Hunt's forte lay in portraits, 
rather than in the ambitious compositions he often 
essayed. 

Chapters in ^ n ^* s l earne d aQ d elaborate volume 

the history of entitled " The Cathedral Builders " 
architecture. (Scribner's importation), Mr. Leader 
Scott tells the story of a great mediaeval guild of 
Freemasons (Liberi Muratori), and essays to show 
that this guild, the Comacine Masters, formed a link 
between Classic and Renaissance art. In most his- 
tories of Italian art there is a hiatus of several cen- 
turies between the ancient classic art of Rome 
which was in its decadence when the Western Em- 
pire ceased in the fifth century after Christ and 
that early rise of art in the twelfth century which 
led to the Renaissance. During this period of sub- 
mergence of the ancient civilization of Rome, classic 
architectural and sculptural art has been generally 
supposed to have utterly vanished and died out, its 
corpse lying entombed, so to speak, in its Byzan- 
tine cerements at Ravenna. This suspicious break 
in the unity and continuity of European architectu- 
ral history has inspired Mr. Scott to the researches 
and speculations which have led to his very plausi- 
ble if not conclusively established theory that classic 
structural art, in point of fact, was at no time ex- 
tinct, but was continuously conserved and practised, 
however obscurely, by the Magistri Comacini, and 
really passed without break through Romanesque 
forms up to the Gothic, and hence to the full Ren- 
aissance. In fine, the productions of the Comacine 
Masters must be regarded, if we accept Mr. Scott's 
view, as linking the art of the Classic schools to 
that of the Renaissance, just as the transitional Ro- 
mance languages of Provence and Languedoc link 
the Latin of classic times to modern languages. All 
the different Italian styles, argues Mr. Scott, are 
nothing more than the different developments in 
differing climates and ages of the art of one power- 
ful guild of sculptor-builders, who nursed the seed 
of Roman art on the border-land of the falling Ro- 
man Empire, and spread the growth in far-off 
countries. All that was architecturally good in 
Italy between 500 and 1200 A. D. was due to this 
society which sprang from a small island in the 
Lake Como, and ramified, under the patronage of 
the Church, throughout Europe. Through this 
means, architecture and sculpture were carried into 
France, Spain, Germany, and England, and were 
there adapted and developed in accordance with the 
new environment. " The flat roofs, horizontal archi- 



traves, and low arches of the Romanesque, which 
suited a warm climate, gradually changed as they 
went northward into the pointed arches and sharp 
arches of the Gothic ; the steep sloping lines being 
a necessity in a land where snow and rain were fre- 
quent." The well-based and ingenious speculations 
of Mr. Scott merit the attention of all serious stu- 
dents of the history of architecture, and his account 
of the hitherto neglected Maestri Comacini (ne- 
glected, at least, by most English authorities) is most 
interesting. Professor Merzario's voluminous work, 
" I Maestri Comacini," has been freely drawn upon 
as a storehouse of facts, by Mr. Scott, who is also 
to be credited with much painstaking independent 
research. A table of the authorities consulted is 
appended. The volume is handsomely and liberally 
illustrated, and is soundly and elegantly manufac- 
tured throughout. 

In " Searchlight Letters " (Scribner) 

we ou s ht to ha the most p erful 

light known to science cast upon dark 
places, with the result that we see what is to be 
avoided. That, in a way, we do have in Mr. Robert 
Grant's latest book. Mr. Grant writes of the ideal 
possible to young men and women, of the career 
.open to women of society, of the true American, of 
evils in our politics. In every case he plays the 
usual part of the searchlight, as we have stated it. 
There is, however, another use for the searchlight 
which Mr. Grant has also had in mind ; namely, the 
discovery of the right channel, when it is otherwise 
hard to find. Here we incline to think him less 
successful. Mr. Grant first became known in the 
world of letters as a satirist. Time has mellowed 
what once was almost maliciousness, but it has not 
wholly changed his spirit. He is still the observer 
of society, who can make its errors ridiculous. In 
his earlier works, however, Mr. Grant was content 
with the more usual office of the searchlight ; while 
now he is possessed with a further ambition. He 
would be not only a warning but a guide. Hence 
his " Art of Living," which is just now republished 
in the same form as the above, making a very pretty 
pair of books. The earlier volume was one of ad- 
vice on the subject of how best to live on an income 
of ten thousand dollars. The later book is more 
generally directed. Yet, its critical value is greater 
than its power of suggestion. The sketches of peo- 
ple who have missed their aim are excellent ; such 
has often been the case with those who seek to lead 
toward virtue by an exhibition of vice. Mr. Grant 
is as clever as ever in his delineation of error, of 
the city politician, of the society woman. But we 
do not warm up at his propositions for a better life. 
They are very earnest, but, like many other ser- 
mons, they are dull. "The noblest aims of the 
aspiring past," " a keener appreciation of the con- 
ditions of human life," " a compound of independ- 
ence and energy," " allegiance to the eternal femi- 
nine," "broader and wiser humanity," are not 
these phrases that we have heard before, and not

infrequently? They have a familiar sound. They 
are good ideas : we approve of them. But we needed 
no searchlight to know how to find them. Even 
with them, indeed, we may still feel that we would 
like one word more, a word just a bit more insist- 
ent on reality. Anything of this sort is quite lack- 
ing here. But Mr. Grant is a well-known writer, 
and everybody who reads his latest book will have 
a fair idea of what is to be found within its covers ; 
we fancy that no one will be more disappointed than 
we have been, and we hope everyone will gain as 
much pleasure. 

Miss Frances Gerard picturesquely 
The mad King recapitulates, in an attractive volume 

of Havana. *" 

of oOO odd pages, the grimly fasci- 
nating " Romance of Ludwig II. of Bavaria " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.). There is an introductory 
chapter on the "Heredity of the King," after which 
the author proceeds to give an account of Ludwig's 
rather schwarmarisch character and occasional wild 
outbreaks as a boy, which prepares the reader for 
the strangest of all strange historical stories that 
follows, and incidentally makes him wonder at the 
survival, in our unimaginative era of hard sense, of 
a political superstition which makes it possible for 
a great civilized people to be under the rule and at 
the mercy of a known madman for a couple of de- 
cades. The devoted, king-worshipping way in which 
the honest Bavarians endured and even applauded 
the Bedlamite follies and wild expenditures of this 
poor lunatic would almost surpass belief in America, 
were it not for our own almost passive endurance 
of the yoke of such rulers as Platt and Croker. 
But the Bavarians never thought of protesting 
against the political crime and anomaly; we do 
protest, loudly and bitterly, and at intervals effect- 
ively. The mad career of the unhappy Ludwig 
began early. While a boy of twelve he was found 
by' a tutor endeavoring, in the exercise of his pre- 
rogative as Crown Prince, to choke to death with a 
knotted pocket-handkerchief his younger brother 
Otto. Young Otto was discovered in a fainting 
condition, lying upon the grass, gagged, and bound 
hand and foot, while the Prince was twisting the 
handkerchief with a piece of stick, in the approved 
Chinese and Turkish fashion. When interfered 
with by the officious tutor, this precious sprig of 
mediaeval royalty imperiously bawled : " This is no 
business of yours ; this is my vassal, and he has 
dared to resist my will. He must be executed ! " 
The Potsdam form or phase of megalomania has 
scarcely reached this pitch. The author tells her 
story interestingly, with many anecdotes, strange, 
tragic, and tragico-comic, down to the final and ter- 
rible finale by Starnberg Lake. An interesting 
chapter is devoted to the mad king's building 
mania and the gorgeous structures he erected, and 
all in all the book must be pronounced a very read- 
able one of its kind. It is profusely and hand- 
somely illustrated, and should prove a good satchel 
companion for the tourist to Munich. 



Reissue of Thirty-five years have elapsed since 
Mr. Spencer's the appearance of the first edition of 
"Biology." Mr Spencer's " Principles of Biol- 
ogy" years that have witnessed an unparalleled 
development of the biological sciences both in the 
discovery of data and in the elaboration of theory. 
They have seen the application of these discoveries 
to the detection of the factors of organic evolution 
and to the fuller correlation of biology with the 
physical sciences. The comprehensiveness and pre- 
vision of the earlier work of Mr. Spencer in this 
field is evidenced by the fact that the author finds 
but little to modify in the new edition (Appleton), 
the principal changes taking the form pf additions 
and supplementary discussions. Thus, we find a 
chapter on metabolism in which the relation of or- 
ganic chemistry to vital processes is treated at length. 
Under the caption, " The Dynamic Element in Life," 
the author introduces a discussion of the essential 
element in vital phenomena " a certain unspeci- 
fied principle of activity " which cannot be conceived 
in physico-chemical terms. It is not an independent 
vital principle, nor can it be represented as a prin- 
ciple inherent in living matter. The ultimate reality 
behind vital phenomena, as behind all manifesta- 
tions, transcends conception. A chapter upon struc- 
ture has been added ; and another all too brief 
upon cell-life and cell-multiplication lays under 
tribute the marvellous discoveries of the past decade. 
The accumulation of facts has necessitated an entire 
revision of the chapter on the embryological evi- 
dences of organic evolution. The author's theory 
of physiological units is extended and more fully 
applied to the problems of heredity and variation 
in a supplementary discussion introduced in this 
edition ; while a few pages at the close of the book 
are devoted to answers to recent criticisms and to a 
brief consideration of new theories. Among the 
appendices we find reprinted from " The Contem- 
porary Review " a series of four controversial essays 
on Weismannism, a discussion of animal fertility, 
and a summary of the evidence favoring the inher- 
itance of acquired characters. This new edition is 
indispensable for all who wish information on cur- 
rent themes of biological discussion. It is a matter 
for regret that the health of the author did not per- 
mit a fuller treatment and a more complete incor- 
poration of his views on the controverted questions 
of the day. 

" A History of the Jewish People " 
(Scribner), covering the Babylonian, 
Persian, and Greek periods, is the 
third volume in a series especially intended for 
Bible students and scholars, and hence cannot justly 
be reviewed as a work for popular reading, or indeed 
for any who have not already gone far in modern 
higher criticism. It is distinctly a scholar's book 
for scholars of Bible history and interpretation. In 
his preface, the author, Mr. Charles Foster Kent, 
of the chair of Biblical History and Literature in 
Brown University, states that the period covered in

the work has until recently been regarded as the 
least important and most uninteresting of any con- 
stituting the background of the Bible. Yet, if action 
is lacking in Jewish history for the four centuries 
that followed the destruction of Jerusalem, modern 
interest and study have been stimulated by the rec- 
ognition that it was in this period, more than in any 
other, that the leaders of the Jewish race meditated 
and wrote. The author does not claim that his 
findings are in any sense final, for upon many points 
material is as yet too scarce to warrant more than 
a supposititious conclusion. His analyses of his- 
torical conditions influencing the writing of various 
portions of the Old Testament are, however, most 
lucid ; and his arguments everywhere indicate fair- 
mindedness and scholarship. The biblical litera- 
ture of the period is interpreted in the light of 
history, with just enough of the latter to present 
the setting, and without unnecessary recapitulation. 
In addition to the customary index, special refer- 
ences are inserted for the use of the student. Of 
these, the most valuable are the list, with criticisms 
by the author, of books of reference upon Jewish 
history, and the Bible references, by chapter and 
verse, to historical events of the period covered. 

History and ^ n * ne P etr y an d fiction for which 

romance of Scotland long has been so famous, 

Scottish abbeys. her abbey8 cla ; m no gmall share of 

the romantic interest. It is not enough to know 
the history and the architectural motives of these 
ecclesiastical structures : one must also be somewhat 
familiar with their traditional and romantic lore, 
before one can feel the full charm of these pict- 
uresque ruins of North Britain. Each has its own 
peculiar point of interest, some feature or detail 
which the others do not possess, or at least do not 
present in an equally interesting way. In one case 
it may be the vaulting; in another, the majestic 
Norman work ; in another, the recollection of some 
poetic halo, as at Melrose " by the pale moonlight " ; 
in another, the site, or the precious bones entombed 
within, as at Dryburgh. Dealing with such matters 
as these, skilfully blending the architectural, the 
historic, and the poetic interest, Mr. Howard 
Crosby Butler has made of " Scotland's Ruined 
Abbeys" (Macmillan) an exceedingly fascinating 
book. Added to the discriminating and compact 
text are copious illustrations, mostly drawn by him- 
self on the spot, together with plans of the original 
structures. Eighteen of these ruins are thus de- 
scribed and illustrated with a completeness and 
brilliancy that is very welcome in a field where the 
material hitherto has existed only in a form too 
bulky and technical for general use. 



The original 
Bluebeard. 



Gillas de Retz must have been much 
worse than Bluebeard, if we rightly 
estimate the evidence presented by 
Mr. Thomas Wilson in his monograph on the his- 
tory of that worthy, " Bluebeard, a Contribution to 
History and Folklore " (Putnam). We have never 



heard anything worse of Bluebeard than that he 
had many wives and killed them. Of course this 
is not a good thing to do, but even Perrault shows 
that Bluebeard had provocation : his wives were 
disobedient. Henry VIII. does not seem always to 
have had this excuse. Gilles de Retz killed no wives : 
his specialty was the murder of young men and wo- 
men, and he appears to have done more killing than 
Bluebeard did. Mr. Wilson, in giving a careful 
historical account of his subject, gives no notion of 
how it came to pass that the mediaeval baron who 
decoyed children to his castle, and murdered them 
for his experiments on the philosopher's stone or 
the elixir of life, became the fearful personage with 
the blue beard who had that closet with the horrible 
contents. It is a good deal of a change. Taking 
the book for what it is, however, we may read with 
interest this study of one of the dark and horrible 
episodes of the Middle Ages, one of the strange ele- 
ments in a history that we sometimes pass over too 
lightly, sometimes indue with too great a glamor, 
but rarely appreciate for just what it was. 



The founder 
of Medicean 
Florence. 



Cosimo de Medici is the subject of 
the latest addition to the " Foreign 
Statesmen "series (Macmillan). The 
author, Miss K. Dorothea Ewart, in a scholarly 
monograph maintains the high standard previously 
fixed by other contributors to this series. Miss 
Ewart's portrait of the Florentine statesman shows 
him as the ruler of the city, not by virtue of hold- 
ing an important office, nor by assumed or inherited 
authority. Cosimo's power and influence were due 
to political sagacity in the use of his great wealth, 
to a steady purpose, an even temper, and a not too 
scrupulous conscience. He was the real government 
of the city of Florence, controlling all branches of 
administration, yet holding no office of importance. 
He was called vindictive, was accused of all manner 
of corruption, of interference with justice, of the 
manipulation of public funds. Yet when the worst 
has been said, it remains true that Florence owed 
to his wisdom and diplomatic skill all her import- 
ance in foreign relations, and that the great mass 
of the people of the city regarded him with admir- 
ation and had confidence in his ability. While there 
is no attempt to veil the shortcomings nor to con- 
done the evils in the life of the founder of Medi- 
cean Florence, the work, taken all in all, presents 
the better side of his character.

with the illustrious dead. We have here chapters 
on " May Day by Greta Side," " At the Grasmere 
Sports," " The Sheep- Dog Trials at Troutbeck," 
" A North Country Eisteddfod," " Daffodil Day at 
Cockermouth," etc. But familiarity has bred no 
contempt in our author's case, and it is with the 
utmost sensitiveness and enthusiasm that he deals 
with such subjects as " Purple and Ivory at the 
Lakes," " The Rainbow Wonders of Windermere," 
" St. Luke's Summer at the Lakes," and " A Sun- 
rise over Helvellyn." It is a matter for gratitude 
that this beautiful region, beloved by the poets, has 
escaped the fate that often befalls literary shrines, 
and remains for the most part still undespoiled and 
uncontaminated by greedy and unscrupulous money- 
makers. The tourist finds the natural surroundings 
remaining much the same as when the great dead 
here wrote and sang ; the dust of two Laureates 
hallows its soil ; and everywhere the genius loci 
puts him in touch with the thoughts and visions of 
its glorious past. 

The second part of Dr. Davenport's 
" Experimental Morphology " (Mac- 
millan) is devoted to the effect of 
chemical and physical agents upon growth. The 
author has compiled from original sources a well 
developed and skilfully arranged summary of the 
results of scientific investigation in this field of 
widening interest. The general reader will find in 
its pages a concise but lucid discussion of the phe- 
nomena of normal growth, of the effect of chemical 
agents upon the rate and the direction of growth, of 
the effect of water, of the density of the surround- 
ing medium, of molar agents, of gravity, of elec- 
tricity, of light, and of heat. The work is timely 
and has been much needed, occupying as it does a 
field common to botany, zoology, and physiology. 
Students and specialists will appreciate this dis- 
criminating resume drawn from widely scattered 
sources which are fully indicated in the extensive 
bibliographies appended to the various chapters. 
The critical analysis of the results is supplemented 
at times from the author's own work, and suggest- 
ions of lines for the future development of the 
science are freely given. The book is thus a mine 
of information, an inspiration to the student, and an 
incentive to the investigator. 

The publication of the plays of Mr. 
Henry Arthur Jones continues, and 
we have in " Carnac Sahib " (Mac- 
millan ) a play which we believe is little known, and 
which, if it become known more widely, we think 
will raise the reputation of its author. We have 
several times had occasion to say that the plays of 
Mr. Jones, however well fitted for the stage, do not 
impress one who reads them as being excellent. 
They usually seem earnest and conventional. " Car- 
nac Sahib " is not a great play, but it has in it pas- 
sages which are more real than anything of Mr. 
Jones's that we have previously read. That is not 



much, perhaps, but still it is something. To come 
on a passage or two that give you a real thrill, an 
opening, as it were, into wider vistas, a feeling dif- 
ferent from that inspired by the common run of 
dramatic situations, that is something worth hav- 
ing. One who reads much nowadays is apt not to 
get this feeling too often ; or, perhaps we should 
say, is apt to be a little hardened to the usual means 
of producing it. In reading " Carnac Sahib " you 
miss the red coats and Indian scenery and firing of 
guns that would have been exciting on the stage, so 
that it is well to have something to make it up. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Those who are looking for an account of the enlarge- 
ment of American territory, told in a brief and plain 
way, will find what they want in Mr. Edward Bicknell's 
" Territorial Acquisitions of the United States " (Small, 
Maynard & Co.). The general reader and the teacher 
of the history of the United States in the common 
schools should find the little book useful, and will no 
doubt do so. The ground covered is from Louisiana to 
Hawaii. The results of the Spanish war seem not to 
be regarded by the author as coming within the scope 
of his book. 

" A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry," prepared by 
Mr. C. C. James, is a pamphlet publication of the Vic- 
toria University Library, and is printed by Mr. William 
Briggs of Toronto. Although only English verse is 
considered, the titles run up to something like five or 
six hundred, arranged alphabetically under the names of 
their authors, and the notes supplied in each case make 
the work a valuable one for purposes of reference. The 
total showing is such as to occasion no little surprise at 
the amount of Canadian verse, and at the number of 
names that stand for a more than local reputation. 

The 300th anniversary of Oliver Cromwell's birth 
(April 25, 1599) has given opportunity for many pub- 
lications treating of the man or of his times. Among 
the less ambitious works of this character, Mr. G. H. 
Pike's "Cromwell and his Times" (Lippincott) fur- 
nishes the reader with a brief sketch of the political and 
military life of the hero. The book is chatty and read- 
able, without any attempt at argumentation or novelty. 
The author has selected from various authorities the 
customary view of Cromwell, his associates, arid his op- 
ponents, and has presented this view in pleasant form. 

The second volume, dated September, of " The Anglo- 
Saxon Review " (Lane) has a binding after an example 
by Derome, dated about 1770-80. The portraits include 
Zuccaro's Elizabeth, Van Dyck's Countess of Sunder- 
land, Antonio Moro's William the Silent, Mr. Gordon 
Craig's Sir Henry Irving, and others. While the liter- 
ary contents of the volume hardly equal the menu of its 
predecessor, they offer excellent and substantial fare. 
There are stories by Miss Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler 
and Mr. William J. Locke, poems by Mr. Stephen 
Phillips and Mr. F. B. Money Coutts, and essays by 
Mr. Silvanus P. Thompson, Mr. L. F. Austin, Mr. Cyril 
Davenport, Mr. W. Brook Adams, and the Earl of 
Crewe. There is a review of the affaire Dreyfus, and 
nearly sixty pages of letters by the Duchess of Devon- 
shire, the latter an altogether disproportionate feature 
of the volume.

LjITERARY NOTES. 

Mr. John Lane has just published a second edition of 
" Mademoiselle Blanche," a novel by Mr. J. D. Barry. 

" Moments with Art," published by Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co., is an anthology of brief descriptive 
bits, mostly in verse, about the great painters and 
sculptors. It is a companion volume to the " Musical 
Moments " of the same publishers. 

The first part of Henryk Sienkiewicz's new historical 
romance, "The Knights of the Cross," is announced 
for immediate publication by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. The work is now appearing as a serial in Poland, 
and the second part is still unfinished. 

FitzGerald's translations of " Salaman and Absal " 
and the " Bird Parliament " have just been republished 
in a neat volume by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. The 
work is issued under the editorial care of Mr. Nathan 
Haskell Dole, who contributes an introduction. 

The family of the late Dr. Daniel Garrison Brinton 
have requested Mr. Stewart Culin of the University of 
Pennsylvania to prepare a memoir of the distinguished 
Americanist. Mr. Culin is desirous of obtaining copies 
of Dr. Brinton's letters and other literary materials, 
which may be sent to him at the University of Penn- 
sylvania. 

The " Book of Seventeenth Century Lyrics " which 
Professor Felix E. Schelling has edited for Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. brings together upwards of two hundred 
examples of the English lyric from 1625 to 1700, pro- 
viding them with notes and an elaborate introductory 
essay. The work is very well done, and will prove a 
boon to students of the subject. 

Dr. Ibsen's new play was announced for publication 
in Copenhagen on the nineteenth of December, and 
will soon be obtainable in this country. The title is 
' Naar Vi Dode Vaagner " (When We Dead Awaken), 
which excites much curiosity. It is now three years, 
instead of the usual two, since there has been a new 
Ibsen play, which whets our appetite all the more. 

A new issue of the Ingram edition of " The Works 
of Edgar Allan Poe," in four volumes, has been pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. While this edition has 
been completely superseded for critical purposes by the 
work of Messrs. Woodberry and Stedman, its low price 
and neatness of execution will no doubt continue to 
secure for it the favor of the uncritical general reader. 

The Romanes Lecture for 1899 was given by Pro- 
fessor R. C. Jebb, who chose for his subject " Human- 
ism in Education." After a brief historical survey, the 
author sets forth in admirable language the reasons 
why classical studies still continue to provide the best 
type of education for the modern world, and discourses 
hopefully of their future. The lecture is published in 
.pamphlet form by the Macmillan Co. 

" The Journal of Theological Studies " is the name 
of a new quarterly periodical published by the Macmil- 
lan Co. It is dignified in appearance, and the names 
of the contributors inspire confidence. They include, 
for example, Canon Sanday, the Master of Balliol, and 
Mr. Robert Bridges. If it be asked what the latter is 
doing in that galley, we reply that he is discoursing 
most sensibly and instructively upon the principles of 
hymn-singing, of which subject so true a singer surely 
ought to know something. 

The " Cupid Calendar " for 1900, published by Mr. 
R. H. Russell, is an imposing affair, consisting of twelve 



large reproductions, about 16 x 23 inches in size, of 
pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. J. Campbell Phillips. As 
may be inferred from the title, each of the drawings 
represents a scene in which " Dan Cupid " plays a lead- 
ing part. Another attractive calendar issued by the same 
publisher is Mr. Frank Ver Beck's " Animal Calendar," 
made up of a dozen drawings in Mr. Ver Beck's well- 
known and inimitable manner, with accompanying verses. 

The first number of "The International Monthly," 
edited by Mr. F. A. Richardson, and published by the 
Messrs. Macmillan in New York and London, has just 
made its appearance, and offers a substantial table of 
contents. The papers are five in number, as follows: 
" Later Evolutions of French Criticism," by M. Edouard 
Rod ; " Influence of the Sun upon the Formation of the 
Earth's Surface," by Professor N. S. Shaler; "Recent 
Advance in Physical Science," by Professor John Trow- 
bridge; "Organization among American Artists," by 
Mr. Charles DeKay; and "The Theatrical Syndicate," 
by Mr. Norman Hapgood. 

" The Kipling Birthday Book " (Doubleday), com- 
piled by Mr. Joseph Finn and illustrated by Mr. J. 
Lockwood Kipling, presents the collection of tags in 
verse and prose usually found in books of this sort, and 
has the usual blank spaces designed to entrap the un- 
wary into confessing their ages. " A Kipling Primer " 
(Brown & Co.), by Mr. Frederick Lawrence Knowles, 
includes a biography, a critical appreciation, some bib- 
liographical matter, and a rather useful " index to Mr. 
Kipling's principal writings," the latter alphabetically 
arranged, and provided with descriptive notes. But the 
notion of making Mr. Kipling the subject of a primer indi- 
cates an altogether exaggerated view of his importance. 

Dr. Elliott Coues, who died at Baltimore on Christ- 
mas evening, was one of the most distinguished of Amer- 
ican scientists. Born in Portsmouth, N. H., in 1842, 
he crowded into his life of fifty-seven years a great 
variety of activities, and died with more work to his 
credit than may be claimed by many scholars even at 
the most advanced age. He was first and foremost an 
ornithologist, but several other branches of science oc- 
cupied a share of his attention, and in later life he took 
up the subject of early Western history, applying to it 
the energy that characterized all of his undertakings. 
His scientific reputation was for a time somewhat 
clouded by his espousal of certain vagaries connected 
with " psychical research," but the solidity and value 
of his true scientific work remains unquestionable. As 
an old-time contributor to this journal, we have special 
reason to mourn his death. 

From Mr. R. H. Russell we have received, too late 
for consideration among the notices of Holiday publica- 
tions in our last issue, three books of the pronounced 
" Holiday " type which should not go without a word of 
mention. " In Summertime," the most imposing volume 
of the trio, is a collection of carefully-printed reproduc- 
tions of Mr. Robert Reid's beautiful paintings of young 
girls and out-door life. Next in importance is a sump- 
tuous edition of Bunyan's little-known " Life and Death 
of Mr. Badman," with twelve full-page illustrations and 
numerous decorations by Messrs. George and Louis 
Rhead, whose edition of " The Pilgrim's Progress " met 
with much favor last year. Finally, we have a hand- 
some volume entitled " Hits at Politics," containing a 
collection of seventy-one of the best of Mr. W. A. 
Rogers's well-known cartoons, most of which have ap- 
peared on the front cover of " Harper's Weekly " dur- 
ing the past few years.

SOME INTERESTING NEW BOOKS 



TWO TIMELY BOOKS ON SOUTH AFRICA. 

SIDE LIGHTS ON SOUTH AFRICA 

By ROY DEVEREUX. With a map. Crown 8vo t $1.75. 

'THIS is the latest and best work on the British-Boer War. The author has had most unusual opportunity 
* for observation, having recently visited Johannesburg, Kimberley, Mafeking, and other places in South 
Africa, and having had interviews with President Kruger, President Steyn, Sir Alfred Milner, and Cecil 
Rhodes. Her narrative is most vivid and thoroughly up-to-date, giving a clear account of South Africa as it 
is to-day.

THE ADVENTURES AND OBSERVATIONS OF AN AMERICAN IN RHODESIA. 
By WILLIAM HARVEY BROWN. With 32 illustrations and 2 folding maps. Octavo, $3.00. 
" Every word in Mr. Brown's ' On the South African Frontier ' is the simple, straightforward word of a frontiersman 
who has a tale to tell, and tells it without too much varnish. 'T is an active, courageous American boy, who has gone out 
into God's Wilderness to try his fortune. He should have a hearing. As a mere narrative of stirring adventures, the 
book can be recommended to the general reader ; but it is of especial value just now on account of the interesting side 
light it throws upon the British method of governing savages." Literature. 

THE BOOK OF THE YEAR. 

THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON 

Edited by SIDNEY COLVIN. Illustrated. 2 vols., 8vo, $5.00 net. 

" They are, in the first place, saturated with the spirit of literature. . . . One is continually aware, in reading these 
letters, of felicities of style, charming turns of phrase, of the play, variety, and freshness of an artistic mind ; and these, 
it is hardly necessary to say, combined with that sense of form which was almost a passion with Stevenson, are the qual- 
ities which ruake literature. As a piece of literature, this correspondence will long be read." The Outlook, 

A THRILLING RECORD OF ADVENTURE. 

THE HIGHEST ANDES 

By EDWARD A. FITZ GERALD, F.R.Q.S. 

With 40 full-page illustrations, 10 of them in photogravure. Large 8vo, $6.00 net. 

" A well-written record of a most arduous piece of exploration, carefully planned, and carried out with amazing pluck 
in the teeth of difficulties, discouragements, and dangers. ... It is almost appalling to one whose experience of mountain 
terrors does not range beyond the Alps to read of the risks and hardships cheerfully faced by these intrepid explorers." 
The Athenceum. 

TWO NOTABLE NOVELS. 



In Connection with 
The De Willoughby Claim 

By FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT. 

Third large edition. 12mo, $1.50. 
" Her characters are masterpieces of creation, and their 
range is a wide one. In ' Big Tom De Willoughby ' Mrs. 
Burnett has created a distinctly unique character. We are 
happier and better for knowing him." New York Times 
Saturday Review. 



For the Freedom of the Sea 

By CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY. 

Richly illustrated. 12mo, $1.50. 
" The very name of this noble romance is like a clarion 
call. . . . The whole story deals with powerful motives and 
great deeds. Its tone is elevated, its style vivid and en- 
thralling. It is distinctively one of the strong books of the 
year." Boston Journal.

THE DIAL, 



[Jan. 16, 




NEVER before, perhaps, in the history of this country has it been possible to reach with a 
popular novel such tremendous figures of circulation. The quantity of cheap magazines 
has apparently created an army of new readers, and a successful book to-day is probably more 
widely circulated than at any time in the history of this country. The notable books in point 
of circulation to-day are : " David Harum," " Richard Carvel," and " Janice Meredith." 

The surprising number of 400,000 was reached by " David Harum " in a little over a 
year. " Richard Carvel " in seven months reached about 300,000 ; but perhaps the most 
remarkable record is that of "Janice Meredith," which in three mouths has reached 200,000 
copies. 

Three months after publication " David Harum " had hardly been recognized at all, while 
of " Richard Carvel " about 100,000 had been announced in that space of time. It is proba- 
bly the case that the record of " Janice Meredith " (200,000 in three months) is the most 
remarkable one achieved in this country by any novel during the past generation, not even 
excepting such remarkable " sellers " as " Trilby," " Ben-Hur," " The Choir Invisible," " Little 
Lord Fauntleroy," " Robert Elsmere," " The Prisoner of Zenda," " Quo Vadis," " Beside the 
Bonnie Brier Bush," " The Little Minister," " The Christian," and " Looking Backward."

THE END OF AN ERA 

By JOHN S. WISE. Large crown 8vo, $2.00.

rivalled as a picture of Virginia life just before and 
during the civil war." Boston Herald.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 



RECOLLECTIONS OF A JOURNALIST. 

The retirement of Mr. Godkin from the ed- 
itorship of the New York " Evening Post " and 
" Nation " has occasioned deep regret on the 
part of those who know how valiantly he has 
been fighting, for forty years or more, in de- 
fence of pure government, intellectual sanity, 
worthy ideals of life and character, and those 
principles of public policy which made our na- 
tion great and may yet save it from the moral 
disintegration with which it is now threatened. 
While we must admit that the veteran editor 
has earned his rest, it is none the less a mis- 
fortune that his voice should be silenced, since 
the struggle to preserve these things which 
are lovely and of good report in our public life 
bids fair to become fiercer than ever before, 
and such inspiration as he has so long given 
us is needed more than ever in the present dark 
hour of the Republic. We are not of those 
who would say that " the struggle nought avail- 
eth," for our faith is still firm in the potency 
of moral ideas, and in the certainty of their 
ultimate triumph ; but we should be blind to 
all the signs of the times did we not realize that 
the nineteenth hundred of Christian years, so 
fair to us in the promise of its dawn, is going 
out in clouded skies. Never were we in such 
need of soldiers, of leaders Ritter vom Geiste 
as at this century- end, when the " forts of 
folly " loom more grimly than ever upon the 
view. 

" When was age so crammed with menace ? madness ? 
written, spoken lies ? " 

These are the questions asked a few years ago 
by the wisest poet of our English race, and 
what he further said of England is still more 
applicable to America : 
" Step by step we gain'd a freedom known to Europe, 

known to all; 
Step by step we rose to greatness, thro' the tongue- 

sters we may fall." 

We have been impelled to these reflections 
by reading the intensely interesting chapter of 
personal reminiscences which Mr. Godkin con- 
tributed a few days ago to the newspaper of 
which he was so recently the editor. Reading 
these random jottings, there is brought before 



38 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



us the contrast between the old and the new, 
not in journalism alone, but in several other 
matters which throw light upon the psychology 
of public opinion. For example, that amazing 
illustration of the new diplomacy which was 
offered by Mr. Cleveland's Venezuelan mani- 
festo will be fresh in the minds of most readers, 
and it will be remembered how courageously 
" The Evening Post " faced the hysterical jin- 
goism evoked by that indefensible act, voicing 
with no uncertain sound the sober sense of the 
intelligent in that hour of popular madness. 
Here is a part of what Mr. Godkin writes of 
that unfortunate episode : 

" I was curious to know what was to be said for this 
extraordinary step, and, on the chance of finding some 
argument in its favor in the newspapers, I directed cut- 
tings to be sent to me by Romeike for a month after 
the explosion. I can say, with literal truth, that, among 
the hundreds of extracts I received, I did not find a 
single discussion of the matter. What I did find was 
principally personal abuse of myself, and abuse of the 
kind which one usually hears in bar-rooms or on tenement- 
house stairs. About the highest point reached in it was 
a story that, every day after the work of the ' Evening 
Post ' office was over, I called the staff together, and 
we sang ' God Save the Queen ' in chorus. It was 
startling to fiad that, in a grave crisis, this was the 
way the American press discharged its duties to its 
public." 

The humor of this discussion for it has a 
humorous aspect is supplied by the fact that 
only a few years previously the same editor 
had been assailed with equal violence because 
he sympathized with the Parnellite agitation, 
and for that reason had been roundly denounced 
as a Fenian and " an enemy of the British 
Empire." 

The one thing which our modern politicians 
cannot understand is the attitude of a man 
whose activities are based upon fixed principles, 
which he is unwilling to change at the behest 
of a frantic popular demand. The shifty pol- 
itician, with his " ear-to-the-ground " princi- 
ple of action, has become so predominant a 
type in our own day that the statesman who 
really means what he says, dealing sincerely 
and manfully with his constituents, is com- 
monly regarded with curiosity, as a survival 
of an outworn way of thinking. Mr. Godkin 
says : 

" I have never become reconciled to the practice of 
telling your constituents that if they do not like your 
sentiments they can be changed. The change, for 
instance, with regard to England has been startling in 
its suddenness. It occurred about ten o'clock on a sum- 
mer morning. As a good American, it had for many 
years been my duty to bring on a war with England if 
I could, and kill as many Englishmen and damage as 
much property as possible. On the day in question I 



received notice to be friendly with England, without 
being told why. Even war, which I had been abhorring 
for twenty years as the amusement of pampered nobles, 
I now found myself obliged to cherish and foster, as 
the mother's best friend. I also learned from my friend 
Capt. Mahan that without a few forts and islands and 
strong places, which somebody else wanted to take away 
from us, our old men would go down in sorrow to the 
grave. I sincerely hope that there may not be many 
more changes in my lifetime. Few persons are able 
to stand the rack which this nation has gone through 
within thirty years, without damage to their moral con- 
stitution. No man can maintain that black is white 
without straining some vital organ." 

And yet there must still be many serious men 
to whom our modern chameleon-statesmanship, 
which subdues every honest instinct to the base 
uses of partisanship, remains a thing of horror, 
and who would rally eagerly about any leader 
who could be trusted to think for himself, and 
act in accordance with his convictions. And 
from many souls in this opportunist age must 
be reechoed the Tennysonian call : 

" For a man with heart, head, hand, 
Like some of the simple great ones gone 
For ever and ever by, 
One still strong man in a blatant land, 
Whatever they call him, what care I, 
Aristocrat, democrat, autocrat one 
Who can rule and dare not lie." 

Concerning the great change that has come 
over American journalism during the past 
generation, Mr. Godkin is in a position to offer 
expert testimony. The original offender seems 
to have been the elder Bennett, and we are 
given this convincing diagnosis of his case : 

" Bennett found there was more journalistic money to 
be made in recording the gossip that interested bar- 
rooms, work-shops, race-courses, and tenement-houses, 
than in consulting the tastes of drawing-rooms and 
libraries. He introduced, too, an absolutely new fea- 
ture, which has had, perhaps, the greatest success of 
all. I mean the plan of treating everything and every- 
body as somewhat of a joke, and the knowledge of every- 
thing about him, including his family affairs, as some- 
thing to which the public is entitled. This was 
immensely taking in the world in which he sought to 
make his way. It has since been adopted by other 
papers, and it always pays. . . . Even crime and pun- 
ishment have received a touch of the comic. I used to 
hear, at the time of which I write, that Bennett's editors 
all sat in stalls, in one large room, while he walked up 
and down in the morning distributing their parts for 
the day. To one he would say, 'Pitch into Greeley'; 
to another, 'Give Raymond hell'; and so on. The re- 
sult probably was that the efforts of Greeley and Ray- 
mond for the elevation of mankind on that particular 
day were made futile." 

There is much food for reflection in the jnore 
general paragraph that follows : 

" The steady growth of the Bennett type of journal- 
ism, which has ever since continued, and its effects on

politics and morals, are now at last patent. In all the 
free countries of the world, France, America, and Italy, 
though in a less degree in England, it constitutes the 
great puzzle of contemporary political philosophy. It 
is ever substituting fleeting popular passion for sound 
policy and wise statesmanship. Democratic philosophers 
and optimistic clergymen are naturally unwilling to 
admit that the modern press is what the modern demo- 
cratic peoples call for, and try to make out that it is 
the work of a few wicked newspaper publishers. But 
the solemn truth is that it is a display of the ordinary 
working of supply and demand. Consequently, all dis- 
cussions of the evils of the press usually end either in a 
call for more Bible- reading in the schools, or in general 
despair." 

Mr. Godkin tells us how lie imbibed his 
political philosophy from the English liberalism 
of the fifties, when Mill and Grote and Ben- 
tham were names with which to conjure. 

" At that period, in England and Ireland, at least, 
political economy was taught as a real science, which 
consisted simply in the knowledge of what man, as an 
exchanging and producing animal, would do, if let alone. 
On that you can base a science, for the mark of a sci- 
ence is, that it enables you to predict. Since then, what 
is called political economy has become something en- 
tirely different. It has assumed the role of an adviser, 
who teaches man to make himself more comfortable 
through the help of his government, and has no more 
claim to be a science than philanthropy, or what is called 
sociology." 

His constant warfare against war, which has 
been so conspicuous a feature of his editorial 
activity, received its impulse from actual con- 
tact with the fighting of the fifties on the 
Danube and in the Crimea. It does not take 
the sight of many battlefields to range a man of 
ordinary sensibilities against warfare, or to put 
him in a position to make effective protest 
against the sophistries by which the practice is 
defended. One battlefield is described for us, 
and the description leads to the following com- 
ment : 

" This, and the scenes in the trenches through which 
I passed that day, gave me a disgust for war which, 
during the forty years that have since elapsed, I have 
never ceased to express whenever an opportunity offered. 
The doctrine of the inheritance of qualities, which now 
plays so large a part in the discussions of modern pub- 
licists concerning the course of history, inevitably sug- 
gests that the fighting instinct which lies latent in the 
breasts of even the most civilized peoples, must be a 
legacy from countless generations of remote ancestors, 
who, even after the dawn of consciousness, must have 
followed rapine and the murder of strangers as their 
daily occupation. It is in these things in reality that 
war consists, in spite of the efforts of the more civilized 
nations to disguise it by fine names, and to get God 
mixed up in it. The passion for it, and interest in it, 
felt by even the more cultivated members of the human 
race, could hardly be as strong as they still are had they 
not been infused into the blood by countless generations 
of savage forefathers. It is a most humiliating thought 



that man is the only animal that rejoices in the destruc- 
tion of its fellows." 

This is plain sober truth, and against it no hot- 
blooded orator, pleading with whatever rhetor- 
ical skill he may for the claims of the " stren- 
uous " life, can possibly win his cause in the 
forum of morals. 

We have done little more than hint at the 
extraordinary interest of Mr. Godkin's auto- 
biographical notes. They ought to be repub- 
lished in some less ephemeral form, and if the 
writer could be persuaded to expand them into 
a running commentary upon the history of the 
last half-century, while preserving the personal 
flavor which gives them so peculiar an interest, 
we have no hesitation in saying that the book 
thus produced would be one of the most val- 
uable that could possibly be written. It would 
be a book of sound economics, of acute politi- 
cal criticism, and of ethical weight. It would, 
moreover, preserve for the next generation the 
image of a man who has done much for his 
own, and who deserves the most grateful re- 
membrance from the citizens of his adopted 
country. 



MISSPELLING AND MORALS. 



We learn with much regret that the Congregation 
of the University of Chicago, a semi-legislative 
body, has cast a small majority of votes in favor of 
the adoption, in the University publications, of cer- 
tain eccentric spellings among which " thru " and 
" program " are typically objectionable examples. 
This sort of petty tinkering with the English lan- 
guage is absolutely futile, to begin with, and it 
creates an amount of irritation among cultivated 
persons which seems altogether out of proportion to 
the exciting cause, yet which is real enough to react 
harmfully upon those responsible for the ill-advised 
innovation. A university is supposed to be a centre 
of good taste and ripe culture ; this exhibition of 
bad taste and crude culture, as far as it becomes 
known to the general public, cannot fail to injure 
the University of Chicago. As an example of a 
good jest forever, we note that the argument made 
by the leading advocate of this " reform " was based 
chiefly upon a quite original theory of the sinister 
effect which the practice of our historical spelling 
has upon the character. In other words, the habit 
of writing " through," for example, creates a pre- 
disposition to moral obliquity which may result in 
making burglars and confidence men of children 
who would otherwise lead upright lives. To such 
straits are the advocates of '' spelling reform " re- 
duced when called upon to give reasons for the faith 
that is in them.

THE RISE AXD FALL, or MAHDISM.* 



We have been agreeably disappointed in Mr. 
Winston Churchill's rather bulky volumes on 
the reconquest of the Soudan. Knowing that 
the author had accompanied the Sirdar's expe- 
dition to Khartoum partly as a press corre- 
spondent, we were prepared to find in them 
merely an elaborately garnished rechauffe of 
his letters from the front. Passages from those 
letters, it is true, are reproduced passim in the 
chapters detailing military operations which 
the writer saw and shared in as an officer in 
the Twenty-first Lancers, and these have the 
merit which the writer claims for them of re- 
flecting the actual impressions of exciting scenes 
and events. But the letters by no means form 
the substance or the more valuable portion of 
the text. 

Mr. Churchill's book is a sober and pains- 
taking attempt to write, fully and impartially, 
and in the light of the best information obtain- 
able, the history of the rise, decline, and fall 
of Mahdism. In order that the reader may 
understand and fairly judge this singular and 
by no means indefensible and purely fanatical 
movement, and grasp the significance of the 
more recent and familiar events flowing from 
it, the author has prefixed to his main narra- 
tive a general survey of the history, population, 
and geography of the Egyptian Soudan. This 
summary, which contains a sketch of the 
Prophet and his lieutenant and successor the 
Khalifa Abdullahi, an account of the origin, 
spread, character, and triumph of Mahdism, of 
the Dervish- Abyssinian war, of Gordon's ill- 
starred mission to Khartoum, etc., occupies 
five chapters, which we venture to say the un- 
military reader will regard as the most inter- 
esting in the book. At any rate, we must 
warmly commend the liberal and impartial 
spirit, and the dignified yet spirited style, in 
which they are written. Chapter V. is devoted 
to the years of Anglo-Egyptian preparation 
which resulted in the transformation of the 
once worthless and derided Egyptian " army " 
into an effective sword of reconquest which, in 
the iron hand of Lord Kitchener, was to do 
such awful, if perhaps in the long run not 
insalutary, work at Omdurman. That the seed

of civilization must at times be watered pretty 
freely by the blood of barbarism, seems, if we 
are to trust history, to be a fact a painful 
one enough. 

Chapters VI., VII., and VIII. relate the 
beginnings of hostilities, the demonstrations on 
the frontier, the taking of Firket, the recovery 
of the Dongola province. With chapter IX. 
the main thread of the narrative of the River 
War proper is taken up. We are, of course, 
unable to vouch for the technical accuracy 
of Mr. Churchill's account of the Soudan 
campaign, but that he has been at great pains 
to secure it is evident. The graphic force of 
his descriptions of the several engagements 
with the Dervishes is undeniable ; and we take 
pleasure in saying that his brilliant account of 
the battle (if one may so term it) of Omdur- 
man is commendably free from the spirit of 
national vainglory, and from the jaunty affec- 
tation of soldierly callousness to the horrors and 
perils of the battlefield that disfigures the pages 
of several of his literary predecessors. Mr. 
Churchill recognizes the fact that it was with 
the vanquished, rather than with the victors, at 
Omdurman that the palm of valor lay ; and he 
concludes : 

" But when all this has been said, the mind turns with 
disgust from the spectacle of unequal slaughter. The 
name of the battle, blazoned on the colors, preserves for 
future generations the memory of a successful expedi- 
tion. Regiments may exult in the part they played. 
Military experts may draw instruction from the sur- 
prising demonstration of the power of modern weapons. 
But the individual soldier will carry from the field only 
a very transient satisfaction, and the ' glory of Omdur- 
man ' will seem to anyone who may five years hence read 
this book a very absurd expression." 

Such moderation as this may well mollify the 
critic who might otherwise take a malicious 
satisfaction in pointing out how signally the 
bubble of British military prestige blown in 
the Soudan has now been pricked by the em- 
battled farmers of the Transvaal. 

To the Fashoda incident the author devotes 
a temperate and well-considered chapter. The 
work concludes with a thoughtful general view 
of the field already traversed in detail, and 
some interesting observations are offered touch- 
ing the present condition and needs of the 
Soudan, and its possible future. The several 
Appendices will chiefly interest the military 
reader. 

A word now as to Mahdism. The Soudanese 
are of many tribes, but there are two main 
races : the aboriginal natives, or negroes as 
black as coal, and the Arab immigrants, who

since the military invasion of the second cen- 
tury of the Mohammedan era have been filter- 
ing into the country, and spreading everywhere 
their blood, religion, language, and ideas. The 
negroes are the more numerous, but the Arabs 
form the dominant race. Between these ex- 
treme types every degree of mixture is to be 
found ; and in the districts to the north a long 
period of interbreeding has formed a mongrel 
but distinct race, which is neither negro nor 
Arab, but a debased blend of the racial char- 
acteristics of both. It is needless to say that 
the Arab not only thus commingled with his 
black neighbors and turned them to the faith 
of Islam, but hunted and harried them and 
sold them into slavery. Slave-hunting was the 
great curse of the Soudan, the source of the 
wealth of the rich and powerful Sheikhs of 
men like Zubair, Africa's premier slave-dealer, 
the " abandoned ruffian " whose aid in 1884 
the " Christian hero " Gordon, backed by the 
British representative in Egypt and by every- 
body else with a competent knowledge of local 
conditions, craved, and the Gladstone Ministry, 
with a fatal and short-sighted purism, spurned. 
To the curse of slave-hunting was added that 
of ceaseless intertribal war ; and in 1819 
Egypt, determining to avail herself of the dis- 
orders in the regions to the south, sent an army 
of conquest up the Nile, under Mahomet Ali. 
Organized resistance to the invader was impos- 
sible ; and to the old darkness of barbarism 
and internal chaos succeeded the black night 
of Egyptian misrule. The rapacious Pashas 
and their cruel and worthless army of forty 
thousand men settled like locusts upon the 
already impoverished land, and its few green 
oases speedily became bare and desolate places 
like the rest. The substance of the country 
was drained away to support the imperial pleas- 
ures of the Khedives and their corrupt procon- 
suls. " The government of the Egyptians," 
wrote Gordon in 1879, " in those far-off coun- 
tries is nothing else but one of brigandage of 
the very worst description." The ability of the 
tribes to meet fiscal extortion depended mainly 
on their success as slave-hunters. When there 
had been a good " catch," they could pay ; 
when not, they were harried by the Imperial 
troops, their scanty means of subsistance were 
wrung from them, and their women were 
drafted away to the harems of the Pashas.* 
The fact that the Egyptian government, nom- 

* " In one district the commander of the troops was carry- 
ing off not only the flocks and herds of the natives, but their 
young girls." (Gordon.) 



inally a member of the International League 
against the slave trade, was indirectly its main 
supporter and beneficiary, dawned upon the 
European Powers ; and in 1874 the Khedive 
Ismail was forced to appoint Gordon Governor 
of the Equatorial Province. Then for the first 
time the Soudanese saw the face of Justice. 
Gordon broke the league of the slave-dealers, 
and at the end of 1879 left the Soudan. His 
reforms had sown the seed of revolution. The 
Soudanese, embittered by the abominations of 
Egyptian misrule, had now caught a glimpse 
of the possibility of better things. Perhaps 
they had an inkling, too, of the inherent feeble- 
ness of the force" that had so long held them 
down. As separate tribal units, they were ripe 
for revolt ; but to the success of a revolt some 
principle of general cohesion, some common 
enthusiasm, some dominant cynosural personal- 
ity to whom all would spontaneously look for 
light and leadership, was essential. With the 
necessity came the idea, and the man. 

The Shuki belief, prevalent in Nubia, fore- 
told the advent, in a day of special shame and 
trouble, of a second great Prophet a Mahdi 
who should lead the people nearer God and 
restore the ghostly and temporal empire of 
Islam. Thus, the tribes of the Soudan had 
been long used to look in anxious inquiry to 
any ascetic of special repute for sanctity, as to 
the Promised One, when the fame of a certain 
holy man, Mohammed Ahmed of Dongola, 
began, about the period of Gordon's departure, 
to fill the land. Men spoke of his pious aus- 
terities, of his reforming zeal, of his fiery ex- 
hortations to the faithful and his bold denun- 
ciation of the lax practice of his spiritual chief, 
of his gifts to the poor, who loudly acclaimed 
him as " Zahed," or renouncer of carnal joys 
and material cravings. Pilgrims from afar 
began to resort to his sequestered retreat, a 
cave hollowed out in the mud bank of the Nile 
where he spent his days in prayer and fasting. 
As his fame grew, and the possibilities of his 
hold upon the imagination of his countrymen 
dawned upon him, Mohammed Ahmed emerged 
from his seclusion and began his apostolate 
among the more distant tribes. He journeyed 
preaching through Kordofan, and received the 
homage of priesthood and people. In fine, by 
the year 1881 the high repute of Mohammed 
Ahmed had ripened into a widespread popular 
conviction (which he took care to foster and 
which he may even have partially shared) that 
he was none other than the mystic Expected 
One, the inspired Mahdi whose mission it was 



42 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



to purify Islam and lift the Egyptian yoke 
from the neck of the people. To Mohammed 
Ahmed there latterly joined himself a crafty 
and experienced secular adherent and shrewd 
political adviser, Abdullahi, the future Khalifa. 
" The two formed a strong combination. The Maluli 
for such Mohammed Ahmed had already announced 
himself brought the wild enthusiasm of religion, the 
glamor of a stainless life, and the influence of supersti- 
tion into the movement. But if he was the soul of the 
plot, Abdullahi was the brain. He was the man of the 
world, the practical politician, the general." 

Then began and ripened apace the great 
conspiracy which resulted in defeat after defeat 
of the effete soldiery of the Khedive at the 
hands of the devoted tribesmen, and eventually 
in the Egyptian evacuation of the Soudan. 
With such dramatic and bloody intervening 
episodes as the rout of Hicks Pasha and the 
fate of Gordon, every reader is familiar. What 
is now important to note is that the often mis- 
judged and misrepresented movement called 
Mahdism was not essentially and originally a 
mere wild wave of religious fanaticism worked 
up by an impostor, but the righteous revolt of 
an oppressed people of "a people rightly 
struggling to be free " against the corrupt 
rule of an alien tyrant. Says Mr. Churchill : 

" Looking at the question from a purely political 
standpoint, we may say that upon the whole there ex- 
ists no record of a better case for rebellion than that 
which presented itself to the Soudanese." 

There was, it is plain, a blend of wild and 
cruel religious fanaticism in the Mahdist up- 
rising, a tincture of imposture in the ways of 
its Prophet. But the revolt was primarily a 
political and perfectly justifiable one, and its 
leader was, as we believe, essentially a patriot. 
Let us be just to Mohammed Ahmed, who 
acted in the main conscientiously according to 
his lights, and who in the day of sore national 
need and distress lit in the breasts of his scat- 
tered and discordant fellow-countrymen a com- 
mon flame of patriotic and religious enthusiasm 
that swept them as a resistless unit against the 
general foe. We find little difficulty in agree- 
ing with Mr. Churchill that, 

" If in future years prosperity should come to the peo- 
ples of the Upper Nile, and learning and happiness fol- 
low in its train, then the first Arab historian who shall 
investigate the annals of that new nation will not forget, 
foremost among the heroes of his race, to write the 
name of Mohammed Ahmed." 

The Mahdi did not long live to enjoy his tri- 
umphs. A few months after the completion of 
his campaigns, the God, as Mr. Churchill poetic- 
ally puts it, " whom he had served, not unfaith- 
fully, and who had given him whatever he asked, 



required of Mohammed Ahmed his soul." 
Then ensued in the land he had purged of the 
Egyptians the grinding tyranny of the Khalifa, 
of all the military dominations which have 
cursed the earth probably, the author thinks, 
" the worst." For nearly thirteen years the 
country endured an oppression as grievous as 
that of the Pashas ; but the despotism was indi- 
genous, it had a color of legitimacy, and the 
people, while they suffered and dwindled, ac- 
quiesced. Left to themselves, they might in 
time have evolved a semblance of a well-ordered 
state. It is optimistic to think so. But the 
process of evolution must have been a slow and 
painful one. As fate willed it, they were 
roughly thrust by an alien hand into a short 
cut to the ways of civilization. The Peace of 
England reigns in the Soudan ; as in the days 
of Gordon, the Soudanese sees the face of Jus- 
tice. Deploring the necessity of a cruel means 
to a good end, one may still find it for the best 
that the Dervish Empire went down in blood 
and irretrievable ruin at Omdurman.

the English historians of South Africa shows 
Great Britain to be as hopelessly inept in

tion upon reading the extended list of policies

republics and the great British Empire. The 
second subject for thought lies in the unsus- 
pected points of contact revealed between the 
history of these republics in Africa and the his- 
tory of the republic to which we owe our duty 
in America. The Dutch in the Transvaal are 
the Dutch of the New Netherland, and the 
French of the Transvaal are the Huguenots of 
the Jerseys ; their religion is the Puritanism 
of New England and of the Dutch Reformed 
Churches of New York ; their government is 
avowedly based upon the Constitution of the 
United States ; even the war of 1778, in which 
the Dutch lost their title to the Cape, was brought 
on largely by the treaty of amity entered into 
between Amsterdam and the revolted provinces 
of North America, and the British occupation of 
Natal in 1842 was in part due to the rumored 
occupation of the port of Durban by the Amer- 
icans. The third reflection is the sorrowful 
one that England's success here, inevitable 
when the potentialities of the two republics and 
the great empire are considered, is to be brought 
about through a war which was the sole result 
of greed and criminal aggression, and when 
attained will be such a blow to the civilization 
which demands Christian morality and right- 
dealing between nations as between individuals, 
such a striking down of government by consent 
and the rearing in its stead of government by 
force, as the modern world has not seen since 
the partition of Poland. And, finally, since 
the Dutch are in the great majority in South 
Africa and are increasing relatively, while the 
British are in the minority and are decreasing, 
when victory is at last attained it must stand 
for one of two things : either Great Britain 
must grant constitutional government to coun- 
tries in which the Dutch are dominant, which 
means that her victory is fruitless ; or Great 
Britain, the exponent of popular freedom, must 
rule an unwilling white majority by force, with 
the object-lesson of Ireland before her eyes. 
In either event civilization suffers, as Anglo- 
Saxons ought to understand the word. 

The first and most inclusive of these recent 
books is the fourth volume of " A Historical 
Geography of the British Colonies," by Mr. 
C. P. Lucas, devoted to South and East Africa. 
It is a brief academic treatment of the subject, 
written from a strictly British point of view, 
but with great impartiality. There is little re- 
flection, and that in the nature of a formal com- 
parison between the British and the ancient 
Roman empires ; while the space devoted to 
the historical section does not permit any en- 



tering into minute detail. A second part of 
the book is geographical, useful for the statis- 
tician and student of current events in British 
territory, but limited to the colonies under the 
British flag. Writing fully three years ago, 
Mr. Lucas proves himself wiser than his gov- 
ernment and its military authorities, in such 
sentences as this : 

" To students of military history, South Africa has 
something to tell. The moral to be drawn from the 
record of South African fighting is that it is not well 
to go out in all the approved panoply of European war- 
fare against those who are armed with simple or with 
savage weapons. We read anew in South Africa the 
story of David and Goliath, and learn that if Goliath had 
gone out with something akin to the sling and the stone, 
he would have done better than when clad in his full 
suit of armour." 

And the essence of the matter is in this, bear- 
ing in mind that Britain has involved herself 
in all her present difficulties in the face of re- 
peated warnings from the loyal people of the 
Cape and of Natal : 

" Where there are still the remains of savagery, 
where the old is very tenacious and the new very ag- 
gressive, where a great dominion and a nation are in 
making, with diverse elements in diverse stages, it is 
not only foolish to interpret men and events in the light 
of our own firesides, it is untrue to the facts and there- 
fore wrong. It is not so much England or the English 
Government that has made South Africa, as the men 
on the spot, the English and the Dutch, who have lived 
and worked in and for the land, who have seen the 
things whereof we read in Blue Books or newspapers, 
not in a glass darkly but face to face." 

The author of " The Story of the Great Boer 
Trek," the late Hon. Henry Cloete, was Her 
Majesty's High Commissioner to Natal, and 
the latter part of his book tells of the manner 
in which the British took possession of that 
territory after distinctly refusing it, and after 
the Boers had made existence in it possible by 
conquest of the savage blacks who had kept 
the present owners of the country out. The 
first three of the five chapters of the book, 
however, are devoted to the causes which led 
to the general emigration of the Dutch, gener- 
ally known as the Great Trek, and the conse- 
quent foundation of the South African Repub- 
lic and the Orange Free State. They gain in 
importance from being lectures delivered soon 
after the event before a mixed audience of 
Dutch and English in South Africa, by a per- 
son who had official connection with the sub- 
jects on which he discoursed. It is hardly 
necessary to go into the details of a matter 
already sixty-four years old, but it may be said 
that Cloete has no scruple in holding the Brit- 
ish Colonial Office guilty of stupendous blun-

ders, in (1) depriving the settlers of their 
Hottentot servants, to the detriment of both 
themselves, the Hottentots, and the country ; 
(2) in taking away their slaves without any 
pretense at adequate compensation though 
that had been promised and at the beginning 
of harvest, throwing many families into abject 
poverty ; and (3) in actually upholding the 
savage blacks in their repeated forays upon the 
Dutch farmers on the frontier. 

Dr. Scholes's large book, " The British Em- 
pire and Alliances," is far better described by 
its sub-title, " Britain's Duty to Her Colonies 
and Subject Races." Indeed, the only " alli- 
ances " mentioned are the natural ties of a 
common language and a common tradition ex- 
isting between the various branches of the so- 
called English-speaking race. This occupies 
the first chapter of the large octavo. After 
this, the colonies of the British empire are 
taken up and described successfully, with con- 
siderations of the wars and the commerce and 
industries which have led to their establish- 
ment. Russia, as England's one rival, is dealt 
with, and with unusual sympathy and discrimin- 
ation. China follows, as a field wherein Britain 
and Russia are to display their various talents 
for organization, with a long essay upon the 
possibilities of the situation. This brings Dr. 
Scholes to a fearless and much needed denun- 
ciation of the white people in the lands where 
they come in contact with peoples of a darker 
skin, the Americans of the Southern United 
States as well as the English in India and 
South Africa, for what he asserts to be nothing 
less than a preposterous assumption of supe- 
riority. He arrays the long line of races dom- 
inant in the civilization of the earth to show 
that some of these were African, when Europe 
was still savage, and to call attention to the 
brief time which has gone by since barbarians 
burst forth from the northern forests, to become, 
by contact with older and cultured peoples, the 
dominant race of Europe and themselves cul- 
tured in their turn. He argues that there is 
nothing in the present status of the African 
Negro, as compared with his Caucasian neigh- 
bor and fellow-countryman in America or the 
British colonies, which differentiates him from 
the German as compared with the Roman of 
Tacitus ; and in the Anglo-Saxon supercilious- 
ness and lack of human sympathy he sees an 
element of weakness which must lead to event- 
ual overthrow. Dr. Scholes goes even further 
than this, at one point and another in his book, 
and demands of Europe and Europeanized 



America what it is that they have to offer to 
these nations of a darker skin. He draws a 
picture in lurid colors, but without exaggera- 
tion, when he describes the present situation 
thus : 

" But amid the precepts of peace and love inculcated 
by theology; the justice and self-sacrifice produced by 
it in the character of European nations; the security of 
law; the refinement of art; the culture of literature; 
the victories of science ; and the ease, the comfort, and 
the splendor of commerce; it remains an indisputable 
fact that, in jealousy, in avarice, in enmity, in the prod- 
igal waste of treasure, and in the still more appalling 
waste of life, through bitter and incessant war, Chris- 
tian and cultured Europe is not one whit behind the 
darkest and bloodiest of the other continents. Nor was 
human blood through war shed more freely under 
Europe heathen, than under Europe Christian; neither 
has it been shed less in the name of religion than in the 
name of politics; nor does the present promise less of 
these calamities in the future, than has been contributed 
by the past; for, as the promoters and abettors, leaders 
in science, in art, in merchandise, and in politics; men 
of birth, men of distinction, men of affluence, all give 
their wealth, their skill, and their influence, to equip 
and to support millions of men, to build thousands of 
battleships, to manufacture terrible missiles and horrible 
explosives, all for the slaughter of one another." 

In conclusion, the author begs America to ab- 
stain from joining herself to these powers which 
are thus rushing on to inevitable destruction ; 
and implores England to abjure further expan- 
sion, and find peace and room for all her ener- 
gies in concentration and consolidation. 

Removed from this earnest and philosophical 
work by a whole heaven, Mrs. Lionel Phillips, 
wife of the leader of that Reform Committee in 
Johannesburg which is so largely responsible 
for much of the present horrors of war, sets 
down her " South African Recollections " with 
a candor which is little less than libellous in 
places and wholly refreshing at all times. She 
writes of the exploit of t)r. Jameson as the 
foolhardy insubordination of a reckless and 
culpably ignorant adventurer, guilty, among 
other surprising follies, of carrying with him 
the proofs of his own guilt and the guilt of his 
fellow-conspirators, among whom her husband 
was chief. She shows that Jameson deliber- 
ately suppressed the orders from the Reform 
Committee not to advance, in order to shift the 
consequences of his disobedience from his 
shoulders to theirs. And she does a great deal 
more when she openly states that the English- 
men in the Rand who were claiming the right 
of expatriation were doing it at the behest of 
the British authorities, though the armed revo- 
lution in Johannesburg was to be effected under 
the Transvaal flag ! When Mr. Lionel Phillips, 
Colonel Rhodes (brother to the Right Hon. 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



45 



Cecil Rhodes), and the others of the Beform 
Committee, were arrested for treason and con- 
demned to death, it is small wonder that the 
burghers felt that the tragedy of Slachters Nek 
in 1816 was being repeated with the nationali- 
ties of the actors reversed, and brought forward 
the very beam upon which their countrymen 
had been hanged for the very same offence 
against British authority. But President 
Krueger was more merciful, and the tragedy 
would have ended as a comedy had England 
not failed in her duty to the Transvaal, to her- 
self, and to civilization, in the Jameson verdict. 
No one can be in doubt, after reading Mrs. 
Phillip's entertaining book, that the Boer is 
not the pleasantest person for the Briton to 
deal with. Thoroughly convinced that the wife 
of one of the chief sufferers from Dutch obsti- 
nacy can be quite dispassionate in her estimate 
of the burgher character, she inadvertently 
points out that the present trouble, the trouble 
in which her husband was involved, and all the 
other troubles between the British and Dutch 
in South Africa, are due to a single cause 
the very Anglo-Saxon superciliousness of which 
Dr. Scholes makes complaint in respect of the 
dark-skinned races. No one, after reading all 
that Mrs. Phillips has to say, can doubt that 
the whole case against the Transvaal is bound 
up in the English taking the desperate efforts 
which the Transvaal was making for national 
existence, and the unusual measures she was 
compelled to adopt for self-protection, to repre- 
sent the real national life of the republic. Lack 
of sympathy and comprehension is only too 
common between diverse nationalities, and both 
the British and Dutch are reprehensible ; but 
assuredly the chief blame does not fall upon the 
shoulders of the weaker, the less cultured, and 
the aggrieved. If the civilization of the English- 
speaking peoples stands for anything, it should 
have for its motto some such sentiment as civ- 
ilisation oblige. 

Of the same sort is the book, " Side Lights 
on South Africa," from the pen of Miss Roy 
Devereux. The author, though falling within 
the sphere of influence of the Right Hon. Cecil 
Rhodes, to whom she accords an ungrudging 
hero-worship throughout the volume, is sincere 
enough to disclose many of the facts that are 
not usually brought forward, notwithstanding 
her intensely British point of view. The dyna- 
mite concession, of which so much has been 
said, is in the hands of the great Nobel trust, 
for example. The heavy taxation on food pro- 
ducts, which is so large a cause of dissatisfac- 



tion among the Uitlanders in the Transvaal, is 
also customary in Rhodesia : Miss Devereux 
might have added, too, that the taxation upon 
the gold mines of the Transvaal is no higher 
than the taxation in Rhodesia. Nor does she 
mention the fact that the high cost of European 
provisions in Johannesburg is due quite as much 
to the tariff exactions of Natal and the Cape 
Colony as to those of the South African Re- 
public. But we cannot be too grateful for the 
quotations from the leaders among the Reform 
Committee in the Transvaal, which prove that 
the Englishmen, after all, had no desire for the 
franchise, quoting, with the rest, Mr. Lionel 
Phillips to Mr. Beit, when he writes : " I may 
say that, as you of course know, I have no de- 
sire for political rights, and believe as a whole 
that the community [of Johannesburg] is not 
ambitious in this respect." Most of Miss 
Devereux's proofs that government is impos- 
sible to the Boer, have a curiously familiar 
sound to American ears. Johannesburg appears 
to be badly misgoverned, especially in respect 
of the liquor laws : for all the world like New 
York or Chicago. There is a denial of political 
rights to foreigners which can be matched by 
our conduct toward the Chinese or our colored 
fellow-citizens in the South. There are African 
outrages to add to the similarity. The Trans- 
vaal legislature appears to be amenable to 
bribery, which brings to mind several of the 
Northern Senators of the United States, the 
respectable bribers being, of course, there as 
here, quite free from the stigma of blame which 
attaches to the less culpable bribed. Every 
third burgher is said to receive aid from the 
state, remindful of the American pension sys- 
tem and the assertions of the protectionists. 
Miss Devereux does not go into the question of 
military efficiency as proof or disproof of Boer 
civilization, though Dr. Scholes shows that 
to be the most highly developed phase of it 
in Europe. Nor does she point out that the 
attitude of England stands without approval 
from any party in any civilized country in the 
world, with the exception of the American 
imperialists, who find in it the best justifica- 
tion of our attitude in the Philippines : a bit 
of international brotherliness which the British 
Tory cordially reciprocates. Her book abounds 
in information, set forth in the sprightly 
style which the name of " lady- journalist " 
suggests. 

For the American desirous of familiarizing 
himself with the merits of the two parties in 
the present war, the essays which make up the 



46 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



small book called, " Briton and Boer, Both 
Sides of the South African Question," reprinted 
from the " North American Review," may be 
recommended, with the preliminary statement 
that the case made out in the book is convinc- 
ingly strong against the Briton. Whether the 
historian and publicist, the Right Hon. James 
Bryce, is talking of matters in which he has a 
peculiar right to be heard as the leading au- 
thority upon a question to which he gave his 
distinguished consideration several years ago ; 
whether Mr. Sydney Brooks is setting forth 
with some attempt at dispassion the elements 
in the controversy from both points of view ; 
whether " A Diplomat " is calling Mr. Brooks 
to account for what he points out to be over- 
statements in favor of Great Britain ; whether 
Dr. F. V. Engelenburg is summing up the 
arguments of his countrymen in the Transvaal, 
or Mr. Karl Blind is speaking as the devoted 
friend of the England to which he owes so 
much ; whether Mr. Andrew Carnegie voices 
the thoughts of the American \n England, or 
Mr. Francis Charmes the thought of a Euro- 
pean on the Continent, or Mr. Demetrius C. 
Boulger the thought of the Continent as inter- 
preted by an Englishman long resident there, 
or M. Max Nordau speaks as a disinterested 
cosmopolitan, all unite in calling this war an 
act of colossal folly on England's part, of bad 
faith and worse management, of criminal ag- 
gression in a word, a high crime against 
civilization. Some quotations from these dis- 
tinguished gentlemen will prove instructive. 
Mr. Bryce, whose attitude as a member of the 
British Parliament is necessarily one of re- 
serve, says: 

" There is not, so far as one can ascertain from any 
evidence yet produced, the slightest foundation for the 
allegation, so assiduously propagated in England, that 
there was any general conspiracy of the Colonial Dutch, 
or that there existed the smallest risk of any unpro- 
voked attack by them, or by the Free State, or by the 
Transvaal itself, upon the powers of England." 

" The Boers very naturally felt that if they had re- 
mained quiet till the British forces had been raised to 
a strength they could not hope to resist, they would lose 
the only military advantage they possessed. Accord- 
ingly, when they knew that the Reserves were being 
called out in England, and that an army corps was to 
be sent to South Africa, they declared war, having been 
for some time previously convinced, wrongly or rightly, 
that the British government had resolved to coerce 
them. They were in a sore strait, and they took the 
course which must have been expected from them, and 
indeed the only course which brave men, who were not 
going to make any further concessions, could have 
taken." 

" No one, of course, denies that the war iu which 



England will, of course, prevail, is a terrible calamity 
for South Africa, and will permanently embitter the 
relations of Dutch and English there. To some of us it 
appears a calamity for England also, since it is likely 
to alienate, perhaps for generations to come, the bulk 
of the white population in one of her most important 
self-governing colonies. It may, indeed, possibly mean 
for her the ultimate loss of South Africa." 

" A Diplomat " raises some interesting ques- 
tions in the direction of national righteousness. 
He says, among other things : 

"The whole Transvaal issue hinges on one question: 
Have the Boers the right to govern themselves as they 
choose; or, rather, have the English the right to inter- 
fere with the form of government, administration, and 
life that the Boers have chosen for themselves ? . . . 
From being applied only to the savage populations of 
Africa and Asia, the principle of the rights of superior 
races and civilizations has come, by a steep incline, to 
mean also that it has reference to countries like the 
Celestial Empire and the Boer Republic. Between the 
Zulus and the Boers, what is the difference ? Ouly one 
of degree. Fine reasoning clears the way for the per- 
petration of any outrage on the liberty and sovereignty 
of minor or weak States." 

" If the Transvaal State is against the development 
of commerce and industry on principle, it is within its 
rights to be so, as much as the United States iu adopt- 
ing the McKinley and Diugley tariffs. . . . The so- 
called prostitution of the law courts to the whims of 
the legislature, does not apply to the ordinary dealings 
of justice in the Transvaal, but to the political situa- 
tion, which, as we have explained, must be governed by 
the principle of the safety of the State." 

And Mr. Karl Blind strikes at a blunder which 
has given to many Americans a wrong concep- 
tion of the entire rights of the case, when he says: 
" And here I feel compelled to declare that violence 
is capped by unbearable cant when the hard-driven 
Republics, around whom the steel net was daily drawn 
tighter, are charged with having brought on this hideous 
war. You drive a man, forsooth, into a corner. You 
hold your fist before his face. You threaten him by 
saying that the sand of the hour-glass is running out, 
and that, unless he makes haste to kneel down, you will 
use other measures against him. You hold your sword 
and gun ready to attack him; and then when he strikes 
a blow, he is, of course, the guilty party ! " 

It only remains to add, for those who hold that 
England here stands for civilization, that she 
is acting neither for her own good nor for 
the good of those whom she attacks, which 
divests her act of all semblance of righteous- 
ness, but is rather impelled by that mammon 
which cannot be served and God be served ; 
while the war itself is a denial of the rights of 
arbitration as of all rights of the weak against 
the strong, and is notice to the world that Great 
Britain, having failed to rule through love, is 
determined to rule by force. If this is Anglo- 
Saxon civilization, the less the world has of it 
the better. WALLACE RICE.

TREES, BROOKS, AND BOOKS.* 

If we accept Emerson's definition of the poet 
as one who has the power to see the miraculous 
in the common, then " Jess, Bits of Wayside 
Gospel " is true poet-work, although address- 
ing the eye in pages of prose. To the average 
man, vacations taken on horseback with Chi- 
cago as the starting-point, and over country 
roads with little of picturesque and nothing of 
romantic or historic interest, would seem hope- 
lessly barren both in the doing and in the tell- 
ing thereof. But not so when Mr. Jenkin Lloyd 
Jones is the traveller. Well known in the 
pulpit and on the lecture platform for his sym- 
pathy, his eloquence, his unique and vivid "art 
of putting things," these same qualities are at 
their best in describing his experiences in the 
saddle or by the roadside or in some humble 
home where he found food or shelter. 

The place of honor in these sketches, and 
the place of honor in the author's heart, is given 
to the bonny horse " Jess." It is a beautiful 
idyl of friendship between man and beast, and 
when the noble creature "goes down to pain and 
death in her over-sympathetic youth, dying like 
some quadrepedal Keats, from too much life," 
her requiem is sung in words as sincere as they 
are touching. 

" The trees and the flowers, the shaded roadside, the 
happy cattle in the clover fields, the morning song of 
the birds, the searching and far-reaching cry of the 
whip-poor-will, the busy, kind human folk, are still left 
for me in my summer haunts, but I shall ever miss that 
silent companionship that for four summers went with 
me over the hills and dales of Wisconsin, through the 
haunts of busy men, into the solitudes of busier nature. 
Jess, my companion of many hundreds of miles of happy 
travel, will accompany me no more in my quest for 
bodily strength, mental clearness, and spiritual peace. 
Her elastic step will not disturb the morning dew; her 
dainty ear will not catch the noonday hum of the reaper; 
her alert eye will not scan the evening horizon with 
unfeigned anxiety to find the big barn or the country 
hamlet that would give us the hearty meal and well- 
earned slumber of the night. Something has gone 
out of those hills and valleys, out of the world, never 
to return. But Jess abides, at least in one heart made 
more open to fellowship, more tender to suffering, and 
more quick to feel the woes of all sentient beings." 

These sketches being first written and deliv- 
ered as sermons to a Chicago audience, there 
is a decided personal touch felt in all of them. 
But this adds to the interest rather than de- 
tracts from it, as the reader follows the author, 
beholding in him such happy fulfilment of the

Hillis. Chicago : Fleming H. Revell Co. 



old text, "Speak to the earth, and it shall 
teach thee." 

Quite a different book, but one also made 
up of sermons first delivered to a Chicago au- 
dience, is " Great Books as Life Teachers," by 
the Rev. N. D. Hillis. Accepting the fact that 
our generation reads poems, essays, and novels, 
rather than text-books on ethics and morals, 
the author argues that this indicates, not a de- 
cline of interest in fundamental principles 
of right living, but a desire to study these 
principles as they are embodied in living prob- 
lems. Fiction being increasingly the medium 
of amusement and instruction, the great poets 
and essayists having become the prophets of a 
new social order, the preacher takes up in turn 
some of the modern writers in these fields, to 
show that they are consciously or unconsciously 
teachers of morals, that their books are essen- 
tially books of aspiration and spiritual culture. 
John Ruskin, George Eliot, Hawthorne, Victor 
Hugo, Tennyson, and Browning are some of 
the authors to whom Mr. Hillis turns to find 
help for those who would live in the spirit. 
There is no great degree of originality in the 
line of thought or in the conclusions of these 
essays ; but the author has a pleasant and pic- 
turesque style, and a happy gift in the use of 
illustration and comparison that save the book 
from triteness and make it " popular " without 
being trivial. Nearly every subject is treated 
with regard to its relation to other subjects, the 
niches being assigned with ingenuity and often 
with much fitness. For example, a study of 
" Romola " begins thus : 

" After eighteen centuries, the most popular story in 
literature is Christ's story of the prodigal son, a story 
that has fascinated the generations, softened the races, 
and will yet win a wandering world back to its Father's 
side. If the Bible, with its parables, is the book best 
loved by men, next to it stands Pilgrim's Progress,' 
more widely read than any other human book. If 
1 Les Miserables ' exhibits the evolution of conscience, 
' Wilhelm Meister ' the evolution of intellect, and The 
Scarlet Letter ' the evolution of pain and penalty, the 
theme of Romola ' is the evolution of sin, the peril of 
tampering with conscience and the gradual deterioration 
of character." 

Books like the two foregoing show how far 
the modern sermon departs from the old type. 
The earnest and devout preacher to-day keeps 
himself in touch with the interests and thoughts 
of the passing hour. The old-time sermon 
commonly was either an exposition of dogma or 
an exhortation to prepare for the life beyond 
the grave. The modern sermon concerns itself 
with the purpose to make the most of life here 
and now, for ourselves and for others. To this

end, the texts are taken not from one book alone

RECENT POETRY.* 



Mr. Swinburne breaks a longer silence than usual 
with the publication of his new tragedy in verse. 
It is now three years since his last volume, " The 
Tale of Balen," was given to the world, and the 
fact is painfully suggestive of that slackening of the 
energies that comes with advancing years. For 
this poet, the greatest that remains to us, is fast 
becoming the most venerable also, and we are re- 
minded that his song will not again gush forth with 
the opulent flow of the past. There already stand 
to his account upwards of a score of volumes of the 
noblest poetry to which the English tongue has 
given utterance ; the singer now may well rest con- 
tent with his renown, and with the solitary eminence 
which he has achieved. Whatever further gifts he 
may bestow upon us can add little to the fresh ver- 
dure of his laurel-crown. Yet such a gift as " Rosa- 
mund, Queen of the Lombards " is no mean addi- 
tion to our treasury. It is a creation of beauty far 
beyond the reach of any other man now living, and 
provides the year just ended with its one book 
which we may be certain will remain a permanent 
addition to our literature. The framework of this 
tragedy may be found in Gibbon. It is the story 
of that Rosamund, daughter of the Gepidae, who

espoused Alboin, the slayer of her father. This 
founder of the Lombard kingdom fell by the hand 
of an assassin, whose deed was instigated by the 
treachery of the queen, taking thus a long-delayed 
vengeance for her father's death. The grim tale 
was peculiarly fitted to be dealt with by Mr. Swin- 
burne, who has invested it with all the pity, terror, 
and tragic irony which it demands. One cannot 
help recalling that another Rosamund was the 
heroine of Mr. Swinburne's first dramatic work of 
what was practically his first poem. The two pieces 
are thus separated by nearly forty years, and a 
comparison between them would prove highly in- 
structive concerning the development of the poet's 
style. This we may not here attempt in full, but 
certain points of contrast should be indicated, for 
which purpose the following extracts will suffice. 
Here speaks the " Rosamund " of 1861 : 
" Fear is a cushion for the feet of love, 
Painted with colors for his ease-taking ; 
Sweet red, and white with wasted blood, and blue 
Most flower-like, and the summer-spoused green 
And sea-betrothed soft purple and burnt black. 
All colored forms of fear, omen, and change, 
Sick prophecy and rumors lame at heel, 
Anticipations and astrologies, 
Perilous inscription and recorded note, 
All these are covered in the skirt of love, 
And when he shakes it these are tumbled forth, 
Beaten and blown i' the dusty face of the air." 

From the " Rosamund " of 1899 we select this pas- 

ROSAMUND. 

" Kiss me. Who knows how long the lord of life 
May spare us time for kissing ? Life and love 
Are less than change and death. 

ALBOVINE. 

" What ghosts are they ? 
So sweet thou never wast to me before. 
The woman that is God the God that is 
Woman the sovereign of the soul of man, 
Our father's Freia, Venus crowned in Rome, 
Has lent my love her girdle ; but her lips 
Have robbed the red rose of its heart, and left 
No glory for the flower beyond all flowers 
To bid the spring be glad of." 

Here is a contrast indeed ! The exuberance, the 
color, the overwrought imagery, the verbal afflu- 
ence, the Shakespearian diction, of the earlier work 
have vanished, and in their place we have sheer 
simplicity of vocabulary, passion intimated rather 
than expressed, imagery reduced to bare metaphor, 
and a diction wellnigh shorn of all mannerisms. 
Noting the vocabulary alone, we find in the later 
passage only half as many words of more than one 
syllable as are found in the earlier extract. Here 
is a still more striking example of the reduction of 
vocabulary to its lowest terms : 

" I take thine oath. I bid not thee take heed 
That I or thou or each of us at once, 
Couldst thou play false, may die : I bid thee think 
Thy bride will die, shamed. Swear me not again 
She shall not : all our trust is set on thee. 
What eyes and ears are keen about us here 
Thou knowest not. Love, my love and thine for her, 
Shall deafen and shall blind them." 

Here are seventy-four words, of which seventy-one 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



are monosyllables. Mr. Swinburne has often been 
charged with a lack of restraint. There is some 
justice in the charge, although far too much has 
been made of it. But whatever may be said of his 
early exuberance, the poem now before us gives 
evidence that he can upon occasion carry restraint 
to its extreme. The new " Rosamund " does not 
readily lend itself to quotation. It is too com- 
pressed, too tense, too dependent upon the dramatic 
situation for illustration by detached fragments. 
The following passage is as quotable as any : 

"Thy voice was honey-hearted music, sweet 
As wine and glad as clarions : not in battle 
Might men have more of joy than I to hear it 
And feel delight dance in my heart and laugh 
Too loud for hearing save its own. Thou rose, 
Why did God give thee more than all thy kin 
Whose pride is perfume only and colour, this ? 
Music ? No rose hut mine sings, and the birds 
Hush all their hearts to hearken." 

The high restraint which characterizes the diction 
of this drama extends also, by implication, to the 
demeanor, to the very gesture, of the actors con- 
cerned. The brooding storm of passion is felt, 
rather than heard or seen, but we are not unpre- 
pared for the supreme moment in which it breaks. 
The inevitable fate of both king and queen is so 
foreshadowed that when it comes upon them in one 
swift last moment of the action, the spirit is not so 
much aroused as calmed, and we echo the words 
with which, as with the final chorus of a Greek 
tragedy, the outcome is characterized in this single 
verse, 

" Let none make moan. This doom is none of man's." 
Among the younger English poets whose ranks 
we scan when we would know if there be any to 
take the places of the great Victorian singers Mr. 
Stephen Phillips seems to hold out a greater prom- 
ise than any of his compeers. There are some 
critics who, should the poet of " Rosamund " be 
taken from us, would at once raise the cry, " Le 
roy est mort. Vive le roy ! " and would mean by 
that the transferrence of their allegiance to the poet 
of "Paolo and Francesca." It is something of a 
coincidence that these two noteworthy pieces of dra- 
matic verse should have appeared almost simulta- 
neously, and that the youngest of our poets should 
find his name linked thus fortuitously with that of 
our oldest. There is something pleasant to con- 
template in the generous enthusiasm which has 
greeted the work of Mr. Phillips, but a new poet 
is proclaimed in similar fashion every year or two, 
and, remembering many other cases of the same 
sort, the critic who looks before and after will not 
allow his judgment to be stampeded. We have a 
high opinion of the quality of Mr. Phillips's work ; 
parts of it are very fine indeed, and none of the 
younger men exhibit greater promise than is exhib- 
ited by the author of " Marpessa " and " Paolo and 
Francesca." But Mr. Phillips has thus far failed 
to strike a new note. The initial volumes of Ten- 
nyson and Browning and Arnold and Morris and 
Rossetti did strike new notes, and forced a read- 



justment of ideals. The first volume of the " Poems 
and Ballads " struck a new note so startling in its 
sonority that those who heard it have hardly yet 
recovered from the shock. But Mr. Phillips has 
thus far done excellent things only in the manner 
of other poets who have preceded him. His " Paolo 
and Francesca " is a beautiful piece of workman- 
ship, but its beauty comes to us enforced by its asso- 
ciations with the most exquisite episodes of the 
" Divine Comedy," and even with the reflection of 
that episode in the tragedy of Silvio Pellico. The 
poem does not possess a new beauty of its very own. 
It reaches its climax in the scene which approaches 
most closely to its original, the scene of the lovers 
seated together, and reading of " Launcelot how 
love constrained him." It runs as follows : 

PAOLO (reading) . 

" 'Now on that day it chanced that Launcelot, 
Thinking to find the King, found Guenevere 
Alone ; and when he saw her whom he loved ; 
Whom he had met too late, yet loved the more ; 
Such was the tumult at his heart that he 
Could speak not, for her husband was his friend, 
His dear familiar friend : and they two held 
No secret from each other until now ; 
But were like brothers born ' my voice breaks off. 
Read you a little on. 

FKANCESCA (reading). 

' And Guenevere, 

Turning, beheld him suddenly whom she 
Loved in her thought, and even from that hour 
When first she saw him ; for by day, by night, 
Though lying by her husband's side, did she 
Weary for Launcelot, and knew full well 
How ill that love, and yet that love how deep ! ' 
I cannot see the page is dim : read you. 

PAOLO (reading). 

* Now they two were alone, yet could not speak ; 
But heard the beating of each other's hearts. 
He knew himself a traitor but to stay, 
Yet could not stir : she pale and yet more pale 
Grew till she could no more, but smiled on him. 
Then when he saw that wished smile, he came 
Near to her and still near, and trembled ; then 
Her lips all trembling kissed.' 

FBANCESCA (drooping towards him). 

Ah, Launcelot! " 
(He kisses her on the lips.) 

The above is only a diluted restatement of Dante. 

In the following words, placed upon the lips of Paolo, 

Mr. Phillips comes as near to speaking in his own 

voice as the subject will permit. 

" What can we fear, we two ? 
God, Thou seest us Thy creatures bound 
Together by that law which holds the stars 
In palpitating cosmic passion bright ; 
By which the very sun enthrals the earth, 
And all the waves of the world faint to the moon. 
Even by such attraction we two rush 
Together through the everlasting years. 
Us, then, whose only pain can be to part, 
How wilt Thou punish ? For what ecstasy 
Together to be blown about the globe ! 
What rapture in perpetual fire to burn 
Together ! where we are is endless fire. 
There centuries shall in a moment pass, 
And all the cycles in one hour elapse ! 
Still, still together, even when faints Thy sun, 
And past our souls Thy stars like ashes fall, 
How wilt Thou punish us who cannot part ? "

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



It remains to state that the drama by Mr. Phillips 
is intended for actual performance, and will be pro- 
duced at an early date by Mr. George Alexander. 
It is a promising sign of the times when a literary 
production of this high order of merit finds accept- 
ance at the hands of practically minded theatrical 
folk. 

In turning from these noble works to " Deluscar's 
Merris and Other Poems " we turn from poetry to 
bathos and from the exalted to the commonplace. 
The volume is a stout one, but a dreary waste to 
the seeker after beauty. To this writer the modern 
world is decidedly out of joint. He discourses of 
it through many pages in the following strain : 

" Oh ! how it sickens me to read the rot 
About those ancient Greek and Eoman frauds ! 
One of our men could tie ten in a knot, 
Out-art their cleverest, choicest sculptured gauds. 
Here, if it paid, new Shakespeares would arise 
In his time fortunes were by poets made ; 
Now individual merit starving lies, 
Nothing goes down but sordid, swindling trade." 

Although our writer affects the form of the Shake- 
spearian sonnet, it is quite clear that he is no new 
Shakespeare arisen. 

There are noticeable technical defects in the 
" Laurel Leaves" of Mr. Robert Wilson. The entire 
octave of one sonnet is built upon the theory that 
the second syllable of Beethoven bears the accent ; 
quantity is ignored in 

"The grand matutinal anthem when the sphere 
Was first upon its orbit hurled along," 

and an excellent memorial tribute is ruined by the 
closing verse, 

"Thou noble type of Christian ladyhood." 
But in spite of such faults as these, the total im- 
pression is pleasing, although the verse is of a sort 
that almost any cultivated person might have writ- 
ten. The following sonnet ' To My Wife " may be 
selected for our quotation. 

" There came upon my soul a sacred awe 
When first I won thy maiden tenderness ; 
My very heart arose in me to bless 

All that on earth or sea or air I saw, 

And dear to me is still the breath I draw 

Through that blest moment, nor is love the less 
For all our mingled joy and bitterness 

Since first we lived beneath its holy law. 

Two little graves are side by side on earth ; 

Two little stars are added to our skies ; 
And children's voices ring around our hearth ; 

And Love, reflected from their kindred eyes, 
First Love, springs up again in second birth 

And steals the golden key of paradise." 

Mr. Wilson's poems are mainly impressions of 
travel and memorial verses. Among the latter, there 
is a notable group of sonnets in which the author 
expresses his love and reverence for Dr. Martineau, 
to whom the book is dedicated " in memorial of a 
friendship which has been the consecration of my 
life and of its poetic aspirations. " 

Mr. Owen Seaman's new collection of parodies 
and other humorous pieces, while not quite equal in 
brilliancy to " The Battle of the Bays," does not 



fall far behind that inimitable volume. He is almost 
entitled to wear the mantle of C. S. C., and that 
is saying much. Mr. Austin, Mr. Meredith, Mr. 
Phillips, and Mr. Swinburne are among the victims 
of his good-natured jesting. Which of them is 
aimed at in the following stanza we do not need to 
specify : 

" For the Silly Season is past and over, 

Gone with the equinoctial gales ; 
That sinuous hoax, the hoar sea-rover, 

Curbs the pride of his prancing scales ; 
And the giant gooseberry misbegotten 
Lies in the limbs of all things rotten, 
The savour that clings to last year's clover, 
The loves that follow the light that fails." 

Nor do we need to name the poet parodied in the 
ode apropos of the affaire which closes thus : 

" Like sails of a galleon, rudder hard amort 
With crepitant mast 

Fronting the hazard to dare of a dual blast 
The intern and the extern, blizzards both." 

This, written for an Omar Khayyam Club dinner, 
is also rather good : 

" Master, in memory of that Verse of Thine, 
And of Thy rather pretty taste in Wine, 
We gather at this jaded Century's end. 
Our Cheeks, if so we may, to incarnadine. 

"Thou hast the kind of Halo which outstays 
Most other Genii's. Though a Laureate's bays 

Should slowly crumple up, Thou livest on, 
Having survived a certain Paraphrase. 

" The Lion and the Alligator squat 
In Dervish Courts the Weather being hot 
Under Umbrellas. Where is Mahmud now ? 
Plucked by the Kitchener and gone to Pot." 

We have the usual contribution of Canadian 
verse to our present garnering of recent poetry, 
three volumes being easily entitled to mention. The 
first of them shall be Mr. Wilfrid Campbell's " From 
the Hills of Dream." What we like particularly 
about most of these singers from over the border is 
their deep sense of natural beauty, their joyous 
fellowship with woods and meadows, with mountains 
and skies. Few of our own poets have these qual- 
ities in like degree with Messrs. Roberts and Car- 
man and Scott and Campbell, or with the late 
Archibald Lampman. They offer us an interpre- 
tation of nature which, vivid in its realism, is yet 
intensely spiritualized. How etching-like in its line 
is such a picture as this : 

"I thread the uplands where the wind's footfalls 
Stir leaves in gusty hollows, autumn's urns. 
Seaward the river's shining breast expands, 
High in the windy pines a lone crow calls, 
And far below some patient ploughman turns 
His great black furrow over steaming lands." 

The poem on " September in the Laurentian Hills " 
will serve further to illustrate our thesis: 

" Already Winter in his sombre round, 

Before his time hath touched these hills austere 
With lonely flame. Last night, without a sound. 

The ghostly frost walked out by wood and mere. 
And now the sumach curls his frond of fire, 

The aspen-tree reluctant drops his gold, 
And down the gullies the North's wild vibrant lyre 

Rouses the bitter armies of the cold. 



1900.]

" O'er this short afternoon the night draws down. 

With ominous chill, across these regions bleak ; 
Wind-beaten gold, the sunset fades around 

The purple loneliness of crag and peak, 
Leaving the world an iron house wherein 
Nor love nor life nor hope hath ever been." 

Equally lovely, although in a far different fashion, 

is the following tender lyric : 

" Love came at dawn when all the world was fair, 

When crimson glories, bloom, and song were rife ; 
Love came at dawn when hope's wings fanned the air 

And murmured, ' I am life.' 

"Love came at even when the day was done, 

When heart and brain were tired, and slumber pressed ; 
Love came at eve, shut out the sinking sun, 
And whispered, ' I am rest.' " 

Many of Mr. Campbell's poems are of more ambi- 
tious flight than those we have quoted, but he finds 
his truest inspiration in simple scenes and themes. 
His volume is one to be treasured for its beauty and 
elevated feeling. 

Mr. Bliss Carman has sought alien shores, even 
those of the Bahamas, for the inspiration of " A 
Winter Holiday." The book is of the thinnest, and 
counts only seven numbers in its contents. South 
Sea islands are pleasant things to think about at 
this season of the year, and such lines as these are 
certainly enticing : 

" Through the lemon-trees at leisure a tiny olive bird 
Moves all day long and utters his wise assuring word ; 
While up in their blue chantry murmur the solemn palms, 
At their litanies of joyance, their ancient ceaseless psalms. 

" There in the endless sunlight, within the surf's low sound, 
Peace tarries for a lifetime at doorways unrenowned ; 
And a velvet air goes breathing across the sea-girt land, 
Till the sense begins to waken and the soul to understand." 

This is pretty, at least, but it is nothing to what 
Mr. Carman has done in the past, or what we still 
hope he may accomplish in the future. 

Mr. Carman, it is generally known, is a cousin of 
Mr. C. G. D. Roberts, who occupies the foremost 
place in the group of young Canadian poets. What 
is not generally known, however, is that poetical 
talent is the common inheritance of all the Roberts 
family. The volume of " Northland Lyrics," now 
before us, gives convincing evidence of this propo- 
sition, for it is the joint work of one sister and two 
brothers of Mr. C. G. D. Roberts. " Beyond the Hills" 
is a poem by Mrs. Elizabeth Roberts Macdonald. 

" The daffodils fling far the flag of Spring, 

Their golden troop the garden-fortress fills, 
And bird-throat bugles greet the days that bring 

The daffodils. 
" Over the hills the Summer comes at last ; 

But sad the light and sad the laughing rills, 
And sad the golden flowers since he has passed 
Beyond the hills." 

Mr. Theodore Roberts is the author of a "Lament " 
inscribed to the memory of Archibald Lampman. 
We quote the first half of this poem : 

" His was not the glory of the shattering of spears ; 
He did not cross his sword with Death, where scarlet flags 

are hurled, 
But Death came to him softly, with his dark eyes dim with 

tears, 
And broke a dream of woodland-ways across a singing world. 



"So doff your hats, good poet-men, 
No fingers lift the fallen pen ! 
The sun forgets to mark the time 
Without the music of his rhyme." 

Finally, Mr. William Carman Roberts bids us select 
from upwards of a score of his pieces these two 
stanzas of the lyric, " At the Heart's Cry ": 

"Till the black-crimson petals of that night 
Drew down to the gold vortex of strange dreams 
My soul and body, wearied of the fight 
Of far ideals and clashing fierce desires, 
I was as one struck blind by life's sweet light 
And deafened by a myriad singing fires. 

"So was I glad when night's deep velvet rose 
Closed over me and hid me from myself ; 
As on my northern hills the first soft snows 
From grey skies brooding like an angel's wing, 
Compassionate, where the last lorn maple glows, 
Blot out all sad remembrances of Spring." 

These three lovely poems are fairly illustrative of 
their fellows. The collection as a whole is a really 
astonishing exhibition of talent, fine feeling, and 
melodious utterance. It has a foreword in verse by 
the brother, and an afterword by the cousin, of the 
three new poets. 

After a silence of several years, Mr. G. E. Wood- 
berry has published a second volume of verse. But 
" The North Shore Watch " hardly led us to antici- 
pate "Wild Eden." There was in the earlier vol- 
ume a manner of severe restraint, almost of aus- 
terity, and this is replaced in the later one by a 
wilding note and an outpouring of melodious rapture 
so free that a new poet seems to address us rather 
than the old one. The charm of these songs is as 
great as it is indefinable. Something of the dewy 
freshness of the Elizabethan music seems to be re- 
echoed in these exquisite lyrics, and yet the modern 
touch la maladie de lapensee is too evident to 
make this illusion more than fleeting. But whether 
the art be old or new, it is well-nigh perfect when 
it finds such expression as " The Secret." 

"Nightingales warble about it 

All night under blossom and star ; 
The wild swan is dying without it, 

And the eagle cryeth afar ; 
The sun, he doth mount but to find it, 

Searching the green earth o'er ; 
But more doth a man's heart mind it 

O more, more, more ! 

" Over the gray leagues of ocean 

The infinite yearneth alone ; 
The forests with wandering emotion 

The thing they know not intone ; 
Creation arose but to see it, 

A million lamps in the blue ; 
But a lover, he shall be it, 

If one sweet maid is true." 

This is pure song touched with imagination. The 
imaginative element is still finer and more marked 
in such a poem as " The Sea-Shell," of which we 
quote the closing stanza : 

" mystic Love ! that so can take 
The bright world in thy hands, 
And its imprisoned spirits make 
Murmur at thy commands ;

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



As if, in truth, this orb of law 

Were but thy reed-hung nest, 
Woven by Time of sticks and straw 

To house the summer guest ; 
And so to me the starry sphere 

Is but love's frail sea-shell ; 
0, might she press it to her ear, 

What would its murmurs tell ! " 

Mr. Woodberry's inspiration is his own, as far as 
this is possible in the case of a writer whose thought 
is steeped in the work of the older poets. That it 
should be absolutely unsuggestive of his predecessors 
would be too much to expect. So we are not sur- 
prised to find familiar cadences here and there, the 
Tennysonian cadence, for example, in these lines : 
"O, hidden-strange as on dew-heavy lawns 

The warm dark scents of summer-fragrant dawns ; 

O, tender as the faint sea-changes are, 

When grows the Sush and pales the snow-white star ; 

So strange, so tender, to a maid is love." 

" Seaward," the long poem which closes the volume, 
is the one most suggestive of a model, or at least of 
a recollection. Its first line, 

" I will go down to the hoar sea's infinite foam," 
instantly brings to mind Mr. Swinburne's 

" I will go back to the great sweet mother, 
Mother and lover of men, the sea." 

Again and again the suggestion recurs, now of " The 
Triumph of Time," now of the " Hymn to Proser- 
pine," now of " Hesperia." We find it here, 
" Of the flush of the bough, of the fragrance of woods, of 

the moan of the dove 
Weary and weary of passion and thrice, thrice weary of 

love!" 
And here, 
"I will seek thy blessed shelter, deep bosom of sun and 

storm, 
From the fever and fret of the earth and the things that debase 

and deform ; 

For I am thine, from of old thou didst lay me, a child, at rest 
In thy cradle of many waters, and gav'st to my hunger thy 

breast." 

And yet again here, as the end of the poem is ap- 
proached, 
"Man-grown, I will seek thy healing; though from worse 

than death I fly. 

Not mine the heart of the craven, not here I mean to die I 
Let me taste on my lips thy salt, let me live with the sun and 

the rain, 
Let me lean to the rolling wave and feel me a man again." 

But these suggestions do not mar our enjoyment of 
" Seaward," which is a very beautiful poem, and, if 
it could not hope to catch all the music of " Hes- 
peria," it has music enough to remain ringing in 
our ears as the volume is reluctantly closed and put 
aside. 

Neatness and precision of expression, rather than 
poetical phrasing, are the characteristics of Mr. 
Richard Burton's " Lyrics of Brotherhood," a thin 
volume of mostly short pieces. The following is a 
typical example : 

"A flash of the lightning keen ! 

And lo ! we know that, miles on miles, 
The dim, lost land is lying green. 

It brims our heart with joy, the whiles, 

To see that through the thick night-screen 

Full many a meadow smiles and smiles. 



" A flash from the poet's brain ! 

The meaning of the many years, 
That mazeful seemed, grows very plain ; 

The level lands of gloom and tears 
Hint holy heights, turn bright again ; 

The night a transient thing appears." 

Mr. Burton is always a pleasing and thoughtful 
writer, but philosophy is too apt to usurp the place 
of song in his verse. 

Among the women singers of our country there 
is none whose work gives more satisfaction than that 
of Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton. It is sure to be 
tender in conception and artistic in finish. If Mrs. 
Moulton's instrument be a flute rather than a violin, 
the exquisite purity of its tone is beyond question, 
although it cannot bestow the rich measure of sen- 
suous delight that other instruments afford. The 
best flute music becomes monotonous if we hear too 
much of it at one sitting, and Mrs. Moulton's new 
volume is not one to be read through at a sitting, 
but rather one into which to dip when the mood is 
properly receptive. It is made up of lyrics, sonnets, 
quatrains, and translations. The sonnets have all 
the purity of the other pieces, and some measure of 
richness as well. " At Rest " is a typical example. 

" Shall I lie down to sleep, and see no more 
The splendid pageantry of earth and sky 
The proud procession of the stars sweep by ; 

The white moon sway the sea, and woo the shore ; 

The morning lark to the far Heaven soar ; 

The nightingale with the soft dusk draw nigh ; 
The summer roses bud, and bloom, and die 

Will Life and Life's delight for me be o'er ? 

" Nay ! I shall be, in my low silent home, 
Of all Earth's gracious ministries aware 
Glad with the gladness of the risen day, 
Or gently sad with sadness of the gloam, 
Yet done with striving, and foreclosed of care 
At rest at rest ! What better thing to say ? " 

We must quote also this exquisite translation of the 
French verses to which George Du Maurier gave 
such wide popularity a few years ago. 

" Ah, brief is Life, 

Love's short, sweet way, 
With dreaming 's rife. 
And then Good-day ! 

"And Life is vain 

Hope's vague delight, 
Grief's transient pain, 
And then Good-night ! " 

There is a marked contrast between the volume 
just noticed and Miss Guiney's "The Martyr's Idyl, 
and Shorter Poems." If the tendency of the former 
was toward a sweetness well-nigh cloying and the 
gentle melancholy of subdued utterance, the ten- 
dency of the latter is rather toward heightened 
passion and something like asperity of expression. 
The larger titular poem is a legend from the Acta 
Sanctorum, dramatically told, and concerned with 
a " Virgin Martyr " whose story is not unlike that 
of the Elizabethan tragedy and Mr. Swinburne's 
poem. Among the shorter poems we find nothing 
more quotable than the set of sapphics entitled 
" Charista Musing."

" Moveless, on the marge of a sunny cornfield, 
Rapt in sudden revery while thou standest, 
Like the sheaves, in beautiful Doric yellow 
Clad to the ankle, 

" Oft to thee with delicate hasty footstep 
So I steal, and suffer because I find thee 
Only flown, and only a fallen feather 
Left of ray darling. 

" Give me back thy wakening breath, thy ringlets 
Fragrant as the vine of the bean in blossom, 
And those eyes of violet dusk and daylight 
Under sea-water, 

" Eyes too far away, and too full of longing ! 
Yes : and go not heavenward where I lose thee, 
Go not, go not whither I cannot follow, 
Being but earthly, 

" Willing swallow poised upon my finger, 
Little wild-wing ever from me escaping, 
For the care thou art to me, I thy lover 
Love thee, and fear thee." 

This is charming, but not exactly typical, for Miss 
Guiney's inspiration is mainly spiritual, and religious 
mysticism is the fundamental note of her song. She 
is more truthfully represented by this D.O. M. prayer. 

" All else for use, one only for desire ; 
Thanksgiving for the good, but thirst for Thee : 
Up from the best, whereof no man need tire, 
Impel thou me. 

" Delight is menace, if Thou brood not by, 
Power a quicksand, Fame a gathering jeer. 
Oft as the morn (though none of earth deny 
These three are dear), 

" Wash me of them, that I may be renewed, 
Nor wall in clay my agonies and joys : 

close my hand upon Beatitude ! 
Not on her toys." 

" Out of the Nest," by Miss Mary McNeil Fen- 
ollosa, is a volume of graceful fancies and snatches 
of song, divided about equally between oriental and 
occidental themes. From the former category we 
select this invocation to Fujisan : 

" thou divine, remote, ineffable ! 
Thou cone of visions based on level sea, 
Thou ache of joy in pale eternity, 
Thou gleaming pearl in night's encrusted shell, 
Thou frozen ghost, thou crystal citadel, 
Heart-hushed I gaze, until there seems to be 
Nothing in heaven or earth, but thee and me ; 

1 the faint echo, thou the crystal bell." 

This accumulation of metaphors is rather effective, 
and serves well to illustrate the writer's style. Of 
the occidental pieces (so-called because they are not 
oriental), the verses entitled " Roses " are as pretty 
as any. 

" What shall I send to my sweet to-night ? 
Roses of yellow, or pink, or white ? 

Gold for her smile, and her sunny hair ? 

Pink for the flush that her cheeks will wear ? 

White for her soul, and the secrets there ? 

" Which shall she lay on her breast of snow ? 

Is it a prophecy ? Weal or woe ? 
Yellow for gold, and the world's decree ! 
Pink for a love and its ecstasy ! 
White for the robe of a saint to be ! 

" Strange, how I shrink from the frail design ! 

'Tis but a fancy, a whim of mine. 
Fate does not come at a lover's call, 
To lurk in the rose of a girl's first ball. 
I think I '11 take violets, after all." 



The religious note is dominant in the " Voices " 
of Mrs. Katharine Coolidge (who is, by the way, a 
daughter of Francis Parkman), but their tonic (in 
more senses than one) is a note of joyous acceptance 
of the whole of life, its buffets no less than its favors. 
The very first page sounds this clarion call to the 
soul: 

" Awake ! Fear not the perilled heights of strife 1 

Great love and joy ; strong suffering and sin, 

With strenuous, upreaching vision, rise 

Beyond the veil, lifting us on to win 

Possession of the power that purifies ; 

Flame leaps to flame, and God hath given thee life ! " 

Again we are told that 

" Life to know life must pass through shades of death, 
Night touches day, and near to heaven is hell. 
Sinner or saint then, he who dauntless gives 
His heart's blood to the world, supremely lives." 

And still again we read : 

" Give thanks to Life if thou art tempest-hurled 
Through the abyss to feel the pulsing world ! 
Of joy and pain reborn, thy life shall be, 
The boundless silence compassing the earth, 
The love that blossoms in the springtide's birth, 
The vibrant force of the far-shining sea." 

In other moods, however, the strenuous spiritual 
life that is voiced in the foregoing extracts gives 
place to the plea for quietism, a plea made many 
times in the course of this volume, and not infre- 
quently with the exquisite grace of these lines to 
" Dreamland." 

"0 holy Hypnos, listen to my prayer: 
Touch my closed eyelids with thy magic wand, 
That I may seek far bourns of Lethe's land, 
And find the key of vision hidden there, 
Dreamily drifting through the hazy blue, 
To palaces where all that seems is true. 

" There dwell pure spirits of the forms on earth : 
The whispered secret of the woods at even, 
White flame of stars that glow in highest heaven, 
The arcana of the springtide's wonder-birth ; 
The lily's heart, the rainbow's mystery, 
And the deep anthem of the encircling sea." 

This volume of " Voices " is characterized through- 
out by beautiful expression of the higher spiritual 
sort, as well as by a verse-technique that leaves little 
to be desired. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

In the book entitled " The Puritan as 
a Colonist and Reformer " ( Little, 
Brown, & Co.), Mr. Ezra Hoyt 
Byington delivers a plain and unvarnished account 
of the Puritan in the double capacity indicated. 
This account is appreciative but not extravagant. 
While making it very clear that the Puritan, in 
respect to political, civil, and religious freedom, was 
in advance, and much in advance, of his time, Mr. 
Byington makes it equally plain that he had his 
unpleasant limitations. For example, he introduces 
his account of the treatment of the Quakers and 
Baptists in Massachusetts with this frank admission :

Puritans, we must place their treatment of those

in claiming liberty for themselves, but the majority 
of them were not willing to concede the same lib- 
erty to others." This is the plain fact, and no parad- 
ing of the extravagancies of the Quakers or of the 
Baptists can obscure it. Among the best chapters 
of the book, because the least hackneyed, are those 
on " John Eliot, the Apostle to the Indians," " Jona- 
than Edwards and the Great Awakening," and 
" Shakespeare and the Puritans," the first being the 
best of the three. It gives us a moving picture of 
the heroic effort made by John Eliot and his asso- 
ciates and compeers to Christianize the Indians of 
New England, and the utter failure in which, after 
a period of strong encouragement, the effort ended. 
The " praying Indians " never recovered from the 
effects of King Philip's War, in which they were 
ground between the upper and nether millstones ; 
but there is, we fear, small reason to think that the 
result would have been different if that war had 
never been. The chapter on " The Great Awak- 
ening " would be better if there were more of it. 
Some matters should have been included that are 
not. Much, for example, is laid at the door of the 
"half- way covenant," but we are not told what 
the half-way covenant was, and not all of us are 
theological scholars. Then we think the writer 
should have made more of his opportunity to show 
the effect upon practice of fundamental theories in 
connection with native traits of character. He cor- 
rectly attributes much of the irreligion prevailing 
just before the Great Awakening to the extreme 
form of Calvinistic theology that prevailed, but 
there is much more in the matter than he has brought 
out. The chapter on Shakespeare, while in no sense 
profound, will be informing to many readers, and 
interesting to still more. The book is a useful con- 
tribution to the extensive literature of this great 
subject. 

Cromwell at Lieut.-Colonel T. S. Baldock, R.A., 

matter of the furnishes the fifth volume of the 

"Wolseley Series," in his "Crom- 
well as a Soldier " (imported by Scribner). As the 
title indicates, the work is primarily adapted to the 
student of military history, or to the ambitious tac- 
tician ; yet so clear are its accounts of manoeuvers 
even in detail, and so delightful its narrative style, 
that one unfamiliar with military technicalities may 
read it with understanding and interest. Prelim- 
inary to the real matter, however, a brief outline 
of the military organization of England before the 
civil war is given, together with an account of the 
battles antecedent to Cromwell's appearance upon 
the field. The bulk of the work is devoted to a 
careful examination into Cromwell's organization of 
the New Model, and a logical analysis of those ac- 
tions in which he had a personal share. Basing his 
arguments upon his own clear deductions then, 
Colonel Baldock credits Cromwell's victories almost 
solely to his ability as an organizer and tactician : 



a conclusion quite new to readers of the civil war 
historical period. Without exception, the political 
historians of the times lay stress upon the religious 
enthusiasm of the New Model as the cause of vic- 
tories, in which Cromwell's indirect share is due to 
his discovery of the fanatically religious soldier. 
To this, Colonel Baldock says : " Stern fanatics as 
were his troopers, their victories were won, not by 
superior enthusiasm, but by superior organization 
and military training." In support of this, it is 
shown that Cromwell's discipline was extreme, that 
his understanding of correct tactical principles was 
far beyond that of any other man of his time, and 
that the distinct advance made in the efficiency of 
the cavalry arm of the service during the civil war 
was due entirely to the military genius of its com- 
mander-in-chief. The period was, in fact, one in 
which the art of warfare was rapidly changing. The 
professional soldier was disappearing before the 
citizen warrior a patriot who desired the end of 
the war rather than to prolong it. Thus the age 
of maneuvers and of sieges was succeeded by the 
sharp attack and the decisive victory. In this ren- 
aissance period of the art of war, the author regards 
Cromwell as the best exponent of the new method, 
and indeed as an innovator whose real genius in 
war explained his wonderful successes. The reader 
is indebted to Colonel Baldock's work for refresh- 
ing light upon the character as well as the achieve- 
ments of the master spirit of the Commonwealth. 
He learns not alone to appreciate and admire the 
military sagacity of the general, but he cannot help 
an added enthusiasm for the man, whose real great- 
ness in war shows a breadth of mind which makes 
him the less a bigot in religion. 

The charm of bygone manners and 
customs, bygone superstititions, by- 
gone imaginings, and bygone ideals, 
makes a great deal of the pleasure to be had from 
Mr. Clyde Furst's little volume, " A Group of Old 
Authors " (George W. Jacobs & Co.). The five 
separate studies, used before publication as popular 
lectures, concern themselves with John Donne, the 
mediaeval story of Griselda, the voyages of St. 
Brendan and Maelduin, Aldhelrn, and the Beowulf. 
In the first, the author essays the difficult task of 
making his readers realize the poetic qualities of 
the verse of a man of whom the world knows little, 
many-sided genius though he was. Donne the man 
was a stronger figure than Donne the poet, and our 
author's appreciative study does not make our 
interest in his verse more than merely intellectual. 
The second of the articles is a brief retelling of the 
tenth story of the " Decameron," the clerk's tale 
from Chaucer, followed by an account of the vari- 
ous other forms which the story took in the Middle 
Ages. Both Tennyson and Matthew Arnold made 
use of the material of which the next study treats, 
and the legend is of peculiar interest, both because 
of its spread in different forms among European 
peoples, and because of the human feeling of which

it is an expression. It is a story of miraculous ad- 
ventures met with in the search for fabled islands 
of the western seas, symbols of those things toward 
which man's aspiration looks with eternal longing. 
Though they have clearly come from some such 
place, these little studies are all of them free from 
any unpleasant suggestions of the scholar's work- 
room. They will not, perhaps, have a very large 
audience, but so much of the glow and color of old 
times is in them that they might well have. The 
Beowulf story, told in simple nineteenth century 
prose, should interest anyone, and the time is com- 
ing when the legends and myths of our own Anglo- 
Saxon ancestors will be of equal importance in our 
eyes with those of Greece and Rome. Mr. Furst's 
volume is in part an attempt to popularize them, 
and, while dealing with facts and so marshalling 
them as to prepare for scholarly conclusions from 
them, he has been concerned mainly to entertain 
his readers with some things well worth knowing. 
The book should while away a pleasant hour or two, 
and leave the reader a little richer in love and lore 
of old-time poesy and story. 

An argument Though not disguising in the least 
for abandoning the fact that the only reason the 
American ideal,. United States can find for departing 
from its old traditions is a mercenary one, Professor 
Charles Waldstein's volume on " The Expansion of 
Western Ideals " (John Lane) is a labored attempt 
to justify aggression and conquest under the plea 
that the time has come for us to be like Great 
Britain in colonizing localities remote from our own 
national domain. To do this, he is compelled to 
ignore the fact that this country is a democracy, 
and that it has domestic problems of the gravest 
moment wholly unsolved at home, just as he ignores 
the dealings of white Americans through our his- 
tory with the the Indian, the Negro, and the Alas- 
kan native. In exchange for our policy of unen- 
tangled peace, he offers the glittering bauble of an 
alliance with Great Britain, and a " world's peace" 
of which we and our new allies are to be the self- 
constituted guardians. If we fail to do this, we 
are warned that we shall be shut out of the world's 
commerce in after years, nothing being said of 
the shutting of ourselves from the world's commerce 
during a long generation. There are but two forces 
on the earth, Professor Waldstein avers, the British 
and the Russians ; and the time is at hand when 
we, like the Bezonian, must array ourselves under 
one king or the other, must " speak, or die ! " It 
need hardly be said that nothing more is promised 
us than increased commerce, except the possibility 
of our colonial administration becoming so excellent 
that it will drive us at home to better government 
the lesson of the Reconstruction era in the South 
and the recent letting down of the civil service be- 
ing ignored. Finally, it is to be distinctly under- 
stood from the entire book that the " expansion " 
to which the writer would see our " western ideals " 
subjected is the laying off all American ideals and 



substituting for them a complete suit of the British 
ideals to which his long residence in an English 
university has accustomed him. 

The " Letters of Sidney Lanier " 
(Scribner) are arranged in four 
groups, one on musical topics, writ- 
ten to his wife, and the remainder the result of three 
literary friendships. Most of the letters have been 
printed in various magazine articles, but have never 
before appeared as a collection. They furnish data 
of Lanier's life between 1866 and 1881, and evince 
its cheerfulness in the midst of depressing surround- 
ings, and its exquisite response to the best in music 
and in art. The letters to his wife reveal the inmost 
man, as the others do the inner. As the series of 
letters comprising his correspondence with Mr. Pea- 
cock progresses, one reads the story too brief, 
indeed of a friend who could never have been 
disappointing to his earliest avowed appreciator, as 
also it is plain that Mr. Peacock was no disappoint- 
ment to him. Lanier the man shows larger ^han 
Lanier the poet : his delicate sympathy and fine nobil- 
ity of character are here clearly cut as in silhouette. 
The letters bear witness to Lanier's gratitude for 
worthy suggestions, social opportunity, and the 
friendship of other poets, blessings brought within 
his reach by the generous critic-editor. The third 
section of the book gives letters that passed between 
Bayard Taylor and Lanier ; and if the reader here 
feels that the younger poet was giving more, in the 
mutual giving, than his older world-worn friend, 
the wealth of friendship and tender solicitude with 
which Lanier was endowed appear all the more 
clearly. The last group comprises letters to Paul 
Hamilton Hayne, illustrating the warm feeling be- 
tween the two poets, together with Lanier's detailed 
criticism and praise of Hayne's verses, and contain- 
ing the interesting avowal that music, not poetry, 
was the main interest of Lanier's life. Sad as were 
the external facts of Lanier's existence, involving 
poverty, ill health, and anxiety, and unreconciled 
to his early death as many lovers of his work must 
be, one cannot but feel, while reading the record 
these letters give, that here was a man who con- 
quered, who passed out of life a victor. 

In a little volume of delightful inter- 
est, "Jane Austen, Her Contempo- 
raries and Herself" (Longmans), 
Mr. Walter Herries Pollock talks sympathetically 
of Jane Austen, the woman and her art, considered 
with reference to the work of Miss Burney, Miss 
Edgeworth, and Miss Ferrier. The book is a piece 
of discriminating and careful criticism, written in 
an easy conversational vein that only occasionally 
loses its sparkle by a parenthetical or other slipshod 
expression. Perhaps few of us have so great an 
interest in Jane Austen as our author fancies, and 
perhaps, in spite of Scott's encomiums and Macau- 
lay's praise, she is not quite so near to Shakespeare 
as he would have us believe. It is true that more

art is required for the portraying of commonplace 
characters than for the delineation of striking indi- 
vidualities ; but, granting that Miss Austen's char- 
acters are at once commonplace and well-painted, 
must it not occur to the critic, even in this age of 
realism, that an author who presents only people 
already familiar to us is lacking in artistic judg- 
ment? Prose fiction is of interest to us because it 
appeals to our emotions ; but it should also enlarge 
our experience both of persons and places. Modern 
readers are not content to find pleasure in a novel 
by reason of their ability to verify the characters 
through their own memories as they go along. It 
is refreshing, however, to have Mr. Pollock's assur- 
ance that Miss Austen's figures were never photo- 
graphic reproductions, for we are a little tired of 
the camera, and are glad to be reminded that in the 
days of " Pride and Prejudice " the snap-shot was 
unknown. All in all, the book is pleasantly written, 
presents fairly the artistic qualities of Miss Aus- 
ten's work without ignoring her limitations, and 
adds .some very pertinent comment on the relation 
of her writings to those of her contemporaries. 



An expounder The recent publication of Mr. Joel 
ofthepoetry Benton's "In the Poe Circle" has 
of Emenon. brought again into notice his two 
essays on " Emerson as a Poet," originally published 
in 1882, and now reissued (Mansfield & Wessels), 
with the useful selected bibliography brought up to 
date, and with the partial concordance by Mr. Ken- 
nedy. The undertaking to extend the circle of the 
readers of Emerson's poetry is commendable, and 
such critical judgments as the following, permeated 
with the writer's enthusiasm and illustrated with 
liberal quotation from the poems, may well have 
this result. Emerson, like Browning, says the critic, 
is obscure, but his dimness " seems more directly a 
necessary incident, and less an invention." " May 
he not at least be placed along with Browning?" 
The admirer cannot furnish the indifferent with the 
seeing eye and the hearing ear, needed to appre- 
ciate justly " the most pure, aerial and divinely 
souled poetry since Shakespeare's music became 
measured and still." Mr. Benton defends Emer- 
son's alleged technical deficiency, finding beauties 
where others see flaws. Though of Oriental con- 
tent, this poetry is essentially Northern and Gothic, 
and is marked by high majesty and solemnity, even 
by religious sanctity. There is " a constant relation 
to the breadth of some endless horizon." The reader 
need not agree with every dictum of Mr. Benton's ; 
but if he takes Emerson's poems from their shelf 
to read them anew, the critic will have proved his 
inspiration. 

The way of the world is to atone for 
past injustice to genius by raising 
in after generations an altar bearing 
the name of the unappreciated one, who now is 
exalted to god-like proportions. Poe's fame is just 
now experiencing a season of deification. Since the

celebration at the University of Virginia of the 
semi-centennial of the poet's death, nothing is too 
good to be said of him, even though some of the 
saying is ill-judged. Unless the search for exact 
truth which is the distinguishing mark of the present 
age shall disappear, we may hope some day to 
possess a wholly accurate as well as wholly sympa- 
thetic biography of this cloud-enshrouded contem- 
porary, and also (although already Mr. Stedman 
has largely furnished this) an estimate of his work 
which, while sacrificing nothing of the enthusiasm 
due to native ability, shall at the same time shun 
unqualified laudation. Meanwhile we must put up 
with essay-writing that proceeds as if, once for all, 
a man had been found without human limitations. 
Perhaps it is hardly fair thus to introduce Mr. 
Henry Austin's historical and critical commentary, 
accompanying three volumes of the " Raven " edi- 
tion of Poe's selected tales (Fenno). And yet under 
these comments lies the assumption, which rears its 
head high on occasion, that when all is said there 
is no other writer, certainly no other writer of his 
time, worthy of comparison with him who was at 
the same time a Baltimorean and " a Bostonian." 
One suspects the breadth of such a critic's reading, 
as one is made certain of the carelessness of the 
critic's style, despite his facility in making a telling 
phrase. The historical setting of the tales is given 
with frequent suggestiveness, and, after all, pardon 
should be ready for the fault of loving too much. 

Poe's psychology Professor J. P. Fruit has read and 
as studied in re-read the whole of Poe's poetry, 

his poetry. together with what principles of po- 

etic criticism Poe himself has enunciated. He has 
also consulted masters of the critic's art like Pater 
and Coleridge. He has intended to absorb the 
whole of Poe's poetic spirit, and for the time being 
declares that he has shut out all rival authors. If 
it is indeed sufficient to record subjective impres- 
sions, then the author of " The Mind and Art of 
Poe's Poetry" (Barnes) has performed his duty, 
even if he has left something to be desired in defi- 
niteness of impression and, occasionally, in judicial 
discrimination. Surely few would agree that " The 
Bells " is Poe's most nearly perfect poem. In the 
first part of his book Professor Fruit traces the de- 
velopment of Poe's mind in his poetry, which, he 
thinks, is marked by the following stages : First 
was the aim to interest the reader in himself as an 
ill-fated young man of genius, a Platonist yet a pes- 
simist. Then the poet devoted himself to beauty, 
in distrust of the scientific spirit. Next, poetry 
itself was the chief object of his thought ; and thus, 
having become a conscious artist, he produced his 
consummate poem by a chosen method the ono- 
matopoetic. The second part of the book follows 
the poems chronologically once more, with the pur- 
pose of showing Poe's gradual gain in his art, 
involving a penchant for allegory, until "The 
Raven," a masterpiece, is followed by a succession 
of master-strokes, and again " The Bells " crowns

the whole poetic edifice as its capstone. There are 
interesting critical suggestions throughout, and the 
poems are usually placed in their appropriate bio- 
graphical setting. . 

Coi.Higginso*, Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson 
tketches of hit is at his happiest in writing of " Con- 
contemporane,. temporaries" (Houghton). From 
an intimate personal knowledge, he gives us pen- 
pictures of Emerson, Alcott, Parker, Sumner, Phil- 
lips, Grant, and others of the illustrious generation 
of which he is himself one of the younger members 
and of whom so few now remain. Delightful as 
present-day reading, these sketches will be of even 
more value in the future, when the historian gathers 
up his material for a perspective view of the cen- 
tury now closing. His enthusiasm for his great 
contemporaries is always tempered with discrimina- 
tion and a sense of proportion ; he is able to set 
their talents and their limitations frankly side by 
side, and to show the mission and the message which 
distinguished each. The two concluding sketches of 
these nineteen are of more general nature " The 
Eccentricities of Reformers " and " The Road to 
England" but they are quite worthy of the com- 
pany in which they appear. 

Professor Th. Ribot's " Evolution of 
HW general _ General Ideas" (Open Court Pub- 

ideas evolve. ,.-,. /-i \ . 

hshing Co.) is an interesting, stimu- 
lating little book, and shows its author's customary 
clearness of exposition, though sometimes tending 
toward over-simplification. Professor Ribot studies 
herein general ideas as displayed before words by 
animals, children, deaf-mutes, and in gesture lan- 
guage ; he discusses the origin of speech, and treats 
the development of the principal concepts namely, 
number, space, time, cause, law, species. His orig- 
inal contribution to the subject is the account of 
some experiments to determine what passes in the 
mind when general terms are pronounced and under- 
stood the author finding that with one class of 
minds such a word as " law " evokes the image of 
a court ; in another class, the image of the printed 
word ; in another, the image of the spoken word ; 
while in another, nothing appears in the mind. In 
short, this is an interesting and instructive essay, 
and well within the capacity of the general reader. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The plays of Edwin Booth, Shakespearian and mis- 
cellaneous, edited from the actor's prompt-books by 
Mr. William Winter, occupy three volumes which have 
just been put forth by the Penn Publishing Co. The 
Shakespearian plays are eleven in number, and make 
up two of the volumes. The third contains " Richelieu," 
" The Fool's Revenge," " Brutus," " Ruy Bias," and 
" Don Csesar de Bazan." These sixteen plays consti- 
tuted Mr. Booth's customary repertoire, although he 
occasionally produced a number of others. In fact, 
" The Lady of Lyons " and "A New Way to Pay Old 
Debts " seem to belong in such a collection as this. 



The increased attention given of late to cryptogramic 
botany in this country is once more signalized by the 
simultaneous appearance of two volumes devoted to 
the Myxomycetes and their allies. Professor L. M. 
Underwood's volume, entitled "Moulds, Mildews, and 
Mushrooms " (Holt), is the wider in scope, and designed 
for the more elementary, and even popular audience. 
It is a systematic manual, and affords an excellent in- 
troduction to the subject. Professor T. H. Mac Bride's 
volume, called "The North American Slime-Moulds" 
(Macmillan) is a monograph of a higher and even more 
specialized sort, and covers the American Myxomycetes 
more completely than any other existing work. It has 
a number of handsomely- executed plates, and is alto- 
gether creditable to both author and publishers. 

Professor John Lesslie Hall has followed up his trans- 
lation of " Beowulf " with a volume of " Old English 
Idyls " (Ginn), in which the most striking episodes of 
the history of Saxon England are related in alliterative 
unrhymed verse. " I have," says the author, " assumed 
the role of an English gleeman of about A. D. 1000, 
and have sought to reproduce to some extent the spirit, 
the metre, and the leading characteristics of Old English 
verse." These idyls deal with such subjects as Hengist 
and Horsa, Cerdic and Arthur, the coming of Augus- 
tine, and the deeds of Alfred. The author's experi- 
ment seems to us singularly successful, and students of 
early English history and literature alike should be 
grateful to him for his undertaking. 

Mr. Horace White, the veteran journalist, has be- 
guiled the spare hours of his later years by preparing a 
translation of " The Roman History of Appian of Alex- 
andria " (Macmillan), which is published in two band- 
some volumes. Since the work is indispensable for the 
study of Roman history, and the last preceeding English 
translation was made more than two centuries ago, the 
justification for Mr. White's work is apparent. While 
this version is, in a sense, the work of an amateur, it 
has been conscientiously made, and has occupied the 
translator for five years. It has, moreover, had the 
benefit of revision at the hands of a professional clas- 
sical scholar, so that no doubt need be harbored con- 
cerning its accuracy. 

Recent English texts for school use include the fol- 
lowing: "Selections from Landor " (Holt), edited by 
Professor A. G. Newcomer; Shakespeare's " Macbeth " 
(Holt), edited by Professor L. A. Sherman; "Repre- 
sentative Poems of Robert Burns " (Ginn), edited by 
Mr. Charles Lane Hanson; George Eliot's "Silas Mar- 
ner " (Heath), edited by Dr. G. A. Wauchope; four 
books of Pope's Homer (Sanborn), edited by Mr. Philip 
Gentner; "The Sir Roger de Coverley Papers" (Ap- 
pleton), edited by Professors F. T. Baker and Richard 
Jones; "Milton's Shorter Poems and Sonnets" (Apple- 
ton), edited by Mr. Frederick D. Nichols; and Chaucer's 
" Prologue, Knight's Tale, and Nun's Priest's Tale " 
(Houghton), edited by Dr. Frank Jewett Mather, and 
forming two numbers of the " Riverside Literature 
Series." 

The chafing-dish having come to play so prominent 
a part in modern social functions, a liberal repertory 
of feasible dishes is highly desirable. Mrs. Janet 
McKenzie Hill's book of " Salads, Sandwiches, and 
Chafing-dish Dainties " (Little, Brown, & Co.) gives 
many original dishes, thirty-two with illustrations. The 
very attractive form of the book fits it to go along with 
the pretty adjuncts of the chafing-dish supper.

Volumes VIII. and IX. of the " Eversley " Shake- 
speare, edited by Professor C. H. Herford, bring that 
most acceptable edition within one number of its com-

the publishers of this work. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. announce the first Amer- 
ican edition in the original tongue of Hauptmann's 
" Die Versunkene Glocke," edited by Dr. T. S. Baker. 
The firm also states that the 36th edition of " The

charge of this subject. It is a text-book of the modern 
scholarly type, interestingly written, and mechanically

brief sketch and a rather voluminous series of extracts. 
The purpose of the book is " to show to young readers 
what has been the direct line of descent of English 
poetry." 

" The Temple Treasury " (Dutton), in two volumes, is 
"a Biblical diary compiled with references." This 
means that for each day of the year there are two selec- 
tions, representing the Old and New Testaments re- 
spectively, and that marginal indications direct the 
reader to cognate passages found elsewhere in the Scrip- 
tures. The Dent imprint upon these volumes is a war- 
rant for their tastefulness. 

" The Family of the Sun " (Appleton) is a book of 
astronomy for children, by Professor E. S. Holdeu. It 
offers an excellent account of the solar system in simple 
language. The same author has just published, in the 
" American Science Series " (Holt), an " Elementary 
Astronomy," which is condensed from the larger work 
in the same series written some years ago in collabora- 
tion with Professor Simon Newcomb. 

The committee of which Professor Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton is chairman has purchased the library of Romance 
literature once owned by James Russell Lowell, con- 
taining more than 700 volumes, and the collection will be 
taken from Elmwood to the Harvard University Library, 
where it will be known as the Lowell Memorial Library 
of Romance Literature. The funds to purchase the 
books were subscribed in answer to an appeal made last 
February. 

Few Americans of the elder generation will fail to 
recall the song of " The Rain on the Roof," one of the 
most popular pieces of song-verse ever produced in this 
country. Its author, Col. Coates Kinney, has recently 
included this and other familiar pieces in a volume of 
verse issued by Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co., under 
the title " Mists of Fire." Old readers as well as new 
ones will be glad to have this tasteful souvenir of a 
veteran and popular writer. 

" A Guide to the Operas," by Miss Esther Singleton 
(Dodd), gives descriptions of twenty-nine works by 
twelve composers. The descriptions are something more 
than the meagre outlines of plot usually given in such 
works as this, and embody many intelligent hints for 



1900.] 



THE DIAL

the musical comprehension of the works considered. 
The selection is at least practical, for it keeps close to 
the familiar Grau repertoire, and the illustrations are, 
appropriately enough, costumed portraits of the singers 
with whom the public is best acquainted. 

" A Syllabus of Psychology," by Dr. James H. 
Hyslop, and " A Syllabus of an Introduction to Phil- 
osophy," by Dr. Walter T. Marvin, are recent publica- 
tions of Columbia University. While prepared for the 
use of college classes, these syllabi are of wider inter- 
est, presenting, as they do, a conspectus of the two 
subjects concerned in such a way as to prove helpful 
to the general reader. This statement is particularly 
true of Dr. Marvin's work, which is more than a sylla- 
bus, strictly speaking, and has some of the character- 
istics of a treatise upon its subject. 

The latest addition to the " Temple Classics " offers 
a new and welcome departure from what have hitherto 
been the limitations of the series. It is a translation, 
by Mrs. Muriel Press, of the " Laxdale Saga," and other 
sagas are promised if the success of this one shall war- 
rant the undertaking. Since the death of William 
Morris cut short the comprehensive " Saga Library " 
upon which he was engaged, we trust that the work of 
popularizing these Icelandic masterpieces may be car- 
ried on by the editor of the present series. One has 
only to acquire a taste for this sort of reading to want 
as much of it as he can get. 

We hardly think of Matthew Arnold as a poet espe- 
cially in need of the services of the illustrator, but the 
volume of " Poems by Matthew Arnold " (Lane) for 
which Mr. Henry Ospovat has made a series of draw- 
ings, and for which Mr. A. C. Benson has written a 
critical introduction, is a pleasant book to have, and we 
will not quarrel with its idea. The selection of poems 
is such that a pictorial accompaniment is not forced, 
although Arnold would doubtless experience a feeling 
of mild surprise could he view the types of character 
and imaginative construction that his poems have sug- 
gested to the artist of the present volume.

" But for the sacred fire and the illuminating vision, for originality and virility of imaginative power, for gleams 
of the diviner charm and tenderness which belong to and are inseparable from impassioned strength, Mr. Phillips' work 
has stood, to my thinking at least, alone in its generation." SIDNEY COLVIN in The Nineteenth Century Review. 

"As a poet he achieves to his verse that half lyrical beauty which marks the Elizabethans." Literature (London). 

" He has attempted the bravest and most difficult vehicle in literary art, the supreme accomplishment for poets of 
any time, and he has succeeded." The Outlook (London). . 

11 Passion is aglow on every page, and throughout we catch that special note which no man has ever named or defined, 
but which even the humblest person who has been made free of the Brotherhood of Letters cannot fail to realize as the 
essential mark of true poetry." The Spectator.

MISS MARY JOHNSTON'S GREAT NOVEL 

To HAVE AND To HOLD 

With Eight Illustrations by HOWARD PYLE, E. B. THOMPSON, 

A. W. BETTS, and EMLEN MCDONNELL. 

Crown 8vo, $1.50 

Hardly any other serial story ever published in America has excited so keen and 
widespread interest as this story has excited while appearing in The Atlantic Monthly. 
The dramatic plot ; the interest of the time and place and incidents in which the 
story moves ; the historic figures, who give to it life and the impress of truth ; the 
swift-moving scenes and the tremendous passions of the actors all these make this 
novel of early Colonial Virginia one of extraordinary power. Miss Johnston's mas- 
tery of the events and spirit of the time is astonishingly strong and firm ; and her 
style has a force and grace which lend peculiar attraction to the marvellous tale. 

Miss Johnston's Previous Novel 

PRISONERS OF HOPE 

Has in a high degree the qualities of " To Have and to Hold," and has enjoyed a remarkable 
popularity, which still continues. Crown 8vo, $1.50.

SAVROLA. 

A TALE OF THE REVOLUTION IN LAURANIA. 

By WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL, 
Author of "The River War: An Account of the Re- 
Conquest of the Soudan," and " The Story of the 
Malakand Field Force, 1897." Crown 8vo, $1.25. 
This story, as its sub-title indicates, deals chiefly with 
the incidents of the rebellion of the citizens of an imag- 
inary republic against a tyrannical dictator, though the 
narrative of the events leading up to the outbreak, and 
of the fighting in the city streets, is relieved by the love 
interest created by the relations of Savrola and Lucile. 
The New York Times, in a review published on the com- 
pletion of the serial issue of the story, called it " A 
dashing tale, told with much force and vigor." 

THE RIVER WAR: 

An Account of the Recovery of the Soudan. 

By WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL. Edited by Col. 
F. Rhodes, D.S.O. With 35 maps and 60 illus-

Mrs. Walford's New Novel: 

SIR PATRICK : THE PUDDOCK. 

By Mrs. L. B. WALFORD, author of The Baby's Grand- 
mother," " Leddy Marget," etc. Crown 8vo, buck- 
ram, $1.50. 

" Mrs. Walford's name first became familiar to read- 
ers with the publication of 'Mr. Smith: A Part of His 
Life.' It was an admirable book one of the cleverest 
of the minor novels of her generation. ... It has had 
many successors, not all of which were of equal rank, 
though ' The Baby's Grandmother ' is a fascinating bit 
of work. All were natural, fresh, and more or less 
piquant, all were interesting, for that is one quality at 
least which this writer never lacks. She has the art to 
make live before us a man's deep love, a girl's shy and 
passionate response, and if her types are on the whole 
few, she knows them thoroughly and makes us know 
them, too. 

Now, after many years, she returns to something 
like the theme of her first success . . . the prettiest of 
love stories, and strewn along its course are some little 
studies of modern English character and society that are 
full of truth and humor." New York Tribune. 



THE REDEMPTION OF EGYPT. 

By W. BASIL WORSFOLD, author of " The Principles 
of Criticism," " South Africa," etc. With 4 illustra- 
tions in color, 20 full-page and 70 text illustrations 
from sketches and photographs by the author. Fcp. 
4to, about 300 pages, $7.50. 

The subjects which are most fully treated in the 
descriptive chapters are the remains of Mediaeval Cairo, 
the Mosques of Cairo, as illustrative of Saracenic Art; 
the Pyramids, and the Temples in the neighborhood of 
Luxor and at Philae. These subjects are fully illus- 
trated by half-tone blocks of the writer's sketches. 

The History of Lord Lytton's Indian 
Administration, 1876=1880. 

Compiled from Letters and Official Papers. By Lady 
BETTY BALFOUR. With portrait and map. Medium

value to the future historian is unquestionable." Standard.

PUTNAM'S NEW BOOKS 



Bismarck 

And the Foundation of the German Empire. 
By J. W. HEADLAM, M.A., Fellow of King's 
College. Heroes of the Nations, No. 25. Fully 
illustrated. 12mo, $1.50. 

"The work of this author is conspicuously superior to 
that of other recent writers on the subject. His conclusions 
are thoroughly sound and the book is a vast improvement 
on all the volumes thus far printed in England." 

The Athenaeum. 

Henry Knox 

(1750-1806.) A Soldier of the Revolution. 
Major-General in the Continental Army, Wash- 
ington's Chief of Artillery, etc. By NOAH 
BROOKS. American Men of Energy, No. 2. Fully 
illustrated. 12mo, $1.50. 

The author, in his well-known forceful manner, shows 
that General Knox was a more important figure among the 
Revolutionary officers than many others who have been 
more conspicuous in histories. 

Theodore Beza 

(1519-1605.) The Counsellor of the French 
Reformation. By HENRY MART YN BAIRD, of 
New York University. Heroes of the Reformation 
Series, No. 4. Fully illustrated. 12mo, $1.50. 
It is rather remarkable that this book should be the first 
biography of Beza in the English language, because Beza 
played a very prominent part in the Reformation movement ; 
but the fact is he has been overshadowed by Calvin, just as 
Melancthon was overshadowed by Luther. It was, how- 
ever, richly worth while to present in detail the life of such 
a worthy man and fine scholar. 

Exploratio Evangelica 

A Brief Examination of the Basis and Origin of 
Christian Belief. By PERCY GARDNER, author 
of " New Chapters in Greek History," etc. 8vo, 
net $4.50. 

"A book characterized by learning, sobriety, and re- 
strained intensity/' The Speaker. 

Travels in Spain 

Edited by ARCHER M. HUNTINGTON. With illus- 
trations in photogravure. 16mo, net $1.50. 

The ingenious and diverting letters of the Lady' 's 

travels in Spain, describing the devotions, nunneries, humors, 
customs, laws, militia, trade, diet, and recreations of the 
people. 

The Regeneration of the United 
States 

A Forecast of its Industrial Evolution. By 
WILLIAM MORTON GRINNELL. 12mo, $1.00. 
The opening chapters of Mr. Grinnell's volume are de- 
voted to a consideration of the early history of the United 
States, with its lofty political ideals reduced in practice, as 
contrasted with the political and business degeneration which 
characterized the last half of the nineteenth century. 



The Stage as a Career 

A Sketch of the Actor's Life, Its Requirements, 
Hardships, and Rewards. By P. G. HUBERT, Jr. 
12mo, $1.00. 

Mr. Hubert's experience as a dramatic critic has brought 
him into close relations with the stage, and he speaks upon 
the subject with personal knowledge. His volume gives a 
sketch of the actor's life, its requirements, hardships, and 
rewards. He describes the qualifications and training essen- 
tial to success, and gives expert opinions from such famous 
actors as Sir Henry Irving, Lawrence Barrett, Dion Bouci- 
cault, Joseph Jefferson, Helen Modjeska, Mary Anderson, 
and Maggie Mitchell. 

Earthwork Out of Tuscany 

Being Impressions and Translations of MAURICE 
HEWLETT. New edition, with additional illus- 
trations in photogravure. 12mo, net $2.50. 
" The book is an original and valuable production, bring- 
ing to the interpretation of a familiar theme new insight, new 
feeling, new art. It is delicate, spiritualized work, not the 
sort that most easily finds favor to-day." N. Y. Tribune. 

The Midsummer of Italian Art 

Containing an Examination of the Works of 
Michel Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael Santi, 
and Correggio. By FRANK PRESTON STEARNS, 
author of " Tintoretto." Second edition, revised. 
Illustrated. 8vo, $2.25. 

" One of the most genuinely delightful and readable art 
books. The work is a model of sensible art writing." 

New York Times. 

Voices of Freedom 

And Studies in the Philosophy of Individuality. 

By HORATIO W. DRESSER, author of " The 

Power of Silence," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

This is the author's strongest, most philosophical book. 

It is broader, more fundamental than the previous volumes. 

It replies to criticisms, and contains advanced views and 

doctrines which are in some sense a departure from the 

teaching of the earlier volume. It considers also the social 

problem, and aims to harmonize the truth contained in 

present day theories of Individualism and Socialism. 

St. Paul's Epistle 

An Historical Commentary on St. Paul's Epistle 
to the Galatians. By W. M. RAMSAY, D.C.L., 
Professor in Aberdeen University, author of 
" Church in the Roman Empire," etc. 8vo, 
net $3.00. 

The author shows in this book how much light the 
Epistle to the Galatians throws on contemporary history in 
the widest sense the history of religion, society, thought, 
manners, education in the Eastern Provinces of the Empire. 

Heredity and Human Progress 

By W. DUNCAN McKiM, A.M., Ph.D. 12mo, 
net $1.50. 

An expedient for relieving society of the heavy burden 
imposed upon it by weaklings and criminals.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS 



The greatest and most scholarly work on the History of the Ancient World. 

The Passing of the Empires (Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, 
and Medea), sso B.C. to 330 B.C. 

By Prof. G. MASPERO, author of " The Dawn of Civilization " and " The Struggle of the Nations." 
Edited by the Rev. Prof. A. H. SAYCE. Translated by M. L. McCLURE. With Maps and numerous 
Illustrations, including Three Colored Plates. Uniform edition. Quarto. Cloth, $7.50. 

This monumental work brings the history of Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, and Medea down to the victories of 
Alexander the Great, and completes Professor Maspero's great series on the history of the ancient world. Like the pre- 
ceding: volumes, it represents the latest results of the highest scholarship, and it is magnificently illustrated. Professor 
Maspero's three volumes constitute a work which is, and must remain for some time to come, the most comprehensive and 
trustworthy account of the ancient Eastern world. 

History of the People of the United States. 

By Prof. JOHN BACH McMASTER. Vol. V. 8vo. Cloth, with Maps and Index, $2.50. (Nearly Ready.) 

The period in our history from 1822 to 1830 which is described in Professor McMaster's new volume has never been 
fully presented before as regards many of its civic, social, financial, literary, and educational phases. Furthermore, the 
close of Monroe's second term, the administration of John Quincy Adams, and the opening years of Jackson furnished 
subjects of the utmost importance, including the formulation of the Monroe Doctrine, the social, political, and industrial 
changes which paved the way for the triumph of democracy, and the various banking and financial experiments of the 
time. Many of the topics treated are of peculiarly timely interest. 

The International Geography. 

By Seventy Authors, including Right Hon. James Bryce, Sir W. M. Conway, Prof. W. M. Davis, 
Prof. Angelo Heilprin, Prof. Fridtjof Nansen, Dr. J. Scott Keltic, and F. C. Selous. With 488 Illus- 
trations. Edited by HUGH ROBERT MILL, D.Sc. 8vo. Cloth, 1088 pages. 

This is a convenient volume for the intelligent general reader, and the library which presents expert summaries of the 
results of geographical science throughout the world at the present time. The book contains nearly five hundred illustra- 
tions and maps which have been specially prepared. It is designed to present in the compact limits of a single volume an 
authoritative conspectus of the science of geography and the conditions of the countries at the end of the nineteenth century. 

The Comparative Physiology and Morphology of Animals. 

By Prof. JOSEPH LE CONTE. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00. 

The work of Darwin on the derivation of species and the descent of man awakened a new interest in the lower animals, 
and furnished additional evidence of their close kinship with ourselves. A fresh field of study was thus opened up, 
embracing the likenesses and differences of action as well as structure found throughout the animal kingdom. In this 
work Professor Le Conte gives us, in his well-known clear and simple style and with the aid of numerous illustrations, an 
interesting outline of these similarities and variations of function as displayed among the various classes of animals from 
the lowest to the highest, man included. 

A History of American Privateers The White Terror.

JOHN RUSKIN. 

Within a few days of the completion of his 
eighty-first year, death has crowned the labors 
of John Raskin, and he has entered the com- 
pany of the immortals. There is no English- 
man of his intellectual and moral stature left 
alive ; his peers have all gone before him, and 
now the last of the great spirits who have 
shaped for our Victorian age its ethical and 
sesthetical ideals has been gathered to his rest. 

" As he willed, he worked : 
And, as he worked, he wanted not, be sure. 
Triumph his whole life through, submitting work 
To work's right judges, never to the wrong, 
To competency, not ineptitude." 

His life was so complete, so filled with mani- 
fold serviceable activities, so rich in the garner 
of life's best fruits, that we cannot deplore his 
death, however sincere our mourning, but must 
rather be touched with a deep solemnity at the 
thought of what he did and what he was, min- 
gled with a deep gratitude for the example of 
his consecrated days. His work for mankind 
was ended a full decade ago, and the peaceful 
hours that were given him after his pen had 
been laid aside removed him so entirely from 
any sort of contact with the active world that 
his continued bodily presence among men has 
been difficult to realize. 

" The soul that's tutelary now 
Till time end, o'er the world to teach and bless " 

has seemed to us hardly more than a disem- 
bodied spirit since the year when those " Prae- 
terita " which we were reading with such eager 
interest met with their final interruption, and 
became themselves things of that past with 
which they were concerned. 

John Raskin was born at Herne Hill, a Lon- 
don suburb, on the eighth of February, 1819. 
He died January 20, 1900, at his Lake Coun- 
try home, Brantwood, in Coniston, where some- 
thing like the last score of his years were spent. 
His intellectual activity covers a period of 
nearly sixty years, for his precocity was marked, 
and he wrote creditable verses at the age of 
ten or thereabouts. At fifteen we find him 
contributing to a periodical of popular science 
papers with such titles as " Enquiries on the 
Causes of the Color of the Water of the Rhine " 
and " Facts and Considerations on the Strata

[Feb. 1, 



of Mont Blanc." From this time until his 
physical breakdown at the age of seventy, there 
is no year that does not add its title or titles 
to the bibliography of his writings, the mere 
list of which, without comment, would nearly, 
if not quite, fill up all the space here at our 
command. And what memories these titles 
evoke in the minds of men and women to whom 
the message of Ruskin has come as a veritable 
new gospel of beauty and the conduct of life ! 
They think of "Modern Painters," "The 
Stones of Venice," " The Seven Lamps of 
Architecture," and recall the quickened vision, 
the new appreciation, the deepened insight, 
which the reading of these books has brought 
them when viewing the cities and the galleries 
of Europe. They think of "Sesame and 
Lilies " and " The Queen of the Air," and re- 
call the stimulus and the fresh inspiration that 
these books have brought to the study of liter- 
ature. They think of " The Crown of Wild 
Olive " and " The Ethics of the Dust," and 
recall their realization of the unity of truth 
and goodness and beauty, their first sense of 
the fashion in which the cultivated intelligence 
apprehends the most diverse of phenomena as 
related to the same central set of ideals, in 
thought welding beauty to utility, and art to 
the practical conduct of life. They think of 
Munera Pulveris " and " Unto This Last," 
and recall the heightened sense of social solid- 
arity which they derived from these books, the 
view of human intercourse as a complex of mu- 
tual obligations, the doctrine of duties applied 
as a corrective to the doctrine of rights. Finally, 
they think of " Fors Clavigera " and " Prae- 
terita," and recall the unselfish character and 
single-hearted devotion to the service of human- 
ity which these books so unconsciously portray, 
while love and reverence for the writer become 
blended into one emotion of thankfulness for all 
of his gifts to mankind, the most precious of 
them all being the gift of himself. 

Mr. Buskin's career has two well-defined 
periods. During the first, he was essentially 
a teacher of art ; during the second, he was 
essentially a teacher of ethics. The year 1860 
marks the grand climacteric of his life, for it saw 
the completion of " Modern Painters " and the 
inauguration, with " Unto this Last," of the long 
series of the writings which are concerned with 
men in their social relations. When the turn- 
ing-point was reached, he was about forty years 
of age, he had become the foremost writer of 
his time upon the subject of the fine arts, he 
had forced an unwilling public to recognize the 



genius of the great landscape painter of En- 
gland, he had become the interpreter of Giotto, 
and Tintoretto, and many other great artists 
hitherto imperfectly appreciated or not at all, 
he had espoused the cause of the Pre-Raphael- 
ites, given effective aid to their propaganda, 
and had befriended them individually when 
help was most grateful, he had made himself 
one of the greatest masters of English prose, 
thereby increasing tenfold his influence as a 
critic of art, he had, finally, been called upon to 
bear his portion of the private grief which is the 
common lot of men, and the brief chapter of 
his domestic happiness had come to an end. 
His work done in the field of art criticism has 
called forth an enormous amount of discussion, 
in the form of both approval and dissent. At; 
first, his opinions excited violent antagonism ; 
then, for a period, the force of his eloquence 
seemed to carry everything before it ; then, 
again, a marked reaction set in, and a deliber- 
ate effort was made to belittle his achievements 
and minimise his influence. We do not think 
that the two parties to this controversy have 
ever joined issue fairly and squarely. We may 
allow the justice of much that has been said 
by his hostile critics by Mr. Stillman, for 
example, and Dr. Waldstein yet admit almost 
to the full what has been claimed for him by 
the most earnest of his champions. Both par- 
ties are right, in some sense. For the attack, 
we may say that his specific judgments were 
often wrong, that his bestowal of praise was 
exaggerated beyond all reason, that his ad- 
vice to painters was frequently impracticable, 
and that his influence upon contemporary ar- 
tists was slight. But for the defence we must 
also say something. We must say, for example, 
that he made the general English public think 
more seriously about art than it had ever done 
before. We must say that his writings opened 
eyes by the thousands that had hitherto been 
blind, and, if those eyes did not see just what 
he would have had them see, they were at least 
opened to some kind of truth that would not 
have been revealed to them at all except for 
his influence. We must say, also, that he gave 
to the pursuit and study of art a dignity that 
it had never known before, by virtue of his 
constant insistence upon the relation of art to 
morality, his unalterable determination to judge 
of artistic work from other standpoints than the 
narrow one of technique, and the prophetic 
fervor with which he proclaimed the gospel, 
not of art for art's sake, but of art for the sake 
of man's temporal delight and eternal salvation.

The change that came over the complexion 
of Mr. Raskin's thought in his early forties was 
very marked. He had outgrown the narrow- 
ness of his early beliefs, his sympathies had 
broadened, he had learned that life was more 
than art, he had resolved to do what he might 
to bring practical counsel and effective help to 
his fellow-men. At first, and for ten years or 
thereabouts, he confined himself for the most 
part to his writings, which now acquire for 
themselves a range that they had not known 
before ; then, with the fortune which had come 
to him upon the death of his father, and which 
he felt that he was to hold in trust only, he set 
about doing things, he began the publication 
of the " Fors Clavigera," and instituted the 
Guild of St. George. In the first letter of 
" Fors," he thus stated his programme in gen- 
eral terms : 

" I am not an unselfish person, nor an Evangelical 
one ; I have no particular pleasure in doing good ; neither 
do I dislike doing it so much as to expect to be rewarded 
for it in another world. But I simply cannot paint, nor 
read, nor look at minerals, nor do anything else that I 
like, and the very light of the morning sky, when there 
is any which is seldom, now-a-days, near London 
has become hateful to me, because of the misery that I 
know of, and see signs of, where I know it not, which 
no imagination can interpret too bitterly. Therefore, 
as I have said, I will endure it no longer quietly; but 
henceforward, with any few or many who will help, do 
my poor best to abate this misery." 

That so radical a programme as Mr. liuskin 
marked out for his declining years was fore- 
doomed to failure, as far as practical outcome 
was concerned, must have appeared manifest 
to any temperate observer. He sought to re- 
construct English society, to counteract the 
combined forces of democratic impulse and 
economic law, to restore to the nineteenth cen- 
tury the ideals of the thirteenth. A few only 
of the items in this programme may be speci- 
fied. Railways were to be done away with, 
and labor-saving machinery abandoned. The 
taking of interest was to be held sinful, and the 
regime of status was to replace the regime of 
contract. Individual impulse was to be sup- 
pressed by the weight of a restored social hier- 
archy. The whole system of popular education 
was to be made over upon essentially mediaeval 
lines. These things, and many more like unto 
them, were urged with all the ingenuity of ar- 
gument and eloquence of appeal at the author's 
command, and, as far as might be, he put these 
things into practical effect in his own life, and 
in the lives of those over whom he had any sort 
of control. 

No summary in the bare outline form just 



attempted is really fair to Mr. Ruskin. The 
stupendous wrongheadedness of such a pro- 
gramme, so stated, merely repels, and we would 
not repel a single possible reader from even 
the most practically impossible of the books 
wherein the parts of this programme are set 
forth. The attitude of the sane intelligence 
toward these teachings is expressed by Mr. 
Frederic Harrison when he says : " In one sense, 
no doubt, I stand at an opposite pole of ideas, 
and in literal and direct words, I could hardly 
adopt any one of the leading doctrines of his 
creed. As to mine, he probably rejects every- 
thing I hold sacred and true with violent 
indignation and scorn." Yet in spite of this 
divergence of positive belief, Mr. Harrison has 
made the author the subject of one of the most 
glowing panegyrics ever penned, and he ex- 
presses what we believe will remain the delib- 
erate judgment of mankind when he goes on to 
speak in the following strain : 

" Some day, perhaps, a future generation will be able 
to take up these outpourings of the spirit, not to criticise 
and condemn what they find there to dispute or to laugh 
at, but in the way in which sensible men read Plato's 
1 Republic,' or the book of Ezekiel, or Dante's ' Vita 
Nuova,' to enjoy the melody of the language, the inspir- 
ing poetry, and their apocalyptic visions, without being 
disturbed in the least by all that is mystical, fantastical, 
impossible in the ideal of humanity they present." 

In a word, the balance of Mr. Ruskin's teach- 
ings, whatever specific vagaries they may em- 
body, will rest upon the side of progress, of 
ethical inspiration, of worthy human activity, 
of all that is desirable for the uplifting of the 
race. In this belief, we would earnestly recom- 
mend the most extreme of his books, even 
" Unto this Last," and the many volumes of the 
" Fors Clavigera," not indeed as the best food 
for untrained minds, but as a helpful influ- 
ence to the cultivated intelligence, as a needed 
corrective for all that is unspiritual and mate- 
rialistic in the thought of the age. Their 
essential teaching is at one with that of the 
great leaders of man's ethical and religious 
thought, and their perversity of utterance no 
more than an accident powerless to work last- 
ing injury. The gift of communion with such 
a spirit is one of the most precious that litera- 
ture can offer, and a deep sense of gratitude, 
of reverent affection, is what remains to us 
unshaken, after all possible exceptions have 
been taken, after all needful allowances have 
been made, when we think of the great work 
and the noble life that have ended in the clos- 
ing year of the century to which they have 
lent so imperishable a lustre.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

ON FRENCH AND ENGLISH POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The controversy which has been raging regarding the 
relative merits of French and English poetry, and which 
has lately been touched upon editorially in THE DIAL, 
is replete with much interest to one whose love embraces 
more than the poetry of his native tongue. It is need- 
less to say that most of the unfriendly criticisms offered 
in such comparison are not sufficiently cosmopolitan in 
spirit, and give little more than an individual stand- 
point. We here touch upon what has not been suffi- 
ciently emphasized, and what seems to me to be the 
essential test of the worth of any comparative study in 
French and English verse. How far does racial antago- 
nism or race-difference, which is the soul of idiom or 
language-difference, act as a barrier even to the best- 
trained minds in a just appreciation of the inmost spirit 
of any foreign tongue ? And how far is it only indi- 
vidual taste, such as might lead one in one's own lan- 
guage to prefer one poet to another ? What factors are 
to be reckoned with more carefully than these ? 

Long before Tennyson's or Arnold's expressed indif- 
ference to the Alexandrine verse, voices were loud in 
England against French poetry. Keats, not without 
bitterness, condemned the entire classical literature, 
some of France's greatest names. They were 

"closely wed 

To musty laws lined out with wretched rule 
And compass vile ; . . . they went about, 
Holding a poor decrepit standard out 
Marked with most flimsy mottoes, and in large 
The name of one Boileau ! " 

Before Keats, Dryden (otherwise a great admirer and 
follower of the French classics) severely criticized, in 
his preface to " All for Love," Racine's character- 
drawing, especially the feebleness of his heroes. 

England's criticism, however, never took the shape of 
a polemic. That was reserved for Germany. I need 
hardly refer to Lessing's hostile attitude, or the icono- 
clastic spirit taken up by August Wilhelm Schlegel, 
who decided that it was about time that the entire 
classical dramatists, including Moliere, were shelved. 
Schiller was indifferent, and Goethe warmly enthusiastic 
only for Moliere, though he prized the tragedy of 
Racine and Voltaire. When Jacob Grimm wrote to 
Michelet that he could find no " poetic satisfaction " in 
either Corneille, Racine, or Boileau, Sainte-Beuve sighed: 
" Encore une fois il y a malentendu, et du cote" de 
1'Allemagne je crains que ce ne soit presque sans remede, 
nous avons beau faire et beau dire, la-bas nous ne som- 
mes pas pris au se*rieux poe'tiquement; le ge*uie des races 
s'y oppose." And we ask, shall we ever clear these 
barriers of racial misunderstanding ? Will the master- 
ing of the technicalities of a foreign language bring us 
nearer to an unbiased judgment of its spirit ? The most 
hopeful reply is not assuring. Karl Hillebrand, who 
spoke French as fluently as his native tongue, and who 
loved the genius of France, asks whether it is likely 
that she will ever produce the equal of Shakespeare, 
Goethe, or Dante. 

If we proceed to consider the relative values of sep- 
arate words, adverse criticism, it seems to me, becomes 
absurd. A French lady once asked me the English for 
" belle fille," and on my replying " beautiful girl," she 
was horrified, and distorting the pronunciation, ex- 
claimed, " mais que c'est laid ! " Can there be any 



common standpoint from which to judge the relative 
values of any single words in two different languages ? 
The concepts being the same, the word or medium will 
satisfy the race which has used it from time immemorial. 
One may speak of words as apparently different in 
quality, but will not the French " for a' that " prefer 
their disparaged " fille," " amour," " ciel," to the " girl," 
" love," " sky," of the " harsher " language across the 
channel ? If the Englishman finds " fille," " amour," 
" ciel," flat or paltry, is it too much to say that his 
judgment is warped not only by an obtuseness for the 
" finesses " of a foreign living language, but also by un- 
justly associating with the French tongue the empty 
shell of that which was not her parent-speech, i. e., the 
classical Latin, long dead ? If one of the English writers 
in this controversy speaks sneeringly of the Latin char- 
acter of French, it is clear that his Virgil and his Cicero, 
or the dead " filia," " atnor," " caelum," were barriers 
that kept him from appreciating the living " fille," 
"amour," and "ciel." 

The difficulty remains if we proceed from words to 
phrases. We hear Mounet Sully in Hamlet (I should 
say Sarah Bernhardt to be up to date): " Etre ou n'etre 
pas, c'est la la question" (trans, by Dumas). What 
Anglo-Saxon lover of Shakespeare can help smiling ? 
though he will not, if he be in Paris, offend his polished 
host, by laughing in his face. Who would recognize 
the original of many (or any) passage in that wholly 
inadequate translation ? Many of the most poetical 
passages, as, for example, the sublime " absent thee 
from felicity awhile," are altogether omitted. Be- 
cause, adds the exultant English critic, the French lan- 
guage is incapable of such poetic expression ! 

Let us examine the other side of the question. Vol- 
taire is horrified at the " not a mouse stirring " of the 
soldier on the watch, and after translating the " undig- 
nified " phrase to make its grotesqueness apparent, with 
" je n'ai pas entendu une souris trotter," he adds: "Voi- 
1k qui est naturel, dans un corps de garde, mais uon 
pas dans une trage"die." Jules Lemaitre, in comparing 
a recent French translation of Macbeth with the orig- 
inal, triumphantly holds it up as superior to the English 
version. Can this be the judgment of one of the forty 
immortals of the Academy ? Is there, then, any com- 
mon ground of criticism? No: le genie des races s'y 
oppose. 

A factor of an importance almost equal to racial an- 
tagonism is that of individual temperament and taste. 
We might distinguish two classes of critics: first, the 
poet endowed with creative power, to whom we grant 
strong antagonistic feelings against all that does not 
harmonize with the dictates of his genius. But (sec- 
ondly) those who are merely critics (etre critique ou, mon 
Dieu, pen de chose), who only adjudge the crowns ac- 
cording to the light they have, must judge in all mat- 
ters of comparison, as between French and English 
poetry, from a basis of mutual toleration. Where inher- 
ited or racially opposed conceptions of poetry dominate, 
the critic's vision cannot be clear. 

To illustrate the point I wish to make, and partly 
also for the mere delight of setting them down here, 
I place side by side three poems of similar beauty in 
conception, of equal poetic delicacy, simplicity, and 
charm. 

Victor Hugo: 

"Soyez comme 1'oiseau pose" pour un instant 
Sur des rameaux trop f reles ; 

Qui sent trembler la branche, mais qui chante pourtant, 
Sachant qu'il a des ailes."

Goethe: 

" Ich singe wie der Vogel singt, 
Der in den Zweigen wohnet, 
Das Lied das aus der Kehle dringt, 
1st Lohn der reichlich lohnet." 
And Browning: 

" Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge 
Leans to the field and scatters on the clover 
Blossoms and dew-drops at the bent spray's edge 
That 's the wise thrush : he sings each song twice over 
Lest you should think he never could recapture 
The first fine careless rapture ! " 

As I read each of these separately, I prefer it to the 
others, and in the end can make no choice. Comparison 
seems inadequate, for the pleasure each gives is perfect. 
No individual verdict on their relative merits could be 
final; while, if the racial feeling were to decide, French, 
Germans, and English would each prefer their own. Let 
us, then, not take any judgment passed on foreign verse 
too seriously. In the realm of poetry there is room for 
much that the critic would often deprive us of, and which 
flourishes there none the less in undying beauty. 

The plea I make is one for mutual toleration. The 
critics on both sides of the channel have been most un- 
fair. They take color from the spirit they comprehend, 
which is only their own national spirit. The federation 
of the world is no more a dream than absolute justice 
in any judgment on a foreign literature. Apart from 
the great human truths, the general truths, the abiding 
truths, which are the same for all peoples, a nation's 
individual traits must be seen with that nation's eyes. 
It is easier to blame superficially, and in the spirit of 
prejudice, than to praise judiciously, generously. Let us 
at least be willing to recognize all that is beautiful and 
abiding in the world of thought and art, and make it our 
own as far as lies in our power: for there alone we shall 
find that spirit of sweetness and repose, which, as Sainte- 
Beuve has exquisitely said, " nous rdconcilie, nous en avous 
souvent besoin, avec les hommes et avec nous-memes."

UNIVERSITY "SPELLING REFORM." 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

At a time when the memory of the Prince of cacograph- 
ical chauvinists is becoming less and less fragrant among 
the better informed of his countrymen, the University of 
Chicago takes occasion to cast its spadeful of mud into the 
waters he has so disturbed. Equally without authority, 
discretion, or taste in the premises, this institution of 
learning lends its name to an exhibition of illiteracy at 
which Webster himself would have revolted. Little 
except this illiteracy of spelling now remains to us of 
Webster's various antics. Under the benign influences 
of his alma mater, we have seen disappear, successively, 
his etymologies, his orthoepies, and his definitions. Only 
the cacography remains, a pitiful memorial of a time 
when American hatred of British oppression could 
find expression in doing a harm to English speech. The 
unreasonable prejudices between the English-speaking 
nations are disappearing in the light of a better under- 
standing; more books are printed in America every 
year in the only orthography current among all branches 
of the English race; why, then, should this dying " pro- 
vincialism of nationality " find support at an institution 
supposedly devoted to the humaner letters ? Or, rather, 
why should such an institution commit itself to the exten- 
sion of a national bad habit which, like tobacco-chewing, 
the rest of us are steadily and surely overcoming ?

MR. GODKIN AND "THE EVENING POST." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A monthly magazine in New York, which has peri- 
odical attacks of uncontrollable brilliancy in its edi- 
torial department, has made Mr. Godkin and " The 
Evening Post " the subject of a number of statements 
which require a protest. After saying, truly enough, 
that the editor and the paper were thoroughly identified 
in policy and spirit, he tells us that in his editorial ca- 
pacity Mr. Godkin "not only felt that he himself could 
do no wrong, but that men of other views could do no 
right." Again, he thinks it strange that a man so 
highly cultivated " should never have been able to rec- 
ognize anything that was good in those who were op- 
posed to him, and that he could see nothing in their 
policy and motives except folly, or malice, or baseness, 
or incompetence." Now, I have been a daily reader of 
" The Evening Post " for some years, just because it is 
nol characterized by the qualities here ascribed to it 
under Mr. Godkin's editorship. From the copies lying 
on my shelves I will undertake to fill an entire number 
of the magazine from which I have quoted with edi- 
torials from " The Evening Post " in hearty commenda- 
tion of specific acts of men to the general policy of 
whom it is well known that Mr. Godkin has been stren- 
uously in opposition. And, on the other hand, although 
Mr. Godkin was in general an earnest supporter of 
President Cleveland, he showed himself at the same 
time a severe critic when occasion offered. 

We are told again that he " would never frankly and 
fairly and conspicuously admit an error." Now I have 
a pretty wide acquaintance with our more prominent 
daily papers, and I can name no other among them that 
allows its errors to be corrected in its columns with 
anything approaching the freedom of " The Evening 
Post." No man can read it, even hastily, for a month, 
without meeting instances of this; and that, too, though 
its freedom from sensationalism gives it a much greater 
freedom from errors of fact than is the case with the 
average daily. It is also true that no other prominent 
daily is so ready to allow its editorial opinions to be 
questioned in its own columns. Its special correspond- 
ents have full liberty to express opinions contrary to 
its own (witness notably its Manila letters), and it 
does not back up its opinions by the exclusion or garb- 
ling of news matter apparently in conflict with those 
opinions. 

Indirectly, Mr. Godkin is also charged with " pessim- 
ism." How inevitable that charge is against any Amer- 
ican who gets it into his head that the outlook for good 
government is at least bright enough to make it worth 
fighting for ! And Mr. Godkin was also " extremely 
irritating." Yes, there is no gainsaying that his edi- 
torials were very irritating to any reader to whom 
the particular exhibition of incompetence, stupidity, or 
corruption which he was just then flaying was not irri- 
tating. If the editor from whom we have quoted has 
carefully read the " Post " during the weeks since his 
editorial was written, he has probably concluded by this 
time that he was over- hasty in assuming that its sting 
for such readers has been extracted by the withdrawal 
of Mr. Godkin. And that that sting may never be ex- 
tracted as long as there is any hope of irritating read- 
ers into a consciousness that there are evils in society 
and government which can be and ought to be eradi- 
cated, should be the hope and prayer of us all.

PLAYHOUSE RECOLLECTIONS.* 

The reader interested in theatrical matters 
may remember some unpleasant things said of 
the stage a few years ago by Mr. George 
Moore, and the tea-pot tempest that thereupon 
raged in the press. Mr. Moore was of opinion 
that if acting is to be considered an art at all 
(which he doubted), it is certainly the very 
lowest of the arts and the one making the slen- 
derest demands on the intelligence of those 
practising it. For what, Mr. Moore asked, in 
effect, is the actor but the playwright's parrot 
"a vulgar parrot that speaks by rote and 
screams before the footlights " ? and what, sci- 
entifically regarded, is his alleged art but the 
developed form of a simian turn for mimicry 
derived from caudate arboreal ancestors ? But 
that which particularly angered Mr. Moore, 
and, indeed, provoked his attack, was the fact 
that the modern successors of the humble " poor 
players " of the frankly disrespectable strollers 
of Marlowe's and Jonson's time not only regard 
themselves and are regarded as, technically, 
ladies and gentlemen, but are actually come to 
be, in too many cases, the recognized social lions 
and drawing-room idols of the day. This social 
vagary Mr. Moore styled " Mummer- Worship"; 
and we are sorry to say that the impetus of his 
onset against it carried him into some waspish 
innuendoes as to the morals of the fairer divini- 
ties of the cult, that did him no credit. 

We have mentioned Mr. Moore and his 
Histrio-mastix as furnishing a convenient con- 
trast to the veteran dramatic writer, Mr. 
Clement Scott, and his two thick volumes of 
rapturous stage memories, now before us. From 
his youth up, Mr. Scott has been a " mummer- 
worshipper " of the most ardent type, and his 
present production fairly entitles him, we think, 
to be called the Gronow of the Victorian stage. 
But the title of the book is certainly misleading, 
since it leads us to expect, what we assuredly 
do not get, a continuous history of the modern 
drama. At times, it is true, Mr. Scott seems 
in a fair way of starting out conscientiously to 
fulfil the implied promise of his title ; but he 
scarcely ever gets beyond a paragraph or so 
of dramatic history proper when a good story 
of " Johnny " Toole, or Sothern, or Charles 
Matthews, or some other notable maker or sub-

ject of good stories, pops into his head, and 
away he starts, with the bit in his teeth, and 
never pulls up until the end of the chapter is 
reached and it is too late to go on with the text 
formally propounded at the outset. Mr. Scott's 
stories are entertaining, and he clearly relishes 
them so much himself that it is hard to grudge 
him the pleasure of telling them. But it must 
in candor be said that the reader who goes to 
him for light and leading on the drama proper, 
and not for the ana and gossip of the playhouse, 
will generally be disappointed. The fact is, as 
one of Mr. Scott's critics has already pointed 
out, it is not so much the drama, broadly con- 
sidered, as the playhouse, that attracts and 
interests him. He has little patience with the 
sort of people (with whom, we confess, we are 
much in sympathy) who profess to find a higher 
and completer satisfaction in reading a dra- 
matic masterpiece than in seeing it acted. Mr. 
Scott would probably think it pedantic and 
affected to say that the best actor who ever trod 
the boards must inevitably dwarf in his ren- 
dering the poet's conception, say, of King Lear ; 
and, indeed, he frankly admits : 

" I do not believe it is possible to be thoroughly 
impressed with Shakespeare until you have seen his 
plays acted. Long before I had witnessed the majority 
of those masterpieces on the stage, I had studied Shake- 
speare, I had read and re-read Shakespeare, I had 
attended Shakespearean readings, Shakespearean dis- 
courses, and Shakespearean lectures; but I never thor- 
oughly understood ' the bard,' as he is called, until I 
saw him acted in those always-to-be-remembered days 
with Phelps at Sadler's Wells." 

Mr. Scott, with a degree of accuracy, de- 
scribes his book as an attempt to blend the 
outlines of the history of the stage with per- 
sonal reminiscences. Into the narrative he has 
woven a partial account of his career as a dra- 
matic critic in which capacity we are, as we 
gather, to regard him as in some sort the 
founder of a new school of writing. Before 
Mr. Scott, the dramatic critic was, as it seems, 
a sober and deliberate person, who took him- 
self and his function pretty seriously, and was 
given to postponing his written opinions upon a 
new play or a new actor for several days. With 
Mr. Scott came the new era. ** I was," he says, 
" the first journalist who attempted to make the 
account of a new play not so much a solemn 
and serious criticism as a picturesque report." 
" Solemn and serious criticism " is not, we are 
convinced, Mr. Scott's forte ; and it was well 
he realized the fact at the outset. 

We think it fair to characterize Mr. Scott's 
entertaining but incoherent and, we suspect,

hasty production as a sort of catalogue rai- 
sonne of the more prominent players of the 
period covered, enlivened with reminiscences 
of the playhouses, and anecdotes, appreciations, 
and biographical sketches of the players, and 
rather liberally padded with extracts from the 
critics the author's own journalistic " pic- 
turesque reports " being by no means neglected. 
Among Mr. Scott's reminiscences is an amus- 
ing one of the elder Dumas, upon whom he once 
called at Paris, armed with a letter of introduc- 
tion from Fechter. 

" Alexandre Dumas lived with his daughter, a very 
devout Catholic, in a fashionable quarter of Paris. The 
daughter was evidently away, and when I left my card 
and Fechter's letter I was ushered into a solemn room, 
which looked like an oratory, being full of crucifixes, 
relics, and sacred pictures. After waiting for some 
time in astonishment, for the religious atmosphere did 
not seem to coincide with my idea of the rollicking his- 
torian, novelist, and prolific dramatist, the servant re- 
turned to say that M. Dumas would see me. From the 
oratory I was ushered into a kind of kitchen. The scene 
had changed entirely. Behold the hero of hundreds of 
dramatic successes, in his shirt sleeves, his negro skin 
beaded with perspiration, his hair like an iron-gray 
scrubbing brush reversed, sitting before the fire, with a 
pretty girl on each knee, pretending to cook an omelette 
or preside over a vol-au-vent ! Dumas, as everyone 
knows, was an amateur cook, and he loved nothing bet- 
ter than to design, arrange, and carry out a dinner of 
his own invention. The girls pinched him, kissed him, 
chaffed him, and called him Papa.' He returned the 
compliment. He asked me about Fechter and his suc- 
cess, which interested him. He gave me some tickets 
for the theatre, and I left the cheery old man, still in 
his shirt sleeves before the stove, kissing the pretty 
girls on either knee." 

While Mr. Scott's Thespian ambition has been 
satisfied with the role of dramatic critic, he is, it 
seems, not altogether a stranger to the boards. 

" At the Bijou Theatre, Bayswater, I have enacted 
Christopher Larkings in Woodcock's Little Game,' and 
the boy Archie in < The Scrap of Paper.' I think I 
rather fancied myself in a black velvet coat and knick- 
erbockers, lent me by my old friend, Edmund Routledge, 
and a pair of scarlet stockings suggested by myself. 
This alarming costume secured me the honor of a scented 
note left at the stage door. My companions in crime 
still living are James M. Molloy, the gifted balladist 
and composer, and W. S. Gilbert, who rejoiced in the 
farce called 'Number One Round the Corner'; but I 
fancy this brilliant poet and dramatist was as bad an 
actor as I was. He could not have been a worse one." 

The volumes are handsomely gotten up, and 
contain many interesting portraits of players 
and playwrights, managers and critics. While 
of no great value as a contribution to the his- 
tory of the drama, they are lively and amusing, 
and should find favor with the members of the 
profession to which Mr. Scott has devoted the 
enthusiastic attention of a lifetime. E. G. J. 



THE REMINISCENCES OF MRS. HOWE.* 



It is a rich treasury of facts, anecdotes, and 
observations, relating to eminent persons and 
events of the last eighty years of our century, 
which Mrs. Julia Ward Howe has presented 
us in the volume modestly entitled " Reminis- 
cences." It is a gift to the future historian 
which he will not lightly value ; while for the 
reader who seeks entertainment chiefly, its 
pages abound with matter of interest, amuse- 
ment, and serious instruction. 

Mrs. Howe has enjoyed through life a com- 
manding opportunity for gaining insight into 
the character of the personages and the prin- 
ciples which have given distinction to the won- 
derful years included in the closing century. 
Most of the famous men and women of the 
time were known to her, and in many of the 
great movements that evolved in grand pro- 
gression, one following rapidly upon another, 
she was a living part. It is a memorable retro- 
spect, leaving with the mind, as the most last- 
ing impression, a sense of the dignity, the 
sincerity, the high-mindedness of the writer. 
Her judgments are marked by breadth and 
graciousness, and her own career from first to 
last was noble and generous. 

Mrs. Howe was born in 1819, in the city of 
New York, in a home of wealth and culture. 
Her father, a banker of high standing, was not 
only prominent in business affairs but in social 
circles, and his children were surrounded by 
every influence tending to nurture intelligence 
and develop the moral qualities. He was a 
Puritan of the Puritans, maintaining strict 
discipline in his household and a vigilant 
guardianship of the welfare of his daughters. 
No expense was spared in their education. They 
had the best masters in music, the languages, 
drawing, dancing, all the accomplishments be- 
fitting refined womanhood. But the social 
arena in which their gifts might find free dis- 
play was narrowly restricted. There was, nat- 
urally, some restiveness and discontent under 
such firm restraint, but the wisdom of it was 
justified in the light of mature experience. 

There was, however, no lack of genial life in 
the Ward mansion. At quiet dinners and in 
cheerful evenings in her own home and among 
her intimate friends, Miss Ward enjoyed un- 
usual opportunities for social cultivation. By 
the marriage of her brother Samuel with the

eldest granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, 
the friendly relations between the families 
deepened into intimacy. We are accustomed 
to think of the founder of the Astor house in 
America as a rude fur-trader whose life was 
spent in traffic with border Indians ; but Mrs. 
Howe represents him as a man of distinct lit- 
erary tastes, who loved to draw men of letters 
about him. At his hospitable board she fre- 
quently met Washington Irving, who, as she 
relates, " was silent in general company, and 
usually fell asleep at the dinner-table. . . . 
After a nap of some minutes he would open his 
eyes and take part in the conversation, appar- 
ently unconscious of having fallen asleep." 

The summer of 1841 was spent by Miss 
Ward with girl friends in the neighborhood of 
Boston. In company with Charles Sumner and 
the poet Longfellow, they paid a visit one day 
to Perkins Institute, where Laura Bridgman, 
the marvellous deaf, dumb, and blind girl, was 
receiving her education. Dr. Howe was ab- 
sent at the arrival of his guests, but before 
their leave " Mr. Sumner, looking out of a 
window, said, * Oh, here comes Howe on his 
black horse.' I looked out also," writes Mrs. 
Howe, " and beheld a noble rider on a noble 
horse." It was the prelude to her life romance. 
The doctor was her senior by nearly twenty 
years, but he had not long to sue for the gift of 
her hand. They were married in the spring of 
1843, and their wedding journey was prolonged 
a year amid the enticing scenes of Europe. 

In London, as in New York, Mrs. Howe was 
in contact with the distinguished men and 
women who lent their fame to the English cap- 
ital, for she was now the wife of one whom the 
world recognized as a hero and a philanthropist. 
With quick appreciation, Carlyle hastened to 
pay his respects with an invitation for a return 
visit from the estimable strangers. Mrs. Carlyle 
was too ill to receive them, and in her absence, 
writes Mrs. Howe, 

" I was requested to pour tea. Our Lost partook of 
it copiously, in all the strength of the teapot. As I 
filled and refilled his cup, I thought that his chronic 
dyspepsia was not to be wondered at. The repast was 
a simple one. It consisted of a plate of toast and two 
small dishes of stewed fruit, which he offered to us with 
the words, ' Perhaps ye can eat some of this. I never 
eat these things myself.' " 

Her visit to Wordsworth was a signal disap- 
pointment. The poet's widowed daughter had 
met with a heavy loss through some unfortunate 
American investment, and the calamity had com- 
pletely upset the family equilibrium. It was the 
sole topic touched upon during the interview. 



" The tea to which we had been bidden was simply a 
cup of tea, served without a table. We bore the har- 
assing conversation as long as we could. The only 
remark of Wordsworth's which I brought away was 
this : ' The misfortune of Ireland is that it was only a 
partially conquered country." 

On her return to Boston, Mrs. Howe found 
the transcendental movement exciting general 
observation. It was opposed to the traditions 
in which she was bred, but gradually its aims 
so won upon her she was able to accept it as 
" the new interpretation of life which the truth 
imperatively demanded." She who was reared 
in strict orthodoxy passed over to the church 
of Theodore Parker, much to the displeasure of 
her society friends. " What is Julia Howe 
trying to find at Parker's meeting ? " asked one 
of these in her presence. " Atheism," replied 
the lady addressed. " Not atheism," said Mrs. 
Howe in quick defense, " but theism." Else- 
where she remarks : 

" I can truly say that no rite of public worship, not 
even the splendid Easter service in St. Peter's at Rome, 
ever impressed me as deeply as did Theodore Parker's 
prayers. ... I cannot remember that the interest of 
his services varied for me. It was all one intense de- 
light. . . . His voice was like the archangel's trump, 
summoning the wicked to repentance and bidding the 
just take heart. It was hard to go out from his pres- 
ence, all aglow with enthusiasm which he felt and 
inspired, and hear him spoken of as a teacher of irre- 
ligion, a pest to the community." 

It was a struggle for Mrs. Howe to overcome 
her native prejudice against the reformers who 
were stirring society in Boston and New En- 
gland to moods of frenzy by their bold advo- 
cacy of the rights of the black man or the white 
woman to freedom and equality in the eye of 
the law. " She does n't like me, but I like her 
poetry," remarked Wendell Phillips, as he 
bought a copy of her first volume of poems. 
His amiable appreciation of her gifts as an au- 
thor softened her feeling and she was ready to 
engage with him in conversation and to listen 
to his oratory. He had afterwards no firmer 
friend than she, and she speaks of his ardent 
and tireless services in behalf of humanity in 
words of the warmest eulogy. Of Charles Sum- 
ner she has much to say, although it is plain 
her esteem for him was founded more upon his 
moral worth than upon special graces of intel- 
lect or charms of personal manner. In noting 
the differences between Phillips and Sumner, 
she observes : 

" The two men, although workers in a common cause, 
were very dissimilar in their natural endowments. 
Phillips had a temperament of fire, while that of Sum- 
ner was cold and sluggish. Phillips had a great gift 
of simplicity, and always made a bee line for the cen-

tral point of interest in the theme which he undertook 
to present. Sumner was recondite in language and 
elaborate in style. He was not much of a student, and 
abounded in quotations. In his sensational days, I once 
heard a satirical lady mention him as < the moral flum- 
mery member from Massachusetts, quoting Tibullus ! ' " 

Mr. Sumner had but little sense of humor, 
and quite lacked the faculty for quick response 
which puts one at ease in lively conversation. 
As he could not comprehend the wit which en- 
livens and sometimes idealizes the discourse in 
general society, so he failed signally to grapple 
with the intricacies of exact science. " I have 
heard him say," states Mrs. Howe, " that math- 
ematics remained a sealed book to him ; and 
that his professor at Harvard once exclaimed, 
4 Sumner, I can't whittle a mathematical idea 
small enough to get it into your brain." 

The value which Mr. Sumner placed upon 
his personal dignity is indicated by the follow- 
ing anecdote : 

" I once invited Mr. Sumner to meet a distinguished 
guest at my house. He replied, I do not know that I 
wish to meet your friend. I have outlived the interest 
in individuals.' In my diary of the day I recorded the 
somewhat ungracious utterance, with this comment: 
' God Almighty, by the latest accounts, has not got so 
far.'" 

Mrs. Howe's record during the Civil War 
begins with a visit from " old John Brown," 
who made upon her and her husband the im- 
pression of a powerful personality. Of the 
" noble war governor, John A. Andrew," she 
relates that when he learned of John Brown's 
hapless state in a Southern prison, without 
counsel or money, he " telegraphed to eminent 
lawyers in Washington to engage them for the 
defense of the prisoner, and made himself re- 
sponsible for the legal expenses of the case, 
amounting to thirteen hundred dollars." 

In the autumn of 1861, Mrs. Howe was in 
Washington, inspecting camps and hospitals in 
company with the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, 
Governor Andrew, and Dr. Howe. At the close 
of an interview with the President, Mr. Clarke 
said of him : 

"We have seen it in his face: hopeless honesty; that 
is all. . . . None of us knew then how deeply God's 
wisdom had touched and inspired that devout and pa- 
tient soul. At the moment, few people praised or trusted 
him. ' Why did he not do this, or that, or the other ? 
He a President, indeed! Look at this war, dragging on 
so slowly! Look at our many defeats and rare victories! ' 
Such was the talk that one constantly heard regarding 
him. The most charitable held that he meant well. 
Governor Andrew was one of the few whose faith in 
him never wavered." 

It was during this eventful visit that Mrs. 
Howe made her first attempt at public speaking, 



in an unstudied talk to a company of soldiers 
from Massachusetts, and also wrote, in a mo- 
ment of inspiration, the " Battle Hymn of the 
Republic." Her party had been singing the 
popular war songs of the day, concluding with 
"John Brown's body," when Mr. Clarke turned 
to her with the question, " Mrs. Howe, why do 
you not write some good words for that stirring 
tune ? " It had been in her mind to do so, but 
as yet the motive had not come to her. 

" I went to bed that night as usual, and slept, accord- 
ing to my wont, quite soundly. I awoke in the gray of 
the morning twilight; and as I lay waiting for the dawn, 
the long lines of the desired poem began to twine them- 
selves in my mind. Having thought out all the stanzas, 
I said to myself, I must get up and write these verses 
down, lest I fall asleep again and forget them.' So, 
with a sudden effort, I sprang out of bed, and found in 
the dimness an old stump of a pen which I remembered 
to have used the day before. I scrawled the verses 
almost without looking at the paper. I had learned to 
do this when, on previous occasions, attacks of versifi- 
cation had visited me in the night, and I feared to have 
recourse to a light lest I should wake the baby, who 
slept near me. I was always obliged to decipher my 
scrawl before another night should intervene, as it was 
only legible while the matter was fresh in my mind. At 
this time, having completed my writing, I returned to 
bed and fell asleep, saying to myself, I like this better 
than most things that I have written." 

The poem was published in the " Atlantic 
Monthly," without awakening special interest. 
But it reached the soldiers' camps, and they 
sang it in rousing chorus on the march and by 
their evening fires. It penetrated the walls of 
Libby Prison, and finally was rehearsed with 
startling effect by a released captive who told, 
in a public lecture in Washington, of the cheer 
it brought to the hearts of his comrades immured 
in that frightful death-pen in Virginia, and the 
success of the poem was assured. It was thence- 
forth the leading lyric of the war. " Mrs. 
Howe ought to die now," said one of her friends, 
" for she has done the best that she will ever." 
Mrs. Howe was of no such opinion herself, 
feeling still " full of good days' works," which 
she has to the present time been diligently per- 
forming. She was ever serious in her tastes 
and bent upon intellectual pursuits. " Mrs. 
Howe is not a great reader, but she always 
studies," was the remark of her husband, which 
well characterized the thorough nature of her 
mental attainments. As a member of the 
Radical Club, that " high congress of souls " 
which for years met monthly at the house of 
the Rev. John T. Sargent, as an associate of 
that noble band who strove long and painfully, 
but with final triumph, for the right of woman

THE VERNACULAR LITERATURE OF 
SCOTLAND.* 



At last we have a history of Scottish Ver- 
nacular Literature, and from so competent an 
authority as Mr. T. F. Henderson, associate edi- 
tor of the Centenary Burns. Probably no sub- 
ject in the whole range of literature has suffered 
more in the hands of the judicious than this. 
It is the fashion of the English literary his- 
torian to treat the Scottish literature as a mere 
adjunct of the English ; and being unable, for 
the most part, to appreciate or to understand 
the picturesque and racy vernacular, made up 
of an immense variety of subtle linguistic 
forces Cymric, Pictish, Gaelic, Norse, French, 
he is prone to judge the Scots writer by one 
of his styles only. Professor Courthope, pre- 
ferring the labored allegory of Gavin Douglas, 
finds few " notes of human interest " in Dunbar. 
So Mr. Edmund Gosse, with a natural affinity 
perhaps for "terms aureate," describes Dunbar's 
talent as " gorgeous," but denies that the poet 
ever gets away from the artificial in language. 

Just why no Scotchman has written a history 
of the vernacular until now, is not clear. Dr. 
Boss's " Early Scottish History and Litera- 
ture " is an essay in the field, but Dr. Ross 
brought his work down to the Reformation 
only, and, as his title shows, his point of view 
was not purely literary. Moreover, Dr. Ross's 
method was not scholarly, and his book was 
further unfortunate in being published after 
his death, without adequate editing. Professor 
Hugh Walker's " Three Centuries of Scottish 
Literature " is an admirable discussion of the

tory. By T. F. Henderson. London: David Nutt. (Im- 
ported by the New Amsterdam Book Co., New York.) 



later period. Meanwhile, a vast mass of mate- 
rial, collected by individual editors, such as 
Scott, Irving, and Laing, by the learned Clubs 
the Bannatyne, the Maitland, the Rox- 
burghe, and the Hunterian and by the Early 
English and Scottish Text Societies, has been 
accumulating. What was needed was a clear 
and intelligent treatment of the whole subject 
within reasonable limits. This is what Mr. 
Henderson has attempted, and on the whole 
successfully, although the thoroughness of his 
scholarship on certain points is open to doubt, 
and his style leaves something to be desired. 

The survey of the vernacular covers more 
than five centuries, from the " mokkyshe ryme" 
on Edward Longshanks to Allan Cunningham. 
It was no light task to condense so large a sub- 
ject into one volume, but Mr. Henderson has 
been equal to it. His judgment is discrimin- 
ating, his taste is correct, if not mellowed, and 
his sense of proportion is good. No important 
author has been overlooked, and one notes 
few omissions among writers not of the first 
consideration. " The Totall Discourse of the 
Rare Adventures " (of William Lithgow), 
1632, might have been included as a curious 
and interesting contribution to vernacular 
prose, and it is a genuine disappointment to 
miss "Aye Waukin', O!" which has been 
described as a perfect song, so fortunate also as 
to be the subject of a perfect criticism, that of 
Dr. John Brown in " Horae Subsecivae." 

Poetry bulks large in the Scottish vernacu- 
lar, and the picture of it here shown, represent- 
ing Dunbar receiving the torch from Chaucer 
and handing it on to Burns, is illuminating. 
The Scots " makaris " wrote, not a different 
language from Chaucer, but the same language, 
which, like him, they called " Inglisch." The 
difference is only that the genius of Chaucer 
made the Midland dialect, the London speech, 
English ; the " makaris " preserved the North- 
ern English, which did not become a dialect, 
in the modern sense, until after the union of 
the crowns in James VI. Like Chaucer, also, 
the " makaris " went to the French poets, and 
sometimes to the Italian, for models of versifi- 
cation. Of a lineage so ancient and so honor- 
able, by the time of Burns (as Mr. Henderson 
happily says) the poetic tradition of Scotland 
was the noblest ever inherited by any peasantry, 
far higher than could have derived from even 

O 

an ideal peasantry. Of what other great poet 
than Burns can it be said that much of the 
emotions and sentiments he expresses lay out- 
side his own personal experience ? Excepting

THE DIAL

the chapter on the ballads, which in the main 
follows Mr. Courthope, and possibly therefor 
suggests an ignoring of recent research, Mr. 
Henderson's treatment of Scottish poetry is 
excellent. His study of the relations between 
the French and Scottish poets, especially be- 
tween Villon and Dun bar, is so good that one 
wants more of it. We see Dunbar getting the 
idea of his stately " Lament for the Makaris " 
from Villon's ballads on the " dames " and 
" seigneurs " of olden time, and writing it in a 
favorite French form with him, the Icyrielle. 
Other Villon metres are the octave with refrain, 
Villon's double ballade, and the rondeau. 
Dunbar makes large use of the French octave, 
named by King James VI. the ballot royal, 
and more than a third of his verse is written 
in the stave of the French rondeau, with or 
without refrain. For two well-known French 
metres in English, the seven-line stanza of 
Chaucer's " Troilus and Criseyde," called by 
Gascoigne rime royal, and the rime couee, or 
tail rhyme, so largely used by Burns, Dunbar 
shows no great fondness. It is a pity that the 
chapter on Dunbar is not more compact ; as it 
is, it shows Mr. Henderson's exceptional knowl- 
edge of Scottish prosody at its best, and his 
logical, or rather illogical, arrangement of ma- 
terial at its worst. Dunbar surely stands in no 
need of an advocate, and fewer quotations would 
have sufficed to show his quality, his humor, 
always gay, sometimes saturnine, and now and 
then deliciously quaint and fantastic, as when 
in "Kynd Kittok," the alewife of Falkland 
Fells eludes St. Peter and gets into heaven 
privily, " God," we are told, " lukit and saw 
her lattin in, and lewch his hert sair"; the 
reality of his touch, his worldliness, and his 
stoicism, all expressed with a brilliancy of im- 
agination that time and circumstance have not 
dimmed, and a mastery of language that easily 
ranks him the greatest of the Chaucerians. 

But on the whole the quotations are made with 
so much reserve and judgment and taste as to 
whet the appetite. The " Bill of Fare " which 
Fergusson would have laid before Dr. Johnson 
when banqueted by the St. Andrews professors 
is fresh. His " Daft Days " is more familiar : 

" Now mirk December's dowie face 
Glowrs owre the rigs wi' sour grimace, 
While thro' his minimum of space, 

The bleer-ey'd sun, 
Wi' blinkin' light and stealing pace, 

His race doth run." 

There, to use the words of K. L. Stevenson, is 
" the model of great things to come " in 
Burns. Those who know (and who does not 



know?) Mrs. Craik's beautiful song, "Too 
Late," will find the refrain of it in a curious 
old allegorical poem, by Sir Richard Holland, 
called " The Buke of the Howlat ": 

"O Dowglas, O Dowglas, 
Tender and trewe ! " 

It is there given as a badge of the Douglases 
embroidered on the coat-armor of the pursui- 
vant. Exquisitely simple and sweet is the 
" Departe " of Alexander Scott, the farewell of 
the dying Master of Erskine, slain at Pinkie 
Cleugh, 1547, to the Queen Dowager, the 
beautiful Marie de Guise : 

" Adew my awin sweit thing, 
My joy and conforting, 
My mirth and sollesing 

Of erdly gloir ; 
Ffair weill, my lady brieht, 
And my remembrance rycht, 
Ffair weill, and haif gud nycht : 

I say no moir! " 

Brief quotations in prose are harder to make, 
but there is a good one from the diarist, James 
Melville, describing the young King James VI., 
in 1574, when eight years old, " walking up and 
down in the auld Lady Marr's hand, discours- 
ing of knowledge and ignorance." A single sen- 
tence from that belated humanist, George Bu- 
chanan, is an amusing hit, both at his old pupil, 
Queen Mary, and at the pride of the Hamiltons : 

"Thay wer in hoip yat scho sonld mary Johnne 
Hamiltoun ye Dukis sone quhome wt [with] inery lukis 
and gentill contenance (as scho could weill do) scho 
enterit in ye gayme of ye glaiks [coquetry], and causit 
ye rest of ye Hamiltonis to fon for faynnes [to play the 
fool for eagerness]." 

Scottish vernacular literature without Sir 
Walter Scott is the play of Hamlet with Hamlet 
left out. In his index, Mr. Henderson tells us 
that he mentions Sir Walter five times, and 
he honors him with one sentence by himself 
(p. 455). This sentence is well worth quoting, 
for two reasons : because it is all there is about 
Scott, and because it exhibits Mr. Henderson's 
style, as they say in homely phrase, with its 
foot around its neck. 

" Hogg as a poet was very much a rustic Sir Walter 
Scott, who was, besides, the founder of a vernacular 
school of his own, that of the vernacular novel a sub- 
ject too vast for our present consideration, but who 
very seldom in his poetry drops into the vernacular, 
and makes very chary use of it even in his lyrics, the 
only almost pure examples being the spirited Jock o' 
Hazeldean founded on an old ballad, the witty char- 
acter sketch of Donald Caird, and his new version of 
Carle, now the King 's Come ; but March, march, Ettrick 
and Teviotdale derived from the old General Leslie's 
March contains at least one vernacular exclamation; 
and the vernacular slightly tinges his re-reading of 
D'Urfey's Bonnie Dundee." 

A precisely similar sentence sums up or 



84 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



lumps up " The Tea Table Miscellany " of 
Allan Ramsay (p. 410). Of minor matters of 
style, such verbal forms as " strenuUy," " re- 
joicements," " artificiosity," instead of the 
usual words, may be good North British, but the 
contractions "wasn't," "isn't," and "can't" 
are undignified in any serious writing. Anent 
North Britain, the transatlantic reader has his 
" Marmion " to explain North Berwick Law, 
produced by the " Gyre-Carling," the mother- 
witch of Scotland, to discomfit her lover, but 
what was the " whikey " tree which grew in 
Robert Henryson's orchard? 

Instead of furnishing a glossary of Scottish 
words, Mr. Henderson writes the glosses in the 
margin. This is well enough for general pur- 
poses, but for the use of students there should 
be something to indicate the connection be- 
tween word and definition ; and the proof- 
reading should have been done by someone 
with a correct eye for lines and leads. Some 
of the glosses are hopelessly askew. Titles 
throughout are not glossed, for some inexplica- 
ble reason. We note one or two slight errors. 
On p. 391, Robert Sempill, author of " Habbie 
Simson," was active in promoting the Restora- 
tion, not the Revolution. On p. 394, a tangled 
sentence executes George Baillie of Jerviswood, 
husband of Lady Grizel Baillie, instead of his 
father, Robert Baillie. 

Mr. Henderson is at his worst in his index, 
which does not seem to have been prepared 
upon any system. It is fairly inclusive as to 
names, but titles get into it by favor and grace 
only. To instance a few eccentricities of index- 
ing : we look in vain for " The Lament of the 
Makaris," a poem which is probably mentioned 
oftener than any other, because it is a store- 
house of information on the early Scottish 
poets. Nor do we find the best-known Scotch 
song, " Auld Lang Syne," although " The 
Gaberlunzie Man," barely referred to, is 
indexed. " The Wowing of Jok and Jynny " 
is indexed twice : incorrectly as " Jok and 
Jynny " (p. 289-290), where there is some 
account of it, but correctly at p. 133, which 
points to a cross-reference. So the unwary 
reader who wants to turn to " Tullochgorum," 
" the best Scots song Scotland ever saw," in 
Burns's extravagant praise, must know before- 
hand that it was written by one John Skinner. 

But the faults of this book are few, and 
easily remedied ; its merits are many and great, 
and Mr. Henderson is to be congratulated on 
having produced a good book on a difficult 
subject. MART AUGUSTA SCOTT. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



Mr. Marion Crawford has again made one of his 
occasional excursions into the historical past, and 
told us, in his " Via Crucis," a story of the Second 
Crusade. His central figure is that of Queen 
Eleanor, the queen of the monkish Louis VII., 
linked afterwards to English history as the wife of 
Henry Plantagenet, and to romantic tradition as 
the jealous persecutor of the fair Rosamond. Stu- 
dents of English history are apt to learn little of 
her career as the consort of the French crusading 
monarch, or of that most picturesque episode which 
concerns her Amazonian masquerade, in company 
with a train of court ladies, across Europe to the 
East. It supplies a singularly effective subject for 
a romance, and Mr. Crawford has made good use 
of it. The hero is a fictitious character, a young 
Englishman who is made landless during the tur-

bulence of the strife between Stephen and the daugh- 
ter of Henry I., and who seeks to carve out for 
himself a new fortune by joining the crusaders. 
The story is chiefly concerned with the fruitless 
efforts of the enamoured queen to withdraw him 
from allegiance to his early love, but his faith 
proves too steadfast to yield to this temptation. 
Other historical figures are those of Arnold of 
Brescia and St. Bernard. The romance is excel- 
lently told, although it is not without longueurs and 
produces something of the stucco-effect which seems 
inevitable when such a theme is handled by any 
but the greatest of novelists. 

" The Tempest " has clearly been the inspiration 
of " My Lady and Allan Darke." The scene is an 
island off the coast of Virginia, the time something 
over a century ago. Prospero is a gentleman who, 
having been accused of a crime of which he is guilt- 
less, has taken refuge upon the island, and eventu- 
ally becomes monarch of all he surveys, including 
the plantation and slaves of the former owner, 
whose daughter he marries. Here his own daugh- 
ter (our Miranda) grows up in maidenly seclusion, 
not knowing the full tale of the past, and hither 
Allen Darke (our Ferdinand) is brought by the 
accident of shipwreck. Now Allan, unwitting of 
all this history, is really the one whom Prospero 
most fears, because he is by birth the natural avenger 
of the crime with which Prospero is wrongfully 
charged. Declaring his name, his protestations of 
ignorance avail him no whit; his life is spared, but 
he is kept a close prisoner on the island. Over and 
over again he escapes a treacherous death at the 
hands of a too zealous servant of Prospero, and in 
the end, when the latter dies, and all the mystery 
is cleared away, wins the love of My Lady, and the 
story ends happily. It is a really fascinating bit 
of romance, original (except for its admitted pro- 
totype) in design, and carried breathlessly on 
through many thrilling episodes to the conclusion 
that no experienced reader needs to be told is 
coming. 

For a professional man of peace, Archdeacon 
Brady has a very pretty taste in scrimmages. He 
prefers them by water, and the mere thought of a 
sea-fight is enough to heat his blood to the boiling 
point. In his new story, " For the Freedom of the 
Sea," he has a theme after his own heart, and he 
writes of the glories of Old Ironsides with an en- 
thusiasm that is wholly unaffected. The War of 
1812 supplies the subject-matter of this romance, 
and the fight between the " Constitution " and the 
" Guerriere " is but one of a series of episodes that 
keep the interest wide awake. The author is as yet an 
amateur novelist, to be sure ; he elaborates too much, 
and his style is far from impeccable, but there is an 
honest manliness about his work that compels both 
respect and admiration. 

" In Old New York," the romance which we owe 
to the collaboration of Mr. Wilson Barrett and Mr. 
Elwyn Barren, is a story of the year 1745, the time 
of the siege of Louisburg and of the Young Pre- 



tender. These happenings, however, only appear 
in the story as echoes from distant lands, although 
the fortunes of one of the characters are directly 
affected by the news of the Jacobite rising in Scot- 
land. The story is really concerned with the social 
and commercial life of Manhattan Island at a time 
when the city was mewing its mighty youth, and 
the possibilities of its future were becoming revealed 
to the far-seeing eyes of its shrewd Dutch and En- 
glish inhabitants. It is a well-constructed novel of 
private interests, with a charming heroine, and a 
pair of heroes who, if not charming, are at least 
interesting, and in quite different ways. Although 
Mr. Barrett's name stands first upon the title-page, 
we find more of Mr. Barron in the book itself 
more, that is, which seems attributable to the author 
of " Manders " than to the author of " The Sign of 
the Cross." 

" The Favor of Princes " is a variant upon a very 
hackneyed theme. An impoverished young noble- 
man comes to Paris to seek his fortune at court. 
The time is that of Louis XV. and the ascendancy 
of the Pompadour. He marries a wealthy woman 
of bourgeoise extraction, actually falls in love with 
her, and finding a rival in no less a man than the 
King, defies that august personage, and wins his 
point by virtue of sheer audacity. The story is with- 
out originality, and is told in too commonplace a 
manner to excite more than a languid interest. 

In writing " The Grand Mademoiselle," Mr. 
James Eugene Farmer has gone far beyond his first 
historical romance, " The Grenadier." He has 
learned, for example, to mix historical fact with his 
narrative much more skilfully, and to impart to his 
work much more of vivacity and animation. His 
subject is, of course, the Fronde, and the character 
of Mademoiselle de Montpensier seems to have 
inspired him with great enthusiasm. He tells of her 
audacious entry into Orleans, and of her brilliant 
although ineffectual defence of Paris against the 
forces of Mazarin and the young King. The author 
displays a fertile invention in the devices with 
which he embroiders the pages of history, as well as 
a certain talent in the portraiture of the numerous 
historical characters who figure in his tale. 

From seventeenth century Paris, as described in 
the foregoing romance, to eighteenth century Lon- 
don, as depicted in Sir Walter Besant's "The 
Orange Girl," is a transit to be measured otherwise 
than in leagues of land and sea. The latter, too, is 
a historical novel, in a sense, but it is social rather 
than political history that concerns us. Newgate, 
the debtor's prison, and the details of a criminal 
trial, are Sir Walter's themes, and he writes of 
them from that intimate knowledge of Old London 
with which few may hope to compete. There is 
more matter in this book than the author has been 
wont to give us of late, more antiquarian detail and 
more dramatic incident. And it is by a true artistic 
instinct that he takes us at the end, in company 
with his chief characters, across the ocean to the 
Virginia colony, and provides a peaceful epilogue

to his story of crime and degradation. The mem-

tures : a man, an enterprise, and an intrigue. The 
man has been indicated, the enterprise is the Cape 
to Cairo railway, the intrigue is supplied by political 
conditions in Cairo, in which town the whole scene 
is laid. The designing young woman who has set 
her cap at the hero, and who insinuates herself into 
the intrigue for the purpose of helping him with 
the enterprise, excites little admiration and less 
sympathy. Nor is the figure of the Colossus half 
as impressive as the author evidently believes it to 
be. He affects a pretentious style, and succeeds 
only in producing an impression of futility. 

The " Monte Cristo " type of story has an inex- 
haustible interest. There are so many things that 
can be done by a man in possession of an enormous 
fortune, and so wide a field for the ingenuity of the 
novelist dealing with such a case, that the plot of 
such a story never becomes hackneyed. In " The 
Princess Xenia," the fortune falls to an Englishman 
living in impecunious obscurity in a small German 
duchy, presumably in the pre-imperial days. He 
seeks to make himself the arbiter of destiny, both 
for this and the two adjoining petty states, and 
would combine them under one rule as a barrier 
against the Prussian policy of encroachment. In 
this design he almost succeeds, but the achievement 
is wrested from him at the very moment of triumph 
by the act of a passionate woman the inevitable 
and incalculable woman, with whom both fiction and 
actual life have to reckon in some unexpected 
fashion. There are intrigues manifold, and peril- 
ous adventures without number, from which entan- 
glement the hero barely escapes in the end, carrying 
with him the dispossessed princess, who seems to 
count the world well lost for the love of such a man. 
It is all delightfully and improbably entertaining. 

Mr. Bernard Capes is becoming so completely 
the victim of his mannerisms that he is well-nigh 
unreadable. He is so inoculated with the Mere- 
dithian microbe that his style has become hope- 
lessly strained and obscure, while such a matter as 
coherency of plot seems altogether unworthy of his 
attention. " Our Lady of Darkness " is the book 
which occasions the present strictures. It is a ro- 
mance of the French Revolution, with English and 
Belgian episodes, and is carried through a bewilder- 
ing series of happenings to a most futile conclusion. 

The " Siren City " of " Benjamin Swift " is more 
interesting as a story than any of its three prede- 
cessors by the same hand, although it is not without 
that infusion of bitterness which so marks the work 
of this singularly powerful writer. The heroine is 
a woman whose purity and strength are brought 
into effective contrast with the sordid influences that 



surround her innocent life, and turn her romance 
into the darkest of tragedies. Superficially, this 
novel is the story of an English girl who becomes 
the prey of an Italian fortune-hunting adventurer. 
Psychologically, it is a study of the interrelations of 
a group of intensely passionate natures in which 
virtue is beset by villainy, but remains invincible. 
The Neapolitan setting of the best part of the work 
lends it an added external glamour, and its study 
of Italian character is no less subtle and penetrating 
than its dealings with English persons and scenes. 
The style is admirably direct and tense, at moments 
rising to the heights of a grave and restrained 
beauty. Altogether, the writer appears more than 
ever one to be reckoned with, and already displays 
evidences of a more softened humanity than has 
heretofore been discernible in his cynical envisage- 
ment of modern society. 

Those who remember Lord Ernest Hamilton's 
" Outlaws of the Marches," with its striking depic- 
tion of the fifteenth century feuds of the Scotch 
border, will hardly be prepared for the surprise that 
awaits them in " The Perils of Josephine." No 
two novels could well be more dissimilar. The one 
was a stirring romance of the days of rough man- 
hood and hard fighting ; the other is a sensational 
melodrama of modern society, enacted in and about 
an English country house. We are led up by easy 
degrees to the extremely improbable plot against 
Josephine, but her perils, when they become really 
manifest, are quite as thrilling as the most exacting 
reader could wish. The author is a clever artificer, 
besides being a versatile one, and this his latest 
effort is a noteworthy example of its own peculiar 
sort of composition. 

" lone March," Mr. S. R. Crockett's latest ven- 
ture, is a most unhappy one. It is supposed to be 
a study in American girlhood, and what the writer 
does not know of the subject would fill many vol- 
umes. Such caricatures as those of the heroine and 
her girl friends are not often met with in fiction of 
serious intent, and such unrealities as the incidents 
which are strung together about the heroine belong 
strictly to the literature of burlesque. The story is 
one long and disjointed extravaganza, without a 
suggestion of real characterization, and without 
ordinary verisimilitude in its several episodes. We 
advise Mr. Crockett to go back to his moss-hags, 
and never again venture so far away from them. 

In shifting his activities from the field of histor- 
ical to that of domestic romance, Mr. S. R. Keightley 
has not been well-advised. " The Crimson Sign " 
and " The Cavaliers " were among the best recent 
examples of the former species of production, but 
" Heronford " is not thus distinguished among its 
many competitors. It is, however, a sufficiently 
stirring tale of an old English family, and leads up 
to certain culminating episodes that are sufficiently 
improbable to meet the most exacting of romantic 
demands. And it must be added that in matters of 
minor craftmanship, Mr. Keightley's hand has even 
gained something of deftness.

THE DIAL 



87 



Since " God's Prisoner " came into our hands 
some months ago, the name of Mr. John Oxenham 
has been one that could not go disregarded upon 
the title-page of a book. His " Rising Fortunes," 
which has just been published, is not equal in inter- 
est to its predecessors, but it is an enjoyable story. 
It is essentially a story of the " literary shop " as 
it exists in London, with its attendant commercial- 
ism, and log-rolling, and mean rivalries. The heroes 
for there are two of coordinate rank are young 
Scotchmen who, attracted by what Dr. Johnson 
called the noblest of all prospects, start for the 
metropolis with little other provision than their 
undaunted ambitions. How they gradually secure a 
foothold, and eventually achieve success the one 
in art and the other in literature is the substance 
of the narrative which the author unfolds. The 
book has a grasp upon reality, which is much, and 
its ideas are wholesome, which is more. 

We cannot say that there is much of either 
reality or wholesomeness in Mr. Guy Boothby's 
" Love Made Manifest." Here again is a young 
man of letters, but the struggle is lacking, for he 
writes a play in a single night, has it accepted in a 
single interview, and becomes almost immediately 
the most popular author of the day. So much for 
the question of reality. We have but to continue 
our summary to dispose of the question of whole- 
someness. Our meteoric author is rashly and un- 
happily married, and, in the full flush of his success, 
meets a woman a childhood friend who is in 
like case. The conventional conscientious pose is 
maintained for a time, but in the end they run away 
together, and make a home on a lonely island in the 
Pacific. Presently they both experience religion of 
the hysterical sort, and, in expiation of their sins, 
repair to a leper colony, and there end their lives. 
This is sad rubbish, although candor compels the 
admission that the book is somewhat better written 
than the Dr. Nikola stories. 

Mr. Quiller-Couch has a genius for titles. All of 
his books bear names that fascinate, and the latest 
of them is the happiest of them all in this respect. 
" The Ship of Stars " might mean so many things, 
and has about it such an atmosphere of mystery 
and poetical suggestiveness. The book itself seems 
to us the masterpiece among all that the author has 
produced hitherto. It is a tale of the Cornwall 
coast, of which the landscape, the customs, and the 
quaint folk are now so familiar to us through the 
ministrations of this gifted story-teller. The ele- 
ments of which it is compounded are various, recall- 
ing Mr. Hopkinson Smith in the lighthouse episode, 
" Jude the Obscure " (although with no touch of the 
bitterness) in the brief sojourn of the hero at Ox- 
ford, and " Sentimental Tommy " in the delineation 
of a boyish imagination, and the slow moulding of 
a character strong enough to react upon environ- 
ment and conquer it. There is something so abso- 
lutely clean and wholesome about this story of duty 
done for its own sake, so high and fine in the ideal- 
ism with which it is informed, that we may once 



more take heart for our fiction-literature, in spite of 
the meretricious and brutal forces that sometimes 
seem so hopelessly in the ascendency. What a 
refreshing contrast is here offered to such books as 
" The Christian " and " Stalky & Co.," to name two 
conspicuous illustrations of the degrading tendencies 
to which we have reference. It is the whole dif- 
ference between art and fustian. " Lord, make men 
as towers " is the prayer which here serves as a text, 
and in the spirit of that fine aspiration the book is 
written for the bettering of men's lives and the 
bringing back into literature of a large sanity and a 
worthy purpose. 

To the coast of Cornwall or rather beyond it to 
the Scillies we are also taken by " The Watchers," 
a story by Mr. A. E. W. Mason, which follows close 
upon the two that we reviewed only a few weeks ago. 
The story is, however, a disappointment, being little 
above the level of the " shilling shocker," and de- 
pending for its mystery upon that cheapest of all 
sensational devices hypnotic influence. This and 
a buried pirate treasure are the mainsprings of what 
must be described as an irritating and grossly 
improbable invention. It is a story of the eight- 
eenth century, but the special coloring of the period 
is plastered upon the surface rather than worked 
into the texture of the narrative. 

The Cromwell period of English history appears 
to be an inexhaustible source of material for writers 
of historical fiction. Industriously as it has been 
worked, it still offers one of the most interesting 
opportunities for romantic exploitation. Women, as 
a rule, are not very successful in work of this sort, 
but an exception must be made of Miss McChesney, 
whose " Rupert, by the Grace of God " is a 
highly satisfactory narrative. The hero is, of course, 
the daring royalist leader, and the story is chiefly 
concerned with a conspiracy to persuade him into 
treason by the promise of the English crown. The 
scene is mostly in the west of England, and the inter- 
est culminates with the siege and capitulation of Bris- 
tol. A love story is worked in, as a matter of course, 
and all ends happily for the hero and the heroine. 

Mrs. Macquoid is a practiced novelist, but she is 
unwise in attempting historical romance. Her latest 
book, "A Ward of the King," is prettily enough 
written, but the plot is feebly developed, and its 
excitement proves to be of a very mild type. It is 
a French story of the Constable de Bourbon and 
the struggle which led to the disaster of Pavia. 
Public interests are, however, rather kept in the 
background, and the story is really about the tribu- 
lations of a young gentlewoman, beset by unscrupu- 
lous enemies, and saved in due course of time from 
their evil machinations. 

Among recent volumes of short stories, the new 
collection by Mr. Bret Harte occupies the first place. 
These tales have, however, little of the pristine 
freshness of their earlier predecessors, and it is be- 
coming more and more evident that the author's 
rich pay-streak is worked out. Even the familiar 
figure of Jack Hamlin is less engaging and impu-

dent than usual, and the other types introduced 
reveal only a weakening of the writer's grasp as his 
Californian past recedes farther and farther from 
his view. His improbabilities are too glaring to be 
accepted, now that they come to us unaccompanied 
by the old magnificent verve and picturesqueness of 
effect. The stories are eight in number. 

In Mr. Hopkinson Smith's small volume there are 
no less than eleven stories, but several of these are 
mere sketches of a few pages each. The interest is 
here in the author's own personality, for he does not 
strain after inventions, but rather chooses to portray 
his own experiences, with just enough imaginative 
coloring to save them from being tedious. They 
have an undoubted charm, in spite of their excess 
of sentiment, for they reflect a generous view of 
life, as observed by a man who is both artist and 
humorist. Several of them are based upon inci- 
dents picked up by Mr. Smith in his character as a 
lecturer, for of recent years he has added that occu- 
pation to his many others. 

Mr. Bliss Perry has reversed the order usual with 
writers of fiction in that he has turned to the telling 
of short stories after having won a considerable 
success in the full-fledged novel. At least, " The 
Powers at Play " is the first collection of stories by 
his hand that has come to our notice, and we sin- 
cerely trust it may not prove the last. He has a 
quick eye for the possibilities of an incident or a 
situation, and he serves it up with neatness and 
despatch. There are eight stories in the present 
volume, some very slight, others more elaborate, 
and all interesting. Their invention is excellent, 
and they are enlivened by whimsical humor or else 
touched with subtle pathos. Whichever of these 
two formulae is applied to the work in hand, it is 
deftly employed and effective. The first story, 
" His Word of Honor," seems to us on the whole 
the best of the eight, but a close second may be 
found in either " The White Blackbird " or " The 
Incident of the British Ambassador." 

Turning now to Dr. Charles Waldstein's " The 
Surface of Things," we find ourselves confronted by 
writing of a different sort from that contained in 
the preceding volumes of short stories. Admirably 
entertaining as those volumes are, they are dis- 
tinctly light literature, and lightness is the last 
quality to be predicated of Dr. Waldstein's work. 
Indeed, the elaborate and possibly a trifle too " im- 
portant " prefatory matter which accompanies these 
three studies in " the ethics of the surface " pre- 
pares the reader for a severer strain upon the philo- 
sophical intelligence than is really intended, and it 
is with something of a surprise to find, in one of 
the studies at least, the adumbration of a love-story. 
Dr. Waldstein's thesis for his work is written to 
illustrate a thesis may be briefly stated, for the 
most part in his own words. The interests of the 
modern civilized man have come to embrace so 
many things that the motives of the older fiction 
become every year more and .more inadequate to 
express the complexity of the social organism. 



" The relation of man to woman, love in all its 
phases and with all its consequences, the lust of 
power and gain, the struggle for empire or the strug- 
gle for existence, money, a successful career " 
these must give way in part to " the more abstract 
and intellectual interests of life " if the art of fiction 
is to remain the typical literary art of the coming 
century. " The novelists with whose theories I am 
at issue, it appears to me, always understand by 
life what I should call the life of prehistoric man." 
" Not only those who are the fullest and highest 
representatives of our culture and civilization, but 
even the simplest and humblest members of our 
modern occidental communities, have a variety of 
needs and desires, without which life would to them 
not be worth living, which are so far removed from 
the fundamental necessities of prehistoric people 
that they would appear barely to graze the surface 
of existence." Voila le grand mot lance. That 
is the sense in which Dr. Waldstein would have us 
take his title. " These needs appear to be on the 
surface, but in reality they form the very core of 
our conscious existence. Considerably more than 
half of our waking thoughts and aspirations are 
directed toward the satisfaction of them ; they have 
become fundamental to us, and we therefore need 
not appeal to the basal passions of life for their 
justification." In reading this plea, we think at 
once of the delicate work of Mr. Henry James, and 
the present writer reminds us of Mr. James at more 
than one point, but we must add that he strikes the 
note of a deeper intellectual sincerity, that his utter- 
ance seems to us much weightier. It is true that 
studies of this sort leave indistinct the border-line 
that separates the story from the essay, but this 
difficulty of classification need not concern us in 
view of the keen pleasure which they afford. Dr. 
Waldstein has opened what is almost a new vein in 
literature, and we trust that the present small vol- 
ume is but the earnest of what he shall yet accom- 
plish in the exploitation.

present century English history, in which the author 
and the translator disagree. Aside from the gen- 
eral question of translators' alterations, is not the 
conception of a distinguished French historian of 
greater importance to the student than the mere 
statement of more generally accepted opinion ? 
As to the book itself, it deserves most generous 
praise for simplicity of statement, clearness of in- 
sight, and for a just balancing of the various ele- 
ments that go to make up the history of a nation 
in any given period. Part I. is devoted to a do- 
mestic history of Europe since 1814, by nations ; 
Part II. treats of " certain political phenomena 
common to various European communities," as, for 
example, the growth and distribution of ideas of 
state socialism ; Part III. is given up to an exam- 
ination, for all Europe, of such details of military 
and diplomatic history as have not already been 
touched upon in previous pages. A most interest- 
ing chapter at the present time is that entitled " The 
Parliamentary Republic " the concluding one in 
the domestic history of France because of the 
author's insight into secret political conditions, and 
because of his supreme faith in the permanence of 
the Republic. Especially noteworthy is his defense 
of the custom of interpellations. The present gov- 
ernment, says Seignobos, is anomalous in that 
France is governed by men chosen on the demo- 
cratic principle of election, while it is administered 
by a beaureaucratic official class, imperial in its 
organization, and in part independent of public 
opinion. The politicians labor to please the people 
upon whose votes their political existence depends ; 
the officials " tend to see in the citizens subjects of 
administration who must be kept in due submission 
to authority and regulations." While the politicians, 
as cabinet members, are at the head of official ad- 
ministration, they are quickly imbued with the 
spirit and attitude of the permanent office-holding 
class, and it then becomes the duty of Deputies, by 
interpellations, to hold them in check. Thus inter- 
pellations " are practical contrivances which enable 
two contradictory sets of institutions to exist side 
by side : a democratic political system and a per- 
manent administrative hierarchy. It compels the 
permanent officials to submit to the people's chosen 
representatives." It is a new argument, but it will 
hardly suffice to overthrow the weight of evidence 
against interpellations. 

Mr. William Archer is a man whose 
good opinion even a great nation of 
eighty millions of unprecedently well- 
fed, well-housed, and well-clothed people, like our 
own, may think worth having. We have pretty 
well gotten over our old provincial sensitiveness to 
foreign opinion. We do n't in general care a rap 
what the ordinary touring cockney or badaud 
may think or say of us. We did n't fume and fret 
and neglect our business when even Matthew Arnold 
found our cities " uninteresting," and hinted that 
Chicago, for all her culture and " sky-scrapers," was

still not exactly the Athens of Pericles. To be sure, 
Mr. Arnold came before the World's Fair, and 
never saw the bronze colossus that later kept watch 
and ward on the Lake Front and awed the soul of 
the approaching voyager, like the Athene Pro- 
machos on the Acropolis. But the pages of Mr. 
Archer's " America of To-Day " (Scribner) are quite 
free from that " certain condescension " we used to 
resent so hotly. He is pleased with us, and wishes 
us well ; but he does n't affect to look down benevo- 
lently on us. The only thing we have to complain 
of in his tone is that it is not quite free from that 
note of amused interest with which the Briton, time 
out of mind, has been wont to regard the outside 
world in general. But Mr. Archer's smile is a quiet 
one, and not in the least irritating ; so we can well 
afford to let him enjoy it. Mr. Archer's papers are 
stamped with a freshness of view, and a tendency 
to reexamine and in some cases to combat certain 
stock complaints about Brother Jonathan, that 
caused them to be rather freely quoted and can- 
vassed in England when they appeared serially 
for the book is a reprint of letters to London peri- 
odicals. His hardy defense of the " American Lan- 
guage," for instance, really shocked some of his 
English friends Mr. Lang, especially, whose 
nerves, originally none of the strongest, were quite 
upset by some of his fellow-critic's heresies. Mr. 
Lang's Scotch ear is ravished by the skirl of the 
bag-pipes ; but the American phrase " all the time " 
is enough to drive him out of the room. Mr. Archer 
has divided his text under two captions " Obser- 
vations," under which are grouped the more purely 
descriptive letters reflecting his impressions of New 
York, Boston, and Chicago, of American hospitality, 
American character and culture, etc.; and " Reflec- 
tions," a series of thoughtful papers on " North and 
South," " The Republic and the Empire," " Amer- 
ican Literature," and " The American Language." 
He especially relishes the American humorous anec- 
dote, and has gathered some choice specimens for 
English consumption, notably that of the rustic 
Kentuckian who, leaving the theatre after witness- 
ing Salvini in " Othello," warmly observed : " It was 
a good show a mighty good show; and I don't 
see but the coon did as well as any of 'em."

will be remembered, as originally planned, called 
for the completion of the work in five volumes. But 
the appearance of much new matter bearing upon 
naval events and developments of the present cen- 
tury has rendered a sixth volume necessary to the 
promised completeness and comprehensiveness of 
the work. The completion of the History, Mr. 
Clowes hopes, will not be much delayed by this ex- 
tension, material for Volume V. being already in 
type. We gladly testify to the abundant evidences 
of painstaking research and collation manifest in 
the work of Mr. Clowes and his competent colaborers. 
The distinctive plan of the work, that is to say, 
the parcelling out of specific phases and periods 
among writers specially qualified to deal with their 
respective allotments, whatever its obvious draw- 
backs from the literary point of view, has undoubt- 
edly conduced to accuracy and despatch, and will 
result in the production of a book which will long 
serve as the standard one for reference and appeal. 
The illustrations are, as before, profuse and hand- 
some, the most notable plate being a very strong 
and attractive portrait of Nelson after an original 
painting never before reproduced. The volumes 
are separately indexed. 

Dark pictures of Aside from a not unsuccessful effort 
Yankee sailing to produce a readable "yarn," the 

ship* and officers. a j m of Mr Algx j Boy( j ? J Q hig book 

called " The Shellback " (Brentano's), appears to be 
to paint in the blackest possible colors the ways and 
characters of the officers of American sailing ships, 
not only now but some forty years back, when Mr. 
Boyd's own experiences of our merchant service 
were acquired. To-day, as in the sixties Mr. 
Boyd's literary sponsor, Mr. Robertson, assures us 
the terms "Yankeeship" and " Hellship " are 
synonymous ; and he goes to say : " Were the laws 
now on our statute books rigidly enforced, a large 
majority of American captains and mates would be 
sent to the penitentiary, and not a few to the gal- 
lows or electric chair." This is strong language, 
and, supposing it to be justifiable, it seems to imply 
that the gangs in the forecastles, with whom the 
wicked captains and mates necessarily served their 
time and got their notions of sea-discipline, must 
themselves be a pretty tough lot, and more amena- 
ble to hard knocks than moral suasion. For our 
part, we are inclined to think the common seaman 
suffers in general more from the rascally parsimony 
of stingy shipowners than from the brutality of 
mates and captains. There is at all events this to 
be said for the officers of a deep-water ship : they 
are very commonly under the absolute necessity of 
aweing into subjection ruffianly crews of potential 
mutineers who outnumber them twenty to one ; and 
if they resort to rough measures it is fair to pre- 
sume that they do so quite as much from their 
knowledge of the men they have to deal with as 
from mere wanton cruelty. Mr. Boyd's book is a 
readable one, of a rather lurid and sensational order, 



and it is clearly, as he claims, founded on personal 
experience ; but we are quite unwilling to accept 
the " Altamont," the " floating hell " on which he 
sailed as an apprentice-boy from Melbourne to 
Liverpool, as a representative American merchant 
ship, or her fiend incarnate of a captain as the typ- 
ical Yankee skipper. There are several illustrations. 

The technical That quaint little treatise on " The 
processes of Art of the Old Masters " written by 

the old masters. Cennino Cennini of Padua in 1437 
has been well re-translated and editorially supple- 
mented by Mrs. Christiana J. Herringham, and pub- 
lished in attractive form by Mr. Francis P. Harper. 
In his " Trattato," Cennino, himself a painter and 
a pupil of Agnolo (son of Taddeo) Gaddi, describes 
the technical processes of his time the technique, 
that is, of the great masters of the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries, from Giotto, Fra Angelico, and 
Memmi, down to Botticelli, Benozzo Gozzoli, Ghir- 
landajo, etc., and tells how his contemporaries 
ground and mixed their pigments, painted their 
pictures and miniatures, tinted their papers, made 
their varnishes, laid on their gold, and so on. For 
example, says the " Trattato '': " If you would make 
a changing drapery in secco, cover it with a flat tint 
of lake ; use flesh-color for the lights, or, if you 
will, giallorno. Glaze the dark parts as you like 
with pure lake, or purple (bisso), with tempera." 
The extract may serve to indicate the scope and 
uses of the book, which is a mine of detailed inform- 
ation as to the materials and processes of the time 
and school. In translating Cennino Mrs. Herring- 
ham has two predecessors, Mrs. Merrifield, and the 
German, Ilg. In the two older versions, especially 
the English one, inaccuracies have been found. 
Mrs. Herringham's practical knowledge of the pro- 
cesses described in the treatise has assisted her in 
making a translation free, at least, from technical 
errors. There is an Appendix containing some 
useful notes on mediaeval methods.

novelist is so original and individual that the life is 
of more permanent interest than the letters. We 
shall never be quite satisfied with what we know 
about Poe the man ; the story of Byron's stormy 
career will never cease to have attractions for us, 
and Gulliver must always be of less moment than 
Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's. Among 
such names as these we must number that of Oliver 
Goldsmith, whom we cannot cease to love, however 
much or little we may care for " The Deserted Vil- 
lage," or " She Stoops to Conquer," or " The Vicar 
of Wakefield." In his memoir of Goldsmith (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), Mr. Austin Dobson gives us just so 
much of his life as most readers will care to know. 
He tells the history of his checkered career with 
the easy skill that makes it seem a story of romantic

reality, duly authenticated by frequent reference to 
Johnson, and Garrick, and Reynolds, and the 
"Jessamy Bride," but a story still. There is 
abundant record of pounds and guineas and other 
things not distinctly literary, here (by some magic of 
the pen) given a decidedly literary flavor. And there 
is record, too, of lack of pounds and guineas and other 
things prosaic, perhaps even more certainly literary 
and serving as a thread on which the memoir strings 
in close sequence the irregular happenings of Gold- 
smith's life. It is something to have so lived as to 
make possible such a biography so written. Whole- 
souled kindness and persistent cheeriness glow in 
its pages, and these are things of which we can 
never have too much, whether in men or books. 

Mr. Oliver Elton's work on " The 
Augustan Ages " (Scribner), written 
for the " Periods of European Lit- 
erature " series, is the most readable of the four 
volumes thus far published in that collection, and 
is at least not inferior to any of the others in point 
of scholarship. Mr. Elton's period begins, roughly, 
about the middle of the seventeenth century, and 
ends, more roughly, with the first quarter of the 
eighteenth century. In France, it deals with the 
great names of Bayle, Bossuet, Mme. de Se'vigne', 
La Bruyere, La Fontaine, Boileau, and the three 
dramatists. In England, it includes Hobbes, Bun- 
yan, Dryden, the Restoration drama, Defoe, Pope, 
Addison, and Swift. Six chapters of the work are 
given to French and English literature. A seventh 
surveys the literature of Germany, Holland, and 
the Scandinavian countries, with an excellent state- 
ment of Holberg's work and significance ; an eighth 
deals with Italy and the Peninsula, finding only 
Filicaja and Molinos even among second-class 
names, and a ninth briefly summarizes the whole 
work. No man could cover such a field as this 
without exhibiting many shortcomings, and the au- 
thor frankly acknowledges his dependence upon 
the standard histories for some of the outlying re- 
gions of his survey. He has certainly performed a 
difficult task in a more than creditable fashion, and 
we place the book beside its fellows with much sat- 
isfaction. 

A late contribution to the literature 
William Perm. ^ *^ e school of exact description of 
historic characters is " The True 
William Penn" (Lippincott),by Mr. Sydney George 
Fisher, an earnest student of men and matters con- 
nected with Pennsylvania. The volume takes its 
place with " The True Benjamin Franklin" by the 
same author, and " The True George Washington " 
by Mr. Paul Leicester Ford. In the case of William 
Penn, it was not possible to produce a very sensa- 
tional story, because he has not been so idealized 
as have the two others. The value of the biog- 
raphy does not consist, therefore, in the dissipa- 
tion of mists of error which have surrounded the 
founder of Pennsylvania, or, as Carlyle might 
put it, in " taking him down a peg." In place of 



Glimpses of

celebrities. 



this there is a very interesting description of the 
conditions of life in the time when Penn was grow- 
ing up, so that it is not at all difficult to understand 
how this youth, having chances to enjoy the gay 
career of a courtier, preferred to cast his lot with 
the persecuted Quakers. The changes in his thought 
as the panorama of his life shifted are admirably set 
forth. Both the frame and the picture are to be 
praised, and perhaps that is the most satisfactory 
thing that can be said of a biography. A writer 
has done well who gives a faithful presentation of 
the facts connected with an individual and his en- 
vironment, and this is what Mr. Fisher seems to 
have done in the story of the true William Penn. 

The pretty book containing an "Au- 
tobiographical Sketch of Mrs. John 
Drew" (Scribner) outlines the long 
career of that sterling actress and estimable woman, 
and glances briefly at many stage celebrities of by- 
gone days with whom her calling brought her in con- 
tact. T. P. Cooke, Maria Foote, Forrest, Madame 
Celeste, the Kembles, the Booths, Miss Cushman, 
Tyrone Power, Macready, Murdoch, Hamblin, Mrs. 
Shaw, and others, appear in Mrs. Drew's cheery 
pages, and their portraits serve to embellish and 
add interest to the volume. Mrs. Drew's slight 
mention of these older professional associates is sup- 
plemented by the Biographical Notes of Mr. Doug- 
las Taylor, in the Appendix. For Forrest the author 
has some kindly words, although she admits that he 
" was never a good-tempered man, and was apt to 
be morose and churlish at rehearsals." But he was, 
she adds, the " fairest " actor that ever played. " If 
the character you sustained had anything good in 
it, he would give you the finest chance of showing it. 
He would get a little below you, so that your facial 
expression could be fairly seen ; he would partially 
turn his back, in order that the attention should be 
given entirely to you." Mrs. Drew's somewhat 
meagre and sketchy narrative has been judiciously 
eked out in the editing, and the portraits are decid- 
edly interesting.

vince one that every religious denomination has 
connected with its history matters which are of

Of such works, the Lutheran Encyclopaedia (Scrib- 
ner), edited by Professor H. E. Jacobs and the 
Rev. J. A. W. Haas, is in many ways an admir- 
able example. The articles have been assigned 
apparently to the proper persons, and, to judge from 
the character of such articles as have been exam- 
ined, the work has been done conscientiously and 
with somewhat remarkable conciseness. One can 
hardly agree with all the positions taken in the 
general theological articles, which are unexception-

to-day to read the statement that conf essionalism is 
the most efficient protection from rationalism. But 
apart from such criticisms as this, the Lutheran 
Church is to be congratulated upon possessing such 
a complete and succinct record of its important 
men and actions. 

The series of pocket volumes, " The 
B ac n Biographies (Small, May- 
nard & Co.), continues to bear out 
the promises made by its earliest representatives. 
The latest additions to the series include the volume 
on Hawthorne, by Mrs. Annie Fields ; on Burr, by 
Mr. Henry Childs Merwin ; and on Frederick 
Douglass by Mr. C. W. Chestnutt. All of them are 
very readable, and the volume on Douglass is a 
capital illustration of the method of producing a 
clear biographical picture. Mrs. Fields's volume 
on Hawthorne is characteristically reminiscent, al- 
though very largely dependent upon the well known 
volume of her husband. Mr. Merwin's treatment 
of Burr impresses one with the feeling that the 
author began the study with the intention of not 
painting his character quite as black as he is usually 
painted, but found himself compelled to give up the 
struggle before his work was completed. Taken 
altogether, the three volumes are capital illustrations 
of how to write a small book, and the editor again 
is to be congratulated upon bringing so much uni- 
formity into a series which deals with such different 
subjects. 

A somewhat " ancient and fish-like 
smell " pervades Mr. W. H. Long's 
miscellaneous collection of old-time 
British " Naval Yarns " (F. P. Harper), although 
most of the matter is now for the first time printed. 
Over fifty documents or extracts from documents 
are given, some of them mere scraps from private 
letters and journals, and all of them narrating per- 
sonal experiences and adventures in the British 
Navy in the days of sail-power, when the gunner 
guessed at the range, and squinted across the sights 
of a piece that would have been about as effective 
as a catapult against the sides of a modern iron- 
clad. The most valuable paper in the book, " The 
Journal of a Surgeon " (1758-63), presents a 
graphic picture of life afloat at that period, and is 
worth preserving. There are several plates after 
paintings representing famous naval episodes and 
engagements. 

The curious collection of materials 

JS.1SK 1 b y Mr - Howard Pav8on A old 

published under the title " Historic 
Side-Lights" (Harper), make up a book, whose plan, 
if it has any, is not easily discovered, and whose 
purpose excites the increasing wonder of the reader. 
Hercules and George the Third may appear in one 
place ; while, in another, Trilby is appealed to, or 
" Mr. Dooley " is introduced with a characteristic 
sentence. From many a by-path of literature, 
quaint and curious material has been gathered, quite 
a large part of it relating more or less closely to 



Benjamin Franklin. The discourse is rambling and 
disconnected in the extreme, and while portions of 
it are interesting, and the illustrative details it fur- 
nishes may be valuable to a reader who is fond of 
anecdote or flippant phrase, it scarcely seems that 
serious history is really illuminated by such " side- 
lights " as these. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We have examined with much interest a recent pub- 
lication of the University of Minnesota. It is the work 
of Mr. Coiiway Macmillan, and has for its subject 
" Minnesota Plant Life." The work is intended for 
general reading rather than for text-book use, but is 
clearly to be taken as an educational publication in the 
large sense. After preliminary chapters on the soci- 
eties and the migrations of plants, the descriptive work 
is taken up, beginning with slime-moulds and algfe, and 
leading up to the most highly specialized forms of flow- 
ering plants. The volume contains 568 pages, and has 
for illustrations 240 figures and photographs (many of 
them of great interest and beauty) besides four full- 
page plates. Scientific names of species are not given 
as a rule (which we think a mistake), and there is no 
analytical key. We wish that every State in the Union 
might contrive to publish such a volume as this. 

A recent publication of the Field Columbian Museum 
of Chicago deserves more than a word of passing men- 
tion. It is a work on " The Birds of North America," 
by Mr. Charles B. Cory, and is a manual of the most 
practical character for the use of amateur ornithologists. 
The work is, in substance, an analytical key to the fam- 
ilies and species of all birds known to occur east of the 
ninetieth meridian; the descriptions are so plain as to 
make identification an easy matter even for the inex- 
perienced, and what is not made clear by the text is 
made clear by the many illustrations. Such a manual 
as this, inexpensive and easy of use, ought to do much 
toward popularizing the fascinating branch of natural 
history with which it is concerned. 

Mr. Thomas Newbigging, a student, and, we suppose, 
a stanch defender of the Stuart cause, has recently pro- 
duced a small volume on " The Scottish Jacobites " 
(London: Gay & Bird). While the greater part of 
the book is occupied with a brief narrative of the Jacob- 
ite risings and an account of their battles, the two most 
interesting chapters are those devoted to the fascinating 
songs and music which had their inspiration in the Lost 
Cause. The portraits and illustrations are really fine, 
and the wide margins and clear type make up a very 
attractive volume. 

The following are the latest text-books in the mod- 
ern languages: M. France's " Le Crime de Sylvestre 
Bonnard" (Holt), edited by Mr. C. H. C. Wright; 
" Letters of Madame de Sdvigne" " (Ginn), selected and 
edited by Professor James A. Harrison; "Contes Fan-

Dutton & Co. 

" Shirley " and " Villette," with introductions by Mrs. 
Humphry Ward, have just been added by the Messrs. 
Harper to their handsome " Haworth " edition of the 
Bronte sisters. 

An unusual sale for a new volume of poetry is that 
of Mr. Stephen Phillips's " Paolo and Francesca," 
which, it is stated by its publisher, Mr. John Lane, has 
already reached its eighth thousand. 

A monograph on " The English Income Tax," by 
Dr. Joseph A. Hill, is the latest issue in the series of 
" Economic Studies " published by the Macmillan Co. 
for the American Economic Association. 

Professor C. H. Herford's " Eversley " edition of 
Shakespeare, published by the Macmillan Co., is now 
brought to a close with the tenth volume, which contains 
" Coriolanus," " Timon of Athens," and the " Poems." 

The tendency of the American publishing trade to 
centralize in New York has for its latest illustration 
the removal of Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. from 
Boston to that city. Their new address is 426 and 428 
West Broadway, N. Y. 

"The Wider View," edited by Mr. John Monroe 
Dana, and published by the Messrs. Putnam, is an an- 
thology of short extracts in both prose and verse, em- 
bodying the higher aspirations and deeper religious 
thought of many great writers. 

The perennial vitality of Jane Austen is once more 
attested by the publication of a new edition of her 
novels. It is in the " Temple " format, occupies ten 
volumes neatly boxed, and bears the Dent imprint. The 
Macmillan Co. publishes the set in this country. 

The London " Academy " prize award for meritorious 
literature produced during the past year was divided 
into six parts, and the following persons were the ben- 
eficiaries: Sir George Trevelyan for "England in the 
Age of Wycliffe," Miss Gwendoline Keats for "On 
Trial," Mr. W. B. Yeats for " The Wind among the 



Reeds," Mr. H. H. Belloc for his biography of Dan- 
ton, Mrs. Garnett for her translation of Tourgue'nieff, 
and Mr. H. G. Graham for his " Social Life of Scotland 
in the Eighteenth Century." 

Miss Johnston's story " To Have and to Hold," 
which has aroused rather unusual interest while running 
as a serial in the " Atlantic," will be published in book 
form this month by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 
with illustrations by Mr. Howard Pyle and others. 

As a part of the reorganization of the business affairs 
of Messrs. Harper & Brothers, all the text-books here- 
tofore issued by that house will henceforth be issued by 
the American Book Company, of New York and Chi- 
cago, to whom all correspondence relating thereto should 
now be addressed. 

" The Growth of Sartor Resartus," by Prof. D. L. 
Maulsby, is a publication of Tufts College. It is a 
pamphlet thesis designed to show that the work in ques- 
tion had its roots in Carlyle's earlier work, and was, 
in fact, " an epitome of all that Carlyle thought and felt 
in the course of the first thirty-five years of his resi- 
dence on this planet." 

" Who's Who " (Macmillan) for 1900 has just made 
its appearance and will be welcomed by editors and 
other persons who are constantly needing up-to-date 
information about persons and things. We note the 
curious classification which puts down " The Atlantic 
Monthly " as a leading American newspaper. The infor- 
mation afforded upon English subjects is, we doubt not, 
more accurate than this. 

" Statistical Methods with Special Reference to Bio- 
logical Variation," by Dr. C. B. Davenport, is the title 
of a small volume published by Messrs. John Wiley & 
Son. It is issued " in answer to a repeated call for a 
simple presentation of the newer statistical methods in 
their application to biology," and contains the work- 
ing formula? most used in summer laboratories. The 
little book is bound in full leather, and will slip easily 
into the pocket. 

" Mythology for Moderns," by Mr. James S. Met- 
calfe, is a book issued by the " Life " Publishing Co. 
The text consists of a series of up-to-date versions of 
the ancient myths, as audacious as an Offenbach libretto, 
while many illustrations add their share to the enter- 
tainment offered. The same publishers have also sent 
us a thin quarto volume of " Coontown's 400," by Mr. 
E. W. Kemble. Here the pictures are the thing, and 
the text is reduced to brief explanatory notes. 

Mr. Thomas Hardy contributed recently the follow- 
ing verses, entitled " A Christmas Ghost Story," to a 
London paper: 

" South of the Line, inland from far Durban, 
There lies be he or not your countryman 
A fellow mortal. Riddled are his bones, 
But 'mid the breeze his puzzled phantom moans 
Nightly to clear Canopus fain to know 
By whom, and when, the All-Earth-Gladdening Law 
Of Peace, brought in by Some One crucified. 
Was ruled to be inept, and set aside? " 

The death of James Martineau, which occurred as 
our last issue was going to press, must not be passed by 
without at least a brief and belated word of mention. 
He had reached the great age of nearly ninety-five 
years, and had retained his intellectual vigor almost to 
the last. Among the leaders of nineteenth century re- 
ligious thought in England he towers like a giant above 
all save two or three, having, for his peers only such 
men as Newman and Maurice. Nominally a Unitarian,

bis outlook was too liberal to be confined even by that 
broad horizon, and it is hardly fair to apply to him any 
sectarian name. His life was spent in teaching and 
preaching, in Dublin, Liverpool, Manchester, and Lon- 
don. So engrossing were these activities that he pub- 
lished few books. Two volumes of college lectures, four 
of sermons, " A Study of Religion," and " Types of Eth- 
ical Theory," are all the publications that need be men- 
tioned. The last-named is his most important book, 
and is likely to live the longest. 

" The Empire of the South " is the title of an attract- 
ive and creditable work of some two hundred pages, 
written by Mr. Frank Presbrey and published with the 
cooperation of the Southern Railway. The book is a 
comprehensive treatment of the history, development, 
resources, and industries of the Southern States, with 
descriptions of pleasure and health resorts, and is illus- 
trated with five hundred photographs reproduced in 
half-tone. It appeals very strongly to those who have 
travelled in this interesting section of our country, and 
must prove of much value to the prospective traveller 
or investor. 

Mr. Frederick Furchheim has followed his " Biblio- 
grafia di Pompei" (see THE DIAL, 1895, Vol. XIX., 
p. 149) with a " Bibliografia del Vesuvio." This is by 
far the most extensive collection of titles relating to Vesu- 
vius that has ever been brought together. According to a 
summary given by the compiler in a footnote, the names 
of about 1000 writers are recorded, reference being 
made to more than 1800 books and articles. Italian writ- 
ers naturally claim the largest number of titles, 944 ; but 
the interest that the world in general has taken in the 
volcano may be measured by the fact that there are no 
less than 329 German, 257 French, and 180 English 
titles. The matter of the books and articles referred 
to covers a wide range; there are included technical 
treatises on the geology and mineralogy of the volcano, 
descriptions of eruptions, by eye-witnesses, and philo- 
sophical disquisitions on the volcanic phenomena, be- 
sides papers dealing with the history of the mountain 
from the earliest times. The titles are arranged in 
alphabetical order under the authors' names. At the 
end is a list of engravings and maps, followed by a 
chronological finding-list and an index. The volume 
is well printed, and altogether a valuable addition 
to the list of bibliographical helps. (Naples: Emilio 
Prass.) 

Richard Doddridge Blackmore, the author of " Lorna 
Doone," who died on the twenty-first of last month, at 
the age of seventy-five, had the misfortune to be con- 
sidered as a man of one book by a large section of the 
public. While it is probably true that the novel by 
which he was so widely known was his highest literary 
achievement, it is also true that he wrote other novels 
nearly as deserving of praise. " The Maid of Sker," 
for example, is a very close second, and such books as 
" Alice Lorraine " and " Springhaven " come not very 
far behind. Blackmore's rank among the novelists of 
the latter half of the century is very high. There was 
a time about twenty-five years ago, after the major 
Victorian novelists had passed away, when he seemed 
to overtop any of his contemporaries. At that time, 
neither Mr. Hardy nor Mr. Meredith had been discov- 
ered by the larger public, and Black appeared to be the 
chief rival of Blackmore. Besides the novels we have 
named, we may mention " Clara Vaughan " (his first), 
" Cradock Nowell," Cripps the Carrier," Crema," 
" Christowell," " Mary Anesley," and " Perlycross." 



He began his literary life, however, as a poet, a fact 
attested by three or four volumes of verse, and by a 
translation of two of the " Georgics " of Virgil. The 
last-named task was a labor of love, if ever there was 
one, for Blackmore's interests throughout his life were 
divided, like those of our own Mr. John Burroughs, 
between literature and gardening, if indeed gardening 
may not be named as his vocation, having literature for 
a mere avocation. His neighbors, in his country home 
a few miles outside of London, knew him as an expert 
grower of fruits and vegetables, having little idea of 
his fame in the world of letters, and many of the most 
delightful pages in his books derive their charm from 
his intimate acquaintance with the aspects of farm life. 
His command of a finished (if at times too rhythmical) 
prose style, his familiarity with the homely speech of 
the rustic, his sympathy with dumb animals, his tender 
human feeling, and perhaps also his fine old crusted 
conservatism, may be mentioned as the predominant 
characteristics of his books and his thought.

"THIS book is my dream child." 

Egerton Castle. 

Frederick A. Stokes Company announces a 
THIRD edition of EDGERTON CASTLE'S 

The Light of 
Scarthey 

The story is one of Adrian Landale, a young 
English nobleman of a hundred years ago 
"The days when in Liverpool the privateers 
were daily fitting out or bringing in the ' prizes ' 
. . . the days of war and the fortunes of war ; 
days of press gangs to kidnap unwilling rulers 
of the waves "; days of " the now rather incom- 
prehensible pursuit of gold-smuggling a ro- 
mantic subject if ever there was one." 

"It is no times of nowadays, no ordinary 
scenery that would suit such adventures as befell 
Adrian Landale or Captain Jack, or ' Murthering 
Moll the second,' " the chief characters in the 
story of the love and life of a light-keeper, "who 
was once a Dreamer of Beautiful Things." 

Size 4 3-4 by 7 1-2 inches, cloth, 456 
pages, $1.50. 

The Light of 



Scarthey 



" ' The Light of Scarthey ' has the charm of a 
daringly imaginative conception ; the poetry and 
dream of passion are in it ; the sunshine of ro- 
mance, the magic and picturesque situation are 
felt throughout its pages ; hut when we have 
reckoned with all this we are moved to a warmer 
admiration by the manner in which Mr. Castle 
makes his personages live, causes their adven- 
tures and their environment to seem as natural as 
they are new and exciting. . . . The book is full 
of vitality and atmosphere." N. Y. Tribune. 

" There is a charm about this story which is 
quite irresistible. . . . A beautifully wrought 
work of fiction a piece of art perfect and re- 
poseful as the marble of Antinous, yet full of 
strange and thrilling incident" 

Birmingham Post.

turesque descriptions, and bright, vivacious dia- 
logues." London Daily Telegraph.

DR. ELLIOTT COUES' 

WORKS ON WESTERIS^EXPLORATION 

Ready March 1, Dr. Cones' Final Work. 

ON THE TRAIL OF A SPANISH PIONEER. 

No. 3 of American Explorers Series. 
The Diary and Itinerary of Francisco Garce*s in his Travels through Sonora, Arizona, and California, 1775- 

1776. Now first translated from the original Spanish and carefully edited, with copious Notes, by Dr. COUES. 

18 maps, plates, and facsimiles. Edition limited to 950 numbered copies. 2 vols., 8vo, cloth . $6.00 net. 

Of the high historical value of this Diary of GarceVs there can be no adverse opinion, and the narrative of 
adventure will have all the charm of novelty. The largest corner of the United States seems to be the least 
generally known of all. To most persons Arizona is a vague name of a place in which there is a great chasm 
called the Grand Caiion of the Colorado, and where some strange Indians live like ants in a hill in places called 
pueblos. 

THE JOURNAL OF MAJOR JACOB FOWLER. 

No. 1 of American Explorers Series. 
Narrating an Adventure from Arkansas through the Indian Territory, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico to the source of 

Rio Grande del Norte, 1821-1822, now first printed from his original manuscript, carefully edited by Dr. ELLIOTT COUES. 

Plate. Edition limited to 950 numbered copies. 8vo, cloth . $3.00 net f 

An important and hitherto unknown exploration. He was the first white man to travel much of his route, including the 
ascent of the Arkansas as far as Pueblo, and trail through Colorado, Kansas, etc. 

" What Dr. Cones has already done fully entitles him to the unique and enviable position of historian of the early history of Western North 
America. His volumes attest his indefatigable energy and zeal in the work, and conscientious painstaking research, no less than his knowledge 
of the subject and his ability to handle it." The American (Philadelphia). 

" The value of the work [Fowler Journal] is very largely increased by nearly 180 notes by the editor, who is peculiarly well fitted for tha 
work by intimate acquaintance with the subject and previous experience in editing similar book*." The Rocky Mountain News. 

FORTY YEARS A FUR TRADER ON THE UPPER MISSOURI. 

No. 2 of American Explorers Series. 

The Personal Narrative of Charles Larpenteur, 1833-1872, now first printed from a hitherto unknown manuscript in the 
author's handwriting, with collations from various private journals, etc., by Dr. ELLIOTT COUES. 18 maps, plates, and 

portraits. Edition limited to 950 numbered copies. 2 vols., 8vo ' $6.00 net. 

"No man has done so much as Dr. Coues to accumulate and popularize knowledge on this subject [the fur trade]. His new edition of Lewis 

and Clark illuminated every page of the old one. The light thus thrown on the great fur rivers was scarcely greater than that he shed on the 

fur mountains and prairies by his three volumes on Pike, supplemented by another on Fowler.''^* Nation. 

"A notable and entirely novel contribution to our knowledge of the fur trade of the Upper Missouri, by one who has lived the life and 

worked his way through it from the position of a mere hand to that of one of its heads." Pioneer Prat. 

EXPEDITIONS OF ZEBULON MONTGOMERY PIKE, 

To the Headwaters of the Mississippi River, the Interior Parts of Louisiana, Mexico, and Texas, in the years 1805-6-7.

Large Paper 20.00 net, 

" On the whole, the new Pike must prove monumental. It will forever link its author with Pike's fame. Its map of Mississippi sources, and 
the arduous voyage [of the editor] into the farthest fountains, will not let us wonder that the Minnesota Park Commissioner styled a lakelet 
feeding Itasca, Elliott Coues, and inscribed that name upon a boulder on that utmost shore." American Historical Review (2% pages). 

_"Dr. Coues's new edition of 'Pike's Expeditions' is a beautiful specimen of presswork, most creditable to the taste and liberality of the 
publisher. The editor has done the material portion of his work as successfully as has the publisher ; the result is a well-digested and most 
readable chronicle, instead of ill-assorted bundles of information (as in the original edition). No explorer has ever been more fully aided to 
express himself through the ampler knowledges of the generations that come after him than in this case." The Dial (2% pages). 

NEW LIGHT ON THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE GREATER NORTHWEST. 

The Journals of Alexander Henry (Partner of the Northwest Company), with Explorations and Life with the Fur Traders 
on the Red, Saskatchewan, and Columbia Rivers, 1799-1814, now first published, with which are collated the original 
unpublished manuscripts of David Thompson, Explorer and Geographer of the Northwest Company. The whole carefully 

edited by Dr. ELLIOTT COUES. Limited edition, 3 vols., royal 8vo, $10.00 net. Large paper $20.00 net. 

Dr. Cones says of this work : " No work approaching these journals in the scope, extent, variety, and interest of its con- 
tents has appeared since the publication in 1801 of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's memorable voyages, and the present work will 
undoubtedly take rank with that classic as a veritable mine of accurate information." Send for complete prospectus. 

" The exceeding value of the work lies in the fact that it is new. Not for a long time has a book of such great historical interest been pub- 
lished in this country ... it should become a cherished book in the eyes of all those who take more than a passing interest in the early history 
of our country." ffew York Herald. _____________^_____

TWO FAMOUS NOVELS. 



IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE DE WILLOUGHBY CLAIM 

By FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT. 

35th Thousand. 12mo,$1.50. 

"IT is typically an American novel, which, in its subtle, 
1 tragic performance, lays a tremendous hold upon the 
reader's sympathies. The striking originality of the plot, the 
intensely dramatic climaxes, and the low, sweet thrills of 
happiness, in such direct contrast, give the book a weird- 
ness and fascination hard to shake off." Boston Herald. 



RED ROCK. 

By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. 

74th Thousand. Illustrated by Clinedinst. 

12mo, $1.50. 

" \\7HEN one has finished it, he finds in his mind a liv- 
" ing community of acting, breathing, and vital men 
and women, and that is saying that ' Red Rock ' is the work 
of a man of genuine artistic power. It is a contribution 
to onr literature because it is real ; because it deals, with a 
very dramatic period in American history." The Outlook.

To HAVE AND To HOLD 

By MARY JOHNSTON 

With Eight Illustrations by HOWARD PYLE, and Others. 
Crown 8vo, $1.50 

The first large impression of 25,000 copies was all ordered in January. A second 
large impression will be ready before publication, February 17. 

THE BOSTON JOURNAL says: 

" As a story of adventure, the book is without a rival in its own field, and it is extraordinary 
that when it is read as a whole, not month by month, the sensationalism which seemed to be 
the only thing which could be called a flaw, entirely disappears. As a love story the beauty 
and tenderness, the pathos, the delicacy, are unequalled, and as a narration, the wonderful 
word-pictures are a joy and delight. 

" Like a panorama the whole beautiful land of Virginia, Virginland indeed in those old 
days, lies before us. With willing feet we follow the actors through forest and wood, we float 
down the streams, we breathe in the odors, we see the colors of the flower and leaf, we watch 
the sun set, the moon rise, we feel the cool darkness of the mysterious night."

ships, its follies, as well as its heroisms and fidelities, its out- 
look on life, and its romance. Mr. Friedman's story shows 
the conscientious care with which he has observed life in this

BOOKS ON SOUTH AFRICA 



A WOMAN'S PART IN A REVOLUTION 

By Mrs. JOHN HAYS HAMMOND. 12mo, $1.00. 

"It will be recalled that in the troubles at Johannesburg (December, 1896) an American citizen, prominent 
at home and abroad, John Hays Hammond, was implicated and imprisoned. His wife proved a faithful friend 
and stood by him through it, and now gives her experience. It is a concise, clear review of the situation, sharp 
and pointed in its criticism, and withal lenient and lacking in the bitterness that would be expected. It is an 
interesting story, told with great vivacity and directness." Chicago Inter Ocean. 

SWALLOW A Tale of the Great Trek 

By H. RIDER HAGGARD. With 12 full-page illustrations. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

This is a story of life in South Africa, the period being that of the great "Trek," or migration of the Boers 
from British territory into a vast unknown laud peopled by savages and swarming with wild beasts. 

" A veritable work of art. The story itself is ... full of incident, yet without a single forced situation ; 
finally it gives us a most valuable insight into the character of the Boer, the history of the Transvaal, and the 
causes of Boer hatred and distrust of the Uitlander." The Bookman (New York). 

JESS 

A Novel. By H. RIDER HAGGARD. 12mo, 75 cents. 

" Jess " gives in the form of a romance a characteristic picture of the events of the English-Boer war of the 
winter of 1880 and 1881. The author is naturally partisan, and the position and sentiments of the English 
colonists or " Uitlanders " are strongly portrayed.

PARSON KELLY 

By A. E. W. MASON, author of "The Courtship of Maurice Buckler," etc.;

SPEAKER. " This is certainly a book to be read." 

SPECTATOR. " A book of more than common merit." 

REVIEW OF THE WEEK. "An excellent full-blooded romance. The quality of the story is its fine 
dramatic development, which keeps it so coherent a whole. It proceeds with the true dramatic sureness to 
an inevitable, admirable climax ; and the series of thrilling scenes at Lady Oxford's house in Queen's Square 
are among the most truly dramatic in romance." 

DAILY CHRONICLE. " The scene in Lady Oxford's drawing-room, where most of the characters in the 
story are got together, and the newsboys in the street outside are shouting out the discovery of a Popish plot, 
is a most admirable piece of comedy, with tragedy as a background. We never wish to read anything better 
of its kind. It is a veritable triumph of stage management, and of the art which conceals art. Distinctly 
the book is a success. To speak of ' Parson Kelly ' as though it were an effort of mere craftsmanship is to 
do it an injustice. It is very real artistry. One's interest is held all through." 

PALL MALL GAZETTE. " A brilliant novel. . . . The enjoyment of the book is so keen that it entirely 
absorbs one. . . . The Lady Oxford here presented is a brilliant, worthless ' strange woman,' who must 
henceforth take rank in fiction as a distinct, vivid character; and that the elaborate intricacy of cross purposes 
and cross currents that centred round her and the hero on the night when she gave her rout and George Kelly 
was arrested as a Jacobite, is as clever and as masterly a piece of work as one would wish to see. . . . The work 
is worthy of the combined brilliance of its authors; and Mr. Lang, whose position has long been established, 
will not grudge our saying that, above all, it sets the seal on Mr. Mason's remarkable talent."

"WHEN WE DEAD AWAKE." 

The publication of Dr. Ibsen's latest drama 
comes a year later than his long-established 
custom had led us to expect. Since the appear- 
ance of " An Enemy of the People " in 1882, 
every second year brought its new play until 
1898, when it was learned that no work was 
then forthcoming. Coupled with this announce 
ment was a report to the effect that the vener 
able dramatist had in view the writing of a 
volume of memoirs, but it seems that this pro 
ject, if ever definitely entertained, was aban 
doned in favor of another play, which duly came 
from the press late last December, and has re 
cently reached us. It is in three acts, bears the 
suggestive title, " Naar Vi Dode Vaagner, 
and is further described as " a dramatic epi 
logue." We are given to understand that this 
description means that the author has defi- 
nitely closed the series of problem -plays, or 
studies in social pathology, which was begun 
in 1878 with The Pillars of Society," and 
which is made an even dozen by the work now 
under discussion. One in search of fanciful 
analogies might find in that first title some 
suggestion of an intellectual Samson deter- 
mined to pull down the temple of modern so- 
ciety, and in the last some suggestion of the 
nobler social structure that may be expected to 
spring from the ruins of the old order. 

This is, of course, the merest fancy and 
nothing more, but it is the prerogative of Dr. 
Ibsen's work to suggest ideas that lie far afield 
from its direct message, and it is impossible to 
remain literal-minded in the presence of the ex- 
traordinary series of compositions now brought 
to an end. Their significance is none the less 
real because it is elusive, and their larger im- 
plications must determine our judgment quite 
as much as the nicety of their dramaturgical 
craftsmanship. " When We Dead Awake " 
is a title which in itself awakens many echoes 
from the author's earlier writings. It proclaims 
anew his whole insistent gospel of the need of 
spiritual regeneration for an age sunk in sloth 
fulness the gospel of Brand's 

" Forth I out of this stifling pit ! 
Vault-like is the air of it ! 
Not a flag may float unfurl'd 
In this dead and windless world "*

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



it sounds once more that note of high idealism 
which is never altogether missing from his 
work, and which is the real secret of the appeal 
which he has so powerfully made to all who 
have ever dreamed of the realization of Utopias 
and the permanent betterment of the social 
order. 

But, whatever aspirations may breathe 
through his symbolism, Dr. Ibsen never forgets 
that he is a dramatic artist writing for the stage, 
and that his first concern is the concrete pre- 
sentation of such men and women as we may 
at any time meet with in actual life. The new 
play opens in the most matter-of-fact way at a 
summer resort on the Norwegian coast. Pro- 
fessor Rubek and his wife Maja are seated 
outside the hotel. They have just finished 
breakfast and are reading the newspapers. 
Rubek is a sculptor of European reputation, 
who has returned to his native land after a 
lengthy sojourn abroad. Both are restless, and 
it soon transpires that neither of them has found 
satisfaction during the years of their married 
life. It is a case of the deeper sort of incom- 
patibility. An artist and a frivolous woman 
are joined together, and neither of them can 
give the other what is most wanted. To him 
has been denied inspiration for his work, to her 
the joyous round of gaiety which she craves. 
For years they have pretended a satisfaction 
they did not feel, but the breaking-point has 
nearly been reached. 

Maja. Tell me. You have begun to go restlessly about. 
You find contentment nowhere, either at home or abroad. 
Of late you have come to shun human society. 

Rubek. No, really ? Have you noticed that? 

Maja. No one who knows you could help noticing it. And 
it seems to me, it has grown so serious that you have lost all 
pleasure in work. 

Ilubtk. Have I done that ? 

Maja. Just think, you, who formerly could work so un- 
weariedly early and late ! 

Rubek. Yes, formerly, yes 

Maja. But from the time when your great masterpiece 
was once off your hands 

Rubek. " The Day of Resurrection " 

Maja. the one that bus gone all over the world, that 

has made you so famous 

Rubek. Perhaps that is the misfortune, Maja. 

Maja. Why so ? 

Rubek. When I had created that masterpiece of mine 
[making a passionate gesture], for "The Day of Resurrec- 
tion " is a masterpiece. Or it was at first. No, it is still. It 
shall, shall, shall remain a masterpiece ! 

Maja. Yes, Rubek, that is something which all the world 



knows. 
Rubek. 

nothing I 
Maja, 
Rubek. 



All the world knows nothing I Understands 



At any rate they imagine something. 

Something which isn't there, yes. Something 
which was never in my thought. They fall into an ecstasy 

over that. It isn't worth the while to wear yourself out 

for the mob and the crowd and for " all the world." 



Maja. Does it seem to you better, or even worthy of your- 
self to do nothing but a portrait bust now and then ? 

Rubek. They are not strictly portrait busts that I make, 
Maja. 

Maja. Yes they are, God knows, during the last two or 
three years, since your great group was completed and out of 
the house. 

Rubek. Yet they are not merely portrait busts, I tell you. 

Maja. What do you mean by that ? 

Rubek. There is something suspicious, something con- 
cealed, both inside and outside the busts something secret, 
that men cannot see. 

Maja. Indeed ! 

Rubek. But I can see it. And I get my quiet amusement 
out of it. Apparently there is the "striking likeness," as 
they call it, which people stand and gaze at with wonder [in 
a tower tone\ but deep within are traced the respectable, 
even honorable lineaments of the horse, or sometimes donkey 
snouts, and close-eared low-browed dog-skulls, and masked 
swine's heads, and the counterfeit presentment of brutal ox- 
faces 

Maja. All the domestic animals, in fact. 

Rubek. Just the domestic animals, Maja. All the animals 
that man has transformed in his own image, and that have 
transformed man by way of compensation. And these tricky 
works of art are what well-to-do people come and order of 
me. And pay for in good faith, and with high praises. 
Almost with their weight in gold, as men say. 

Maja [filling his glass] . Fie, Rubek ! Drink and be con- 
tent. 

Rubek. I am content, Maja. Really content. In a way , 
that is. [Pause.] For there is a certain happiness in feeling 
free and undisturbed on all sides. To have everything that 
one can think of desiring. Externally, I mean. Don't you 
feel as I do about it, Maja? 

Maja. Oh, yes, that is all very well, too. But can you 
remember what you promised me the day when we agreed 
about that difficult 

Rubek. Agreed that we should marry. It was a little hard 
for you, Maja. 

Maja. And that I should journey abroad with you, and 
live there for good and be happy. Can you remember what 
you promised me then ? 

Rubek. No, really I can't. What was it I promised you ? 

Maja. You said you would take me up on a high moun- 
tain and show me all the glory of the world. 

Rubek. Did I make you that promise too ? 

Maja. Me too? Whom besides? 

Rubek. No, no, I mean merely, did I promise to show 
you ? 

Maja. All the glory of the world. Yes, you said that. 
And all the glory should be mine and yours, you said. 

Rubek. It was a sort of phrase that I was in the habit of 
using in those days. 

Soon after this conversation, the two remain- 
ing characters of the play come upon the scene. 
One is a landed proprietor named Ulfhejm, 
the other is Irene, a pale, mysterious woman 
who turns out to be an old friend of Rubek 
no other, in fact, than the woman who had 
been his model for " The Day of Resurrection," 
and thus the inspiration of his best artistic 
effort. She is attended by a deaconess, a 
shadowy, silent figure, who speaks only three 
words at the very close of the drama. Ulf- 
hejm, who is an enthusiastic sportsman, is 
coarse of speech and unconventional in man- 
ner. Maja is attracted to him by his abundant 
animal spirits, and they plan a hunting expe- 



1900.] 



Ill 



dition. When they have gone off together, 
Rubek is left with Irene, and memories of 
the past come surging upon him. In the 
intimacy of their earlier relations, he had 
viewed her with the artist's eye only ; she, on 
the other hand, had loved him with all the 
strength of her passionate nature. To him she 
had been an episode ; to her he had been every- 
thing that makes life desirable. When they 
had parted she had become like " The Woman 
with the Dead Soul " of Mr. Stephen Phillips's 
poem. She had existed, but the vital spark 
had been extinguished within her breast. He, 
learning too late how great was his need of her 
inspiration, had made a prosaic marriage, and 
had discovered that the creative impulse had 
fled beyond his control. The situation is some- 
thing like that of " Master Builder Solness," 
when the appearance of Hilda reawakens in the 
artist the old aspirations and the old ideal 
visions. Irene reproaches the sculptor with 
having seen in her only the beautiful figure, 
not the loving woman's soul. 

Rubek. I was an artist, Irene. 

Irene. Just that, just that. 

Rubek. An artist first of all. And I was ill and would 
create the great work of my life. It should be called " The 
Day of Resurrection." It should be produced in the likeness 
of a young woman, waking from the sleep of death. 

Irene. Our child, yes. 

Rubek. She should be the noblest, purest, most ideal 
woman of earth, she who awoke. And then I found you. I 
could use you with complete satisfaction. And you submitted 
so willingly, so gladly. Left people and home, and followed 
me. 

Irene. It was my resurrection from childhood when I fol- 
lowed you. 

Rubek. That was just why I could use you. You and none 
other. You became for me a sacrosanct creature, whom I 
might touch only in the worship of my thoughts. I was still 
young then, Irene. And I was possessed by the superstition 
that should I touch you, desire you in reality, it would be a 
desecration, and put beyond my power the work that I sought 
to do. And I yet believe there is truth in that. 

Irene. First the work of art then the human child. 

Rubek. Judge of it as yon will. But I was completely 
controlled by my task at that time, and it made me jubilantly 
happy. 

Irene. And your task turned the corner for you, Arnold. 

Rubek. With thanks and blessings for you, it turned the 
corner for me. I sought to create the pure woman just as it 
seemed to me she must awake on the day of resurrection. 
Not surprised at anything new and unknown and undreamed 
of, but filled with sacred joy at finding herself unchanged 
she, the woman of earth in the higher, freer, more joyous 
lands after the long and dreamless sleep of death. So did 
I create her in your image I created her, Irene. 

Irene. And so you were through with me. 

Rubek. Irene ! 

Irene. Needed me no longer. 

Rubek. Can you say that ? 

Irene. Began to look about for other ideals. 

Rubek. But found none, none after you. 

Irene. No other models, Arnold ? 

Rubek. You were no model for me. You were the task 
set for my creative powers. 

Irene. What have you done since ? In marble, I mean. 
Since the day I left you ? 



Rubek. I have done nothing since that day. Merely trifled 
and modelled. 

Irene. And the woman with whom you are now living ? 

Rubek. Do not speak of her now. A pang strikes through 
my breast. 

Irene. Where do you think of journeying with her ? 

Rubek. Oh, some trip or other up the north coast. 

Irene. Journey rather high up among the mountains. As 
high as you can climb. Higher, higher, ever higher, Arnold. 

Rubek. Will you up yonder ? 

Irene. Have you courage to meet me once more ? 

Rubek. If we could ah, if we could ! 

Irene. Why can we not do what we will ? Come, Arnold, 
come up to me. 

" Why can we not do what we will ? " The 
whole of Ibsen is in that passionate question. 
Why does deed fall so far short of impulse ? 
Why do we cripple our lives by making them 
so much less than our ideals ? Noticeable also 
in this scene is the recurrence of the typical 
motive of " Solness," for as Hilda comes to the 
master builder, and recalls the past in such 
fashion as to rekindle his artistic energies, so 
Irene comes to the sculptor at a similar period 
of slackened will, and bids him once more be 
greatly daring. 

The two extracts thus far made are taken 
from the first act of the play. In the second 
act, Rubek and his wife, in sorrow rather than 
in passion, say some of the things they have 
long felt, and put into bare and almost brutal 
speech their attitude toward one another. After 
this discussion, Maja leaves the scene, meets 
Irene, and sends her to Rubek. 

Irene. She, the other woman, said that you were waiting 
for me. 

Rubek. I have been waiting for you year after year, with- 
out understanding it myself. 

Irene. I could not come to yon, Arnold. I lay far yonder, 
sleeping a long, deep, dreamful sleep. 

Rubek. But now you are awake, Irene. 

Irene. Yet deep and heavy sleep is still upon my eyes. 

Rubek. It will dawn and grow bright for us both now, you 
shall see. 

Irene. I can never believe that. 

Rubek. I believe it ! I know it ! For now I have found 
you again. 

Irene. Arisen. 

Rubek. Transfigured ! 

Irene. Only arisen, Arnold, not transfigured. 

A long reminiscent scene between the two now 
follows, leading at last to this poetical and 
impressive climax. 

Irene Look, Arnold. Now the sun is sinking behind the 
peaks. Just see how red the slanting rays shine upon all the 
hilltops yonder. 

Rubek. It is long since I have seen a sunset on the moun- 
tains. 

Irene. And a sunrise ? 

Rubek. I think I have never seen a sunrise. 

Irene. I saw a wonderfully beautiful sunrise once. 

Rubek. Did you ? Where was it ? 

Irene. High, high up on a dizzy mountain top. You enticed 
me thither, and promised that I should behold all the glory of 
the world, if I would only 

Rubek. If you would only ? Well ? 

Irene. I did as you told me. Followed you up to the 



112 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



heights. And there I fell on my knees, and besought you 
and worshipped you. Then I saw the sunrise. 

The close of this act brings an appointment 
between the two to spend the warm bright 
summer night upon the heights. At the same 
time it must be remembered that Maja and 
Ulfhejm have planned a hunting expedition 
for that night also. 

Irene. Until to-night. On the upland. 

Rubek. And you will come, Irene ? 

Irene. I will truly come. Wait for me here. 

Rubek. A summer night on the upland. With yon, with 
you. Oh, Irene, it might have been a lifetime. And we have 
wasted it, we two. 

Irene. We first come to see the irretrievable when 

Rubek. When? 

Irene. When we dead awake. 

Rubek. What is it we come to see ? 

Irene. We see that we have never lived. 

With the last act comes the inevitable tragic 
ending. The scene is laid high up among the 
mountains, with precipices on the one hand, 
and snowclad peaks on the other. The time is 
just before sunrise. Maja and Ulfhejm first 
appear, and after a long dialogue, come upon 
Irene and Rubek. A storm is brewing, and 
the note of warning is sounded by Ulfhejm. 

Ulfhfjm. Do n't you see that the tempest is over our head. 
Don't yon hear the gusts of wind. 

Eubek. It sounds like the overture to the day of resur- 
rection. 

Ulfhejm. It is the storm-wind from the peaks, man ! Just 
see how the clouds roll and descend. Soon they will close 
about us like a winding-sheet. 

Irene. Well do I know that shroud. 

Maja. Let us try to get down. 

Ulfhejm. I can help but one. Stop in that hut until the 
tempest is stilled. I will send people up to rescue both of you. 

Irene. Rescue us ! No, no ! 

Ulfhejm. To take you by force, if need be. It is a ques- 
tion of life and death. Now you know the truth. [To Maja] 
Come on, and trust to your comrade's strength. 

Maja. Oh, how I shall rejoice and sing if I get down with 
a whole skin. 

Ulfhejm. Just wait in that huntsman's hut until they come 
for you with ropes. 

Rubek and Irene are now left alone. The 
woman is in an ecstasy of terror at the thought 
of returning to the hopeless conditions of every- 
day life. She displays a dagger, and declares 
that she will not suffer herself to be rescued. 
She also confesses that she had meant the 
dagger for Rubek himself, that he might atone 
for all that she had suffered from his indiffer- 
ence and desertion. 

Rubek. Why did yon not strike ? 

Irene. Because the frightful thought came to me that you 
were already dead, long since. 

Rubek. Dead ? 

Irene. Dead, you as well as I. We sat there together, we 
two clammy corpses, and played together. 

Rubek. I do not call it death. But you cannot understand 
me. 

Irene. Where is now the burning desire with which you 
once fought, when I stood before you as the uprisen woman ? 

Rubek. Our love is surely not dead, Irene. 



Irene. The love which is the life of earth, the beautiful, 
wonderful life of earth, the mystery- haunted life of earth 
that is dead in us both. 

Rubek. Do n't you know that just that love is seething and 
burning in me as fiercely as ever before. 

Irene. And I. Have you forgotten what I now am ? 

Rubek. Be who and what you will. For me you are the 
woman I dream that I behold in you. 

Rubfk. We are free. There is yet time for us to live our 
life, Irene. 

Irene. The desire of life died within me, Arnold. Then I 
arose, and spied you out, and found you. And now I see that 
both you and life are lying dead, as I lay. 

Rubek. How are your thoughts astray ! The stir and the 
ferment of life are in us and about us as before. 

Irene. The young uprisen woman sees the whole of life 
upon its couch of death. 

Rubek. Then let us two dead live life once to the dregs, 
ere we go down again into our graves. 

Irene. Arnold ! 

Rubek. But not here in the twilight. Not here, where the 
wet, hideous shroud flaps about us. 

Irene. No, no. Up into the light and all the glittering 
glory ! Up to the peaks of divination ! 

Rubek. Up there we will celebrate our bridal festival, 
Irene, my beloved. 

Irene. The sun will see us gladly, Arnold. 

Rubek. All the powers of light will see us gladly. And 
all the powers of darkness. [Taking her hand] Will you 
follow me then, my gracious bride ? 

Irene. Willingly and gladly will I follow my lord and 
master. 

Rubek. We must first make our way through the mists, 
Irene, and then 

Irene. Yes, through all the mists, and so straight up to the 
towering peak, that gleams iu the sunrise. 

As the two pass upward hand in hand, the 
tempest increases in violence. The silent 
attendant of Irene appears and looks about for 
her mistress. The jubilant voice of Maja is 
heard from far below. Then, with a roar like 
thunder, an avalanche sweeps down the moun- 
tain side, and buries the devoted two in its 
depths. 

Such is the scene which, like the similar 
scene in " Brand," leaves us awe-stricken at 
the close of the drama. We leave to others 
the task of reading a lesson into this tragic 
presentment of two human souls thus brought 
to the crisis of their lives. Journalism and 
by journalism we mean the sort of writing 
which, whether found in newspapers or in 
books, invariably balks at every form of ideal- 
ism, and always, of the possible motives for any 
course of action, assumes the basest or the least 
worthy to offer the most rational explanation 
journalism, we say, will scoff at this story, just 
as it scoffed at " L'Abbesse de Jouarre " and 
" Die Versunkene Glocke," with both of which 
works this drama has suggestive affinities. But 
we pity the reader who can contemplate the 
situation here created by the genius of Dr. 
Ibsen, and find only prosaic emotions to feel, 
only prosaic things to say. An awful pity and

an awful sense of omnipotent fate seem the 
fitting subjective accompaniment of the tragedy 
here worked out with unerring objective mas- 
tery. In the presence of such creative power, 
of such a certain grasp upon the very core of 
passion, such an envisagement of the problem 
of life when stripped of all adventitious trap- 
pings, all criticism seems futile, and all com- 
ment superfluous. For this occasion, at any 
rate, we will remain content with the outline 
of the story that has been given, and with the 
illustrative extracts that have been translated. 
We understand that an English version of the 
drama, made by Mr. William Archer, will soon 
be offered to the public.

COMMUNICA TION. 

JANE AUSTEN AND THACKERAY. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

Your recent notice of Mr. Pollock's little book on 
Jane Austen recalls a story I happened to see in a New 
York journal last summer. " Mrs. Ritchie," it was 
remarked, " has presented somewhere a picture of the 
personality of Jane Austen. Miss Austen visited the 
Thackerays and took tea with them. Her hosts waited 
in vain for the brilliant conversation, or even intelligent 
remarks that they expected. Thackeray, before the 
evening was half over, made his escape to the club." 
The writer is wisely vague as to where Mrs. Ritchie 
relates this precious story, for it is impossible that she 
could have originated anything so absurd. Born in India, 
Thackeray, according to his own statement in "The 
Four Georges," " first saw England when she was mourn- 
ing for the young Princess Charlotte," who died No- 
vember 6, 1817. As Jane Austen had died the 18th of 
the previous July, it is obvious that the alleged meeting 
could not have taken place. But let us suppose that 
Thackeray's memory was at fault, that he reached En- 
gland somewhat earlier, and that the two novelists met: 
what then ? On the day of Jane Austen's death, Thack- 
eray had reached the ripe age of six; and it is safe to 
assume that the boredom was on the part of Jane Austen, 
and that Thackeray retired, not to the club, but to the 
nursery. ALBERT MATTHEWS.

Since earth was beauty first to human eyes, 

And truth grew wonderful in man's desire, 
No other soul has felt such longing rise, 
Such passion for them, as a living fire 
Of noblest aspiration making sweet 
The pathway of the dust for aching feet. 
Out of this earth his spirit-blooms unfold, 
As some pure lily from the age-black mould.

DEMOCRACY OUT OF JOINT.* 



Mr. Gamaliel Bradford owes such public 
reputation as he enjoys mainly to the numerous 
contributions that he has made, in the last 
thirty years or so, to certain leading journals 
of the country, in which he has freely criticised 
the course of our governments and confidently 
offered a specific remedy for the evils that have 
furnished the subjects of his criticism. He 
now comes before the public with an elaborate 
work, which comprises two volumes of more 
than eleven hundred pages, devoted to a much 
fuller and abler presentation of his well-known 
views. The range of his argument is very wide, 
and it is impossible in these columns to do more 
than to state his leading ideas. First, however, 
we must seize the author's point of view. 

Perhaps occasional readers, or even regular 
readers, of his newspaper lucubrations have 
formed the opinion that Mr. Bradford despairs 
of popular government. Not at all ; he is 
rather a thorough believer in democracy. On 
this point he takes pains not to be misunder- 
stood. He begins with the well-known yet 
almost astounding fact that " within little more 
than a century a force has made its appearance 
in the world which was never before known, 
and which, having already changed the whole 
face of society, points to still greater changes 
in the future "; the allusion being " not to a phys- 
ical but to a moral cause ; that is, the carrying on 
of government, if only in theory, in accordance 
with the expressed wish of the great mass of the 
people." His first chapter is devoted to histor- 
ical illustrations of this proposition. He ex- 
amines and thrusts aside " some criticisms of 
democracy " that have been made by such well- 
known writers as President Woolsey, Francis 
Parkman, and Sir Henry Sumner Maine, and 
asserts a confident faith in popular government. 
He insists that history furnishes no good reason 
for discarding it, but the contrary. If popular 
governments have made mistakes and fallen 
into excesses, so have all other governments 
since society began mistakes and excesses 
both greater and more numerous. At the same 
time, popular governments have been the source 
and cause of reforms and benefits of the most 
extended and beneficent character. The facts 
of history that he marshalls to support these 



* THE LESSON OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT. By Gamaliel 
Bradford. In two volumes. New York : The Macmillan Co.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



propositions, and particularly the last one, are 
extremely effective. Think of it ! when Black- 
stone wrote his " Commentaries " in 1760-70 
there were a hundred and sixty capital crimes 
underthe English law; up to 1838, poor debtors 
were immured in the miserable prisons of the 
time ; down to 1833, Parliament had done noth- 
ing whatever for popular education in England 
and Wales, and then began with the pittance 
of .20,000 a year ; while as late as 1815 the 
tax on a copy of a newspaper was fourpence. 
The extraordinary changes that have been 
made in these matters, and many more, are 
the work of democracy. "Much space has 
been given to the experience of Great Britain, 
because it is there that the best results of pop- 
ular government have been worked out." The 
other countries that have been deeply touched 
by the democratic spirit are passed in review, 
with an outcome that, on the whole, is encour- 
aging. If the United States has not made as 
much progress in matters of government as 
some other countries which must be admitted 
" one reason is that we began at a point so 
relatively high that a proportionate improve- 
ment was not to be expected, especially when 
it was encumbered during the first half cen- 
tury with the conflict with slavery, and since 
then with the tide of promiscuous foreign em- 
igration." 

Before passing on, we may remark upon the 
almost universal tendency to exaggerate the 
weaknesses and excesses of democracy as com- 
pared with those of aristocracy or monarchy. 
The fact is a distinctly interesting one, and its 
psychology well worth investigation. Somehow 
it is far worse for the people to kill than it is 
for the prince or the lord ; also far worse to 
kill a prince or lord than it is to kill the peo- 
ple. And yet Mr. Froude assures us, in a pow- 
erful paragraph of his " Caesar," that the 
popular party, as compared with the aristo- 
cratic party, has always been the party of mod- 
eration and mercy. 

" Patricians and plebians, aristocrats and democrats, 
have alike stained their hands with blood in the work- 
ing out of the problem of politics. But impartial his- 
tory also declares that the crimes of the popular party 
have in all ages been the lighter in degree, while in 
themselves they have more to excuse them ; and if the 
violent acts of revolutionists have been held up more 
conspicuously for condemnation, it has been only be- 
cause the fate of noblemen and gentlemen has been 
more impressive to the imagination than the fate of the 
peasant or the artisan. But the endurance of the ine- 
qualities of life by the poor is the marvel of human 
society. When the people complain, said Mirabeau, the 
people are always right. The popular cause has been 



the cause of the laborer struggling for a right to live 
and breathe and think as a man. Aristocracies fight 
for wealth and power wealth which they waste upon 
luxury, and power which they abuse for their own 
interests. Yet the cruelties of Marius were as far ex- 
ceeded by the cruelties of Sylla as the insurrection of 
the beggars of Holland was exceeded by the bloody 
tribunal of the Duke of Alva; or as ' the horrors of the 
French Revolution ' were exceeded by the massacre of 
the Huguenots two hundred years before, for which the 
Revolution was the expiatory atonement." 

But while a firm believer in democracy, Mr. 
Bradford contends that in the United States, 
and in some other countries where popular 
government is found, democracy is out of joint. 
Popular government is not producing its legit- 
imate fruits. Incompetence, extravagance, and 
corruption abound and grow apace. He passes 
in review our National, State, and municipal 
governments, as they bear upon this point. 
The suppression of the Southern rebellion and 
the maintenance of the Union, together with 
" the crowning glory," the restoration of peace, 
and the speedy reestablishment of fraternal 
relations between the sections, shows what the 
American democracy is capable of doing when 
it has a fair chance. 

" A firm conviction is justified that the spirit which 
did these things is just as available to-day for the vic- 
tories of peace as it then was for those of war; that it 
can be made use of for reforms which would immedi- 
ately insure the purity and efficiency of government in 
the Nation, the States, and the cities. Why it is not, 
and how it may be so made, it is the object of this book 
to examine." 

What, then, is the matter ? Why does not 
popular government work as it ought to work ? 
Why is it that our governments are inefficient, 
costly, and often corrupt ? The answer comes 
in such propositions as that " The executive is 
the essential branch of government," " Neither 
the people nor the legislature can govern," and 
" Our dangers arise from the legislature." 
Much of the author's argumentation is really, 
but not formally, an expansion of the well- 
known sentences that Madison sent in one of 
the papers of " The Federalist." 

" Experience proves a tendency in our governments 
to throw all power into the legislative vortex. The ex- 
ecutives of the States are little more than ciphers. The 
legislatures are omnipotent. If no effectual check can 
be devised on the encroachments of the latter, a revo- 
lution will be inevitable." 

Such was Mr. Madison's prophecy. If he and 
his compeers could have seen the spectacle of 
mingled incompetence and corruption that our 
worst State legislatures present year after year 
the carnivals of folly and selfishness they 
might have been too disheartened to go farther

THE DIAL,

with the experiment of popular government. 
Fortunately, the character of Congress has 
never fallen so low, although that is low enough ; 
but the municipal legislatures have gone still 
lower. 

Good government, we are told, is impossible 
without leadership, and legislatures cannotlead. 
Political leadership, like all other leadership, 
is necessarily individual, and it must reside in 
or be directly connected with the executive. 

" In all cases in history where a nation has been 
lifted out of almost desperate complications, it has been 
always under the leadership of one man. Take the 
dawn of modern civilization in Europe under Charla- 
magne. There is William the Silent in Holland, William 
Pitt in England, Richelieu and Napoleon in France, 
Stein and Bismarck in Germany, Cavour in Italy, 
Washington and Lincoln in America." 

If it were objected that some of these names 
are of ominous sound to believers in popular 
government, the author would reply that they 
stand for the power and value of leadership, 
which is just as important in popular govern- 
ments as in any other. 

What then is the remedy for the ills of the 
body politic? What must be done to put 
democracy in joint ? In general the answer is 
that the power of the legislatures must be 
limited and the power of the executives be 
increased, while the two are brought into closer 
affiliation. In a word, the answer is the spe- 
cific if the word may be allowed that Mr. 
Bradford has been holding up to view all these 
weary years, a form of cabinet government. 

" For this it is necessary that they [Congress and the 
President] should come physically into contact; that 
the executive should have just as good an opportunity 
of stating his position and defending his rights before 
the great arbitrating tribunal of public opinion as the 
legislature has, and that each branch should enforce 
responsibility upon the other." 

" The prescription for the complaint," Mr. 
Bradford tells us, " is furnished to us by good 
authority," namely, a bill that was submitted 
to the National Senate by an influential com- 
mittee of its members in February, 1881, of 
which the following are the two leading para- 
graphs : 

" That the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the 
Navy, the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney Gen- 
eral, and the Postmaster General shall be entitled to 
occupy seats on the floor of the Senate and House of 
Representatives, with the right to participate in debate 
on matters relating to the business of their respective 
departments under such rules as may be prescribed by 
the Senate and House respectively. 

" That the said Secretaries, the Attorney-General, 
and the Postmaster-General shall attend the sessions of 
the Senate on the opening of the sittings on Monday 



and Thursday of each week to give information asked 
by resolution or in reply to questions which may be 
propounded to them under the rules of the Senate and 
House; and the Senate and House may by standing 
order dispense with the attendance of one or more of 
said officers on either of said days." 

So far as remedy is concerned, Mr. Bradford's 
reasoning in great part may be described as the 
expansion and enforcement of these main ideas. 

We have now outlined, very roughly, the 
general course of the argument. It will not be 
at all new to many readers. These ideas have 
been more or less familiar to the country for a 
generation. Criticism of them, to be of value, 
would necessarily require space that we cannot 
devote to the subject. We have long been of 
the opinion that it is desirable to bring the 
legislative and executive branches of our gov- 
ernments into much closer connection, borrow- 
ing, as far as we fairly can considering out 
institutions, the cabinet idea of England ; but 
we must confess to not being fully persuaded 
that if this were done the effects would be as 
far-reaching and as beneficent as Mr. Bradford, 
in his enthusiastic advocacy, is disposed to 
think. For the rest, it must suffice to say that 
he conducts the discussion with decided ability 
and earnestness ; that he brings before us an 
amount of historical and political information 
that makes his work valuable for the purposes 
of comparative study, and that, even if one does 
not agree with him fully, or not at all, in his 
main theses, he must admit the great import- 
ance of the subject and the value of all discus- 
sions of it that show marks of serious study by 
an earnest and able mind. 

We have a single reflection to add. If salva- 
tion can come to us only in the manner that 
Mr. Bradford believes, the outlook is not very 
encouraging. His main idea has now been for 
some time before the country. We have not 
forgotten although he does not mention it, 
that we have observed a resolution which 
was before the House of Representatives in 
1865, in the identical words, or nearly so, that 
are quoted above from the report of 1881, 
and that nothing came of it but talk. Mr. 
George H. PendletOn, then in the House, was 
the real author of the measure, as he was no 
doubt of the later one. General Garfield, who 
was always deeply interested in whatever prom- 
ised to improve government, then serving his 
first term in the House, supported it in an able 
speech that may be found in the first volume of 
his published works. This was his peroration : 

" I hope, Mr. Speaker, that this measure will be 
fairly considered. If it do not pass now, the day will

[Feb. 16, 



come, I believe, when it will pass. When that day 
comes, I expect to see a higher type of American States- 
manship, not only in the cabinet, but also in the legisla- 
tive hall." 

Unhappily, we see no sign of progress since 
that day, and the realization of the prophecy 
seems as far off as ever. g A. HINSDALE. 



REALISM ix FRENCH HISTORY.* 



" To note the varying forms of government, to trace 
the ancient origin of modern laws and customs, to mark 
the encroachment of absolutism on popular rights, to 
describe the long-continued struggle of the many to 
throw off the yoke of the few, to emphasize the cor- 
rupting influences of the union between Church and 
State, to illustrate once more the blighting effects of 
superstition, ignorance, blind obedience, unjust laws, 
confiscation under the disguise of unequal taxes, and 
the systematic plunder, year by year, of the weaker 
classes by the stronger, have been the motives which 
led to the enormous labor involved in this book." 

Thus forcibly stated is the comprehensive 
proposition of which Mr. Watson's " Story of 
France " is the demonstration. He explicitly 
disclaims any attempt to fill in details in his 
study of the development of a great people, 
and protests that nothing less than a great pur- 
pose would have led him to undertake the pro- 
duction of these two large volumes. This 
purpose, then, is the raison d'etre of the work ; 
it looks out on every page, it is apparent be- 
tween the lines, it colors the facts and makes 
an untrue perspective ; and the question ever 
recurs, Does the end justify the means ? 

If, however, we accept this proposition and 
make allowance for the purpose, we have only 
applause for the consistent attitude and fear- 
less honesty of the author. His aggressive 
truth-telling makes French history superla- 
tively realistic, and his fertile mind, keen wit, 
and dramatic power combine to make a story 
of absorbing interest. He is no technical his- 
torian whose qualifications invariably include 
scholarly research, accuracy, and discriminat- 
ing judgment. He is, rather, the philosopher, 
who, after wide reading and assimilation, has 
been inspired to present in entertaining form 
the historical discoveries of others. In other 
words, Mr. Watson is the popular historian in 
vogue to-day. 

The historian of a half-century ago was the 
man whose work showed care, symmetry, grace 
of style, fluency, and finish. Accuracy was

THE CONSULATE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. By Thomas

necessary, to be sure ; but the manner was of 
greater importance than the matter, and errors 
of characterization, if there were such, were 
uniformly in favor of the personage depicted. 
To-day we seem to see a reaction, and the dan- 
ger of an extreme in the other direction seems 
imminent. If, as has been stated, we had " by 
a slow process of evolution well-nigh discarded 
from the lives of our greatest men of the past 
all human faults and feelings ; have enclosed 
their greatness in glass of the clearest crystal 
and hung up a sign ' Do not touch,' " we are 
on the verge of another extreme wherein a com- 
mendable ambition to " humanize " runs riot 
and renders inhuman. It is apparently true 
that the public has outlived the days of myth- 
ology and is tired of hero-worship. Nothing 
is so relished as the " True Story," wherein 
the traditional bundle of valor and virtue is 
invested with real flesh and blood and painted 
with true, if less vivid, colors. It is a refresh- 
ing performance, and when the task is under- 
taken with sympathy and enthusiasm, and the 
attributes of the writer include fluency and a 
well-balanced use of dramatic effect, he is then 
able to count upon the support of that uncer- 
tain quantity the reading public. 

Mr. Watson has succeeded admirably in 
meeting the demands of this exacting critic. 
The sympathy and enthusiasm are not wanting, 
his creatures are men, not mere historical fig- 
ures, the style is dramatic and the interest sus- 
tained. But having got the ear of the public, 
is it fair to impose upon the credulity of his 
audience ? Is there any justifiable excuse for 
working upon the feelings of the reader with 
the weapons of the emotional evangelist ? Will 
not the effort to paint dark days blacker 
to ignore the rays of light and truth which 
have never been quite obscured react in a 
way to bring discredit upon the narrative? 
If this tendency develops, shall we not ex- 
pect a protest against extravagant realism in 
history ? 

Let us examine, by way of illustration, Mr. 
Watson's portrait of Frederick II. of Prussia. 

" Frederick the Great is one of the ' great men ' of 
history. Like most members of that order, he was 
unscrupulous, ungrateful, cruel, and treacherous. He 
played politics with a callous double-facedness that was 
Machiavellian in its perfect art. He could lie like 
Queen Elizabeth, could be as merciless as Caesar, as 
vindictive as Philip II., and as cynical as Sylla." 

We fail to find a syllable of commendation in 
a score of references to this celebrated monarch. 
It is fierce treatment for a personage of such 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



117 



achievements, by a writer who goes out of his 
way to accord credit to a king so universally 
condemned as Philip II. 

Mr. Watson's cordial condemnation of affairs 
existing under our own flag finds expression in 
an interpolated paragraph on Taxation, which, 
with its prophecy between the lines, we quote. 

" Taxation, after all, is confiscation. When the gov- 
ernment takes no more than its just dues, the evil is a 
necessary one, for the government must live at the 
public expense. . . . More than it needs is tyranny. 
. . . Exceptions are made of those ablest to pay. . . . 
Now let the wrong go one step further. Let the privi- 
leged be salaried, pensioned, and sinecured out of the 
tribute wrung from the unprivileged, and we have a 
government which will become as rotten, as cruel, as 
vicious, and as intolerable as any that ever existed in 
the days of paganism. 

"This was precisely what Bourbon was driving at, 
precisely what Richelieu achieved, precisely what Louis 
XIV. enjoyed, precisely what went to pieces under 
Louis XVI., and precisely what now exists in all Chris- 
tian lands." 

Is this history, or has history simply furnished 
an excuse for a political stump-speech or a text 
for a campaign argument ? That Mr. Watson 
was not unprepared for criticism because of 
these frequent digressions, is apparent ; for he 
discusses the province of the historian, and 
defends his " right to meddle with politics." 

" Is it not, then, the legitimate right of the historian 
to deal with laws as well as battles ? With robberies 
by statute as well as robberies by riot ? Must he write 
of the crimes of the sword and never speak of the crimes 
of the pen ? " 

But whether in sympathy or at variance with 
this purposeful historian, we read on. The force 
and sincerity of the writer are unmistakable, 
and the tale is fascinating. Mr. Watson's first 
essay in history has succeeded, without doubt, 
in stimulating interest in his subject ; and 
herein must lie one of the chief merits of a 
book, where the facts of history are too often 
sacrificed to striking epigram and entertain- 
ment. There are scores of statements in these 
absorbing pages which cannot be corroborated ; 
and more numerous than these are the distor- 
tions of fact, or the failure to give all the 
facts, which make it impossible to designate 
the work as history in an authoritative sense. 
There are so many examples which illustrate 
one or the other of these faults, that it is diffi- 
cult to choose. However, the revolting account 
of life under the Ancien Regime, in the second 
volume, is a conspicuous illustration. Should 
we accept it in its entirety, we must believe in 
the unspeakable degradation of French Royalty 
and nobility universal and without excep- 
tion ; we must count virtue and decency un- 



known except among shopkeepers. Indeed, 
even from a champion of the people, is not the 
argument against classes weakened by whole- 
sale denunciations ? 

Thus we have the partisan, the prophet, the 
reformer. Yet, whatever the role, the promise 
in the preface has been faithfully kept, and 
these two readable volumes bear conspicuous 
evidence of sincerity and ability.

CLASSICAL HISTORY, FESTIVALS, AND 

IjEGENDS.* 

The study of all matters pertaining to the 
Roman Empire has of late years taken on 
something of a new phase. In the place of the 
universal vilification of a generation ago, stu- 
dents of to-day accord to Roman life some- 
thing like a just measure of credit. In the 
same proportion as the study of the first few 
centuries of the Empire has not been carried on 
from the point of view of Christian apologetics, 
have we come to see the extraordinary mod- 
ern quality of the life then lived. Professor 
Thomas, in " Roman Life under the Caesars," 
has given a somewhat general treatment of 
this subject from the new point of view. He 
is well grounded in his literature, and has very 
properly made use of archaeology as furnishing 
materials for reconstructing the life of the time. 
Especially does this appear in his study of the 
Roman home life and the barbarians. The 
subjects handled are somewhat miscellaneous, 
and the student of Friedlander will find few 
things new, but the work makes a capital hand- 
book of its subject. 

Another phase of the present interest in 
classical history is to be seen in the study of 
numismatics, a branch of archaeology that has 
to-day some better use than to amuse amateur 
collectors. The " Handbook of Greek and 
Roman Coins," by Mr. Hill of the British

Museum, is something more than a mere de- 
scription of different coins, and for that reason 
is exactly the work that has been wanted. It 
will be difficult to find a better presentation of 
such matters as the manufacture of the coin, 
and the process of dating coins, than is given 
in this handbook. Occasionally, however, one 
might be inclined to differ with his judgment 
as to the authenticity of issues : as, for example, 
in the case of those issued in the year three of 
Judaea, which have been commonly assigned to 
Simon the Maccabee. Mr. Hill refers this to 
the period of the great revolt under Nero, but 
gives no reason for his decision. The volume 
contains a series of valuable appendices, not the 
least important of which is a select bibliog- 
raphy. In addition it has fifteen collotype 
plates, which are as beautiful representations of 
the coins as one is likely to see. 

Equal commendation can be given the work 
upon Roman Festivals, by W. Warde Fowler. 
The plan of the book is perhaps somewhat 
arbitrary, as it follows the calendar in its de- 
scription of the festivals. This, of course, has 
a certain encyclopaedic advantage, but at the 
same time does not give the assistance which 
comes from a classification of festivals on the 
basis of their intention. In this connection, 
however, it should be stated that the author is 
not as greatly interested as are men like Mr. 
Frazer in the origin and deep-seated intention 
of the festivals, but is more concerned in de- 
scribing the customs as they actually existed. 
Within these limits, the book is most admira- 
bly constructed, and forms an exceedingly val- 
uable addition, not only to our knowledge of 
Roman life, but also to our knowledge of Roman 
religion ; for notwithstanding the praiseworthy 
absence of speculation on the part of the author 
as to the question whether the Roman festivals 
preserved primitive customs, no one can read 
the mass of material brought together so care- 
fully without feeling the force of the claim that 
religious festivals are largely the conventional- 
ized customs of primitive people preserved as 
forms of worship long after their original inten- 
tion has been forgotten. 

It is somewhat startling, however, to find 
this thesis carried out so rigorously by Mr. 
Andrew Lang within the somewhat narrow 
limits of the Homeric Hymns. Mr. Lang is 
very sure that the Hymns are fragments of a 
school which had a great master and great tra- 
ditions. This, of course, is not especially sen- 
sational, but he also seeks " the origins of 
Apollo, and of the renowned Eleusinian Mys- 



teries, in the tales and rites of the Bora and 
the Nanga ; in the beliefs and practices of the 
Pawnees and Larrakeah, Yao, and the Khond." 
This purpose Mr. Lang elaborates in his strik- 
ing conclusion, all of which would well bear 
quotation, but perhaps the following sentences 
most of all : 

"The confusions of sacred and profane; the origins 
of the Mysteries; the beginnings of the Gods in a mental 
condition long left behind by Greece when the Hymns 
were composed; all these matters need elucidation. I 
have tried to elucidate them as results of evolution from 
the remote prehistoric past of Greece, which, as it 
seems, must in many points have been identical with the 
historic present of the lowest contemporary races. In 
the same way, if dealing with ornament, I would derive 
the spirals, volutes, and concentric circles of Mycenaean 
gold-work, from the identical motives, on the oldest 
incised rocks and kists of our Islands, of North and 
South America, and of the tribes of Central Australia, 
recently described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, and 
Mr. Carnegie." 

" Greek religion, Greek myth, are vast conglomerates. 
We find a savage origin for Apollo, and savage origins 
for many of the Mysteries. But the cruelty of savage 
initiations has been purified away. On the other hand, 
we find a barbaric origin for departmental gods, such as 
Aphrodite, and for Greek human sacrifices, unknown to 
the lowest savagery. From savagery Zeus is probably 
derived ; from savagery come the germs of divine 
amours in animal forms. But from barbarism arises 
the sympathetic magic of agriculture, which the lowest 
races do not practise. From the barbaric condition, not 
from savagery, comes Greek hero worship, for the low- 
est races do not worship ancestral spirits." 

It goes without saying that the translation of 
the Hymns is done into excellent English^ 
perhaps just a trifle over-classic. 

It is a far cry from this work of Mr. Lang's 
to mediaeval legends as to Virgil. To most 
readers of Mr. Leland's collection of the " Un- 
published Legends of Virgil," one may suppose, 
it will come as a surprise to know that the 
friend of their school days, like so many wor- 
thies, was transformed by mediaeval popular 
imagination into a sorcerer, generally with hon- 
orable and kindly intentions, and that through- 
out Italy there are still in existence among the 
people stories of his extraordinary perform- 
ances. The probability is that they all spring 
from the Sixth Book of the u^Eneid, and are 
thus humble guarantees of the guide chosen by 
Dante ; but apart from that, is not Virgil the 
last man, unless it be Horace, who would ex- 
pect to find himself made into a mediaeval demi- 
god ? The stories are translated from a large 
number of sources, and form as curious a tail- 
piece to classical study as they are serviceable 
to the student of folk-lore.

PROFESSOR FISKE'S ESSAYS.* 

" A Century of Science " is the slightly 
misleading title, explained by the sub-line " and 
Other Essays," of a little book which will be 
welcomed by many readers. While the Other 
Essays which, in fact, include addresses, 
biographies, and book reviews, as well as essays 
proper form much the larger portion of the 
book, the spirit of a century preeminently sci- 
entific runs through the whole and does much 
to justify the leading title. The initial essay of 
the volume is an excellent presentation of the 
principal results of the scientific work of the 
last hundred years stated in terms of philos- 
ophy. The extension of the knowledge of 
chemical and physical laws over the extra- 
terrestrial sphere, the development of uniform- 
itarianism in geology, of the doctrine of corre- 
lation of forces in physics, of natural selection 
in biology, and of the philosophy of evolution 
in all branches of research, are all well shown 
in proper relations. Where, however, one 
attempts so much in a single essay, mistakes 
of fact or emphasis are hardly to be avoided. 
In the present case, for example, while the 
pre-Darwinian evolutionists have been treated 
to a refreshing meed of justice, the pre-Lyellian 
geologists are more scantily served. Particu- 
larly are the earlier French geologists ignored ; 
and this is the more unexpected since Sir Archi- 
bald Geikie has so recently called fitting atten- 
tion to them. 

The chapters on the " Scope and Purpose 
of Evolution " and on " The Part Played by 
Infancy in the Evolution of Man " belong to- 
gether, and include a discussion of Mr. Spen- 
cer's views, which, in the light of the fund of 
personal anecdote brought in, we must con- 
sider as almost ex-cathedra. In " Guessing at 
Half and Multiplying by Two," a much needed 
dressing-down is given to some would-be critics 
of science. In lighter vein is the essay on 
circle squarers, perpetual - motion inventors, 
and others of similar pursuits who are consid- 
ered under the caption " Some Cranks and 
their Crotchets." 

The remaining miscellaneous essays include 
a discussion of the late lamented " Arbitration 
Treaty," " Cambridge as a Village and City," 
" The Origins of Liberal Thought in Amer- 
ica," " A Harvest of Irish Folk-Lore," and the 
well-known summary of " Forty Years of the 
Bacon-Shakespeare Folly " contributed to the

anniversary number of "The Atlantic Monthly." 
The biographies are four in number. They 
deal with Edward Livingston Youmans, Sir 
Harry Vane, Edward A. Freeman, and Francis 
Parkman. Of these essays, the first is mainly 
a personal tribute. The second and third are 
concise interpretations of the work of the men. 
The fourth is a really notable summary of the 
life and work of a very notable man. Pro- 
fessor Fiske, vigorous fighter that he is, can 
hardly hide himself and his opinions even in 
writing biography, and in speaking of You- 
mans he finds place for a word on the intem- 
perance of the temperance party (p. 76), and 
he turns from Parkman for a side-thrust at 
forty per cent tariffs (p. 223). 

On the whole, the book is a collection of 
exceedingly readable and thoughtful papers 
previously widely scattered.

THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTION.* 



In no part of the industrial sphere has the failure 
of the classical economy to explain the new order of 
affairs, following the widespread use of machinery 
and the consolidation of industries, been so apparent 
as in the field of Distribution. Realizing that this 
failure had its origin in the theory developed by 
the older economists, that the value and prices of 
commodities were determined under conditions, of 
free competition, the later economists, notably the 
Austrian school, have brought forward the marginal- 
utility theory of value, explanatory of monopolized 
as well as competitive industries, of conditions in a 
dynamic as well as in a static society. This theory,

subject to slight modifications by individual writers, 
may be said to have found a permanent place in the 
writings of present-day economists. But the appli- 
cation of this theory to the problems of Distribution 
has proceeded but slowly. Some valuable work in 
this direction has been done, it is true, especially by 
American economists. But the work so done is 
fragmentary, and is so scattered through the maga- 
zines that there is danger that its real value will not 
be recognized. 

It is the work of bringing together this scattered 
material, and of constructing out of it and the work 
of the Austrians a theory of Distribution consonant 
with modern conditions, that Dr. Macfarlane has 
attempted in " Value and Distribution." His work 
is, however, not entirely one of construction, as his 
criticism of other writers and modification of their 
views ultimately leads him to a presentation of a 
theory of his own. This theory of Distribution 
originates in his belief that neither the cost theory 
of Bicardo nor the marginal-utility theory of the 
Austrians serves as a complete explanation of the 
way in which price is determined. The former 
fails because it does not show that in the case of 
monopoly or scarcity of goods the producer obtains 
a surplus over costs ; the latter fails because it does 
not take account of consumers' surplus. The au- 
thor's contention is that the point at which price is 
fixed is more or less indeterminate, being some- 
where between the marginal utility of the good to 
the consumer and its marginal utility to the pro- 
ducer, the exact point depending on the relative 
monopoly strength of buyer and seller. This he 
terms the monopoly theory of price, true of all 
goods which are not freely reproducible. In dis- 
tributing the social product among the various 
factors of production, we may find, the author con- 
tends, three forms of surplus : We have rent, which 
is a differential surplus peculiar to all factors, and 
is due to actual differences in the productivity of 
different portions of land, capital, labor, or em- 
ployers. It does not enter into price, but is deter- 
mined by price. We have also a marginal or 
monopoly surplus, which is secured by all factors in 
case they are engaged in the production of com- 
modities which have a monopoly or scarcity value. 
This is the surplus over the marginal utility to the 
producer mentioned above in treating of price. 
Unlike the surplus rent, this is secured by all pro- 
ducers, those on the margin as well as those above 
it ; and, unlike rent, it does enter into price. The 
author would call this monopoly surplus profits ; 
but it would seem likely to cause confusion to use a 
word of common usage to denominate this unfa- 
miliar conception of monopoly earnings. The third 
form of surplus is the normal surplus secured only 
by the factors that are freely reproducible, capital 
and labor. The normal surplus in the ease of cap- 
ital is interest, in the case of labor it is gain. Both 
result from the fact that the supply of these factors 
is limited by the abstinence of the marginal saver 
or laborer, as the case may be, who sacrifices present 



enjoyment in order to continue producing for the 
future. Like the surplus profits, this normal sur- 
plus enters into price. From this brief statement of 
the theory it will he seen that confusion must inevi- 
tably result from the attempt to keep separate these 
three forms of surplus. Little seems to be gained 
by the effort to treat interest and gain as a surplus. 
The author himself admits that in a progressing 
society they become a part of costs. The writer's 
criticism of recent theories is characterized by much 
acuteness, but the continuity of his own argument 
is broken by the unnecessarily long excursions into 
the history of theory, and by the numerous and 
lengthy quotations with which the pages of his book 
are filled. 

The present system of distribution finds a sharp 
criticism from the extreme socialistic standpoint in 
Rodbertus's " Overproduction and Crises," an ex- 
cellent English translation of which has been made 
by Miss Julia Franklin. Rodbertus's theory of 
crises is, in brief, as follows : In spite of an increas- 
ing productivity of labor, the wages of the laboring 
classes become an ever smaller portion of the na- 
tional product. Because of this fact, "the pur- 
chasing power of four-fifths or five-sixths of society 
does not expand in proportion to the progressive pro- 
duction, but rather simultaneously contracts in like 
proportion, from which it would be just and easy to 
demonstrate the necessity of gluts." If every partici- 
pant in exchange retained the entire product of his 
labor, then no glut could arise from over-production 
of any one or of all commodities until more of them 
had been produced than were required by society. 
The purchasing power of society would then always 
remain commensurate with its productiveness. In 
a critical Introduction to this work, Professor J. B. 
Clark points out that crises do not result either 
from over-production or from a wrong distribution, 
but from misdirected production ; i. ., employers 
have made speculative and inaccurate estimates of 
incomes that are to exist in the future. Even if 
Rodbertus's theory of wages as a steadily declining 
share of product were true, it would not lead to a 
crisis. " Whatever qualities producing employers 
may lack, they have the capacity to bring the kinds 
of goods that from year to year they make into a 
general conformity to any gradually changing de- 
mand." 

" The Psychology of Socialism," by the author 
of " The Psychology of Peoples " and " The Psy- 
chology of the Crowd," is an interesting and sug- 
gestive book. To suggest, however, is not to 
demonstrate ; and, unfortunately, the writer has 
accepted his suggestions as though they were al- 
ready beyond the pale of controversy, and has been 
at little pains to examine the premises on which he 
bases his conclusions or to carefully weigh the evi- 
dence with which he supports them. As a conse- 
quence, many of his statements are without foun- 
dation, and even such of his interpretations of 
phenomena and tendencies as seem reasonable need 
far more proof than has been offered before we can

accept them as final. They suggest an explanation, 
but do not warrant it. Socialism, the author thinks, 
is rapidly gaining converts, and gives promise of a 
speedy adoption by one of the nations of Europe. 
It owes its power, however, not to any inherent 
truthfulness of its theories, nor to the fact that it 
would bring to its adherents the results at which it 
aims. Socialism is essentially a belief, and one 
which is rapidly assuming a religious form. It ap- 
peals to the emotions rather than to the reason, and 
its success, like that of all religious beliefs, is en- 
tirely independent of the proportion of truth which 
it contains. Its present success is due to the fact 
that it has appeared at a period in the world's his- 
tory when men have become skeptical concerning 
the old doctrines and distrustful of the promises 
held out by the old religions. Something must re- 
place the old doctrines, for " humanity has not 
been able to exist without beliefs." Socialism fits 
the needs of the hour. It is not based on logic, 
and it does not equal the old beliefs in the grandeur 
of its ideals ; but it does constitute an ideal which, 
however low, " possesses the merit of bestowing on 
man a hope which the gods no longer give." Ow- 
ing to the fact that it appeals to the imagination 
rather than to reason, socialism appeals to the 
Latin mind much more forcibly than to the people of 
Teutonic origin. M. Le Bon apparently regards it as 
inevitable that at least one among the Latin nations 
of Europe (present circumstances point to Italy) 
should make an experiment with socialism on a 
large scale. No latter-day prophet of Latin degen- 
eracy has been more unsparing in his denunciation 
of the Romanic peoples than is this French psy- 
chologist and sociologist in the several chapters 
which he devotes to this subject. The Latin peo- 
ples, he asserts, are " characterized by feebleness 
of will, energy, and enterprise." Lacking the indi- 
vidual initiative of the Anglo-Saxons, they are con- 
stantly seeking to be guided and governed. Their 
past history, their present needs and lack of capac- 
ity, their system of education which teaches de- 
pendence and the need of external discipline, and 
their failure to modify the old concepts of religion 
without rejecting all belief, have " doomed " the 
Latin nations " to suffer the State socialism which the 
collectivists are preaching to-day." Had M. Le Bon 
confined himself to the work for which he is fitted and 
for which his book professes to stand a psycholog- 
ical analysis of the social mind, with the purpose of 
discovering the grounds for the reception and rapid 
spread of socialistic doctrines his book would 
have been of more worth and would have inspired 
more confidence than it will in its present shape. 
His knowledge of economic phenomena is not pro- 
found, and he lacks the sympathy for the laboring 
classes which is necessary to a fair discussion of the 
social problems of to-day. His fondness for gen- 
eralizations and striking statements has led him into 
statements not only careless and crude, but such 
as are unwarranted by even the most superficial 
knowledge of the facts. Numerous examples might 



be quoted, but one must suffice an account of 
the Chicago strike of 1894. " It ended," says the 
author, " in the strike of all the railway men in 
the United States, and had as its further results the 
burning of the palaces of the Exposition and the 
immense workshops of the Pullman Company. 
The Government assumed the upper hand only by 
suspending civil rights, proclaiming martial law, 
and delivering veritable battle to the insurgents. 
The strikers were shot down without pity, and de- 
feated." 

" The Profit of the Many " is a strong appeal 
from a Christian socialist for unselfishness in the 
production, distribution, and use of wealth. The 
appeal is made on economic as well as on ethical 
grounds. Self-interest, says the author, is inade- 
quate as a motive to secure the largest production 
of wealth. Production will not attain its true pos- 
sibilities until every producer takes as his motto, 
" I seek not mine own profit but the profit of the 
many." The greater part of the book is taken up 
with a review and analysis of the social teachings 
of the Bible, wherein the author finds support for 
his thesis. Much of this work is well done. The 
treatment of the Mosaic code is especially suggest- 
ive. There is always the danger, however, that 
students of modern social problems who use the 
Bible to illustrate social teachings will read into 
the Scriptures lessons which they were never in- 
tended to convey. This, our author seems at times 
to have done, as when he tries to teach the necessity 
of cooperation from the story of Cain ; equality of 
wealth from the account of the gathering of the 
manna ; and sees in Christ's statement, " Seek first 
the kingdom," not its obvious meaning, seek right- 
eousness, but a command to adopt socialism. No 
one can for a moment doubt the beauty of the ideal 
contained in the principle, " Seek the profit of the 
many," or can wish to withstand the effort to realize 
this ideal. But the author is wiser than his doc- 
trine when he says that " only the universal preva- 
lence of such a spirit can make socialism practicable ; 
and with such a spirit, individualism would accom- 
plish all the ends of socialism." The fact that 
Christ addressed himself to the individual in pre- 
senting the claims of a Christian life, and did not 
seek to overthrow existing social institutions, shows 
that society does not, because it cannot, enforce this 
ideal. The beauty of the principle lies in the very 
fact that it is to be voluntarily and cheerfully ac- 
cepted, not enforced. 

A timely and excellent monograph on an inter- 
esting subject is that of Dr. Fred S. Hall, entitled 
" Sympathetic Strikes and Sympathetic Lockouts." 
Dr. Hall defines a sympathetic strike as one in 
which " workmen having no grievance of their own 
take action out of a belief that another body of 
workmen is not fairly treated, and so take up the 
cause." A sympathetic lockout, on the other hand, 
" occurs when an employer discharges men against 
whom he has no grievance in order thus to enforce 
the settlement of some other dispute." The author 



122 



THE DIAL, 



[Feb. 16, 



reviews briefly the efforts of statisticians and others 
to give precise meaning to the terms " strike " and 
" lockout," and decides that no absolute line of dif- 
ference can be drawn. What the employer calls a 
strike, the laborer terms a lockout. Each party to 
the controversy tries to throw the responsibility for 
initiating the disagreement on to the other's shoul- 
ders. Our author concludes, therefore, that the 
attempt at distinction is both valueless and mis- 
chievous, and in scientific classifications should be 
dropped. But with what seems a strange inconsist- 
ency, the writer immediately insists that there is a 
clear distinction between a sympathetic strike and 
a sympathetic lockout. It would be interesting to 
know how he would make use of this distinction in 
a statistical table in which the distinction between 
strikes and lockouts had been abandoned. Is a 
sympathetic lockout a lockout and not a strike ? If 
so, what shall be done with lockouts that are not 
sympathetic? If the o.nswer be that there are no 
such lockouts, may we not ask why then the quali- 
fying adjective " sympathetic " ? The sympathetic 
strike is a comparatively recent invention, intended 
to further the purpose of the original strike. Its de- 
velopment does not indicate a growth of sympathy 
among the working classes, but a better knowledge 
of their common interests. The sympathetic lockout 
was of much earlier development. It was intended 
to prevent laborers from contributing to the support 
of fellow-laborers during a strike. The necessity for 
it is thus as old as the habit of contributions, and 
this is as old as unionism itself. The sympathetic 
strike is a powerful weapon, but it is like a two-edged 
sword.: it cuts both ways, and requires intelligence for 
its effective use. The most powerful labor organi- 
zations do not make use of it. It has caused the 
downfall of the Knights of Labor and the American 
Railway Union. It cuts off financial assistance to 
the original strikers by a cessation of earnings of 
the sympathizers, and this financial assistance is of 
supreme importance. Dr. Hall, accordingly, does 
not believe that the future holds much in store for 
the sympathetic strike, and thinks that it is likely 
to be displaced by the " successive strike." The 
sympathetic lockout is even less likely to succeed. 
Prices rise, and competing firms who may have 
reached an agreement to assist each other find the 
temptation constantly growing stronger to break 
the agreement, either secretly or openly, in order 
to reap the advantage of high prices. The weakness 
of the sympathetic lockout thus constitutes a con- 
tinual and automatic check to its application. 

Another excellent monograph in the same series 
as the foregoing is that on the " History and Func- 
tions of Central Labor Unions," by Dr. William 
Maxwell Burke. By Central labor unions is meant 
the general union which is caused by the federation 
of the trade unions of a given locality, usually a 
city, for the purpose of rendering mutual assistance 
as in case of strikes, or of cooperating to secure a 
desired end. The unions that make up the Central 
union are not necessarily, or even generally, unions 



of allied trades. In this respect the Central union 
differs from a national trade union, which is nearly 
always a federation of allied trade unions. The 
objects of the Central union are (1) to aid and 
strengthen the organization of the local unions ; 
(2 ) to educate the laborers and the public " along 
those lines in which they hope to accomplish ame- 
lioration in the conditions of labor or to effect cer- 
tain reforms "; and (3) to protect the rights and 
to defend the interests of the laboring classes by 
offensive and defensive alliances of the workers of 
the district or municipality, especially those in the 
local unions. Although Central labor unions were 
not unknown in earlier years, the period of rapid 
development of this form of organization in this 
country has been since 1880. Within this period 
they have grown both in numbers and in influence, 
and have done much to accomplish the above ob- 
jects, especially that of organization. In furthering 
the great object of all trade union organizations 
that of collective bargaining the Central labor 
union has indirectly been of great assistance, espe- 
cially where, as in Cleveland, the union has a sal- 
aried agent to transact the business. The chief 
defect is the looseness of the organization, and the 
fact that the local unions cannot be made to accept 
the decisions of the Central. Unless a radical 
change should take place in the organization of the 
Central unions, Dr. Burke does not think that they 
will be able to directly undertake the function of 
collective bargaining. 

Plans for a reform of the existing wage system 
may be separated into three main classes. The 
first class is composed of those in which the em- 
ployer takes the initiative and which are carried 
out under his supervision. In the second class, the 
laborers combine into organizations, such as trade- 
unions, with the view of obtaining better terms from 
employers. In the third class, the State takes the 
initiative and seeks to effect reforms through leg- 
islation. Such legislative measures range all the 
way from factory laws to the complete suppression 
of the wage system through socialism. It is prob- 
able that most economists and students of the labor 
question to-day expect the ultimate solution of 
the problem to be reached through one of the two 
last-named methods. But only the most rabid advo- 
cates of trade unionism or of socialism would deny 
the possibility of making substantial contributions 
toward the end of industrial peace through the first 
method proposed. It is further to be remembered 
that, as Mr. Gilman, in his work entitled " A Div- 
idend to Labor," says, while " the distant future of 
industry may belong to cooperative production, or 
even to the socialistic stage, the present and the 
near future belong very plainly to capitalistic pro- 
duction on a large scale." In this system the 
employer-manager is an essential part, and his re- 
sponsibilities to his employees and his power of 
establishing friendly relations between capital and 
labor are not slight. Many employers have shown 
their interest in and sympathy for their workmen by 



1900.]

the adoption of profit-sharing, or by what Mr. 
Gilman calls " an indirect dividend to labor " the 
establishment of certain institutions designed to 
promote the welfare of their employees as a class. 
Some of these institutions, which include social 
clubs, hospitals, dispensaries, schools and libraries, 
restaurants and lodging houses, cooperative savings- 
banks, accident and old-age insurance, etc., have 
frequently been described in newspapers and mag- 
azines, but Mr. Gilman has rendered an important 
service by bringing together in one work the infor- 
mation concerning these institutions and the firms 
which have founded them. Not all the establish- 
ments maintaining these welfare institutions have 
been considered, but the most important ones in 
Germany, France, England, and the United States 
are described, and several chapters are devoted to a 
discussion of the principles on which such institu- 
tions should be founded and maintained. One point 
mentioned by the author needs to be noted, and that 
is the danger of paternalism in the management of 
such institutions. Especially in America is it de- 
sirable to leave to the workmen the chief part in 
the administration of such institutions. Many phil- 
anthropic measures have been wrecked through a 
dictatorial policy or a patronizing spirit on the part 
of the employer. In the concluding chapters of the 
book, Mr. Gilman supplements his earlier work 
by some additional information concerning profit- 
sharing. 

The reader of economic literature who can afford 
to devote some time to the consideration of panaceas 
for social disorders will find entertainment, if not 
instruction, in the perusal of Mr. Alfred J. Ferris's 
book entitled " Pauperizing the Rich." Like most 
social reformers, Mr. Ferris finds the cause of pov- 
erty and distress to be the inequality in the distri- 
bution of wealth ; but, unlike many reformers, he 
does not propose, in order to bring about a better 
distribution, to reconstruct the present system of 
production or to abolish in its entirety the competi- 
tive system of distribution. The enormous produc- 
tion of wealth which has characterized the nineteenth 
century the author attributes to the great discov- 
eries and inventions and the improvements in the 
processes of industry which have been made since 
1770. These inventions have usually been patented 
by their inventors, and royalties charged for their 
use under governmental protection for a series of 
years, at the end of which period they have been 
thrown open to the public. It is the latter part of 
this plan to which Mr. Ferris objects. He admits 
that at the expiration of the patent period the ben- 
efit of the invention goes to the consumer ; but he 
is not satisfied with this. He apparently regards 
the consumer as, in some sort, an enemy of society, 
and thinks that in reaping the benefits of improved 
production the consumer is receiving an advantage 
which he has not earned. He would have the na- 
tional government assume the ownership of these 
expired patents, copyrights, etc., in perpetuity and 
would furthermore have the government assume 



control over all improvements that have been made 
in industry since 1770. The government should 
collect the royalties on the same principle that would 
be followed by an individual, and should then divide 
the proceeds equally among the people of the coun- 
try. The effect would be, he thinks, to raise prices 
about one hundred per cent ; but each person would 
receive as his share of the " Property in Ideas " an 
income, estimated by our author at one hundred and 
sixty dollars. " Rated in purchasing power, as 
compared with the present, therefore, each man's 
income would be equal to one half of his present 
income plus one-half of the average income." This 
plan, he thinks, by guaranteeing everyone some sort 
of a living, would abolish poverty, do away with 
much of the present social inequality, abate sinful 
extravagance and remove the temptation to display, 
prevent crises, raise wages and guarantee employ- 
ment to labor, prevent friction between employer 
and employed, check intemperance, gambling, and 
the social evil. It would even do much toward 
reforming the criminal and curing the defective 
classes. There is always some danger of doing 
injustice to a writer by thus epitomizing his theories, 
and, of course, we have not attempted to describe 
the ways in which Mr. Ferris's plan is to bring 
about these desired results. Still, we think that 
this brief statement of method and results exag- 
gerates in no way the absurdity of the book. It is use- 
less to criticize the theory, or to try to show what 
effects such a measure proposed would have on the 
social and economic habits of the people. Mr. Ferris 
is not unaware of the objections which would be 
raised to his measure, but he puts them lightly 
aside as mere trifles the obstacles certain to be 
thrown in the path of any reformer. A careful 
study of the principles of taxation and an investiga- 
tion as to the results of our pifesent pension system 
would richly reward him. 

The State influences distribution in many ways 
that do not savor in the least of Socialism. Per- 
haps the most important of these ways is through 
its taxing power. How it may use this power to 
enrich individuals at the same time that it dimin- 
ishes the resources of others, is well shown by Dr. 
Urdahl's monograph on " The Fee System of the 
United States." This is a carefully-prepared work 
whose value is accentuated by the fact that this 
subject has hitherto received scant attention in the 
American treatises on public finance. The scope of 
the monograph is somewhat wider than its title 
implies, since it treats not only of the fee system in 
this country but gives an historical review of the 
fee systems of Europe, both ancient and modern, 
and has a chapter on the theory of fees in general. 
The author quite rightly defends fees on the prin- 
ciple of benefits or service performed by the State, 
thus distinguishing them from taxes which are levied 
in proportion to the ability of the tax-payer. He 
follows Neumann, Seligman, and Rosewater, in 
separating fees from special assessments ; a distinc- 
tion which, in the opinion of this reviewer, none of 



124 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



these writers has succeeded in justifying. Special 
assessments seem to be only an important class of 
fees. Among the most important abuses which the 
author finds connected with the fee system to-day is 
its employment in police and other minor courts as 
a means of payment of judicial officers and others. 
The tramp problem is aggravated by the encourage- 
ment which the fees give to the judges and jailers 
to confine these men in the jails, and direct encour- 
agement is often given to tramps to return. So 
with petty criminals. Payments according to the 
number of arrests or commitments swell the num- 
ber of persons convicted in the police courts. This 
is shown whenever a change is made from fee pay- 
ments to salaried court officials. The existence of 
court money paid to the wife who has made appli- 
cation for a divorce in order that she may hire an 
attorney, the author thinks, encourages divorce 
proceedings. Finally, the existence of offices which 
yield to their holders immense sums in fees is a 
standing premium to political corruption. The 
replacement of fee-paid public officers by salaried 
officials would do much to remove the political 
corruption connected with purely administrative 
offices. 

Miss Helen Marot has compiled a bibliography 
of writings on the labor problem which will be of 
assistance to the readers of the literature on that 
subject. The execution of the work, however, is 
not entirely satisfactory. The titles of books are 
not always correctly given. The periodical litera- 
ture is not included, on the ground that it is to be 
found in " Poole's Index " and the " Review of 
Reviews," while the compiler has included a mass 
of literature which, like " Monopolies " and the 
" Land Question," have no reference to the labor 
problem. The classification is peculiar in some 
respects, and we fine'Vsuch headings as " Utopias " 
and " How the Other Half Lives." One of the best 
features of the book is the list of the labor period- 
icals and labor songs. It would have been interest- 
ing to have included a list of the important works 
of fiction and the poems dealing with labor questions.

England in England, in the day of her military 

the day saj her decadence and humiliation, may de- 
tupremacy. r j ye & me i ancno iy satisfaction from 

the contemplation of the deeds by land and sea of 
the sturdier sons of her heroic past. In his " How 
England Saved Europe" (Scribner), Dr. W. H. 
Fitchett undertakes to tell, in two moderate-sized 
volumes written from the British point of view, the 
story of the long struggle against Bonaparte (1793- 
1815). Dr. Fitchett's picturesque and animated 
style, and his unfailing sense of the logical and 
dramatic unity of events, make his book an unus- 



ually entertaining and impressive piece of military 
history. He regards the Napoleonic war as essen- 
tially a contest in which, through the instrumental- 
ity of England, the modern world was delivered 
from the thrall of a despotism of the later Roman 
type ; and in his opening chapter he forestalls the 
catastrophe of the great drama he is about to unfold, 
by showing us the fallen Caesar, a volubly complain- 
ing prisoner in the cabin of the " Bellerophon," sunk 
so low as to crave the favor of British citizenship 
from his captors. " Who," exclaims the author, 
" shall assess the value of these memories to the 
new and vaster England of to-day ? " The value 
of these memories has, we are inclined to think, 
been in some regards doubtful. Have they not 
contributed to breed in Englishmen that arrogance 
that has caused the world to-day to jeer at them in 
their hour of humiliation, that blind self-confidence 
that has resulted in the rout of their gorgeous Bond 
Street generals by the unkempt farmer- strategists 
of the Transvaal ? Perhaps, instead of persistently 
pluming herself on the " splendid memories " of 
the Nile and Waterloo, it would be better for En- 
gland to reflect that it is for what she is to-day, not 
for what she was a hundred years ago, that the world 
is going to rate her. What her army is to-day is 
manifest ; if it cannot stand before the Boers what 
showing could it make in a contest with a first-class 
power? Her navy, in respect of ships and arma- 
ment, is powerful ; but what, at present, must be 
the natural inference as to its personnel ? There 
is great reason to fear that that natural inference 
will govern the political enterprises of her rivals 
in a momentous way at no distant date. But 
nevertheless, as we have already said, Englishmen 
may derive a melancholy satisfaction from the con- 
templation of the deeds of their forefathers ; and 
they should find Dr. Fitchett's book much to their 
liking. He has not attempted to deal with En- 
gland's political history during the period covered, 
nor are the continental wars of Napoleon touched 
upon, save incidentally. What is undertaken is " a 
living and realistic account of the greatest war En- 
gland ever waged." The opening volume is mainly 
a record of naval actions, with, incidentally, an ac- 
count of the surprisingly disaffected and even mu- 
tinous spirit prevalent in the navy at this period of 
great warlike achievements. Dr. Fitchett is an 
effective painter of sea-fights. His style is one that 
wakes and feeds the imagination, and his forth- 
coming and concluding volume will be awaited with 
widespread interest. The work is attractively 
printed, and liberally supplied with portraits, plans, 
etc. 



Mr. Ooldwin 
Smith's lalett 
history. 



In the preface to his new two-volume 
work entitled " The United King- 
dom " (Macmillan), Mr. Goldwin 
Smith writes : " The friends who urged the writer 
to undertake this task know that it has been per- 
formed by the hand of extreme old age." If by 
this the author intends to disarm criticism or to

apologize for fancied shortcomings in the present 
labor, he has no occasion for it. As in his earlier 
writings, one finds in " The United Kingdom " the 
same clearness of insight and just appreciation of 
men and events, the same facility of expression, the 
same methodic grace, and, above all, the same mas- 
terly ability in so arranging and classifying material 
as to leave an ineffaceable impression of each historic 
period. The work is, in fact, more free from the 
faults and more replete with the beauties of the 
author's accustomed style than is usual to the labors 
of old age. If it was ever true, as a reviewer said 
of him a few years ago, that " with age he seems 
to have grown fond of crossing the ideas of all 
other men on all subjects and of arguing the worst 
result from any given present condition of affairs," 
the tendency has not developed, and old age has 
mellowed rather than heightened the historian's ag- 
gressiveness. The reverse of this is rather a most 
noticeable characteristic. Mr. Smith was once prone 
to berate the Irish race, to deny their fitness under 
any conditions for self-government, to prophesy 
naught but evil of all projects for political inde- 
pendence, and to insist upon the necessity for strong 
coercive measures if Ireland and England were to 
live in harmony. But in turning from the role of 
pamphleteer to that of historian, the just historical 
attitude has been adopted, and differences of location, 
race, and religion, together with certain unfortunate 
incidents in the history of the two peoples, are made 
responsible for the failure of peaceful union between 
England and Ireland. No word is spoken of the 
future ; for prophecy, the author insists, is not the 
work of the historian. To be sure, Mr. Smith does 
not renounce previous views ; but greater deference 
to contrary beliefs, as well as greater kindliness in 
general, characterize his statements. Again one is 
reminded of an earlier work in which Mr. Smith 
held up the empire to ridicule as a discordant whole, 
emphasizing its lack of unity and expounding upon 
the bitter hostility shown by the races subject to 
Great Britain. Even Canada was depicted as per- 
meated with factional strife and little likely to be 
a source of strength to the mother country in time 
of danger. Mr. Smith's " Empire " of to-day is a 
marvellous achievement, and its organizers are 
men of genius. Due credit is accorded British phil- 
anthropy for its treatment of subject states, and 
England's services as a world-civilizing force are 
justly estimated. Yet the shadows are there also, 
and are portrayed with a keen but friendly criti- 
cism. Mr. Smith has, in a word, abandoned the 
argumentative method in writing this history, and 
chosen to become the scholarly critic of historic 
events. He no longer belittles or magnifies some 
fact in support of his premises ; and as historical 
accuracy combined with brilliant execution are of 
more permanent value than mere brilliance in po- 
lemics, it is certain that the present volumes will 
bring more lasting fame to their author than any 
of his earlier writings. The work practically closes 
with the year 1840. 



As a record of stirring adventure, 
i * k Sir Stephen St. John's "Rajah 

Brooke " (Longmans) is delightfully 
entertaining, while as an account of pioneer en- 
deavor in private enterprise among Eastern peoples, 
it depicts in a clear light conditions of government 
and custom hard to realize by the Western world. 
After a brief career in India, Sir James Brooke, upon 
falling heir to a small fortune, determined in 183$ 
to fit out a ship for the exploration of the then un- 
known peoples of the islands of the eastern Pacific. 
The expedition ended in a remarkable manner, for 
Brooke in the course of a year or so found him- 
self ruler, under the title of Rajah, of a small ter- 
ritory called Sarawak, on the northwest coast of 
Borneo. His title was earned by judicious services 
rendered to the native Sultan, while the allegiance of 
his subjects, Malay, Dyak, and Chinese, was secured 
by the unfailing courage and ability with which he 
defended them against numerous pirate tribes. His 
kingdom of Sarawak, now largely increased in ter- 
ritory and population, still exists under the rule of 
his nephew, Sir Charles Brooke, and furnishes the 
unique spectacle of an Eastern state ruled by an 
Englishman. In a strict sense Brooke was not a 
" Builder of Greater Britain," for his kingdom has 
never passed under the dominion of England, 
though at one time a " protectorate " was immi- 
nent ; but as an example of that adventurous spirit 
which has played so important a part in the exten- 
sion of England's empire, Brooke's name is illus- 
trious. The very fact that his enterprise was indi- 
vidual rather than the result of governmental 
action lends an added interest to the story of his 
successes. The story itself is well told, and with 
an intimate familiarity with the events related, for 
the author was himself an official of the Sarawak 
government in its earlier history, and always a per- 
sonal friend of Brooke. Possibly this friendship 
blinds him to some of the shortcomings of his hero, 
as in the case of the heated controversy with Cob- 
den and Bright, but in general the treatment, while 
sympathetic, is eminently fair. The main interest 
of the work is, however, in the narrative of Brooke's 
achievements. The concluding chapters furnish an 
account of Sarawak, and of British North Borneo, 
at the present day. 

An historical ^ contribution of more than ordinary 
Encyclopedia interest to the annals of American 
oflihnoM. commonwealths is the " Historical 

Encyclopaedia of Illinois " (The Munsell Publishing 
Co., Chicago), edited by Messrs. Newton Bateman 
and Paul Selby, themselves a part of the things they 
set forth. The death of Dr. Bateman, during the 
early stages of the work, left the lion's share of it 
to be performed by Mr. Selby, a veteran journalist 
and citizen of Illinois, and familiar with its leading 
events and men for more than half a century. In 
one aspect the work is a biographical dictionary 
containing the names of 1200 persons whose lives 
are largely identified with that of the state ; in an-

other, it is a gazetteer, the counties of the state and 
all settlements with more than five hundred inhab- 
itants being treated ; in a third, and most important, 
it contains historical material of value to all students 
of human affairs, whether in the history of legisla- 
tion, the growth of institutions, the part borne by 
the people in the various wars of the nation, the 
economical development of railroads and canals, the 
geological and other scientific characteristics of the 
state, or in the ideas for which Illinois is known to 
stand in legislation and political precedent. Espe- 
cially to be noted is the extended essay on the 
" Underground Railroads " which carried so many 
thousands of slaves from the neighboring states of 
Kentucky and Missouri to safety across the great 
lakes into Canada. " Remarkable Inundations," 
" Natural Scenery," " Northern Boundary Ques- 
tion," " Camp Douglas Conspiracy," and " Naviga- 
ble Streams " are all interesting and important 
entries. Where there is so much to commend there 
are, almost of necessity, some omissions to be noticed. 
While the investigator can find " Minority Legisla- 
tion," " Australian Ballot," and " Torrens Land 
Law," he looks in vain for " Factories Act," "Arbi- 
tration Board," " Prison Reform," " Union Labor," 
" Strikes and Lockouts " (other than those in 1877 
and 1894), " Great Trials " (as of the so-called 
anarchists and the murderers of Dr. Cronin), and 
many other matters of the first importance, as it 
would seem ; the treatment of others, as " Labor 
Troubles," being wholly insufficient. It may be 
said generally of the political aspect of the book 
that it is unsympathetic so far as the democratic 
party is concerned, even to a total omission from 
its pages of all mention of the democratic plan of 
nominating United States Senators in State conven- 
tions, a matter held in favor by thoughtful persons 
everywhere ; while the almost infinite obligations of 
the people of Illinois to its one democratic governor 
for placing it among the most progressive of English- 
speaking commonwealths in respect of scientific leg- 
islation find neither expression in the book nor justi- 
fication from its contents. With these limitations, 
the work is deserving of much praise, and has an 
historical value beyond that of any work in its field. 

The trump of America's naval fame 
is blown with no faltering or uncer- 
tain sound in Mr. Edgar Stanton 
Maclay's " History of American Privateers " ( Ap- 
pleton). The volume is published in uniform style 
with the author's valuable " History of the United 
States Navy," now the standard text-book on the 
subject, to which it forms a needed supplement. 
The story of American privateering is a stirring 
and romantic one, and Mr. Maclay tells it with due 
verve and patriotic fire without, however, allow- 
ing his patriotism to sink into mere buncombe. 
The book denotes a considerable degree of inde- 
pendent research, and that its theme is by no means 
relatively unimportant is sufficiently shown by the 
fact that the value of prizes and cargoes taken by

privateers in the Revolution was three times that 
of the prizes and cargoes taken by regular naval 
vessels, while in the War of 1812 we had 517 pri- 
vateers and only 23 vessels in the navy. It was 
undoubtedly mainly the losses inflicted by our 
ships on Great Britain's commerce at sea that con- 
tributed most to bringing our wars with England 
to a close favorable to us. Mr. Maclay points out 
that in all the memorials presented to Parliament 
the arguments used to bring about peace with Amer- 
ica were based on the ruinous destruction of British 
commerce, the increased rates of insurance, the 
diversion of cargoes to foreign bottoms, etc., due to 
the sleepless activity of our privateers. It is to be 
remembered, too, that these vessels fitted out by 
private enterprise were the training school, to a great 
extent, of our navy. Most of the naval heroes of that 
day such men as Truxton, Porter, Biddle,Barney, 
Decatur, Perry, Rodgers, Hopkins served their 
fighting apprenticeship as privateersmen. Mr. Mac- 
lay's spirited and sufficiently thorough book fills a gap 
in American naval history, and should find a place 
on the student's shelves beside its popular prede- 
cessor. The plans and illustrations are satisfactory. 

Life without ^ n a ^ human likelihood, the incre- 

ennut among dulity with which " The Adventures 

Australians. Q f Lou j g de R ougemO nt, as Told by 

Himself" (Lippincott) have been generally received, 
is due to nothing so much as the straining of the 
autobiographer to prove his case. When every- 
thing that can bear out the adventurer's account 
of his stay for half a lifetime in the Australian 
wilds is printed in italics and small capitals, the 
reader's mind goes back to Pooh-Bah's " merely 
corroborative detail, intended to give artistic veri- 
similitude to a bald and unconvincing narrative." 
Mr. William G. Fitz-Gerald writes a preface for 
the book, in which he says : "There are many men 
in England who know Australia. Most of these 
wanted to get at de Rougemont in order to over- 
whelm him ; many had the opportunity, and were 
soon converted into devoted adherents." The name 
of a single authority of all these would have been 
better than the typographical hysterics ; or, failing 
this, Mr. Fitz-Gerald's mere statement. For the 
adventures, wonderful as they are, and wholly out 
of the beaten track of exploration and adventure, 
are still in no degree improbable, if the difference 
in point of view between the Frenchman and the 
ordinary Englishman are taken into account. M. 
de Rougemont is somewhat more effusive on paper 
than most persons speaking English would be ; but 
it can hardly be said that he regards his own per- 
formances more highly than Mr. Theodore Roose- 
velt and several of the newspaper correspondents 
regarded theirs during the war with Spain, as ap- 
pears from their published writings. Without ref- 
erence to the question of veracity, it is safe to say 
that life among the Australian natives as here de- 
scribed, if not wholly desirable, is yet fairly free 
from ennui.

in an evening (as it probably will be, when once 
begun, as we gladly testify) ; and as Benvenuto 
sustained his own life with his chisel, took the lives 
of several others with his poignard, and provided 
entertainment for future lives with his pen, its 
author has entitled it " Chisel, Pen, and Poignard " 
(Longmans). The authorities seem to have been 
carefully examined and collated ; and the book may 
be read to advantage as a preparative for Benve- 
auto's romantic but indispensable chef-d'oeuvre. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The collection of "Songs of All Lands" (American 
Book Co.), which Mr. W. S. B. Mathews has edited 
for school and home use, is a work that meets with our 
most cordial approval. It includes the national songs 
-or hymns of many nations, an interesting selection of 
folk-melodies, a number of worthy old-time favorites 
that we fear the younger generation is in danger of not 
learning, and a few part-songs and glees. The selec- 
tion is altogether admirable, and the reconstruction 
of some of the newer material by Mrs. Jessie L. Gay- 
nor is a feature that deserves special mention. Most 
of the selections are arranged in plain four-part har- 
mony, and in a few cases piano-forte accompaniment is 
provided. 

The two " Columbia University Studies in Litera- 
ture " (Macmillan) that have just been published carry

Mr. Spingarn's monograph on the literary criticism of 
the Renaissance. Both are doctoral dissertations, and 
one of them, Mr. F. W. Chandler's "Romances of 
Roguery," is but half completed, for the volume on 
" The Picaresque Novel in Spain," now at hand, is to 
be followed by a second volume exhibiting the Euro- 
pean influence of that literary form. Our other mon- 
ograph is Mr. John G. Underbill's "Spanish Liter- 
ature in the England of the Tudors." Both works 
are so well done that we may most heartily congratu- 
late Professor Woodberry upon his department of 
the University, since that is the source of this scholarly 
series. 

The "Journal " of the National Educational Associa- 
tion for the Los Angeles Meeting of 1899 has just been 
issued from the University of Chicago Press. It is a 
volume of 1258 pages, and its contents make it a ver- 
itable encyclopaedia of current educational discussion. 
The noticeable features are the three special reports of 
the committees on public libraries, normal schools, and 
college-entrance requirements. These should be read 
by every teacher, for they are among the fundamental 
documents of the modern educational movement. From 
the hundreds of lesser contributions to the volume, it 
would be invidious to select for special mention. It 
must suffice to say that no department is neglected, 
and that much matter of weight is to be found among 
these minor features of the work.

ing been severed. 

The first number of the new " Magazine of Poetry," 
to be issued in March by Mr. Daniel Mallett of New 
York City, will bear an attractive cover-design by Mr. 
Louis J. Rhead, the well-known poster artist. 

A collection of the stories contributed by Mrs. Kate 
Upson Clark to various American magazines is an- 
nounced for Spring publication by Messrs. J. F. Taylor 
& Co., under the title " White Butterflies." 

"Plant Structures" (Appleton) is a second book of 
botany by Professor John M. Coulter, and thus a sequel 
to the author's earlier " Plant Relations." Both are of 
the series of " Twentieth Century Text-Books." 

The Messrs. Scribner publish a uniform library edi- 
tion, in eighteen volumes, of " The Novels and Stories of 
Frank R. Stockton." Six volumes are now ready, and 
we presume the others will follow in due time. The 
books are handsomeiy printed, and the set will be wel- 
comed by all lovers of this genial author. 

" Nature's Miracles " is a volume of short papers on 
popular science by Dr. Elisha Gray. It is the first of a 
series by the same hand, and has for its special subject 
" World- Building and Life." Messrs. Fords, Howard, 
& Hulbert are the publishers. 

Jowett's translation of Thucydides, in a second edi- 
tion, as revised by Messrs. W. H. Forbes and Evelyn 
Abbott, has just been published in two volumes by the 
Oxford Clarendon Press. The notes of the original 
edition are, however, not reprinted. 

A " Florilegium Latinum " (Lane), edited by Messrs. 
Francis St. John Thackeray and Edward Daniel Stone, 
has just been published as a " Bodley Anthology." The 
translations into Latin are by many hands, and from 
Greek, English, and Continental poets. 

The Smithsonian Report for 1897, issued from the 
Government Printing Office, is a thick volume of more 
than a thousand pages, and something like the same 
number of illustrations. The latter includes a fine 
series of eighty full-page plates, illustrative of recent 
Foraminifera, as described in a monograph by Mr. 
James M. Flint. The remaining monographs include 
two of unusual length: " Pipes and Smoking Customs

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 



of the American Aborigines," by Mr. J. D. McGuire; 
and " Arrowpoints, Spearheads, and Knives of Prehis- 
toric Times," by Mr. Thomas Wilson. 

Volume X. of the " Harvard Studies in Classical 
Philology," published by Messrs. Ginn & Co., contains 
eleven papers, mostly concerned with the minuter mat- 
ters of scholarship, although one or two of them offer 
an exception to this general characterization. 

" The Russian Journal of Financial Statistics " for 
1900 is an octavo volume of over two hundred pages, 
written in excellent English, and likely to be of great 
value for reference purposes by economists and stndeuts 
of finance. It is an official publication of the Russian 
government prepared for free distribution to librarians, 
editors, and others interested in the subject. 

The edition of White's " Natural History of Sel- 
borne," which Mr. John Lane has just published, is 
everything that the most exacting demand could specify. 
It is a handsome royal octavo of more than five hun- 
dred pages, with hundreds of illustrations. The late 
Grant Allen edited this sumptuous volume shortly be- 
fore his death, and a more competent editor and anno- 
tator could not have been found. 

" The Jew and Other Stories," by Ivan Tourgue'nieff, 
forms the fifteenth, and, we understand, the final vol- 
ume in Mrs. Garuett's admirable translation of the great 
novelist. For the first time we have practically the 
whole of Tourgue'nieff's fiction in a uniform set of vol- 
umes, and the recent prize award of the " Academy " to 
Mrs. Garnett was a richly-deserved recognition of the 
meritorious character of her work. The Macmillan Co. 
publish this edition.

TO HISTORICAL STUDENTS: 

A reputable and responsible publishing house has in hand 
an important literary undertaking which will require solid 
work in biographical and historical writing of the highest 
character on American subjects. It will be work upon which 
the younger generation of historical scholars in particular may 
build reputations, and the financial return will be as large as 
the market permits. Men who have had thorough training 
in the use of original materials, and are masters of a good 
English style, may learn particulars by addressing :

SECONDARY ENGLISH TEXTS 



A Thoroughly Modern and Practical 
Text- Book in 

Composition and Rhetoric 
for Schools 

By ROBERT HERRICK, A.B., Assistant Professor 
of English in the University of Chicago ; and 
LINDSAY TODD DAMON, A.B., Instructor in 
English in the University of Chicago. 
This book embodies the most recently accepted 

method in English teaching in secondary schools. It 

has some distinctive features. 

INVENTIONAL WORK in shaping and arranging 
thought receives the first attention. The student is 
aided in discovering and developing his powers of 
expression both by the skilful directions of the book 
and by the work of theme-writing. The criticism of 
themes is at first suggestive, not repressive and dis- 
couraging. Genuine interest and self-confidence will 
follow this method of work, and the student will rap- 
idly mature the power of written expression. 

RHETORICAL THEORY as such is not presented 
until the second part of the book, where it is taken up 
systematically. The study of good use in words, of 
diction, and of the rhetorical laws of the sentence and 
the paragraph, is followed by a general review of lit- 
erary laws as applied to the whole composition. 

THE EXERCISES present many original and 
valuable features. They are suggestive, interesting, 
carefully chosen as to subject matter, and within the 
range of the average student's experience and knowl- 
edge. 

ALREADY ADOPTED in the High Schools of 
200 cities, of which 
16 have a population of between 5,000 and 10,000 

each. 
23 have a population of between 10,000 and 20,000 

each. 
22 have a population of over 20,000 each. 

In addition, it is in use in 58 Preparatory Schools 
especially fitting for the larger Universities, and also 
in a large number of other Academies, Seminaries, 
Normal Schools, and Secondary Institutions.

RED POTTAGE 

SO much has been written and said of "RED POTTAGE" that there is 
little left for the publishers to add. It is perhaps enough to call attention 
to the fact that " RED POTTAGE " has been published scarcely fourteen 
weeks, and that already nine editions have been printed. The daily sales 
have now run into the thousands, and the demand is steadily increasing.

Special Notice 

THE " Avon " fount of small pica type, upon which Mr. Bicketts has long 
been engaged, is now complete. It has been specially designed for printing 
the JplapS Of ^&&ak00p0at0 No edition of them at present exists that is nota- 
ble as a finely printed book on paper whose permanence is undoubted. The edition 
of ^>f)ak00p0ar0'0 Plapg which will shortly be issued by the $al0 Pt00$ 
will be printed in this new type, and the fount will not be used for any other 
books, at least until the Plays are completed. 

The aim of the H?al0 ^bak00p0at0 is to be thoroughly handy and readable. 
While no attempt will be made to illustrate the Plays, an entirely new scheme of 
decoration has been prepared for them, .including borders and half-borders cut 
in brass and on wood from Mr. Bicketts' designs. The paper, specially made 
by Messrs. Arnold, is distinguished from the previous Vale papers by a new 
water-mark a Mermaid. 

The Text has been edited by Mr. T. S. Moore, who edited the Yale Press 
Editions of " Shakespeare's Sonnets" and "The Passionate Pilgrim," now out 
of print. It will be conservative in its tendencies, being based upon the early 
Folio editions, though the results of modern research will be recognized, and, as 
a matter of practical convenience, the Plays will be printed in modern spelling. 

Each Play will be issued in a single demy 8vo volume, bound in cloth and 
stamped in blind from a design by Mr. Bicketts. Though the series will be 
uniform in outward appearance, separate schemes of internal decoration have 
been arranged for the "Tragedies," the " Comedies," and the "Histories." 

Only 310 sets of the $al0 ^>&ak00p0ar0 will be printed, of which 100 sets 
are for sale in the United States of America, and 187 sets in Great Britain. 
The imprint in both countries will be identical, viz.: Sold by Hacon & Kicketts, 
London, and by John Lane, New York. The series will never be reprinted. 
The plays will be issued at $6.00 per volume net. The first Play, " Iatttl0t," 
will appear at the beginning of March, and succeeding volumes will be published 
at intervals of one month from that date. 

The last twelve books issued from the $al0 PC000 have all been fully 
subscribed before publication, and are now at a considerable premium. 

The whole of the English edition of the $al0 ^)|)ak0$p0at0 has been taken 
up by collectors and the trade.

PHILADELPHIA PRESS: 

" One of those fortunate works of fiction that 
are predestined to extraordinary success. . . . 
It can be safely said that none of the fiction 
which has sold by hundreds of thousands in the 
past two or three years equals in literary merit, 
in freshness of plot, in the delineation of char- 
acter, in fertility of invention, and in all the 
qualities that engage and hold the attention, 
this most pleasing and satisfactory of contempo- 
rary romances." 

THE BROOKLYN EAGLE, speaking of Miss 
Johnston's two novels, pronounces them 

" Tales that are wonderful for their sustained 
strength, wealth of color, beauty of style, origi- 
nality of conception and poetic atmosphere, and 
asks : At what fountain of inspiration has she 
drunk so deeply that her spirit flies so high and 
so strong ? "

NEW YORK TRIBUNE: 

"One of the best historical romances we 
have had from any contemporary writer of fic- 
tion on either side of the Atlantic. . . The action 
is always interesting and sometimes it is thrill- 
ing. ... It is all good history and good ro- 
mance, blended with art and animated by that 
spontaneous inspiration without which art is 
useless." 

NEW YORK MAIL AND EXPRESS: 

" Colonial Virginia is a happy hunting-ground 
for the novelist. It offers greater contrasts, 
brighter colors, wider possibilities than does the 
North, with its more uniform grayness and lack 
of wide social diversities. 

" Miss Johnston's fertility of invention, her 
ingeniousness of construction has found full play 
in her tale. . . . She knows how to write, and 
how to describe."

DEMOCRACY AND EMPIRE. 

By Professor FRANKLIN H. GIDDINGS, Columbia University, author of "The Principles of 

Sociology," etc. Cloth, 12mo, $2.50. 

Both democracy and empire are essentially phases of a great ethical movement, which is lifting the whole 

human race. From this point of view they are described in these essays. The keynote is struck in the opening 

paper on "The Ethical Motive." Then follow, among others, discussions of "The Costs of Progress," of "The 

Nature and Conduct of Political Majorities," of " The Destinies of Democracy," of " The Relation of Social 

Democracy to the Higher Education," and of "The Popular Instruction Most Necessary in a Democracy."

WHERE OUR SCHOOLS FAIL MOST. 

It will be remembered by those who take 
account of such things, that in the year 1893 
a number of educational experts from different 
parts of Europe visited our country and studied 
our schools and school systems, often in school- 
houses and in superintendents' offices, as well 
as in the educational exhibit made at Chicago ; 
and that many of them, on their return home, 
published their observations and impressions, 
some in books and some in official reports, the 
whole mass forming a valuable body of informa- 
tion and criticism. Much of this material 
(especially when it took the form of official 
reports) Dr. Harris, the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation, reproduced in a more or less abridged 
form in his Report for the year of the Great 
Exposition. One of the documents that he so 
treated was the Report of Dr. E. Schlee, Direc- 
tor of the Real Gymnasium at Altona, Ger- 
many, who had put his finger thus firmly upon 
the spot where, in his view, American schools 
fail most : 

" If in every office the chief factor is the man, and in 
school the teachers, we have come to the weakest point 
in the American school system: professional teachers 
are wanting. That is to say, that most teachers are 
deficient in the requisite scientific and pedagogic pre- 
paration for their vocation. The greatest number are 
women, and comparatively few make a profession of 
teaching. 

" According to the American way of looking at things, 
no importance is attached to the technical preparation 
for occupations and vocations or professions. Profes- 
sions are changed according to advantages or oppor- 
tunities. In annual reports we repeatedly meet with 
complaints of the fact that the teachers, men and women, 
have little or no normal or scientific education, and that 
they must be appointed without regard to the necessary 
knowledge and pedagogic preparation." 

Reviewing our facilities for providing quali- 
fied teachers for the elementary schools, Dr. 
Schlee said : 

" On account of frequent resignations, the yearly 
demand for teachers in America is astonishingly great ; 
one-third of the number needed annually can scarcely be 
met by the Normal schools." 

His account of secondary teachers is hardly 
more favorable. 

" Teachers of high schools have, as a rule, graduated 
from high schools; and for the most part have for a 
time attended a college, a university, or a normal school, 
before taking the teacher's examination. Generally 



142 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



speaking, however, the situation is about the same with 
them as it is with those of the lower schools." 

That Dr. Schlee's view is the one commonly 
held by the most competent experts who visit 
us from abroad, and that it is also the view 
taken by our own most competent judges, is too 
well known to call for more than the slightest 
mention. 

How admirably the German specialist puts 
it ! " If in every office the chief factor is the 
man, and in school the teachers, we have come 
to the weakest point in the American school 
system : professional teachers are wanting." 

This judgment involves two main points. 
One is the great lack of our teachers, as a body, 
in respect to academical and professional pre- 
paration ; and the other, the rapid and cease- 
less changes in the body itself. The two defects 
are more closely connected than some may 
think. Poor preparation leads assuredly to 
keeping the body in a state of ceaseless motion, 
while such motion is very unfavorable in itself 
to good preparation. 

The value of the good teacher is one of the 
lessons that mankind has been very slow to 
learn. From the days of Plutarch, we have a 
continuous stream of testimony bearing on this 
point. Again, the good teacher is not as highly 
appreciated in the United States as he is in the 
well-educated countries of Europe. It may 
seem a paradox, but it is the truth, to say that 
American teachers as a class, and the Ameri- 
can people as a whole, earnest as both are, have 
never taken the teacher's calling, as such, very 
seriously. The vast majority of teachers, in 
fact, do not look upon it as a calling at all, but 
only as an episode lying between school and a 
calling or as a prelude to the main action of life. 

It is often said that there are no highly civil- 
ized people in the world who place so low an 
estimate as we Americans do upon expert 
knowledge and skill of any kind. This is per- 
fectly true, although Dr. Schlee indulges in 
some exaggeration in his putting of the case ; 
and it is impossible to tell how much we suffer in 
consequence. Causes that are perfectly famil- 
iar to students of such matters, have operated 
to produce in our country a type of character 
that is remarkably efficient and versatile, so 
much so, in fact, that it is hard for us to believe 
that we cannot do anything we may undertake 
to do, no matter whether we have prepared our- 
selves to do it or know much about it or not. 
That great friend of our country, John Stuart 
Mill, once spoke of this tendency as one of the 
serious defects in our character. That it stands 



in the way of our achieving the highest results 
in many lines of activity, is beyond all question. 

Once more there is reason to believe that we 
have a lower estimate of practical pedagogical 
ability than of any other highly specialized 
form of ability. Upon what other serious call- 
ing do we look so lightly ? Certainly not upon 
medicine, the bar, or the ministry. That 
teaching the formation of the bodies and 
minds, the manners and the morals, of children 
and youth is a refined and delicate art, call- 
ing for much skill and high excellence of char- 
acter, ought to be too plain to make serious 
argument on that point necessary. 

I do not for a moment forget three things 
that are essential to a just view of the subject: 
(1), that many of our teachers do look upon 
the work as a calling, although the number is 
relatively small ; (2), that the number of such 
teachers is increasing steadily, if not rapidly ; 
and (3), that many persons who have done a 
few years' work at teaching, on their way to a 
calling, have rendered the public excellent 
services. Nevertheless, the fact cannot be too 
much emphasized that the United States will 
never become an educational state of the same 
rank as Prussia or Saxony until teaching as- 
sumes a position and a dignity among us that 
it has never yet known. 

One of the facts that give Massachusetts 
her preeminence as an educational state is the 
high standard of attainment that is required 
of teachers. In 1888-89 the teachers in her 
common schools who had attended a normal 
school were 33.3 per cent, of the total number, 
while the graduates of such schools were 26.6 
per cent. In 1897-98 the corresponding per 
cents were 38.5 and 33.5. That is, at the first 
date about a quarter of the teachers were nor- 
mal school graduates ; and at the other date, 
about a third. The Secretary of the State 
Board of Education, Mr. Frank A. Hill, gave 
this account of the 61.5 per cent who had not 
attended a normal school : A few have prob- 
ably been appointed without reference to their 
preparation or fitness for the work ; some had 
had a little preliminary experience in local 
schools for the purpose ; some had begun to 
teach before normal school preparation had 
attracted the attention of school committees as 
an important prerequisite ; while some were 
College graduates. This is certainly an encour- 
aging showing, compared with the day when 
Horace Mann said, in substance, that outside 
of the city of Boston there were not more than 
two hundred teachers who could be said to

follow teaching as a calling in that state. It 
is also encouraging in comparison with the 
showing that any other American state could 
make. But it is distinctly discouraging when 
considered in connection with Prussia or 
Saxony. 

Statistics that would fully reveal the exact 
state of things, the country over, are, unfor- 
tunately, not attainable. We know that a 
great army of teachers is employed, that this 
army is rapidly increasing in numbers, and that 
the average term of service is a short one. In 
1897-98 this army counted 409,193 teachers, 
which was 5,860 more than the year before. 
Again, if ten per cent, of these teachers go out 
of the service every year (a very moderate 
estimate), 41,000 new teachers are required 
to keep up the wastage. Putting the facts 
together, it is safe to say that the annual de- 
mand for common-school teachers at the present 
time is 50,000. Where does the supply come 
from? 

For the year 1897-98 the Commissioner of 
Education found 67,538 students in teachers' 
training courses of all kinds, reaching from the 
high school to the university. He also found 
11,255 graduates from normal schools be- 
tween a fifth and a fourth of the total number 
of the recruits required to keep the ranks full. 
This is a liberal view to take of the matter. 
President Schurman, of Cornell University, 
has calculated, from data furnished by the 
Bureau of Education, that in 1891-92 the total 
annual increase in the number of teachers em- 
ployed in the schools was less than two per cent, 
of the whole number, that nearly seventeen per 
cent, of the whole number were wholly inex- 
perienced, that the average length of service 
was between seven and eight years, and that 
only fifteen per cent, of the teachers in the 
schools of the country had passed through a 
normal school. 

While much has been said and written upon 
the two defects in our system that we are con- 
sidering the ill preparation of teachers when 
they enter the schools, and the frequent chan- 
ges within the body not much has been said, 
so far as I am aware, upon their relative mag- 
nitude or seriousness. How do they compare ? 
Probably most persons would lay emphasis, and 
perhaps heavy emphasis, upon ill preparation. 
This may be the true view, but I am not fully 
pursuaded that it is so. Let us look into the 
matter more closely. 

Mr. William E. Anderson, when Superin- 
tendent of the Schools of Milwaukee, ten or 



twelve years ago, found the changes in the 
personnel of the teaching corps of that city to 
be from ten to twelve per cent, annually. A 
well-known Michigan superintendent found 
the ratio to be about the same in his city. 
Applying this ratio to such cities as Chicago, 
Philadelphia, and New York, what an appall- 
ing result we have ! But this is not all : 
changes in tine personnel of the force necesitate 
changes in the assignment of the remaining 
teachers to schools and grades, and these changes 
are probably equal in number to those resulting 
from the other cause. It is easy to say that some 
of these changes are for the good of the schools; 
that some of the teachers who come are better 
than some who go, and that inter-school and 
inter-grade changes are often beneficial. This 
is true enough, but it is no proper offset to 
the evil that flows from unnecessary or un- 
desirable changes. It is undeniable that 
changes in the corps is one of the great sour- 
ces of waste in our public schools. No one 
knows this better than the experienced super- 
intendent. He labors hard to get his force in 
good working order, to effect the necessary 
adjustments upon which the success of the 
schools so closely depends, and only to see 
the whole organism broken up, or seriously 
deranged, at the end of the year. 

This is in the cities. In the rural districts 
the case is still worse. In 1886 a competent 
authority found that the schools in Calhoun 
County, Michigan, required 158 teachers, and 
that 342 different ones were employed in the 
course of the year ; also that the average length 
of the school year in the county was 8.4 months, 
while the average time for which the teachers 
served was but 3.8 months. He found also 
that the ratio of the teachers required to the 
teachers employed was about the same through- 
out the state, the tenure being longer in the 
newer counties than in the older ones. Since 
that time there has been a considerable, if not 
a marked, improvement in the mode of employ- 
ing teachers in Michigan, as well as in other 
states ; but the reform should go still farther. 
Why should not people change their bankers, 
lawyers, ministers, dentists, physicians, once in 
three or six months as well as their teachers ? 

We may scrutinize still more closely the loss 
that unnecessary changes entail upon the pupils 
of schools. We may justly say that a large 
majority of the inexperienced teachers wish to 
do their duty, and make an effort to do it ; 
they try to overcome in some measure their 
limitations arising out of their lack of prepar- 



144 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



ation, for which they are by no means fully 
responsible ; and, as the result of wish and 
effort, they make some commendable progress 
in mastering their art. But by the time they, 
or many of them, come to be really useful to 
their employers, they retire from the work, 
making room for new teachers who are as inex- 
perienced as they were at the beginning, and 
thus the Sysyphian labor is renewed. At what 
cost to pupils is the progress made by these 
successive relays of teachers earned ! Some 
years ago, a Kentucky court, seeking to cut off 
some of the circumventions by which teachers 
strive to evade the law in regard to certificates, 
made these very pertinent remarks : 

" The purpose of requiring a certificate is to be as- 
sured of the qualifications of the teacher in advance. 
He is not to practice on his pupils, keep one day ahead 
of his class, and thus, by going to school to himself, fit 
himself to stand the ordeal of an examination which he 
could not have stood at the beginning. Such a pro- 
cedure is a fraud on the district." 

The principle here involved would bear much 
wider application. The procedure described is 
not only " a fraud on the district," but it is a 
crime on the children. How many teachers in 
the United States at the present time learn to 
teach, so far as they do learn, by " practicing 
on their pupils," and thus " going to school to 
themselves " ! 

In view of all the premises, what should be 
done ? What is the demand of the hour ? The 
comprehensive answer to this question is, Raise 
the teacher's calling in the estimation of teach- 
ers and of the whole people. How shall this 
be done ? Of the numerous points that a full 
answer to this second question would involve, 
I mention only three, and these as briefly as 
possible. 

1. The character of the teaching function, 
and especially the teacher's calling, must be 
made the subject of constant direct appeal to 
the public. There is urgent need of an educa- 
tional campaign on the subject of education 
under its theoretical, practical, and historical 
aspects. 

2. The preparation of teachers must be im- 
proved by direct efforts to that end. It is an 
undeniable fact, and a cheering one, that as a 
rule the better the work the teacher does, the 
longer his term of service. There can be no 
doubt that one reason why the tenure of city 
teachers is longer than country teachers is the 
fact that, as a class, they represent a much 
higher grade of preparation. 

3. The folly of the incessant changes occur- 



ring in our corps of teachers must be dealt with 
directly and effectively, as far as possible. This 
will conduce to better preparation and to bet- 
ter teaching. It is true, of course, that the 
teaching body as a whole will undergo, and 
ought to undergo, constant changes, since 
changes are incident to human life and society ; 
but this is no defence of the wretched system 
that prevails at present. 

In this struggle there is much to encourage 
the friends of education. Dr. Harris has shown 
that from 1880 to 1897 the enrollment in public 
normal schools increased from about 10,000 to 
over 40,000 pupils, or fourfold ; and that in the 
same period private normal schools increased 
from 2,000 to 24,000, or twelvefold. In 1880 
there were 240 normal students in each million 
of inhabitants ; in 1897 there were 976 in each 
million. We may take courage from the un- 
doubted fact that education in the United 
States, inferior as it may be in many respects, 
is still on the rising grade.

BYRON'S INFLUENCE UPON GOETHE* 



" I have simply run through the world. I have clutched 
everything by the hair. ... I have longed and attained, and 
then longed again, and thus with might have stormed through 
life." 

These words of the aged Faust, who, nearing his 
end, casts a retrospective glance over his past life, 
might well be taken to characterize Byron. But 
only so far as we quote is the passage applicable : of 
the development hinted at in the following lines, he 
was utterly incapable. Flaring up like some strange 
meteor before the gaze of his astonished contempo- 
raries, his sudden plunge from the highest heights 
into death was far more favorable for his fame than 
a gradual decline and a lingering setting would have 
been. It was not without reason that Goethe 
said: 

" Although Byron died so young, yet literature has not lost 
materially by him, so far as a more extended range of writing 
is concerned. He had reached the height of his creative 
power, and, whatever he might have written afterward, he 
could not have passed the natural boundaries of his talent." 

The last stage of the development of Byron is 
that of his " Cain," who goes into exile uttering the 
despairing cry, "And I?" The answer to this 
pessimism is to be found in the Second Part of 
" Faust." 

The date of Goethe's first acquaintance with 
Byron's works cannot be exactly determined. It

of " Childe Harold ") and 1816. On May 4 of the 
latter year he wrote to Eichstadt, " I have just 
learned of the English poet Lord Byron, who de- 
serves our interest," and inquires after a life of 
the poet. Corresponding to this is an entry in the 
" Tag und Jahresheften," 1816 : 

" My interest in foreign literature centred actively upon the 
poems of Byron, who became ever more prominent and 
attracted me to him more and more, notwithstanding the fact 
that at first he had repelled me by his hypochondriacal pas- 
sion and by his bitter self-hatred, and that it was only with 
difficulty that I could approach his great personality. I read 
the ' Corsair ' and ' Lara ' not without sympathy and admira- 
tion." 

From this statement we perceive that at first the 
fully-rounded nature of the German Altmeister 
found great difficulty in befriending itself with the 
skeptical, one-sided, misanthropic poet. In the fol- 
lowing year, however, his interest was not less 
active. 

"English poetry and literature occupied a most prominent 
place this year. The more the public acquainted itself with 
the peculiarities of Lord Byron's wonderful spirit, the more 
sympathy he gained, so that men and women, youths and 
maidens, appeared to forget their Oerman nationality. As it 
became easier to obtain his works, I also formed the habit of 
busying myself with him more and more. He became to me 
a valued contemporary, and I followed him eagerly upon the 
wandering paths of his life." 

From this time on we find repeatedly in Goethe's 
journals, letters, and conversations references to this 
or that work of Byron. His interest is especially 
excited by the publication of " Manfred," in 1817. 
On the 13th of October of that year he writes to 
Knebel : 

"The most noteworthy publication of recent date was the 
tragedy ' Manfred,' by Byron. This remarkable poet has 
absorbed my ' Faust,' and has drawn out from it the strangest 
food for his hypochondria. He has used every motive in his 
own way, so that not one of them is identical [with mine], 
and just for this very reason I cannot sufficiently admire his 
genius. . . . Yet withal I do not deny that the sullen glow of 
an unbounded despair becomes wearisome after a time. And 
still the vexation which one feels is always coupled with re- 
spect and admiration." 

To Boisse're'e he writes, on the first of May, 1818, 
that " an extraordinary spirit, great talent, insight 
into the world, and self-consciousness reign therein " 
(i. e., in "Manfred") ; and in "Kanst und Alter- 
tum " he devotes a detailed discussion to it, part of 
which runs as follows : 

" We find, then, here the real quintessence of the opinions 
and passions of this most wonderful talent, born to self- 
torment. . . . He has often enough confessed what tortures 
him ; he has presented it repeatedly, until hardly anyone has 
sympathy longer with that unendurable suffering of his." 

These strictures show that Goethe's admiration was 
tempered by a healthy scorn of Byron's unwhole- 
some melancholy. 

Goethe's assertion that Byron had imitated 
" Faust," and his assumption that " Manfred" had 
for its foundation a double murder caused by the 
poet's passion for a married woman in Florence, 
were sufficient to touch the sensitive Englishman 
to the quick. He decided to revenge himself on 
Goethe by an ironical dedication to him of his 



"Marino Falieri." The dedication was written, 
and sent to his publisher, Murray ; but the latter 
had the good sense to suppress it. Ten years later, 
Goethe learned of this dedication through the 
younger Murray. 

From " Manfred " Goethe translated the " Curse " 
(I. 1), and the "Monologue" (II. 2), of which 
latter he said, " Hamlet's Soliloquy appears here 
intensified." It is not without interest to compare 
these two translations with the original. The 
" Curse " is translated into the original metre, but 
without rhyme. The sense of the " Monologue " is 
given for the most part excellently, but one notes a 
few minor errors.

"Tage

weg." 

GOETHE. 

" In all' den Tagen der ver- 
wunschten Posse." 



Goethe has evidently read joke for yoke, and it is 
possible that the edition which he used contained 
this misprint, although I have not found it in any 
edition accessible to me. 
Again we read : 

BYRON. 

" What is she now ? a suf- 
ferer for my sins

Here Goethe has entirely missed the meaning. 



BYRON. 

' And champion

GOETHE. 

"Der Erde Schreeken puf* 
ichauf." 



It is praise rather than blame to say that Goethe 
was not a good translator. His translations lack 
entirely the Byronic tone, and are no longer Byron, 
but Goethe. The transmutation is so complete as 
to be striking in the highest degree. 

For " Kunst und Altertum" Goethe wrote a 
notice of the first two cantos of " Don Juan " (1821), 
and translated the first five stanzas of this work. 
" Cain " also received a full discussion from his 
pen. 

In spite of noteworthy waverings of opinion, 
Goethe's admiration for Byron grew with his years, 
but from the very first he had estimated the poet's, 
character correctly. From the oft-quoted passages- 
in his letters and conversations we need not again- 
adduce examples as evidence. Byron, for his part, 
seems to have been flattered by so much attention- 
from the older master, and sent him in 1821 a 
proposed dedication to " Sardanapalus," inscribed 
to him in the most flattering terms, and attended by 
a request for permission to print it at the beginning 
of the drama. The dedication was accepted, but,, 
through the carelessness of Murray, was omitted in. 
printing. "Notwithstanding this," says Goethe,. 
" the noble Lord did not give up his intention of 
showing a signal evidence of friendly feeling to his 
German contemporary and literary comrade ; and

consequently the Tragedy ' Werner ' hears on its 
front a highly-prized memorial." 

In the spring of 1823 an English traveller brought 
a letter from Byron to Weimar, which Goethe an- 
swered hy the well-known poem, 

" Ein freundlich Wort komrat ernes nach dem Andern," 
mingling friendly admonition with cordial appre- 
ciation. Byron had already set sail for Greece, but 
was detained by a storm in the harbor of Leghorn, 
and here Goethe's answer reached him. He replied 
by a written greeting. 

So much for the personal and literary relations 
of the two during Byron's lifetime. It is not within 
the limits of our task to consider Goethe's influence 
on Byron, however interesting the investigation 
might prove. Byron owes the form at least of his 
" Manfred " and " Deformed Transformed " to 
Goethe, as well as the opening lines of the " Bride 
of Abydos," which he imitated from Mignon's song, 
as translated by Madame de Stae'l into French. 
All of Byron's knowledge of German authors was 
through translations or through the kind offices of 
Shelley and of " Monk " Lewis. On the other hand, 
the youthful and erratic genius of Byron had worked 
as a mighty inspiration upon Goethe, bearing as its 
fruit the character of Euphorion in the Second Part 
of " Faust." Yet even at this late stage the ten- 
dency to blame as well as praise the English poet 
was manifest, for we know that Goethe had at 
one time intended to satirize Byron as one of the 
throng of poets introduced into the Second Part of 
" Faust." 

Besides the traces of Byron which we have just 
mentioned, Goethe has adapted one of Byron's epi- 
grams, a fact which seems to have been overlooked 
up to this time. We quote first Goethe's rendition : 
" Nein, fur den Poeten ist's zu viel. 
Dieses entsetzliche Strafgericht. 
Verdanmit ist mein Trauerspiel, 
Und die alte Tante nicht ! " 

This is first published in 1833. The original is not 
found in Byron's collected works, but in Medwin's 
" Conversations with Byron." 

" Behold the blessings of a happy lot 1 
My play is damned, and Lady is not ! " 

Medwin explains the epigram as an allusion to two 
letters received by Byron in the same mail, the one 
containing the news that " Marino Falieri " had 
failed at Drury Lane Theatre ; and the other, that 
an old woman [Lady Milbanke?], from whom he 
had expected to inherit money, would probably sur- 
vive her hundredth birthday. Without this explana- 
tion, Goethe's epigram, as well as that of Byron, is 
sheer nonsense. 

A satirical stanza, beginning, 

" Lord Byron ohne Scham nnd Schein," 

may be referred to here, merely for the sake of 
completeness. The introduction of the poet's name 
alone connects the verse with him. In Goethe's 
posthumous writings occurs another poem referring 
to Byron, i. e., 

" Stark von Faust, gewandt im Rat." 



Eckermann would have us believe that the Ma- 
rienbad Elegy was influenced by Byron, because 
greater strength of feeling is expressed in it than in 
other of Goethe's poems written at this time ! It is 
true that Goethe told the Chancellor von Mttller that 
everybody in Marienbad was talking about Byron 
and Scott, but is not Goethe's ardor to be ascribed 
rather to his sudden and passionate admiration for 
Ulrike von Levezow than to so remote a cause ? 
This absurd proposition is an excellent example of 
the lengths to which a would-be literateur will go 
when out on a Quellenjagd. 

In the third act of the Second Part of " Faust " 
is Byron's real memorial at the hands of Goethe. 
This third act appeared for the first time in 1827, 
under the title " Helena." The son of Faust the 
exponent of Romanticism, and of Helena the expo- 
nent of the classic spirit, appears here as Euphorion- 
Byron, the exponent of the modern subjective age. 
Goethe himself has given us the key to his charac- 
terization. 

" As representative of the most recent poetic period, I could 
use no one except him who is to be regarded as without ques- 
tion the greatest talent of the century. And then, Byron is 
not antique, neither is he romantic, but he is like the present 
day itself. I had to have such a character. He suited also 
perfectly because of his discontented nature, and of his com- 
bative tendency, which brought him to destruction at Misso- 
lunghi. ... I had planned the catastrophe formerly in quite 
another manner and once quite well. Then time brought 
me this matter of Byron and Missolunghi, and I let every- 
thing else go." 

And how was Euphorion to be conceived ? Let 
us read a few sentences from Goethe's own charac- 
terization of Byron, one of the most shrewd analyses 
of the poet existent. 

"One may very well say that bis uncontrolled nature was 
his ruin. . . . He lived passionately for each day, without 
thought of the morrow, nor did he consider what he did. . . . 
Everywhere the bounds were too narrow for him, and even 
with the most unlimited personal liberty he felt himself rest- 
ive. . . . He felt ever the poetic impulse, and all that ema- 
nated from the man, especially from his heart, was excellent." 

Goethe said this to Eckermann in 1825, that is, 
just at the time when he had resumed work on the 
" Helena " and was vigorously pushing it forward. 
And all that he expresses here as a critic, he repeats 
in '* Faust " as a poet. 

Let us examine the conception of Euphorion in 
detail. 

Soon after his miraculous birth the heavenly boy 
seizes the lyre, " already announcing himself as the 
future master of all beauty, in whose members 
eternal harmonies are stirring." At once Phorkyas 
proclaims that the time of the old gods is past, and 
that the time of the new subjective song has come. 
" List ! the fairest harmonies ! Quickly free yourself from 
fables. Away with the old multitude of your gods, their 
day is past. No one will understand you longer : we demand 
a higher tribute ; for that must come from the heart which is 
to work upon the heart." 

Compare with this the last sentence in the quota- 
tion above : " And all which emanated from the 
man, especially from his heart, was excellent." 
Euphorion's restless nature, ever striving upward

and onward, and forgetting itself only for the mo- 
ment even in love's dalliance, now finds its ade- 
quate expression. This same unrestrained, restless 
longing in the real prototype Goethe excellently 
characterizes as his tendency toward the limitless. 
It is Byron himself, the Byron of " Cain " and of 
" Manfred," who says : " That which is easily gained 
is repulsive to me. Only that which is won by force 
really delights me." 

The all-ruling love of nature, so evident through- 
out Byron's poems, finds beautiful expression in 
Goethe's verses. 

"A crowding of rocks here, between the forest thickets. 
Why these bounds for me, me who am young and strong ? 
The winds are rushing there, the waves are roaring there, 
I hear both from afar, fain were I near." 

" It was too narrow for him everywhere," says 
Goethe. Then follows the allusion to his revolu- 
tionary spirit : 

" Will you bring in the day of peace by dreaming ? Dream 
he who may. War is the watchword." 

And upon this follows the last flight, the fall : 
" Icarus ! Icarus ! Sorrow enough ! " 

Goethe is not the only German who has composed 
a dirge upon Byron. We recall those of Alfred 
Meissner, of Heine, of Wilhelm Muller ; but none 
has equalled his in quiet, sorrowful majesty. 
"Not alone, wheresoe'er thou tarriest." 

Goethe says himself : " The chorus falls entirely 
out of its role in this elegy ; it suddenly becomes 
earnest and highly reflective, and utters that of 
which it never thought and never could think." 
This is a true statement, not, however, a true criti- 
cism. Lovingly, with almost womanly idealization, 
Goethe has set Byron a memorial such as his own 
nation never dreamed of. Banned from his own 
country during his lifetime, wilfully misunderstood 
and misrepresented after his death, he found else- 
where universally recognition and acceptance. 

In conclusion, we venture to assert that what 
really influenced Goethe was Byron's brilliant per- 
sonality and romantic life, to which the fact of his 
being a " noble Lord " undoubtedly lent additional 
charm. Of a distinct literary influence there is no 
trace. But that the greatest German of his age was 
so quick to recognize in Byron a poetic spirit of 
high order, perhaps of the highest order, ought not 
be forgotten at the moment of our somewhat tardy 

Byron-revival. ,., -r,

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A QUESTION OF PROPRIETY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his excellent articles on Henrik Ibsen, published 
in THE DIAL during recent years (the last one being 
in the issue for February 16), Mr. William Morton 
Payne seems to delight in referring to the poet as Dr. 
Ibsen. To be sure, it is perfectly correct to do so, as 



Ibsen has received the degree from a university of 
recognized standing, but is it necessary and desirable 
to call a great poet doctor ? Suppose Oxford or Cam- 
bridge had conferred the same degree upon Shakes- 
peare, Milton, Byron, or Shelley : would it not offend 
us to hear the critics speak of Dr. Shakespeare, Dr. 
Milton, Dr. Byron, or Dr. Shelley ? It is true we refer 
to Samuel Johnson as Dr. Johnson, but his case is dif- 
ferent. He courted the title and was flattered by it. 
I have heard many intelligent admirers of the great 
Norwegian dramatist offer protests against Mr. Payne's 
practice of calling him Dr. Ibsen. A great poet needs 
no honorary degree : he is great enough without it, 
and, instead of adding dignity to his name, it seems 
to detract. Ibsen did not court any degree ; his 
countrymen never call him Dr. Ibsen, and are inclined 
to ridicule those who do as pedantic. 

MARTIN ODLAND. 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, Feb. 23, 1900. 

[The writer referred to in the above communica- 
tion simply follows the uniform practice of THE 
DIAL in mentioning the names of living men and 
women. We believe it to be a matter of the merest 
good manners to speak of people in print as we 
should speak to them in private conversation. If 
we were addressing Dr. Ibsen personally, we cer- 
tainly should not call him " Ibsen," and are unwill- 
ing to offer him that discourtesy when writing about 
him. If we did not call him " Dr." we should be 
obliged to call him " Herr," which our critic would 
probably think equally pedantic. Thus the cases 
of Shakespeare and Byron, who are not among the 
living, have no bearing upon the question. Our 
practice in this matter illustrates one of those "little 
touches " to use Professor Peck's phrase that 
mean so much to persons of refined taste. The 
habit which Germans and Scandinavians have of 
denying in print to their living fellow-countrymen 
the titles whereby gentlemen designate one another 
is a thing which as far as it goes indicates an 
imperfect civilization, and it is one of the minor de- 
pravities of the American newspaper that it so 
encourages this form of rudeness that we should now 
be taken to task for observing the ordinary ameni- 
ties of social intercourse. EDR. THE DIAL.] 

"JANE AUSTEN AND THACKERAY." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In regard to the question (if question it be) raised 
in Mr. Matthews's letter on " Jane Austen and Thack- 
eray " in your current number, let me suggest that a 
reference to Mrs. Ritchie's " Chapters from Some Un- 
written Memoirs " will clear up the matter. Mrs. 
Ritchie tells a story there, if I remember aright, of a 
meeting between her father and Miss Bronte that may 
well have been floating vaguely in the mind of the New 
York newspaper writer when he described, on Mrs. 
Ritchie's authority, Thackeray's wonderful encounter 
with Miss Austen. The substitution of Jane Austen 
for the author of " Jane Eyre " was an easy matter for 
a trained journalist.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE BRITISH ARMY.* 

Mr. Fortescue is a civilian, but his scholarly 
"History of the British Army" cannot fail to 
win the respect of the intelligent military read- 
er. Mr. Fortescue's valuable book is con- 
ceived and thus far carried out in the spirit of 
the scientific historian. The more romantic 
and picturesque side of his theme has for him 
but a secondary interest; and this we must 
consider a fortunate characteristic, since, while 
the exploits in the field of the British Army 
have been more than sufficiently celebrated in 
sounding prose by competent pens, the not less 
important record of its growth or evolution ab 
ovo as a national establishment has hitherto 
been strangely neglected. 

It is to this comparatively unworked field of 
research that Mr. Fortescue mainly applies him- 
self. In thus stating what appears to us to be 
the essential or distinctive feature of the work 
it is not intended to imply that the author has 
neglected the military aspect of his subject. 
It would be impossible to write even what 
may be called the bare natural history of the 
British Army without depicting in some detail 
the great battles and campaigns which materi- 
ally affected its development and character by 
instituting more or less radical changes in 
organization, tactics, or equipments. Mr. For- 
tescue's account of the political and adminis- 
trative side of British military history thus 
runs concurrently with the judiciously com- 
pressed and selective recital of the British 
soldier's achievements in the field, the reader 
being constantly reminded that it is primarily 
the evolution of the Army as a national estab- 
lishment that the author is aiming to trace out 
and illustrate. 

Mr. Fortescue's powers of picturesque descrip- 
tion are moderate ; his analysis of military oper- 
ations is concise and clear ; and the fact that he 
is a civilian has not deterred him from exercis- 
ing a considerable degree of independence of 
judgment. The average reader, accustomed to 
the conventional view of General Wolfe, will 
be surprised at Mr. Fortescue's estimate of 
the much vaunted victory on the plains of 
Abraham, which was due more to good luck 
and the virtual mental collapse of the French 
commander than to good generalship, and was 

* A HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY. By the Hon. J. W. 
Fortescue. In two volumes, with maps. New York : The

essentially a gambler's throw of a general who 
had failed to see his real strategical opportu- 
nity. Says Mr. Fortescue : 

"... It is quite incontestible that the credit for the 
fall of Quebec belongs rather to the Navy than to the 
Army. ... It still remains for enquiry why Wolfe did 
not take earlier advantage of the opportunities opened 
to him by the fleet; and even after allowance is made 
for his constant illness, the answer is not readily found. 
The measures which led to the decisive action were, as 
has been told, taken on the advice of his brigadiers, 
and, if Montcalm had not succumbed to positive infa- 
tuation, would very likely have brought Wolfe to a 
court-martial. " 

It is easy, as the author observes, to be wise 
after the event ; but a careful analysis of the 
whole record of the operations at Quebec goes 
to show that Wolfe's reputation as a soldier 
has been somewhat unduly enhanced by the 
tradition of his virtues as a man and of his 
heroic death in the hour of victory. 

Mr. Fortescup's design is to write, in four 
volumes of about six hundred pages each, the 
history of the British Army down to the year 
1870. The two volumes now ready carry the 
story down to the Peace of Paris in 1763, and 
the two forthcoming volumes will bring it 
forward to the great reforms which virtually 
closed the life of the old Army and opened 
that of the new. The common assumption, as 
Mr. Fortescue notes, that the history of the 
Army begins with the 14th of February, 1661, 
is inaccurate, since the continuity of the ex- 
istence of the Coldstream Guards, a regiment 
of the New Model, was practically unbroken 
by the ceremony of Saint Valentine's day. 
This famous corps therefore forms a link which 
binds the New Model army of the Long Par- 
liament to the army of Queen Victoria. But 
as the very name New Model indicates that 
there was an earlier and older model, the his- 
torian of the Army is not justified in begin- 
ning with the Long Parliament's Ordinance of 
Feb. 15, 1645, but is thrown back to the out- 
break of the Civil War. It is found that at 
that period King and Parliament had avail- 
able for purposes of military organization a 
body of trained and experienced officers who 
had learnt their trade abroad, and mainly in 
the Low Countries. The historian is thus led 
back to the Thirty Years' War, to the tens and 
even hundreds of thousands of English and 
Scots who fought for pay and Protestantism 
under Gustavus and Maurice of Nassau. But, 
having gone back two generations before the 
Civil War for the germ of the New Model, it is 
found to be impossible to pause there. For in

the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign we are con- 
fronted with an important period in English 
military history, with a break in old traditions, 
with concessions to foreign ideas and adoption 
of foreign practices albeit such concessions 
were then as always distasteful to the nation: 
"For there were memories to which the English 
clung with pathetic tenacity, not in Elizabeth's day 
only but even to the midst of the Civil War, the mem- 
ories of King Harry the Fifth, of the Black Prince, of 
Edward the Third, and of the unconquerable infantry 
that had won the day at Agincourt, Pontiers, and Crec.y. 
The passion of English sentiment over the change is 
mirrored to us for all time in the pages of Shakespeare; 
for no nation loves military reform so little as our own, 
and we shrink from the thought that if military glory is 
not to pass from a possession into a legend, it must be 
eternally renewed with strange weapons and by unfa- 
miliar methods. This was the trouble which afflicted 
England under the Tudors, and she comforted herself 
with the immortal prejudice that is still her main-stay 
in all times of doubt, 

1 1 tell thee, herald, 

I thought upon one pair of English legs 

Did march Three Frenchmen. ' " 

This " immortal prejudice " is proving just 
now anything but a u mainstay," and seems at 
last in a fair way of extinction. 

The origin of England's Elizabethan new 
departures in warfare are to be traced back by 
the historian through the Spaniards, the Lands- 
knechts, and the Swiss, and the old English 
practice and tradition must be followed to its 
source. It is not found at Cre$y, for Edward 
III.'s time was one of military reform. Revert- 
ing to the Battle of Falkirk, the Statute of 
Winchester, the Assize of Arms, the essentially 
English tradition still recedes, till at last at 
the Conquest we can discern a great English 
principle which forced itself on the conquering 
Normans, and eventually on all Europe 
namely, the rule that all men-at-arms must dis- 
mount when in action and as a preparatory 
step for action. The primitive national army 
of Teutonic England consisted of the mass of 
free landowners between the ages of sixteen 
and sixty, and was known as the fyrd. Custom 
fixed its term of service at two months in the 
year. Alfred reorganized this force of Land- 
wehr by dividing the country into military dis- 
tricts, and requiring every five hides of land, 
at the king's summons, to furnish, maintain, 
and pay an armed man. Each owner of five 
hides of land was furthermore required to do 
thane's service, that is, to appear in the field 
heavily armed and to serve throughout the 
campaign. Canute later added a new and more 
distinctly military element in the form of a 
royal body-guard, originally a picked force of 



from three to six thousand Danish troops, 
known as the house-carles. 

" It was with an army framed on this model the 
raw levies of the fyrd and the better trained men of the 
body-guard that King Harold, flushed with the vic- 
tory of Stamford Bridge, marched down to meet the 
invasion of William of Normandy. . . . Yet the force 
was homogenous in virtue of a single custom wherein 
lies the secret of the rise of England's prowess as a 
military nation. Though the wealthy thanes might 
ride horses on the march, they dismounted one and all 
for action, and fought, even to the king himself, on their 
own feet." 

Mr. Fortescue's opening chapters, then, are 
devoted to a sketch of the growth of England's 
military power to the time of its first manifesta- 
tion at Cre$y, and thence to Agincourt ; then 
through its decay under the blight of the Wars 
of the Roses to its revival under the Tudors, 
and to the training of English contingents and 
adventurers under foreign schools and in for- 
eign wars which prepared the way for the New 
Model and the Standing Army. The six hun- 
dred years of English military history from 
Hastings to Naseby have been compressed into 
some two hundred pages, all details being 
omitted save those essential to a coherent ac- 
count of the growth of the national military 
system. The New Model army was voted in 
February, 1645 ; and with the opening chapter 
of Book III., which nearly completes the first 
half of Vol. I., the author proceeds to give an 
interesting and somewhat detailed account of 
the organization of this famous body and its 
exploits in the field. Mr. Fortescue has some- 
thing to say of the common tendency to regard 
the New Model army as primarily a body of 
zealots whose religious enthusiasm made them 
irresistible in battle, without taking into ac- 
count the vital fact that they were disciplined 
soldiers trained under a military code of almost 
unexampled severity. 

" Cromwell's system is generally summed up in the 
word fanaticism; but this is less than half the truth. 
. . . Simple fanaticism is in its nature undisciplined; it 
is strong because it assumes its superiority, it is weak 
because it is content with the assumption; only when 
bound under a yoke such as that of a Zizka or of a 
Cromwell is it irresistible. Cromwell's great work was 
the same as Zizka's, to subject the fanaticism that he 
saw around him to discipline. He did not go out of his 
way to find fanatics. ' Sir,' he once wrote, ' the State in 
choosing men for its service takes no notice of their 
opinions; if they be willing to faithfully serve it, that

undoubtedly selected men of good character, just as any 
colonel would endeavor to do to-day. But Fairfax's was 
by no means an army of saints. One regiment of the 
New Model mutinied when its colonel opened his com- 
mand with a sermon. It is time to have done with all 
misconceptions as to the work that Cromwell did for

the military service of England, for it is summed up in 
the one word discipline. It was the work not of a 
preacher hut of a soldier." 

In fact, the contempt with which the Royalist 
soldiers came latterly to be regarded by the 
Parliamentarians seems to have savored rather 
of professional than spiritual pride. The king's 
troopers were despised not so much as profane 
and loose-living " malignants," as ill-furnished 
and ill-disciplined soldiers. This is indicated 
in the satirical accounts in the Parliamentary 
newspapers of the prisoners captured at Bristol, 
one of which says : 

" First came half-a-dozen of carbines in their leathern 
coats and starved weather-beaten jades, just like so 
many brewers in their jerkins made of old boots, riding 
to fetch in old casks; and after them as many light horse- 
men with great saddles and old broken pistols, and 
scarce a sword among them, just like so many fiddlers 
with their fiddles in cases by their horses' sides. . . . 
In the works at Bristol was a company of footmen with 
knapsacks and half-pikes, like so many tinkers with 
budgets at their backs, and some musketeers with ban- 
doliers about their necks like a company of sow-gelders." 

The two chapters comprising Book IV. of 
Mr. Fortescue's opening volume recount briefly 
the military events of the unsettled and transi- 
tional period between the Restoration and the 
accession of William of Orange ; and the clos- 
ing half of the volume is occupied mainly with 
reforms and campaigns of Marlborough's time. 
The Anglo-French struggle for empire in India 
and the New World forms the central theme of 
Volume II. 

Mr. Fortescue's valuable work will be read 
with avidity by English military men, and his- 
torical students generally will find it a most 
convenient repository of the special class of 
facts it deals with. Ample references to the 
authorities consulted are given, for the most 
part at the foot of the page. The volumes are 
elegantly and substantially made, and are pro- 
vided with the necessary maps and plans.

DEAN MERIVALE.* 

Writing in a playful mood to his sister, in 
the year 1851, Dean Merivale charged Louis 
Napoleon with bribing one of Spottiswoode's 
printers for the advance sheets of the third 
volume of " The History of the Romans under 
the Empire "; and accused him farther of turn- 
ing to account, in planning his own coup d'etat,

from his Correspondence. Edited by his Daughter, Judith 
Anne Merivale. With a Portrait. London : Edward Arnold. 



the fourth chapter of that volume, wherein a 
somewhat similar movement on the part of 
Octavius is described. The letter also ex- 
pressed the confident hope that the Emperor 
would order a thousand copies of the " His- 
tory " for his regimental libraries, and would 
bestow upon its author the Cross of the Legion 
of Honor. Curiously enough, this bit of pleas- 
antry was taken by some in serious earnest 
which perhaps may go to prove the high repute 
enjoyed by the book in question from its first 
appearance. That the gap between Dr. Ar- 
nold's unfinished work and Gibbon's " Decline 
and Fall " had been filled by a worthy successor 
to those great historians, seems to have been 
very generally acknowledged. 

The main events in Dean Merivale's life 
may be briefly stated. Born in London in 
1808, he was educated at Harrow and Cam- 
bridge ; held a fellowship at that university 
from 1833 to 1848 ; was settled over the parish 
of Lawford from 1848 to 1869 ; and was then 
appointed dean of Ely, a post which he held 
until his death in 1893. In his youth the offer 
of a writership in India led to his spending 
eighteen months of his school life at Hailey- 
bury, preparing for the civil service examina- 
tions and studying Bengali, Hindustanee, Per- 
sian, political economy (under Malthus), and 
general history ; but he and his family then 
wisely decided that he should follow his inclina- 
tion for a life of letters, and soon afterward he 
entered St. John's College, Cambridge. 

The recent " Autobiography " by the Dean's 
daughter closes with the attainment of the fel- 
lowship at St. John's, the remaining two-thirds 
of the volume being devoted to correspondence. 
The whole forms a good record of a life filled 
with high aims steadily and successfully pur- 
sued from the beginning. It is worthy of note 
that when Charles Merivale was but six years 
old he took delight in playing with his brother 
Herman, aged seven, a game which they called 
" Roman history." It was played in Queen's 
Square, the northern end of which they named 
"Italy," and the northeast corner "Rome." 
The trundling of hoops was a leading feature 
of the game, the career of each consul being 
typified by the course which the player's hoop 
chanced to take. " The straight line of pub- 
lic virture was the narrow path of the kerb- 
stone, and few magistrates kept it to the end." 
In his school days at Harrow the future his- 
torian of the Roman Empire committed to 
memory, for his own amusement, all but a few 
hundred lines of Lucan's "Pharsalia," when 



1900.]

his sudden removal to Haileybury interrupted 
the task. 

That largeness of view and generosity of 
sentiment which characterize Merivale's writ- 
ings may, it seems not improbably, be largely 
owing to the variety of scene and of personal 
intercourse which he enjoyed in his youth. His 
paternal grandparents were dissenters, Presby- 
terians of pronounced Unitarian convictions; 
and there is something admirable in honest 
John Merivale's sturdy refusal to enter the 
Ministry or, indeed, to embrace any profes- 
sion, even when an uncle's fortune was offered 
him as an inducement. He preferred to be 
left to his books and his flute. On his moth- 
er's side Merivale's family was more orthodox, 
but the boy was free to follow his own inclina- 
tion in matters of religion, and he went to hear 
Dr. Belsham in Essex Street fully as often as 
to Dr. Martin's church in Queen's Square. 
The liberality of his faith is well expressed in 
this sentence from his pen : 

" I am well pleased to have had the opportunity of 
testing by my own observation how slight, how shadowy, 
is the pretended difference between the Episcopalian 
and the Presbyterian as such; and how little even far 
wider divergence in speculative opinion on points of 
dogma may affect the graces of the true Christian 
character." 

The names of those eminent men with whom 
Dean Merivale was more or less intimately 
acquainted would make a long list. In his 
college days we find him enjoying the society 
of the Tennysons and the Wordsworths 
Charles and Christopher, of Trench, Kem- 
ble, Milnes, Hallam, William Bodham Donne, 
William Hepworth Thompson, Arthur Helps, 
and many more besides. He had the honor of 
reciting Tennyson's prize poem, " Timbuctoo," 
at the request of the young poet, who was " too 
shy or too proud to exhibit himself on such an 
occasion." His letters to and from and about 
persons of whom one likes to hear, are well 
worth reading. The genesis and growth of 
the " History of the Romans, " so far as re- 
corded in these letters, lend them an additional 
interest. Genial humor pervades both the au- 
tobiography and the correspondence. (Among 
his other virtues the Dean's epitaph credits 
him with having been " caustic in wit, " as if 
causticity were likewise a virtue.) In a letter 
to Christopher Wordsworth he refers to Lem- 
priere as 

"A man of the highest imagination, which by a pe- 
culiar idiosyncrasy fell into an alphabetical form, in 
which the advantage of reference is more than counter- 
balanced by the constant dislocation of continuity. He 



was an index-maker of a higher order of beings, a 
vocabulist of the moon, of which he could probably 
have written a most veritable and entertaining history, 
including all the scandal about her paramour, the man 
in the moon." 

The chief fault of the " autobiography " is 
its brevity : it ends abruptly, although design- 
edly, at the most interesting period of the 
writer's life. A less generous selection from 
his letters, on the other hand, might have 
proved equally acceptable to the general reader. 
The care with which Miss Merivale has edited 
the volume is apparent perhaps almost pain- 
fully so in the abundant foot-notes, which 
deal with matters even of the minutest detail. 
On the very first page, however, an error 
probably a misprint has crept into one of 
these notes and assigned a wrong date as the 
year of Merivale's birth. 

Two short passages, culled at random from 
this book in closing, will give a glimpse of 
Dean Merivale's conservatism on the subject 
of education and on the " woman question." 
The first is from the "autobiography." 

" It is sad, and perhaps perplexing, to think that there 
should be no room at the University for combining 
the old-world studies with modern accomplishments; 
but so experience seems to teach us; and if a choice is 
to be allowed between the two, as is the tendency of the 
present day, I would say from my own observation, by 
all means stick to the Old in preference to the New. 
There is no training, I feel sure, equal to that of clas- 
sics and mathematics." 

It should be noted that the above was written 
at least twenty years ago. The next passage 
is from a letter written by Merivale to his sister 
Louisa in 1866. 

" About the comparative opportunities of men and 
women I have this to observe. Looking in the sphere 
of literary occupation most appropriate to the male 
genius, men have the advantage. In matters of wide 
research which lead to and require large inductions, 
men have the advantage not from education and oppor- 
tunities only, but from the natural structure of their 
minds. With the same advantages few, if any, women 
could compete with them. No woman could have 
written the histories of Tacitus or Gibbon, with the 
highest university education and the run of the Bodleian. 
On the other hand, there are other matters in which 
women are unrivaled, from their tact and observation of 
character and clearness of view generally in a narrow 
compass ; and for these you have fair opportunities. "

A NEW BJBLICAL, ENCYCLOPAEDIA.* 

These closing years of the nineteenth cen- 
tury are full of promise for students of the 
sacred Scriptures. The appearance within two 
successive years of the initial volumes of two 
great four-volume Dictionaries of the Bible, 
marks an era in biblical study and research. 
These two comprehensive works place in the 
hands of Bible students, in concise and clear 
form, the best results of all previous critical 
study in this line. They promise to be small 
libraries on all the essential and interesting 
questions of biblical criticism and interpreta- 
tion. And both are edited and issued by en- 
ergetic and aggressive Britons, Hastings' 
" Dictionary of the Bible " in Edinburgh (T. 
& T. Clark), and Cheyne's in London (A. & 
C. Black). 

The raison d'etre of the issuance simultane- 
ously of two such works is found in the fact 
that critically they occupy practically different 
positions. While Hastings' work is progres- 
sive, Cheyne's is described in the Preface in 
the following terms (p. ix.) : 

" The sympathies of the editors are, upon the whole, 
with what is commonly known as ' advanced ' criticism, 
not simply because it is advanced, but because such a 
criticism, in the hands of a circumspect and experienced 
scholar, takes account of facts and phenomena which 
the criticism of a former generation overlooked or 
treated superficially. They have no desire, however, 
to ' boycott ' moderate criticism, when applied by a 
critic who, either in the form or in the substance of his 
criticism, has something original to say." 

The Preface is devoted largely to a eulogy 
upon the late Professor W. Robertson Smith, 
editor of the ninth edition of the " Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica," to whom credit is given for 
the origination, twelve years ago, of the plan 
according to which this work has been executed. 
Some of the best contributions of Professor 
Smith to the Britannica have been brought 
down to date and embodied in this work. 
Other material prepared by him has also been 
used so far as consistent with latest research. 

The chief features of this work, in addition 
to its " advanced " critical position, are : (1) 
the presentation in full, under each word, of 
readings of the Versions, extending in the case 
of the Septuagint, to several of the most im- 
portant MSS.; (2) larger emphasis upon the

Geography, and Natural History, of the Bible. Edited by

Old than upon the New Testament, especially in 
the lines of textual criticism and biblical archae- 
ology ; (3) the omission of articles which treat 
of biblical theology proper, based on the state- 
ment that we are not as yet sufficiently ad- 
vanced in some other lines of research to 
venture on this field. The emphasis of the 
philological, the technical, and purely critical 
treatment of the themes is everywhere appar- 
ent. Every proper name in the Old and New 
Testament and the Old Testament Apocrypha 
is discussed with as much fulness as the data 
allow. 

The purely scientific and scholarly character 
of the work has brought along with it a for- 
midable array of abbreviations, symbols, and 
bibliographical notes. These together with 
their explanations cover nine double-columned 
pages, and are an enormous space-saving de- 
vice, though they may be a hardship on the 
reader until he has made himself their master. 

This first volume has a distinguished roll of 
fifty-three contributors. Of these thirty-two 
are British, fifteen are German, Dutch, and 
Swiss, and six are Americans. We find in 
the whole number twenty-two men in the Old 
Testament department, including all the six 
Americans, and only six in the New Testament, 
and of these latter four are Germans. The 
heaviest contributor is, of course, Professor 
Cheyne, the editor-in-chief, whose reputation 
is a guarantee for critical and scientific re- 
search. Prof. George Adam Smith's service is 
especially noteworthy in articles on the biblical 
geography of Palestine. Some of the most 
conspicuous articles in this volume are " Apoc- 
alyptic Literature" by Professor R. H. Charles, 
" Apocrypha " by M. R. James, " Assyria " 
and "Babylonia" by L. W. King, of the 
British Museum, " Canon " by Karl Budde, 
" Canticles " by the Editor, " Chronology " by 
Karl Marti and H. von Soden, " The Book of 
Daniel " by A. Kamphausen, and " Deuter- 
onomy " by George F. Moore. Upon an exam- 
ination of the articles we find that the editors 
have stood by their principle announced in the 
Preface, though there is not everywhere, as 
might, of course, be expected, full agreement 
on critical questions. Professor Cheyne is 
quite in the van on most points, while a goodly 
number of his contributors are not far behind 
him. Together they give us in this volume the 
fin de siecle position of the advanced school, 
if such it may be called, of biblical criticism. 
As the pronouncement of this school it is the 
best up-to-date compendium, and for many

other purposes will be of real service to biblical 
scholars. 

The arrangement of the matter is admirable. 
The heading of each article is in full-face Clar- 
endon type, and if it is long, it is subdivided 
into sections, and the section-theme is inset in 
dark-faced type. This plan, and a method of 
cross-references from one article to a given 
section of another where the same theme is 
treated, is both a space- saving device and an 
invaluable convenience to the user. The clean, 
clear type, and the use of different sizes for 
matters of minor importance, and a small type 
for notes, make up a solid, substantial, yet 
inviting page to the careful student of biblical 
problems. IRA M> PKICE> 



BUILDING THE SHIP OF STATE.* 

The proposition, novel not many decades 
ago, has come to be accepted as axiomatic, 
that the written Constitutions of America are 
the result of a process of gradual development ; 
and now it is the details of that process which 
largely engage the attention of constitutional 
students. Landon, Taylor, Stevens, and Coxe 
have shown the origin of many of the funda- 
mental principles of our system; Dicey and 
Macy have explained how principles of iden- 
tical origin have experienced distinctive evo- 
lutions in the politics of Britain and America ; 
and Fisher has traced the American appli- 
cations of these principles, through their 
several stages of use in the charters and con- 
stitutions of various colonies, to their present 
accepted form. The terse and succinct provis- 
ions of the United States Constitution, permit- 
ting an elastic application to changing condi- 
tions and varying necessities, have proved fa- 
vorable also to disputes concerning its proper 
construction. What did the framers of that 
instrument intend? is a question frequently 
asked, and often with much pertinence. The 
recently published essay on " The Growth of 
the Constitution in the Federal Convention," 
by Mr. William M. Meigs, contributes to the 
subject of constitutional evolution, by throwing 
light upon the extent of the application of par- 
ticular principles which was in the minds of the 
Framers. Knowing the objects at which they 
were aiming, and the reasons why certain forms

CONVENTION OF 1787. By William M. Meigs. Philadelphia :

of expression were selected, we can understand 
better the scope of the changes in our govern- 
ment which followed the adoption of the work 
of that convention. Mr. Meigs has furnished 
a convenient summary, clause by clause, of the 
debates waged in the convention and the action 
finally taken. "Elliott's Debates" of course 
show all this ; but Mr. Meigs has summarized 
these "Debates" topically; and with him we 
can, without personal delving, follow from week 
to week, the presentation of diverse views on 
the same subject, and often trace the changes of 
sentiment leading to the unanimous selection 
of propositions which had previously been seri- 
ously questioned in debate. 

To illustrate fully Mr. Meigs's method would 
be to repeat pages of his book. It will serve 
as an instance, to refer to the subjects of " laws 
impairing the obligation of contracts," and 
"ex post facto laws," the prohibitions concern- 
ing which were presented for consideration 
late in the deliberations of the convention ; and 
per contra, to the proposition which was pre- 
sented but rejected, to apply the "obligation 
clause " to congressional legislation. The de- 
bates disclose a growth of opinion on these 
and other subjects, in the convention. 

An important feature of this work is a fac- 
simile copy of Randolph's draft, in his own 
hand, of a proposed constitution, with notes and 
additions by Rutledge. Both the original draft 
and the emendations are shown to have been 
made while the convention was sitting ; and 
they throw light of their own upon the devel- 
opment of opinion among the delegates. 

Mr. Meigs's Index is brief and simple, as 
he thought an exhaustive one unnecessary ; so 
he has indexed the names of eleven only of the 
delegates. But the present reviewer believes 
that many readers would liberally use an index 
in which the name of every debater in the con- 
vention should be given, and referring to every 
page where his share in the deliberations ap- 
pears. JAMES OSCAR PIERCE. 



THE " Philobiblon " of Richard de Bury has long held

fact that in this country at least the chronicles of this 
quaint old bibliomaniac have hitherto been practically 
inaccessible to the general book-buyer. Messrs. Meyer 
Brothers & Co. are therefore to be heartily thanked 
for issuing the work in handsome and inexpensive 
form, as the first volume in a projected series of book

RECENT BOOKS OF TRAVEL,.* 



That redoubtable and indefatigable traveller and 
writer, Mrs. Bird-Bishop, has been touring up the 
Yangzte Valley for " recreation and interest " only, 
but on returning has presented us with two large 
volumes, entitled " The Yangtze Valley and Be- 
yond," packed with geographical, commercial, po- 
litical, and religious information, and well provided 
with map and illustrations and appendices. Mrs. 
Bishop, for the most part alone save for a few na- 
tives, traversed twelve hundred miles in regions 
little visited by Europeans, and in large part un- 
noticed in travel literature. The hardships she 
endured from the curious crowds she thus describes. 

" I sat in my chair in the village street the unwilling 
center of a large and very dirty crowd, which had 
leisure to stand around me for an hour, staring, making 
remarks, laughing at my peculiarities, pressing closer 
and closer till there was hardly air to breathe, taking 
out my hair pins, and passing my gloves round and put- 
ting them on their dirty hands, and on two occasions 
abstracting my spoon and slipping it into their sleeves, 
being in no way abashed when they were detected. . . . 
The crowd which always gathered during my passage 
down the street rolled in at the doorway, blocking up 
the yard, shouting, often times hooting, and fighting each 
other for a look at the foreigner. Fortunately, doors in 
Chinese inns have strong wooden bolts, and when my 
baggage and I were once ensconced I was secure from 
intrusion, unless a few men and boys ran on ahead to 
take possession of the room before I entered it, or 
forced themselves in behind Be-dien when he brought 
in my dinner. If it were merely a boarded wall, a row 
of patient eyes usually watched me for an hour, and 
with much gratification, for these rooms are dark with 
the door shut, and my candle revealed my barbarian 
proceedings. But worse than this was the slow scraping 
of holes in the plaster partition, when there was one,

peculiarly irritating sound of whispering, and eventu-

Mrs. Bishop's chapters on Chinese Charities, on 
Protestant Missions, and on Opium, and the Intro- 
ductory and Concluding chapters, show large and 
judicious views founded on full knowledge ; and 
the work as a whole is an extremely sane contribu- 
tion to books on China, giving us a definite and 
reliable impression of the most populous river valley 
on the globe, and a glimpse of the Tibetan border 
land beyond. 

" In Dwarf Land and Cannibal Country," by A. B. 
Lloyd, is a record by an enterprising young En- 
glish missionary of a journey across Central Africa 
by the Uganda-Congo route, and includes some 
notes of residence in Uganda and Toro. The title 
is quite misleading, as " Dwarf Land " and " Can- 
nibal Country " play but a small part in these pages. 
The first seven chapters might well be compressed 
into one ; but from Chapter VIII. on the book is 
concisely written and of decided interest as well as 
of considerable value. The author has many ad- 
ventures with wild beasts and men, which he nar- 
rates modestly and well, in some of which a bicycle 
figures prominently. 

" A bicycle which had been sent to me during my 
stay in Uganda was constantly used by me in taking 
my journeys abroad, and often I have had most exciting 
times when on the wheel. One morning I started off 
to visit a village some few miles away from the mission 
station. The road was well cultivated and about 5 feet 
wide. It was, in fact, the main road leading to Uganda. 
I had reached the top of a long hill, and on the other 
side was a gentle slope into the valley beyond ; I knew 
the road well, having often passed that way, and I 
therefore prepared myself for a ' coast.' Near the 
foot of the hill was a slight turn in the road, and as I 
approached it I put my feet again on the pedals. I 
was going at a great speed, and as I rounded the cor- 
ner an awful sight met my gaze; not twenty yards in 
front there lay in the centre of the path a huge lion, 
with head down upon his paws, facing the direction 
from which I was coming. It was impossible for me 
to stop the machine, the speed was too great. To the 
left of the path was a high wall of rock towering some 
twenty feet above my head; on the right was a steep 
incline down, down, down, for 100 feet to a river. I 
had scarcely a second to take in the situation, and to 
make up my mind as to what course of action to pursue. 
It was a critical moment. What could I do ? To turn to 
the right down the steep incline would have meant almost 
certain destruction; to attempt to stop, even if success- 
ful, would have meant pulling up at the entrance to the 
jaws of the King of the Forest. I therefore did the 
only thing that was possible, I rang my bell, and 
shouted at the top of my voice, then let the bike ' go 
at its topmost speed. As I shot into view, the lion 
raised his huge shaggy head, and seeing this unearthly 
creature come racing towards him making so strange a 
cry, lifted up his voice and gave forth a most blood- 
curdling yelp. The apparition was too much even for 
him, and when I was about five yards from him he 
leapt onto the right side of the path, and I had just

room to scramble past him. Once beyond, I pedalled 
away as I never had before, not even looking round to 
see what next happened to the startled lion. But such 
an experience, if it happen once, is quite enough, and I 
learned the lesson not to ' scorch,' even in Africa, where 
there are no policemen." 

He traverses the great primeval forest and catches 
sight of pigmies, and has some intercourse with 
them, and on his way down the Aruwimi River he 
has some adventures with cannibals, perhaps the 
finest race of men he met. 

" Sometimes one would see part of a limb roasting 
over the fire, or else in a cooking pot, boiling, while the 
warriors sat around watching eagerly until it was cooked. 
But still, notwithstanding the fact of there being a 
superstitious idea in connection with this cannibalism, 
there is no doubt a depraved appetite. I have seen 
the wild, exciting feast, where spirit dances and invo- 
cations have been the principal items, and I have seen 
the warriors in all soberness sit down to a 'joint of 
man ' in exactly the same way as they would do to a 
piece of forest antelope." 

The book is well illustrated and has useful maps.

first half of a journey made in 1894 through un- 
known parts of Western China and Eastern Thibet, 
and contains interesting accounts of adventures 
with savage beasts and men. He thus describes a 
curious custom of the Su-Chu natives : 

" On our arrival we discovered that we had come at 
a most inauspicious time of the year in which to hope 
to secure hospitable entertainment, as the native popu- 
lation was given up to the enormous undertaking of 
washing the bones of their ancestors. When we first 
saw this operation it struck us as being remarkably 
funny; but it is an exceedingly serious matter to the 
natives themselves, and is a custom pretty generally 
existing among the tribes of Western China and Thibet. 
For many centuries it has been an established rule 
among them once a year to exhume the bones of their 
ancestors and wash them. This annual washing usually 
lasts for a period of two or three weeks, or even a 
month, and is a function attended with much ceremo- 
nious pomp and religious devotion. Huge pots of water 
are placed beside the graves, and one by one the bones 
are taken out, and carefully scoured, and then tenderly 
consigned to their resting-place once more. These 
bones are also looked upon as having a high market- 
value, it being considered a mark of great esteem among 
the members of the tribe to be the proud possessor of 
the largest ' bonery,' so that the trading and bartering 
of them for other objects forms a considerable industry. 
They are frequently seized upon by creditors for debt, 
when at once the unfortunate debtor is shunned by the 
rest of the tribe, and is suffered to remain in disgrace 
until he shall have redeemed them." 

Mr. Reid claims to have been the first to explore 
the remains of an ancient civilization near Hissik 
Karpo, Thibet, but his report is very meagre. The 
author's style is simple, direct, and forcible, though 
we miss the romantic touch which gives glamour to 
travels. The work is furnished with a number of 
illustrations and several maps. 



" The Real Malay," by Sir F. A. Swettenham, 
is an intimate study by a British resident of native 
life in the Malay Peninsula. The atmosphere and 
color of the semi-barbaric country are well depicted. 
We have a series of realistic etchings of the land 
and its inhabitants, animal and human, and the 
episodes are clearly and vividly drawn. He thus 
remarks on the difficulty of understanding the Ori- 
ental character, and on the lack of individuality in 
the inhabitants of the Far East. 

" One who is the outcome of Western civilization and 
Christian teaching, could hardly expect to understand 
the peculiarities of an Eastern character, the product 
of generations of Muhammadan or Hindu ancestors. 
But if you live in the East for years if you make 
yourself perfectly familiar with the language, litera- 
ture, customs, prejudices, and superstitions of the peo- 
ple; if you lie on the same floor with them, eat out of 
the same dish, fight with them and against them, join 
in their sorrows and their joys, and at last win their 
regard then the reading of their characters is no 
longer an impossible task, and you will find that be- 
tween one Eastern and another there is a much greater 
similarity than there is between two Westerns, even 
though they be of the same nationality. There are 
good and bad, energetic and lazy, but you will hardly 
ever meet those complex products of Western civiliza- 
tion whose characters are subordinated to the state of 
their nerves, and those to the season of the year, the 
surroundings of the moment, politics, the money market, 
and a thousand things of which the Eastern is blissfully 
unconscious." 

The introductory chapter on the English method of 
expansion in the Peninsula ought to be of interest 
to Americans. The book has no map, illustrations, 
or index. 

The latest book from the prolific pen of the late 
Mr. G. W. Steevens is entitled " In India." In 
this volume he writes with his usual vigor and as- 
surance, and gives in his brisk and vivid way an 
impressionist sketch of India, political, social, and 
industrial. Mr. Steevens draws often with too hard 
and heavy a stroke ; however in this picture of ele- 
phant travel we see him at his best : 

" The elephant knows. When the mahout wants to 
get on her neck, she takes him on her trunk and bends 
it till he can walk up her forehead. When you want 
to get on to her back, she lets down a hind-foot to 
make one step, and curls up her tail to make another. 
She knows that a branch she can walk under will sweep 
you off her back; therefore she goes round, or, if that 
is not possible, pushes down the tree with her trunk as 
gently as you put down a teacup. At every ford she 
tries the bottom, at every bridge she tries the planks: 
she knows better than you do how much she weighs and 
what will bear her. Jerk, jerk, jerk she see-saws 
you at every step, for you are sitting on a blanket just 
atop of her shoulder. Now and again the mahout ad- 
dresses her in a language, banded down from father to 
children, that only mahouts and elephants understand, 
or smites her over the head with a heavy, iron-hooked 
ankus. It falls with a dull thud on her hairy forehead; 
it would crack your skull like an egg-shell, but it hurts 
the elephant as a dead leaf would hurt you. Behind 
her ear you see a crevasse of raw flesh in the armour-

plating of hide: that wound is kept open, and through 
it only can she be made to feel. She just tramples on, 
now tilted almost onto her head, now all but standing 
on her tail; over the shallow rivers, along the rutted 
cart- tracks, till the sun begins to bake and the line of 
hills in front changes from a wash of blue to a clearcut 
saw-edge of shaded greens and browns." 

Mr. John W. Bookwalter, in " Siberia and Cen- 
tral Asia," gives us some modest letters of travel 
profusely illustrated from admirable photographs. 
He journeys into Siberia as far as Tomsk by the 
Trans-Siberian Railway, and into Central Asia as 
far as Samarkand by the Trans-Caspian railway. 

" Great as will be the effect upon the world of the 
opening of the Trans-Siberian railway system a fact 
that is generally recognized, the Trans-Caspian rail- 
way system, when completed, will be productive of re- 
sults even far more important in their political and 
commercial consequences. There is a branch of the 
Trans-Caspian railway now completed, some 250 miles 
in .length and running southward to Mervand to Kushk, 
on the very borders of Afghanistan. It is being quietly 
extended to Herat, and it will, when completed, give 
Russia practical control of Northwestern Afghanistan, 
as Herat is the key to that country. These lines, when 
in operation, will thus obviously give Russia a control- 
ing influence in Persia and Northwestern Afghanistan. 
A branch also of the main stem of the Trans-Caspian 
line is being built from Samarkand through Ferghan, 
in the direction of Kokand and Kashgar, in the Pamirs, 
almost in sight of the northern border of India. This 
line in time will, no doubt, be extended into Chinese 
Turkestan, and perhaps into the very center of China 
itself, bringing thus this great and populous country 
into communication with Europe, even more directly 
than by the way of the Trans-Siberian railway line." 

The author gives a very glowing account of the de- 
velopment of Northern and Central Asia under Rus- 
sian auspices, and the account seems as accurate as 
we ought to expect from the passing traveller. 

" Two Years in Palestine and Syria," by Mar- 
garet Thomas, is a fresh and pleasantly written de- 
scription, to which the colored illustrations add 
much embellishment. The account of Jerusalem 
and its environs is specially full and good. 

" Jerusalem has neither street lamps, policemen, post- 
men, nor newspapers; people who go out at night are 
ordered to carry lanterns under a heavy penalty. The 
keeping of three successive Sundays Mohammedan, 
Jewish, Christian leads to much loss of time, for the 
lazily-disposed observe all three. . . . Night in the 
Holy Land is a thing to be remembered. The air is 
soft and balmy, neither hot nor cold ; ' the sun, setting 
like a globe of amber, tinges the top of the blue vapor 
which ever hangs over the Moabite Mountains and Dead 
Sea with iridiscent tints. The sky is literally powdered 
with stars, not gleaming as they do on a frosty night in 
the North, but soft and dreamy." 

" The American in Holland," by the Rev. W. E. 
Griffis, is a fairly readable description of various 
trips in all parts of the Netherlands. He visits 
American friends who have spent years in Holland, 
living at the Hague in winter and in summer at 
Nunspeet " or some other rural paradise." He is 
in love with Dutch civilization. It is delightful to 



his eyes " to find no spoiling of scenery by advertise- 
ments. The study of the people of beauty as a per- 
manent force to life is commendable. The country 
in general induces a spirit of quiet restfulness so 
grateful to the overwrought American." American 
Colonies in Holland may yet he fashionable. His- 
torical associations are enlarged upon, and there is 
an account of the inauguration of Queen Wilhel- 
mina, to which the author was an American dele- 
gate. Mr. Griffis is genial and almost fulsome in 
his appreciation of the land and people. Though 
rather slight and superficial, this volume will serve 
as a popular and pleasant book, and the illustrations 
are of interest. 

" Peaks and Pines," by Mr. J. H. Lees, is a jolly 
narrative of a summer's sport in Norway with rod 
and gun. The book is entertaining and instructive, 
closing with some practical directions which will be 
useful to sportsmen everywhere. 

"By -Gone Tourist Days," by Miss Laura G. Col- 
lins, is a sprightly series of familiar, sometimes rather 
too familiar, letters of travel, mostly from contin- 
ental Europe. The black-letter printing of this book 
is very refreshing to the eye. There is no excuse 
for the iniquity of thin type on highly glazed paper, 
for though illustrations may be on plate paper, they 
should be, as in this book, on separate pages, and 
so not interfere with a continuous text. 

" Mexican Vistas," by Mrs. H. W. Sherratt, is an 
agreeably written description of recent tours not 
personally conducted. The book has a number of 
clear illustrations and may be commended to the 
general reader and tourist. 

" Hawaii and its People," by Mr. A. S. Twombly, 
is a general description and historical account de- 
signed for younger readers and popular use. It is 
fairly illustrated and seems carefully prepared. 

"The Holy Land, from Landau, Saddle, and 
Palanquin," by Mr. W. B. Lent, is thoroughly re- 
ligious and biblical ; but the sentiment is often com- 
monplace and the description quite cursory. While 
the material might serve as letters to a religious 
paper, it is rather light for putting into book form.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Bismarck ^ r * J ames Wycliffe Headlam's new 

and hi* life of Bismarck (Putnam) adds a 

king thtorie*. somewhat belated volume to the 
" Heroes of the Nations " series. The delay has 
been well utilized, however, for this volume is a 
much more valuable monograph than is ordinarily 
furnished by the series. The history of Bismarck's 
earlier life, and of his labors in the formation of the 
German Empire, up to the close of the Franco- 
Prussian war, brings out nothing new, so that any 
criticism must occupy itself with the style rather 
than the matter of this portion. Briefly, the author 
has done his work exceedingly well. Bismarck's

THE DIAL

purposes, and the means by which they were exe- 
cuted, are stated simply and clearly, without any 
attempt at detailed analysis of diplomatic manoeu- 
vres, and notably without any wearisome effort at 
character painting. Yet the character of Bismarck 
is made manifest in his official acts and in the mo- 
tives which inspired them. The novelty of Mr. 
Headlam's work lies in his treatment of the career 
of Bismarck in his later labors as Chancellor of the 
German Empire, for here the author rejects in a 
measure the opinions held by Von Sybel and other 
authors and follows more nearly modern German 
criticism ; a criticism which is becoming more schol- 
arly as it becomes less contemporary. Bismarck's 
refusal to identify himself with any political party, 
and his constant shifting for support from one to 
another of the parties of the Reichstag, is attributed 
by the author to the earnest conviction that, as 
Chancellor, he could not become a party leader. 
To him the Emperor was still ruler " by grace of 
God," limited in some degree in the exercise of his 
kingly power, but still the centre and sun of all 
governmental activity. He, Bismarck, was merely 
the Emperor's representative, chosen personally by 
the Emperor, and not in any way responsible to the 
authority of votes. The wisdom or unwisdom of 
measures was, in the end, purely a matter for exec- 
utive decision, and freedom of decision could not 
be guaranteed if the Chancellor should ever become 
a party leader. Mr. Headlam maintains in fact 
that it was neither love of power, nor disdain of 
political parties, nor lack of principle that kept Bis- 
marck from adopting a partisan position, but pri- 
marily rather the desire to preserve for the mon- 
archy the right, always strongly manifested in the 
Prussian state, of exercising a controlling influence 
in legislation and in government. Possibly this is 
more didactically stated than is warranted by the 
author's language, but the impression is given, nev- 
ertheless, and as such, furnishes a clearer thread of 
central purpose for Bismarck's political activities 
than is customarily credited to him. The book con- 
tains many excellent illustrations and a map of 
Germany showing the changes made in 1866. 

The new method There has been of recent years a 
of teaching tendency to substitute the study of 

Economics. economic history, correlated with the 

general facts of political and social development, for 
the older-fashioned study of theoretical economics in 
our secondary schools. We have doubted the wis- 
dom of this tendency, for elementary economic the- 
ory has always seemed to us to offer an almost ideal 
form of mental discipline for young people from 
sixteen to twenty years of age. In the hands of 
the right sort of teachers it is equal in value to 
geometry, the mechanical section of physics, and 
the structural study of a foreign language. We 
have feared that the substitution in question might 
mean a substitution of mnemonic cram for enforced 
intellectual self-activity. But we are bound to say 
that this fear is almost dispelled in the presence of 



such a book as Mr. Henry W. Thurston's recent 
" Economics and Industrial History for Secondary 
Schools" (Scott, Foresman & Co.). There is no 
lack of facts in Mr. Thurston's presentation of the 
subject, but there is also no lack of stimulus for the 
best type .of intellectual exertion. The exercises 
planned by the author are so ingenious, and the 
questions he sets the students so searching, that it 
would be difficult to devise a more valuable disci- 
pline than a student would gain from the conscien- 
tious following of the plan of work here prescribed. 
It means, however, a good reference library to- 
gether with freedom in its use, an enthusiastic 
instructor, and a body of students willing to depart 
widely from their ordinary methods of learning 
school lessons. Given these conditions, we know of 
no other text book as good for its purpose as the 
one now before us. It is clear in its exposition, 
yet does not smooth away all the difficulties ; it pre- 
sents many facts of industrial history, yet does not 
preclude the necessity of digging out many more. 
It is, moreover, up to date, and based upon the best 
authorities. In fact, we are acquainted with no 
other elementary book which thus brings within the 
reach of beginners the conclusions of Seebohm and 
Cunningham, of Rogers and Ashley, of Weeden 
and Wright. The work has three parts. The first 
of these offers a series of inductive exercises in the 
economic life that surrounds us. The second and 
most considerable recounts the economic history of 
England and America. The third deals with the 
elements of economic theory, and for this the other 
two sections afford admirable preparation. We rec- 
ommend the book most cordially to all who are 
seeking this particular sort of solution of the prob- 
lem of teaching economics, while those who still 
adhere to the more orthodox method will at least 
find in the book a valuable adjunct to their work. 

" The Redemption of Africa," a 
rather ambitious work, in two vol- 

umes (p R Reyell Q ^ ig another 

one of the ripened fruits of the Chicago Congress 
of Religions in 1893, Mr. F. P. Noble, Secretary 
of the Congress on Africa, set before himself the 
task of preparing "A Story of Civilization" in 
Africa. The entire work is broken into three books. 
The first discusses "The Ancient and Mediaeval 
Preparation," the second " The Religious Partition," 
and the third book, " The Expansion of Missions." 
The author begins with Abraham's sojourn in the 
land of the Nile, and attempts to follow every re- 
ligious influence on that continent of any import- 
ance from that day down to modern times. The 
first book is the least satisfactory of all, especially 
in its earlier chapters, in that it involves too many 
assumptions. " The Religious Partition " is a well- 
considered and tersely-stated estimate of the part 
which each of the great religious bodies of the 
church has had in the evangelization of that dark 
continent. This estimate is based on the works of 
the best and most recent writers on the various

phases of the civilizing and evangelizing forces 
at work in Africa. The third book is a still 
hroader view of the whole question. It presents a 
condensed yet very readable description of the re- 
ligious and educational work carried on by all 
bodies of Christians among the negroes of the South 
and in the Antilles, and the part which they must 
take sooner or later in the evangelization of the 
home-land of their ancestors. The importance of 
educational, medical, and literary training is also 
emphasized by the results already achieved on these 
lines, particularly in South Africa. One of the 
most useful features of this work is the large body 
of maps, charts, and tables. The educational sta- 
tistics include colleges and universities, theolog- 
ical seminaries and training-schools, boarding and 
high schools, industrial and medical schools and 
kindergartens. The literary table presents the name 
of the language and the location where the whole 
or a part of the Bible is now in circulation ; also 
statistics of African languages and peoples possess- 
ing Bible-versions. Among the numerous remaining 
statistics we note especially the " Directory of Agen- 
cies for the Christianization of African Peoples in 
Africa, America, the Antilles, and Madagascar," 
the authorities used in the compilation of the work, 
also indexes of persons, places, societies, and sub- 
jects. This work is and for some time must be a 
valuable birds-eye view of all modern attempts to 
civilize and evangelize the untold millions of the 
Dark Continent. 

A Frenchman writing from personal 
French celebrities knowledge of Lamartine, George 

of fifty yean. ' 

band, Victor Hugo, Musset, Chopin, 
and others known to French letters, art, and politics, 
could hardly fail to be entertaining. In the volume 
entitled " The Literary Reminiscences of Edward 
Grenier " (Macmillan), translated by Mrs. Abel 
Bam, there is the glowing enthusiasm of one who 
remembers with a sort of reverent fidelity, the looks 
and accents of the deities of his youth. M. Grenier, 
has written with an easy abandon to the impres- 
sions that are now but memories, and very much of 
the fervor of his personal devotions or his personal 
dislike gives color to the pages. The ready gar- 
rulity that should flow without reserve in such 
reminiscences is natural to him, and the reader can 
not question either his veracity or his sincerity. 
M. Grenier had some successes as a poet himself, 
and the naivete with which he tells of them gives a 
piquant relish to his account of the doings and say- 
ings of others whose larger success gave him no 
rankling jealousy, but only the warm appreciation 
of a kindred spirit in love with art, humanity, and 
the world. A broad, genial charity sweetens every 
unpleasant incident to which his pen must make 
record, and the tone of intellectual and moral health 
and soundness is finely unmistakable. The pleasure 
with which he told Me'rime'e of Goethe's praise of 
him is charmingly fresh in his memory of it, and 
the same happiness beams again in his telling of a 



like pleasure in quoting Ary Sheffer's praise to 
Delacroix, and in telling him of what Goethe had 
written of his lithographs for Stappf er's translation 
of " Faust." Altogether the book is a pleasing intro- 
duction to a sort of personal acquaintance with a 
host of writers, artists, and politicians, who pass 
before the reader in splendid procession. M. Grenier 
does not attempt to fix the rank of any of them, 
merely telling his little stories of them as he knew 
them, bidding us share Mussett's passion, lament 
the " subtle harmony in the three words, fame, 
genius, misfortune," with Lamartine, and pass on 
to wait for a casual word from George Sand. 

One or two of the later volumes of 

Bruce, and other the FamoU8 Scots " series ( im- 
famous Scots. _ ., .V 

ported by ocribner) are less inter- 
esting than their predecessors, sometimes because 
the best subjects have been already handled, and 
sometimes for another reason. In the case of the 
volume on Robert Bruce, the necessity of detailing 
many matters of history makes the biography of 
the thinnest. There is no more famous Scot than 
Robert Bruce : he is the knightly hero of Scotland, 
even more than Sir William Wallace. But he lived 
centuries ago, at a time of which the history is not 
clearly understood in all details. Mr. Murison, then, 
here as in his volume on Wallace, has to spend a 
good part of his book in explanation and contro- 
versy. The result is not entertaining although it 
has value for purposes of information. The vol- 
ume on Alexander Melville, by Mr. William Mor- 
ison, has something of the same drawback. Mel- 
ville was a typical figure, if not a man of remark- 
able character ; and it is proper that he should be 
represented in any general group of Scotch worthies. 
On the other hand, his life is hard to write and not 
very easy to read. He had so much to do with the 
public affairs of his time, that one must spend too 
much space in recounting the stages in a struggle 
of which the results only are clearly remembered. 
Melville was the representative of Scottish Presby- 
terianism as against King James the Sixth of Scot- 
land and the First of England. He was beaten in 
the great cause to which he devoted his life, but it 
was through him and many lesser men like him 
that the cause itself was victorious.

" Hermann von Helmholtz," by Mr. John Gray 
M'Kendrick, M.D. Of the great French physiol- 
ogist to whom we owe our present knowledge of the 
pancreatic functions, the facts concerning his pro- 
fessional life are made sufficiently clear, and in so 
far his life is to be followed with interest ; but after 
a brief insight into his private and personal affairs 
granted at the outset of the book, the rest is per- 
mitted to remain undisclosed. If it is interesting 
to read the man in his work, it is no less interesting

to read the work through the man, and the book 
leaves a sense of incompleteness. Of the German 
whose investigations in optics and acoustics were 
epoch-making, there is here the opportunity to read 
of what it was he stood for, to his friends as well as 
to the scientific world. But we miss all reference 
to the attack upon Darwinism which is still a matter 
of surprise to those who think with Haeckel, and are 
hardly to be consoled by such a phrase as "... 
the Darwinian hypothesis, with which Helmholtz 
often expressed his general agreement." Both 
books give portraits of the men of whom they treat, 
as frontispieces, and the serene majesty of their 
countenances brings forth the reflection that no- 
where has man found the expression of intellectual 
development more complete than in the faces of 
the modern men of science. It is because they are 
in constant pursuit of nothing less than Truth? 

There is much diversity of interest 



Likings " (Small, Maynard & Co.), 
of which our notice has been too long delayed. The 
dozen or more papers that make up the volume are 
mostly reprinted from the literary periodicals (THE 
DIAL among others), although two of them did 
their previous public duty as lectures. These two 
are discussions of " Washington Irving's Services 
to American History " and " Renaissance Pictures 
in Browning's Poetry." One paper is a study in 
"the literary time-spirit," as illustrated by Herr 
BjOrnson, M. Daudet, Mr. Henry James three 
writers who assuredly were never before grouped 
together, yet who have enough in common to jus- 
tify the present classification. Mr. Burton ventures, 
in another paper, to discuss the perilous subject of 
" The Democratic and Aristocratic in Literature," 
and escapes the extravagance which usually over- 
takes those who essay this theme. A group of three 
short papers on aspects of " Old English Poetry " 
betrays both the scholarly student and the appre- 
ciative reader. " Phases of Fiction " affords a col- 
lective title for four brief essays. Brownell and 
Stevenson are made the subjects of special studies. 
Altogether, there is much vigorous and sensible 
criticism, expressed in admirable English, in this 
volume. Barring the occasional allusions to books 
that are fast sinking into forgetfulness, the matter 
which Mr. Burton offers is worth preservation, and 
speaks well for the critical intelligence of the writer.

reached a sixth edition (Francis P. Harper), afford- 
ing, it is to be hoped, some recompense to its author, 
Mr. Wilfrid Joseph Cripps, C.B., F.S.A., for his 
untiring labors in this minor department of history. 
" Sixth edition " in this case means a careful and 
thorough revision in the light of the most recent 
learning, of the entire subject, and the additions 
are both many and noteworthy. First published in 



1878, the work was a pioneer of its kind and it re- 
mains to-day the most authoritative and most inclu- 
sive, covering the plate of churches, colleges, and 
private owners alike. Considerations of the marks 
of many guilds of silversmiths, situated in many 
towns widely removed, are followed by lists of year 
marks, hall marks of all kinds, and the various 
stamps set in the finished work from the beginning 
of the practice in the early fifteenth century. The 
vexed question of the statutory origin of the year 
marks is not yet settled, though the hope is still 
strong among antiquaries that archival researches 
now going on will cast light upon the problem. The 
illustrations are excellent and profuse, and the vol- 
ume, a crown octavo, is an excellent specimen of 
book making. An earlier edition of the same book 
has appeared in America, somewhat abridged, and 
without authorization. 



In " Great Britain and Hanover " 
( xford Diversity Press), Mr. A. 
W. Ward presents the Ford lectures 
delivered by him last year in the University of Ox- 
ford. While Mr. Ward's attention is chiefly devoted 
to the international action of Great Britain as 
affected by Hanoverian interests, he does not fail 
to consider also the effect of the personal union on 
the home policy of the two countries. His analysis 
of the situation leads him to conclude that, in some 
instances, the popular outcry against the use of the 
union for dynastic ends, was justified, notably when, 
at the expense of England's true policy, Bremen 
and Verden were transferred from Sweden to Han- 
over. Taken all in all, however, British interests 
were well conserved by British statesmen, and, in the 
light of those duties of friendship really owed to 
Hanover, there was small ground for the prevailing 
dissatisfaction with the " Hanoverian policy." In 
Hanover, on the other hand, the Union, regarded 
with extreme favor at first, " came very slowly, but 
very surely, to be recognized as having retarded an 
enduring association with the fortunes of the Ger- 
man people, and with the future to which it was 
looking forward." While the author disclaims any 
profound investigation of documentary evidence, 
the book is essentially the work of a scholar, written 
only after careful study,* and distinguished by its 
fairness of view.

Mr. Le Roy Hooker expresses the

drawn all his blood. But as his investigation deep- 
ened and broadened he lost all his admiration for

over her tergiversations, broken promises, and wild 
mismanagements. His book is inclusive, and pre-

of " doing ill that good may come " in religious 
matters, the same doctrine finds easy acceptance 
when the ends which justify the means are those of 
patriotism or " civilization." 

The issue of "The Day's Work" 
and " From Sea to Sea," each in two 
volumes of the " Outward Bound " 
edition of the works of Rudyard Kipling (Scribner), 
offers an opportunity, of which we cannot avail our- 
selves at this moment, for a consideration of some 
of the aspects of Mr. Kipling's later work. Since 
" Captains Courageous," which was the last of the 
original twelve volumes of this edition, Mr. Kipling 
has written a good deal that has been variously criti- 
cised. There have been those who thought that 
Mr. Kipling had reached a parting of the ways, and 
had chosen the wrong road. We think ourselves 
that Mr. Kipling's later work has the same funda- 
mental qualities that his earlier work had, that it 
lacks some of the characteristics that were apt to 
mar his first stories, and has gained other charac- 
teristics, some of which are not entirely admirable. 
Really far more interesting (or extraordinary) than 
an understanding of Mr. Kipling is the way in 
which Mr. Kipling has been understood, especially 
in this country. This is one of the most instructive 
things in the history of literature in America. It 
may be remarked that " From Sea to Sea " is not 
illustrated from the models of Mr. Lockwood Kip- 
ling, but from photographs of the places in question. 

An Englishman Had Mr ; George C. Musgrave pub- 
with. the Cuban lished his " Under Three Flags in 
insurgents. Cuba" (Little, Brown, & Co.) a 

year earlier, it is safe to say that it would have 
been regarded as a work of the first importance. 
Even now, with its appearance sadly belated through 
the author's continued illness after the hardships of 
his life in Cuba, it is not a book to be lightly read 
or disregarded. Mr. Musgrave was an Englishman 
holding Spain in high favor when he went to the 
island as a correspondent for a British journal, and 
the knowledge gained on the ground saw him 
within a few months fighting in the insurgent ranks. 
He bears the testimony of an eye-witness to the 
disinterested valor of the Cuban patriots, but he 
makes little prophecy for the future. 

CuMs Relations Sach an enquiry into the facts which 
with. Spain and are of mutual interest to Cuba and 
the United stdie*. the United States as "Cuba and 
International Relations" (The Johns Hopkins Press), 
reflects no little credit upon its author, Dr. James 
Morton Callahan, Ph.D., the Albert Shaw lecturer 
in diplomatic history in the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity. Carefully threading his way between the 
devious diplomacy of Spain and the confused par- 



tisan politics of the United States, he fairly ex- 
hausts his subject within the compass of five hundred 
octavo pages. It is safe to conclude that no future 
historian of Spain, Cuba, or the United States, can 
afford to neglect Dr. Callahan in any of his state- 
ments or conclusions, which appear to be as well 
considered as his researches have been thorough. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



It is not often that a scholar of Professor Paul 
Shorey's rank is found willing to perform the drudgery 
incident to the annotation of an elementary English 
text, and teachers who come into possession of his 
edition of four selected books of Pope's " Iliad" (Heath) 
have much reason to be grateful. The introduction and 
notes supplied by the editor, and the pictures provided 
by the publisher, combine to make this edition one of un- 
usual value. In a general way, the editorial apparatus 
embodies the same ideas that are found in Professor 
Shorey's edition of Horace, which we had occasion to 
praise about a year ago. 

" A Primer of French Verse for Upper Forms " 
(Macmillan), edited by Mr. Frederic Spencer, has for 
its aim " to associate with interesting extracts from the 
work of numerous French poets such hints as to the 
structure of French verse as may tend to secure cor- 
rect and intelligent reading of these extracts themselves 
and adequate appreciation of the distinctive qualities 
of French poetry as therein represented." The ex- 
tracts are usually of some length, and are so happily cho- 
sen as literature (aside from their illustrative function), 
that the book has claimed more of our attention than 
we should ordinarily have given such a manual. In 
fact, the didactic part of the work has been reduced to a 
bare minimum, a feature which will recommend the 
Primer to judicious teachers and serious students. 

The third volume of "The Anglo-Saxon Review," 
dated December, 1899, has just been published in 
this country by Mr. John Lane. The binding is cop- 
ied from an example made for Charles I., and covering 
the "Bavaria Pia" of 1628. The portraits are of 
Napoleon, Canning, Mr. and Mrs. Shelley, Mr. Pad- 
erewski, and Marie de Guise-Lorraine. The text in- 
cludes the following contributions, among others : 
"War Memories," by Mr. Stephen Crane; "Our Sea- 
fights with the Dutch," by Mr. David Hannay; " Notes 
on the Venezuelan Arbitration," by Mr. G. R. Askwith ; 
a review of "Paolo and Francesca," by Dr. Garnett; 
" The Unflinching Realist," by Mr. H. D. Traill; " Past 
and Future in South Africa," by Mr. Lionel Phillips; 
and " Some Battlepieces," by Mr. Sidney Low. 

" A General Survey of American Literature " (Mc- 
Clurg), by Miss Mary Fisher, is an attempt to make 
real the personalities of our authors and to estimate 
their works according to recognized canons of sound 
criticism. Both objects seem to have been attained so 
far as the limits of the book allow. The conventional 
biographical material is treated in a pleasing style and 
with discriminating sympathy. An occasional anec- 
dote adds flavor. There is no unmerited praise of 
American letters, no hero-worship. Handsomely made 
up, and provided with an Index, the volume is a wel- 
come addition to the educational force that is empha- 
sizing things American.

NOTES. 



Mr. W. R. Jenkins publishes a pamphlet called " The 
Poet as Teacher," being an address recently given by 
Dr. Lewis F. Mott. 

"The Tears of the Heliades; or, Amber as a Gem," 
by Mr. W. Arnold Buffum, is published in an American 
edition by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

"Madame Dreyfus," a small volume just published 
by Brentano's, is an " appreciation " of that devoted wife 
and noble woman by Miss Josephine Lazarus. 

The authorized American edition of Count Tolstoi's 
novel " Resurrection," upon which he has been so long 
at work, will be issued by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
on the first of this month. 

" Orestes A. Brownson's Middle Life," covering the 
period from 1845 to 1855, being a continuation of 
" Brownson's Early Life," is published at Detroit by Mr. 
H. F. Brownson, the author. 

Richard Hovey, poet, educator, and lecturer, died in 
New York City, Feb. 26. Mr. Hovey was but thirty- 
five years of age at the time of his death, and had given 
much promise of strong poetic powers. 

Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. publish a neat edition 
of the "Letters of Thomas Gray," in a selection edited, 
with a biographical notice, by Mr. Henry Milnor 
Rideout. The volume has an etched portrait. 

Volume III. of Mr. Thomas Mackay's " History of 
the English Poor Law" covers the period from 1834 to 
the present time, and completes this important histor- 
ical work. The Messrs. Putnam are the publishers. 

"The Makers of Modern Prose," by Mr. W. J. 
Dawson (Whittaker), is a series of essays upon writers 
ranging from Johnson and Goldsmith to Raskin and 
Newman. It is a companion to the earlier volume upon 
English poets, and will be followed by a third upon 
English novelists. 

The American Book Co. issue " Our Country in Poem 
and Prose," a book of supplementary reading edited by 
Miss Eleanor A. Persons. "Four Famous American 
Writers" (Irving, Poe, Lowell, Taylor), by Mr. Sher- 
win Cody, is a volume of similar intent issued by the 
Werner School Book Co. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. announce their removal 
to their new building at 35th St. and 5th Ave., where 
they will occupy greatly enlarged quarters. Upper 
Fifth avenue is steadily growing in favor with the New 
York book trade, and many of the leading houses are 
now located in that section of the city. 

" The Rise of Formal Satire in England under Class- 
ical Influence," by Mr. Raymond Macdonald Alden, is 
a doctoral dissertation expanded for publication by the 
University of Pennsylvania. It adds one more to the 
list of scholarly monographs by which our universities 
are doing so much for the scientific study of English 
literature. 

" Kant and Spencer," by Dr. Paul Carus, is published 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. It is a reprint of 
matter from " The Open Court " and " The Monist," 
and the author is essentially right in the controversy, 
although he seems to inject into his comments more 
acerbity than is strictly necessary for the sustaining of 
his position. 

What is likely to prove the definitive and standard 
library edition of Tennyson has been published in ten 
volumes by the Macmillan Co. It includes the " Life," 
by the present Lord Tennyson, which fills four volumes 



out of the ten. Chaste simplicity and dignity are the 
characteristics of this set of volumes from the mechan- 
ical point of view. The illustrations, of which each 
volume has at least one, are nearly all portraits in pho- 
togravure, and include all the familiar examples, besides 
some of the less familiar ones made by the camera of 
Mrs. Cameron. 

Publishing a Book " (Heath), by Mr. Charles Welsh, 
is one of those small manuals put forth from time to 
time for the practical guidance of inexperienced writers 
for the press. It is a small volume, containing only the 
bare essentials. The directions are clearly given, and 
young writers who follow them will save themselves 
much annoyance. 

Mr. Gold win Smith's "Shakespeare: The Man " 
(Doubleday) is a rather slight essay which seeks to do 
what Mr. Frank Harris attempted a few years ago 
upon a more elaborate scale, and what Dr. Brandes 
makes the essential thesis of his great critical work 
on Shakespeare namely, to find indications of the 
poet's personality in the text of his plays. That the 
essay has both critical value and charm of expression 
may be taken for granted. 

The article on " Byron's Influence upon Goethe," in 
this issue of THE DIAL, derives a sad interest from the 
death of its author, which occurred at Evanston, Illi- 
nois, the 28th of January. Miss Anna M. Bowen, a 
woman of rare qualities of character and scholarship, 
held, at the age of twenty-seven, the responsible posi- 
tion of Dean of the Woman's College of Northwestern 
University, at which institution she was graduated in 
1893, afterwards studying at Cornell University, and 
later at Leipsic and Munich. Some of the results of 
her German studies she had planned to embody in a 
series of articles on Byron's influence on German lit- 
erature, of which series, now interrupted by her death, 
the article in this number was intended as the beginning.

SAMSON OCCOM 

And the Christian Indians of New England 

By W. DeLOSS LOVE, Ph.D., 

Author of "The Fast and Thanksgiving Days of New England." 

Published by 

THE PILGRIM PRESS, CONGREGATIONAL HOUSE, BOSTON. 
Limited Edition, printed from type, 379 pp., with illus- 
trations $1.50 net. 

rPHIS volume is a historical study of Indian civilization as illustrated 
in the life and labors of Samson Occom, the Mohegan teacher, mis- 
sionary, hymn-writer, and statesman. The author, after reviewing the 
relation of the New England fathers to Indian civilization in the first 
century of our history, takes up the work of the second century among 
the Indians of southern New England, of whom Samson Occom was the 
central figure. He tells the story of the hero's youth, education as the 
pupil of Rev. Eleazar Wheelock of Lebanon, Conn., and experiences as 
an Indian teacher among the Montauk tribe. An account is then given 
of Wheelock's Indian Charity School and the Indians who were there 
educated, many of whom were associates in Occom's work. This 
Mohegan was the first New England missionary sent to the Oneida 
Indians, and his mission thither is detailed, with that of David Fowler 
and other Christian Indians who were the companions of Samuel Kirk- 
land. The relation of Samson Occom to the famous Mohegan Land 
Case, his experiences as a preacher in England, and his work as a hymn- 
writer are treated. The crowning honor of this Indian's life, however, 
was his formation of the Brothertown tribe out of the Christian Indians 
at Mohegan, Grot on, Stonington, Niantic, Farmington, Charlestown, 
R. I., and Montauk, L. I., their emigration to the Oneida country under 
his leadership, and the establishment of their Indian town, which they 
governed under the supervision of the State of New York for half a 
century. The story follows the experiences of this "Indian Moses " 
among Indians and whites till his death in 1792. It also narrates the 
subsequent history of the Brothertown tribe to the present time, giving 
an account of their removal to Wisconsin, and participation in the 
award of nearly two million dollars recently made to the New York 
Indians in their claim against the United States. The author of this 
volume has found his material mainly in imprinted manuscripts.

HAVE JUST PUBLISHED 

JOHN RUSKIN 

A Sketch of His Life, His Work, and His Opinions, with Personal 

Reminiscences. 

Together with a Paper by John Ruskin Entitled "The Black Arts," and a Note 

on Ruskin, by Harrison S. Morris, Managing Director of the 

Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia. 

BY M. H. SPIELMANN, 

Author o/'< The Works of G. F. Watts, R.A.," etc., Editor of" The Magazine of Art." 
ILLUSTRATED. 12MO, ORNAMENTAL BINDING, GILT TOP, ROUGH EDGES ; PRICE, $2.00. 

Mr. Spielmann not only tells the story of Ruskin's life, but also gives the little details 
relating to Ruskin as his friends knew him, to Ruskin the man, the artist, the fearless cham- 
pion of righteousness in art, in economics, in morals, in life itself, and his account is illum- 
inated by scraps of correspondence, an especially interesting case being a series relating to 
George Cruikshank. The book is particularly valuable, in that the true inwardness of such a 
life as Ruskin's can be comprehended only from the writings of one who knew and loved the 
man. The illustrations are worthy of the subject.

A SELECTION FROM 

Houghton, Mifflin & Company's Spring Books 



Robert Tournay 

A Romance of the French Revolution. By WILLIAM 
SAGE. With illustrations. Crown 8vo, 81.50. 
This story has much of the interest of Dickens's 
French Revolution story, "A Tale of Two Cities." 
The spirit and atmosphere of that tremendous time 
pervade it. Tournay is a thoroughly interesting char- 
acter patriotic, well-nigh omnipresent, fertile in re- 
source, chivalrous, especially to the aristocratic lady 
he loves. The story is full of incidents, and is told 
very effectively. Illustrations add much to its interest. 

The Mississippi Valley in the Civil 
War 

By JOHN FISKE. With 18 maps. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 
An exceedingly clear and interesting account of the 
course and significant events of the War for the Union 
in the Valley of the Mississippi. Its nine chapters 
treat : From St. Louis to Belmont, Fort Donelson and 
Shiloh, The Navy and New Orleans, From Corinth to 
Stone River, The Vicksburg Problem, The Fall of 
Vicksburg, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Nashville. 

The Queen's Garden 

By MRS. M. E. M. DAVIS, author of " Under the Man- 
Fig " and " The Wire-Cutters." 16mo, 31.25. 
A romantic story of New Orleans, including a yel- 
low-fever episode ; a Paul-and- Virginia love affair 
which prospers as it should ; attractive descriptions of 
scenes in the city, and truthful accounts of sundry 
tragic experiences, which, however, do not interfere 
with the right movement and outcome of the story. 

Poor People 

A Novel. By I. K. FRIEDMAN. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
A striking story of Chicago, dealing with tenement 
life, its experiences, its labor, its hardships, its follies, 
as well as its heroisms and fidelities, its outlook on 
life, and its romance. Mr. Friedman's story shows 
the conscientious care with which he has observed life 
in this social level, by no means the lowest, also his 
kindly sympathy. 

A Ten Years' War 

An Account of the Battle with the Slum in New 
York. By JACOB A. RIIS, author of " How the 
Other Half Lives," etc. With 12 illustrations from 
photographs. 12mo, $1.50. 

Mr. Riis is an expert in the field of philanthropy 
which relates to the life of the poor in cities. This 
book is peculiarly interesting and informing. It treats 
The Battle with the Slum, The Tenement House and 
Its Blight, The Tenant, The Genesis of the Gang, Let- 
ting in the Light, Justice for the Boy, and Reform by 
Humane Touch. 



Knights in Fustian 

By CAROLINE BROWN. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

A spirited story based on the operations of the 
Knights of the Golden Circle, largely in Indiana, dur- 
ing the War for the Union. Governor Morton figures 
in it, also Vallandingham ; and a charming love story 
runs through the deeply interesting book. 

The Son of the Wolf 

Tales of the Far North. By JACK LONDON. Crown 

8vo, $1.50. 

Mr. London here makes the first contribution from 
Alaska to the literature of fiction. The stories are 
based on his experiences and observations in that 
region, and contain vivid pictures of life in the vicinity 
of the Yukon, with its privations, hardships, heroisms, 
and romance. 

" The Son of the Wolf " is the Indian name for the 
white man, and the stories give striking descriptions 
of the Yukon Indians and their connection with their 
white neighbors. Mr. London is a born story-teller. 

The Light of Day 

Religious Discussions and Criticisms from the Stand- 
point of a Naturalist. By JOHN BURROUGHS. 
16mo, $1.25; uniform with the Riverside Edition 
of Burroughs's Works. 12mo, gilt top, $1.50. 
This book is a very frank statement of Mr. Bur- 
rougbs's views on matters theological and religious. 
The principal contents are : From the Artificial to 
the Natural, Science and Theology, Natural versus 
Supernatural, The Decadence of Theology, Religious 
Truth, Points of View, Meditations and Criticisms. 

The Prelude and the Play 

A Novel. By RUFUS MANN. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

The scene of the first part of this story is laid in a 
large university town. The heroine, a college girl of 
talent and distinction, marries the captain of a victori- 
ous eleven. They go West to live, and are gradually 
estranged by the pressure of business and the tem- 
porary lack of tactful sympathy. All this is very well 
told, also the way in which they are reunited. It is a 
very bright novel, and is likely to excite no little dis- 
cussion. 

A Danvis Pioneer 

By ROWLAND E. ROBINSON, author of " Danvis 

Folks," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Robinson is a thoroughly loyal Vermonter. 
This story deals with the settling of Vermont, the 
struggles between the Green Mountain Boys and the 
" Yorkers," and the beginning of the Revolution. The 
" pioneer " is Josiah Hill, who later figures as 
Granther Hill."

Bird Studies with a Camera. 

With Introductory Chapters on the Outfit and Methods of the Bird Photographer. By FRANK 
M. CHAPMAN, Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Zoology in the American Museum of 
Natural History ; author of " Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America " and " Bird 
Life." Illustrated with over 100 photographs from nature by the author. 12 mo, cloth. 
(Ready early in April.} 

Bird students and photographers will find that this book possesses for them a unique interest and value. It 
contains fascinating accounts of the habits of some of our common birds and descriptions of the largest bird 
colonies existing in Eastern North America; while its author's phenomenal success in photographing birds in 
Nature not only lends to the illustrations the charm of realism, but makes the book a record of surprising achieve- 
ments with the camera. Several of these illustrations have been described by experts as " the most remarkable 
photographs of wild life we have ever seen." The book is practical as well as descriptive, and in the opening 
chapters the questions of camera, lens, plates, blinds, decoys, and other pertinent matters are fully discussed, 
making the work an admirable guide for the camera hunter, who can not but be stimulated by its author's enthu- 
siasm and convincing demonstration of the methods he recommends. It is of course unnecessary to speak of the 
author's high standing as an ornithologist, his " Handbook of Birds " and " Bird-Life " having taken a leading 
place among books upon birds.

History of the People of the United States. 

By Prof. JOHN BACH McMASTER. Vol. V. 8vo, cloth, with maps, $2.50. 
The fifth volume of Prof. J. B. McMaster's "History of the' People of the United States" deals with the 
close of Monroe's term, the administrations of John Quincy Adams, and the stormy opening years of Andrew 
Jackson. It describes the development of the democratic spirit, the manifestations of new interests in social 
problems, and the various conditions and plans presented between 1821 and 1830. To a large extent the intimate 
phases of the subjects which are treated have received scant attention heretofore. A peculiar interest attaches 
to the various banking and financial experiments proposed and adopted at that time, to the humanitarian and 
socialistic movements, the improvements in the conditions of city life, to the author's full presentation of the 
literary activity of the country, and his treatment of the relations of the East and West. Many of these 
subjects have necessitated years of first-hand investigations and are now treated adequately for the first time. 

The Theory and Practice of Taxation.

SIXTEEN IMPORTANT SPRING BOOKS 



NOVELS. 

COUNT LEO TOLSTOY. 
Resurrection. By Count LEO TOLSTOY. 12mo, 

cloth, with illustrations $1.50 

This novel of Tolstoy's is a sombre but tremendously powerful novel 
touching upon many of the tragedies and problems of life in the Russia 
of to-day. It shows the genius of " Anna Karenina " blended with a 
more mature comprehension of human life and human character. The 
"Great Master of the North" has written in "Resurrection" a har- 
rowing yet absorbing story with all his old fervor and with a deeper and 
more searching spiritual understanding. 

S. R. CROCKETT. 

Joan of the Sword Hand. By S. R. CROCKETT, 
author of "The Lilac Sunbonnet," " The Raiders," etc. 

12mo, cloth, illustrated $1.50 

A captivating romance of the fifteenth century. "Joan of the 
Sword Hand " is a charming young princess, who is none the less charm- 
ing for her ability to defend herself and her kingdom when the necessity 
arises (as it does more than once) by her dexterous use of the sword. 

MAX PEMBERTON. 

Feo. By MAX PEMBERTON, author of " The Garden 
of Swords," " Kronstadt," etc. 12mo, cloth, illus. $1.50 
In England, Mr. Pembert on is one of the most popular writers of the 

present day in fiction, and it is gratifying to note that the gale of his 

novels in America is increasing with every year. 

" F&> " treats of the infatuation of Prince Jerome for a young opera 

singer and the romantic consequences of his passion. 

WALTER BESANT. 

The Alabaster Box. By WALTER BESANT, author 

of " The Orange Girl," etc. 12rao, cloth . . . $1.50 

This is a story of settlement life, and in it is shown from actual 

knowledge and observation the effect of the life upon the workers. The 

principal figure is a yonng man of wealth who is ambitious and able. 

He goes to the settlement out of curiosity, and the work and the people 

with whom he comes in contact change his entire character. 

PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR. 

The Strength of Gideon. By PAUL LAURENCE 

DUNBAR, author of "Folks from Dixie," "Poems of 

Cabin and Field," etc. 12mo, cloth, illustrated . $1.25 

In "Folks from Dixie," Mr. Dunbar's first volume of stories, he 

exhibited qualities which placed him in the front rank of short-story 

writers, and this second volume, while in a measure covering new 

ground, again illustrates his command of humor and pathos. Some of 

these stories have appeared in the magazines, others are now published 

for the first time. 

JEROME K. JEROME. 

Three Men on Wheels. By JEROME K. JEROME, 
author of " Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow," etc. 12mo, 
cloth, illustrated $1.50 

This book is a sequel to the famous " Three Men in a Boat." The 
three men in this case are the same, and their experiences upon this bicy- 
cle tour through Germany are as delightfully absurd as they were upon 
their former expedition in search of rest and recreation. " Three Men on 
Wheels" is in every wayup to the standard of "Three Men ina Boat." 

W. PETT RIDGE. 

Outside the Radius. By W. PETT RIDGE, author 
of " A Son of State," " By Order of the Magistrate," etc. 
12mo, cloth $1.25 

This is a series of stories, each complete in itself yet connected, for all 
are centred in a certain small village which, though ' 'outside the radius, ' ' 
may be easily identified by those familiar with London and its environs. 



BELL ES-LETTRES. 
T. EDGAR PEMBERTON. 

The Kendals. A Biography. By T. EDGAR PEM- 
BERTON. 8vo, cloth, with 20 illustrations . . . $3.0O 
This is the story of the life chiefly the professional life of Mr. 
and Mrs. William Hunter Grimston, known to the world as Mr. 
and Mrs. Kendal. Few actors and actresses have so deservedly won 
their way to the affections of the people as have this talented couple, 
and it is reasonable to suppose that their admirers in both England and 
America will be glad to learn more about them. 

L. COPE CORNFORD. 
Stevenson. By L. COPE CORNFORD. 12mo, cloth, 

price $1.25 

This is the second volume in the new and important series of liter- 
ary monographs, biographical and critical. The subject of the first was 
Matthew Arnold, by Professor Saintsbury. Others will follow at regular 
intervals by W. E. Henley, Augustine Birrell, Andrew Lang, Alice 
Meynell, and others. Mr. Cornford is well qualified to speak on Steven- 
son, and has treated him from a point of view refreshingly new. 

ANDREW LANG. 
A History of Scotland. By ANDREW LANG. To 

be completed in three volumes. Vol. I. to be ready in the 

Spring of 1900. 8vo, cloth. 

This is the first volume of an important and authoritative history 
of Scotland. Mr. Lang is himself a Scot, and imparts therefore a fervor 
and an interest to the narrative quite his own. 

As for the literary and historical character of the work, little more 
need be said than that it is by the author of " Homer and the Epic." 

RELIGION AND POETRY. 

DEAN FARRAR. 

The Life of Lives; or, Further Studies in the Life of 

Christ. By Rev. Dr. W. F. FARRAR, Dean of Canterbury, 

author of " The Life of Christ," etc. 12mo, cloth. $2.00. 

PARTIAL COMTBNTS : Our Lord's Human Aspect The Language 

He Spoke The Age in Which He Lived Lessons of the Unrecorded 

Years Judaism The First Anecdote Methods of Evangelization 

Forms of Teaching, their Uniqueness Jesus and Children The 

Gladness of Jesus The Apostles, etc. 

LYMAN ABBOTT. 
Problems of Life. By LYMAN ABBOTT. 12mo, 

cloth Probably $1.50 

This book is made up of selections from the writings of Lyman 
Abbott. They bear directly upon certain problems of life and character 
with which every man is confronted, and which many find capable of 
no apparent solution. Dr. Abbott is a prophet of clear vision and deep 
insight, and his words are most helpful and illuminating. 

W. ROBERTSON NICOLL, LL.D. 
Family Worship. Edited and arranged by Dr. 

NICOLL. 12mo $1.75 

This is a new and compact collection of Service and Prayers for 
Family Worship, Morning Prayers, etc. 

HARRY THURSTON PECK. 
Grey Stone and Porphyry. By HARRY THURS- 
TON PECK, author of " What is Good English, and Other 
Essays," "Trimalchio's Dinner," etc. 12mo, cloth $1.25 
This is the first book of verse by Professor Peck. Many of the poems 
included in it have appeared in The Bookman and other periodicals but 
some are for the first time published. Several of them have been 
widely copied, attesting their appeal to the popular heart, and all bear 
testimony to the amazing versatility of their author. 



THE BOER WAR. 
ALBERT STICKNEY. The Transvaal Outlook. By ALBERT STICKNEY. 8 vo, cloth . . $1.50 

Considers the political aspects of the struggle, the causes that gave rise to it, the military predicament of the British, and predicts the 
probable conclusion. His deductions, it may be stated, are immensely in favor of the Boers, and the leaning to their side is perhaps greater than in 
that of any work heretofore published in America. The work is made doubly valuable by the addition of colored maps made expressly for the work. 

G. W. STEEVENS. From Cape Town to Ladysmith. By G. W. STEEVENS, author of With 

Kitchener to Khartum," etc. 12mo, cloth $1.25 

The writer, probably the best known war correspondent of the time, has written many books of travel and many brilliant records of fighting, 
but to none of these will attach the peculiar and melancholy interest which can be claimed for this. It is a matter of common knowledge that the 
author died of enteric fever, a captive in Ladysmith. The march to that place and the desperate siege of it are wonderfully described, and it 
will take rank among the great "adventure " writing of the time.

HAVE NOW BEADY 

TOLSTOY'S GREAT NOVEL 

Entitled : 

"RESURRECTION" 

By the Author of "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," 

etc., etc. 

12mo, Cloth, with Illustrations. $1.50. 



THIS novel of Tolstoy's, it was feared, would not be completed in time for Spring pub- 
lication, but the publishers are glad to announce that Count Tolstoy's health has per- 
mitted his completing it and that the American edition is now ready. 

It is a sombre but tremendously powerful novel touching upon many tragedies and 
problems of life in the Russia of to-day. It shows the genius of "Anna Karenina " blend- 
ed with a more mature comprehension of human life and character. The " Great Master 
of the North " has written in " Resurrection " a harrowing yet absorbing story with all his 
old fervor, and with a deeper and more searching spiritual understanding. The theme is 
that of a woman's life weighed down and well nigh extinguished by the most terrible mis- 
fortunes and tragedies, but finally, through the power of love, resurrected and made new. 

Count Tolstoy's determination to write no more fiction has been overcome by his de- 
sire to assist the Doukhobors in their exodus from their grievous oppression in Russia to 
the provinces of Canada. Five years ago he wrote the synopsis of this novel, which he 
then laid aside, but has since taken up and completed. It is published simultaneously in 
Russia, Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Great Britain, and America, and the pro- 
ceeds will be devoted to settling the Doukhobors in their Canadian home. 

A CELEBRATED CRITIC HAS SAID OF IT: 

"There is little in this noble and yet heart-breaking work to explain the prudery of 
those who wanted to take great liberties with the original. Here and there a few lines 
might with advantage be omitted. But the purpose of the great author is so manifestly 
pure, and the form in which he has cast his thought is so impeccable, that only the inde- 
cent could take umbrage. ' Resurrection ' will rank with the most vital and beautiful 
studies of our poor humanity the world has seen."

SANDBURRS. 

When " Wolfville " was published two years ago it 
met with an immediate and unmistakable success. 
The author's style was so vigorous, and so appropri- 
ate to the scenes and people treated, and his wit so 
fresh and original, that his work was placed at once 
in the front rank of books dealing with Western life. 

Since then Mr. Lewis has been so occupied with his 
journalistic duties that his publishers have been un- 
able to secure another book from him until now. 

" Sandburrs," his new work, is a collection of Mr. 
Lewis's characteristic sketches that have appeared in 
the newspapers during the last two years. There are 
half a dozen " Wolfville " stories, where we meet our 
old friends " Dock Peets," "Jack Enrighl," and others, 
and there is a series of " Annals of the Bend," in which 
we are introduced to the shades and shadows of some 
lower grades of New York life. There are also a 
number of character sketches all marked by Mr. 
Lewis's peculiar humor, and depicted with his well- 
known literary skill. 

There is a variety about these sketches that makes 
" Sandburrs " an unusually interesting volume.

A MASTER OF CRAFT. 

A new novel by this delightful humorist. The 
hero, Captain Flower, is the captain of a coasting 
vessel of the kind made famous by Mr. Jacobs in 
" Many Cargoes," and " More Cargoes." The Cap- 
tain confesses to having a great fascination for women, 
and when the story opens he is engaged to three of 
them, and in one case under an assumed name. 

His struggles to escape a breach of promise suit, and 
other threatened calamities furnish Mr. Jacobs with a 
story that is well Jilted to his humor.

THE MINX. 

A story of English society life that is not common- 
place, a story without a villian or an adventuress, but 
none the less one that is full of interest, and holds 
the reader enthralled. The heroes are a ruined En- 
glish aristocrat, and a rich English radical, whose 
friendship for each other, and love for the same 
woman the " minx " lead to strange complications. 

Lovers of literary workmanship of the highest qual- 
ity witty, graceful, and convincing will enjoy 
every page of one of the best novels of the day. Two 
episodes a fox-hunt, and an accident in a mine 
are especially noteworthy.

good, $1.50.

GEBER. 

A Tale of Harun the Khalif. 

Harun Al llaschid is a name familiar to everyone, 
but little has been written of his time and period ex- 
cept in histories that are slightly known and almost 
inaccessible. 

This romance of Mrs. Benton is one seriously con- 
sidered, and successfully carried out. It deals with 
the latter part of the reign of Harun, and tells the 
story of the fall of the great Barmek family. 

Geber, after whom the novel is named, and of 
whose great skill as a physician we have only a frag- 
mentary knowledge, of course plays a prominent part ; 
but the story is not so much the record of one man as 
it is a gorgeous and splendid history of a court that 
was marked by a magnificence and splendor not sur- 
passed by the pomp of the greatest monarchs the 
world has known. 

No more fascinating period of history could have 
been chosen by Mrs. Benton than the time of Harun, 
nor one about which so little is known, and there is 
so much curiosity.

MARCELLE OF THE QUARTER. 

A charming romance, with the scene laid in Paris. 
The chief character is a young artist, who, on the 
death of one of his models, gives her little daughter 
a father's care. As time goes on he becomes famous, 
and the real story begins when the child, Marcelle, 
has grown up, and her protector has to consider her 
future. He and his companions are Bohemians, but 
of the best class, and Mr. Holland's pictures of their 
lives are exceedingly interesting and truthful. 

No book of recent years describes so well the better 
kind of Parisian artistic life, and Mr. Holland has 
succeeded in making an unusual love story, with touches 
of pathos that are masterful. 

Size 4| x 7 inches, cloth, cover by F. Berkeley 
Smith, $1.25. 

By CLIVE HOLLAND, 
Author of " My Japanese Wife," etc. 



THE CAMBRIC MASK. 

A novel by a versatile and powerful writer, in an 
entirely new vein that is sure of a warm welcome. 

This thoroughly American story is one of the pres- 
ent time, with a stirring plot, a love story of an un- 
usual and interesting sort, and many of the evidences 
of a keen and loving appreciation of nature, such as 
were shown in Mr. Chambers's story of the Maine 
Woods in "The Haunts of Men" stories that such 
discerning critics as " Droch," and James L. Ford 
look upon as showing this author at his very best.

Cljrontc Eoafer. 



By NELSON LLOYD. Cloth, 8vo. Price, $1.25. 

We wish to draw your attention to this unique book. It is a distinct 
contribution to the fund of American humor. So fresh, so spontaneous is 
the fun, that The Chronic Loafer is a delight. Mr. Lloyd is funny because he cannot help it. The character of the Chronic Loafer evinces 
the xenial philosophy of living. Flashes of ready wit, deep pathos and genuine humor are interwoven with an irresistible charm. Mr. Lloyd 
writes with authority. His characters are alive. From cover to cover The Chronic Loafer is full of wit, wisdom, incident, and constant 
surprises. Above and around all, is an atmosphere of reality ; all the more convincing because of a delicious sense of the ridiculous. 

By KATE UPSON CLARKE. Cloth, 8vo. $1.25. 

Kate Upson Clark has long been recognized as a most versatile writer of 
short stories. White Butterflies contains many examples of her best work. 
Mrs. Clark possesses fine, high imagination, and a strong unaffected style. White Butterflies is a volume of her best stories, includ- 
ing The Charcoal Burners, Lyddy Washburn's Courtship, The Case of Parson Hewlett, and other tales of western and New 
England life.

One of our book buyers writes us : " Every American parent owes Mrs. Barr a vote of thanks for writing a book which may be placed 
with impunity in the hands of our girls and boys. There are plenty of novels and always books for boys, but it is difficult to find a good, 
strong, pure, and interesting story for girls. Trinity Bells is the best book yet of its kind. It should be on the shelves of every good 

Ubrary " THE PRESS SAYS:

Crtnttt) 



LITERARY WORLD, Boston : 

We have here a book rich in felicitous phrase and the music of a 
noble life. In idea and execution this is one of the author's best 
works, and well worthy of its superb dress of silver and green. 
THE DETROIT FREE PRESS: 

The charming little Dutch maiden, who is the heroine of the tale, 
will make an irresistible appeal to all who love a good, clean, whole- 
some story, that old and young may read with enjoyment. 
THE OUTLOOK: 

A splendidly written story of a young girl's life in the days of 
Dutch New York. 
ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT : 

Trinity Bells is one of the best stories ever written by Amelia E. 
Barr. It is a tale of old New York, and shows to perfection the 
charm and subtle power of the author. 



BOSTON TIMES : 

Trinity Bells shows Mrs. Barr's charm and power in all its force 
and beauty. Best of all it is a book old and young will delight in 
and which will fix the historical events of that period more firmly in 
the mind. It is the time of Stephen Decatur and his subjection of 
the Dey of Algiers, and beside its historical value it is vastly enter- 
taining. 

THE BOOK BUYER: 

There is a charm in Mrs Barr's work that goes directly to the 
heart, while her skill in the delineation of character is no less effect- 
ive in its appeal to the mind. The story is an excellent minor histo- 
rical romance, worthy of permanent place in a young girl's library. 

THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE : 

Catharine Van Clyffe herself is a sweet little maid and her story 
is well worth the telling.

THE HOUSE OF MOLIERE. 

The destruction by fire of the Theatre-Fran- 
cais, on the eighth of this month, is one of 
those calamities which appeal with overwhelm- 
ing force to the sympathies of the small but 
world-wide public of cultivated people. To 
the large general public, no doubt, which weighs 
disasters chiefly by the number of human lives 
concerned, such an event is merely the loss of 
an interesting building, to be deplored for a 
brief space and then forgotten. But to the 
comparative few who know for what the Maison 
de Moliere has stood in the development of 
dramatic art and the history of human intelli- 
gence, the thought of its destruction, together 
with that of its priceless historical and artistic 
contents, is one of those intolerable oppressions 
that the mind refuses to bear all at once, that 
have to be gradually realized as one detail after 
another, whether derived from closet-study or 
from intimate personal association, comes back 
to the memory, to be reviewed in the new light 
of the knowledge that all these things are now 
of the past indeed. It seems that the exterior 
of the building may yet be preserved ; it seems 
also that some of the treasures of painting and 
sculpture were rescued from the flames ; but no 
reconstruction of the famous edifice, no recon- 
stitution of its collections, can ever again make 
it what it was, or offer to the twentieth-century 
pilgrim of culture such a shrine, hallowed by 
such relics, as the old building offered to the 
pilgrim of the nineteenth. 

The precursors of the Theatre-Francais are 
to be found in the Hotel de Bourgogne of 1548, 
the Hotel du Petit-Bourbon of 1677, the early 
seventeenth century Theatre du Marais and 
salles de spectacle of the Palais- Royal. Two 
or three other theatres had a brief vogue dur- 
ing the seventeenth century, but it was not 
until the year 1680 that the action was taken 
which determines the beginnings of the The- 
atre-Fransais in the strict sense. In that year 
the actors of the Marais and the Bourgogne 
joined forces, and were united by royal decree 
into the company of the Comedie-Fran9aise, 
which still survives, after a corporate existence 
of over two centuries, almost the only institu- 
tion of the Ancien Regime that was not swept 
away by the Revolution. It is to be noted that

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



Moliere and his fellow-players, after the period 
of their strolling apprenticeship to the stage, 
came to Paris in 1658, and played at the Petit- 
Bourbon and the Palais-Royal. Moliere died in 
1673, and after his death his companions united 
with the Marais troupe, thus joining the tradi- 
tion of Moliere with the tradition of Corneille. 
The tradition of Racine was added by the fusion 
with the Bourgogne troupe, and thus, in 1680, 
the Comedie-Fran9aise came into its inherit- 
ance of the three great dramatists, their tradi- 
tions, their prestige, and their fame. How that 
inheritance has been handed down to our own 
time may be illustrated by the following quo- 
tation from M. Sarcey : " Do you know that 
between Got and Moliere there are only seven 
or eight names of great actors ? We have, so 
to speak, only to stretch out our hand to be 
able, across several generations, to find the first 
Mascarille. Got played a long time with Mon- 
rose, who had seen Dazincourt. Dazincourt 
appeared young by the side of Preville, already 
old. Preville had known Poisson, who is the 
last link of the chain up to Moliere. In this 
way the tradition has been preserved alive from 
one great actor to another." Now and then an 
innovation has been made in the interpretation 
of some character of the classical drama ; when 
such an innovation has won the approval of 
the judicious, it has been adopted, and has fur- 
nished the starting-point for a new tradition. 

During the century or more that followed its 
foundation, the Comedie-Fran^aise occupied 
many homes the Palais-Royal, the Tuileries, 
the Odeon, and others. It was at the Odeon 
that the Revolution overtook the players, inter- 
rupted their activities, and threw them for a 
time into prison. When they were released, 
they took possession of the building in the Rue 
Richelieu that they have occupied ever since, 
and assumed the name of Theatre- Fran9ais 
changed temporarily, in order to follow the 
fashion of the hour, to Theatre de la Repub- 
lique. Into the building thus occupied, the 
lares and penates of the historical organization 
were gathered, and the collection of works of art 
and historical records has continued to accumu- 
late ever since. It is this collection, together 
with the venerable building which housed it, 
which was in great measure destroyed the 
other day, to the irreparable loss of mankind. 

It is only when one thinks of all that the 
Comedie-Fran9aise has meant for the history 
of dramatic art that one can realize what is 
meant by the destruction of the material em- 
bodiments of that history. With this institu- 



tion are inseparably interwoven the seventeenth- 
century glories of Moliere, Corneille, and Ra- 
cine, the eighteenth-century triumphs of Mari- 
vaux, Voltaire, and Beaumarchais, the nine- 
teenth-century renown of Hugo, Dumas, and 
Augier. Nor does the roll of its great actors 
evanescent though the fame of the player be, as 
compared with that of the writer sound in 
our modern ears with a greatly inferior rever- 
beration. Talma, Mars, and Rachel are still 
names with which to conjure, and we doubt not 
that a century hence such names as Got, 
Coquelin, and Bernhardt will be something 
more than dead memories of a forgotten past. 
Mr. Brander Matthews, in the following ima- 
ginary comparison, gives us some notion of 
what an institution like the Comedie-Fran^aise 
must mean to the national consciousness of a 
people : " To find any parallel for the career 
of the Comedie-Fran<jaise in our language and 
literature we should have to rely on the imag- 
ination. If the Globe Theatre had been worth- 
ily maintained from Shakespeare's death until 
now ; if the best works of Shirley and Congreve 
and Farquhar and Sheridan and Goldsmith had 
been written for it; if Barton Booth and Gar- 
rick and Siddons and Kemble and Kean had 
appeared on its stage; if our memory connected 
it with every masterpiece of dramatic writing 
and acting then we might form some idea of 
the position held in Paris by the Comedie- 
Fran9aise." Some idea, yes, but even then a 
very inadequate one, for the drama, in spite of 
the great Elizabethans, is not nearly as import- 
ant a part of our literature as it is of the 
French, and by just that difference would our 
imaginary Comedie- Anglaise fall short of being 
what its real French prototype has been and 
will continue to be, even amid its strange new 
twentieth-century surroundings. 

The foreign sojourner in Paris, if possessed 
of the capacity for enjoying the finer sort of 
art, has always found his way upon an early 
occasion to the House of Moliere in the Rue 
de Richelieu. He may have gone to other 
play-houses as a matter of curiosity, but for 
steady enjoyment he has soon settled down to 
the Fran9ais, and, however few his Parisian 
evenings, he has, if well-advised, spent the 
greater number of them at the one place where 
the fine fleur of French civilization is at its 
best. Mr. Henry James has written charm- 
ingly of the charm of the place, " the charm 
that one never ceases to feel, however often 
one may sit beneath the classic, dusky dome." 
What he writes is so exactly expressive of the

feelings of everyone who is susceptible to the 
more subtle forms of artistic appeal that we 
may fitly reproduce his further reflections upon 
the subject : " The Theatre-Fran cais has had 
the good fortune to be able to allow its tradi- 
tions to accumulate. They have been pre- 
served, transmitted, respected, cherished, un- 
til at last they form the very atmosphere, the 
vital air, of the establishment. A stranger 
feels their superior influence the first time he 
sees the great curtain go up ; he feels that he 
is in a theatre that is not as other theatres are. 
It is not only better, it is different. It has a 
peculiar affection something consecrated, 
historical, academic. This impression is deli- 
cious, and he watches the performance in a 
sort of tranquil ecstasy. Never has he seen 
anything so smooth and harmonious, so artis- 
tic and complete. He has heard all his life 
of attention to detail, and now, for the first 
time, he sees something that deserves that 
name. He sees dramatic effort refined to a 
point with which the English stage is unac- 
quainted. . . . He is in an ideal and exem- 
plary world a world that has managed to 
attain all the felicities that the world we live 
in misses. The people do the things that we 
should like to do ; they are gifted as we should 
like to be ; they have mastered the accom- 
plishments that we have had to give up." The 
contrast offered by this exhibition of dramatic 
art taken seriously to the best that the En- 
glishman or American sees upon the stage at 
home is very startling, and is, considered 
merely as an object lesson, of prime importance. 
The sensational devices of our own theatres, 
their tawdry decorations and their crude stage 
management, the poses and affectations of our 
actors, the reliance of our actresses upon the 
gowns which distract an audience from proper 
attention to the action all these things ap- 
pear in their true light after one has seen half 
a dozen performances in the famous French 
theatre. One used to think them highly ef- 
fective, knowing nothing better ; one now dis- 
covers that they appertain to a primitive form 
of art, and contemplates with dismay the pros- 
pect of returning home, and having to fall 
back upon them for theatrical entertainment. 
The experience is nothing less than a revela- 
tion, an opening- of eyes hitherto blind, and 
we may at least hope that when the revelation 
shall have come to a sufficient number of 
Americans, they may be able to create the de- 
mand requisite for the production and support 
of genuine dramatic art. Nor will this inspira- 



tion be lacking, despite the loss of the histori- 
cal play-house, for the spirit which made it 
what it has been must still survive, and we 
have no fear that the Comedie-FranQaise, in 
whatever new home it may select for itself, 
will fail to carry on into the coming century 
the high artistic ideals that it has upheld dur- 
ing the century now so nearly at an end. 



THE REALITY OF THE IDEAL. 

It seems paradoxical, yet it is true, that life shows 
wholly life-like only in the interpretations of art. 
Nor is it the forms and the manner, inaptly styled 
realistic, but rather the less circumstantial reports 
of ideal art, that reveal it thus fully. Let us select 
from this art any group of people, either from a 
novel, a dramatic poem, or a painting, and we shall 
find that they awaken a consciousness of life in us 
that is much wider than their own range of time 
and action. Suppose we take two perfectly familiar 
figures from the art which stands midway between 
the painting and the novel. What is it in the fig- 
ures of lago and Othello that makes them stand out 
in such splendid relief from the background of life 
and of the art that circumstantially repeats it ? No 
real people could give so full a report of the ener- 
gies that gather and play around these storm-centres 
of life, not even those whose measure would most 
nearly correspond to these heroic proportions. But 
would not the real people have the expression that 
belonged to the emotions and thoughts that were 
active within, and should we not be able to read 
what was going on there as well as, or better than, 
we can read it in the poem, or in any art expression 
that might be given it? Certainly not. No doubt 
the real people would show something of what they 
thought and felt, but not enough to overcome and 
dominate the impression of what was external and 
mere scenic effect. Even if by some altogether 
unlikely chance the circumstance should so perfectly 
fit the thoughts and feelings that were active, as to 
show all that they were, the natures which gave 
them exercise would be too limited in their capaci- 
ties to make them a revelation of life at large. 

It is only when art arranges and selects and 
shapes life, to make it fit some ideal conception 
thereof, that it shoves thus complete and whole. 
Our ideas of what life is are formed of many ex- 
periences and impressions. Memory saves from 
each some essential expression, and the rest becomes 
mere shadowy background or is quite forgotten. 
Out of the sum of these " survivals of the fittest " 
we get a general notion of how life would look if 
we could see it complete in any one of its expres- 
sions ; that is, if the imperfect, badly shaped, and 
fragmentary forms in which love and envy and de- 
sire and hate have appeared to us in life could be 
shown in forms that would compass all that they 



192

are. The art, then, whose forms are such as com- 
prehend fully, to its potential limits, the life that is 
its subject, will be more life-like than life itself, an 
interpreter and revealer of it even to those who 
know it best. 

But life-likeness in a work of art not only de- 
pends upon a conception and terms that comprehend 
the whole range of its kind of experiences, the work 
must be the expression as well of a mind working 
in a correspondingly comprehensive way. Its terms 
must not only release life from the narrow bounds 
of the actual, but they must also be the expression 
of artistic perceptions as wide in their range as that 
of the life out of which the conception has been 
formed. Now, perception and feeling reach both 
ways, and every state of mind and every act is de- 
termined by negative as well as by positive compul- 
sions. This needs not to be proved, for experience 
everywhere witnesses to it. It is shown in the equally 
imperative "do" and "do not" of every civil, 
moral, and religious code, in the divergent percep- 
tions and sentiments of good and evil that determine 
all conduct, in every fear that waits upon every 
hope, in every hope that waits upon every fear. 

A work of art, then, must be the product of the 
artist's perceptions and feelings, on both sides of 
his subject, if it is to be a full expression of his 
mind about it. In lago, evil shows all real and 
human, without a single incompetence or failure, as 
of pointed ear or cloven hoof, because a great ap- 
preciation of what he is not, worked together and 
equally with a great hatred and a clear intellectual 
perception of what he is, in creating him. Othello 
is thus completely convincing, because the mind 
that conceived his joy had an equal perception of 
the anguish that waited upon it, and the mind that 
conceived " the pity of it " conceived it in such 
moving terms because it realized the opposite po- 
tentialities of the soul with the same full and pas- 
sionate appreciation. The artist has here confessed 
himself, and in large, from limit to limit, disclosing 
the whole vast reach of his thought and feeling from 
the Olympian peak of his desire to the black depth 
which limits his perception of related evil. 

The ideal is thus the only real art, because it 
alone disengages life from its encumbrances, its ac- 
cidents of time and place and scene ; because it 
alone joins together the broken pieces that show in 
its single incidents and events, and presents them 
in an intelligible and organic whole. And not only 
by its fuller revelation of life is it more real than 
the art that is miscalled so, or even than life itself, 
but also because the spirit that has created it has 
infused a full measure of its own life into the ex- 
pression it has given the other. And, after all, it 
is this that has entered into it, this virtue, this pas- 
sion of the heart and brain that have conceived it, 
that makes it moving. This it is that, like the 
quiver in a voice, plays on the heart-strings. This 
is the breath of life, to its cold and perfect forms.

LiiGHT ON LINCOLN'S 



The distinctive value of Miss Tarbell's Life 
of Lincoln lies in the fact that it is to some 
extent based on independent research, and con- 
tains a considerable amount of new and inter- 
esting information. This information is the 
fruit of the systematic and extensive inquiries 
instituted in 1894 by the proprietors of " Mc- 
Clure's Magazine," with a view to securing, 
ere it was too late, such reminiscences of Lin- 
coln's then surviving contemporaries as were 
worth preserving. As the enterprise, aside from 
its commercial character, was rightly felt to be 
of a quasi-public nature, the public was asked 
to cooperate in it ; and the invitation was 
freely responded to. Hundreds of replies from 
all parts of the country were received, and a 
good deal of new and useful matter was se- 
cured. This matter was largely embodied in 
the two series of articles by Miss Tarbell which 
appeared in " McClure's Magazine" during the 
past five years, the first one covering Lincoln's 
life up to 1858, and the second one dealing with 
the later and more strictly historical phase of 
his career. Both series, in a revised and sup- 
plemented form, are published in the present 
volumes. 

Miss Tarbell's work has thus been largely 
one of compilation, and she has done it for the 
most part in a thorough and workmanlike way. 
She has given us a straightforward, plain nar- 
rative, copiously strewn with extracts and an- 
ecdotes, and free from rhetorical flourish or 
attributions of the Parson Weems variety. An 
appendix of some two hundred pages is devoted 
to a miscellaneous collection of hitherto unpub- 
lished speeches, letters, and telegrams, some of 
which are worth preservation, others, in our 
opinion, not. 

Let us hasten to say, however, that the new 
material presented by Miss Tarbell is, as she 
claims, of considerable value, and adds much 
to our knowledge of Lincoln's life. It is not 
a mere new budget of Lincoln stories tending 
to vulgarize one of the noblest figures in our 
history. It is time to have done with the no- 
tion that Abraham Lincoln was in the main a 
wag, a dry joker with an uncommon fund of 
" horse-sense," and a backwoodsman's boorish

contempt of learning and good manners. With 
all his humor, his not always delicate drollery, 
there was a vein of the profoundest melan- 
choly in Lincoln's nature. He loved mourn- 
ful poetry, and was haunted by mournful fan- 
cies. The pathos of life touched him deeply, 
the more so because his own days were full of 
it. He thirsted for learning, and prized it not 
alone as a means, but as an end in itself. How 
ardently he had pursued it his later mastery 
of language, of a singularly pure and impres- 
sive style, attests. 

Miss Tarbell endeavors to show that Lin- 
coln's mother was " not the nameless girl 
that she has been so generally believed," and 
that his father was in reality something more 
than a shiftless " poor white." Lincoln's biog- 
raphers, eager to enhance the in any case re- 
markable story of his rise from the log cabin 
to the White House, have perhaps overdrawn 
his humble parentage and early privations. 
Later researches tend to show that some in- 
justice has in this way been done to Thomas 
Lincoln, and especially to Nancy Hanks, who 
is now known to have come of good Massachu- 
setts stock, her more immediate ancestors pass- 
ing into Virginia (where the records show that 
they owned nearly a thousand acres of land), 
and thence into Kentucky, where they were 
useful and thrifty members of the young com- 
munity. On the death of her parents a home 
was found for Nancy Hanks, then nine years 
of age, with an uncle and aunt who had a farm 
near Springfield, where a number of her Vir- 
ginia relatives were living. 

Dr. Graham, an entertaining Kentucky cen- 
tenarian now living, describes the wedding of 
Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, and also 
the "infare" that followed it a Homeric 
marriage feast to which everybody was bidden, 
and of which Dr. Graham has, very naturally, 
a distinct remembrance. The " infare " was giv- 
en by the bride's guardian, John H. Parrott; 
and, says Dr. Graham, "only girls with money 
had guardians appointed by the court." Mr. 
Parrott's notions of an " infare" menu were 
liberal : 

"We had," says Dr. Graham, "bearmeat; . . . ven- 
ison; wild turkey and ducks; eggs, wild and tame, so 
common that you could buy them at two bits a bushel ; 
maple sugar, swung on a string, to bite off for coffee or 
whiskey; syrup in big gourds; peach-and-honey; a 
sheep that the two families barbecued whole over coals 
of wood burned in a pit, and covered with green boughs 
to keep the juice in; and a race for the whiskey bottle." 

The home to which Thomas Lincoln took his 
bride was a log cabin ; but at that date few 



families in Kentucky had anything better. 
That Lincoln's " credit was good," in a finan- 
cial sense, we have evidence, descendants of 
two of the early store-keepers of Hardin county 
still remembering charges against him in their 
grandfathers' account- books. Tools and gro- 
ceries were the chief purchases made, and on 
one of the ledgers the amazing item of " a pair 
of silk suspenders, worth one dollar and fifty 
cents " was entered. In 1816 Lincoln was ap- 
pointed a road surveyor, or supervisor ; and on 
the whole his position in Hardin county seems 
to have been better than he is usually credited 
with. In 1803 he moved to La Rue county ; and 
here his second child, Abraham Lincoln, was 
born. The new home, into which the well- 
starred little stranger came, was indeed the 
rude dwelling of the western pioneer a one- 
roomed cabin with a huge outside chimney, a 
single window, and a rough door ; but the stock 
descriptions of its comfortless squalor are over- 
drawn. The Lincolns lived roughly, but they 
lived happily, and as comfortably as most of 
their neighbors. 

In 1816 the Lincolns emigrated to Indiana; 
and here their home seems to have been much 
more primitive than it had been in Kentucky. 
The country was a wilderness, and land had to be 
cleared for the planting of the first crop. For a 
year the family lived in a " half-face camp." 

"The cabin which took the place of the 'half- face 
camp ' had but one room, with a loft above. For a long 
time there was no window, door, or floor; not even the 
traditional deer-skin hung before the exit ; there was 
no oiled paper over the opening for light ; there was no 
puncheon covering on the ground. The furniture was 
of their own manufacture. The table and chairs were 
of the rudest sort rough slabs of wood in which holes 
were bored and legs fitted in. ... Little Abraham's 
bed was even more primitive. He slept on a heap of 
dry leaves in the corner of the loft, to which he mount- 
ed by means of pegs driven into the wall." 

Those early pioneering days in Indiana were 
indeed, as Lincoln said, " pretty pinching 
times," darkened, too, by his first great sorrow ; 
for in 1818 Nancy Hanks Lincoln, " infare " 
doings and rose-hued " infare " prospects far 
enough behind her, laid down the burdens of 
her rough life ; and the boy saw his father nail 
together a green pine box and put his dead 
mother into it, and bury her not far from the 
cabin, " almost without a prayer." 

In the year following Thomas Lincoln went 
back to Kentucky, and presently returned with 
a new wife Sally Bush Johnston, a woman 
of energy, thrift, and gentleness, who took the 
motherless boy at once under her wing, and 



194

did her best to foster the gifts she saw were in 
him. 

" The new mother came well provided with household 
furniture, bringing many things unfamiliar to little 
Abraham one fine bureau, one table, one set of chairs, 
one large clothes-chest, cooking utensils, knives, forks, 
bedding, etc.' ... In his habits of reading and study 
the boy had little encouragement from his father, but 
his stepmother did all she could for him. Indeed, be- 
tween the two there soon grew up a relation of touching 
gentleness and confidence." 

The books that we know Lincoln read at 
this period were, the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress, 
2Esop's Fables, a History of the United States, 
Weems's Life of Washington, and, later, the 
Statutes of Indiana. Blackstone, too, came 
later, as did Burns and Shakespeare. There 
is a story that he read Plutarch ; but this he 
denied. Besides these works there were many 
others whose titles we do not know ; for Lin- 
coln used to say that he " read through every 
book he had ever heard of in that country for 
a circuit of fifty miles." As he read, he made 
extracts, sometimes on a smooth board in lieu 
of paper, with his turkey-buzzard quill and 
brier-root ink. 

" By night he read and worked as long as there was 
light, and he kept a book in the crack of the logs in 
his loft, to have it at hand at peep of day. . . . Every 
lull in his daily labor he used for reading, rarely going 
to his work without a book. When ploughing the 
fields of Spencer county, he found frequently a half 
hour for reading, for at the end of every long row the 
horse was allowed to rest, and Lincoln had his book 
out and was perched on a stump or fence, almost as 
soon as the horse had come to rest." 

Thus Abraham Lincoln began, through 
sheer force and probity of character, and over 
a path perhaps as rough as ever climbed by 
man, to work his way upward. But to say 
that he was a " self-made man," a man that 
" owed everything to himself," is to tell only 
half the truth ; for he was most richly en- 
dowed by Nature. Her gifts to him were lav- 
ish ; and he made the most of them. Much 
has been said, too, and with a certain truth, 
of Lincoln's " great simplicity of character "; 
but it must not be forgotten, on the other 
hand, that his homely ways and quaint ex- 
terior were mated with a political ambition 
and a political shrewdness almost unmatched 
in our history. But as man, as advocate, and 
as politician, he was, first, last, and always, 
" honest Abe." His right to that fine title can 
never be questioned. Of all American states- 
men his life best deserves to be read and laid 
to heart by American youth. It forms a story 
in which mirth and pathos are strangely 
mingled a story full of interest and golden 



lessons, and saturated with the distinctive 
spirit and character of our national life. Miss 
Tarbell has told it, on the whole, satisfactorily. 
Her book contains something that is new, and 
the essentials of the old. It aims to be biog- 
raphy rather than history to set before the 
reader as clearly as possibly the real Lincoln. 
The style is plain, and savors of journalism, as 
the origin of the work would lead one to ex- 
pect ; but it is clear and pithy. Evidences of 
hurried proof-reading there are, for example 
a curious omission at the foot of page 20, 
Vol. I. The volumes are well made and ac- 
ceptably illustrated ; but why, in the name of 
common sense and rational book-making, was 
that essential feature, an Index, omitted?

THE ENGLISH RADICALS.* 

No more readable historical monograph has 
appeared of late than Mr. Koy lance Kent's 
" The English Radicals." The author is aston- 
ishingly fertile in his characterization of the 
radical political leaders of varying periods, 
calling attention to and emphasizing differences 
not heretofore noted in their activities. This, 
with a keen analysis of radical platforms and 
principles, all excellently stated, makes the 
book exceedingly interesting, while the impres- 
sion of scholarship and research is maintained 
throughout. 

Mr. Kent traces the radical movement from 
its inception in 1761 to the present time. Un- 
usual fairness distinguishes the accounts of 
the earlier radicals, even when they were, like 
Wilkes, really inspired by sordid motives 
and given to disreputable political manosuvres. 
Though individuals may have been sordid, the 
radical party as a whole, according to Mr. 
Kent, possessed great intellectual ability and 
an honest fervor for democratic government, 
though somewhat lacking in political common 
sense and in practicality, and in these days of 
historical adulation for the men of action in 
details of government, it is refreshing to find 
an author who is not afraid to emphasize and 
eulogize the influence of great ideas, and of the 
men who consistently labored in their propaga- 
tion. 

The early radical was essentially an agitator 
and as such naturally devoted more attention 
to the benefits of an ideally perfect system than

to its practical workings. Yet the effort of the 
agitator in arousing the nation to a sense of 
danger is quite as essential as that of his more 
fortunate successor, the practical politician, 
who suffers none of the hardships and social 
disbarments of his forerunner, and commonly 
receives all the applause. Mr. Kent gives full 
credit to the men of ideas, for their honesty of 
purpose, their enthusiasm, and their sincere 
belief in the healing virtues of their plans. 

If the author is anywhere harsh it is in the 
comparison made, in the final chapter, between 
the purpose and attitude of the early radicals 
and the radicals of to-day. The early radical 
was a believer in the theory of " delegated " 
government, the modern rejects the theory 
though acting in indirect subservience to it ; 
Cobden and Bright deified individualism in 
government and in commerce, while the mod- 
ern radical is an adherent of socialistic pro- 
grammes in both. James Mill expressed the 
radical doctrine of his time very well when he 
observed that " the desire so often expressed 
that we should interfere to establish good gov- 
ernment all over the world is most alarming, 
and, if asserted to any degree, would lead to 
the worst of consequences. . . . The business 
of a nation is with its own affairs." The rad- 
icals of to-day, like their conservative oppo- 
nents, seem fully agreed that this an " outworn 
and unfashionable creed and that the white 
man has a burden which it is his duty to take 
up." But it is especially in the spirit of the 
old and new that the difference is most strik- 
ing. Of this Mr. Kent says : 

" It is rather in their traits, their character, their 
temperament and disposition that the new radicals con- 
trast so strongly with the old. The latter had at least 
some well-defined ideas. . . . They knew exactly what 
they wanted, and, knowing it, they pursued it with un- 
conquerable zeal. . . . They were no light half believ- 
ers of their casual creeds; the principles they held, they 
grasped with hooks of steel. They were men who sig- 
nified somewhat, as Cromwell would have said. If they 
held unpopular opinions they had the courage to avow 
them; . . . such firmness of conviction, such disinter- 
ested zeal, such limitless philanthropy, and such optim- 
ism, are at present far to seek. . . . Upon what princi- 
ple the new radicalism is now based, or what unity 
underlies the various items of its programme, it is dif- 
ficult to see. . . . Never before have the Radicals pre- 
sented so disorganized, so undisciplined a body." 

Whatever may be the opinion of the reader 
as to the justice of the author's conclusion, the 
book everywhere attracts and hold the interest. 
It has a good Index and abounds with foot- 
note references to authoritative sources.

MORE LETTERS OF THE MASTER OF 
BALL.IOL,.* 



The " Life and Letters of Benjamin Jowett," 
by Evelyn Abbott and Lewis Campbell, pub- 
lished in 1897, was widely welcomed by schol- 
ars and all thoughtful people who had come 
under the peculiar spell of the Master of 
Balliol. It was inevitable that a man who 
had lived at one of the centres of English 
thought and scholarship for the greater part 
of the nineteenth century, who had been on 
terms of intimate friendship with many of the 
leading men of his time, and who had pre- 
served an attitude of serene and fearless 
independence under some pretty sharp tests 
of this quality, should have left a fascinating 
accumulation of correspondence. And though 
Jowett, shortly before his death, burned all 
or nearly all of the letters he had received, 
the more precious half his own letters 
was found to be largely at the disposal of the 
editors. 

None knew better than Dr. Abbott and Dr. 
Campbell that they had not exhausted their 
treasure; and they have now given us the 
present volume, containing, to quote the Pre- 
face, 

" A number of letters, partly on special subjects, and 
partly of more general interest, which could not be in- 
cluded in the previous volumes, and yet seemed to be 
worth preserving ; and also some documents of a more 
public nature, which throw light on important features 
of Jowett's career." 

The letters are divided topically under five 
heads, as follows : I., Church Reform and the 
Abolition of Religious Tests ; II., Educational ; 
III., European Politics ; IV., Letters on India ; 
V., Miscellaneous. The arrangement under 
each head is of course chronological ; and a 
sixth division contains many of the Master's 
dated and undated notes and sayings which 
" live in the memory of his friends." 

The mere titles of these divisions forcibly 
suggest the varied intellectual powers of the 
man and the extraordinary range of his sym- 
pathies. In the battle for the abolition of 
religious tests at the universities, the smoke 
of which has now blown away, Jowett took an 
advanced and decided stand, which is too well 
known to need description here. When he was 
examined, in 1871, before a committee of

the House of Lords, he comprehensively said : 
" I should not bind a person by the obligation of a 
test. I should like to put before the Committee this 
consideration. Supposing you had one class of profes- 
sors bound by tests; for instance, supposing the Church 
of England Divinity professors were bound by tests, 
and other Divinity professors were not bound by tests, 
which do you suppose would have the greater authority 
and weight the persons who were free to speak what 
they thought, or the persons who were obliged to speak 
within a certain limit ? " 

In a precis which he drew up in 1874 for 
Lord Sherbrooke, he sums up the Non-con- 
formist situation with pungent equity : 

" The relation of the Church to the Dissenters, and 
of the Dissenters to the Church, is the greatest and 
worst schism in the Christian world. They divide the 
nation: these divisions affect all our politics, education, 
Church reform, etc. This division affects society, upper 
and middle classes, gentlemen and tradesmen ' See 
how these Christians ' look down upon one another or 
hate one another. The sense of injustice has passed 
into the blood and bone of one half of the people of 
England. They were driven out in 1661, and have 
never been restored." 

Jowett kept a watchful eye on European 
politics ; and his views are freely expressed in 
his letters to Sir R. B. D. Morier, attache at 
Berlin, and subsequently Ambassador to Rus- 
sia. From his position near the Prussian 
court Morier naturally reflected at any rate 
he quite understood the distrust which Prus- 
sia then (1861) felt toward Louis Napoleon ; 
and it is interesting and even amusing to note 
Jowett's attempts to convert his friend to his 
own strange admiration for " the man of des- 
tiny" and his "missions." In 1861 he writes 
to Morier : 

" How I should like to have a good talk about for- 
eign politics with you ! You know I was always a 
Napoleonist, as far as is consistent with being an 
Englishman. The way I come to it is this; the map 
of Europe is badly settled at present in accordance 
with traditions of Vienna, rights of petty German 
princes, etc. In the next twenty years it must be re- 
settled, and the only person who can lend a guiding 
hand in the resettlement is N. I have been very much 
struck with his Idees, which I read lately, and also 
with what one of the librarians of the British Museum 
told me, that for years he used to read there daily. He 
is not scrupulous, and perhaps his Court may be a mass 
of immorality and his Ministers dishonest jobbers, but 
he is the only man who sees the end many moves on, 
and understands not only France, but Europe and the 
times. . . . He will not fall into the error of his uncle 
of doing things too rapidly. And he has the best plan 
of all to have no plan." 

In July, 1870, the rush of events drew from 
Jowett this plaint, with "something of pro- 
phetic strain ": 

"The Emperor seems to have lost his head. I fear 



that this will be the end of his dynasty and the 
ruin of France. And I don't want to see him ruined, 
for he has been the best friend of England, and 
though on the whole my sympathies go with the 
Protestant power, yet we have need of both France and 
Prussia in Europe. These wars tend to make other 
wars, for although France may be too much weakened 
to continue, she will fight again as soon as she recovers 
her strength. The hatred of France to England from 
1815 to 1855 will be as nothing compared with her 
abiding hatred of Prussia." 

The letters on India are largely concerned 
with the educational requirements for the Civil 
Service. They are addressed to Lord Lans- 
downe (Viceroy from 1888 to 1893), Lord 
Salisbury, Sir M. E. Grant- Duff (the governor 
of Madras) and others; and deserve a more 
attentive reading than they will probably get 
in America : for they are marked by Jowett's 
best qualities perspicacity of statement, 
sound reasoning, and an ardent desire for the 
improvement of the service. 

The personal traits which made the Master 
of Balliol so beloved of his friends shine with 
special brightness in the miscellaneous letters 
to Tennyson, Stanley, Frances Power Cobbe, 
Professor Abbott, Professor Campbell, and 
others. From one of these it may be well to 
quote bis opinion of Matthew Arnold : 

"No one ever united so much kindness and light- 
heartedness with so much strength. He was the most 
sensible man of genius whom I have ever known and the 
most free from personality, and his mind was very far 
from being exhausted." 

The collection of aphoristic sayings with 
which the volume concludes is a mine from 
which various minds will dig out their own 
treasures ; here are a few we have taken at ran- 
dom : 

(Memory). "A man should make a compact with 
his memory, not to remember everything. Great 
memories, like that of Sir William Hamilton, are apt 
to disable judgment." 

(Rank) " I do not doubt that one day such dis- 
tinctions will vanish. While they remain, I wonder at 
any one not taking advantage of them." 

(Youth and Age). "I hope our young men will 
not grow into such dodgers as these old men are. I 
believe everything a young man says to me." 

(Christian Evidences). "The man who asks for 
demonstration must be either very ignorant or an utter 
sceptic." 

(The Limit of Scepticism) There must come a 

reaction towards religion again; the void will be too 
great." 

The book is, as intended, a welcome and 
almost necessary supplement to the " Life 
and Letters "; and those who have the one 
will want the other.

THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY.* 

How engaging a subject he lias found for 
his pen in his " The Great Company," Mr. 
Beckles Willson shows in the very paragraph, 
the last of his first chapter, in which he defines 
the aim and purpose of his book. 

" To narrate the causes which first led to the forma- 
tion of this Company, the contemporary interest it ex- 
cited, the thrilling adventures of its early servants, of 
the wars it waged with the French, and drove so 
valiantly to a victorious end ; its vicissitudes and grad- 
ual growth ; the fierce and bloody rivalries it combated 
and eventually overbore; its notable expeditions of 
research by land and sea; the character of the vast 
country it ruled and the Indians inhabiting it; and last 
but not least, the stirring and romantic experiences con- 
tained in the letters and journals of the Great Com- 
pany's factors and traders for a period of above two 
centuries, such will be the aim and purpose of this 
work." 

It is to be regretted that Mr. Willson has 
not done better justice to the importance and 
interest of a subject that he so well under- 
stands. He shows commendable diligence 
and application in the accumulation and pre- 
sentation of material that is at once interest- 
ing and valuable, but he does not show literary 
art, or even a good book-maker's skill. He 
does not handle his matter to good advan- 
tage. Sometimes he seems to miss the con- 
nection of events, and his narrative becomes 
confused and vexing to the reader. Some- 
times long quotations are introduced where a 
sentence or two of summary would answer a 
better purpose. Sometimes he goes into too 
much detail, and then again not into enough. 
Sometimes the sources of the narrative are 
given, and sometimes they are not. We do 
not blame him for not being a Parkman ; we 
do not say that his narrative is always heavy 
and slow ; but it does seem a pity that he 
should not have made a more effective use of the 
picturesque and romantic elements of his story. 
As to grammar and style, it would be easy to 
select from the 541 octavo pages enough bad 
examples to stock a couple of common school 
text-books, although we must admit that they 
would fall considerably short of the required 
variety. 

We cannot attempt to epitomize the long 
story that Mr. Willson tells, beginning with the 
schemes of the promoters those undaunted

adventurers Groselliers and Radisson, grace- 
less scamps, who were equally ready to ply 
their trade under the French and the English 
flags, and closing with the Great Com- 
pany's far more extensive but prosaic busi- 
ness of the present time. How much chro- 
nological territory is included is seen when we 
recall that the story fills the period from Prince 
Rupert, the dashing cavalry officer of the 
royal army in the civil war, who was the first 
President of the Company, to his present 
successor, Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, 
who is engaged just at present in fitting out 
in Canada a command of four hundred mounted 
men to fight the Boers in South Africa, all to 
be paid out of his share of the profits that the 
Company has made. 

Or, again, the scene opens with a single 
feeble trading post clinging to the shore of the 
great inland sea, then little known, which 
gives the Company its name ; it closes with the 
great and powerful organization that counts 
its well-established and well-furnished posts by 
scores, spread over the vast regions of the 
North, to which the picturesque name The 
Great Fur Land was once applied. Within 
the field of the Company's operations in the 
North there has been a great change since the 
latter part of the seventeenth century, but how 
small it is compared with the corresponding 
change in the outer world ! 

We shall quote three or four passages that 
will show the quality of the book at its best. 
Our first selections reveal the awful waste at- 
tending the maintenance of savage life in the 
far North. 

" The Indians were ruthless slaughterers of animals 
at the earliest period at which they were known to the 
servants of the Company. Whether they happened to 
be under the pinch of necessity or enjoying themselves 
in all the happiness of wealth and plenty, it was their 
custom to slay all they could. They boasted a maxim 
that the more they killed, the more they had to kill.' 
Such an opinion, although opposed to reason and to 
common sense, was clung to with great pertinacity by 
them. The results of this indiscrimate slaughter were 
obvious; and to such a pitch of destitution were the 
tribes often brought that cannibalism was not infrequent 
amongst them." 

" Throughout their progress [down the streams to 
the factories] the Indians were obliged to go ashore for 
several hours daily, which caused great delay in their 
progress. Their canoes were small, holding only two 
men and a pack of one hundred beaver skins, with not 
much room for provisions. Had their canoes been 
larger, their voyages would undoubtedly have been less 
protracted, and they would have been able to transport 
a greater cargo. Often great numbers of skins were 
left behind." 

" A good hunter of these nations could kill six hun- 



198

[March 16, 



dred beavers in the course of a season; he could carry 
down to the factory rarely more than one hundred, using 
the remainder at home in various ways. Sometimes he 
hung them upon branches of trees by way of votive 
offering upon the death of a child or near relation; 
often they were utilized as bedding and bed coverings; 
occasionally the fur was burnt off, and the beast roasted 
whole for food at banquets." 

What the poor savages got for the furs that 
they brought down to the shore in those times, 
this paragraph shows : 

"It was reported that in the year 1742 the natives 
were so discouraged in their trade with the Company 
that many found the peltry hardly worth the carriage, 
and the finest furs sold for very little. When the tribes 
came to the factory in June they found the goods much 
higher in price, and much in excess of the standard they 
were accustomed to. According to Joseph la France, 
a French-Canadian voyageur, they gave but a pound 
of gunpowder for four beavers, a fathom of tobacco for 
seven beavers, a pound of shot for one, an ell of coarse 
cloth for fifteen, a blanket for twelve, two fish-hooks or 
three flints for one, a gun for twenty-five, a pistol for 
ten; a common hat with white lace cost seven beavers, 
an ax four, a bill-hook one, a gallon of brandy four, a 
checkered shirt seven, all of which sold at a monstrous 
profit, even to two thousand per cent." 

First and last it is slight exaggeration to say 
that the fur trade in America, while conducted 
on a far smaller scale than the quest for gold, 
was marked by a selfishness and cruelty equally 
great. 

Here is our author's description of the mot- 
ley throng of humanity that the motives which 
carried on the fur trade in the palmy days of 
the Northwest Company brought together in 
the season on the farther shore of Lake Supe- 
rior, around the walls of Fort William. 

" But if the scene within was noisy and animated, 
that without beggared description. Hundreds of voy- 
ageurs, soldiers, Indians, and half-breeds were encamped 
together in the open, holding high revel. They hailed 
from all over the globe, England, Ireland, Scotland, 
France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, 
Switzerland, America, the African Gold Coast, the 
Sandwich Islands, Bengal, Canada, with Creoles, vari- 
ous tribes of Indians, and a mixed progeny of Bois 
Ernie's or half-breeds. ' Here,' cries one trader, ' were 
congregated on the shores of the inland sea, within the 
walls of Fort William, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, 
Methodists, Sun-worshippers, men from all parts of the 
world whose creeds were wide as poles asunder, united 
in one common object, and bowing down before the 
same idol.' " 

Among the interesting portions of the book 
are the accounts of the exploring expeditions 
conducted by Hearne and Mackenzie to the 
Arctic and to the Pacific oceans, and the Lord 
Selkirk episode. Mr. Willson's account of 
Mackenzie's expedition from Fort Chippewan 
to the Pacific in 1792-93 well illustrates that 
lack of definiteness which is one of the most 



serious blemishes of his book. He does not tell 
us where Mackenzie crossed the Rocky Moun- 
tains, or, having done so, by what route he 
made his way to the ocean. This is his account 
of the close of the expedition : 

" The navigation of the river, although interrupted 
by rapids and cascades, was continued until the 23d, 
when the party reached its mouth. Here the river was 
found to discharge itself by various smaller channels 
into the Pacific. 

" The memorable journey was now finished, and its 
purpose completed. In large characters, upon the sur- 
face of a rock under whose shelter the party had slept, 
their leader painted this simple memorial 

" ' Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada by land the 22d of 
July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three.' " 

We are left wholly in the dark as to the 
name of this river and as to the spot where 
the intrepid explorer painted his vermillion- 
colored memorial. Such indefiniteness as this 
in a work of this description is inexcusable. 
Still the author is entitled to the praise of 
having brought together in an accessible and 
readable form a vast amount of important in- 
formation relative to a great subject.

SOME CURRENT FALLACIES OF 
CAPTAIN MAHAN.* 

The proverbial failure of the sailor as an 
equestrian seems nowhere more lamentably ap- 
parent than in Captain Alfred T. Mahan's 
present pose as " the man on horseback." 
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson has 
had recent occasion to characterize his views 
as " the naval board of prize-money theory," 
and the recent collection of his papers in the 
volume called "Lessons of the War with Spain, 
and Other Articles " fails to show any higher 
notion of right than is held in the word might. 
Within the limits of his profession, which is 
the art of killing his fellows, Captain Mahan 
speaks with a certain authority ; upon matters 
of more general interest, he is performing at 
the present time an even more useful function 
as the outspoken advocate of 

" The good old rule, the simple plan : 

That those should take who have the power, 
And those should keep who can." 

Of " The Lessons of the War with Spain," 
accordingly, there is little to be said so far as 
the naval aspect of the case is concerned ; 
though such statements as this, " If we lost

ten thousand men, the country could replace 
them ; if we lost a battleship, it could not be 
replaced," ought to serve in illustrating the 
difference in morals between times of war and 
times of peace. 

But when we come to " The Moral Aspect 
of War," the second paper of the book, we 
find ourselves in the midst of an argument 
against peace so far as peace is bound up in 
the idea of arbitration, which shows that the 
writer is unable to think in any terms but 
those of war. He illustrates the injustice of 
arbitration, for example, by the admission, on 
disinterested authority, that the United States 
had no doctrine of international law behind its 
intervention in Cuba, and that a board of ar- 
bitration would have denied its right so to inter- 
vene. This is the preliminary statement he 
makes concerning the status ante bellum : 

"In the island of Cuba, a powerful military force, 
government it scarcely could be called, foreign to 
the island, was holding a small portion of it in enforced 
subjection, and was endeavoring, unsuccessfully, to re- 
duce the remainder. In pursuance of this attempt, 
measures were adopted that inflicted immense misery 
and death upon great numbers of the population. Such 
suffering is indeed attendant upon war; but it maybe 
stated as a fundamental principle of civilized war- 
fare that useless suffering is condemned." 

Captain Mahan proceeds to ask, "Under 
such circumstances, does any moral obligation 
lie upon a powerful neighboring state?" It 
is useless, perhaps, to point out that he begs 
the entire question when he introduces the 
word " powerful." For " Cuba " in the quo- 
tation substitute " Luzon," and ask, what is 
Japan's duty in the premises ? Evidently, if 
there is a principle behind Captain Mahan's 
doctrine, it is a mere question of Japan's 
ability to take Luzon away from us ; and on 
such principle as he here discloses, if Japan 
can, she ought. But regard this in the ser- 
ious light of being an argument against arbi- 
tration : that, rather than arbitrate, being 
powerful enough, we are to stop the slaughter 
of Cubans in order to place our citizens in a 
position where the lives of ten thousand of 
them are of less value than a battleship ; our 
army in the position of performing much such 
a service for the Filipinos as Spain had pre- 
viously been performing, and finally, to fly in 
the face of all international law, which has 
expressly reserved to nations the right to mind 
their own business in their own way. And 
all, as Captain Mahan points out, undisguis- 
edly, in the ultimate analysis for no better 
reason than because we had the power. What 



becomes of moral force in the face of the 
Captain's thirteen-inch guns ? 

From this he passes to " The Relations of the 
United States to their New Dependencies." 
Here we are to learn from England how to 
rule. Learn what from England? For one 
thing, " administration from without " in trop- 
ical regions. What have we learned from 
England in respect of the North American 
Indian ? " Since she lost what is now the 
United States, Great Britain has become be- 
nevolent and beneficent to her colonies," Cap- 
tain Mahan says in one place, and in another, 
" The task is novel to us ; we may make blund- 
ers." What, then are we to "lose" in order 
to become as benevolent and beneficent as, for 
example, England has been in South Africa or 
the Soudan ? We are not told ; but we may 
discover why it is that we should govern from 
without in the British manner, and the 
answer is worth recording, for Captain Mahan 
forgets the appeal to the national conscience 
and the God he has been invoking and says, 
baldly: 

" It is our interest. . . . Enlightened self-interest 
demands of us to recognize not merely, and in general, 
the imminence of the great question of the farther 
East, which is rising so rapidly before us, but also, 
specifically, the importance to us of a strong and bene- 
ficent occupation of adjacent territory." 

What do we gain ? The answer is ready: 

" The inhabitants may not return love for their bene- 
fits, comprehension or gratitude may fail them; but 
the sense of duty achieved, and the security of the ten- 
ure, are the reward of the ruler." 

And what do we lose ? 

Every principle dear to us : liberty, equality, 
taxation with representation, the consent of the 
governed, democracy, and the Constitution 
itself ! 

The book concludes with a paper upon 
" Current Fallacies upon Naval Subjects." 
Those whose memory goes back a few years 
will remember that it is upon Captain Mahan 
more than any other single person that the 
nation relied in its annexation of Hawaii. In 
1893 he began calling our attention to the 
fact that we must decide " Whether the Sand- 
wich Islands . . . shall in the future be an 
outpost of European civilization, or of the 
comparative barbarism in China," the Flowery 
Kingdom being about to send forth another 
Mongol horde armed with weapons of precis- 
ion and battleships galore for the purposes of 
his argument. Later we were informed of 
" The importance of the Hawaiian Islands as a position 
powerfully influencing the commercial and military

control of the Pacific, and especially of the northern 
Pacific, in which the United States, geographically, 
has the strongest right to assert herself." 

And to this was added the following significant 
sentence : 

" These are the main advantages, which can be termed 
positive : those, namely, which directly advance commer- 
cial security and naval control." 

With still later and stronger statements to the 
same end the naval historian buttressed his 
position, and to secure the naval control of the 
Pacific Hawaii was annexed, and our legis- 
lators are now devising some limitation of the 
franchise which shall not throw the islands 
into the hands of the Kanakas, or rightful 
owners thereof. But almost to our dismay, in 
this last paper, Americans are told that this 
was a current fallacy upon naval subjects in 
the following unmistakable language (p. 301) : 
"We now come to the assertion that if the United 
States takes to itself interests beyond the sea of 
which Hawaii is an instance, it not only adds to its 
liabilities, which is true, but incurs an unnecessary 
exposure, to guard against which we need no less than 
the greatest navy in the world." 

Since Admiral Mahan will not permit it, 
let us not forget, as is said above, that his pro- 
fession is the art of killing his fellows, and 
that he is far too eager professionally to dis- 
cern any of the possibilities of peace.

STATISTICS AND CENSUS-TAKING.* 

Professor Mayo-Smith's " Science of Sta- 
tistics," of which the volume entitled " Statis- 
tics and Sociology " appeared some four years 
ago, has now been completed by the publication 
of a second volume on " Statistics and Eco- 
nomics." The plan of this volume, though 
similar to that of the earlier one, is otherwise 
unique ; and it suggests a doubt whether there 
is after all a distinct science of statistics, or 
whether the so-called science is not simply a 
method of studying economics or sociology or 
some other division of knowledge. 

After an introductory chapter on " Statis- 
tics in the Service of Economics," various eco- 
nomic questions are treated under headings

which would serve equally well for a theoretical 
treatise in economics " Consumption and 
Production," "Exchange," and "Distribu- 
tion " for the main divisions, and such titles as 
" Money and Credit," " Wages," " Rent, In- 
terest, and Profits," for the chapter-headings. 
Each chapter begins with a brief statement 
of the economic theory of the topic to be con- 
sidered, and of the usefulness of the statis- 
tical method in that particular field ; then fol- 
lows an exhibition and critical examination of 
the more important statistical data pertinent 
thereto, with a bibliographical note telling 
where additional figures may be found. The 
methods of gathering and using the statistics 
of the subject are next subjected to certain 
" scientific tests " for the purpose of determin- 
ing which are the best methods ; and finally, 
there is a "reflective analysis" in which gen- 
eral conclusions are stated. This method of 
treatment makes the book valuable for several 
distinct purposes : it is a systematic treatise in 
descriptive economics, so far as the subject is 
capable of numerical treatment ; it deals in a 
judicious and scientific manner with statistical 
methods ; and the convenient arrangement and 
full index make it useful as a book of refer- 
ence, in which the leading facts on almost any 
economic topic may be found, not only for the 
United States, but also for some at least of 
the European countries. 

It will be helpful to many students to find 
how many economic problems there are to the 
solution of which the statistical method may 
be made to contribute. Among these there is 
none of more general interest than the problem 
of the distribution of wealth, which is, how- 
ever, one of the most difficult for the statisti-

be made of statistics of wages, rent, interest, 
and profits, and also of tax returns and other 
data indicating the distribution of incomes or 
of property. In all these ways Professor 
Mayo-Smith tests the assertion that the rich 
are growing richer and the poor poorer, and 
finds that the latter part of the statement at 
least seems to be unwarranted by the figures, 
which agree in showing that wages have been 
advancing during the past thirty to fifty years, 
while the cost of subsistence has been declin- 
ing ; but he adds the caution that certain other 
things must be taken into consideration, such 
as regularity of employment, duration and in- 
tensity of labor, the conditions under which 
it is carried on, and the method of payment. 
The available data on the distribution of in-

comes and property are even less conclusive; 
the author decides that they fail to show any 
marked concentration of income in the hands 
of a few, though there is undoubtedly very great 
inequality, now as in the past. But he argues 
that the concentration of wealth, either by the 
growth of private fortunes or by combination, 
is not altogether an evil, but on the contrary 
is absolutely necessary for the purpose of pro- 
duction on a large scale. The division of a 
large income among a number of persons 
would probably result in greater present enjoy- 
ment, but at the expense of future production, 
because less would be saved. 

" The institution of millionaires in the modern com- 
munity works somewhat like the institution of slavery 
in former times. It is a method by which all members 
of the community are, to a certain extent, compelled to 
save and economize and lay up capital." 

Finally, it is pointed out that remedies for too 
great concentration of power lie at hand in 
the formation of trades unions, benefit and 
cooperative societies, and other forms of asso- 
ciation which enable the laboring class to assert 
its power ; in factory, educational, and sanitary 
laws ; in the exercise of political power by 
the many; and in the furtherance of public 
opinion and Christian sympathy. 

The American Economic Association, at its 
meeting at Cleveland in 1897, authorized the 
appointment of a committee on the national 
census. The members appointed on this com- 
mittee were Professor Mayo-Smith, Professor 
Walter F. Willcox, Hon. Carroll D. Wright, 
Professor Roland P. Falkner, and Professor 
Davis R. Dewey. The committee called upon 
all the members of the Association for sugges- 
tions, and also invited a number of experts to 
prepare critical articles on particular parts of 
the Eleventh Census, for the purpose of sug- 
gesting possible improvements in the Twelfth. 
These papers have been collected and printed 
as one of the publications of the Association. 
They are twenty in number, not counting two 
letters which are printed at length among the 
briefer suggestions received from members. 
Various phases of population statistics are 
treated by Professor Willcox, Professor W. 
Z. Ripley, Professor Franz Boas, and Mr. 
George K. Holmes ; illiteracy and educational 
statistics, by Professor Dewey ; occupations, 
by Professor Mayo-Smith ; mortality statistics, 
by Mr. Cressy L. Wilbur and Professor Irving 
Fisher ; crime, by Professor Falkner ; pauper- 
ism and benevolence, by Professor Samuel M. 
Lindsay: agriculture, by Mr. N. I. Stone; 



farm and home proprietorship and mortgage 
indebtedness, by Professor David Kinley ; trans- 
portation, by Professor Emory R. Johnson 
and Dr. Walter E. Weyl; manufactures, by 
Mr. S. N. D. North, Mr. William M. Steuart, 
and Mr. Worthington C. Ford ; wage statistics, 
by Professor Charles J. Bullock; valuation and 
taxation, by Professor Carl C. Plehn ; muni- 
cipal finance, by Professor Henry B. Gardner ; 
while a general article on the scope and method 
of the census is contributed by Mr. William C. 
Hunt. The various papers are of very unequal 
merit, as is apt to be the case in a compilation 
of this kind ; but it is hardly necessary to say, 
after naming the contributors, that the volume 
contains much that is of value, not only to the 
Census Office, but to statistical workers every- 
where. The university professors may not in 
all cases fully recognize the practical difficul- 
ties confronting the census-taker, but they are 
able to point out defects from the standpoint 
of the consumers of statistics, and to suggest 
remedies. While their attitude toward the 
Eleventh Census is decidedly critical for the 
most part, they are not slow to recognize a 
particularly good piece of work, such as the 
inquiry concerning farms, homes, and mort- 
gages. In the report of the committee the 
opinion is expressed that the main defects of 
the census have been due to lack of sufficient 
time for preparation ; and the establishment of 
a permanent census bureau under civil service 
rules is proposed as the remedy. 

It should be a happy augury for the success 
of the Twelfth Census that several of the ex- 
perts who contributed to this critical volume 
are now connected with the Census Office in 
important capacities, so that they are in a posi- 
tion to prevent the repetition of the mistakes 
which have come to their notice. The inten- 
tion seems to be to have the work of the next 
census criticized before the results are pub- 
lished, and so far as possible even before the 
census is taken. For this purpose Professor 
Willcox has been put in charge of a Division 
of Methods and Results, and has gathered 
about him half a dozen student-clerks young 
men who have had university training in the 
use of statistics, and who are enabled to devote 
all their time to the careful study of statistical 
problems. In several of the government de- 
partments there is observable a similar tendency 
to put the statistical work more and more into- 
the hands either of university men or of others 
who combine the scientific attitude and breadth 
of view with practical experience in statistical

offices. If an improvement in the character 
of official statistics should follow, the credit 
will be due partly to the work of the Civil 
Service Commission, partly to the appointment 
of student-clerks, and partly to the publication 
of such works as the two which have just been 
reviewed. MAX 



THE RACES OF EUROPE.* 



Dr. Ripley has done a great service, both to 
general readers and anthropologists, in prepar- 
ing his work, " The Races of Europe." No- 
where are there more difficult ethnological 
questions than in Europe : nowhere is it more 
desirable to have clear ideas than in that field. 
True, much has been written regarding the 
physical anthropology of the Continent; the 
mass of literature on the subject is really appal- 
ling. But what has been written has been from 
the local standpoint. The race types of a state 
or governmental district have, in many cases, 
been worked out with wonderful care and pa- 
tience. But their relation to the types of other 
districts, the race types of the continent as a 
whole, these were questions which were but 
badly, if at all, answered. It was to present a 
.general view, to combine and correlate the 
local data so as to arrive at grander results, 
that our author has labored. 

Race is but one of the elements which has 
made European populations what they are to- 
day. Dr. Ripley states this plainly. Still the 
title of his book itself warrants our confining 
our review to that single element. " A type is 
a combination of characters." A race type 
should be a definite combination of characters, 
frequently recurring and persistent in time. 
To define types, characters must first be studied. 
Dr. Ripley bases his European race types upon 
three characters head form, color, stature. 
Heads are long and narrow or short and broad 
dolichocephalic or brachycephalic. Persons 
are blond or brunette light or dark in com- 
plexion, hair color, and eye color. They are 
tall or short. Having studied the range of va- 
riation within each of these three characters 
and investigated their distribution, our author 
works out three race types to which he gives 
the names Teutonic, Alpine, and Mediterra- 
nean. The Teutonic is dolichocephalic, blond,

supplementary volume .4 Selected Bibliography of the An- 
thropology and Ethnology of Europe. New York : D. Appleton

and tall; the Alpine is brachycephalic, bru- 
nette, and medium ; the Mediterranean is do- 
lichocephalic, dark, and short. In a general 
way the three types are geographically located, 
from North to South in the order named. 
Careful study of the populations of every part 
of Europe shows that any one of these types 
rarely exists alone. Usually two, sometimes 
all three, are found together sometimes sep- 
arate and approximately pure, but generally 
more or less mixed. Parts of Scandinavia are 
almost purely Teutonic ; most of Italy is Med- 
iterranean. In France all three of the types 
assist in making up the population. 

We cannot follow Professor Ripley's inter- 
esting discussion in detail. He investigates a 
variety of important historical, political, and 
sociological questions. Even from this brief 
review, it will be seen that his book is of great 
importance. It will greatly advance study. 
A pioneer work (from the present standpoint 
of science), it can hardly reach final conclu- 
sions on all points. To indicate the possible 
divergence from its conclusions, we may men- 
tion the work of Deniker, of Paris. This deals 
with the same subject and practically by the 
same method. Yet Deniker defines ten and 
not three European types. Later students 
will probably come to an agreement upon some 
intermediate number. 

Ripley considers his Mediterranean Race 
of African origin. He suggests that the Teu- 
tonic Race may have developed from it under 
the influence of a peculiar environment. The 
Alpine, he appears to think, is an Asiatic im- 
migrant which has wedged in between the 
other two. Whatever their origin, three such 
different physical types must differ in mental 
and moral characters. Each must affect, with 
its own peculiar color, the communities of which 
it forms a part or to which it has contributed 
by mixture. 

While, of necessity, Dr. Ripley's book is a 
compilation and claims to be no more, it is 
a compilation into which personality has so en- 
tered as to make it new matter. The author 
is especially to be praised for three important 
helps, which multiply many times the value of 
the simple text. These are the maps, the por- 
traits, and the bibliography. A series of inter- 
esting and instructive maps of Europe and the 
different countries of Europe show the geo- 
graphical distribution of race characters and 
race types. A collection of more than two 
hundred portraits present (a) typical charac- 
ters, (b) race types, (c) the types of each

of about two thousand titles directs the student 
to a vast, little known, and widely scattered 
literature. 

In remembering the excellence of his gen- 
eral idea, his diligence in carrying it into exe- 
cution, his ingenuity in devising and securing 
illustrative and graphic material, and his schol- 
arship in bibliographic work, we must forgive 
the author for frequently unhappy forms of 
statement and obscure expressions. 

FREDERICK STARR. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

An admirable Of recent text-books dealing with 
account of the English fiction, by far the most ser- 
Engiiih novel. yiceable we have seen is Mr. Wilbur 
L. Cross's "The Development of the English Novel" 
(Macmillan). This book should prove of interest 
and value to the general reader as well as to the 
student in this department of literature, for there 
is little to suggest the school-room in its plan or 
style. The headings of its eight chapters are : 
" From Arthurian Romance to Richardson," " The 
Eighteenth Century Realists," " From ' Humphrey 
Clinker ' to ' Waverley,' " " Nineteenth Century 
Romance," "The Realistic Reaction," "The Re- 
turn to Realism," " The Psychological Novel," " The 
Contemporary Novel." An appendix contains a 
list of twenty-five prose fictions designed to show in 
outline the development of the English novel and 
fourteen pages of useful bibliographical notes. 
There is an Index. In the details of his work, Mr. 
Cross puts forth no plea for any particular writer 
or school : " We are by nature both realists and 
idealists," he declares, " delighting in the long run 
about equally in the representation of life somewhat 
as it is and as it is dreamed to be. . . . Idealism 
in course of time falls into unendurable exorbitances ; 
realism likewise offends by its brutality and cyn- 
icism. And in either case there is a recoil." This 
is eminently sane, for it is true both in reason and 
in fact. The clash of rival schools in fiction, the 
petulance of their respective champions how ex- 
asperating ! Yet this absurdity is also natural and 
would better be regarded in humor than in anger. 
The analysis and classification of English fiction is 
no simple matter ; the diversities and the similari- 
ties are often so perplexingly contradictory that one 
finds his material capricious. The pigeon-holes are 
duly labeled, but some of the stories apparently be- 
long in half-a-dozen at once. The author of this 
book, however, approves himself a master of his 
subject, subservient to no theories of arbitrary as- 
sortment ; his frequent repetition of names and 
titles previously localized, in connection with groups 
which in some respects overlap the others, con- 
tributes directly to the clearness of the classifica- 



tion and supplies a series of links that emphasize 
the inter-relations and points of connection in the 
material as a whole. Among the many excellent 
features of the essay we note the occasional para- 
graphs upon the influences, social and political, for- 
eign as well as domestic, which always affect public 
taste and often account for the literary fashions of 
the day. In the characterization of the novelists 
we have been especially pleased with the sections 
upon Sterne, Jane Austen, Scott ("the greatest 
force that has yet appeared in English fiction ") r 
George Eliot, and Meredith. In his treatment of 
contemporary writers, Mr. Cross does Mrs. Hum- 
phry Ward scant courtesy, sparing never a word in 
comment upon her fine character creations and her 
excellent technique. It occurs to us that in a text- 
book of this nature, there should be included a 
section on technique ; a discussion of this topic 
treated historically would be of great service to the 
student of fiction. 

Recollections, by The P a g es of Sir Algernon West'8 
Mr. Gladstone's chatty volume of " Recollections : 
private secretary. 1 8 32-1886" (Harper) are thickly 
strewn with the names of men well known in En- 
glish political and official life during the period cov- 
ered. Sir Algernon's long career in the fiscal branch 
of the public service has kept him constantly in touch 
with public men, and furnished him with an un- 
usually large budget of stories about them, and these 
form the staple of his book. He was chosen Pri- 
vate Secretary to Mr. Gladstone on the latter's re- 
turn to power in 1868, and naturally has some 
rather interesting recollections of his old chief 
not a few of them comically tinged with the Private 
Secretary's proverbial self-importance. For exam- 
ple, he records: "... After the ceremony we 
all adjourned to luncheon at Mr. Gladstone's, who 
asked me whom I should propose as Chancellor of 
the Exchequer. I suggested Chamberlain, but he 
thought that the city would be terrified at his views 
of ' ransom,' while I maintained that a few weeks 
of official experience would soften the crudeness of 
his views." Sir William V. Harcourt received the 
appointment, and the ex-Secretary goes on to say : 
" On the llth I had my first interview with my 
new master (Sir William), who received me aux 
bras ouverts as his 'guide, philosopher, and friend.' " 
Lest the foregoing extracts should seem to argue a 
general lack of the sense of humor in Sir Algernon, 
we hasten to say that in point of fact his mind is 
on the contrary of a somewhat Joe Millerish cast, 
if we are to accept his book as a fair reflection of 
it. His stories are largely of the jocular order, 
and pleasantly reflect the foibles and humors of old 
official colleagues those of Mr. Alfred Montgom- 
ery, for instance, a witty but punctilious gentleman 
of the old school of manners, long Chairman of the 
Board of Inland Revenue. One baking hot day, 
Sir Algernon relates, the Chairman's private secre- 
tary rashly came into the board-room with his coat 
off. " Montgomery was much shocked, and as the

secretary was leaving the room he called him back 
and said : ' Mr. , if you should find it con- 
venient in this hot weather to take off your trousers, 
pray do not let any feeling of respect for the Board 
stand in your way.' " There is a touch of pathos, 
and an illustration of the ways of royalty, in the 
last recorded jest of this old public servant. As 
he lay on his death-bed the Prince of Wales called 
on him, and shortly afterwards the Princess. On 
her departure he said to his servant : " Should the 
Queen call, say that I am too tired to see her Maj- 
esty." " He once told me," Sir Algernon signifi- 
cantly adds, "that though he had been in the Queen's 
household since her Majesty's accession, she had 
never once spoken to him." To an Englishman, of 
course, the oversight was tragic. Sir Algernon's 
book makes pleasant reading, but it lacks pith, and 
conveys the impression that its author is a good 
deal of a trifler which of course he is not, outside 
literature. There are some good illustrations, 
mainly portraits, and the volume is attractively 
made. 

There was abundant room for a

and their world. . 

The reader who is confined to En- 
glish works has had nothing outside the encyclo- 
paedias that was not untrustworthy and antiquated. 
He may now turn to the two large and sumptuous 
volumes that Professor Justin H. Smith has just 
devoted to " The Troubadours at Home " (Putnam), 
which are certainly neither meagre nor ill-informed. 
Indeed they present a vast mass of facts gleaned 
from a wide study of the best and most recent in- 
vestigations and from a considerable acquaintance 
at first hand with the poetry of the troubadours 
themselves. Something may be found here con- 
cerning more than a hundred of the upwards of 
four hundred singers known to us, and very full 
information concerning all the most important ones. 
Emphasis is justly laid on the interest that the lit- 
erature of the troubadours should have for us as 
containing the beginnings of our own culture, and the 
attempt is made to present the social and intellect- 
ual movement of which it is the expression, and to 
make more intelligible to the modern reader the 
spirit, the ideas, and the ideals of that forgotten 
world. To that end attention is also given to the 
exterior aspects and customs of the time. The 
troubadour country has been carefully studied, and 
the character of its scenery and the appearance of 
its towns impressed upon the reader, not only by 
highly colored word-pictures, but also by a great 
wealth of fine illustrations from the author's own 
photographs. This is frankly an ceuvre de vulga- 
risation, and even the method of historical fiction is 
not disdained in order " to constitute an environ- 
ment and an atmosphere for the poets," and to in- 
duce with regard to " the life, the events, the local- 
ities and the personalities " of the time " a sense of 
actuality." But in spite of these painstaking efforts 
and these elaborate means, we lay down the vol- 



umes with a measure of disappointment. The 
world of the troubadours has not risen clear, firm, 
coherent, and substantial in our minds. Somehow 
it still remains shadowy, distant, and unreal. Its 
parts are left too scattered, our gaze is too often 
distracted from it to this world of modernity, and 
the rising illusion of reality is too often rudely dis- 
pelled by the instrusion of the author with his 
Baedeker and his camera. Perhaps, as so often 
happens, he would have succeeded in doing more if 
he had been content to attempt less. We really 
have three works here : a beautifully illustrated 
book of travel, a historical novel, or rather a score 
of them, and a work of literary history. Each 
one would gain immensely by being cut loose from 
the others. However, the author's failure to 
achieve all the ends that he proposed to himself by 
no means robs his work of its solid value ; it pre- 
sents by far the most ample and trustworthy store 
of information about the troubadours and their 
world to be found in English. The fulness of its 
bibliographical references will make it of service 
even to special students. 

A stimulation " Literature is largely made in the

study of Milton. great f unct i on o f literature, namely 

to bring into play the spiritual faculties, is very 
inadequately recognized, and the study of En- 
glish literature is made too much an objective 
job the fault of teachers, not students." There 
are many readers who would promptly assign 
these words to Professor Hiram Corson without 
being explicitly informed of their source, so fre- 
quently and so insistently has this veteran cham- 
pion of the true interests of literary instruction ex- 
pressed the idea which they embody. As a matter 
of fact, they are taken from the preface to Dr. 
Corson's latest work, "An Introduction to the 
Prose and Poetical Works of John Milton " (Mac- 
millan). Nor are the following words any less 
distinctively characteristic of the author's controll- 
ing ideas upon the subject of literature-study: 
"Notes are a necessary evil, and should not 
be read until after a requisite general impression 
has been received from an independent reading; 
often two or more independent readings should 
precede any attention to explanatory notes. . . . 
A special attention to the details should be given 
only after the reader has, in a general way, taken 
in the articulating thought and the informing life 
of the poem." Such words as these cannot be 
said too often, and deserve to be printed in letters 
of gold. The aim of the work before us is to en- 
courage students in such a study of Milton as shall 
bring them into vivifying spiritual contact with 
the loftiest of English poets. It has two main sec- 
tions. The first, called " Milton's Autobiography," 
consists of about a hundred pages of text, "made 
up of all the more important autobiographical 
passages contained in his prose and poetical works," 
and arranged chronologically with reference to his 



1900.]

life. The second section consists of "passages in 
Milton's prose and poetical works in which his 
idea of true liberty, individual, domestic, civil, pol- 
itical, and religious, is explicitly set forth." Here 
we have the whole of " Comus," " Lycidas," and 
" Samson Agonistes," besides some score of pages 
of brief extracts. To state the plan of this work, 
together with the name of its editor, is to commend 
it to all who love English literature, and believe in 
its enormous possibilities as an educative influence. 
Of Milton, particularly, in these days of the glo- 
rification of brute force and the wide departure of 
the English peoples from the ideals that have made 
them great, we may well repeat the familiar cry of 
Wordsworth's sonnet, and welcome any attempt to 
create a renewed interest in one whose only care 
was " To stand approved in sight of God, though 
worlds judged [him] perverse." 

The life of James Hogg offers to its 
Thereat biographers one difficulty or, per- 

Eltnck Shepherd. . & , r / 

haps better, an opportunity that is 
unique in the history of literature. Hogg became 
widely known, not merely by his own writings or 
his own personality, but also by the character given 
him by others in a work of fiction. Indeed, we 
rather think that Hogg was even in his life-time 
known as the Ettrick Shepherd of the " Noctes 
Ambrosianae " more widely than as the author of 
" Kilmeny." Or, in other words, Hogg even in his 
lifetime was known, not merely as he could present 
himself to the public but as the none too scrupulous 
Wilson, or sometimes Lockhart, chose to present 
him. This is certainly a strange predicament. We 
think of no analogy save that of Socrates, and he 
was in his lifetime known personally and not as he 
appears in the Dialogues of Plato. This curious 
double character of Hogg is fully appreciated by 
Sir George Douglas, who has just written the vol- 
ume devoted to him in the " Famous Scots " series 
(imported by Scribner). Professor Ferrier, who 
edited the " Noctes," was of the opinion that Hogg 
would be better known to posterity in the character 
given him by Wilson than in his own. Sir George 
naturally holds to the facts ; he decidedly prefers 
" the simple, kindly, unsophisticated farmer of 
Yarrow as he stands ' in his rights of a man,' ow- 
ing nothing to art, his imperfections on his head " 
to " the sham Arcadian, the fatuous amorist of 
his own eloquence, the maudlin retailer of tirades 
ad libitum over whisky-punch at a tavern." We 
incline to agree with him, and to differ with Pro- 
fessor Ferrier as to posterity, which now does not 
know much or care much about the " Noctes Am- 
brosianae." Whether it knows or cares much more 
for the work of James Hogg may be a question. 
But those who read this sketch of the poet's life 
will probably feel some desire to turn for a moment 
to the work of one of the most typical of Scotch 
poets. It should be added that the volume includes 
also short sketches of Tannahill, Motherwell, and 
Thorn. 



In "The Peasant's War in Germany" 
The Peasants War. (Macmillan), Mr. E. Belfast Bax 

furnishes the second of his series of 
three volumes on the social side of the German 
reformation. The period is a difficult one to cover 
owing to the lack of unity in the various separated 
revolutionary movements, and to their having oc- 
curred at nearly the same time. The details of 
each rising are narrated with careful discrimination 
between fact and tradition. Occasional digressions, 
suggested by the events of his period, on the phil- 
osophy of socialistic movements in general, and on 
the scope of modern socialism in particular, seem 
rather forced, and mar the general excellence of 
the author's work. A sharp contrast is justly drawn 
between the essential spirit of the reformation, and 
the objects sought by the peasant's war. The re- 
formation was wholly individualistic and modern 
in its tendency, while the material purposes of the 
peasants were communistic and mediaeval, and were 
therefore doomed to failure in the end. Yet the 
wrongs of the peasants were not to be borne quietly, 
and whatever their mistaken remedies, the peasant's 
war, per se, says Mr. Bax, was a laudable effort 
against unjust conditions. The author's impartial- 
ity in treating of the relations of peasants and 
princes, both before and during the war, is note- 
worthy, even when emphasizing the inherent right- 
fulness of the peasant's cause. Unfortunately this 
same equitable balance is not consistently main- 
tained in the references made to the position of the 
Lutheran theologians toward the peasant move- 
ment. The bare mention of their names brings with 
it epithets of bitterness and scorn, while Melancthon 
in particular is designated successively as " malig- 
nant toady," " Luther's little dog," and " Luther's 
jackal." Whatever Mr. Bax's opinion of these 
men, the use of such terms is certainly not dignified, 
and most sensibly detracts from the impression of 
scholarly impartiality otherwise received. A minor 
criticism from the scholar's point of view is that 
while we find in the preface a list of authorities, no 
specific references to them are anywhere made. 
Nor is there an index, though it may be the inten- 
tion to supply this for the entire series, in the third 
and concluding volume, on the Anabaptists, now 
in preparation. An excellent map of Germany 
during the reformation (from Spruner-Menke's 
Historlscher Atlos) has been included.

author considers, in a chapter apiece, the social 
status of the stage, the stage as an artistic career, 
the necessary qualifications, the best training, dra- 
matic schools and teachers, and the lights and shad- 
ows of the life. His experience as a dramatic 
critic has brought him into close relations with the 
stage, and it is by no means a rose-hued picture he 
has drawn of the qualifications and training essen- 
tial to success. The question of dramatic art 
that is to say, of movement in a play and of com- 
petent execution and acting of it is, of course, 
distinct from the question of morals; but, since 
morality, either positive or negative, is inherently 
present in everything, moral quality never permits 
itself to be ignored. As a corollary Mr. Hubert 
maintains that the actor or actress cannot hold his 
or her own in society that the stage leaves its 
mark. There is a light vein of animosity in this 
broad statement. The question of character should 
enter more fully into the discussion " it is the 
root of the flower, and the flower is as the root 
makes it."

othermenof thought. &on , R U8 ki n , Mill, and Other Liter- 
ary Estimates " (Macmillan). He describes it as 
"a series of systematic estimates of some leading 
influences on the thought of our time." Be- 
sides the three men named in the title, Arnold, 
Symonds, Lamb, Keats, Gibbon, Froude, and Free- 
man are made the subjects of Mr. Harrison's crit- 
ical examination. We have, besides, a paper on 
" English Prose," and a semi-satirical dialogue 
called " The Book-Trotter." To those familiar with 
Mr. Harrison's literary characteristics and phil- 
osophical method these titles alone will convey a 
fair idea of what the book contains. Such readers, 
at least, will know beforehand that the discussion 
will be animated and interesting, filled with fine 
enthusiasm, and couched in a style burly rather 
than delicate, yet expressive of much good sense and 
warm sympathy with most worthy matters. The 
touchstone of Comte is applied now and then, as a 
matter of course, and the author's familiar habit is 
practiced of massing his praise and dispraise in 
separate formations. The essay on Tennyson is 
probably more imperfect in its sympathies than 
any of the others, while the three papers on Raskin 
exhibit Mr. Harrison's temper and acumen at their 
best. The book as a whole, which is well worth 
reading, seems to occupy a sort of half-way station 
between criticism of the kind that endures and 
criticism that is of the day and year only.

government with a zeal that has left all Americans 
his debtors. Like all Germans of his time, he 
attached himself to the party of Hamilton and 
Marshall-: in itself a sufficient answer to those who 
had detected signs of revolution in him, and the 
interesting development of his mind toward the 
more popular forms of American political philoso- 
phy in later years is almost the only omission in the 
present volume of which complaint can be made. 
To the American legist and jurist he stands in the 
light of a pioneer, reducing broad areas of cultivable 
soil to tillage which, until his coming, had been 
covered with wild growths. To the student world 
of his time he was almost a prophet, so well organ- 
ized and so interesting was the combination of 
knowledge and wisdom he imparted to his classes. 
To the political sphere of his day he appeared as a 
seer, and many of his theories even now suggest the 
idea of illumination. The book in hand is admir- 
ably designed and written, from the frontispiece of 
the great scholar to the Index. 

A record and After a chapter or so of biography 
review of proper, Mr. Charles Hiatt's attract- 

Sir Henry Irving. iyely mounte( j book on Henry Irving 

(Macmillan) gradually resolves itself into a series 
of appreciations of that great actor's art as exem- 
plified in his leading roles. The text is liberally 
strewn with well-chosen extracts from journalistic 
criticisms of Mr. Irving's impersonations so lib- 
erally, indeed, that the book serves as a moderate 
anthology in that kind ; and it should be observed 
that though Mr. Hiatt is a warm admirer of his 
hero he has by no means confined himself to quota- 
tions of a laudatory character. It has been his aim 
to give a concise account of Sir Henry's career on 
the sta^e from the time of his first appearance at 
Sunderland in 1856 down to the recent production 
of "Robespierre," and at the same time to faithfully 
illustrate what critics have said pro and con of his 
work. The opinions of Mr. Clement Scott and 
Mr. William Archer will accordingly be found side 
by side with those of Mr. Joseph Knight and Mr. 
A. B. Walkley. Some interesting facts as to Sir 
Henry's childhood and youth are supplied in the 
opening chapters, and a full list of parts played by 
him in London, with dates of first performances, is 
appended. The book is copiously and handsomely 
illustrated, mainly with portraits one of which, 
by-the-way, after an early original, so closely re- 
sembles R. L. Stevenson that it might easily pass 
for a rather flattering likeness of that author. Some 
interesting reprints of play-bills of the chief produc- 
tions at the Lyceum will be found useful to students 
of the stage. The tasteful exterior of Mr. Hiatt's 
readable book calls for special mention.

of 



Of the band of self-devoted men 



an Anti-Slavery and women who were chiefly instru- 
mental in awakening the national 
conscience to a sense of the degradation involved in 
slaveholding, few remain. One of the youngest of 
the number, Aaron Macy Powell, survives now only 
in the memory of a very few associates, and in the 
" Personal Reminiscences of the Anti-Slavery and 
other Reforms and Reformers " which he had pre- 
pared and is now published by his devoted widow, 
Mrs. Anna Rice Powell. The book is one to be 
read especially by any timid souls who in these 
later days fear to speak out on the unpopular side 
of great questions affecting the honor and well- 
being of the nation. It is the temperate and accu- 
rate statement of a man who was yet in early man- 
hood when he saw Garrison, known to him first as 
a target for unmerchantable eggs and unmention- 
able abuse, the honored guest of the nation at the 
raising of the Stars and Stripes over Fort Sumter 
in April, 1865. From anti-slavery, at the close of 
the war, Powell passed to other agitations for re- 
form to the demand for equal political and other 
rights between the sexes, and for many other prob- 
lems which are yet awaiting settlement. The book 
concludes with contributions, in prose and verse, 
from several hands, to the sterling qualities of this 
energetic reformer and valuable citizen. 

A myiberop Following his " Myths and Legends 

from our (t New of Our Own Land" comes Mr. C. 
M. Skinner's supplementary volume, 
uniform in size and shape, entitled " Myths and 
Legends of Our New Possessions" (Lippincott), 
including in the latter category Puerto Rico, Cuba, 
Hawaii, and the Philippines, but omitting Guam. 
It is from Hawaii that most of the real legends are 
derived, though the isolated instance from Samoa, 
where an American newspaper man, ten years ab- 
sent, has been erected into a tutelary war-god 
an eminence for which so many American journals 
have been striving in vain is brought forward to 
prove what a savage imagination can do in the face 
of Christianity. The stories of Spain are, almost 
without exception, slight romances on familiar lines, 
such as must have been known in the peninsula 
before being transplanted to the islands of the east- 
ern or western sea. All are entertaining, and form 
a treasure-house for future writers. 



The dozen rollicking but not over- 

Kxperiences of an j i ,. i t i i ..i 

Irish magistrate, drawn sketches of rural life in the 
west of Ireland, collectively entitled 
"Some Experiences of an Irish R. M." (Long- 
mans), are reprinted from the " Badminton Maga- 
zine," and they are well worth it. There is a note 
of genuineness in the book, despite its element of 
fiction, that we like. The stories are supposed to 
be told by a newly settled Resident Magistrate, 
who gradually becomes used to the ways of his 
horse-dealing, fox-hunting, hard-drinking, and by 
no means unlikable neighbors. The types and cus- 



toms of the region are delineated with much humor, 
and the leading characters and their fortunes, mari- 
tal and other, are carried on through the several 
chapters. The authors are Messrs. E. Somerville 
and Martin Ross, and Mr. Somerville furnishes 
some acceptable drawings. 



Pepys's ghost in 
modern Gotham 
and elsewhere. 



"Pepys's Ghost" (Badger) is the 
title of an amusing skit in which the 
style and mental idiosyncrasy of the 
prattling old diarist are cleverly parodied by Mr. 
Edwin Emerson, Jr. The book is quaintly de- 
scribed as, " His Wanderings in Greater Gotham, 
his Adventures in the Spanish War, together with 
his Minor Exploits in the Field of Love and 
Fashion, and his Thoughts Thereon. Now recy- 
phered and here set down, with many annotations." 
Mr. Emerson, in the guise of Pepys revisiting the 
glimpses of the moon, journalizes in Pepysian phrase 
and fashion some every-day up-to-date experiences 
in New York, and also some actual adventures of 
his own as press correspondent at the front during 
the Spanish War. Mr. Emerson evidently knows 
his Pepys, and his book is bright and entertaining 
and not too big. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch, in his " Historical Tales 
from Shakespeare " (Scribner^, does for the " histories " 
something like what was done by the Lambs for the 
other plays; that is, he tells in simple language the 
stories of the historical plays. A book of similar scope, 
although of different plan, is " The Story of English 
Kings According to Shakespeare " (Appleton), by Mr. 
J. J. Burns. This book, designed especially for school 
reading, pieces together characteristic extracts from 
the historical plays, and supplies easy narrative for con- 
nective purposes. The idea is a good one, and well 
carried into execution. 

Mr. Nicholas Browse Trist, the well-known whist 
expert, has written a small volume on " American Leads 
and Their History," which has been published by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. The work consists of (1) a his- 
tory of the American leads, (2) a critique of later 
American innovations (in which such vagaries as the 
11 Street attachment " and the methods of the " short- 
suiters " are sharply scored), and (3) a synopsis of the 
approved Anglo-American leads. We recommend the 
book to all devotees of the noble game with which it is 
concerned. Mr. Trist has a pleasing style and a con- 
vincing manner of exposition. 

"The Age of Johnson," by Mr. Thomas Seccombe, is 
a volume in the series of " Handbooks of English Lit- 
erature " (Macmillan), of which Professor Hales is the 
general editor. The series now comprises six volumes, 
covering the period from 1632 to 1870, and forming as 
a whole one of the best histories of modern English lit- 
erature that have thus far been produced. Milton, 
Dryden, Pope, Johnson, Wordsworth, and Tennyson, 
give their respective names to the volumes now pub- 
lished, and other volumes for the earlier ages are soon 
to appear. Mr. Seccombe has performed his task with

[March 16, 



taste and discernment. His period is the latter half of 
the eighteenth century, and he boldly claims for it the 
inclusion of more great names than any other " Age " 
thus far dealt with in the series. 

" Choral Songs by Various Writers and Composers 
in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria " (Macmil- 
lan) is a sumptuous vellum-encased folio containing 
thirteen compositions. The writers include such men 
as Messrs. Robert Bridges, A. C. Benson, John Davidson, 
Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, and F. W. H. Myers. 
Among the composers we note the best-known of En- 
glish academic names, Sir A. C. Mackenzie, Sir Hubert 
Parry, Sir John Stainer, and Mr. C. V. Stanford. The 
authors of the work join in a dignified dedication to the 
Queen, recalling the fact that a work similar in intent, 
" The Triumphs of Oriana," was published in 1601 in 
praise of Elizabeth. 

Mr. Henry Frowde has just published " The Oxford 
Moliere " in three forms. The first of these is a single 
volume of 647 double-columned pages. The second is 
exactly like the first, except that it is printed on India 
paper, and sold at a higher price. The third is in the 
prettiest imaginable set of four vest-pocket volumes, 
printed on India paper. The text and typography are 
the same in all these editions; the latter is necessarily 
rather minute, the former is taken from the standard 
edition of MM. Despois and Mesnard. There is not a 
single word of English in any of these books. We 
trust that the Oxford Press may see its way to publish 
similar editions of other foreign classics. " Don Quijote" 
might properly come next in the series. 

Mr. David Nutt has begun the publication of a series 
of " Popular Studies in Mythology, Romance, and Folk- 
lore." The numbers take the form of sixpenny pam- 
phlets, of which four have thus far been issued, as fol- 
lows: "Celtic and Mediaeval Romance," by Mr. Alfred 
Nutt; "Folklore: What Is It, and What Is the Good 
of It ? " by Mr. E. S. Hartlund ; " Ossian and the Os- 
sianic Literature," by Mr. Alfred Nutt; and "King 
Arthur and His Knights," by Miss Jessie L. Westou. 
These are engaging little books, and none the less schol- 
arly because of their popularizing intent. 

The plan of Messrs. Macmillan's new " Library of En- 
glish Classics" is to reproduce, in typographically per- 
fect reprints, the best existing texts of the masterpieces 
of English literature, with no fresh editorial material 
other than a brief bibliographical note to each volume 
from the pen of Mr. A. W. Pollard. Bacon's Essays 
and Sheridan's Plays inaugurate the series, and form 
two octavo volumes of handsome and dignified outward 
appearance, and irreproachable typography. We 
trust this commendable enterprise may extend indefi- 
nitely beyond the twenty-five volumes planned for 
publication during the present year. 

Mrs. Sara T. D. Robinson, the widow of the late 
Governor Robinson, has issued, through the Lawrence 
Journal Company, a new edition of her "Kansas: Its 
Interior and Exterior Life." The book was written 
when Mrs. Robinson was with her husband in the Le- 
compton prison, and was first published in October of 
1856. It ran rapidly through nine editions and exerted 
an important influence upon Northern opinion at the 
time. Its present interest lies wholly in the fact that 
it presents an account of important events, written by 
an eye-witness at the time of their occurrence. It is 
therefore unfortunate that Mrs. Robinson has in this 
edition interpolated a good many paragraphs, without 
distinguishing the new from the old. 



NOTES. 

Messrs. Eaton & Co. are the publishers of a " History 
of the United States," by Miss Alma Holman Bar- 
ton. It is a text-book for school children of the younger 
sort. 

The " Old South Leaflets " enter upon their second 
century of numbers with "The Rights of War and 
Peace," a translation of the Prolegomena to the great 
work of Grotius. 

" A Manual of Zoology," by Messrs. T. Jeffrey Parker 
and William A. Haswell, is published by the Macmillan 
Co. in an American edition with special adaptations and 
illustrative material. 

The publishers of Mrs. Barr's " Trinity Bells," Messrs. 
J. F. Taylor & Co., announce that the book has just 
gone into a third edition. Its success has been due 
largely to its exceptional fitness for young girls' reading. 

The two closing volumes for 1899 of the series of 
" Economic Studies " (Macmillan) are " The English 
Income Tax," by Dr. Joseph A. Hill, and " The Effects 
of Recent Changes in Monetary Standards upon the 
Distribution of Wealth," by Mr. Francis S. Kinder. 

A unique addition to the numerous reprints of "The 
Compleat Angler " is the India paper " Thumb " edi- 
tion, published by the Oxford University Press. The 
volume is about two inches square, and although con- 
taining 600 pages of text is less than half an inch 
thick. 

The publishers of Mr. Stedman's long-deferred 
" American Anthology " state that owing to the editor's 
continued illness it has been found possible to issue only 
the limited large -paper edition of the work this Spring, 
publication of the regular trade edition being post- 
poned until Fall. 

" Glimpses across the Sea," by Mr. Sam T. Clover, is 
published at Evanston, 111., by the Windiknowe Pub- 
lishing Co. It is a pleasant volume of sketches of 
travel in Europe, enlivened by humor and shrewd ob- 
servation. The contents are reprinted from the " Even- 
ing Post" of Chicago. 

" Outlines of the Comparative Physiology and Mor- 
phology of Animals," by Professor Joseph Le Conte, is 
a text- book just published by the Messrs. Appleton. It 
presents a general view of its subject rather than that 
study of selected types that has found favor of late, and 
that many educators believe to have been overdone. 

By degrees the writings of Edward Rowland Sill are 
trickling into the light of the more permanent publicity 
that appertains to books as distinguished from period- 
icals. Three small volumes of his verse have been put 
forth, and now Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. an- 
nounce a volume of his prose and letters for early pub- 
lication. 

In connection with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. of 
London, the Macmillan Co. will shortly begin the 
publication of a series of international primers forming 
a Primer-Cyclopaedia. The aim is to provide in a con- 
venient and accessible form the information which 
the usual bulky and high priced encyclopaedias place 
beyond the easy reach of the average reader. The 
series will accordingly aim at the comprehensive in- 
clusion of the chief department of Literature, Science 
and Art, and each volume will be the work of a spec- 
ialist on the subject treated. 

Recent English texts and supplementary reading 
books include the following: Irving's "The Alhambra,"

edited by Mr. A. M. Hitchcock; Scott's " Marmion," 
edited by Mr. George B. Aiton; and Lowell's "Sir 
Launfal " and other poems, edited by Mr. Herbert 
Bates. These three are published by the Macmillau Co. 
From the Messrs. Appleton we have " Stories from the 
Arabian Nights," selected by Mr. Adam Singleton. The 
American Book Co. sends us " South America," a geo- 
graphical reader by Mr. F. G. Carpenter; "A Tale of 
Two Cities," edited by Miss Ella Boyce Kirk; and " The 
Talisman," edited by Miss Julia M. Dewey. 

Dante's " Paradiso " is a new " Temple " classic which, 
like the recent edition of the " Laxdale Saga," indicates 
a purpose on the part of the editor to enlarge the scope 
of this series of books beyond what have heretofore 
been its limits. The little volume contains the text of 
the " Paradiso " faced by Mr. Wicksteed's prose trans- 
lation. Each canto is supplied with an argument and 
notes, the contribution of Messrs. Wicksteed and Oels- 
ner. There are also given the necessary maps and 
charts. No announcement is made of similar editions 
of the other two cantiche, but the demand for them is 
likely to be such as to force their preparation. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish " A Practical 
Treatise on French Model Auxiliaries," by Dr. Alfred 
Hennequin; "French Prose of the XVII. Century," 
edited by Prof. F. M. Warren; " Scenes de la Re* vo- 
lution Franchise " from Lamartiue's " Girondins," 
edited by Professor O. B. Super ; and Moliere's " Las 
Pre'cieuses Ridicules," edited by Professor Walter 
D. Toy. An edition of the last-named play, edited 
by Dr. C. Fontaine, is also sent us by Mr. W. R. 
Jenkins. " French Reading for Beginners," edited 
by Professor Oscar Kuhns, is published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. The American Book Co. publish 
an abridgment of " La Tulipe Noire," by Alexandre 
Dumas, made and edited by Professor Edgar E. Bran- 
don. 

The International Association for the Advancement 
of Science, Art and Education is an organization that 
was projected last September, when the British and 
French Associations for the advancement of Science 
held their meetings at Dover and Boulogne, respec- 
tively. Special committees were appointed under the 
general presidency of M. Le"on Bourgeois. It is plan- 
ned to hold an International Assembly in Paris during 
the summer of the Exposition, in connection with the 
comprehensive scheme of Congresses which will be in 
Paris, as it was in Chicago, an important adjunct to 
the work of the Exposition. As Secretary of the 
British contingent of the Committee in charge, Professor 
Patrick Geddes is now in the United States for the 
purpose of securing the cooperation of our scientific 
and educational forces in the prosecution of this im- 
portant and altogether praiseworthy undertaking. In 
a general way, it may be said that the Assembly will 
aim to secure to those who take advantage of its ar- 
rangements the fullest benefits of the Exposition, and 
of its auxiliary congresses. Provision will be made 
for classes, lectures, expert guidance, excursions, and 
social gatherings, whichshould greatly enhance the profit 
of American students in Paris during the coming sum- 
mer. The energy and contagious enthusiasm of Pro- 
fessor Geddes are such that his present mission is sure 
to be productive of good results, and we cordially in- 
vite those interested in the matter to put themselves 
into communication with him. He may be addressed 
at any time in care of the United States Commissioner 
of Education. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS. 

THE DIAL'S annual Spring Announcement List, pre- 
sented herewith, is considerably larger than any previ- 
ous list of the kind that we have yet given our readers 
at this time of year. Over 700 titles are included, as 
against 600 a year ago. It is not intended to name in 
this list any books already issued and entered in our 
regular List of New Books; and all the books here given 
are presumably new books new editions not being in- 
cluded unless having new form or matter. The list 
presents, therefore, a real survey of the new and forth- 
coming books of the Spring of 1900, carefully classified, 
and compiled from authentic data.

A NEW BOOK. 

UNDER ORDERS; 

Or, Not His Own Master. 

BY 

Mrs. Q. S. REANEY. 

A story of thrilling adventure and heroism, drawn 
from the great treasure-house of such scenes modern 
missionary enterprise. It shows anew, that missionary 
truth is stranger and more exciting than the old time 
fiction of adventure. The leading character is a hero 
in many senses, for he not only braves the dangers of 
Tierra del Fuego, but he gives up the girl he loves, 
when she makes it a question of choice between her and 
the call of the Master. In the end he gains more than 
he has lost, for he wins her back, a devoted woman, by 
his heroic example. The English surroundings of the 
" home " features of the story, give it a quaint and 
pleasant setting which will be attractive to readers on 
this side of the water.

Competition was not very marked, and cus- 
tomers received little attention; but with the 
advance of civilization came the demands for 
better methods. In no line has the evolution 
been so great as that of bookselling. From 
the old time-honored dingy shop, with its 
high shelves, has developed the modern book- 
shop, with its glass cases, convenient arrange- 
ments, and abundance of light. From a very 
limited class of book-buyers we have broadened 
out into an intelligent, book-loving and book- 
reading nation, and to meet the wants of 
thousands of book-buyers, to whom a good 
book-shop is inaccessible, the system of 

Selling Books by Mail 

Has been established. To this class of read- 
ers we offer our services, together with one 
of the best equipped book-shops in Chicago.

SHAKSPER NOT SHAKESPEARE. 

By WILLIAM H. EDWARDS author of "Voyage on the River Amazon," 
" The Butterflies of North America," etc. 12mo, cloth . . $2.00 
Shakesper not Shakespeare, that is, that William Shaksper was not 
the writer of the Shakespeare poems and plays. Not only does Mr. 
Edwards hold that Shaksper was unequal to the composition of any 
one of the poems or plays, but he denies that he ever acquired the 
manual art of writing, even to the extent of signing his own name. 
The text is accompanied by many fac-similes and illustrations. The 
book is the result of many years' patient investigation, and the argu- 
ment is based on the testimonies of the highest Shakespearean author- 
ities, Halliwell-Phillipps, Dre. Ingleby and Furnivall. Fleay, and others. 
Who did write the plays is outside the plan of this book, and no light 
is thrown in that direction ; but the 519 pages are full of testimonies 
from the great Shakespearean scholars destructive of any claim of 
authorship set up for William Shaksper, of Stratford.

EAST TENNESSEE AND THE CIVIL WAR. 

By Hon. O. O. TEMPLE, author of " The Covenanter, the Cavalier, and 

the Puritan." 1 vol., 8vo net $3.50 

"This volume will, we believe, be accorded a place among the most 
important, original, and interesting contributions to American history. 
While written in the dispassionate and impartial tone of a jurist, the 
narrative rises to an interest that is stirring and thrilling. The work 
has the quality which gave immortality to the Anabasis of Xenophon 
and the Commentaries of Caesar the author writes from the vantage 
ground of a participant and an eye-witness." The Interior. 

A REVIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 
UNITED STATES.

"The work, which is written in plain, terse English, avoiding all

recommend it as a valuable aid in arriving at correct conclusions on 
many disputed constitutional questions." The Albany (N. Y.) Law

" One of the most remarkable volumes of poetry published in America 
for many years. . . . Mr. Q-uthrie's theme is loftily ideal and his treat- 
ment is thoroughly unique. His use of new and free metrical forms is 
inspiringly bold and some of his lyric work strikes us as being masterly 
in rhythmic execution. With regard to the external appearance, it is 
distinctly the handsomest volume we have seen of late, and a credit to 
American art. " The Churchman.

224 THE DIAL [March 16, 




By HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ, author of " Quo Vadis." Two Volumes. 
Illustrated, $2.00; or in One Volume, 853 pages, $1.00. 

The works of Sienkiewicz and Dumas have frequently been compared. They have both written historical 
romances complete in themselves and yet in which the same characters made their appearance in several success- 
ive volumes bearing different titles. When we decided to issue "Knights of the Cross" we believed that either 
the conclusion had been reached, and such announcement purposely omitted, or else that we might expect it to 
continue for an indefinite period. 

When the death of a heroine is recorded, either the end is reached or the hero must undergo a further series 
of adventure. In other words, to make an artistic success of a romance sufficient time must elapse ere the hero 
be permitted to make a second serious conquest of the heart or succumb to the inevitable, if the lady say him nay. 

It was only while the book was on the press that we learned that more was to follow, but inasmuch as a 
complete romance was given the reader, we felt that we were justified in issuing the book as it was, and our 
opinion is confirmed by the perfect satisfaction our edition has given to the thousands of purchasers of Dr. Sam- 
uel A. Binion's translation. Our edition must of necessity have been translated from the Polish, as the complete- 
ness of our edition clearly demonstrates that not sufficient time has elapsed for us to make the translation from 
the Russian edition. 

Messrs. Gebethner & Wolff of Warsaw, the publishers of all the books of Sienkiewicz, did sell in Decem- 
ber, 1898, in separate form, the early parts of the " Knights of the Cross," and in December of 1899, all of the 
parts then ready. This accords with our previous announcement and with their own advertisement in an " Illus- 
trated Polish Weekly." 

We cheerfully challenge comparison with Dr. Binion's scholarly translation.

THE BEST EDITION OF 



JOHN RUSKIN'S WORKS 

Illustrated Cabinet Edition in 26 Volumes 



JOHN RUSKIN stands, without a peer, the most eloquent and original of all writers on 
nature, art, and architecture in the world. As a writer of beautiful English, too, his 
" Sesame and Lilies," " Mornings in Florence," etc., have long been recognized as master- 
pieces. No previous edition of Kuskin has fully met the requirements of exacting book lovers ; 
the Illustrated Cabinet Edition, we believe, will. 

Printed from beautiful, clear type, well spaced with indented side notes, on deckle-edge, 
soft laid paper, equal to the finest hand-made as far as results in printing are concerned, and 
producing a volume light in weight. 

The full-page illustrations number 288, and include all the colored plates, steel engravings, 
etchings, and process cuts, in all the original tilts. In addition to the full-page illustrations 
are the cuts in the text many hundreds of them altogether. A large proportion of these are 
from drawings by Mr. Kuskin, and are not only attractive in appearance, but are absolutely 
necessary for a proper interpretation of the text. 

The volumes are bound with flat backs and uncut edges, gilt tops, in a handsome cloth, 
with an especially appropriate full gold back design. Size, a tall 12mo. 

The works will be sold in complete sets or separately as follows at $1.50 per. volume.

" Mr. Lawrence is to be congratulated upon his book, which has its value enhanced

SPRING ANNOUNCEMENTS 



The Campaign of the Jungle; 

Or, Under Lawton through Luzon. 

Being the Fifth Volume of the Old Glory " Series. 

By EDWARD STRATEMEYER. Illustrated. Cloth, 

medallion cover, 316 pages, $1.25. 
The story has a truthful and graphic historical set- 
ting in two expeditions of the noble General Lawton, 
whose portrait adorns the cover, the first being that 
directed against Santa Cruz on the Laguna de Bay, and 
the second from Manila to San Isidro, through one 
hundred and fifty miles of jungle. Each book of the 
famed " Old Glory " series seems to gain in interest 
upon its predecessors, and its progress has been an un- 
broken triumph of the worthy presentation of such 
reading as active boys need and will have. 

Andy Dodge. 

The History of a Scapegrace. 

By MARK PIERCE PENDLETON. Cloth, gilt top, 

portrait, $1.25. 

This is a distinctively American novel by a well- 
known journalist who draws his characters with a free, 
strong hand. It is praised by William Dean Howells 
for its honest work and fidelity to truth, and tells with 
fine realism the scrapes, struggles, and ultimate success 
of a so-called " wild " youth, who is, at the same time, 
able, manly, and American to the backbone. 



Discovery of a Lost Trail. 

By CHARLES B. NEWCOMB, author of "All's Right 
with the World." Cloth, $1.50. 
" Discovery of a Lost Trail " is a simple study of 
that strange and beautiful thing that we call life, but 
grand in its scholarly simplicity. In the words of the 
author, " plain suggestions of confidence, patience, glad- 
ness, and decision often bring us back to the trail we 
I have lost through the uncertainty of our own power 
and freedom." 

The Pastor's Helper. 

A Complete Ritual for the Various Duties 
Connected with his Office. 

Arranged for the Baptist, Congregational, Metho- 
dist Episcopal, Unitarian, and Universalist denom- 
inations. By Rev. N. T. WHITAKER, D.D. Full 
leather, flexible covers, gilt edges, $1.50 ; cloth, 
flexible covers, red edges, $1.00. 
The distinctive forms for the several denomina- 
tions named can be relied on as being those fully 
authorized, and include forms for marriage, funeral 
and baptismal services, together with forms for the 
ordinance of the Lord's Supper and reception of mem- 
bers, also all church letters, including transfer of mem- 
bership, license to preach, and letters missive. The 
book concludes with an admirably complete digest of 
parliamentary law.

By MARY JOHNSTON, author of " Prisoners of Hope." 

Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

The New York Times Saturday Review says : 

" There is nothing/ possible but unstinted praise for a book of qualities as unique as they 
are admirable. Original in plot, thrilling in its situations, strong and sweet in its char- 
acter drawing, vital with noble emotion, perfect in style, To Have and to Hold ' compels 
a breathless interest from its first page to its last, and is remembered as one remembers an 
uplifting vision of the mountains or the salt breath of the sea." 

The New Orleans States declares : 

" In her sterling new novel, ' To Have and to Hold,' Mary Johnston has quite met the 
anticipations of those who were charmed with the grace and captivated by the strength of 
her rarely beautiful 'Prisoners of Hope.' . . . It is so distinctly in a class of its own. so 
picturesque and chaste, so replete with life and color, that it is one of those novels which 
one would readily lose a night's rest to complete, once he found himself enmeshed in the 
delights of its pages." 

The Baltimore Sun observes : 

" The plot is strikingly original and dramatic, and the story is told with extraordinary 
power." _

ROBERT HERRICK, A.B., 

Assistant Professor of English, University 

of Chicago, and 

LINDSAY TODD DAMON, A.B., 
Instructor in English, University of Chicago. 

EMBODIES THE MOST RECENTLY ACCEPTED METHOD OF 
ENGLISH TEACHING IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 

" What has struck me especially is the freshness 
and directness with which it appeals to the average 
school-boy and school-girl. It attacks the problem 
of writing as they have to cope with it, talks the 
plain and vigorous common sense which they are 
likely to appreciate, and offers illustrations which 
are often striking and always directly to the point. 
It gets at the student in a way most Rhetorics fail 
to do." HERBERT VAUGHAN ABBOTT, Dfpartment 
of English, Horace Mann School, New York City. 

" My examination of Herrick and Damon's Com- 
position resulted in our putting it into the High 
School. I am glad to add that the user of it, a 
graduate of the University of Michigan and gradu- 
ate student of the Universities of Chicago and Cal- 
ifornia, tells nit to-day that the book is highly sat- 
isfactory. It seems to be the best book, taken all 
in all, that we have found." W. SCOTT THOMAS, 
Supt. City Schools, Petaluma, California.

Synopsis for Review. Copies will be mailed

It gives in as simple a manner as possible the " elements " of French. The process of selection has been carried on 
with extreme care in order to eliminate only tbose things not essential, and at the same time to avoid complexity of details 
and dryness of technicality, while giving all the technicality necessary to understand the mechanism of the language. 

It has already been adopted by the Northwestern University, Evanston. 111., the University of Vermont, Burlington, 
Vt.. Illinois College, Jacksonville, 111., Wesleyan Female College, Macon, Ga., Ripon College, Wis., Ann Arbor, Mich.,

THE ARTIST AND THE MAN. 

Among the many principles for which the 
late John Raskin contended with all the force 
of his impassioned and vehement eloquence, 
there is one which occupies a peculiarly signi- 
ficant position. It is the principle that a man's 
art and a man's character are so mutually de- 
pendent that the latter is implicit in the former. 
This principle is central in the great critic's 
doctrine, for it supplies the nexus whereby his 
ethics and his esthetics become united into a 
single body of teaching. It affords the justi- 
fication fpr his constant injection of moral ques- 
tions into his discussions of art, and for his 
persistent employment of artistic illustrative 
material in his treatment of the problems that 
relate to the conduct of life. The principle in 
question finds its typical expression in such 
sentences as these : " The faults of a work of 
art are the faults of its workman, and its vir- 
tues his virtues." " Great art is the expression 
of the mind of a great man, and mean art, that 
of the want of mind of a weak man." " And 
always, from the least to the greatest, as the 
made thing is good or bad, so is the maker of 
it." " When once you have learned how to spell 
those most precious of all legends, pictures 
and buildings, you may read the characters 
of men, and of nations, in their art, as in a 
mirror; nay, as in a microscope, and mag- 
nified a hundredfold ; for the character becomes 
passionate in the art, and intensifies itself in all 
its noblest or meanest delights." Finally, the 
doctrine of these pronouncements receives 
summing-up in the following impressive fash- 
ion : " Of all facts concerning art, this is the 
one most necessary to be known, that, while 
manufacture is the work of hands only, art is 
the work of the whole spirit of man ; and as 
that spirit is, so is the deed o'f it ; and by what- 
ever power of vice or virtue any art is produced, 
the same vice or virtue it reproduces and 
teaches." 

There are many impulsive sayings to be 
found in the forty or fifty volumes of Ruskin, 
many opinions too clearly born of a moment's 
intellectual caprice to be deserving of more 
than a moment's attention, but these which we 
have quoted do not belong to that category. 
They are rather the deliberate records of a life-

THE DIAL, 



[April 1, 



long belief, time and time again solemnly re- 
affirmed, and fundamental to a comprehension 
of the whole structure of their author's thought. 
That the proposition which they embody has 
been vigorously denied is matter of common 
intelligence among those familiar with the cur- 
rents of critical discussion during the past half- 
century or more. The doctrine of " art for 
art's sake " falls to pieces unless we reject the 
notion that the character of the artist is re- 
flected in his work. That doctrine has exerted 
a strong influence upon criticism, and there was 
a time, not so many years ago, when it seemed 
to hold the field against its opponents. If we 
consider the case of literary art alone, there 
were two excellent reasons for the apparent 
ascendancy of this opinion in the forum of 
aesthetical controversy. The first was offered 
by the fact that didacticism in literature had 
been greatly overdone. When we think of the 
long and dreary annals of allegorical composi- 
tion and sermonizing in verse, we naturally 
revolt from the assumption that this sort of 
activity has anything to do with literature 
proper, and it gives us a sense of satisfaction 
to take refuge in even the extreme opinion that 
poetry has no business to teach anything, that 
its message is that of pure beauty, and that, by 
just so much as it departs from this aim, its 
purpose becomes weakened, and its spiritual 
power impaired. The second reason which 
seemed to justify the principle of " art for art's 
sake " was offered by those over-zealous critics 
of literature who were constantly dragging 
petty personalities into their work, raising a 
great pother over the superficial aspects of a 
poet's private life, and making out of some 
carelessness of habit or fault of temper a struc- 
tural defect in character which must always be 
kept in the foreground of thought when the 
poet's work was under consideration. It was 
no wonder that these two influences combined 
drove many sensitive intelligences to the ex- 
treme of revolt. The fact that, on the one 
hand, such didacticism as Young's " Night 
Thoughts" and Pollok's "Course of Time" 
could pass for poetry at all, and that, on the 
other, whole sections of the reading public 
should be warned against the poetry of Byron 
and Shelley because their lives did not square 
with the social conventions of their time 
this twofold fact, we say, based upon a false 
perspective and a complete misunderstanding 
of the poetic art, was amply sufficient to ac- 
count for the success of a form of teaching 
whose fundamental object was to restore to 



poetry the dignity which it seemed to be in 
danger of losing. 

When, however, we come to take a broader 
view of the whole question, it must be admitted 
that the doctrine of " art for art's sake," the 
doctrine that the artist must deliberately es- 
chew the intention of teaching, that, if he have 
the divine fire within him, the purity of its 
glow will remain undimmed whatever the life 
he may lead, is almost as narrow as the doc- 
trine against which it was raised in protest. 
Because certain dull poets have been offen- 
sively didactic we have no right to say that 
poets of genius may not engage their powers 
in the furtherance of worthy ideals. That 
some great poets have had personal failings, 
about which their critics have been more curious 
than was necessary, is no reason why we should 
deny that, other things being equal, the blame- 
less life will in the long run express itself in 
nobler forms than the life that has not escaped 
" the contagion of the world's slow stain." As 
far as the latter of these two propositions is 
concerned, we take a just pride in the thought 
that Milton and Tennyson were no less great 
as men than as poets, and, while giving full 
acceptance as poetry to the work of men whose 
character we may not call unblemished, it 
would distinctly add to our satisfaction could 
we know them to have lived lives in stricter 
consonance with their ideals. As for the for- 
mer proposition, we need only point to the long 
line of great poets who have allied their work 
with the practical human causes of religious 
and ethical teaching, of political and social 
progress. From the defence of the Areopagus 
and the old conservative order by .^Eschylus to 
the denunciation by Hugo of the saturnalia of 
a bastard French imperialism, the most famous 
of poets have ever been ready have found 
themselves irresistibly impelled to make their 
work tell in the never-ending struggle between 
truth and error, between right and wrong, be- 
tween the conservative and the destructive 
agencies in the life of the social organism. 

How does our star-like Milton serve to illum- 
inate the doctrine of " art for art's sake " ? It 
is true that he turned from serene verse to 
stormy prose in his championship of the strug- 
gling Puritan Commonwealth, but it is also 
true that when he turned again to verse his 
thought took on a new majesty, and that the 
deepest feelings of puritanism are to be found 
rather in his epics than in his polemics. Surely, 
our literature has no nobler art than that of 
the " Paradise Lost," but was the poem written 



1900.]

for " art's sake " alone ? Not unless we take 
" art's sake " and " life's sake " to be synony- 
mous, which they probably are, if our defini- 
tions be made sufficiently liberal. In the final 
synthesis, beauty and truth and virtue are one 
and the same thing, and the " art's sake " shib- 
boleth appears but a question-begging phrase. 
We cannot judge the artist without in large 
measure judging the man as well, for as Pro- 
fessor Corson says, speaking of such poets as 
Milton, " their personalities and their works 
are consubstantial." But we may easily make 
the mistake and often do make it of bas- 
ing our estimate of a poet's character too much 
upon the trivial outward aspects of his life, and 
too little upon the writings in which his inmost 
self stands clearly revealed. If his actions and 
his books give each other the lie, why should 
we jump to the conclusion that the written ex- 
pression of character must be insincere ; why 
not take the more reasonable view that the true 
personality is to be sought in the books ? They, 
at least, if read aright, offer a form of self- 
expression that is deliberate and clear ; while 
a man's daily actions are impulsive and open 
to a hundred misinterpretations. 

Again writing of Milton, Professor Corson 
says : " His personality is felt in his every 
production, poetical and prose, and felt almost 
as much in the earliest as in the latest period 
of his authorship. And there is no epithet 
more applicable to his own personality than the 
epithet august. He is therefore one of the 
most educating of authors, in the highest sense 
of the word, that is, educating in the direction 
of sanctified character." What is here said of 
Milton we believe to be equally true of Shake- 
speare. We all know what Wordsworth said 
of the sonnet, that " with this key Shakespeare 
unlocked his heart," how Browning replied to 
this dictum with an indignant, " If so, the less 
Shakespeare he," and how Matthew Arnold, in 
a vein similar to that of Browning, wrote these 
lines : 

" Others abide our question. Thou art free. 
We ask and ask Thou smilest and art still, 
Out-topping knowledge." 

In this conflict of opinion, it seems to us that 
Wordsworth has expressed the deeper truth. 
It is true that the closest scrutiny of Shake- 
speare's work will not give us the facts about 
his boyish poaching upon Sir Thomas Lucy's 
preserves, or explain the mystery of that 
" second-best bed " bequeathed to his wife. But 
the knowledge of a man's personality does not 
depend upon such trivialities as these. We know 



his qualities of heart and mind better than we 
know those of our closest friends. We know 
what he thought upon most serious subjects r 
and how he felt about human life in its most 
significant aspects. The superstition which 
would have us believe that, as a dramatist, he 
exhibited the personalities of his created char- 
acters and concealed his own beyond any pos- 
sibility of surmise has been tenacious, but is at 
last losing its hold upon intelligent students. 
The little book of Mr. Frank Harris upon the 
man Shakespeare, and the still more recent 
book of Professor Goldwin Smith upon the 
same subject, are interesting records of the 
change of opinion upon this subject. Still more 
interesting is the closing paragraph of the 
important work of Shakespearian criticism 
which we owe to Dr. Brandes : 

" The William Shakespeare who was born at Stratf ord- 
on-Avon in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who lived and 
wrote in London in her reign and that of James, who 
ascended into heaven in his comedies and descended into 
hell in his tragedies, and died at the age of fifty-two in 
his native town, rises a wonderful personality in grand 
and distinct outlines, with all the vivid coloring of life 
from the pages of his books, before the eyes of all who 
read them with an open, receptive mind, with sanity of 
judgment, and simple susceptibility to the power of 
genius." 



THOREAU AS A HUMORIST. 

There are many volumes purporting to set out the 
choicest bits of American humor, but the compilers 
of practically all of them have omitted an important 
contributor to this branch of our literature. It is a 
question if there exists another set of books (of 
wisdom, at least) so potent for smiles, even hearty 
laughs, as are the works of Henry D. Thoreau. It 
is an oversight that his mirthful sayings have never 
been exploited by the excerptors. Even those who 
have essayed to interpret him in criticism have not 
adequately reckoned with this phase of his genius. 
Stevenson, for instance, in his rather querulous ap- 
praisement of Thoreau, but mentioned the gift ; and 
then, as it seems, only to the end of carping at the 
author for expunging some of its manifestations 
from his later works. The truth is, here is a rich 
vein of humor which belonged to Thoreau by right 
of inheritance ; his mother, and the Dunbar family 
of which she was a member, were remarkable, ac- 
cording to one of the biographers, for their keen 
dramatic humor and intellectual sprightliness. 
" Direct communication with the risible muscles of 
the globe " amounted to a family trait. 

Thoreau said of Carlyle that he lacked the repose 
in his inmost being necessary to make his humor 
thoroughly genial and placid. Repose in his inmost 
being one should say Thoreau did have in a pre- 
vailing degree. His humor, for the best part if not 



242 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



for the most part, is blue and transparent as the 
surface of Walden Fond itself. And when the 
smoothness of the mood is less it is as a rule, like 
the Pond and the poet's serenity, " rippled but not 
ruffled." 

Of course, Thoreau's is not always a perfectly 
good-humored humor ; it is often acrid. If he make 
you laugh, you not rarely find that you are laughing 
at somebody, or at mankind. One who offends his 
ideals he is capable of flaying rather mercilessly, 
with wit for a whip. The unlucky wight who 
named Flint's Fond for himself comes in for a 
scolding whose ill-temper is hardly atoned for by 
its eloquence. Usually, however, Thoreau wields 
his weapon lightly, relying upon the dexterity in 
preference to the force of his thrust. He is given 
to impaling his (intellectual) enemies, not with the 
bayonet, so to speak, but upon the point of his deli- 
cate naturalist's needle. In the midst of a matter- 
of-fact account of his bean-raising, he turns a laugh 
at the expense of the grosser public when a joke is 
least expected. His enemies in this gardening en- 
terprise, we are informed, were worms and wood- 
chucks ; " soon, however," he reflects dryly, " the 
remaining beans will be too tough for them, and go 
forward to meet new foes." At other times the fun 
is weak or quite abortive. He enjoys making a pun, 
and, punster like, especially a poor one ; but he is 
so guileless about it that one easily forgives him 
these trespasses. 

But there are many touches of sheer pleasantry 
with no one for butt. When he relates going to 
take possession of the hut he has purchased (for its 
boards) of the Irish workingman, he runs on whim- 
sically : 

"At six I passed him and his family on the road. One 
large bundle held their all, bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, 
hens, all but the cat ; she took to the woods and became a 
wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for 
woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last." 

Again, what fisherman but would confirm the phil- 
osopher's experience that he " found the increase of 
fair bait to be nearly as the squares of the dis- 
tances " ? Some of these quips and sallies are turned 
neatly and packed tersely enough to be likened for 
their keeping qualities to the staple article described 
in the following amusing bit : 

" Who has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this 
world, so that nothing can spoil it, and putting the persever- 
ance of the saints to blush ? with which you may sweep or 
pare the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster 
shelter himself and his lading against the sun, wind, and rain 
behind it, and the trader, as a Concord trader once did, 
hang it up by his door for a sign when he commences busi- 
ness, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether 
it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure 
as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and boiled, will 
come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday's dinner." 

The volume in which Thoreau's natural playful- 
ness finds freest vent is perhaps " Cape Cod " a 
book to be prescribed in cases of the blues, espe- 
cially to nature lovers. The science, philosophy, 
common-sense, poetical narrative here are seasoned 
continually with unmistakable humor. There is 



page upon page of delicious banter, directed now at 
the author of the old Cape history Thoreau reads 
under his umbrella, now at the quaint coast towns 
and the townspeople, now at the church and its 
ministers. His authority has lauded Sandwich town 
bravely, but Thoreau demurs : " Ours was but half 
a Sandwich at most, and that must have fallen on 
the buttered side some time." He reads of the 
prosperity of the worthy citizens of Chatham : " In 
many families there is no difference between the 
breakfast and supper ; cheese, cakes, and pies being 
as common at the one as at the other." To which, 
Thoreau : " But that leaves us still uncertain whether 
they were really common at either." He describes an 
unprepossessing Nauset woman as one who "looked 
as if it made her head ache to live." In 1662, 
Eastham, according to this history, decreed that a 
part of every whale cast on shore should be appro- 
priated for the support of the ministry. " The 
ministers must have sat upon the cliffs in every 
storm, and watched the shore with anxiety." East- 
ham also voted that every married man be required 
to kill so many crows or blackbirds, since these 
fowls were a pest in the grain fields. " But," ob- 
serves the facetious bachelor from Concord, " the 
blackbirds still molest the corn, . . . from which I 
concluded, that either many men were not married, 
or many blackbirds were." 

In " Walden," if the book be read with an eye to 
this element, one may enjoy a running feast of 
humor of a quality seldom matched in a book 
primarily serious. To an idealist who has once 
for all cast in his lot with his idealism, the spec- 
tacle of the work-a-day world is not only life with- 
out principle, it is life without sense. The farmer, 
in Thoreau's view, is 

''Endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a 
formula more complicated than the problem itself. To get 
his shoe-strings he speculates in herds of cattle. . . . And 
when the farmer has got his house he may not be the richer 
but the poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him. 
... I would say to my fellows, once for all, live free and 
uncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you 
are committed to a farm or the county jail." 

The man of business is eager for the newspaper, 
taking it up with the demand, 

" ' Pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man 
anywhere on this globe,' and he reads it over his coffee and 
rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on 
the Wachito River ; never dreaming the while that he lives 
in the dark unfathomed Mammoth Cave of this world, and 
has but the rudiment of an eye himself." 

Some of the sage's reflections under the topic 
" Economy, "charged with a mother-wit and homely 
wisdom that cannot be gainsaid, have become fa- 
miliar to everyone. 

" Kings and queens who wear a suit of clothes but once 
cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They 
are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes 
on. . . . For most men ... it would be easier to hobble to 
town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. . . . 
We know but few men, a great many coats and breeches. 
Dress a scarecrow in your last shift, you standing shiftless by, 
who would not soonest salute the scarecrow ? ' ' 
When Thoreau asked that a garment be made in 



1900.]

some particular way, the local tailoress disposed of 
his request by calmly saying, " They do not make 
them so now." Thoreau puzzled over this awhile, 
wondering who the mysterious " they " might be, 
and why their preference as to patterns should be 
binding on him ; and presently, thinking of no bet- 
ter rejoinder, replied : " It is true they did not 
make them so recently, but they do now." This 
quite nonplussed the good woman, and Thoreau got 
his clothes as he wanted them. 

As regards shelter, Thoreau's requirements may 
seem to smack of levity, though he protests he is 
far from jesting. 

" Furniture ! " he cries, " Thank God, I can sit and I can 
stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. . . . Formerly 
... I used to see a large box by the railroad, six feet long 
by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at 
night, and it suggested to me that every man who was hard 
pushed might get such a one for a dollar, and having bored a 
few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least, get into it 
when it rained, and at night, and hook down the lid, and so 
have freedom in his love, and in his soul be free." 

People used sometimes to ask the poet if he were 
not lonely at Walden. He answers : " I am no 
more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs 
so loud, or than Walden Pond itself. ... I am no 
more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in 
a pasture, or a bean leaf, or sorrel, or a house-fly, 
or a humble-bee." He knew the emptiness of the 
ordinary social existence and stated it with charac- 
teristic drollery : " We meet at meals three times 
a day and give each other a new taste of that old 
musty cheese that we are." 

At the same time, to visitors at Walden, and to 
visits paid thence by Thoreau, are owing some of 
the most delightful of classic passages. The Cana- 
dian Wood-chopper long since acquired fame as a 
piece of character- drawing. " He was so genuine 
and unsophisticated that no introduction would 
serve to introduce him, more than if you introduced 
a woodchuck to a neighbor." This was the original 
Thoreau appreciator from the point of view herein, 
who reclined on a log while the two conversed, and 
who " sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the 
ground with laughter at anything which made him 
think and tickled him." The casual visit to Baker 
Farm, where Thoreau retreated upon being over- 
taken by a thunder storm, affords this inimitable 
sketch : 

" [Here] dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and his wife 
and several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted 
his father at his work, and now came running by his side from 
the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sybil-like, cone- 
headed infant that sat upon its father's knee as in the palaces 
of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet 
and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privi- 
lege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble 
line and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John 
Field's poor starveling brat. . . . An honest, hard-working, 
but shiftless man plainly was John Field ; and his wife she 
too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the re- 
cesses of that lofty stove ; with round greasy face and bare 
breast, still thinking to improve her condition one day ; with 
the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it 
visible anywhere. The chickens, which had also taken shel- 
ter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members 



of the family, too humanized, methought, to roast well. They 
stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe signifi- 
cantly." 

Of this kind of comedy Thoreau was well-nigh 
master. One other example (from the chapter on 
" Sounds ") refuses to be left unquoted : 

" Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of 
wagons over bridges, a sound heard farther than almost any 
other at night, the baying of dogs, and sometimes again the 
lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn- yard. In 
the meanwhile all the shore rang with the trump of bull-frogs, 
the sturdy spirits of ancient wine- bibbers and wassailers, still 
unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake, if 
the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though 
there are almost no weeds, there are frogs there, who would 
fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables, 
though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave, 
mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become 
only liquor to distend their paunches, and sweet intoxication 
never comes to drown the memory of the past, but mere sat- 
uration and waterloggedness and distention. The most alder- 
manic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a 
napkin to his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs 
a deep draught of the once scorned water, and passes round a 
cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk, ir-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk ! 
and straightway comes over the water from some distant 
cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority 
and girth has gulped down to his mark ; and when this observ- 
ance has made the circuit of the shores, then ejaculates the 
master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, tr-r-r-oonk ! and each 
in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended, leak- 
iest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake ; and 
then the bowl goes round again and again, until the sun dis- 
perses the morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under 
the pond, but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time, and 
pausing for a reply." 

Let it be hoped that some day the appreciation 
will be general that this is a higher kind of humor 
than any machine output of our professional wits 
or comic papers. When the understanding does 
come, and along with the comfits people swallow 
the pills of wisdom, Thoreau's cure for the world's 
ills will begin to take effect.

FRANCIS DOUCE: A QUERY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Francis Douce was the author of " Illustrations of 
Shakspere," which was one time regarded as a text book 
of high authority. When the work first appeared, critics 
assailed the author with great fierceness, and he, being 
sensitive and irritable, determined never to publish any- 
thing more. A legacy was left him by Nollekens, the 
sculptor, which enabled him to live without resort to 
his pen, and he kept his word excepting for an occa- 
sional magazine article. He died in 1834. But he left 
some manuscripts in iron-bound boxes, and by his will 
directed that they be kept in the manuscript room of 
the British Museum, and remain unopened until Jan- 
uary 1, 1900. Has the literary world received any 
notice of the opening of the boxes ? If not, perhaps 
this note from " a man with a memory " may serve as a 
" pointer " to some enterprising publisher.

AN UNFINISHED RECORD OF THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN WAR.* 

" From Cape Town to Ladysmith " is the 
collective title of fifteen letters written by the 
late G. W. Steevens for a London newspaper, 
from the seat of the South African war. Mr. 
Steevens died, as the world learned to its sor- 
row, in January last of enteric fever at Lady- 
smith ; and in him the type or school of jour- 
nalism he wrought in lost perhaps its ablest 
and most representative exponent. Mr. Steev- 
ens arrived at Cape Town on October 10, and 
he gives his impressions of that somewhat lan- 
guid community in an interesting letter which 
forms the first chapter of the present volume. 
After spending a few days at Cape Town and 
en route to the seat of impending hostilities, 
he reached Ladysmith about October 20 ; and 
from there ten of the fifteen letters are written. 
In his letter, dated October 14, from Burghers- 
dorp, a stronghold of bitter Dutch partisanship, 
Mr. Steevens recounts his interview with the 
presiding genius of the place, a pastor who 
edited its Dutch paper, dictated its Dutch pol- 
itics, and poured out weekly vials of wrath upon 
the heads of politicians whose views were more 
moderate than his own. Personally, he turned 
out to be a genial old gentleman who kept his 
ill-humor for the printer, and who, while taking 
his own side strongly in conversation, was quite 
willing to allow that it was proper for a Briton 
to be equally strong on the other. The substance 
of his talk may be quoted, as illustrating a 
phase of Dutch Afrikander opinion. 

"... I look on this war as the sequel of 1881. I 
have told them all these years, it is not finish ; war must 
come. . . . The trouble is because the Boer have never 
had confidence in the British Government, just as you 
have never had confidence in us. The Boer have no 
feeling about Cape Colony, but they have about Natal; 
they were driven out of it, and they think it still their 
own country. Then you took the diamond-fields from 
the Free State. . . . Then came annexation of the 
Transvaal ; up to that I was strong advocate of federa- 
tion, but after that I was one of the founders of the 
Bond. After that the Afrikander trusted Rhodes 
not I, though; I always write I distrust Rhodes and 
so came the Jameson raid. Now how could we have 
confidence after all this in British Government ? I do 
not think Transvaal Government has been wise; I have 
many times told them so. They made great mistake 
when they let people come into the mines. I told them, 
This gold will be their ruin; to remain independent you

must remain poor. But when that was done, what 
could they do ? If they gave the franchise, then the 
Republic is governed by three four men from Johannes- 
burg, and they will govern it for their own pocket. The 
Transvaal Boer would rather be British colony than 
Johannesburg Republic. Well, well: it is the law of 
South Africa that the Boer drive the native north and 
the English drive the Boer north. But now the Boer 
can go north no more; two things stop him: the tsetse 
fly and the fever. So if he must perish, it is his duty, 
yes, I, minister, say it is his duty to perish fighting." 

Mr. Steevens gives a vivid account of the 
Elandslaagte fight " battle," he calls it in 
which testimony is borne to the humanity of 
the victors : 

" And mark and remember for the rest of your 
lives that Tommy Atkins made no distinction between 
the wounded enemy and his dearest friend. To the 
men who in the afternoon were lying down behind rocks 
with rifles pointed to kill him, who had shot, may be, 
the comrade of his heart, he gave the last drop of his 
water, the last drop of his melting strength, the last 
drop of comfort he could wring out of his seared, gal- 
lant soul. ... A few men had made a fire in the gnaw- 
ing damp and cold, and round it they sat, the unwounded 
Boer prisoners. For themselves they took the outer 
ring, and not a word did any man say that could mor- 
tify the wound of defeat. In the afternoon Tommy was 
a hero, in the evening he was a gentleman." 

When the Boers' turn came, at Nicholson's 
Nek, they, too, showed that when the duty of 
slaughter was done, and the fighting devil in 
them was laid, they could return to the ways 
of humanity, and do those acts which go to save 
the battlefield from being a scene of diabolism 
pure and simple : 

" As Atkins had tended their wounded there and 
succoured their prisoners, so they tended and succoured 
him here. . . . They gave the whole men the water out 
of their own bottles; they gave the wounded the blan- 
kets off their own saddles and slept themselves on the 
naked veldt. They were short of transport and they 
were mostly armed with Martinis; yet they gave cap- 
tured mules for the hospital panniers and captured 
Lee-Metfords for splints. Some of them asked soldiers 
for their embroidered waist-belts as mementoes of the 
day. ' It 's got my money in it,' replied Tommy a 
little surly, small wonder and the captor said no 
more. Then they set to singing doleful hymns of praise 
under trees. Apparently they were not specially elated." 

Everybody who has read of the siege of 
Ladysmith has read of " Long Tom," a lead- 
ing performer in that dreary drama, but not a 
very destructive or formidable one, if we may 
believe Mr. Steevens. 

"... 'He is a friendly old gun, and for my part I 
have none but the kindest feelings towards him. It 
was his duty to shell us, and he did ; but he did it in an 
open, manly way. Behind the half-county of light red 
earth they had piled up round him you could see his 
ugly phiz thrust up and look hungrily round. A jet of 
flame and a spreading toadstool of thick white smoke 
told us he had fired. On the flash, four-point-seven

banged his punctilious reply. You waited until you 
saw the black smoke jump behind the red mound, then 
Tom was due in a second or two. A red flash a jump 
of red-brown dust and smoke a rending-crash : he had 
arrived. Then sank slowly through the air his frag- 
ments, like wounded birds. You could hear them com- 
ing, and they came with dignified slowness: there was 
plenty of time to get out of the way. Until the capture 
of Long Tom when he will be treated with the utmost 
consideration I am not able to tell you exactly what 
brand of gun he may be. It is evident from his con- 
servative use of black powder, and the old-gentlemanly 
staidness of his movements, that he is an elderly gun. 
. . . Anyhow, he conducted his enforced task with all 
possible humanity." 

S tee vena's recital breaks off with pathetic 
abruptness. There is not much of it only 
156 well-leaded pages ; and these are supple- 
mented by a memorial chapter from the hand 
of the editor, Mr. Vernon Blackburn. The 
cable that flashed the news of Steevens's death 
to England states that a few days before the 
nd came he had so far recovered as to be able 
to do some journalistic work. Relapse fol- 
lowed, and he died at five in the afternoon. 
The cabled account of the funeral paints a 
mournful little picture quite in Steevens's own 
manner : 

" Funeral same night, leaving Carter's house at eleven 
thirty. Interred at Ladysmith cemetery at midnight. 
Night dismal, rain falling, while the moon attempted to 
pierce the black clouds. Boer searchlight from Um- 
balaa flashed over the funeral party, showing the way 
in the darkness." 

"Long Tom," we may fancy, boomed a requiem 
over the grave. 

Steevens was an exceptionally gifted painter 
of swiftly executed word-pictures in the impres- 
sionist style ; and descriptive journalism was 
therefore his true field. Afterthought, elabo- 
ration, retouching, must in some degree have 
taken the life and freshness out of his work. 
It has been regretted that he chose for his 
province journalism instead of literature Csome- 
body, of course, must always have his fling at 
journalism) ; but we think Stevens knew best 
what he was good for, and that he chose wisely. 
As journalist he served the world well, and 
blazed a new path for others ; and then how 
much literature there was in his journalism ! 
Proud spirits among us, condemned to a brief 
sojourn on a planet not specially swept and 
garnished for them, groan daily over the vices 
of the press, as if the press had nothing but 
vices. The press, like other human contriv- 
ances, might be a good deal better than it is ; 
and it certainly does not reflect the tastes and 
cravings of an ideal humanity. But it is fair 
to say that it makes on the whole powerfully 



for good in the world. It holds out, too, a 
generous reward to ability of the kind it needs. 
It turned the stream of Pactolus, or a saving 
rivulet therefrom, at least, into starving Grub 
Street. It gave Steevens his chance gave him 
early fame, and set him on the way to fortune. 
Steevens's style is well described as " cine- 
metographic." We think he tried to attain in 
his writing precisely the effect called to mind 
by that expression. His descriptions, the char- 
acteristic ones, affect us like a series of " cine- 
metographic " pictures running swiftly before 
the mind's eye. There are occasional lapses of 
taste, expressions too hurriedly minted ; and we 
tire at last of a series of such phrases as : " The 
trains drew up and vomited khaki into the 
meadow "; " the pipes shrieked of blood and 
the lust of glorious death "; " the bubble of 
distant musketry," and its " scrunching roar," 
(one is reminded of Mr. Stephen Crane's 
famous "crimson roar"). But there is no 
denying the extraordinary vividness of Mr. 
Steevens's writing, his power of making us see 
what he wanted us to see. His death must be 
accounted one of the more deplorable results of 
the iniquitous business now going on in South 
Africa, for his life was a really productive one, 
of much promise for the future. To his per- 
sonal attractiveness and worth Mr. Blackburn 
pays feeling tribute. This little book contains 
his last work ; and it will be prized the more 
for the excellent portrait that forms the fron- 
tispiece.

AN AMERICAN NATURALIST.* 

President Gilman has very fittingly outlined 
his recent life of Dana in the sub-title, " Scien- 
tific Explorer, Mineralogist, Geologist, Zoolo- 
gist, Professor in Yale University." That a man 
should achieve eminence in any one of these 
lines ordinarily would be counted enough, but 
the present biographer had the pleasant task 
of giving us an insight into the life of a man of 
marked achievements in all, the last of the 
famous group of men who in the closing years 
of the eighteenth and early years of the nine- 
teenth centuries have done so much for scien- 
tific work and thought and for whom there is 
no better title than the good old word, natur- 
alist. In a very peculiar way Professor Dana 
links the period of the naturalist and that of 
the specialist. While the broad studies of his

early years, his several books, and his more 
than two hundred scientific papers, demonstrate 
his claim to the title of naturalist, his precise 
and detailed work, particularly in the field of 
mineralogy, place him in the front rank of 
specialists even in these days of specialization. 
Dana will probably be remembered longest 
because of his researches in mineralogy and 
geology, and in these two branches his text 
books stand as his greatest works. His book 
on " Corals and Coral Islands " and on the 
" Characteristics of Volcanoes " are more de- 
tailed works, and in a sense are probably of 
greater permanent value. Text books, it is 
true, must necessarily change from time to 
time, while detailed observations and records 
of fact are of continuing worth. The essentials, 
however, of Professor Dana's work on corals 
and volcanoes are included in his text books, 
and the greater comprehensiveness of the latter 
make them the greater works. It is, indeed, 
in the fact that his Geology includes the result 
of so much original work that its greatest per- 
manent value lies. Text books must be to 
some extent compilations, but Dana's text books 
are based to an unusual degree upon personal 
observations and have contained in each new 
edition much original matter. He did original 
work of high and permanent value, and he chose 
to publish this in his texts. It was, however, 
as a teacher and interpreter that his greatest 
work was done. His power of accurate gen- 
eralization and his firm grip on the philosophy 
of his subject were the elements which gave 
him the mastery. He came into the geological 
field after the fundamental question of methods 
was settled. Ly ell's Principles had been pub- 
lished and accepted before he began his work. 
The Principles, however, while pointing the 
way to work, gave no suggestion of the evolu- 
tion of the earth as a whole, and it was Dana's 
peculiar privilege to work out this idea. His 
text book, in which the American continent is 
taken as the type, keeps steadily in view the 
development of the earth toward a definite re- 
sult. It is not a series of sketches of disjoined 
geologic periods. 

It is interesting to remember the readiness 
with which Professor Dana gave up his per- 
sonal methods or ideas whenever something 
better was offered. His system of crystallo- 
graphic symbols, for example, worked out with 
care and really of high utility, was eventually 
abandoned for that of Miller. His devotion 
was to the science, not to his personal methods 
or ideas. Throughout his long and busy life 



of eighty-two years, there seems to have been 
no time for thought of self. It was all for his 
work. 

Professor Dana was twenty years old when 
in 1833 he was graduated from Yale. His bent 
for scientific work was already pronounced, 
and his cruise through the Mediterranean in 
1833-34 served to deepen his inclination. He 
was fortunate in being chosen, and the world 
of science proved fortunate in that he was 
chosen, a member of the Wilke's exploring 
expedition, which in the years 1838 to 1842 
surveyed so much of the Pacific in the interest 
of knowledge. It is worth the climb to the 
upper alcoves of a library to find among the 
disregarded government publications the mag- 
nificent quartos in which Dana and his associ- 
ates tell the story of this enterprise ; one of which 
all Americans can well be proud. Equipped 
and maintained at government expense, the 
little fleet sailed over many miles of known and 
unknown seas, and in the work of exploration 
as well as in solid scientific results it amply re- 
paid the cost. No member contributed more 
to the lasting credit of the work than did Dana, 
and no member received more personal benefit 
than did he. The wide experience in many 
regions and with many sorts of phenomena, 
coupled with the necessity for close systematic 
work along the lines assigned to him, gave him 
the knowledge and the poise which made pos- 
sible his after work. 

The chapters in which President Gilman 
tells the story of this expedition are not the 
least interesting in the book ; and here, as else- 
where, he has wisely left the story to be told 
as much as might be in the words of Dana him- 
self. As a result, the letters telling of the dis- 
covery of Bowditch Island (p. 126), and the 
ways of the Feejees half a century ago (p. 131), 
have all the interest of contemporary writing. 
The pictures of life in Hawaii, Samoa, Aus- 
tralia, and on the west coast of the United 
States, are particularly interesting in these 
days when the Pacific holds so much of interest 
to Americans. 

Upon the return of the expedition Dana took 
up the work of studying and describing the 
specimens collected, and writing his three re- 
ports covering the geology of the region visited, 
the zoophytes and the crustaceans. This work 
occupied most of his time from 1842 to 1856, 
but the reports are of the greatest value. In 
view of his great contributions to the sciences 
of geology and mineralogy, the fact of his 
studies in zoology are quite generally over- 



1900.]

looked. It is well to remember that in his re- 
ports upon the zoophytes and crustaceans he 
not only had large and puzzling groups to deal 
with, but that he was almost entirely without 
the help of previous work. The classification 
which he worked out has been quite generally 
adopted, and the works were very substantial 
additions to the then sum total of zoological 
knowledge. 

One of the interesting features of his work 
in the Pacific was his study of corals and coral 
islands. He worked out independently sub- 
stantially the same theory of coral islands that 
is associated with Darwin's name, and which, 
with some modification, is the accepted theory 
of to-day. This work later gave rise to his book 
on Corals and Coral Islands. 

In 1856 he assumed the duties of " Silliman 
Professor of Natural History " at Yale, and up 
to the time of his death he held this position. 
In 1859, and again in 1868, his health broke 
down and he temporarily gave up college work. 
In 1880 he was released from college duties, 
though up to the date of his death (in April, 
1895) he continued to edit the "American 
Journal of Science," a work which he took up 
in 1848. This work, with his classes, the re- 
vision of his manuals, some field work and 
original investigations, took up the larger por- 
tion of his life. In the work he was brought 
into close contact with the leaders of scientific 
thought of both this country and Europe, and 
among the most interesting features of this 
biography are the pages given over to the let- 
ters which passed between Dana and Gray, 
Darwin, Agassiz, Guyot, Geikie, Brezelius, De 
Saussure, and others. These letters give one 
a side view of the development of many phases 
of scientific thought which can hardly be ob- 
tained from other sources. 

In 1887, when at the age of seventy-four 
years, Professor Dana crossed the United 
States, travelled to Hawaii and return, and 
made careful studies of the Hawaiian volcanoes. 
These studies are particularly valuable in view 
of his wide acquaintance with volcanic phe- 
nomena beginning with an ascent of Vesuvius 
in 1834 and including visits to Stromboli,Milo, 
Maderia, and Cape Verdes (1838), Tahiti, 
Tutuila, Upolu, and New South Wales in 1839 ; 
the Feejees and the Hawaiis in 1840 ; the 
craters of Oregon and extinct volcanoes of 
California in 1841 ; and a second visit to Vesu- 
vius in 1860. Professor Dana's acquaintance 
was equally wide with any subject upon which 
he undertook to write. 



In the arrangement of the biography, Presi- 
dent Gilman has followed the plan of present- 
ing original documents, with just enough of 
personal explanation to allow the latter to be 
read understand ingly. In his charming word- 
picture of New Haven in 1850 he has given a 
little sketch of wide and permanent usefulness. 

Professor Dana's was a rich, full life, a 
well rounded life of active work well done ; 
and it is pleasant to state that President Gil- 
man's book is a fitting recognition.

IN CENTRAL, ASIA.* 

The heart of Asia has assumed new import- 
ance within the past quarter-century. Russian 
aggression has reached the borders of Afghan- 
istan and British India, and is now simply 
biding an opportune time for further advances. 
These conquests have aroused diplomats and 
statesmen, best informed on the eastern ques- 
tion, to forecast the next possible move of the 
Muscovite power. Explorers, military men, 
and historians are likewise actively at work on 
some phase of this urgent question. 

"The Heart of Asia" is the joint product 
of a diplomat formerly in the employ of the 
English government in India, and of a special 
student of Persia. The first part of the book 
is a rapid survey of the history of central Asia 
from the earliest times down to the Russian 
occupation. The author, Professor Ross, has 
laid under contribution the best works extant 
on these countries, including many Persian, 
Arabic, and Russian authorities hitherto inac- 
cessible to persons unacquainted with those 
languages. He has also secured the coopera- 
tion of some of the best historical experts. 

The territory whose history is brought in- 
review is Turkestan, bounded on the north and 
east by the Sir Darya, on the south by Afghan- 
istan and the Hindu Kush, and on the west 
by the Caspian Sea. A portion of this terri- 
tory lying between the Oxus River and the 
Mountains of Paropanisus was called by the 
ancients Bactria. The first historical men- 
tion of this name is found in the Behistun 
inscription, dating from near the close of the

sixth century B. C., where it is included in 
the list of satrapies of the Persian Empire of 
Darius I. Cyrus penetrated these regions as 
far as the Jaxartes River. Alexander the 
Great also reached the same limits and occu- 
pied over three years in the subjugation of the 
hostile and independence-loving peoples of this 
region. The history of Bactria, or Central 
Asia, henceforth has been almost one perpetual 
battle for life. It has been occupied in turn by 
Iranians, Greeks, Scythians, Chinese, Turks, 
and Russians. One of the most genius-like and 
powerful conquerors and rulers mentioned in 
the long list is that of Chingiz Khan. Of him 
Stanley Lane-Poole, as quoted by our author, 
says (p. 160) : 

" The Mongol armies, divided into several immense 
brigades, swept over Khwarazm, Kborasan, and Af- 
ghanistan, on the one hand; and on the other, over 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Southern Russia; whilst a 
third division continued the reduction of China. In the 
midst of these diverging streams of conquest Chingiz 
Khan died in A. H. 624 (1227), at the age of sixty-four. 
The territory he and his sons had conquered stretched 
from the Yellow Sea to the Euxine, and included lands 
and tribes wrung from the rule of the Chinese, Tanguts, 
Afghans, Persians, and Turks." 

Thereafter the country was torn by civil war, 
a prey to the worst forms of tyranny, until de- 
livered by that man of destiny, and great fame, 
" Lame Timur," whose biography and history 
have formed a basis for all European historians, 
including even Gibbon. The thirty-eight years' 
rule of this cultured prince were the golden age 
of central Asia. Successive centuries found no 
relief from the barbarity and tyranny of the for- 
eign and native rulers of these regions until 
the intervention of Russia, and their final ab- 
sorption into the Muscovite empire at different 
dates since 1860. Russia's last signal battle 
for the possession of central Asia was fought 
in 1881. In the author's description of the 
awful carnage he estimates the importance of 
the battle in these terms (p. 297) : 

"Geok Teppe was the last stronghold of Central 
Asian independence, and its capture must rank among 
the decisive battles of the world. While civilization 
gained by the Russian victory, it is impossible to re- 
fuse sympathy to those who were crushed by its giant 
forces. With the conquest of Turkomania a national 
entity disappeared forever which had been preserved 
intact during ages of change and retained many noble 
qualities. The world is the poorer by the disappear- 
ance of such types, and by the gradual reduction of 
all mankind to a dead level devoid of color and charm." 

Of the benefits of Russian rule in these regions 
the author says : 

" Slavery is another practice which has lost its terrors 
since the advent of the Russians. Bokhara was once 



the greatest market in Asia for the produce of Turko- 
man and Kirghiz raids. Eighty years ago 40,000 Per- 
sians and more than 500 subjects of the Tsar were 
detained there in bondage. There was a regular tariff 
for these human cattle. A labourer fetched 29, a 
skilled artisan 64, and a pretty girl nearly 100. The 
treatment meted out to them by Bokharan taskmasters 
was more atrocious than anything recorded by Mrs. 
Beecher Stowe." 

The author's position is almost that of a 
Russophile. He sees the best side of Russian 
rule and diplomacy, and does not show a vig- 
orous hand in pointing out her radical defects. 
In support of his view he gives in the appen- 
dices translations of two notable documents ; 
the second was an address delivered at Askabad 
to a party of English tourists Nov. 25, 1897. 
In it we find this remarkable statement : "Our 
policy in Asia is essentially a peaceful one, and 
we are perfectly satisfied with OUP present 
boundaries." Events which have taken place 
on the Russian frontier since 1897, and are 
now in full progress in Persia and China, show 
that the position taken here regarding Russian 
policy and methods and results is especially 
roseate. 

The growth of Asiatic Russia is one of the 
marvels of modern civilization. "Russia in 
Asia " is a comprehensive, yet concise, history 
of this expansion of Muscovite sway. The au- 
thor has presented his conclusions as the result 
of investigation among the writings of more 
than two hundred authorities. In the descrip- 
tion of military campaigns, he has made use of 
the original Russian documents. Discussions of 
the diplomatic methods of Russia and England 
are based on official correspondence of the two 
countries. The book is furnished with exten- 
sive appendices, which reproduce in English 
dress all the important treaties and conventions 
now in force respecting the Asiatic frontiers of 
Russia. A round dozen maps vivify the whole 
discussion. 

The Russian Empire has extended, since the 
death of Ivan Basilovitz, in 1482, from 500,- 
000 to over 9,000,000 square miles, reaching 
from the eastern limits of Sweden and Ger- 
many to the Pacific and from the Arctic Ocean 
to Afghanistan and Persia. Asiatic Russia 
to-day comprises a total of 6,564,778 square 
miles. This territory extends over 40 degrees 
of latitude, and across 173 degrees of longi- 
tude, and includes " every species of climate, 
soil, and people." The rapidity with which 
Russia has absorbed this territory may be con- 
ceived when it is said that by actual computa- 
tion covering a period of 318 years, she has 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



249 



annexed an annual average of 20,643 square 
miles. At the present time Russia owns more 
than one-third of the total area of Asia, but 
only one forty-second of the population, while 
China owns less than one-fourth of the area, 
but more than one-half of the population. 

The history of the diplomatic methods em- 
ployed, and an array of the reputed reasons 
given, for the acquisition of a large part of 
this domain, are a series of revelations to those 
who are accustomed to the national transac- 
tions of Western powers. The author appears 
to give us a true picture of each conquest, of 
each diplomatic manosuvre, on the basis of ac- 
tual recorded statements. 

After Russia has in one way or another se- 
cured possession of all this territory, what does 
she do for its betterment ? The author, after 
studying the question from every side, comes 
to the following conclusion (p. 140) : 

" Russia in Asia is at present a purely military 
power. Her mission, as viewed by those responsible 
for her policy, is neither to develop territory nor to 
refine people. Her destiny is to use that which she 
already possesses as a means by which further con- 
quests are to be made, until by dint of an ever forward 
movement, she finds herself in possession, not of India, 
or of China, or Persia, but of the whole Asiatic con- 
tinent, which under the military sway of an army, ruled 
by the great White Tsar, may once again control the 
destinies of the world." 

In carrying out her designs (p. 143), 
"Russia is restricted neither by considerations of 
the law of war, nor by any code of self-imposed mor- 
ality. The ethics of Russian diplomacy are extremely 
simple. Diplomacy, being the means employed in the 
attainment of the ends most necessary to the future 
prospects of the State, is used without restriction of 
any kind. . . . Muscovite diplomacy is utterly unscrup- 
ulous, and pledges given or promises made are merely 
subterfuges, with the object of attaining something 
which is desired." 

The author cites many examples of the execu- 
tion of this policy within the last quarter cen- 
tury ; most striking of these are the cases of 
the capture of Merv while a Russian ambas- 
sador was sent to London to assure England 
that no such plan was in mind ; and the seiz-' 
ure of Port Arthur under guise of wintering a 
part of the Russian fleet in the shelter afforded 
by that harbor. The most efficient instrument 
in carrying out her designs is the army (p. 284) : 
" The life, the energy, and the intelligence of Russia 
are centred in her army, which, with certain exceptions, 
claims the service of every male within the age limit. 
. . . Each male spends eighteen years of his life in the 
standing army. ... A diminution in the period of ser- 
vice is gained by attaining a certain standard of educa- 
tion ; but as the opportunity of reaching this standard 
is not readily afforded, the proportion of the masses 



who benefit by the regulation is infinitesimal. The 
number of persons who can read throughout the Rus- 
sian empire is under three per cent of the population, 
and the existing school accommodation caters for under 
two million pupils out of a total population of 129,000,- 
000. And this state of things is likely to remain, for in 
the ignorance of its people lies the security of Russian 
bureaucracy." 

The author's exposition of Russian policy, 
methods, and conditions is based on more than 
fifty pages of official documents, and the 
best authorities found in Muscovite literature. 
While unsparing in his criticism of Russia, he 
has no patience at all with the slow and change- 
able methods adopted by England to counter- 
check her advances. His book is a timely note 
of warning, and should open the eyes of the 
Western powers to the comprehensive designs, 
the resourceful methods, and the results certain 
to follow in the wake, of the Muscovite power.

AN ENGLISH AND AN AMERICAN PLAY.* 

There is enough movement in the English 
drama for us to say that life is still in it. It is 
true that here in America affairs are in no very 
hopeful state ; true, also, that no great acting 
plays come to us from England. Still there 
are signs worth noting. One of these is the 
popularity of Mr. Stephen Phillips's play 
" Paola and Francesca ": the literary gossips 
inform us that the play is to be acted, that Mr. 
Mansfield has ordered another like it, and so 
on. To the fact furnished by this play we may 
add the recent publication of "Osbern and 
Ursyne," by John Oliver Hobbes, of which 
we have similar advertisement : Mrs. Patrick 
Campbell is said to be reading it, and other 
important things are happening. 

John Oliver Hobbes is not most widely 
known as a dramatist. It is now a year or so 
ago that we noticed " The Ambassador ": the 
play was given in New York not long since, 
and was currently pronounced witty but undra- 
matic. The present play was given semi- 
privately in New York, and was admitted to 
have technical excellence. But that particular 
point is not very important for the moment. 
When the play appears on the public stage it 
will be time to criticize it from the theatrical 
standpoint. 

Of chief importance now ("aside from the

intrinsic interest in the play, which will be dif- 
ferent for different people) is the fact that we 
have another example of the particular kind of 
romantic drama which now marks English lit- 
erature. In Germany there is now a romantic 
drama which goes far toward allegory : " Die 
Versunkene Glocke," " Die Drei Reiherfed- 
ern," "Die Konigskinder," these are em- 
phatically plays of ideas. In France there is 
something a little different : In " Cyrano de 
Bergerac " is a heroic romance which in spirit 
is still inspired by " Hernani." In England 
the drama is the romance of passion. Mr. 
Phillips's play, Mrs. Craigie's, Mr. John Dav- 
idson's " Godef rida," Michael Field's " Anna 
Ruina," these are of a type wholly different 
from the great French or German dramas. 
All medieval tragedies, for one thing, all ex- 
ploration of some tortuous by-way of passion, 
are marked by the atmosphere of the strange 
isolation of love. We take it that historically 
they belong to the school of Mr. Swinburne, 
who still lives in " Rosamunda." We think 
that the " Osbern and Ursyne " is most inter- 
esting in its significance. But there is good 
writing in it, too, and it would be worth read- 
ing even if there were no other dramas written 
in England. 

The publication of Mr. Clyde Fitch's " Na- 
than Hale " is also worthy of notice. We do 
not incline to believe that we have here any 
addition to literature. But we need not sup- 
pose, because a thing is put in such form that 
the world may read it, that it is necessarily to 
be thought of as literature. Mural and other 
inscriptions form a matter of considerable in- 
terest, and may be worth the attention of any- 
body. So, also, a close study of advertisements 
in all their varied forms, is an extremely curi- 
ous matter, and one which extends into vistas 
far beyond the imagination of the beginner. 
But neither inscriptions nor advertisements, 
valuable and fascinating as they are, can be 
called literature. 

Mr. Fitch's play is of course a theatre play, 
and its publication is not a matter of literature 
but a matter of record. It is a record of a very 
interesting fact, namely, that the play was suc- 
cessfully written and acted, and it is now pre- 
sented in a worthy manner. It is well printed 
and attractively bound, and illustrated with 
photographs of the original actors, both indi- 
vidually and in scenes. These pictures sug- 
gest a curious question, all photographs of 
stage scenes and groups do, namely, How 
can such stiff and awkward combinations ever 



have seemed natural ? That they do seem nat- 
ural enough on the stage, is a well-known 
fact. The pictures, however, are preeminently 
artificial ; not these especially, but all such. 

To some extent the same question is reechoed 
on reading the text of this or many another 
successful acting play, How can this ever go 
smoothly, naturally, and with any show of 
reality ? Perhaps the two questions together 
will suggest an answer : the stiffness of the 
stage setting and grouping is forgotten when 
we hear what the people say ; the convention- 
ality of what they say is relieved when we see 
them in their own persons and costumes. 
"Nathan Hale" is not a reading play, but 
many will like to have it for all that.

GARDENS AND THEIR PRAISES.* 

While lovers of verse may wonder at the 
exclusion from Mr. Sieveking's " Gardens An- 
cient and Modern " of nearly all poetry bearing 
upon his delightful topic, lovers of gardens for 
their own sake will find in the really erudite 
collection of prose which he has gathered 
through a wide reading nearly all that they 
could wish or hope for. Yet he is not without 
a reason for omitting the rhymes all garden 
lovers treasure, when he says " in a garden 
everyone is his own poet," and this is a better 
reason than his plea " that poetry is richer in 
flowers than in gardens." 

The work is an outgrowth of the former 
" The Praise of Gardens," now long out of 
print, but still prized by those fortunate enough 
to own it. It has now been enlarged, until 
its scope runs from the Nineteenth Dynasty of 
old Egypt to Mr. Alfred Austin, and from the 
Canticles to Mr. Charles Dudley Warner 
justifying the " ancient and modern " of the 
title to the foot of the letter. 

There are, too, an interesting Prologue, in 
which the various sources from which the read- 
ing matter and illustrations have been gleaned 
are set forth ; the pictures themselves, which

and an historical epilogue, wherein the story 
told brokenly in the selections is given original 
literary form, resulting in an essay of real 
value to the investigator. If old learning, 
quaint receipts, half remembered anecdotes of 
the great and wise in connection with gardens, 
and a charming style of his own can make a 
book delightful, Mr. Sieveking has won the 
palm. 

Miss Jekyll's " Home and Garden " is a 
most inclusive work, and the breadth of scope 
permitted by its name is taken advantage of 
almost to the full. The pleasantly printed vol- 
ume begins with the praise of the author's 
home, which is an English country house built 
with loving care and the almost perfect cooper- 
ation of the owner, architect, and builder. The 
owner is frank enough to admit that she would 
have been wiser if the architect had been fol- 
lowed a little more closely in his suggestion ; 
though there is a proverb concerning the intel- 
lectual qualifications of those who build which 
is more inclusive and comes to the same thing. 

From the interior of this charming house, 
built of timber and stone which the proud 
owner had seen years before in forest and quarry 
with honest and painstaking artisanship, it is 
an easy passage to the trees and flowers which 
make it beautiful without. Consequently, there 
ensue many chapters of delightfully empirical 
knowledge about the flora of that part of Brit- 
ain, told discursively and with a fine irrelevance. 
From cats to cauliflower and pot-pourri to phlox 
may distract the imagination, but it results in 
just the sort of book one loves to read, with no 
thought of finishing the work forthwith or any 
feeling of compulsion or necessity. 

Passing from the immediate realm of the 
garden itself, but returning to it from time to 
time as if loath to leave, " Outside the Garden " 
is the affectionate tribute of Helen Milman 
(Mrs. Caldwell Crofton) to the little land of 
Surrey where she has her home and shares her 
life with the living things, animal, vegetal, and 
human, of the neighborhood. It deals with 
hop-pickers, herons, cross-bills, literary men, 
men of science, mills, castles, abbeys, cottage 
gardens, felling trees, kings, queens, squirrels, 
sheep, nightingales, and Love, all embodied 
in little essays which abound with the spirit of 
out-of-doors and the sense of being told because 

O 

it was needful that the world should not forget 
the charm of nature. 

All these books, published with care and 
consideration, leave little to be desired in re- 
spect of paper, pictures, printing, and binding, 



and are an unwitting tribute to the ineffable 
tiresomeness and folly of an age which makes 
life in the dull sordid town needful to existence 
when we might all of us get into the woods and 
dales, winter or summer, for a better knowl- 
edge of ourselves and a better feeling for those 
about us. J OHN J> HOLDEN. 



THE INSENSIBLE, IRRESISTIBLE DRIFT 
OF FAITH.* 

The last half of the present century has shown 
a decisive change in the centre of gravity in men's 
religious opinions. The result is conspicuous in the 
insensible way in which conservative minds are 
drawn forward, and in the many checks by which 
radical ones are restrained. No man can write on 
religious themes at the close of the century as he 
would have written at its beginning. The attrac- 
tions and repulsions are all different. The centre 
of revolution is far out in the light compared with 
those earlier years. This fact impresses one strongly 
in looking through a miscellaneous collection of 
fresh publications from the religious press. No 
man escapes. 

The Gifford lectures, by Dr. Caird, are volumes 
of unusual interest. The biography which intro- 
duces them is well written, and the discussions 
which follow will especially please those who wish 
to accept the new faith with the least possible

[April 1, 



change of the old. Principal Caird possessed a 
vigorous and earnest mind, and yet one loath to de- 
part from beaten paths. The lectures on the fun- 
damental truths of Christianity are more radical 
than they seem to be. The fire has touched the 
flax, and the mind is free, though the ashes remain, 
with, here and there, a few fibres unconsumed. The 
living evolution of truth is a controlling idea with 
the author. 

" Christian Mysticism " is a rare book ; rare in 
scholarship and rare in penetration a book not 
to be expounded in a half dozen sentences. Mys- 
ticism, with the author, means that overplus of 
reason by which we force a passage through sensu- 
ous impressions, and take possession of the truly 
intelligible world, the spiritual world, beyond. This 
he has discussed in its characteristics and chief 
forms. It is a book which many will pass negli- 
gently, a few contemptuously, and a more consid- 
erable few will receive enthusiastically. We give 
a few passages which may enable the lover of books 
to determine its quality in reference to himself. 
"Reason is the logic of the whole personality." 
"Whatever view of reality deepens our sense of the 
tremendous issues of life in the world wherein we 
move, is for us nearer the truth than any view which 
diminishes that sense." " Personality is not only 
the strictest unity of which we have any experience ; 
it is the fact which creates the postulate of unity 
on which all philosophy is based." It is difficult 
for mysticism, even in its most sober expression, to 
escape the taint of ecstasy ; and this difficulty the 
author does not entirely overcome. 

" Thoughts of and for the Inner Life " is a vol- 
ume of twenty discourses, most of which were 
preached in the chapel of Yale University. We are 
somewhat disappointed in them. As a matter of 
course, they are good, but they are not as superior 
as published sermons should be. The thought is 
moderately discriminating, the style is somewhat 
abstract and cold, and the discussion rarely melts 
into vivifying feeling. The personal presence of 
the speaker may have reduced these defects, but 
they leave the printed sermon somewhat in the 
shadow. The subdued tone of sympathy which the 
presence and character of the preacher may have 
accentuated is not perceptible to the reader. 

" The Divine Pedigree of Man " is a clever book. 
It is clearly written, and gives some trenchant blows 
to Empirical Philosophy. The volume is a reductio 
ad absurdum of that phase of belief. Its own psy- 
chology, however, is of a mongrel order, and ex- 
plains little or nothing. According to the author, 
man is possessed of two minds ; one, perceptive and 
inductive, which is a function of the brain ; another, 
intuitive and deductive, which is independent of the 
brain. This latter is present in the very earliest 
manifestations of life, and so antedates not only 
brain structure but all organic structure. Thus the 
doctrine that intelligence is the function of brain 
tissue disappears, and mind makes its way backward 
to the mind of God. 



" The Victory of the Will " is a book of devotion, 
and good of its kind. It aims to awaken the spir- 
itual powers to deeper insight and a better mastery 
of invisible things. Most readers would find stim- 
ulus in it. The symbol of this class of books is, 
man overleaping the world rather than man bearing 
it on his shoulders. The two should be merged in one. 

" The Moral Order of the World " is a second 
course of Gifford Lectures. The first course The 
Providential Order of the World has already 
been noticed. The present volume is an historical 
and critical discussion of earlier and later beliefs 
concerning the moral government of God. The 
range of topics is broad. The discussion is per- 
fectly clear and candid, and the criticisms are well 
directed and sober. Almost everyone could profit 
by its perusal. 

"What Shall We Think of Christianity?" and 
" Can I believe in God the Father? " are composed 
of lectures ; the first series delivered before the 
Johns Hopkins University, and the second before 
the Harvard Summer School of Theology. Their 
drift is sufficiently indicated by the titles. They 
are popular rather than philosophical, and their 
value is reduced by the fact that the treatment is 
rambling and fails to yield a clear and compact line 
of thought. 

" Science and Faith " is a misnomer. The vol- 
ume has little to do with science as a form of knowl- 
edge, and next to nothing to do with faith. It is a 
rendering of the facts, real and imaginary, by which 
man has grown into a personal, rational life, and 
become a member of society. Judging from a final 
remark, we have suffered no special loss by this 
diversion from the proposed theme. " The two do- 
mains of science and faith are totally different 
are two contrary poles." 

" The Theology of Civilization " is a discursive, 
popular treatise. It discusses religious beliefs in 
connection with our current life and experience. 
The book shows clear thought and a large heart. 
By virtue of robust common sense, it delivers some 
very square blows. While it does not aim to be 
philosophical, it does not lack philosophy. 

One's first impression from the title of the book, 
" Enemies and Evidences of Christianity," is that of 
a disagreeable alliteration. Further acquaintance 
with the work, however, shows that the " enemies " 
were quite in the foreground of the author's con- 
ception, and not present by any rhetorical trick. 
Hinduism, Buddhism, Theosophy, Mrs. Eddy, Altru- 
ism, etc., are soundly belabored, the evidences being 
the convenient club with which it is done. The 
reason the author offers for this almost vicious 
attack, is the indignation which he calls righteous, 
experienced by him at the rhapsodies of meetings 
held in Maine that no-man's-land in the summer 
months. He evidently attached too much import- 
ance to these unrestrained outbursts of the religious 
sentiments, and assails them in excessive wrath. It 
was a case in which the precept was in order, " Be 
not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.'

" Religio Pictoris " is a noteworthy book, artistic 
in form, in purpose, and in treatment. The vitality 
and constructive elements in a picture are traced 
with delicate analysis, and are used as analogies 
interpreting to us that life picture which, in its mo- 
tive, its lights and shades, makes up for us our reli- 
gious faith. The work is executed with the same 
delicacy with which it is conceived. It leads us to 
the fundamental truth, that opposites, empirical and 
intuitional, in seeming contention, must be made to 
blend with each other in an ever more comprehen- 
sive and stimulating unity. We think, however, 
that the author has, in one or two instances, held 
too long to ideas, and striven to make them explan- 
atory beyond their power. The pump handle has 
been vigorously applied when the piston has simply 
wheezed and yielded no water. For the most part 
it pours forth a clear and refreshing stream. 

" Life Beyond Death " is a popular treatise, ap- 
parently shaped by service in the pulpit. The 
earlier portion is historical ; the later portion is an 
interesting discussion of Spiritualism, and of the 
results of the Society of Psychical Research. Dr. 
Savage believes that Spiritualism and these re- 
searches establish the existence of spirits of the 
dead. We are quite content to accept a grave obli- 
gation to those men who have striven to clear up a 
threshing-floor of so much chaff and dust in search 
for the few grains of wheat it contains. The spirit 
is a true one and a wise one. We are also ready 
to accept any confirmation thus brought to the doc- 
trine of immortality. We are not quite willing to 
regard it as a necessary or even important part of 
the proof. The doctrine rests on the force of our 
moral nature and of evolution. We believe it rests 
so securely as to be independent of these confused 
and doubtful phenomena. The mathematician does 
not feel the need of confirming his conclusions by 
empirical measurements. The appendix gives some 
very interesting personal experiences. 

Those who regard the older beliefs in theology 
as the germs, and the later beliefs as the flowers, of 
one plant ; who think that old things, in passing 
away, become new, will always be much interested 
in the works of President Hyde. He belongs with 
those who hold on to the past and the present with 
equal tenacity. The body of the volume, " God's 
Education of Man," is earnestly practical. The 
educational elements are three : law, grace, and 
service. They are traced in a vivid and cogent 
way. An introduction, and a briefer conclusion, 
raise the speculative inquiries by which the flow of 
religious faith is justified. 

The two volumes of Drummond's addresses, "The 
New Evangelism " and " Stones Rolled Away," are 
quite diverse. The first is made up of discourses 
carefully prepared for set occasions, and of special 
articles. Both the thought and the style adequately 
present the author. Henry Drummond was a very 
apt product of our time. He was possessed in equal 
parts of the devotion of faith, of the comprehensive 
thought which comes from enlarged knowledge, and 



of sound sympathetic common sense. " The New 
Evangelism " is an excellent illustration of the first 
two elements, and " The Problem of Foreign Mis- 
sions " of the third. The second volume is a repro- 
duction of the extempore addresses made in this 
country. They give the simple, homely, direct, and 
earnest method which belonged to him in an imme- 
diate effort to influence young men. They are a 
single outcome of a theory of life, rather than that 
theory itself. They disclose the practical side of 
his character. J OHN BASCOM. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

One of the latest numbers of the 
ySSZ*. " Beacon Biographies " (Small, May- 

nard & Co.) is a sketch of John 
Brown by Joseph Edgar Chamberlain. The book 
well merits attention, for the importance of the 
principles involved. The author tells us in his 
preface that his aim is to present a picture of 
the man, and to tell the story of his life, without 
inquiry into the effect of his work or estimate of 
his character. It strikes us that this omitted esti- 
mate is the very thing that readers of little books 
of this class most need. They are presumably busy 
people who, lacking time for larger books, want to 
find in a nutshell not only the story of a man's life 
but an estimate of his place in history as well. Mr. 
Chamberlain tells his story in the heroic vein, with- 
out qualification or extenuation. No book ought 
at this time to be written about Brown which does 
not clearly distinguish between his motive and his 
method. The singleness of his purpose and the 
pathos of his death will always make him a con- 
spicuous figure ; but it cannot be too strongly pointed 
out that his method was radically and terribly 
wrong, and that he hurt immeasurably the cause he 
hoped to help. That method may be tested by ap- 
plying it to present day issues. It is the method 
of the assassin who shot Goebel, or of a fanatic who 
would destroy a venal legislature in the manner of 
Guy Fawkes, involving innocent and guilty in com- 
mon ruin. The defense for Brown is that he had 
brooded over the evils of slavery until his narrow 
mind lost the distinction between right and wrong 
where slavery was concerned. It was the accident 
of the song that worked his apotheosis. Of the 
Cincinnati letter to Floyd, Mr. Chamberlain rather 
ambiguously remarks : " The identity of the man 
who sought to betray the secret is now pretty well 
known. It does not matter who it was." From 
this reference it appears that the author has missed 
the recent Statement, which conclusively connects 
this letter with David J. Gee, who wrote it not to be- 
tray Brown but to save him from himself. The front- 
ispiece portrait is from a photograph of a daguerreo- 
type " supposed to have been taken in Kansas in 
1856." Richard J. Hinton, who knew Brown well, 
tells us that the only picture Brown ever had taken 



254 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



in Kansas is the one in which he appears seated at 
a table and grasping a staff or pike, that Brown 
never looked as badly as this picture represents 
him, and be denounces it as a pro-slavery fraud. 
Be that as it may, it hardly matches the pen pic- 
ture of the book. One or the other needs correction. 



Thackeray'* Mr. M. H. Spielmann's researches 

anonym'iut ,, f , . , _ 

contributions among the archives of " Punch " 
to "Punch." have enabled him to positively iden- 

tify as Thackeray's a number of writings that ap- 
peared anonymously in the laborious and painstak- 
ing columns of that serio-comic journal between 
1843 and 1848. These writings, which range in 
length from an epigrammatic paragraph of a line 
or so to an article of a page or more, and from a 
couplet to a poem of one hundred and twenty three 
lines, Mr. Spielmann now publishes in a comely 
volume under the perhaps unavoidably cumbrous 
title, " The Hitherto Unidentified Contributions of 
W. M. Thackeray to ' Punch ' " (Harpers.) We 
may say at once that the book is unquestionably one 
which the lover of Thackeray and the collector of 
his works must have for the sake of its biblio- 
graphic and biographic interest. The literary qual- 
ity of the papers, it is hardly necessary to say, is 
slight, and their humor has largely evaporated with 
the passing away of the interest of the more or less 
ephemeral political and other questions that inspired 
them. As an index to the writer's opinions on the 
questions and events of his day, they are of some 
value ; but we can hardly agree with Mr. Spiel- 
mann that Thackeray, writing under the veil of 
anonymity, was likely to be more frank or bluntly 
outspoken than when he wrote over one of his fa- 
miliar pen-names, or over his own signature. We 
find no indications of this additional frankness in 
the present volume, and this, for obvious reasons, 
we do not think altogether regrettable. There can 
be no question as to the authenticity of the pieces 
collected by Mr. Spielmann, since they are all en- 
tered as items against Thackeray's name in a long- 
forgotten editorial day-book, and duly checked off 
as paid for. The drawings which accompanied 
them, where they are unquestionably from Thack- 
eray's hand, are reproduced, and add much to the 
humor and attractiveness of the book. Mr. Spiel- 
mann has judiciously supplemented the text with 
such comment and explanation of his own as seemed 
necessary to its full elucidation. A full and con- 
veniently arranged bibliography of Thackeray's 
contributions to " Punch " is appended. 



The "Temple" 
Shakespeare in 
a new form. 



He is hard to please who cannot find 
an edition of Shakespeare to his lik- 
ing. It would seem as if all the 
possible ideas and combinations of ideas in the 
mechanical presentation of the plays must have been 
exhausted long ago, and yet such are the fluctua- 
tions of taste and the caprices of bookish fash- 
ion that every year brings forth some new edition 
that seems to strike a responsive chord not struck 



before. The year just past, for example, has given 
us two editions that are in some respects more de- 
sirable for general reading than any that have pre- 
ceded them. One of these, the " Eversley " edition, 
superintended by Professor C. H. Herford, has 
already received our praise, and for convenient 
handling and chaste simplicity would be difficult to 
surpass. Its ten volumes are a delight to the hand, 
the eye, and the scholarly sense. But if a more ornate 
edition be asked for, the new and larger " Temple " 
Shakespeare (Macmillan) seems to embody the 
ne plus ultra of charm and general attractiveness. 
This edition, under the care of Mr. Israel Gollancz, 
is to fill twelve volumes, of which eight are now 
before us. The mechanical features of this edition 
are a typography similar to that of the earlier 
" Temple " volumes, a combination of daintiness and 
elegance in many matters of detail, and a series of 
illustrations that greatly enhance its value. There 
are full-page frontispieces to each play, and a great 
variety of cuts scattered among the notes. The 
method of illustration is strictly realistic, and has 
been made possible by access to the rich collection 
of materials left by J. 0. Halliwell-Phillipps. The 
order of the First Folio has been followed ; " Peri- 
cles " will appear in the eleventh volume ; and the 
twelfth will include, besides the Poems and Son- 
nets, an illustrated account of Shakespeare's life. 
Purchasers who acquire this charming edition will 
never have reason to regret their expenditure. 

The celebration of the Pope's nine- 

Life and work .. ,. . .. j . ,, , . 

of Pope Leo xill. tletn birthday gives an added interest 
to the admirable biography, " Pope 
Leo XIIL, his Life and Work " (Lippincott), by 
Julien de Narfon, recently translated by G. A. 
Raper. The pious and learned man who now oc- 
cupies the papal throne has had a distinguished 
career, showing himself equal to every situation to 
which he has been called. Throughout almost the 
entire administration of his predecessor Pius IX., 
he was Bishop of Perugia ; in 1853, he was made 
cardinal; in 1877 camerlengo, or chamberlain, of 
the papal household ; in 1878, two weeks after the 
death of Pius IX., he was chosen pope. In all of 
these offices, he exhibited a rare combination of 
learning and administrative ability. He is an ele- 
gant Latin scholar, a poet of no small merit, a 
founder and patron of schools and colleges ; and he 
has proved himself in addition an excellent man of 
affairs. In his character of supreme chief of the 
Roman Church, he has put himself in relation with 
the principal governments of the world, and in ne- 
gotiations with Belgium, Spain, Germany, Russia, 
and other lands, has displayed admirable intelli- 
gence, patience, and tact. Throughout his entire 
pontificate, Church and State have been engaged 
in a quarrel mutually hurtful to Italy and the 
papacy. This so-called Roman question that is 
to say, the respective positions of the Vatican and 
the Quirinal, and their relations to one another is 
far from being a mere Italian affair. It demands the

attention of every foreign government that has any 
large Roman Catholic population subject to its rule. 
It has now reached a climax and a great crisis is 
imminent, not only in the fortunes of Italy, hut in 
the history of the mother church. This book does 
much towards enlightening the reader concerning 
the complicated situation ; but its great value is in 
introducing us to an intimate knowledge of perhaps 
the most interesting personality among living men. 
The large number of beautiful illustrations of not- 
able places and persons adds greatly to the charm 
of the volume.

gland, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Wales, 
and several other kingdoms, principalities, and col- 
onies on the other, should be published in the United 
States within the last two months, may be taken to 
mean that recent British success is not regarded 
with any particular enthusiasm by American lovers 
of liberty and free institutions. That both of them 
should side energetically with the small against the 
great is to be expected from those who understand 
the ease with which the English-speaking peoples 
discern motes in the eyes of others, however regard- 
less of beams within their own. " Who Ought to 
Win ? " (Laird & Lee), by Mr. Spencer Randolph, 
is an energetic plea for the burghers, based on his- 
tory in the past as well as policy in the future. It is 
not always carefully considered, and many extracts 
are used which might have been omitted to advant- 
age, but it stands for the average American feeling 
in the matter with considerable accuracy. " The 
Transvaal Outlook " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), by Mr. 
Albert Stickney, is a military criticism from the 
point of view of an expert learned in the lessons of 
our own civil war, with strong leanings to the Re- 
publicans so far as history and justice is concerned, 
but rather designed with a view to pointing out the 
real strength of their position strategically consid- 
ered. The work deals more particularly with the 
questions of transport and the length of the British 
lines, taken in connection with the proved mobility 
of the burghers' forces, and the possibility of re- 
peating some of the deeds of Forrest, Wheeler, 
Sheridan, or Sherman. 

Early history The lectures contained in Dr. Karl 
o/ the religion F. R. Budde's latest volume, "The 
Religion of Israel to the Exile'; (Put- 
nam), form the fourth series of " American Lec- 
tures on the History of Religions," and were deliv- 
ered in the fall of 1898 by the well-known professor 
of Old Testament exegesis in Strassburg. A careful 
reading of the book confirms the impression received 
from hearing the lectures, that in them we have an 
invaluable exposition of the origin and early history 
of the Yahweh religion, which will do much to pop- 
ularize the important results of modern Biblical 
criticism. Dr. Budde's point of view is that of a 
conservative ; he belongs to the school which rep- 



resents the reaction against the indiscriminate re- 
jection of tradition as void of all historical value. 
While he recognizes the difference between tra- 
dition and history, he points out that "tradition 
in numberless cases clothes genuine history in 
forms which, at first sight, appear to deserve no 
confidence at all. The task of the true historian 
is, first of all, to understand the tradition. When 
it is correctly understood he will not throw it away, 
but will make use of it in the proper sense and in 
the proper place." From this point of view the 
Biblical tradition concerning the history of Israel 
as a nation appears to Professor Budde to be, in its 
main features, trustworthy. He has endeavored to 
present the results of Old Testament scholarship 
not from the negative side, " but as a thoroughly 
positive work of preserving, restoring, building up." 
He has succeeded in giving us a clear, consecutive, 
and eminently satisfactory view of the subject. One 
regrets that the Index is not fuller. 

Naval battle* No better subject ever lay ready for 
from Saiamis the historian's hand than that taken 

to Santiago. up by Mr Ednrar( J Kirk R awson j n 

his " Twenty Famous Naval Battles : Saiamis to 
Santiago" (Crowell). Himself a professor in the 
United States Navy and superintendent of the 
Naval War Records, Mr. Rawson had the admir- 
able example of Creasy's " Fifteen Decisive Battles 
of the World " on which to model his own work. 
Moreover, his two octavo volumes, from introduc- 
tion to ending, show a profound knowledge of the 
problems involved and great naval erudition such 
as must serve to give it permanent value as a book 
of reference. The battles selected are hardly to be 
quarreled with, though Yalu or Wei-hai-Wei might 
have been mentioned. The inclusion of the Bon 
Homme Richard - Serapis, Constitution - Guerriere, 
Monitor-Merrimac, and Kearsage- Alabama duels, 
in addition to detailed accounts of the battles of 
Lake Erie, Mobile Bay, Manila, and Santiago, give 
the book perhaps a too pronounced American flavor. 
And no Englishman could be expended to lend his 
approval to omission of the battle of the Baltic or 
St. Vincent from the list. But what injures the 
book more than anything else is the author's ab- 
sence of imagination, leaving his histories, for all 
the vividness of action inherent in them, almost 
wholly without the quality of picturesqueness. 
What should have been a work to be read and re-read, 
becomes, in consequence, one rather to be relegated 
to the book-shelves for consultation as an authority 
upon occasions of formal historical reference.

are fascinating in the telling ; everything respect- 
ing the book, therefore, makes it of unusual interest. 
Mr. Laughton, whose services for the naval histories 
and biographies in the " Dictionary of National 
Biography " are still remembered, has been the ed- 
itor here, giving a series of twelve " lives " of as 
many sea-fighters a unity of treatment and design 
impossible without such assistance. The biogra- 
phies themselves are from various hands, among 
whom are Admiral Sir Edmund R. Freemantle, 
Admiral Sir R. Vesey Hamilton, Vice-Admiral 
Sir Frederick G. D. Bedford, Vice-Admiral Philip 
H. Colomb, and Captain Montagu Burrows, all the 
contributors being high in the Royal Navy with the 
exception of the editor himself, who writes of How- 
ard "my Lord Howard" of Tennyson's "Re- 
venge." Nothing in the way of original treatment 
is attempted, and the absence of technicalities is 
marked. There is always to be noted the perfect 
comprehension and eager sympathy which adds so 
much to the value of such collections as this, while 
the reputation of nineteenth century sailors for writ- 
ing terse and vigorous English is fully sustained 
throughout. As a history or romance or both com- 
bined, the book is worth reading, even by those who 
know their Southey by heart.

air of disdainful superiority concerning theirs, by 
the recent publication, under the editorship of Mr. 
Alfred Wallis, of " The Poetical Works " of the 
Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker, M.A. (John Lane). 
Hawker is chiefly known to this generation as the 
writer of the " Song of the Western Men," contain- 
ing the famous stanza, 

" And have they fix'd the where and when ?

which was taken by Macaulay as contemporaneous 
with the imprisonment of Sir John Trelawney in 
1688, and subsequently became the subject of an 
animated discussion. Contrary to the usual impres- 
sion that Hawker availed himself of an old refrain, 
the editor here contends sturdily for the complete 
originality of the poem, chorus and all. Though 
none of the poet's verses were included in u The 
Golden Treasury " of Palgrave, he had a wide pop- 
ularity in his day and his poems are of great inter- 
est. During his lifetime, 1803-1875, he published 
thirteen volumes of verse, many of which passed 
through more than one edition. 

It is certainly not for lack of instruc- 
tion, definite and indefinite, that any 
woman fails to recognize the niche 
she was intended to fill. But instructions cannot 
undo the facts contained in lack of a training so

work of hands or head. The growing thought 
among progressive educators makes manual train- 
ing, on both the art and the mechanical side, the 
foundation of all education. In such training the 
natural bent of the child becomes plainly discern- 
ible, and this forever ends that familiar condition 
known as the " square peg in a round hole." Mrs. 
Helen Candee Churchill is known as a graceful, and, 
on the whole, sensible, writer for women, and her 
little volume " How Women May Earn a Living," 
lately issued by the Macmillan Company, is fairly 
practical, and certainly pleasant reading. Perhaps 
nothing better could be said to the untrained and 
rather helpless woman thrown suddenly on her own 
resources. But the need of such a book in itself 
emphasizes that other need the demands for an 
education that shall develop to its utmost capacity 
every power latent in the child. When this need 
is recognized, the day of handbooks for the helpless 
or half competent will end, and the library shelf, 
that now holds a series of this order, be cleared for 
something more in accord with life as it should be, 
and, as it is dawning upon us, we have power to 

make it. 

A manual ^ brief manual for the use of those 

of the British who may desire to acquire an ele- 
House of Commons. mentary idea of the British House 
of Commons of the present time has been prepared 
by Sir Richard Temple, whose knowledge of his 
theme has been derived from his experience as a 
Member during the eventful decade, 1885 to 1895 
(A. Wessels Co.). The author has not attempted 
to recount the parliamentary history of that period, 
nor to discuss the merits of its great issue, the Irish 
Question. His object has been to indicate broadly 
the ways and character of the House as at that time 
constituted, as they might have appeared to an im- 
partial observer. The text is divided into nine 
chapters, each dealing concisely and clearly with a 
special phase of the subject. The first is introduc- 
tory, and describes the personnel of the House of 
1885, and of each of the subsequent elections dur- 
ing the decade treated. Thence, the author pro- 
ceeds to discuss The House of Commons as a Club, 
The Precincts and Buildings, Life in Parliament, 
Manners and Customs, Scenes in the House, Lead- 
ing Figures, The Irish Nationalist Party, The Lords 
as Seen by the Commons. American readers will 
find in Sir Richard Temple's little handbook just 
the modicum of general information as to the mod- 
ern House of Commons that everyone ought to have, 
and it is pleasantly imparted. 

We Americans have an historical 
interest in Nova Scotia surpassing 
that of most of the other British 
provinces at the north of us. The Thirteen Colo- 
nies sent into the province in 1760-61 a large emi- 
gration called the pre-loyalists, and a much larger 
one of loyalists, at the close of the Revolutionary 
War. More than any other elements of the popu- 
lation, perhaps, these two emigrations gave charac-

ter to Nova Scotia. At one time it might almost 
be called a New England colony ; thus, in January, 
1767, the Americans were 6.913 of the total pop- 
ulation, which counted 13,394. Sir John G. Bour- 
inot, the veteran Canadian historian, gives in his 
" Builders of Nova Scotia " (Toronto : The Copp- 
Clark Co.) a compendious but luminous and inter- 
esting view of his subject. To the builders proper, 
who are treated under the heads, u Origin of the 
People of Nova Scotia," and " Establishment of 
the Great Churches," Parts I. and II., there is 
added a third part, which must give especial interest 
and value to the book in the case of the Nova 
Scotians. This division of the volume is entitled 
" Reminiscences of Eminent Nova Scotians for over 
Forty Years." One-half of the volume, which em- 
braces about two hundred pages, is filled with val- 
uable historical documents. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Soul of Man," by Dr. Paul Carus, is essen- 
tially a treatise upon the anatomy and physiology of 
the brain, although it is supplemented by certain chap- 
ters of a more strictly psychological character. The 
work had a well-deserved success when first published, 
several years ago, and a second edition now appears, 
this time in paper, as the January number of " The 
Religion of Science Library." It comes to us from the 
Open Court Publishing Co. 

" Le Morte Darthur " of Sir Thomas Malory forms 
two volumes in the handsome " Library of English 
Classics " recently begun by the Macmillan Co. Mr. 
A. W. Pollard is the editor, and supplies a bibliograph- 
ical note from which we learn that he has followed the 
Caxton text as reprinted by Sommer. The editor 
speaks of various conjectures concerning the personal- 
ity of Malory, but does not seem to have been acquainted 
with the evidence adduced by Dr. G. L. Kittredge, 
which goes far toward settling this long-disputed ques- 
tion. 

Huxley's " Lessons in Elementary Physiology," pub- 
lished in various editions, from 1866 to 1885, under 
the author's supervision, has recently undergone an ex- 
tensive revision at the hands of Drs. Michael Foster and 
Sheridan Lea. This revision is the basis of the volume 
now published by Dr. Frederic S. Lee (Macmillan), 
who has, however, made such alterations as were needed 
to fit the work for the use of American students. 

Two contributions to the rapidly growing library of 
Omar literature have been upon our table for some 
weeks. One is the " Ruba'yat of Omar Khayam " 
(Lane), translated by Mrs. H. M. Cadell, and prefaced 
by a memoir of the translator, written by Dr. Garnett. 
Mrs. Cadell (1844-1884) was a student of Persian, and 
her hundred and fifty quatrains are close reproductions 
of the original, although as poetry no one would think 
of comparing them with the paraphrase of FitzGerald. 
" One Hundred Quatrains from the Rubaiyat of Omar 
Khayyam," published by the Brothers of the Book, is a 
translation by Miss Elizabeth Alden Curtis, and is intro- 
duced by Dr. Richard Burton. We are not informed 
as to whether the translator has worked from the orig- 
inal or from other translations. 



NOTES. 



The authorized edition of Mr. Kipling's ballad of 
" The Absent-Minded Beggar " is published by Messrs. 
Brentano's in a handsomely-printed booklet. 

" King John " is the latest volume of the charming 
" Chiswick " Shakespeare with illustrations by Mr. Byam 
Shaw, of which the Macmillan Co. are the American 
publishers. 

The American copyright of M. Rostand's new play, 
" L'Aiglon," has been secured by Mr. R. H. Russell, 
who will issue the work simultaneously with its publi- 
cation in England and Paris. 

A sensible little essay on " How to Tell a Good Pic- 
ture," written by Mr. Charles H. Caffin, art critic of 
" Harper's Weekly," is published in pamphlet form by 
Messrs. Curtis & Cameron, of Boston. 

A second edition of Mr. Edmund G. Gardner's 
" Dante's Ten Heavens " has just been imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The work has been 
revised in numerous minute particulars. 

The military articles by Mr. Spencer Wilkinson, 
which have attracted much attention in the columns of 
the London " Post," will be issued shortly in book form 
by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., under the title "War 
and Policy." 

M. Henri de Re*gnier will give four lectures in Chi- 
cago, April 9-12, under the auspices of the University 
of Chicago. They will be given alternately at the Art 
Institute and the University, at 4:30 P.M., and will be 
free to the public. Contemporary French poetry will 
be the general theme of the lectures, two of them being 
special studies of Verlaine and Mallarmd. 

Two editions of "The Professor," by Charlotte 
Bronte, come to us simultaneously. One is the " Ha- 
worth " edition (Harper), with the customary introduc- 
tion by Mrs. Humphry Ward, and the attractive illus- 
trations. This volume contains also the poems of the 
Bronte sisters, as well as the " Cottage Poeins " of their 
father. The other is the " Thornton " edition (imported 
by Scribner), containing the titular novel alone, and is 
without illustrations, save for the frontispiece. 

The death, March 21, of Henry Cohn, Assistant Pro- 
fessor of German in Northwestern University, has re- 
moved one of the most active mediators between German 
and Anglo-American life, as well as a teacher of re- 
markable gifts and enthusiasm. He was born in Berlin 
on February 2, 1847, came to America as a child, and 
was educated at Columbia College in New York. After 
graduation he taught German in the School of Mines 
of the same institution. From 1871 to 1873 he attended 
the University of Berlin, studying Germanics, orientalia, 
history, and philosophy. In 1875 he founded a private 
school of languages in New York ; then conducted 
summer-schools in various parts of the country; and 
after maintaining a school of languages in Chicago, 
became connected with Northwestern University in 
1893. In addition to the regular duties of his profes- 
sion, which were performed with remarkable vigor, he 
founded societies for encouraging general interest in 
the German language; and from time to time he secured 
the presence of distinguished German talent in Evans- 
ton. For a number of years he had charge of the sum- 
mer school of German at Cbautauqua. 

On March 22 the old and honored house of D. Appleton 
& Co. passed into the hands of a receiver, the result of 
the inability of the firm to secure extensions on notes

falling due on that date. The failure was indirectly 
precipitated by the recent misfortunes of the Harper 
house, and was not in any way due to financial losses or 
bad judgment in business risks. The lenders of money 
holding paper issued by the Appletons, frightened by 
the recent revelations at the Harper establishment, were 
unwilling to grant favors to the publishing house, and 
the firm promptly laid the situation before its heaviest 
creditors and decided on the application for a receiver 
as the best protection for all concerned. The liabilities 
amount to something over a million dollars, but the 
assets are large, and of such a character that it is be- 
lieved all claims will be paid in full. The receiver is 
Mr. J. Hampden Dougherty, a lawyer of high standing 
who has had intimate knowledge of the firm's affairs for 
some years, and he will continue the business until plans 
for a re-organization can be formulated. The present 
reverses of the house will cause universal regret and 
sympathy, and it is to be hoped that a re-organization 
may soon be accomplished that will put the firm in posi- 
tion for continuing on a more effective basis than before.

SCRIBNER'S NEW BOOKS 



A New Novel of American Life by ROBERT GRANT 

UNLEAVENED BREAD 

In UNLEAVENED BREAD, a phrase in which the character of the heroine is epitomized, Mr. Grant has 
advanced a long step in his literary career. The novel, which is to have its first issue in book form, deals 
boldly and vigorously with the social conditions peculiar to modern life, the career of the heroine being followed 
as she attains to one after another of her ambitions. The three large divisions of the novel indicate the stages 
of this career "The Emancipation," "The Struggle," and "The Success," although, as the reader of the 
novel will note, the " success " which the heroine achieves is to be taken satirically as reflecting the point of 
view of the clever and ambitious woman of the world who has reached her goal. 12mo, $1.50.

Cloth, $1.25. 

" The false opposition which many conceive to exist 
between religion and ethics should lead no one to infer 
from the title of his book that his ethical Sunday-school 
is not also religious. It rather intimates the emphasis 
laid on ethical teaching and character-building an 
emphasis not duly regarded in many a Sunday-school. 
Consequently, Mr. Sheldon's book deserves to be reck- 
oned as a substantial contribution toward the improvement 
of Sunday-school methods. . . . We highly value his book 
as both stimulating and helpful in a line of teaching in 
which Sunday-schools are often deficient." Outlook.

JAMES LANE ALLEN'S WORKS 



A NEW NOVEL TO BE PUBLISHED IN APRIL. 

i THE REIGN OF LAW: 

A Tale of the Kentucky Hemp= Fields. 

Cloth, 12mo, $1.50. 

Like the best of Mr. ALLEN'S writings, this is a story of Kentucky life, but in no degree a 
repetition of anything in his previous books. Indeed, the scenes which form the background 
of the story's movement have never before been pictured in American fiction. The period is 

that at the close of the Civil War, 
about 1865. All of the characters, 
but in an especial degree the young 
man and woman in whom the in- 
terest of the story centres, have 
felt the upheaval of standards, the 
social and intellectual changes, brought about by the war, and are adjusting themselves to the 
new conditions and relations forced on them by the war. Each is the child of a revolution ; 
she has been forced by circumstances from a high social position to obscure hard work, which 
she would not have been free to follow before the war ; his form of the new liberty is intellectual, 
where hers is social, but the two streams of revolution run together and act on each other. 

New Editions forming a complete set of Mr. ALLEN'S characteristically American novels. 

THE CHOIR INVISIBLE. 

Cloth, $1.50. 

" There are two chief reasons why Mr. Allen seems to me 
one of the first of our novelists to-day. He is most exquisitely 
alive to the fine spirit of comedy. He has a prose style of won- 
derful beauty, conscientiousness, and simplicity." 

BLISS CARMAN in The Evening Transcript (Boston). 



Mr. Allen's description 
of the HEMP-FIELDS is a 
fresh picture in American 
fiction, one never before 
used by any writer. 



In Mr. Allen's work we 
have the unusual blending of 
realism and poetry ... it 
has an almost unique place in 
American fiction."

osity of the lords of the paradise of fine horses, are in

A KENTUCKY CARDINAL. 

" There is most delicate humor in every page of 'A Kentucky 
Cardinal, 1 a humor so quaint and so tender that it melts con- 
tinually into pathos, whilst through it all runs a strong vein of 
romance. And Mr. Allen's style is as delightful as his matter 
is pleasant. Limpid, crisp, and pungent, the stream of the 
narrative flows easily along, sometimes sparkling with droll 
humor, again deepening into fervent human feeling, as the 
story sways between gaiety and gravity." Speaker (London). 



AFTERMATH : 



A Sequel to 
A Kentucky Cardinal." 
"If two more exquisite books than JAMES LANE ALLEN'S 
' A Kentucky Cardinal,' with its sequel, 'Aftermath,' have 
been written this year, they have certainly not been published. 
Marked by all the skill and intuition of his previous books, 
there is added to them something more appealingly human. A 
continual smile is upon your lips as yon read, which breaks now 
and then into mute laughter, but tears are not far away. The 
little volumes lie very close to the heart." Cincinnati Tribune.

HEROINE AND FOIL IN MODERN 
FICTION. 

Among the dramatis personce of earlier 
novels of character, there are usually four dis- 
tinct types, the hero and the villain, the 
heroine and the feminine contrast, often desig- 
nated by critics as " the foil." The villain of 
either sex has largely lost his identity in more 
recent fiction, a demise deeply mourned in 
clever essay by Miss Repplier and Mr. Lang. 
In current fiction, the hero and villain are 
sometimes indistinguishable to a casual reader, 
even when the author intends a subtle moral 
contrast. The modern villain has become a 
psychic and ethical study, not a plain criminal ; 
he seems merely one reflex of this unstable and 
speculative Zeitgeist. We have few sharp 
contrasts like those of past fiction, Parson 
Adams and Blifil, Nicholas Nickleby and 
Squeers, Captain Dobbin and the Marquis of 
Steyne, Earnshaw Hindley and Heathcliff. 

A similar metamorphosis has taken place in 
the relations of heroine and foil. Perhaps more 
marked still is the change in the heroine her- 
self. The " pale-lily " type, the demure, lov- 
ing, suffering, opinion-shunning girl, has been 
succeeded by the athletic, efficient woman "with 
a purpose." She may incidentally study the 
mirror, not that she may become a mere joy to 
her lover's eyes, rather that she may find more 
potent means of " wielding power." Clarissa 
Harlowe, Anne Eliot, Amelia Sedley, bear scant 
resemblance to their younger heroine-sisters, 
Diana Warwick, Marcella Boy ce, Glory Quay le, 
and Isabel Carnaby. While the earlier hero- 
ines were largely of one type, these later women 
'are as diverse and paradoxical as the phases of 
modern life. They differ radically in person- 
ality, accomplishments, tenets of faith, but they 
are all self-reliant, brave, alert women. 

In earlier Victorian character-novels, the 
author's ideal woman was in marked contrast 
to a weak or unwomanly foil. Charlotte 
Bronte, revealing her own reserve and sub- 
merged passion in her heroines, Jane Eyre and 
Lucy Snowe, humbly serving boorish, selfish 
men, found foils in the type hated by her, 
the beautiful, vain schemers, Blanche Ingram 
and Ginevra Fanshawe. Charlotte Bronte's 



270 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



heroines had Agatha's lowly aspiration, 

" Command was service ; humblest service done 
By willing and deserving souls was glory." 

George Eliot, like Charlotte Bronte, reflected 
not alone her ideals for women but much of 
her own personality in her heroines. All her 
great novels contain two antithetical women. 
Maggie and Lucy, Dinah and Hetty, Komola 
and Tessa, Dorothea and Rosamond, Gwendo- 
len and Mirah, they pass two by two in mem- 
ory ! And these heroines, with their strong 
intellectual ambitions, their spiritual doubts, 
their renunciations and their sufferings, are 
progressive revelations of their creator. The 
foils from Hetty to Rosamond represent the wo- 
men of mental or moral weakness. All George 
Eliot's women had throbbing emotional na- 
tures : her words on Dorothea have wide applica- 
tion, " All Dorothea's passion was transfused 
through a mind struggling towards an ideal life; 
the radiance of her transfigured girlhood fell 
on the first object that came within its level." 

Thackeray kept two distinct index-lists for 
his women. The immortal Becky Sharp, whose 
adroitness and wit command our admiration, 
despite her defective moral sense, was a defiant 
contrast to Amelia. Becky Sharp had two 
sisters of milder adventurous trend, all names 
begin with B, Beatrix and Blanche. Bea- 
trix is a wonderful creature, " whose eyes were 
fire, whose look was love, whose voice was the 
sweetest low song "; Blanche Amory, foil in 
"Pendennis," was embodiment of sentimen- 
tality and sham, who declared, " If I cannot 
have emotions, I must have the world." These 
foils are so much more alluring than their con- 
trasting heroines, Amelia, Isabel, and Laura. 
Thackeray chose some apt, correlative epithets 
for Laura which well describe his heroines as 
a class, " fair and open, kindly and pious, 
cheerful, tender, and true." With all these 
virtues, how uninteresting they are beside the 
clever, selfish, slightly wicked foils ! Is it a 
silent comment upon the changing morals of" 
the present that his foils attract us more than 
his heroines? Is it not rather because his 
master-touch of delineation is far more skilful 
and potent in the complex studies of life ? 

Mr. George Meredith, with his long service 
to literature and his wealth of women-charac- 
ters, represents both the older and the later 
types of heroines and foils. " Khoda Fleming " 
and " Richard Feverel " present women of the 
past ; gradually the novelist evolved his chosen 
heroine, a woman of intellectual power. 
Mark his statement, " A woman of intellect is 



as good as a Greek statue." Diana, Clara, 
Cecilia, with their mastering wit and poise and 
cognizance of state affairs, represent an ex- 
treme Amazonian type of women, whose coun- 
terparts are existent to-day in England and 
America. In " Rhoda Fleming " the antithesis 
is strongly marked between the perverse, strong 
Rhoda, and her weaker but more attractive sis- 
ter, Dahlia. In " Richard Feverel," the heroine 
is environed by a group of varied women, the 
hypochondriac Clare, the boyish Carola, the 
faddish, strong-minded Lady Judith, the adven- 
turess Bella, and the immortal Mrs. Berry, with 
her maxim, " Kissing do n't last ; cookery do." 

Racial traits have been media for contrasts. 
In earlier fiction Hawthorne thus compared 
Miriam and Hilda. In the same way Mrs. 
Ward found a foil for the thoroughly English 
Dora in the French Elise, though for purposes 
of testing David Grieve she added a moral inse- 
curity to the keenness and charm of her foil. 
Peculiar training and inheritance also afford 
this novelist careful character-studies, in the 
intellectual, graceful Laura at Bannisdale and 
her foil Polly Mason, with her " fringe of hair " 
and her " crackling lemon-coloured gloves." 

George Gissing has given modern fiction 
some matchless women-characters in his pow- 
erful realism. In the volume with the apt title, 
"The Odd Women," the author has drawn with 
subtle irony the purposeful, independent Rhoda, 
propagating the gospel of woman's emancipa- 
tion, yet, with her " lofty mission," she is still 
an erratic, jealous woman. Mary Barfoot is 
the wise character who says to the misguided 
heroine, " Guard yourself, Rhoda. To work 
for women, one must keep one's womanhood." 
In recent American fiction the strongly dis- 
tinctive girl, with national spirit, has her foil in 
the woman of foreign education and standards. 
Thus Mrs. Atherton emphasized her heroine, 
Lee Tarleton, in "American Wives and English 
Husbands." Again, in " Good Americans," Mrs. 
Harrison portrays the home-bred, earnest Aga- 
tha, versus Sybil with foreign focus and customs. 

American women are of such varied types 
that they defy any exclusive classification. 
Some novels and contes content themselves with 
one or two distinctive portraits, while others 
are overcrowded with dissimilar characters, yet 
all possess the distinctive traits of the Ameri- 
can woman, alertness, adaptability, ambition, 
force. Miss Wilkins and her co-workers have 
depicted the old-time New England woman with 
a " conscience," which was sometimes a mis- 
nomer for obstinacy, and her foil in the weak

sentimental " spinster," with a latent poetic 
faculty. Miss Pool had a wider range of char- 
acter than the other New England conteurs ; 
in " Red-Bridge Neighborhood " she draws a 
fine contrast between the strong, loyal, wise 
heroine Olive and her rival, the vain, coquet- 
tish Isabel Keating. Mr. Howells has as sure 
a grasp of American womanhood as he has of 
other phases of national life. Provincial Lydia 
Blood was his pioneer among the self-reliant, 
sensible, unpolished American girls who have 
been given stronger development in Cynthia 
Whitwell, at " Lion's Head," and Clementina, 
the " Ragged Lady." With coeval progression 
he has depicted his " Gallery of Nervous Wo- 
men," from crude, high-strung Marcia Gay- 
lord to Louisa Maxwell, whose jealous caprices 
retarded and complicated "The Story of a 
Play." Can we deny that both types are truly 
representative of modern American women ? 

Mr. Hopkinson Smith has photographed a 
delightful quartet of American women in 
" Caleb West." With characteristic chivalry 
he has made each a heroine ; Mrs. Leroy and 
Helen Shirley of society life are no more real 
and individual than simple, kindly " Aunty 
Bell " and pathetic little Betty. The American 
matron is too strong a type to be passed by in 
fiction. In " The Story of an Untold Love " 
she stands in the shadow, Donald's mother, the 
home-wrecking, ambitious type. Miss Lilian 
Bell, who has an acute vision of modernity, has 
made the prominent character in " The Under- 
side of Things " an American woman of strong 
yet unlovely nature. A vivid realism and 
morale commingle with the satire on Mrs. 
Copeland's nose, a " Code of Public Morals ": 
" After one critical look at her nose you knew 
why, when she sent a sick friend a potted plant, 
she asked her to return the pot, or, if she sent 
her jelly, she asked her to return the glass." 
Of quite dissimilar type is the woman physician, 
Dr. Isabelle Herrick, made attractive by Mr. 
Garland in " Rose of Dutcher's Coolly." Of 
all American novels presenting vivid contrasts, 
none surpass Mr. Warner's sequential studies 
of city-life. The conception of Carmen Eschelle, 
who, as a girl, was " both entertaining and en- 
terprising," and who liked " to drive very near 
the edge," with her subtle evil influence in " A 
Little Journey," her moral apathy and legal 
crime in " The Golden House," and her cul- 
minating ambition and downfall in " That For- 
tune," forms a vivid and fo'rceful character- 
sermon. In each book she acts as foil to a 
woman of pure, noble character. She can 



exert a malign influence upon Margaret in the 
first story, but she finds resistance in the loyal 
reliant Edith Delancy of " The Golden House." 
Perhaps her best contrast is in the last sequel, 
in the character of her own pure, steadfast 
daughter, Evelyn. Mr. Warner is always keen 
in his satire upon the vacillating tendencies of 
the " new woman." In " That Fortune " he 
finds Celia Howard " a type of the awakened 
American woman, who does not know exactly 
what she wants. . . . She ... is distracted by 
the many opportunities. She has no sooner taken 
up one than she sees another that seems better." 

In modern fiction the representative women 
are strong physically as well as mentally. They 
are not alloyed to " enjoy poor health " in 
modern life or current novel. A desire for 
vital, salutary, health of body and mind char- 
acterize the woman of to-day, and these quali- 
ties appear in her fictitious portrait. The 
marvellous vigor and endurance of Helen Sher- 
wood, the editor-heroine in " The Gentleman 
from Indiana," impart a freshness and charm to 
a story that lacks many qualities of structure. 

A recent lecturer divided the modern woman 
into two categories, " the woman who thinks 
and the woman who feels." Each class, with 
restrictions, has furnished material for novel- 
ists. If Richardson, Dickens, and Thackeray 
were disposed to apotheosize feeling and cari- 
cature intellectual cravings, George Eliot, 
George Meredith, and Mrs. Ward have canon- 
ized the woman of intellect and purpose versus 
the sentimental and rhapsodic type. In the 
evolution of educated womanhood, however, 
brain and heart must keep apace ; the woman 
who approximates an ideal heroine for a repre- 
sentative novelist and his clientele will both 
" think and feel." Her foil, seldom now in 
very sharp antithesis and varied in traits, is the 
woman who " thinks," or schemes, to the det- 
riment of healthy emotions ; or, on the other 
hand, she is the woman who " feels " without the 
exercise of trained mind and poised judgment.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



ART FOR MORALITY'S SAKE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While insisting that " in the final synthesis, beauty 
and truth and virtue are one and the same thing," and 
that " the ' art's sake ' shibboleth appears but a question- 
begging phrase," your leading article, " The Artist and 
the Man," in the current number of THE DIAL comes 
perilously near to asserting, in the fashion of the day, 
that the only art is Art for Morality's sake. This, it 
would seem, is a more dangerous position than the one 
which is there sought to be overthrown, i. e., the position 
of those who hold to " Art for Art's sake." 

This latter phrase means different things to different 
minds. As a cloak for the expression of moral obliquity, 
it is an abomination. As an excuse for ignoring the 
canon that the highest art conceals art, it is the plea of 
artists who are not artists. But as meaning something 
different from Art for Morality's sake it is not obnox- 
ious to criticism, in so far as it implies that the one 
essential thing in a work of art is its artistic quality and 
not its moral nor intellectual nor spiritual nor emotional 
nor imaginative nor any other quality taken by itself. 
In this latter sense it is surely the basis for a sound and 
proper criticism. Of these two positions, art for mere 
art's sake is possible, art for mere morality's sake incon- 
ceivable ; and a breadth of view which requires that form 
and substance, matter and manner, outward sign and 
inward grace, all be taken into account, is the only true 
critical position. 

Yet in the academic criticisms passed upon recent 
poets it is fairly evident that the idea implied in Art 
for Morality's sake is gaining ground. To teachers the 
didactic quality of literary work is necessarily precious, 
and the professional point of view dominates. A poet 
who teaches, even though his didactic merit far exceed 
his poetic merit, is too often given the artistic rank 
which belong to his betters, i. e., to those who are poets 
first and teachers afterward. No rational man doubts 
that the artist who has moral quality in addition to all 
the other qualities which go to make the true poet, is by 
so much the greater, any more than one doubts that, 
other things being equal, the poet whose numbers have 
the greater intellectual content is the greater poet; but 
this is quite different from the assumption that writers 
of verses which charm by their craftsmanship rather 
than by their moral or intellectual qualities are to be 
denied the very name of artist. There is no more rea- 
son why poetry should be statedly moral than that 
morality should be statedly poetic : beauty and charm 
and rational amusement have ethical significance, as 
your article avers. 

Goethe's dictum, " read the work through the man," 
and the various quotations from Ruskin, are less than 
half a truth, and the complementary, " read the man 
through his work," does not make it a whole one. When 
the art of the man greatly transcends his moral char- 
acter, no one holds to either or to both. Turner was 
utterly depraved, even in his art, so that scores of his 
pictures were given to the flames after his death; but 
Ruskin could still praise his better work extrava- 
gantly. When your article speaks of " giving full ac- 
ceptance as poetry to the work of men whose character 
we may not call unblemished," it admits away the case, 
even though it says straightway that " it would add 
distinctly to our satisfaction could we know them to 



have lived lives in stricter consonance with their ideals." 
The need for this justice charity it is not may be 
said to have been proved in such a work as " The 
Insanity of Genius," even though its author failed in his 
main contention. 

But these things, after all, have to do with history 
and biography rather than with literary criticism as 
such, and are useful in settling the status of the dead 
rather than in adjudging the work of the living. If we 
hold, as so many do, that literary art is given primarily 
for instruction, we extol the preacher at the expense of 
the artist and, in so far, make art difficult. Who goes 
to the length of giving Mr. Sheldon rank over Mr. 
Meredith ? Yet there was once a controversy over the 
comparative merit of Tennyson and Tupper, and there 
is to-day a pronounced disposition to apotheosize 
Browning the Teacher at the expense of Browning the 
Poet, and to deprecate Tennyson the Teacher because 
he never lost sight of his calling as a Poet. 

Probably the critical pendulum which had once swung 
so far toward the position of Art for Art's sake that, 
as your article says, " it seemed to hold the field against 
its opponents," has now gone near the other end of its 
arc in contending for Art for Morality's sake.

BRINTON MEMORIAL CHAIR IN THE UNIVER- 
SITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Scholars the world over are appreciative of the 
achievements of the late Daniel Garrison Brinton, for 
he established on a firm basis the branches of learning 
to which he devoted his life. He is justly named the 
" Founder of American Anthropology." 

A close student of the intricate problems of his 
science, he possessed the rare art of clearly and con- 
cisely presenting facts at their true values. He be- 
lieved in " the general inculcation of the love of truth, 
scientific, verifiable truth," and that knowledge should 
subserve usefulness. 

A keen observer, a classical scholar, an adept in the 
methods of logic and philosophy, Dr. Brinton had ever 
the practical application of truth in view. To the sys- 
tematic study of man he brought to bear his all-rounded 
culture to further the happiness and fullness of the in- 
dividual life. He regarded the individual as the start- 
ing point and goal of anthropology. Upon individual 
improvement, he claimed, depended group or racial 
improvement, social amelioration, and the welfare of 
humanity. 

It is proposed in recognition of the great services he 
rendered to the world by his teachings, numerous pub- 
lications, and untiring zeal in unearthing the false and 
proclaiming the true, to establish in his memory a 
Brinton Chair of American Archaeology and Ethnology 
in the University of Pennsylvania. This proposition has 
received the universal commendation and approval of 
anthropological scholars both in Europe and America. 

At the Memorial Meeting the plan was favorably 
mentioned and grateful recognition accorded to Dr. 
Brinton's unselfish devotion to his chosen life work. 
Provost Harrison thought that to honor his memory no 
more worthy tribute- could be given than the founda- 
tion of a Brinton Memorial Chair in the University of 
Pennsylvania. Professor Putnam, following these re- 
marks, said that he trusted the suggestion would not be

dropped but that something tangible would come from 
Provost Harrison's words. 

The choice of this place for the seat of the Brintou 
Memorial seems especially appropriate, since the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania now possesses Dr. Brinton's 
valuable library, his own gift shortly before his death. 
The association of Brinton's name with the University 
from 1886, when the chair of American Archaeology 
and Linguistics was created for his occupancy, may in 
this way be made permanent. In order to accomplish the 
proposed plan, it will be necessary to secure an endow- 
ment of fifty thousand dollars from individual sources. 

Patrons of science and others interested in the en- 
dowment may apply to the Brinton Memorial Commit- 
tee, 44 Mount Vernon Street, Boston, Mass., where 
further information is to be obtained if desired. Messrs. 
Drexel & Co., bankers, Philadelphia, have kindly con- 
sented to act as treasurers on certain conditions which 
will be explained to contributors on application to the 
Brinton Memorial Committee.

"THE TROUBADOURS AT HOME." A WORD 

FROM THE AUTHOR. 
( To the Editor of THB DIAL. ) 

Your review of " The Troubadours at Home," in your 
issue of March 16, is evidently from a thoughtful and 
conscientious critic, and I have read it with particular 
interest, but it contains one inadvertence which it may 
possibly be worth while to have pointed out. 

The writer speaks of " the author's failure to achieve all 
the ends that he proposed to himself." What this failure 
is, a previous sentence explains: " The world of the trou- 
badours has not risen clear, firm, coherent, and substan- 
tial in our minds. ... Its parts are left too scattered," 
etc. In my preface, page vii., are these words: "No 
attempt has been made, of course, to present anything 
like a complete account of the world of the troubadours, 
that alone would have required all the space at my 
disposal." That the parts are " scattered " follows from 
a fact explained elsewhere in the preface: while, as the 
reviewer says, a great deal of material of this kind is 
introduced, it is a means and not an end ; it is employed 
to make a background for the troubadours, and as these 
are treated one by one it is naturally divided up among 
them. 

Of course I am sorry to be represented in your influ- 
ential review as failing in an attempt to do something 
which for good reasons, as I thought I deliberately 
refrained from doing; but I cheerfully recognize that 
the critic's fault consisted only in being human. 

JUSTIN H. SMITH. 
Boston, Mass., April 2, 1900. 

[The point of the reviewer's objection was not 
that Professor Smith had failed "to present a 
complete account of the world of the troubadours," 
but such an account as would make their world 
clear, credible, living, and real to the imagination. 
It seemed to him that Professor Smith had but 
imperfectly realized the purpose indicated in the 
words of his preface, " to constitute an environment 
and an atmosphere for the poets," and to induce 
with regard to " the life, the events, the localities, 
and the personalities " of the time " a sense of actu- 
ality," and the reviewer endeavored to suggest an 
explanation of this lack of success. EDK. DIAL.] 



AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I^ADY OF 
CONSEQUENCE.* 

Two volumes of bulky dimensions and aris- 
tocratic mien are devoted to the records of a 
rarely favored and happy life. Its chief inci- 
dent was its smooth and sunny course through 
the successive periods of childhood, girlhood, 
mature and declining womanhood. It is a 
pleasant story for the thought to dwell upon, 
so bright a contrast does it offer to the usual 
transcript of mingled joy and sorrow that 
checker human experience. Lady Stanley 
seems scarcely to have known the meaning of 
privation, of denial, of disappointment of any 
sort. If a shadow did at any time fall athwart 
her path, it passed so quickly, its effect was so 
faint and transient, it failed to find a special 
mention in the details of her voluminous cor- 
respondence. The knowledge that lives may 
be thus fair on every side is the communication 
of value she has to convey to her readers. 

Maria Josepha Holroyd was born in the 
ranks of the English nobility. Her father, 
Lord Sheffield of Sussex, was a man of consid- 
erable parts and of active influence, as a mem- 
of Parliament and of the Privy Council, and 
as a County Magistrate. His pronounced lit- 
erary tastes and his generous heart secured him 
the friendship of persons of distinction and 
culture whom he loved to gather under the 
hospitable roof of Sheffield Place. The .his- 
torian Gibbon was one of these with whom he 
was bound by life-long ties of affection. His 
oldest daughter, Maria, a lively, precocious 
child, was early brought into a forward place 
through her own sprightly and attractive qual- 
ities, and the delicate state of her mother's 
health, which threw upon her much of the re- 
sponsibility of entertaining her father's guests. 

Her first letters preserved in the published 
collection, written at the age of eleven and 
twelve, display the ease and confidence of a 
full-grown woman of her time. She was evi- 
dently in training as a lady of consequence, 
with lessons from private masters to perfect her 
in all desirable feminine arts and accomplish-

ments. Her aunt, to whom the greater number 
of her epistles was addressed, as a privileged 
mentor urges upon her the following popular 
sentiment : " Beauty in a woman is of no con- 
sequence, but a good carriage, a strait shape, 
and genteel person, mark the well-educated, and 
seem to me as necessary for a woman of any 
fashion as to know how to spell." That Maria 
had beauty with her other engaging qualities 
is attested by the portraits taken at different 
stages of life, which are interspersed among her 
letters in the volumes before us. 

The young girl reflected credit upon her 
family. She was amiable, spirited, and high- 
bred, although from her aunt's gentle admoni- 
tions we suspect her of a little more brusqueness 
and independence in thought and manner than 
accorded with the standard of polite society. 
Her time was divided between the town and 
the country, five months of the year in London 
and seven months at Sheffield Place. In either 
residence she enjoyed intimate relations with 
the representatives of British aristocracy. One 
summer of her girlhood was spent at Lousanne, 
to which her family had resorted for the sake 
of renewed companionship with Mr. Gibbon. 
Here as elsewhere she was in contact with per- 
sons of social and literary eminence. 

With her parents she was entertained at 
Coppet, the home of the Neckers in their exile 
from Paris. Of M. Necker she writes : 

" I never saw anything so broken-hearted as he ap- 
pears to be. He speaks very little. Papa got a little 
conversation upon Folitiks with him, while we were 
walking ; but he does not join at all in general conver- 
sation. Madam Necker is very learned, as you know, 
and talked a great deal with Mr. Gibbon upon subjects 
of literature. She is rather a fine woman ; much painted, 
and, when she is not painted, very yellow, but upon the 
whole better looking than I expected. Necker is a very 
vulgar looking man. . . . Madam de Stael was there ; she 
is uglier than Lady K. Douglas; but so lively and enter- 
taining that you totally forget in five minutes whether 
she is handsome or ugly. They seem to be very fond of 
one another. Madam de Stael is perfectly wild, and must 
keep up her Papa and Mama's spirits very much." 

The young lady seldom bestows as many 
consecutive sentences upon any person or sub- 
ject as she has done in the above instance. 
Her comments are made with a swift touch and 
go that too often cheats the awakened interest 
of its due satisfaction. A large part of the 
period covered by the correspondence was 
marked by extraordinary unrest throughout 
Europe owing to the revolution in France and 
the subsequent domination by Napoleon. The 
writer makes constant allusions to the disturb- 
ances on the continent and to the anxieties in 
England, from which one gains a vivid impres- 



sion of the prevailing uneasiness of feeling. 

The letters comprising the first volume ex- 
tend to the year 1796, when at the age of 
twenty-five Miss Holroyd exchanged her care- 
ful life in her father's house for the duties and 
obligations of wife of the first Lord John 
Stanley of Alderley. Her new estate brought 
merely an increase of happiness. The union 
of the young couple was ideal, and during the 
fifty years through which it endured the mutual 
devotion of the wedded pair suffered no dimi- 
nution. Eleven children were born to them, 
one of whom passed away in its childhood. Its 
loss was undoubtedly mourned in the mother's 
heart, but there is no mention of it in her letters. 
They continue uninterrupted in their lively ac- 
count of days of unvarying enjoyment of the 
good things lavished unstintedly upon her. 
There seems from them to have been no room 
in the environment of Lady Stanley for the 
sorrows of ordinary mortals to creep in. 

Lord Stanley was given to intellectual pur- 
suits. Every advantage had been afforded him 
in youth for education in schools and in foreign 
travel. He had profited by his privileges, and 
with a well-stored mind and studious tastes he 
preferred the life of a quiet country gentleman 
to the public career his rank and abilities could 
well have commanded. He lent dignity and 
weight to his name, yet it remained for Arthur 
Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster, the 
son of his only brother, Edward, Bishop of Nor- 
wich, to give it an eminence which the wide 
world recognizes. 

The opulent volumes of Lady Stanley's Let- 
ters are enriched by portraits of herself and 
various members of her family. They were 
comely personages without exception, their 
faces beaming with intelligence and the refine- 
ment which is the heritage of noble birth and 
gentle breeding. SARA A. HUBBARD. 



A CYCLOPAEDIA OF AMERICAN

combination of scientific training, practical ex- 
perience, and attractive style. His publica- 
tions have been remarkably numerous, but they 
have all been " on the way " toward his great 
Cyclopaedia, the first volume of which has just 
been issued. 

In 1881 Henderson's " Handbook of Plants" 
was published, in one volume, with a second 
edition in 1890 ; and this has been the only 
cyclopedic work on horticulture published in 
America. It has long been in Professor Bai- 
ley's mind to make a complete record of the 
status of American horticulture, and its appear- 
ance at the close of the nineteenth century 
seems to be particularly appropriate. Now 
that the first volume is before us, the great 
wealth of American horticulture comes as a 
surprise. In American horticultural writings 
it has been the custom to draw too heavily from 
the experience of the Old World. Professor 
Bailey says that this was necessary once, but 
that now it is time to break away. Accord- 
ingly, the Cyclopaedia is distinctly American 
in its flavor, fully setting forth American ex- 
perience and conditions. As North America 
is a land of outdoor horticulture, emphasis is 
laid upon the hardy fruits, trees, shrubs, and 
herbs, rather than upon the glasshouse and 
fanciers' plants which occupy the chief atten- 
tion of most works. 

The editor aptly says that " the most diffi- 
cult part of the making of a cyclopedia is to 
project it. Its scope and point of view must 
be determined before a stroke of actual work 
is done. This much done, the remainder is 
labor rather than difficulty." The first para- 
graph of the Preface tersely states the editor's 
aim : 

" It is the purpose of this work to make a complete 
record of the status of North American horticulture as 
it exists at the close of the nineteenth century. The 
work discusses the cultivation of fruits, flowers, and 
garden vegetables, describes all the species which are 
known to be in the horticultural trade, outlines the hor- 
ticultural possibilities of the various states, territories, 
and provinces, presents biographies of those persons 
not living who have contributed most to the horticul- 
tural progress of North America, and indicates the 
leading monographic works relating to the various 
subjects." 

To compile a cyclopaedia by using other 
standard works involves drudgery, but presents 
no special difficulties, and results in no special 
merits. It is hack work, and necessarily in- 
volves neither expert service nor skill in pre- 
sentation. In short, it is the dull pigeon-holing 
of facts more or less trustworthy. Upon open- 
ing Professor Bailey's Cyclopaedia, however, 



one is introduced into an atmosphere totally 
different. It is the atmosphere of expert work, 
organized by one who is strong and original, 
and who has a genius for fresh and telling pre- 
sentation. The work is new from start to fin- 
ish, both in text and illustrations, and the long 
list of collaborators represents the most expert 
assistance. Horticulturists and botanists by 
the score have responded to the requests of the 
editor for help, and when the final list of col- 
laborators is published in the fourth volume it 
will probably make a roster of the leading hor- 
ticulturists and botanists of North America. 

The illustrations, too, deserve special men- 
tion for the happy combination of scientific and 
artistic excellence, and it has been one of the 
rules of the " make-up " that wherever the 
book opens an engraving will be seen. In this 
part of the work a dozen artists have been em- 
ployed in various horticultural centres to draw 
plants as they grow. 

Some conception of the details which enter 
into a cyclopedia of horticulture may be ob- 
tained from some of the following items : 

"More than 10,000 species of plants in cultivation; 
almost every important species phenomenally variable, 
sometimes running into thousands of forms; every spe- 
cies requiring its own soil and treatment, and sometimes 
even minor varieties differing in these requirements; 
limitless differences in soils and climates in our great 
domain, every difference modifying the plants or their 
requirements; a different ideal in plant-growing and 
plant-breeding in the mind of every good grower; as 
many different kinds of experience as there are men; 
many of these men not facile with the pen, although 
full of wholesome fact and experience; the species de- 
scribed in books which deal with the four corners of 
the earth; very few botanists who have given attention 
to the domestic flora." 

One can make no selections from a work con- 
taining such a vast amount of miscellaneous 
material, but perhaps the best idea of it can be 
obtained by stating what one can find in it. 
One interested in horticulture can find any 
group of plants in cultivation, probably a genus. 
The genus is described in a general way, its 
essential characters, geographical range, and 
any notable uses being given. Then follows a 
synopsis of all the species in cultivation, with 
keys and brief descriptions, so that one may 
" run down " and determine any special plant, 
just as in an ordinary manual. Then full cul- 
tural notes follow, so that one may discover 
the best methods of handling his plant. Under 
the titles of the various states, territories, and 
provinces, one interested in horticulture finds 
the best possible information as to the horti- 
cultural possibilities of any region. In short,

to such an one the Cyclopaedia would seem to 
be a sine qua non. 

But the horticulturist is not the only one 
who has been looking for this great work. 
Professional botanists have been expecting it 
eagerly, for it is a mass of most valuable infor- 
mation, bringing together, as it does, into avail- 
able and properly edited form, the immense 
contributions of facts from horticulturists to 
the whole evolutionary doctrine. It enables the 
morphologist to know not only the form he is 
handling, but also what it has been made to do, 
and what promise there is in it for further re- 
sults. It is such works that will bring together 
professional horticulturists and professional 
botanists. They need each other badly, and 
such a student as Darwin was wise enough to 
see that horticulturists and breeders had been 
for years performing experiments upon a gi- 
gantic scale bearing upon the theory of descent. 

The editor has assured us that the second 
volume is going to be better than the first, not 
only in typography and cuts, but also in matter. 
The work was well under way before the organ- 
ization got down to the real way of doing 
things. One must write a book first in order 
to learn how to write it.

SOME INTERESTING STAGE 
MEMORABILIA.* 



It was Lawrence Barrett who truthfully re- 
marked : " The sculptor and the architect, the 
painter and the poet, live in their works which 
endure after them ; the actor's work dies when 
he dies." And to those who put into perma- 
nent form a record of the achievements of his- 
trionic notabilities who are worthy of our 
present thoughts and later memories, we owe a 
debt of gratitude. A rare biography, exe- 
cuted with remarkable fidelity, is the recent 
life of the Kendals, by Mr. T. Edgar Pember- 
ton. Direct, discriminating, and comprehen- 
sive, the book gives more than a mere personal 
sketch, in the picture of the times and condi- 
tions in which their work has been accom- 
plished. 

William Hunter Grimston, the son of an 
artist, was born in London on December 16, 
1843. Though educated for the medical pro- 
fession, he drifted at an early age into theat- 
rical life; and in 1861 a hitherto unknown 

*THB KENDALS : A Biography. By T. Edgar Pemberton. 
New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



" Mr. Kendall " figured in the bills of the Koyal 
Soho (now the Royalty Theatre) as Louis XIV. 
in a play called " A Life's Revenge." The 
stage was not recognized at that time as one of 
the artistic professions and it was customary to 
use an assumed name. Kendal, owing to its 
resemblance to the famous theatrical name of 
Kemble, thus owes its existence. Mr. Kendal's 
advance was slow and gradual. After his con- 
nection with the famous Haymarket company, 
the battle was half won ; the other half was 
within imperceptible reach when he joined for- 
tunes with Miss Margaret Robertson. From 
then on the course of his career is familiar to 
all students of the modern drama. He has 
endeavored throughout his work to elevate the 
stage and render it subservient to the great 
interests of society and morality. In the robust, 
manly, and poetical characters that he has been 
called upon to play, he has always seemed to 
portray 

" Courtliness, and the desire of fame, 
And love of truth, and all that makes a man." 

According to an authority on things theat- 
rical, the Marylebone Theatre bill for May 20, 
1854, was " The Orphan of the Frozen Sea "; 
and in this "Marie, a child," was represented 
by " Miss Robertson." Mrs. Kendal was then 
of such tender years that it was not easy, until 
this bill was adduced in evidence, to convince 
her at a later day that she had ever made the 
debut at all. Mr. Pemberton traces her career 
from then on down to " The Elder Miss Blos- 
som," that essentially human and sympathetic 
play in which the Kendals are now appearing 
in this country. Mr. William Archer voiced 
a popular sentiment when he said : " If we are 
to have a Lady Macbeth, a Volumnia, a Con- 
stance, in the present generation, Mrs. Kendal 
is the woman. Having been our Mrs. Jordan, 
why should she not become our Mrs. Siddons ? " 
There are few actresses on the contemporary 
stage who are so engrossed in their art as Mrs. 
Kendal. 

" The true actor," she says, " consciously or uncon- 
sciously, carries his art along with him. If I go out to 
a reception I am at work often unknown to myself. 
I see a certain woman is interested in a certain man ; 
is given either joy or grief through him. I watch her 
expression, I follow the play of nerve and muscle in 
her face, and thus I learn how the human face reveals 
the workings of the human soul." 

Mr. Kendal, likewise, has ideals, in the dra- 
matic sense, and lives near to them. He forms 
his own opinions on what he sees and hears ; 
and when he adopts anything, he adopts it, not 
because ipse dixit, but because of its intrinsic

merit. There is more than passing significance 
in this fact. In criticising any actor, or actress, 
it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate our 
impressions of the acting from our impressions 
of the person who acts. In every other art 
the finished work of the artist is embodied in 
a form quite distinct from the producer, and 
stands or falls by itself. For instance, to en- 
joy and properly appreciate the Fifth Sym- 
phony of Beethoven, it is not necessary to in- 
quire from whence he derived his inspiration 
to inquire into the motives which resulted 
in the finished work. In dramatic art, how- 
ever, all this is reversed. The actor embodies 
in his own person, before our eyes, the passions 
which he undertakes to represent ; they cannot 
be judged apart from him. Hence we have a 
yearning curiosity, as it were, to peep at his 
inner life to learn of the methods pursued 
by an actor which results in the culmination 
of his art. 

Regarding the stage as a career, Mrs. Ken- 
dal has expressed her opinion totidem verbis, 
and her views are of more than momentary 
interest : 

" I think acting is a most excellent field for young 
women, but it must be a field, not a pasture. It is not 
a pasture on which thousands can graze. Instead of 
having a hundred in the field we have ten thousand, and 
there is n't room for them all. Everybody nowadays 
wants to go upon the stage, and some may have advant- 
ages in the way of appearance and youth and education, 
but this particular art is not to be taught. Therefore, 
they may have good looks, they may have youth, they 
may have education, and yet have not acting. Acting 
is a thing that 's inside, not outside at all. The modern 
audience is apt to think that acting consists of outside 
attributes, but it is not so. Then again, when you can 
act and have made money, people are apt to call it luck. 
I have always been called a lucky woman, but I do n't 
think it 's all luck. I am vain enough to think that 
some of it is hard work very hard work constant 
and everlasting work. You must never cease to study. 
As you get older, you must fill up the wrinkles with 
intelligence." 

The volume contains many valuable views on 
subjects connected with the stage and on the 
present condition of the drama including 
Mrs. Kendal's much discussed paper on " The 
Drama," which was delivered by her at the 
congress of the National Association for the 
Promotion of Social Science. On the whole, 
Mr. Pemberton has succeeded in making his 
book interesting, as well as instructive ; it re- 
veals the author's familiarity with the stage 
and its history ; anecdote has been interspersed, 
though not too freely, with fact. We find in 
it little of that convenient omission and ignor- 
ing of dates which make many theatrical biog- 



raphies exasperating. There are a few, perhaps, 
who would have preferred to have had the book 
written from a more impartial standpoint 
by one other than a life-long friend of the 
Kendals. Had we waited for this, we would 
have never had an accurate record ; even as 
the present work was nearing completion, Mrs. 
Kendal grew nervous, declaring that except in 
the exercise of her art she had never courted 
publicity. 

" Write my husband's Life if you desire," she said, 
11 and only mention me as you would any other actress 
he has played with. His career should be written, and 
he does not mind, only ignore me as much as you pos- 
sibly can ! I prefer it." 

The words are characteristic of the woman 
she has invested her genius with greater love- 
liness by throwing over it the graceful mantle 
of humility. INGRAM A. PYLE. 



AN ENGLISHMAN ON ENGLAND AND 
THE BOERS.* 

The condemnation of England's course in 
the war with the two Republics comes with 
the most force from precisely that element 
in the United Kingdom which corresponds to 
the opponents of an imperialistic policy in the 
United States, and every Englishman who has 
expressed his open regret at the attempt to 
array America among " the sly freebooters of 
the Earth," is also outspoken in his denuncia- 
tion of England's course in the Transvaal. It 
seems to be true, also, that ignorance in both 
countries is the best support of imperialism, 
and the imperialistic press and censorship in 
England have adopted identically the same 
policy respecting South Africa that was adopted 
before them by the imperialistic press and cen- 
sorship of the United States respecting the 
Philippines : with rare exceptions, our cousins 
across the sea are following our vicious exam- 
ple to the letter. 

It is undoubtedly true that the average 
British subject in Hong Kong knows more 
about the Philippine war than any American 
not connected with Mr. McKinley's govern- 
ment, just as every American knows more about 
the South African war than any Englishman 
not connected with Mr. Chamberlain's govern- 
ment ; and the few exceptions only prove the 
universality of the rule. One of these excep- 
tions, in England, is Mr. John Atkinson

Hobson, M. A.Oxon., the well-known university 
extension lecturer and economist, and the au- 
thor of various books of moment. Mr. Hobsoii 
spent the summer and autumn of last year in 
South Africa for the purpose of familiarizing 
himself with the situation, and now sets forth, 
in " The War in South Africa," all that he 
could learn from both sides at first hand and by 
persistent and intelligent inquiry among all 
classes of people in the British colonies and the 
two Republics. The result is a calm, dispas- 
sionate marshalling of facts which gives the lie 
to every contention of the British Jingo, while 
it leaves a clear and striking impression of the 
many faults and weaknesses of the Transvaal 
under Mr. Krueger. 

The American public is too familiar with the 
various contentions to require their exposition 
here in any detail ; but it is well to say that no 
facts can be found to support the post bellum 
theory of the British Tory that there was ever 
any reason to fear an attempt on the part of 
the Dutch in any part of South Africa, whether 
Republicans or colonists, to wrest control from 
Great Britain of the government there ; and 
that the wild stories of wholesale corruption in 
Pretoria rest upon no assured basis of truth 
whatever, the merest rumor and slightest infer- 
ence being taken for facts to bolster up a 
wicked cause. 

And not merely wicked, but foolish ; for the 
concluding chapters of this interesting and 
thoroughgoing volume are devoted to an inquiry 
into the policy which Mr. Chamberlain and 
his fellow-imperialists must pursue after the 
present open hostilities have ceased. Mr. 
Hobson believes there will be a long period of 
guerilla warfare, and that the taking of Pre- 
toria will no more bring peace than the taking 
of Bloomfontein " it is doubtful," he says, 
" if we can spare the strength which will be 
needed for keeping the Boers of the Republics 
as a subject race." But, even assuming a firm 
settlement, what then ? 

" It will evidently work out in one of two ways," re- 
plies Mr. Hobson. " Either the Outlanders will be 
dominant as a political party, in which case the mining 
magnates, who have organized this attack, will rule the 
Transvaal as De Beers rules Kimberley, controlling the 
Outlander vote by economic force; or, if the old burgher 
party should remain more numerous, or should detach 
enough of the non-British Outlanders, then the British, 
whose flag floats at Pretoria, will find themselves out- 
voted at the polls, and; subjected to the practical control 
of their enemies, embittered by the memories of the 
war, and bent on every sort of constitutional reprisal. 
Such is one of the dilemmas which will be the legacy of 
this disastrous war: the choice between an oligarchy of 
financial Jews, and a restoration of Boer domination." 



Nor does that end the tale of the woes, like 
those of the Apocalypse, which are to follow 
the attempt to substitute catastrophe for evolu- 
tion and natural law on the part of the gold 
magnates, aided by Messrs. Rhodes and Cham- 
berlain. As Gladstone foresaw, as the repeated 
refusals of Sir A. Milner to convoke the Par- 
liament of the Cape Colony attest, the alterna- 
tive in the colonies confessedly British is 
fraught with equal danger to British prestige : 
it is government by " military despotism and 
Downing Street " on one hand, and government 
by the numerical majority of the Dutch on the 
other this latter case requiring that the Dutch 
be not alienated by the " long protracted period 
of coercion " which is even now frowning in the 
place of popular government. The outlook, 
black as it is to British imperialists, is white 
with hope for lovers of liberty, since British 
domination, based upon force, must end in 
South Africa, whether the issue of the present 
war be successful or not. Mr. Hobson's book 
is the most important contribution yet made to 
a most important subject. WALLACE RICE. 



THE IJETTERS OP CICERO.* 



The text and the chronological order of the 
correspondence of Cicero have received so 
much careful study of recent years that a com- 
plete English translation was as inevitable as 
desirable. But a good translation, faithful to 
the thought and tone of the original and in lucid, 
idiomatic English, was what was wanted ; and 
here inevitability and desirability ceased to 
keep company. For it must be said that both 
the English of Mr. Evelyn Shuckburgh's recent 
translation, and his rendering of the thought, 
leave much to be desired. 

From the standpoint of the English, there 
are two classes of faults frequent enough to 
invite criticism, an inaccuracy growing out 
of carelessness or bad training on the one hand, 
and an overstrained attempt to reproduce the 
easy familiarity of Cicero's epistolary style on 
the other. Under the first heading one meets 
such expressions as " five cohorts . . . having 
taken up its quarters," II. 101 ; " I came to 
the incident of Sestius, after receiving many 
wounds in the temple of Castor, having been 
preserved by the aid of Bestia," I. 216 ; " I 
have not been idle, and am not being idle now," 
I. 328 ; " What was (had) she to do with the

Latin feriae ? " 1. 10 ; " as far as can be as yet 
conjectured," I. 12-13. " Shall " and " will " 
are apparently regarded as universally inter- 
changeable, while "farther" and "farther- 
more " are used exclusively where any careful 
writer would employ " further " and " further- 
more." And even where one cannot allege 
specific grounds of offense, it is impossible to 
forget the words of Horace, " Vitavi denique 
culpam, Non laudem merui" 

Of course it would not do to transfer the 
easy epistolary Latin of Cicero and his corre- 
spondents into the English of serious and digni- 
fied literature, and it may be that the attempt to 
reproduce the peculiar tone of such Latin in- 
volves pitfalls beyond the detection of the most 
wary ; but as between overdoing and under- 
doing the assumed " familiarity " of the letters, 
the error of conservatism is to be preferred. 

To illustrate, M. Caelius Rufus writes to 
Cicero, " Ecquando tu hominem ineptiorem 
quam tuum Cn. Pompeium vidisti, qui tantas 
turbas, qui tarn nugax esset, commorit?" 
which is rendered, " Did you ever see a more 
futile person than your friend Pompey, for hav- 
ing stirred up all this dust, without any stuff 
in him, after all ? " The difficulty with such 
translation is that it recognizes no distinction 
between the absence of conscious attention to 
dignity of expression and the presence of a con- 
scious preference for " slang." In the same 
letter the words " Hdbeo autem quam multa " 
have not the slightest trace of anything below 
the dignity of the most serious and elevated 
literary art, and yet they are rendered, " And 
what a lot I have ! " 

Failures to catch the exact meaning of the 
Latin are much more numerous than the rec- 
ognized cases in which ambiguity in the text is 
admitted. A frequently recurring instance of 
this is the failure to recognize the so-called 
epistolary use of the Imperfect, Perfect, and 
Pluperfect tenses, so common in Cicero's letters 
and so entirely foreign to English letter- writing. 
All in all, we can but feel sorry that a trans- 
lation with so many flaws should have appeared 
and thus cut off the hope of a thoroughly good 
rendering for years to come. The ideal trans- 
lator of these letters should have an unusual 
mastery of English, and should then let his 
work go through the hands of experts in some 
half dozen different phases of the original text 
before submitting it to the public. As it is, 
we can only hope that the demand for this 
translation will be sufficient to justify an early 
and searching revision. -yy\ Ji. JOHNSON. 



MYTH AND FANCY OF ANIMAL, 
AND PLANT.* 

Mrs. Bergen's recent "Animal and Plant 
Lore " is a continuation of her " Current Super- 
stitions " published in 1896 as No. IV. of the 
Memoirs of the American Folklore Society. 
The earlier book was reviewed in THE DIAL at 
the time of its appearance. As this volume 
was already planned, beliefs regarding zoolog- 
ical or botanical objects were omitted from 
" Current Superstitions." The matter for both 
volumes was " collected from the oral tradition 
of English-speaking folk." Mrs. Bergen has 
been engaged for several years upon the present 
collection, which fairly represents the whole 
United States. European material (in situ) 
is intentionally excluded from the main text. 
The individual items of belief are numbered. 
The collection includes 1397 such items, of 
which 1127 are animal lore and the remaining 
270 are plant lore. From the animal list we 
may remove fifty-five numbers which present 
popular names of animals. These are inter- 
esting folk-lore, but not direct expressions of 
belief or superstition. 

To classify the mass of superstitions remain- 
ing is a difficult task. Mrs. Bergen recognizes 
thirteen classes which a folk-lore student 
might have been expected to avoid doing! 
These classes are : 

vii. Folk Medicine, 
viii. Various. 

PLANT LOBB. 
ix. Amulets, Charms, and 
Divinations. 
x. Omens, 
xi. Weather Signs, 
xii. Folk Medicine, 
xiii. Various. 

Some of these classes are subdivided : thus, 
the discussion of animal weather signs is divided 
into four subdivisions. Naturally it is difficult 
to always assign an item to its proper subdivi- 
sion. Still, it seems that this part of Mrs. 
Bergen's work might have been more carefully 
done. It is questionable whether witches are 
a part of animal lore : admitting them to be 
so, why is No. 56 inserted under the head of 
ghosts and witches, and why does it appear in 
a collection of animal lore ? It states " A 
man can spell a gun ' so that the gun will not 
hit anything." Why is No. 1180 called a 
divination? It runs "mountain ash, locally 
known as ' dogwood,' is used to make tillers of 
boats for luck.' ' No. 490, " The quail is

said to ' call for rain ' " is properly placed among 
animal weather signs ; why is not No. 652 
" ' More wet, more wet ' the robin is said to say 
before rain " put with it ? It is placed among 
Incantations and Formulae where it surely does 
not belong. We admit the difficulty in making 
proper location of these items ; but the greater 
the difficulty, the greater should be the care 
used. 

We cannot refrain from mentioning two 
other examples of similar carelessness. In a 
classified and numbered list of superstitions 
there should be no repetitions. Yet there are 
a considerable number. 502 and 646 are 
identical ; so are 653 with 654 and 495 ; so are 
355 and 676, 390 and 680 ; other cases might 
be pointed out. 653 with 654, identical with 
495, ought never to have been introduced into 
this collection of the lore of English-speaking 
folk. They are in an American Indian lan- 
guage. Either all such lore should be excluded 
or a real collection should be made from this 
astonishingly rich native field. 

The other point of criticism relates to a lack 
of system in the numbering. In 215 are given 
three variants of a common saying in reference 
to judging a horse offered for sale. They are 
more unlike than many variants which in other 
parts of the text are given distinct numbers. 
A fourth variant of this same saying is thrown 
into the notes instead of being placed in the text. 
Why ? (Perhaps it came to hand too late for 
proper incorporation ?) A still worse example 
of careless numbering is shown in the already 
objectionable Indian saying. In one place it 
appears as a simple saying and is given one 
number 495 : in another it is divided and 
two numbers are given it 653, 654. 

We have appeared far more critical than we 
feel. The collection is an interesting one ; the 
arrangement of the material is, on the whole, 
good. A valuable feature of the book is the 
section of Notes. These notes either give fur- 
ther information regarding the items in the 
main body of the text, or present similar be- 
liefs and superstitions from other chiefly 
European lands and languages. Mr. Joseph 
Bergen in an introduction throws out some 
hints and suggestions regarding the interest 
and bearing of the material. We wish that 
Mrs. Bergen had discussed some of the inter- 
esting groups of superstitions which she pre- 
sents : no one is better qualified than she to 
do so. 

We may query in closing whether much of 
what here is labeled superstition is not really 



true, or was not so formerly. Mr. Bergen himself 
suggests that there may be truth in some of the 
weather signs. No. 112J states a common no- 
tion regarding the manufacture of ammonia : 
the idea was amply justified by former methods. 
No doubt many items of folk-medicine are as 
serviceable as the recognized remedies of the 
physician ; there may be virtue in more of them 
than the critical folklorist admits. The use of 
animal oils in healing was formerly widespread. 
Mrs. Bergen gives an interesting presentation 
of this, in numbers 821-836. We were a little 
surprised to find no reference to the use of 
human fat in dressing wounds. The Spaniards 
in the Conquest of Mexico made constant use 
of the fat of slain Indians for this purpose. It 
will be strange indeed if Mrs. Bergen does not 
come upon some evidence that English-speaking 
folk also believe in its efficacy.

BIOLOGICAL, QUESTIONS OF TO-DAY.* 

A glance at recent biological literature will sug-

range of thought and the variety of topics under 
discussion in the theories and investigations of the 
natural sciences in these closing years of the century. 
Dominant in most of it, and environing all of it, is 
the idea of organic evolution of whose laws Darwin 
found the clue less than fifty years ago. The threads

cies," have been woven into a pleasing fabric by 
Dr. Shute in his " First Book of Organic Evolution." 
The author disclaims originality and makes no pre- 
tense of proving the truth of Evolution a welcome 
change. His aim, rather, has been to prepare an 
elementary introduction to the Development theory 
which should be " interesting and easily intelligible 
to the general reader." In this he has succeeded. 
'Classic illustrations are freely used, though the work 
is quite up to date in its scope and data. In fresh- 
ness, simplicity, and comprehensiveness the book 
leaves little to be desired in an elementary treatise. 
The discussion of biological phenomena of general 
interest, such as heredity, is especially complete, and 
this chapter is to be commended to those who wish 
a presentation of rival theories now contending for 
supremacy. An elementary treatment lends itself 
readily if indeed it does not demand dogmatic 
statement of propositions. On some subjects, as 
for example mimicry, recognition marks, and regen- 
eration, conclusions are stated with a positiveness 
which many would desire to qualify until experi- 
mental evidence had adequately justified the hy- 
pothesis. The colored plates made by the color 
printing process add greatly to the attractiveness 
and value of the work, and exemplify the applica- 
bility of this method to scientific illustration. 

A work with a somewhat similar aim is " Dar- 
winism and Lamarckism," by Captain Hutton of 
New Zealand University, who sets forth the present 
status of the discussion of the factors of organic 
evolution in a way " sufficiently clear to be under- 
stood at the first reading, and sufficiently short to 
discourage skipping." In this work the outlook is 
broader and the treatment less technical and more 
philosophical than it is in the book just mentioned. 
The author was one of the earliest advocates of 
Darwinism, and is still loyal to all the tenets of his 
master, candidly setting forth the arguments of the 
Lamarckians and the Neo Darwinian school only 
to oppose them and to return to the position of 
Darwin. The only contribution to the subject which 
the author brings forward as original is the idea 
that diversification of primitive pelagic life was 
occasioned by volcanic disturbances which caused 
local differences in the chemical constituents of the 
sea water. The author has succeeded admirably in 
preparing a well-balanced and logical presentation 
of Darwin's views in the light of current criticism, 
And his book easily ranks with the best of recent 
reviews of the subject for the general reader. 

The solution of a specific biological problem 
according to the principles of organic evolution is 
presented in Dr. R. F. Scharff's " History of the 
European Fauna," recently imported by Scribners 
as a volume of the " Contemporary Science Series." 
The author seeks to analyze the distribution of the 
existing European fauna, and to indicate the orig- 
inal sources of its component elements, by a careful 
examination of the distribution of previous faunas 
as shown in fossil remains and by correlation of the 
f aunistic chronology with geological changes which 



conditions the migration of animals. The origin of 
the fauna of the British Isles is in itself an inter- 
esting problem and one in which the author is well 
versed, so that we are not surprised to find this 
theme prominent in the book. Much of the evi- 
dence necessarily pertains to the group of verte- 
brates, the data regarding the distribution of inver- 
tebrates at present, and especially in the past, being 
very meagre. These limitations, however, do not 
deter the author from the attempt to trace the 
movements of the pre-historic fauna of Europe. 
The author recognizes an ancient contribution from 
the Arctic regions, and another from the Siberian 
steppes ; he also traces the invasion from the Orient 
and from Lusitauia, closing his work with a chapter 
dealing with the various explanations offered for 
the peculiarities of the Alpine fauna. 

The influence of biological thought has long been 
felt in the field of sociology, but owing to the ex- 
tent of the two sciences, few have attempted to 
make in detail an extended comparison of the opera- 
tion of the laws of organic evolution in the two fields. 
Various approaches have been made, it is true, but 
usually from the one side or the other. Under the 
stimulus of the Brussels Institute of Sociology, three 
specialists MM. Jean Demoor, Jean M assart, and 
Emile Vandervelde representing the sciences of 
zoology, botany, and sociology, have severally and 
jointly endeavored to trace and to illustrate the part 
that atrophy plays in the evolution of plant and ani- 
mal life and in the development of social institutions. 
By this coordination and combination of research, 
the authors hope to avoid the exaggerations which 
have led critics to declare the bankruptcy of bio- 
logical sociology. The work has been translated in 
a felicitous style by Mrs. Chalmers Mitchell, and 
constitutes the seventy-ninth volume of the " Inter- 
national Scientific Series." The authors content 
themselves with outlining the conception of society 
as an organism, developing no argument in the de- 
fense of this view, stating briefly the objections 
which may be raised to the rigid comparison of the 
operation of the laws of evolution in an organic 
aggregate bound together by the ties of physiolog- 
ical continuity and physical heredity, with the oper- 
ation of these laws in a social aggregate bound 
together principally by the bonds of mental relations 
and social heredity. Throughout the discussion the 
terms degeneration and atrophy are used in their 
broadest sense, and include some processes and some 
illustrations which lend themselves equally, if not 
preferably, to other categories. Granting that their 
comparisons can at the best give but analogies at 
least in the biological sense the authors proceed 
to the discussion of the universality of retrogressive 
processes in all modifications of organs and institu- 
tions. They show that degenerative evolution fol- 
lows no definite path and does not retrace the steps 
of progress to the primitive condition ; that an 
atrophied organ or institution never reappears, nor 
does it reassume its former or a new function ; and 
that degenerative evolution is brought about by a

limitation of the means of subsistence, the principal 
agents in biology being the struggle for existence 
between organs and organisms, while in sociology 
this is replaced by artificial selection. The work is 
broad in its conception, moderate in statement, 
scholarly in execution, and well merits a place in 
the " International Scientific Series." 

No single publication so promptly and adequately 
reflects the trend and scope of American biological 
work as does the annual volume of " Lectures " de- 
livered at the Marine Biological Laboratory at 
Woods Holl. The topics discussed in these lectures 
are usually of general interest, and frequently per- 
tain to the latest conclusions on fundamental prob- 
lems of natural science. The volume for 1898, for 
example, opens with a critical discussion of the 
physical structure of protoplasm, by Professor E. B. 
Wilson. Other papers follow which deal with the 
structure of cells, with the differentiation of the 
various organs of the embryo in the egg, and with 
the first indications of the planes of symmetry of 
the adult. The phenomena of cell-life and the 
problems of embryology do not, however, monopo- 
lize the work. Dr. Watase writes of " Protoplasmic 
Contractility and Phosphorescence," and Professor 
Morgan of " Some of the Problems of Regenera- 
tion " following mutilation and amputation in the 
lower animals. A statistical study of the " Elim- 
ination of the Unfit " among the introduced English 
sparrows at Providence, R. I., by the great storm 
of Feb. 1, 1898, affords Professor Bumpus the op- 
portunity to illustrate the action of natural selection. 
In previous studies he had shown that since intro- 
duction the English sparrow had developed a range 
of variation not found under the more vigorous 
conditions of European competition. His present 
work demonstrates that " natural selection is most 
destructive of those birds which have departed most 
from the ideal type, and its activity raises the gen- 
eral standard of excellence by favoring those birds 
which approach the structural ideal." Other papers 
deal with pain sensations in the lower animals, with 
the fossil mammals of North America, and with the 
contribution to biological thought of Caspar Fried- 
rich Wolff in the eighteenth century. The closing 
lecture by Professor C. O. Whitman is a scholarly 
discussion of " Animal Behavior " in a new and un- 
conventional method based upon extensive observa- 
tions upon leeches, mud-puppies, and pigeons. He 
traces the primary roots of instinct back to the con- 
stitutional properties of protoplasm, opposes the 
habit theory of its origin, and regards it as the 
actual germ of mind. The volume is a fitting ex- 
ponent of American biological scholarship; and 
although some of its pages are technical, there is 
much in it of greatest interest and stimulus to the 
reader and thinker who would be conversant with 
the biological thought of the day. 

At the age of eighty, Mr. Herbert Spencer has 
brought to a successful conclusion the revision of 
the second volume of his " Principles of Biology." 
The added matter in this volume is less extensive 



and less important than that made to the first vol- 
ume. It consists principally of minor changes in 
the text rendered necessary by the discoveries of 
recent years and of additions emendatory or ex- 
planatory of the original. One important chapter 
on " The Integration of the Organic World " is a 
generalization from the law of evolution in its most 
transcendental form which recognizes " something 
like a growing life of the entire aggregate of organ- 
isms in addition to the lives of individual organisms 
an exchange of services among the parts enhanc- 
ing the life of the whole." He proposes the term 
constitutional units for the ultimate particles of the 
germ plasm formerly designated as physiological 
units, but retains unmodified the " stress and strain" 
argument for the segmentation of the vertebrate 
animal, though this view is by no means generally 
accepted to-day by morphologists. 

For those who look upon man as the product of 
evolution, Mr. Charles Morris has prepared in his 
" Man and his Ancestor " a resume of the subject 
" to enable this class of readers to test the quality 
and sufficiency of their belief." Another reason 
given for this compilation of fact and theory, is the 
fact that nearly thirty years have elapsed since the 
publication of Darwin's " Descent of Man " and 
" Sexual Selection," and his work is to this extent 
antiquated. We fear, however, that the general 
public as well as the scientific world will be sur- 
prised to learn that Darwin's masterpieces " at best 
cannot be considered as well suited for general read- 
ing." The book affords a convenient summary but 
it is not complete ; for example, the discussion of 
vestigial organs ignores entirely Wiedersheim's ex- 
haustive treatise on " The Structure of Man"; nor 
is it critical in its acceptance of evidence. A con- 
troversial tone is apparent at times, and its pages 
abound in didactic and even dogmatic statement of 
the sheerest speculations ; for example, the chapter 
on " How the Chasm Was Bridged " presents not a 
figment of evidence, though it contains not a little 
of the stuff that dreams are made of. The author 
has woven his fact and fancy together in a very 
readable book, but we fear that contrary to his 
expectations it will only bring skepticism alike in 
the ranks of the believers and of the unbelievers. 

The study of botany in the home, or in the school- 
room where laboratory facilities are meagre, will 
be greatly facilitated by the suggestions of Dr. 
MacDougal's admirable little book, " The Nature 
and Work of Plants." It is intended as an intro- 
duction to the study of plants as active organisms, 
and treats of their various functions, illustrating 
them- by many simple experiments which anyone 
can perform. This method of approach is sure to 
incite and sustain the interest of the pupil, and has 
high educational value as a practical application of 
the experimental method to the elementary study of 
a biological science. 

" The Honey-Makers," by Miss Margaret Mor- 
ley, is written in a popular vein in the style of her 
previous books on natural history subjects T>

simple language she describes the structure of bees, 
their social organization, and the products of their 
industry from wax to hydromel. She then takes 
her readers far afield through the literature of 
India and the Orient, of Greece and Rome, and 
of Christian and Mediaeval times, in search of 
apian myth and fancy, but descends from the slopes 
of Hymettus to relate the curious customs and be- 
liefs that have gathered about the apiary, and to 
report the present status of bee-culture throughout 
the world. The book is thus not only a contribution 
to the natural history of the bee, but also a veritable 
literary compendium of the " little people." 

A sixth volume of the " Science Series " treats 
of " Bacteria," especially as they are related to the 
economy of nature, to industrial processes, and to 
public health. A work of this sort is much needed 
for popular information upon the scope, methods, 
and results of bacteriological science. Bacteria are 
omnipresent. " They occur in our drinking water, 
in our milk supply, in the air we breathe. They 
ripen cream and flavour butter. They purify sew- 
age and remove waste organic products from the 
land. They are active agents in a dozen industrial 
fermentations. They assist in the fixation of free 
nitrogen and they build up assimilable compounds. 
Their activity assumes innumerable phases and oc- 
cupies many spheres, more frequently proving them- 
selves beneficial than injurious. They are both eco- 
nomic and industrious in the best biological sense of 
the terms." The important part which bacteria play 
in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and in 
preventive medicine make an intelligent comprehen- 
sion of their activities imperative in all matters of 
public and private sanitation. Mr. Newman's dis- 
cussions of bacteria and disease, of immunity, of 
antitoxins, and of methods of disinfection, are illum- 
inating, and are to be commended to all seeking 
information on these points. Any discussion of 
bacteria will seem technical to the uninitiated, but 
all such will find in this book popular treatment and 
scientific accuracy happily combined.

SOME MUNICIPAL PROBLEMS AND 
PHENOMENA.* 



Dr. Weber has prepared, in his " The Growth of 
Cities," a very valuable compendium for students 
of urban populations. It is not a readable book 
except in the latter chapters, but it presents the 
chief statistical considerations for students of the 
subject. A very striking picture of the changes

wrought by the century is given in the contrast be- 
tween the distribution of the population of the 
United States in 1790, and of Australia in 1891, 
with a population numerically about the same. The 
contemporary United States show an increasing 
tendency to concentration. It is manifest that this 
tendency is largely due to modern methods of or- 
ganization, economic, social, and political : hence 
the third chapter gives the proper place to indus- 
trial activity as the chief cause of the concentration 
of the population. His study of vital statistics in 
cities presents the difficulties due to modern urban 
life, but gives a rather hopeful outlook for the 
future, due largely to transportation facilities, and 
the growth of suburban life. The book forms a 
very valuable scientific treatise. 

The Comptroller of New York has written an 
instructive little volume out of the wealth of his 
experience in the metropolis, " Municipal Govern- 
ment." Unless one has followed his career, the 
natural inquiry is, " Can anything good come out 
of Nazareth?" To have pointed criticisms and 
valuable constructive suggestions from a Tammany 
official is a novelty, but then Mr. Coler is himself 
a rara avis. It would be interesting, if space per- 
mitted, to apply the higher criticism to this volume. 
The author is so remarkably emancipated himself, 
and yet bears marks of bis association. He says : 

" There are too many departments, too many bureaus, 
and too many officers. Authority should be centralized, 
responsibility fixed beyond possibility of evasion, details 
of administration simplified, and the machinery of gov- 
ernment reduced to the smallest scale consistent with 
perfect operation. No matter what division may be 
made of the duties and powers of municipal adminis- 
tration, local government really reaches the people 
through four channels police, sanitation, public edu- 
cation, and taxation." 

This simplification of government does not, how- 
ever, restrict municipal functions to the four chan- 
nels mentioned, as Mr. Color himself recognizes 
when he comes to speak of new problems. The 
chief value of the book is in its criticism of the 
Greater New York Charter, which Mr. Coler says 
has been proven by practical experience to possess 
the weaknesses pointed out by the political scien- 
tists. 

" The bicameral Municipal Assembly, created by the 
charter, should be abolished. . . . The repeal of the 
chapter of the charter that created borough presidents 
will save to the tax-payers $51,300 a year, without in 
the slightest degree disturbing the general plan of gov- 
ernment. . . . Another experiment in the charter, the 
Board of Public Improvements, should be either abol- 
ished or modified. 

" There are four Police Commissioners and one Fire 
Commissioner, one Commissioner of Highways, and 
three Commissioners of Docks and Ferries. Eleven or 
twelve commissioners at $5,000 a year could be dis- 
pensed with at once without detriment to the public 
service." 

Mr. Coler shows himself handicapped by his polit- 
ical experience when he urges an increase of the 



284

power of the mayor, and the enlargement of the 
powers of the Board of Estimate, until 
" It became a semi-legislative body. It should have 
power under the charter, by a unanimous vote of all its 
members, to build bridges, sell franchises, open new 
parks, construct public buildings, make and enforce 
through the proper department any regulation neces- 
sary for the public welfare." 

This he seems to propose without regard to the 
functions of the council. Evidently it is necessary 
to insure the responsibility, but the Board of Esti- 
mate is certainly as superfluous as Mr. Coler indi- 
cates are the commissioners. He makes a very 
valuable plea, in discussing practical matters, for 
the amending of the State Constitution to provide 
that the city's bonded indebtedness shall disregard 
investments which permit of pecuniary returns. 
Among the great possibilities of such increased lat- 
itude for municipal activity, would be the develop- 
ment of a great dock system, and the construction 
of tunnels, which, Mr. Goler admirably argues, 
are cheaper and superior to bridges. His chapter 
on the relative cost and value of bridges and tun- 
nels could be studied with profit by the officials of 
every great municipality. In the final chapter on 
political machines, Mr. Coler quite fearlessly attacks 
the " boss." For this the remedy lies in getting the 
people to vote at primary elections. 

" If nominations were made by the people direct 
there would be no bosses, and every corrupt machine 
would be wrecked at the first election. A primary law 
that would enable the people to nominate all candidates 
for office would, I believe, cause all good citizens to 
take some interest in politics." 

His bondage to his old associations is emphasized 
in this chapter, and makes an unhappy anti-climax 
to his many admirable proposals, his final word 
being, " When all the people vote at party primaries, 
when nominations are made by the rank and file of 
Democrats and Republicans, we shall have better 
politics and better government." In spite of this 
limitation of the author's vision, not many political 
officials in American cities could be so little blinded 
by the trees in their view of the forest. 

The last volume issued by the National Munici- 
pal League is an elaboration of the Municipal Pro- 
gram which they have been discussing and complet- 
ing for over a year. It contains chapters of interest 
by well-known students of municipal government, 
and the entire volume is worthy of the attention of 
the citizen. The crucial points are the simplification 
of charters, the passage of amendments to the state 
constitutions when necessary, to secure greater home 
rule for cities, the regulation of municipal fran- 
chises and municipal indebtedness, the simplification 
and unification of public accounting, and finally, as 
touching the most vital problem of democracy in 
cities, the place of the council and of the mayor. 
The charter gives enlarged functions to the council 
in so far as it curtails the numberless elective offi- 
cers to be found in American cities to-day, but it 
also strengthens the hand of the mayor. 



The chief criticism which may be passed upon 
the " Municipal Program " may be found in Pro- 
fessor Eaton's book, " The Government of Munici- 
palities." This is the most thorough and constructive 
book we have had on municipal government. The 
analysis of municipal evils is excellent ; the criti- 
cisms are nearly always pertinent : the flaws of the 
book are incidental to the presentation of a thesis 
which in general will certainly be found to be sus- 
tained by future experience. It is first contended 
that there is no generally accepted standard of mu- 
nicipal government in the United States. There 
was no provision made by our forefathers, because 
there was no general charter adopted similar to the 
Constitution of the States. No doubt one of the 
greatest weaknesses of American government is the 
multiplicity of charters, and the immense number 
of the subjects with which they deal ; and this con- 
fusion causes Professor Eaton to express a satisfac- 
tion with the federal and state constitutions which 
seems not quite warranted. One reason for bad 
municipal government certainly lies in the fact that 
the American people suppose that government may 
assume a permanent form, a fallacy largely due to 
the existing written constitutions. The only func- 
tion of a constitution is to state the most general 
principles, which change slowly. A written con- 
stitution is only a historical document which, by 
good fortune, may have a permanent value. The 
system of checks incorporated into the American 
constitutions is largely responsible for the same 
system in municipal government, and must be 
changed with the simplifying of the latter. If sim- 
plicity is needed in the one, it is needed in the other; 
the same principles apply to central and local gov- 
ernment ; and hence it seems superfluous for Pro- 
fessor Eaton to contend, as he does in the note on 
page 375 : 

" (1) City government deals mainly with business 
and administration, Congress and legislatures mainly 
with political principles and party issues; (2) the latter 
bodies are fit spheres for party action, while the cities 
are not; (3) the difference between the two spheres of 
action is so great as to require that city councils should 
be single chambers, while Congress and legislatures 
should be bicameral bodies." 

Whether his analogies are correct or not, he escapes 
Mr. Color's error and banishes national parties ab- 
solutely from municipal politics. Professor Eaton 
says (pages 24, 25 ) among the causes of bad 
municipal government the following are given : 
(1) Individual selfishness ; (2) confusion of muni- 
cipal and other elections ; (3) (p. 27) centralized 
government and the absence of home rule; (4) 
(p. 40) the limited powers of cities at present; (5) 
(pp. 52, 53) secrecy ; (6) (chap, iii.) national party 
interference. This last is the fundamental evil 
according to Professor Eaton, which he illustrates 
with great force in a thorough criticism of Tam- 
many, carried through three chapters, iv. to vi. 
The next two chapters include a defense of the 
Merit System, and a consequent criticism of spoils.

THE DIAL

Chapter ix. shows the great advantage to be derived 
from free voting and nomination, as illustrated es- 
pecially by British experience. He supports Mr. 
Buckalew in the argument that free nomination and 
voting should be the precursors of proportional 
representation, and might be accepted by reformers 
of varying degrees of radicalism, and his sugges- 
tions are much more valuable than Mr. Coler's re- 
garding the use of primaries. The most original 
portion of the book concerns the functions and rela- 
tions of existing councils and mayors. Professor 
Eaton says of the council (p. 378) : 

" It is the continuous, stable council, representing the 
people and public opinion, and not the mayor repre- 
senting first one party and then another, which by its 
constant policy must uphold the just claims of the city 
against the state and the nation, which must cause the 
city to maintain an enlightened and consistent attitude 
toward its own interests and honor, as well as toward 
the great forces of charity, morality, education, and 
religion." 

The stability of the council is to be maintained by 
only one-third retiring at each election, and by the 
addition of appointed aldermen as in British cities. 
Of the mayor he says : 

" The theory that a mayor may do as he pleases un- 
less his party arraigns him, and that he shall be respon- 
sible to no city authority, but only to the courts, for 
statutory crimes, or to the governor, is repugnant to 
all the analogies and conditions of public safety as it is 
to the fundamental conceptions of republican govern- 
ment. It could hardly find acceptance among an en- 
lightened people whose views of city government had 
not been distorted by habits of thought born of desperate 
municipal conditions and perverted party conceptions. 

" The question whether mayors should be allowed a 
veto power substantially such as belongs to the presi- 
dent and governors is one of importance. In the 
nature of things, there seems to be no good reason why 
mayors, as well as presidents and governors, should not 
have this power. It cannot fairly be said to be a power 
for obstruction. .It is really a power which tends to 
secure careful deliberation and large majorities. 

" Nearly all that has been said in favor of giving the 
mayor the veto power is also applicable in favor of giv- 
ing him a part of the appointing power as well. It 
would certainly increase the dignity of his office and 
make it more inviting to men of large ambition and 
capacity. 

"The experience most favorable to conferring the 
whole appointing power upon the council is mainly that 
of Great Britain. The councils in British, and largely 
in other European, cities make both appointments and 
removals. Apparently, there are no very decisive rea- 
sons, aside from public opinion, why the same method 
would not be equally successful in American cities, after 
good, non-partisan councils have been established." 

Those who desire to examine municipal government 
from the standpoint not of trifling present improve- 
ments, or even fundamental changes in municipal 
machinery which are concerned simply with in- 
creased efficiency, but who look upon the munici- 
pality as the great training school of democracy, 
because more intimately identified with the people's 
interests and nearer to them, can profit by a minute 



examination of Professor Eaton's admirable volume. 
These books all bear witness not only to the 
growth of interest in the municipalities which increase 
so rapidly in size, and whose problems become 
increasingly difficult, but also the growing intelli- 
gence of the municipal students who are sure to 
find the way for the reconstruction of municipal 
government, and who are gradually reaching toward 
the conception that the value of political organiza- 
tion in this country must be judged not only as a 
means of satisfying wants, but by its conformity to 
the standards of democracy.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Mr. Vance Thompson's " French 



. 

book, but we are inclined to think 
that no one tinctured even to a slight degree with 
the love of letters will take it seriously. The au- 
thor himself clearly does not. His book is on the 
Writers of Young France, and he presents to us the 
figures of wonderful leaders of literature, poetry, 
and such things very much as if they really were 
great thinkers or writers. But he does not himself 
think that they are; indeed he candidly says as 
much now and then. He is right : with half a dozen 
exceptions the persons of whom he speaks are not 
persons of consideration ; they are, to use an old- 
fashioned expression, fumistes, a term which may 
be rudely translated " grand-stand performers." Of 
this Mr. Thompson is well aware. What he does 
not seem to be aware of is that the book is not 
representative of French letters to-day. It repre- 
sents a section of what might once have been so- 
called. To present Verlaine and Mallarme', Catulle 
Mendes and Jean Richepin, even Maurice Barres 
and Jean Moreas, as Young France, is a most extra- 
ordinary libel. Shall we call Manet representative 
of Young France ? Or Pissaro ? Or Degas ? The 
fact is that Verlaine is now dead and becoming 
fashionable, Mallarme' is dead and being forgotten, 
Catulle Mendes and Jean Richepin are now over 
fifty, were discredited twenty years ago, and only 
continue to exist in the minds of those who have 
come to maturity since that time, while MM. Barres 
and Moroas are and always were, as Mr. Thompson 
indicates, solemn windbags. Why call attention to 
this matter? Because it seems worth while to say 
that France nowadays has matters more worthy 
attention than those presented in this book. What 
are the ideals presented over and over again by 
Mr. Thompson? In a number of cases we have 
what is practically affectation and need not count. 
But in the other cases we commonly find one of two 
types. One is called by Mr. Thompson " The 
Vagrom Man ": the other is (to use Mr. Thompson's 
euphemism) " the man with red corpuscles." These 
two types are not unknown in America : they are 



286 



[April 16, 



plentifully represented ; the first we call tramps, 
while for the second we have a variety of names 
none of which need be printed. These types we 
know well, hut in life we do not admire them : is 
there any reason why we should be attracted to 
them in literature? There often is reason: Walt 
Whitman, who had something of the tramp dispo- 
sition about him, was also dominated by very large 
and noble ideas ; Byron, who is now again rising to 
influence, although much of a rake, was also pos- 
sessed by large and noble ideas. In these two men 
the ideas sweeten the otherwise unlovely trampish- 
ness or rakishness. Have Mr. Thompson's friends 
these preservative qualities? Take them all in all 
with several exceptions, we should say either they 
have not or he is a bad interpreter. We advise no 
one to bother with any of them but Yerlaine and 
the Belgians. In French literature to-day you may 
find one of the purest and gayest intellects of our 
century, one of the most classic and beautiful poets, 
a number of sincere and sympathetic observers of 
life, and the greatest dramatic romanticist since 
Victor Hugo. We think these are worth crossing 
the frontier to see ; the vagrants and degenerates 
we may study in any of our own large cities, with 
the advantage that our specimens lack the gift of 
speech. 

Now that the New Year has begun to 
road again. revive our old desires and not only 

old desires, but old habits and re- 
membrances and never-attained ideals that for six 
months have lain dormant, now that the snow has 
gone, we are once more fascinated by the great out- 
doors. In the month or so yet, before it will be 
quite nice to spend a day on a country road or a 
river, or to sit out of an evening and see the twi- 
light brighten up with stars, or make a fire on the 
beach and awake from the short summer night to 
see the dawn over the waters, in the month be- 
twixt and between called Spring, one will do well 
to turn to Mr. E. V. Lucas's collection called " The 
Open Road " (Holt), " a garland of good or enkind- 
ling poetry and prose " for city-dwellers, as he says, 
who like to get into the country. It is a very charm- 
ing book from cover to cover, which means name, 
binding, end-papers, and letterpress, as well as the 
collection itself, which is a sort of textbook for the 
logic of the freedom of the soul. It runs many a 
good gamut, from a " Farewell to Winter " to " The 
Reddening Leaf," from "The Windy Hills" to 
" Garden and Orchard," from " Music beneath a 
Bough " to A Handful of Philosophy." It has 
the voice of many a poet from John Milton to 
Matthew Arnold, from Herrick to Stevenson, from 
the well-assured classic to the most late-discovered 
singer of the Bodley Head. We miss one or two 
voices which have often been with us in the open, 
notably those of Mr. Henley on one hand and of 
Thoreau on another : some things are lacking but 
all that there is is good. One thing, however, must 
be noted. The little book is bound in form for the 



pocket, and Mr. Lucas mentions its true function as 
to be read on the road itself, when one is out doors 
in the full summer. Probably Mr. Lucas, like many 
geniuses, does not see clearly the true intent of his 
labors. We are sure that his book is not rightly to 
be read when one is out-doors, but when one is within 
and is looking forward to going out ; not when one 
is actually walking the highway or sitting under the 
tree, but rather when one is not but wishes that one 
were ; in other words not in full summer but just 
now. Now it is to be read, when a roof is still 
comfortable, when a fire is still pleasant, when the 
grass is still brown and the trees still leafless, when 
the pleasures of last summer are still the only ma- 
terial we have for the pleasures of the summer to 
come.

lions from Bion, Moschus, and Bacchylides, done 
in the imaginative and graceful manner of his 
earlier books. Mr. Mifflin is at his best, however, 
in the few sonnets of his own which he includes, 
and his own faith in the mastery of that form is 
shown by his sole use of it here for the rendition of 
many varieties of verse in the original. Conscien- 
tious to the point of quoting one of Shelley's son- 
nets for the sole purpose of disclosing his use of 
half a line, it is impossible to suppose that the trans- 
lator could use Mr. Andrew Lang's prose rendering 
of Bion or Moschus without giving credit ; yet the 
correspondences are many and minute throughout. 
This may be seen in the fragment to Hesperus. 
Mr. Mifflin sings (p. 19) : 

" O Hesper, golden light of eve serene, 

Lamp of the lovely daughter of the foam, 
Thou sacred jewel of the deep blue dome, 
Dimmer as much than Cynthia, silver queen, 

Who sinking slowly, yonder now is seen, 
As thou art brighter than all stars that roam 
The skies ! oh, guide me to the shepherd's home 
The while I lead the revel o'er the green. 

The moon wanes fast ; lend me thy beams divine," etc. 

Italicizing the phrases used in common, Mr. Lang's 
translation reads thus : 

" Hesperus, golden lamp of the lovely daughter of the foam, 
dear Hesperus, sacred jewel of the deep blue night, dimmer as 
much than the moon, as thou art among the stars pre-eminent, 
hail, friend, and as / lead the revel to the shepherd's hut, in 
place of the moonlight, lend me thine," etc. 

These coincidences are hardly less remarkable 
throughout Mr. Mifflin's versions.

variety of sources, a collection of his " Essays in 
Librarianship and Bibliography " ( Francis P. 
Harper). Twenty-five of these fugitive essays are 
now brought within the covers of a single comely 
volume of 343 pages, including index. The Essays 
on Cataloguing and Classification are addressed to 
specialists, but such papers as The Early Italian 
Book Market, Book Hunting in the 17th Century, 
English Paper-Making 18th Century, Preface to 
Blades' " Enemies of Books," and the notes on Sir 
Anthony Panizzi and Henry Stevens, are of more 
general interest. It must come as a surprise to many 
to learn that the paper used in fine books printed in 
England was manufactured on the continent, mainly 
in Italy, down to the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, when its importation was interrupted by the 
war with Spain. The original edition of Middleton's 
" Life of Cicero," Dr. Garnett tells us, was printed 
partly on paper of English make and partly on 
Italian. In the slight memorial sketch of Henry 
Stevens, G.M.B. (Green Mountain Boy), Dr. Gar- 
nett makes a graceful acknowledgment of the 
British Museum's debt to that remarkable Ameri- 
can for the general impetus he gave to the collec- 
tion of the literature on the New World. To 
librarians everywhere, to bibliographers and spe- 
cialists, Dr. Garnett's book is invaluable, while the 
bouklover who once makes its acquaintance would 
not willingly be without it. 

A faMy impartial No history which has yet appeared

War on Spain. States and Spain has shown one-tenth 
of the fairness and impartiality which inheres in " A 
History of the Spanish- American War" (Appleton), 
by Mr. Richard H. Titherington. This does not 
signify that his book is free from prejudice or mis- 
statement by any means, for it is not ; but only that 
he undertook his work with fewer prejudices than 
were the share of the other historians, and has con- 
trived better to maintain the judicial frame of mind 
to the abeyance of his sympathies throughout his 
long and searching narrative. There is a partial 
failure to give the Spanish side of the tragedy which 
overwhelmed the " Maine," and the plain state- 
ment of fact should have been made that no Span- 
ish official has been connected with that calamity by 
any testimony ; it is not made evident that the 
instructions to Commodore Schley concerning his 
remaining off Santiago were left for enforcement 
to his discretion, and that the conduct subsequently 
characterized as " reprehensible " in this regard had 
Admiral Sampson's approval at the time, or that 
the difficulty in coaling off the harbor was due to a 
stormy sea ; but on the other hand there is no at- 
tempt to unduly glorify Admiral Dewey's victory 
by attributing great superiority of force to the 
enemy ; there is no attempt to deprive Schley of 
his just deserts in deeds actually done by him ; there 
is no desire to withhold the facts in respect of 
Aguinaldo's military alliance with the forces of the 
United States ; and the plain contradiction between

his work. _ 

" The Sovereign Ladies of Europe " 
(Lippincott), a showy volume or- 
nately bound and containing 153 
photographic illustrations, may be described as a 
sort of album of European royalty of to-day, for the 
spouses and children of the sixteen " sovereign 
ladies " are included in the pictures. The pictorial 
ensemble, it must be admitted, is not very striking, 
few of the subjects being blessed with even a mod- 
erate share of good looks. The most attractive 
portraits, perhaps, are the earlier ones of Queen 
Victoria, notably the one after Hayter, showing Her 
Majesty as a rather pretty child of eleven gazing 
amiably at a malevolent looking mackaw which to 
the fanciful eye might bear some slight resemblance 
to the intractable Ktuger. The Queen of Italy is a 
distinguished figure ; but the less said about Isabella 
of Spain the better. The portrait of the Emperor 
of Germany (after a Dublin photograph) is the 
most pleasing one we have yet seen not at all like 
the comically and assertively Teutonic ones, with 
the amazing moustachios, upon which Paris carica- 
turists sharpen their wits. " Carmen Sylva " is not, 
in point of personal appearance, all that the admirer 
of her poetry could desire. The prettiest group on 
the list is formed by the three eldest sons of the 
German Emperor fine wholesome little fellows, 
half English, half German, in tennis costume. The 
portraits are accompanied by a series of brief bio- 
graphical sketches, edited by the Countess A. von 
Bothmer, which serve their purpose well and are 
sensibly written. _

but will not give the brightness, the vivacity, and 
the wealth of comment that make up the charm of 
the volume. Of the nineteen chapters a few are as 
follows : " Witty Women and Pretty Women," 
" Old London Coffee-Houses," " Some Famous Old 
Actors," " Queer Clubs of Former Days "; and not 
only these but the others are full of racy anecdote

the dead days live again ; and the court beauties, 
the wits, the politicians and poets of the coffee-

Gwynne, Garrick and Mrs. Siddons, give to the 
pages the color of the life they lived. The book 
gives evidence of thorough research and of the easy 
command of subject and material that research se- 
cures. The mustiness of old records is not here, 
but in its stead the grace of old manners, the joy- 
ousness of living in a time when life was full of the

glow of romance, courtly indolence jostling want, 
beauty and foppishness and polite elegance hobnob- 
bing with debauchery and intrigue. Everyone who 
enjoys English literature may have that enjoyment 
very much enhanced by a reading of the book, so 
full is it of the life out of which literature has 
grown ; and it will have value for all interested in 
English history, for its vivid picture of the life of 
one hundred years age. In mechanical execution 
the book leaves nothing to be desired. 

A scholarly Among Goethe's shorter works none 

edition of a enjoys greater popularity than his 

German masterpiece mie epic Hermann und Doro- 
thea ": nowhere does he betray to a greater extent 
the simplicity born of consummate artistic mastery 
and more knowledge of the humbler phenomena of 
human life. The poem has consequently for many 
years been read by fairly advanced students of Ger- 
man in our colleges. Successfully to edit " Her- 
mann und Dorothea " is a very charming but not an 
altogether easy undertaking. Scholarship must com- 
bine with literary sensitiveness and pedagogic tact 
to make the commentator's work valuable without 
being ponderous, accurate without being pedantic. 
In his new edition of the work, lately issued by the 
Macmillan Co., Professor James Taft Hatfield is at 
his best. The lucid Introduction and the careful 
notes show intimate acquaintance with the work of 
his predecessors in this field and with the contribu- 
tions of Goethe -philology to our knowledge and 
understanding of the idyll. His scholarship and a 
happy gift of expression enable the editor to inter- 
pret or elucidate all passages containing difficulties 
to the student, while his large acquaintance with 
literature in general often gives him an opportunity 
to point to striking parallels in other literatures, 
classical and modern. Special mention should be 
made of the care bestowed on the text proper. By 
supplementing Professor Hewett's labors to restore 
the original text as Goethe wrote it, Professor Hat- 
field was in a position to offer something far more 
satisfactory and accurate than any editor before him. 



A readable 
book on 
Dr. Johnson. 



One of the most interesting of all 
personalities in English literature 
was, and is, Dr. Samuel Johnson. 
Accordingly it is not strange that a society calling 
itself " The Johnson Club " should have been formed 
in London for the sole purpose of keeping green 
the memory of " The Great Cham of Literature." 
Equally natural it is, considering the distinguished 
character of the club membership, that a selection 
from the papers read at their quarterly meetings 
during the sixteen years of the organization should 
now be gathered and published. The " Johnson 
Club Papers " (Scribner's Importation) gives us fif- 
teen papers in all, and among the authors are names 
which ensure good things, Augustine Birrell, 
George Birkbeck Hill, A. W. Hutton, George 
Whale, etc. In these days when not everyone reads 
Boswell's " Life " as certainly as our forefathers 



did, these bright papers will serve a good purpose 
on such subjects as " Some Johnson Characteris- 
tics," Johnson's relations to Music, Politics, Law, 
Travel, etc. Boswell, too, has his^ apotheosis at 
the hands of Dr. George Birkbeck Hill. It is inter- 
esting to know that this indefatigible student found 
a finer collection of Johnsonian and Boswellian 
curiosities in the American city of Buffalo than 
exists anywhere on the other side of the ocean 
that owned by Mr. R. B. Adam. Twenty illustra- 
tions have been well chosen to give the principal 
scenes and persons most closely associated with 
Johnson's life, the whole making a book as hand- 
some as it is readable. 



A pleasant After fairly exhausting the annals of 

addition to Mrs. the countries of Europe during the 

Latimer's histories. century now 8 li pp i ng to i ts c l O8e , 

Mrs. Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer has digressed, 
so to speak, for a moment before adding the crown 
to her work by a seventh volume bringing the story 
down to the very close of the cycle. The result of 
this digression is embodied in " Judea from Cyrus 
to Titus : 537 B. C 70 A. D." (McClurg). With 
charming frankness the historian tells how she was 
led to undertake the work, her attention having 
been attracted to it while translating the fourth and 
fifth volumes of Kenan's " History of the Jewish 
People." " Before I had completed my transla- 
tion," Mrs. Latimer goes on to say, " I had become 
deeply interested in the period of history of which 
it treats, and also was much surprised to find how 
very little I had previously known about it. ... 
It therefore appeared to me probable that that part 
of the public, which I love to designate as ' my own 
readers,' if no better informed than myself, might 
derive pleasure, as I had done, by being more fully 
acquainted with a period that had interested me 
greatly." Such a book, so prepared, and for such 
an audience, leaves nothing to be desired. Mrs. 
Latimer has written in her pleasant and discursive 
manner, following Renan closely but not servilely, 
and omitting questions of criticism and doctrine 
which might have a tendency to take her into deep 
water. Her chance rediscovery of the deutero- 
canonical or apochryphal books of the Bible is 
cause for congratulation.

sons to Californian barber-shops ; was present at

eral wholly unnecessary fatalities among them ; was 
present at the assembling of the first Filipino Con- 
gress under the presidency of Aguinaldo, and bears 
witness to its admirable personnel all the more 
valuable because given grudgingly ; and, in general, 
had a valuable experience which abundantly justi- 
fies his rather large book. Yet Mr. Millet succeeded 
in bringing back most of the prejudices against men 
of another speech and color with which he started, 
making constant correction for the personal equa- 
tion needful. 

The " Reminiscences " of Morris 
Steinert (Putnam), compiled and ar- 
ranged by Mrs. Jane Marlin, tell the 
story of a German with a great fondness for music 
who came to this country in youth, amassed a com- 
fortable fortune after many vicissitudes, and found 
himself able to afford a delightful hobby : the col- 
lection of such musical instruments as can be re- 
garded as forerunners of the piano e forte. Mr. 
Steinert is not unknown through the East for his 
lectures on these earlier instruments, which were 
repeated at the World's Columbian Exposition in 
Chicago ; and his frequent journeys to Europe for 
the purpose of enriching his collection led to his 
delivery there of many lectures which added sub- 
stantially to his reputation. In late years, convinced 
by his bringing a number of old spinets, hammer- 
claviers, harpsichords, and clavichords into a condi- 
tion of musical efficiency that the modern piano 
largely lacks in the way of sweet and sympathetic 
tone, Mr. Steinert has himself invented what he calls 
a " Steinertone," which carries his ideas into prac- 
tice. The story is told in the first person, and is of 
more than ordinary interest. 



constitutional Mr - G - L Lapsey's The County 
history Palatine of Durham " forms Volume 

i* miniature. y m o f the Harvard Historical 

Studies " (Longmans.) Mr. Lapsey says : " During 
the middle ages, and in a restricted sense up to the 
present century, the county of Durham was with- 
drawn from the ordinary administration of the 
kingdom of England and governed by Bishop with 
almost complete local independence. But the com- 
munity of Durham had the same local and economic 
requirements and dangers as the rest of the king- 
dom ; accordingly there developed in the county a 
group of institutions reproducing all the essential 
characters of the central government." These facts, 
in connection with the further one that Durham 
had a much longer independent history than either 
Chester or Lancaster, the other English County Pala- 
tines, give the subject a singular interest, furnishing 
an opportunity to study a section of English con- 
stitutional development under the microscope. " To 
exhibit the growth of these institutions, their organi- 
zation, and their relations to the central govern- 
ment," is the object of Mr. Lapsey's study, which 
becomes, as he says, " the constitutional history of 
an English county." The study, published from 



the income of the Torrey Fund, bears evidence of 
scholarly labor in preparation on every page. More- 
over, it has an enhanced interest to students of 
American history from the fact that the County 
Palatine of Durham was selected by King Charles I. 
as the type of government that Lord Baltimore was 
authorized to establish in his colony of Maryland. 



A satisfactory admirable aim of the "Beacon 

biography of Biographies " (Small, Maynard & 
Thomas Paine. Co ) to f urn ; 8n brief, readable, and 

authentic accounts of the lives of those Americans 
whose personalities have impressed themselves most 
deeply on the character and history of their country, 
is carried out to the full in the volume on Thomas 
Paine, by Mr. Ellery Sedgwick. With an eager sym- 
pathy for justice and liberty, such as Paine himself 
stood for during a long life, the biographer catches 
the spirit of the time and holds it up for us to see the 
spirit of the man in revolt within it. The constant 
desire of the work is to exclude prejudice, and to 
this end the too partial periods of Dr. Conway are 
submitted to the same judicious pruning as the scur- 
rility and slander of Oldys and Cheetham. The 
summing up, after pages full of vivid writing which 
leaves little to be desired in point of clarity and 
picturesqueness, is masterly, showing this revolu- 
tionary hero and true patriot as one of the master 
reformers of the ages.

the Princess of Wales, the Duchess of Teck, Agnes 
Weston, Grace Darling, the Princess Alice, Lady 
Henry Somerset, and Frances Ridley Havergal. 
To the American eye Miss Gary's " hand " shows a 
somewhat over-liberal allowance of court cards ; but 
her heroines, from Queen to light-house keeper's 
daughter, are all " good women " certainly, and 
notable enough to deserve portrayal. The stories 
are simply and sympathetically told, and with a 
pervading strain of pious sentiment that is evidently 
genuine and unforced. Some interesting biographic 
details are given, and the author's occasional lapses 
of style are largely atoned for by her earnestness 
and abounding sincerity. The book is prettily made, 
and the portraits are acceptable. 

In spite of the fact therein recorded, 
that much valuable historical mate- 
rial has been heedlessly scattered and 
lost, the Rev. Arthur Howard Noll has given us an

(James Pott & Co.). The plan of the book includes 
a brief account of the civil story of that common- 
wealth, and the beginnings of the Anglican Church 
there in colonial times. From that it passes slowly 
down to the present, weaving into a detailed account 
of the doings of the Church and its devotees enough

of the annals of the other Christian denominations

history of the State. The book shows the eru- 
dition and scholarship which is to be expected 
from the official historiographer of such a com- 
munion, and is a specimen of book-making much to 
be commended. 

The autobiography Th . e Rev - Joseph Parker, D.D., has 
of a popular written "A Preacher's Life: An 

preacher. Autobiography " (Crowell), which is 

very excellent reading for those who sympathize 
with Dr. Parker's religious views as a matter of 
course, and for all the rest of the world because it 
discloses a powerful individuality and considerable 
talent brought in contact with many of the best 
known English statesmen. Yet the book could not 
be so readable if it were not informed with a sense 
of humor throughout, which explains, one imagines, 
one of the secrets of this most popular preacher's 
success. There is a chapter on " Mad Folks Mainly," 
which is delightful in respect of its anecdotes. The 
" Group of Recollections " near the close of the 
book is also filled with good things to remember. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Dr. Henry Sweet has done many services to the sci- 
ence of linguistics, and the last of them is by no means 
the least. It takes the form of a treatise on " The 
Practical Study of Languages " (Holt), being a guide 
for both the teacher and the taught, although the lat- 
ter, unless he be an exceptionally mature and scholarly 
person, will not find the work as useful as the former. 
What Dr. Sweet gives us is a philosophical study of 
method in the matter of teaching foreign languages, 
ancient and modern, Occidental and Oriental. He 
stands firmly for phonetics as the indispensable foun- 
dation of linguistic study, but otherwise is rather con- 
servative than radical in his recommendations. His 
book is of great value to teachers, and to many other 
persons. 

Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. in London, and Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. in New York, have begun the pub- 
lication of a series of biographies called " The Master 
Musicians," and edited by Mr. Frederick J. Crowest. 
A volume on " Wagner," by Mr. Charles A. Lidgey, is 
the first of the series, and turns out to be a readable 
story, with several illustrations, and the more important 
bibliographical and chronological data in convenient 
tabulation. As criticism, it offers no matter of any 
consequence, but as a popular account of Wagner's life 
and works, is not without merit. 

" Some Account of the Capture of the Ship ' Aurora ' " 
(A. Wessels Co.) is the title selected for the first pub- 
lication of a manuscript left by Philip Freneau, the 
poet of the American Revolution, who was a passenger 
on the ship at the time it fell in with the British frigate 
Iris, The account is picturesque, though it shows no 
sign of the poetical taleut that undoubtedly was the 
author's, and its value is greatly enhanced by the nu- 
merous illustrations, and by the admirable introductory 
memoir prepared by Mr. Jay Milles. The book is 
handsomely printed. 



From the complexity of the Chinese alphabet, instruc- 
tion in reading and writing covers a period of from six 
to twelve years. The Rev. W. H. Murray, principal of 
a school for the blind at Peking, has put into actual 
service the Braille system for teaching the blind to read, 
based on the 408 sounds of the Mandarin Chinese, the 
language spoken by four-fifths of the 300,000,000 in- 
habitants of the Chinese Empire. He found that with 
this system the blind could be taught to read in about 
six weeks. It then followed that illiterate sighted per- 
sons also could be instructed with equal facility, and it 
has become a matter of popular education. The details 
regarding the development of this application of work 
for the blind to the education of the sighted are told 
in a very interesting manner in a book by Miss C. F. 
Gorden-Cumming, recently published in London, enti- 
tled " The Inventor of the Numeral Type for China." 

Miss Isa Bowman, the popular London actress, has 
written, for the special use of young readers, a loving 
and appreciative little sketch of the author of " Alice 
in Wonderland," entitled " The Story of Lewis Car- 
roll" (Dutton). As a child Miss Bowman acted the 
part of " Alice " when a dramatization of the story was 
performed at the Globe Theatre; and she was one of 
Mr. Dodgson's prime favorites one of the " little girl 
friends " whose companionship he loved, and for whose 
amusement he invented the whimsical tales that little 
folks all over the world now read. The booklet is pret- 
tily gotten up and contains some interesting portraits 
and facsimiles. 

"Wagner's Nibelungen Ring Done into English 
Verse " by Mr. Reginald Raukin (Longmans) is not, as 
the title would seem to indicate, a translation of Wag- 
ner's text, but rather a narrative poem in which the 
author has used the dialogue as far as was convenient,, 
but for which he has supplied connective description of 
his own. It is in blank verse, and reads prettily 
enough, although it takes more enthusiasm than is at 
our command to think of Wagner's poem " as an epic 
surpassed only by the ' Odyssey.' " The volume now 
published contains only half of the work as planned, for 
it ends with the parting of Wotan from Briinhilde at 
the close of " Die Walkiire." 

Young readers especially will derive profit and pleas- 
ure from Violet Brooke-Hunt's clearly written and 
carefully compiled historical sketches entitled " Pris- 
oners of the Tower of London " (Dutton), being a 
series of accounts of the more notable captives who, 
from the earliest days down to the period of the Cato 
street attempt, have been confined within the walls 
of the old state prison. The opening chapter tells 
briefly the story of the Tower itself and its builders. 
The author writes simply and directly, and has evi- 
dently taken due pains to prepare herself for the task. 
The volume is plentifully supplied with views and 
portraits.

have just been added by the Messrs. Scribuer to their 
new library edition of Stockton's works. 

The Macmillan Co. now reissue Professor W. H. 
Goodyear's popular book, first written for Chautauqua 
uses, upon " Renaissance and Modern Art." 

" The Messages of Paul " (Scribner), by Dr. George 
Barker Stevens, is the latest volume in the series of 
handbooks entitled " The Messages of the Bible." 

"Doce Cuentos Escogidos," by the best of modern 
Spanish story-tellers, is a recent language text edited 
by Dr. C. Fontaine, and published by W. R. Jenkins. 

Ex-President Cleveland's notable addresses on the 
" Independence of the Executive " at Princeton, April 9 
and 10, will appear in the June and July " Atlantic." 

" A Short History of Monks and Monasteries," by 
Mr. Alfred Wesley Wishart, is announced for early 
publication by Mr. Alfred Brandt, of Trenton, N. J. 

Mr. W. B. Powell and Miss Louise Connolly are the 
joint authors of " A Rational Grammar of the English 
Language," one of the more recent publications of the 
American Book Co. 

" Critical Confessions," by Mr. Neal Brown, is a vol- 
ume published by the Philosopher Press, Wausau, Wis- 
consin. The contents are essays, eight in number, 
mostly upon literary subjects. 

" Lessons in Botany," by Professor George F. Atkin- 
son, and " Outlines of Plant Life," by Professor Charles 
R. Barnes, are two text-books of the modern type re- 
cently published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

Sterne's " Tristram Shandy " and " Sentimental 
-Journey " fill, and worthily, two new volumes in 
Messrs. Macmillan's " Library of English Classics." 
Mr. A. W. Pollard has edited the text for this edition. 

" Michelangelo " and " Rembrandt " are the subjects 
of two small volumes by Miss Estelle M. Kuril 
(Hough ton). Each of them has an introduction, a 
series of fifteen representative works, and a popular 
commentary. 

Mr. Maurice Hewlett's exquisite " Earthwork out of 
Tuscany " (Putnam), has recently been published in a 
new edition with illustrations in photogravure, the work 
of Mr. James Kerr Lawson. It makes, in this form, a 
singularly attractive gift-book. 

Messrs. Hinds & Noble are the publishers of a vol- 
ume entitled " How to Prepare for a Civil Service Ex- 
amination." It is a volume of nearly six hundred 
pages, made up in large measure of sets of examina- 
tion questions and their answers, classified under the 
several departments of the service. 

The Justin Winsor prize of $100, offered by the 
American Historical Association for the encouragement 
of less well-known writers, will be awarded for the 
year 1900 to the best unpublished monographic work 
based upon original investigation in American history 
that shall be submitted to the Committee of Award on 
or before October 1, 1900. In making the award, the 
.committee will take into consideration, not only re- 



search and originality, but also clearness of expression, 
logical arrangement, and literary form. The prize will 
not be awarded unless the work submitted shall be of 
a high degree of excellence. The successful essay will 
be published by the American Historical Association. 

Tomus I. of " Platonis Opera," containing eight dia- 
logues, the text edited by Mr. John Buruet, is a volume 
of the " Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxonien- 
sis," published by Mr. Henry Frowde for the Claren- 
don Press. There is not a word of English in the vol- 
ume, Latin being used for the preface, and, exiguously, 
for the notes. 

" Harper's Guide to Paris and the Exposition of 
1900 " is the first book to reach us of what will prob- 
ably be a numerous collection before the season is over. 
It is a compact volume for the pocket, but it would 
have been still more compact without the entirely un- 
necessary feature of full-page illustrations. Imagine a 
Baedeker padded in that way! 

" The Foundations of English Literature," by Pro- 
fessor Fred Lewis Pattee, is a text-book published by 
Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. It brings the history 
down as far as Milton, and is written from a distinctly 
evolutionary standpoint. It seems to be an excellent 
piece of compilation, and teachers of the subject will 
do well to give it an examination. 

Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. will publish at once twelve 
new volumes in their " Court Memoir Series," thus 
completing the set of twenty volumes, of which eight 
volumes were published last season. The new volumes 
will deal with Marie Antoinette, the Court of St. 
Cloud, Empress Josephine, Catherine II. of Russia, 
the Courts of Sweden and Denmark, and the Court 
of Berlin. 

" Woodworking for Beginners," by Mr. Charles G. 
Wheeler, is a volume of over five hundred pages, in- 
tended to " suggest to amateurs of all ages many things 
which they can profitably make of wood, and to start 
them in the way to work successfully." It is a book 
to be particularly recommended to boys with a taste 
for carpentery. Messrs. Putnam's Sons are the pub- 
lishers. 

A sixth volume in the " Life and Correspondence of 
Rufus King," bringing together the papers dating from 
the last decade of his life (1816-1827), completes the 
task of Dr. Charles R. King in editing the literary re- 
mains of his distinguished grandfather. This volume 
comprises upwards of seven hundred pages, and con- 
tains an index to the entire set. Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons are the publishers. 

" Hand-Camera Work " and " Photography Out- 
doors," two of the earlier issues in " The Photo-Minia- 
ture " magazine, published by Messrs. Tennant & Ward, 
New York, have been so successful as to call for re- 
printing in second editions. They are instructive little 
monographs, compact and well illustrated, which no 
amateur photographer should overlook. 

Superintendent Horace S. Tarbell has had much ex- 
perience in the making of school geographies, and his 
latest book of this sort gets the benefit of them all. It 
is called " The Complete Geography," and bears the 
imprint of the Werner School Book Co. It is modern 
in method and comprehensive in scope, very attractive 
in its illustrations, although less so in its maps the 
latter having the tasteless character common to most 
American geographies. Dr. Martha Tarbell has collabo- 
rated in the production of this book.

TWO BOOKS OF THE HOUR 



THE UNKNOWN 



BY CAMILLE FLAMMARION 

The recent investigations of certain psychical phenomena by eminent Amer- 
ican scientists have aroused such general interest that a mere indication of 
the character of M. Flammarion's book should serve as its best advertisement. 
It is a thoroughly scientific yet popular study of all such phenomena by one 
who for years has devoted much time to the investigation of the subject. 
Dreams, Telepathic Communications, Hallucinations, Premonitions, are all 
discussed and many absolutely authenticated instances are cited. The entire 
work is as interesting as a romance. Crown 8vo. $2.00. 



OUR PRESIDENTS 

AND HOW WE MAKE THEM 



BY COL. A. K. MC CLURE 

Appearing as it does at the opening of the Presidential campaign, Colonel 
McClure's book can scarcely fail to attract wide-spread attention. Its author 
has been in personal touch with every national convention of the past half 
century, and in these reminiscences of the various campaigns he brings to light 
many hitherto unpublished details of famous political controversies, showing 
their bearing upon the careers of the participants. The book also contains a 
detailed account of every ballot taken in the National Conventions of the past 
fifty years. With an introduction by Postmaster General Charles Emory 
Smith. Portraits. Crown 8vo. $2.50.

This book is a sequel to the same author's famous

bicycle tour through Germany are as delightfully 
absurd as they were upon their former expedition 
in search of rest and recreation. It is a book that 
may be read at random and thoroughly enjoyed. 
" Three Men on Wheels " is in every way up to the

The United States Naval Academy 

Being the Yarn of the American Midshipman (Naval 
Cadet), showing his Life in the Old Frigates and Ships-of- 
the-Line, and then at the Naval School at Annapolis ; and 
how that Institution hecame a famous Naval College, mean- 
while making him into the most accomplished and versatile 
young Seaman in the Word ; together with some Reference 
to the Boys best suited for the Navy, and what they must 
do and know to get into the Naval Academy, and what they 
have to expect while there ; and also many Pictures, all 
properly stopped to the Yarn as it is handsomely paid out. 
By PABK BENJAMIN, of the Class of 1867. Fully illus- 
trated. 8vo, $3.50. 

This, the first history of the Naval Academy, written by 
an expert on naval affairs, who is thoroughly competent to 
deal with his subject, must be of interest to every one who 
pays attention to our national system of education. Mr. Ben- 
jamin is a brilliant writer and has treated his subject in a 
sympathetic manner. A valuable feature of the volume is a 
complete list of graduates from the Academy since its incep- 
tion. The work contains views both inside and outside of the 
buildings, as well as portraits of famous graduates, etc. 

Slavery and Four Years of War. 

A Political History of Slavery in the United States, 
together with a Narrative of the Campaigns and Battles of 
the Civil War in which the author took part. By JOSEPH 
WARREN KEIFER, Brevet Major-General of Volunteers, 
ex-Speaker of the House of Representatives, U. S. A., and 
Major-General of Volunteers, Spanish War. 2 vols. Illus- 
trated. 8vo. 

General Keifer's work is not only a history of slavery and 
a philosophical consideration of its bearing upon the Civil 
War, but also an account of his personal experiences ; thus it 
has interest for both the historian and the general reader. 

Modern Italy, 1748-1898. 

By PIETRO ORSI, Professor of History in the R. Liceo 

Forscarini, Venice. No. 59 in the Story of the Nations. 

Fully illustrated. Large 12mo, $1.50 ; half leather, gilt 

top, $1.75. 

Whilst the picturesque heroes of Roman story are familiar 
traditions of our schooldays, Charles Albert, that most noble 
and pathetic of kingly figures, Cavour, and many other Ital- 
ians of modern times are. especially to the younger generation, 
too often mere names. Professor Orsi aims to familiarize his 
readers with the pioneers of modern Italy, and to trace the 
results of their labors in behalf of Italian unity. From his 
academic position the author commands exceptional qualifi- 
cations for such a task.

Song Life of a Sculptor," etc., Lecturer on the Fine 

Arts in Columbian University, Washington, D. C. 

With illustrations by A. B. WENZELL. 16mo. $1.25. 

From an artist we hope for a tale of the fascinating life of 

studios, and Mr. Partridge's book is not a disappointment. In 

this story we have the true artist, who is necessarily first the 

true man, splendidly portrayed. The novel is of absorbing 

interest, and is told with that exquisite charm and beauty of 

style which characterizes all of Mr. Partridge's literary work.

By HORATIO W. DRESSER. 

Living by the Spirit. 

Oblong 24mo (in a slip box), 75 cents. 

The purpose of this little volume is to throw light on the 
problems of daily life. It is a clear, concise statement of 
practical philosophy, based on a study of natural law. Writ- 
ten in a simple style, free from technical and theological dis- 
cussions, and unhampered by bondage to any particular 
school of thought, the book will appeal to that constantly 
increasing class of readers who, dissatisfied with the old the- 
ology and the abstractions of current systems of metaphysics, 
are in search of a theory of life which gives due place to our 
spiritual nature and is at the same time universal.

A WOMAN'S PARIS 

With 40 half-tone illustrations from photographs. Cloth. Size, 7x4 5-8 inches. $1.25. 

" A Woman's Paris " is intended for the use of the American lady who is about to go to Paris, and 
who wishes while she is there, to quote the author's preface, " to do the agreeable things there are to do 
and to avoid the disagreeable things there are not to do." The author is herself an American woman 
who knows her Paris, and who has tried to take up systematically, but readably and entertainingly, the 
questions of living, of servants, of cabs, of churches and theatres, of shopping, of dressmakers, of sports, 
of prices, and a dozen other things, and to point out to her countrywomen just how they may everywhere 
have the best and pleasantest experience possible. The book will be fully illustrated, and will contain,

one finds a concise handbook and a comprehensive ency- 
clopedia combined in a single volume. But Mr. Ireland 
has produced it here. Small as the volume is, it contains 
all that can be required for an adequate understanding

A New Novel of American Life by ROBERT GRANT 

UNLEAVENED BREAD 

In UNLEAVENED BREAD, a phrase in which the character of the heroine is epitomized, Mr. Grant has 
advanced a long step in his literary career. The novel, which is to have its first issue in book form, deals 
boldly and vigorously with the social conditions peculiar to modern life, the career of the heroine being followed 
as she attains to one after another of her ambitions. The three large divisions of the novel indicate the stages 
of this career "The Emancipation," "The Struggle," and "The Success," although, as the reader of the 
novel will note, the " success " which the heroine achieves is to be taken satirically as reflecting the point of 
view of the clever and ambitious woman of the world who has reached her goal. 12mo, $1.50.

" Never will the reader of the biography of Wahb, the Grizzly, forget its quaint 
poetic sadness and humor. It is a gem in its own original way, and we thank and 
praise Mr. Seton- Thompson for an unalloyed pleasure. The story is in the first rank 
of animal narrative, and it has not many companions. May its author be moved 
to give us more of the wild life of forest, mountain, and plane." New York Tribune. 

THE BIOGRAPHY OF A GRIZZLY 

AND 75 DRAWINGS BY ERNEST SETON -THOMPSON, 
Author of "Wild Animals I Have Known," etc. 

Nothing could be less imitative of the ' Jungle Books " than this story by the author of " Wild Animals 
I Have Known," yet in a different way Mr. Thompson is doing for the plains and forests of America very 
much the same thing that Rudyard Kipling has done for the jungles of India. He is, moreover, not 
merely a most sympathetic observer of the ways of animals, but a most accomplished artist, the products 
of whose brush and pencil complement the work of his pen. In Wahb, the Grizzly, he has added a new 
character to fiction, his method of characterization and description being at once realistic and romantic. 
From the monster's vigorous cubhood, through the days of its colossal strength, to the inevitable waning 
that comes with age, we follow the fortunes of the great bear, slayer of men and of bison, till it staggers 
blindly, but not unwillingly, to its doom in Death Gulch " that fearful little valley where everything 
was dead, where the very air was deadly." It must be a hard heart indeed that, having followed the story 
to this point, can read of Wahb's last hours without a sympathetic throb.

A TRUL Y GREA T BOOK 

A MONO the manuscripts which came to us last fall was one entitled 
"^ "Flame, Electricity, and the Camera" (Man's Progress from the First 
Kindling of Fire to the Wireless Telegraph and the Photography of Color), 
by George lies. On the top of the package of sheets was a copy of a letter 
addressed to the author by Prof. John Fiske of Cambridge, who had read 
the manuscript carefully and wrote as follows: 

" I have read your book with an intense interest growing into red-hot enthusiasm. 
It is one of the most fascinating books that I have seen in the last ten years. Your 
points are so well taken, so happily and richly illustrated with examples, and their 
bearing on the main argument is so skilfully kept in view, that the result is to my mind 
a truly great book, and I venture to predict for it a great future." 

The manuscript was turned over to an authority whose judgment 
goes far with us. Here is his report: 

" You may count yourself fortunate in having had submitted to you a book of this 
calibre. You can be sure, also, that no other publisher has ever had an opportunity 
to publish it as in this case you never would have seen the manuscript. Publish it as 
quickly as you can, and in the best style you can; it is worthy of the finest work you can 
put into it, and it will sell for years and years and do you much credit. The book not 
only shows great research and puts forth vital twentieth century facts in a novel and 
impressive way, but the author's style is extraordinarily good. One word more: Follow 
the author's suggestions as to full illustrations he knows what he is talking about." 

The MS. of "Flame, Electricity, and the Camera " was put in hand 
at once; the illustrations, which include plates showing the three-color 
process, half-tones, unusual photographic processes, etc., and many other 
illustrations, have taken long to prepare. The whole work is finished 
and is just out. 

Mr. lies tells simply and so untechnically as to be easily understood 
by any reader what fire, electricity, and the camera have accomplished 
in the work of civilization; he tells clearly and effectively of the latest 
wonders in science. 

The work stands as a most impressive end-of-the-century summing- 
up of the transition from the cave man, eating his food raw, to the man 
of the twentieth century, in whose eyes wireless telegraphy and color 
photography are mere commonplaces; it is, moreover, a profoundly sug- 
gestive contribution to the doctrine of evolution. 

It is a book that should be in every public library in the land, and 
on the shelves of all who are interested in popular science, and we shall 
do our best to put it there. Price, $2.00 net. We are anxious to send 
this book, postpaid, "on approval" to anyone interested.

AN OPINION. 
"I have used Herrick and Damon's 
Rhetoric for almost a year in my classes in 
Freshman Rhetoric, and have found it emi- 
nently satisfactory. It is particularly help- 
ful in its treatment of the sentence and of 
the paragraph, being definite and practical 
rather than theoretical. Unlike many of our 
texts in composition, it practically teaches 
itself, thus giving the instructor extra time 
for correction and criticism." M. Alice

without this work Quarterly Journal of Inebriety.

Every physician should read this volume American Medical Journal. 

It is a contribution of decided value to a much-discussed and but little-analyzed subject by an eminent 
Swedish alienist known to American students of European psychiatry. Medical Standard. 

This is a highly interesting and instructive book. Hypnotism is on the onward march to the front as a scien- 
tific subject for serious thought and investigation. The Medical Free Press. 

To define the real nature of hypnotism is as difficult as to explain the philosophy of toxic or therapeutic ac- 
tion of medicine more so, indeed. None the less, however, does it behoove the practitioner to understand what 
it does, even if he cannot tell just what it is, or how it operates. Dr. Bjornstrom's book aims to give a general 
review of the entire subject. Medical Record.

From Cyrus to Titus, 537 B. C. 70 A. D. 

By Mrs. ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER, author 
of "France in the igth Century," "Spain in the 
igth Century," etc. 8vo, $2.50. 

Mrs. Latimer's wonderful capacity for enlivening historical 
narrative has made her Nineteenth Century Histories popu- 
lar and famous. Her present work on the ancient Jews is 
written in the felicitous, lucid style with which her readers 
are familiar, while it embodies at the same time the most 
exact results of late investigation. 

TALES OF AN OLD CHATEAU. 

By Miss MARGUERITE BOUVET, author of ' ' Sweet 
William," " My Lady," etc. Illustrations by Miss 
HELEN MAITLAND ARMSTRONG. i6mo, $1.25. 

Miss Bouvet's tales for children are unsurpassed in charm, 
delicacy and refinement. These new ones come from France, 
where Grand'maman entertains the little ones with tales of 
by-gone days. The old chateau saw troublous times, in which 
Grand'maman herself figured prominently. 

Miss Armstrong's illustrations, as usual, are exquisite. 

THE .DIVINE PEDIGREE OF MAN. 

By THOMSON JAY HUDSON, LL. D., author of "The 
Law of Psychic Phenomena," "A Scientific Demon- 
stration of the Future Life," etc. i2mo, $1.50. 
" Dr. Hudson aims to show that the facts of organic and 
mental evolution point clearly to a divine origin of mind and 
life on the earth, and that the atheistic theories of agnostic 
evolutionists are destitute erf facts to sustain them." Public 
Opinion. 

" The volume is well worth a careful reading by earnest, 
honest, unprejudiced readers, who desire the truth, no matter 
how far that truth may remove their earlier convictions and 
belief." Toledo Blade. 

THE HOUSE OF THE WIZARD. 

By Miss MARY IMLAY TAYLOR, author of "On the 
Red Staircase," "An Imperial Lover," "A Yankee 
Volunteer." 12 mo, $1.25. 

This is a romance of England in the time of King Henry 
VIII. It displays the same dramatic power and vivid por- 
traiture which have placed the author in the foremost rank 
of historical novelists. In the course of the love story of 
Betty Carew, maid-of-honor to two of Henry's queens, the 
court life of the period is clearly and faithfully portrayed, 
and the manners and superstitions of old England are quaint- 
ly represented. 

THE BEE PEOPLE. 

By MARGARET W. MORLEY, author of "A Song of 
Life," "Life and Love," "The Honey-Makers." 
With many illustrations by the author. i2mo, $1.25. 
"A book brimming over with joyous, healthy interest. It 
was written especially for children. So much cleverness and 
literary excellence entitle Miss Morley to a rank among the 
foremost writers for children." The Beacon, Boston. 
" A charming, instructive book." The Outlook. 



THE DEAR IRISH GIRL. 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of "The Handsome 

Brandons," "Oh, What a Plague is Love!" etc. 

i2mo, $1.50. 

The very title of this work piques a curiosity and interest 
which the perusal of the story is sure to satisfy. A more de- 
lightful story of the educated and refined circles of the Irish 
people it would be hard to imagine, and readers will readily 
concede that the heroine is most appropriately named in the 
title. 

'A book more tender, sweet and wholesome no reader could 
desire." The Speaker, London. 

'This book is written with delicate literary taste." The 
Outlook, New York. 

THOSE DALE GIRLS. 

By FRANCES WESTON CARRUTH. Illus., i2mo, $1.25. 

What would you do if suddenly forced to earn your own 
living ? The Dale girls faced the question bravely, and solved 
it successfully. The account of their trials and ultimate 
triumph makes capital reading. 

"Wholesome, high-principled and inspiring." New York 
Sun. 

"A bright and breezy romance of two brave 'and charming 
American girls." The Beacon, Boston. 

A GENERAL SURVEY OF AMERICAN 
LITERATURE. 

By Miss MARY FISHER, author of "A Group of French 
Critics." Gilt top, deckle edges, i2mo, $1.50. 

A work of fascinating interest to the general reader, and a 
stimulus and inspiration to the student. It is a study of litera- 
ture and literary people, side-lighted by keen and original com- 
ments. Miss Fisher believes that the lives of authors explain 
and illustrate their writings, and she has given us a charming 
and intelligent guide to the best in American letters.

A BOY'S STORY OF THE CIVIL WAR. By BYRON A. 

DUNN, author of "General Nelson's Scout." "The 

Young Kentuckians Series." Illustrated. 12010, 

$1.25. 

This is the second of Mr. Dunn's capital stories of the Civil 
War, describing the further adventures of General Nelson's 
scout. The career of Fred Shackelford, now a captain, his 
hairbreadth escapes and gallant services, will be followed with 
interest not only by the young, for whom the stories are espe- 
cially written, but also by veterans of the war and their fam- 
ilies, and indeed all who would know their country's history. 

MOMENTS WITH ART. 

Short Selections in Prose and Verse for Lovers of Art, 
Collected and arranged by J. E. P. D. i6mo, gilt 
top, deckle edges, uniform with "Musical Mo- 
ments." $1.00. 

Art has inspired many of the choicest gems in literature, 
both in poetry and prose. Into this dainty volume the best of 
these are gathered, and the selection has been made with rare 
taste and discrimination. 

No lover of art and art's masters but will welcome this book 
and be grateful to its compiler.

THE CARDINAL'S MUSKETEER. 

BY M. IMLAY TAYLOR, author of "The House of the 
Wizard," "A Yankee Volunteer," "An Imperial 
Lover," " On the Red Staircase." lamo, $1.25. 
This is a story of a gallant youth whom villainy has robbed 
of his birthright, and who enters the service of Cardinal 
Richelieu. It tells of his love for the aristocratic Renee, and 
his chivalrous wooing, and is one of the most delightful 
romances that Miss Taylor has written. It captivates at once 
and holds the attention throughout. 

"There is love enough to warm and color the adventure, 
but not to cloy the taste; there is dramatic contrast of char- 
acter and situation, swiftness of movement and an easy, 
confident flow of style that combine to make a delightful tale 
one that the reader will lay down with regret that there is 
not more of it." Chicago Chronicle, 

OPPORTUNITY 
And Other Essays and Addresses. 

By the Right Rev. J. L. SPALDING, Bishop of Peoria, 
author of "Thoughts and Theories of Life and 
Education," "Education and the Higher Life," 
" Things of the Mind," " Means and Ends of Edu- 
cation," etc. i2mo, $1.00. 
Bishop Spalding discusses some of the live problems in 

education, ethics, etc., with the same breadth of view and 

force of style which have rendered his previous writings so 

popular and stimulating. 
" Full of noble thought, set forth in singularly genial, 

graceful and eloquent speech." Chicago Tribune. 
"They are statesmanlike in substance, temper and form, 

and they are eminently interesting and practical." The 

Congregationalist, Boston. 

MAN AND HIS DIVINE FATHER. 

By JOHN C. C. CLARKE, D. D. i2mo, $1.50. 

This is the latest treatment of systematic divinity from the 
point of view of the conservative theologian, though the 
author, in reaching his conclusions, has not neglected the 
most recent results of scientific inquiry. The work displays 
a strong grasp of fundamental problems, and will be found 
eminently reliable, scholarly and instructive. 

McLOUQHLIN AND OLD OREGON. 
A Chronicle. 

By EVA EMERY DYE. i2mo, with Frontispiece, $1.50. 
A most graphic and enjoyable history of the movement 
which added to the United States the vast territory of which 
Oregon forms a part. It contains valuable accounts of men 
prominently associated with the history of Oregon; with most 
interesting sketches of the picturesque life of the trappers, 
the missionaries, Indians, pioneers, etc. The author has had 
unusual facilities for the acquisition of new and accurate 
information on the subject. 



HISTORICAL MEMOIRS OF ALEXANDER I. 
And the Court of Russia. 

By Mme. LA COMTESSE DE CHOISEUL-GOUFFIER. 
Translated from the original French by Mary 
Berenice Patterson. With Portraits. i2mo, gilt 
top, deckle edges, $1.50. 

Alexander knew and admired Mme. Choiseul-Gouffier both 
as a woman and as an author, and this volume may with 
justice claim to be the most authoritative life of the Czar. 
It is vivacious, graphic and sympathetic. No more important 
historical translation has appeared in recent years. 

Although the original of this work upon its publication 
sprang into immediate popularity, it has been singularly lost 
sight of for three-quarters of a century, and to-day only two 
copies are known to exist. One is in the British Museum, 
and from the other we are enabled now to offer the first 
translation of the book into the English language. 

THE DREAD AND FEAR OF KINGS. 

By J. BRECKENRIDGE ELLIS. i2mo, $1.25. 

This historical romance will take rank with the most 
famous delineations of ancient life. The period is the reign 
of terror in the time of Tiberius, and the story of love and 
adventure sets before the reader a vivid presentation of 
Roman life under the rule of this vicious autocrat. Many of 
the characters, e. g., Tiberius, Phaedrus, Varro, are historical. 
The movement of the story is swift and varied ; the dialogue 
is bright, and the scenes are alive with deeds of valor 
and love. 

BACK TO CHRIST. 

By WALTER SPENCE. i2mo, $1.00. 

This volume is unique in purpose and plan. It is a clear and 
straightforward statement of the "new theology." It bids 
fair to remove many difficulties from the path of honest 
doubters ; to interest thinking men in the great religious 
questions of the day, and to bring them into closer sympathy 
with Christ and his Church. 

The book appeals especially to that large class of readers 
who would like to see stated with clearness and brevity an 
earnest man's simple and stimulating creed, with the reason 
for its acceptance; for its charm consists of its brevity, 
simplicity and strength. 

THE HONEY-MAKERS. 

By MARGARET W. MORLEY, author of "The Bee 
People," "A Song of Life," "Life and Love," etc. 
lamo, gilt top, illustrated, $1.50. 

" Miss Morley combines the thoroughness, accuracy and 
enthusiasm of a naturalist with the graceful touch of a skilled 
artist. Not only does she reveal with simplicity and care the 
organization and habits of the honey bee, but she indulges in 
felicities of expression that impart an additional charm to her 
story. Miss Morley indicates in the last half of the volume the 
place which the bee and its products have held in literature, 
ancient and modern. This feature is the fruit of extended 
research and displays excellent taste." New York Tribune. 



OH, WHAT A PLAGUE 15 LOVE! 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of "The Dear Irish Girl," "The Handsome Brandons," etc. i2mo, $1.00. 

In Press. 

This story is a delightful comedy of manners, in which a too keen susceptibility to the tender passion on the part of a most 
gallant though somewhat elderly gentleman is a source of constant anxiety to his grown children, who are devotedly attached 
to him. The fun of the situation is developed in Miss Tynan's best vein, and the 
it from the realm of mere burlesque, are applied with her well-known skill.

Miss E. T. Fowler's New Novel. 



A Novel. By ELLEN THORNEYCROFT FOWLER, author of " Concerning Isabel Carnaby," " A Double Thread," 

etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The scene of Miss Fowler's strong and brilliant new novel "The Farringdons" is laid in large part in the " Black 
Country" of England where live the Farringdons, " a hardy race whose time was taken up in the making of iron and the 
saving of souls." A daughter of this house who develops the artistic temperament plays the leading part in the story. 
From her environments, lin which the quaint characters of rustics and workingmen hold a large place, she passes for a 
time to very different scenes in London. The hook is distinguished by the close observation, the humor, and the interest 
in religious and social questions which have helped to gain for Miss Fowler her high place in contemporary fiction. Her 
abundant sympathy with humanity, her understanding of the religious beliefs expressed by her characters, and her skill 
in imparting life and movement to all the figures of a story dealing with the Methodism of the Black country, and also 
with the social life of London, render this picture of life the broadest and strongest work which she has given us.

"The Last Lady of Mulberry" is the title of a fresh and charming novel, whose author, a new writer, Mr. Henry 
Wilton Thomas, has found an unexploited field in the Italian quarter of New York. Mr. Thomas is familiar with Italy 
as well as New York, and the local color of his vivacious pictures gives his story a peculiar zest. As a story pnre and simple 
his novel is distinguished by originality in motive, by a succession of striking and dramatic scenes, and by an understand- 
ing lof the motives of the characters, and a justness and sympathy in their presentation which imparts a constant glow of 
human interest to the tale. The author has a quaint and delightful humor which will be relished by every reader.

Bird students and photographers will find that this book possesses for them a unique interest and value. It contains 
fascinating accounts of the habits of some of our common birds and descriptions of the largest bird colonies existing in 
Eastern North America ; while its author's phenomenal success in photographing birds in Nature not only lends to the 
illustrations the charm of realism, but makes the book a record of surprising achievements with the camera. Several of 
these illustrations have been described by experts as " the most remarkable photographs of wild life we have ever seen."

THE DIAL, 1880-1900. 

With the publication of the present number, 
THE DIAL celebrates its twentieth anniversary. 
We trust that the interest in this fact which is 
felt by editors and publishers will be shared by 
our readers also, and that the present anniver- 
sary issue, departing as to its contents from 
our usual custom, will prove an acceptable sub- 
stitute for what we offer our readers upon 
other occasions. We have thought it permis- 
sible, for once, to pretermit the publication of 
any critical notices of new books, and to pre- 
pare instead a series of articles dealing with 
the developments in literature and those other 
aspects of culture which constitute our prov- 
ince, that have taken place during the twenty 
years of our existence. With the exception 
of the first article, which sketches the more 
salient features of transatlantic literary de- 
velopment during the period in question, the 
contents of this issue deal with American 
subjects, with the various activities concerned 
in the production and distribution of books 
in this country, and with our recent educa- 
tional progress. We trust also that the kind 
words which we have received upon this oc- 
casion from so many quarters, and which it 
gives us so much satisfaction to print, will 
not be without interest to the wide circle of 
our friends. 

THE DIAL is not in the habit of speaking 
about itself, but we may perhaps be indulged 
upon the present occasion to the extent of a 
few words as to the external history of our 
twenty years of publication. THE DIAL was 
founded May 1, 1880, by Mr. Francis F. 
Browne, in connection with the publishing 
house of Jansen, McClurg & Co., bearing the 
imprint of that firm. Under these auspices, it 
made a monthly appearance for a little more 
than twelve years. In the summer of 1892, 
Mr. Browne purchased the periodical from its 
previous owners, and THE DIAL COMPANY was 
organized as a corporation under the Illinois 
statute. Mr. William Morton Payne and Mr. 
Edward Gilpin Johnson, both of whom had 
been frequent contributors to THE DIAL for 
many years, became formally associated with 



328 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



Mr. Browne in the editorship, while Mr. F. G. 
Browne, who had been in charge of the busi- 
ness interests of the paper since 1888, was 
appointed as the business manager. It was 
decided to make THE DIAL a semi-monthly 
publication, with a slight advance in the rate 
of subscription. The first number of the new 
semi-monthly issue was dated September 1, 
1892, and from that date until the present, 
THE DIAL has appeared regularly upon the 
first and the sixteenth day of each month. As 
twelve numbers constitute a volume, the thir- 
teenth volume was made up of the four num- 
bers from May to August, 1892, inclusive, and 
the eight numbers from September 1 to Decem- 
ber 16, inclusive, of that year. Since then the 
volumes have been semi-annual, completed in 
June and December of each year. In conse- 
quence of these facts, THE DIAL is now in its 
twenty-eighth volume, and the present issue 
of the paper is numbered three hundred and 
thirty-three. 

The changes made in 1892 included, besides 
the increased frequency of publication, a con- 
siderable enlargement in the scope of THE 
DIAL, and an increased diversification of its 
contents. Previously, it had confined itself 
somewhat rigidly to the reviewing of new works ; 
it now added such features as the regular lead- 
ing editorial, the occasional essay upon some 
literary or educational subject, the department 
of "Communications" which has proved so 
interesting, and the amplified miscellany. 
These new features added noticeably to its in- 
fluence, and evidence of the satisfaction which 
they occasioned was found in many expressions 
of personal opinion, as well as in the rapidly 
increasing list of subscriptions. THE DIAL has 
had four homes during the twenty years of its 
existence ; its editorial and business offices and 
its composing-rooms are now conveniently and 
commodiously provided for in the Fine Arts 
Building, which shelters under a single roof so 
large a proportion of the literary, educational, 
and cultural interests of Chicago. These are 
the chief circumstances that concern our exter- 
nal history ; we wish particularly to call atten- 
tion to the fact that the editorial conduct and 
the business management of THE DIAL have 
remained practically in the same hands during 
the whole term of our existence, thus making 
possible a continuity of policy and unity of 
purpose not often preserved in the history of 
such a publication, and explaining, in no small 
part, perhaps, tho paper's success. 

The principle? that THE DIAL stands for 



are so well known to its readers that we need 
not reaffirm them here, except in the briefest 
terms. It stands first of all for the signed re- 
view, or in other words, for the responsible 
and authoritative criticism of current litera- 
ture. It stands for the bookseller as a civiliz- 
ing influence, and for the public library as an 
important auxiliary to the work of public edu- 
cation. It stands for the advancement of edu- 
cation subject to the restraints of a wise con- 
servatism, for the humanistic rather than the 
materialistic training. It stands in an attitude 
of perpetual protest toward the vulgarizing 
tendencies of a large part of modern journal- 
ism. It stands for music and the drama as 
indispensable elements of a liberal culture. It 
stands for the endowed theatre and the en- 
dowed newspaper, not as Utopian ideals, but as 
practical possibilities. It stands for an exten- 
sion of the term of copyright, and for the re- 
moval of those vexatious restrictions whereby 
this nation with one hand grants copyright 
to foreigners, and with the other withdraws 
the proffered gift. It stands in unalterable 
opposition to our barbarous tariff upon books, 
works of art, and the instruments of scientific 
research. Although not concerned with the 
narrower issues of politics, THE DIAL is un- 
willing to remain silent when questions arise 
which touch the very principles upon which 
our civilization is based, and in such cases its 
voice will continue to be raised, as it has been 
raised more than once during the .past few 
years, in behalf of those national ideals and 
international amenities which we cannot ne- 
glect without forfeiting the most precious part 
of our American birthright. 

Entering now upon our second score of 
years, we hope to keep THE DIAL all it has 
been in the past, and to add to its usefulness in 
the future. If public appreciation of our efforts 
to maintain a high standard of literary criti- 
cism, and to advocate the cause of the higher 
culture in this country, shall continue to in- 
crease as it has been increasing since the scope 
of this journal was broadened eight years ago, 
we shall be deeply gratified. We already owe 
much to our friends, but will be glad to ac- 
knowledge a still greater debt. And we 
promise the public whose favor has made our 
existence possible, and has added to our fol- 
lowing from year to year, that we will continue 
to represent, to the best of our endeavor, and 
as far as our resources shall make it possible, 
all those intellectual interests with which we 
have so long been identified.

TRANS A TL ANTIC LITERATURE. 

Although the chief purpose of this anniver- 
sary issue of THE DIAL is to consider the 
changes that have been wrought during the 
past twenty years in American literature, and 
in the conditions which affect those other de- 
partments of cultural activity with which the 
paper's work is allied, yet we must not miss the 
opportunity now presented of making some 
sort of brief survey of the recent course of lit- 
erary history in England and on the Continent 
of Europe. When we get far enough away 
from any literary period to view it in the 
proper perspective, twenty years does not seem 
a very long time. That term of years taken 
almost anywhere in a past century might, ex- 
cept for the purposes of intensive study, be 
summarized in a few words. But when the 
twenty years in question are those that lie just 
back of the immediate present, the case is dif- 
ferent, and the task far more difficult. We 
have so many recollections and personal asso- 
ciations with the books and writers of the 
period in which we have lived that it is not 
easy to single out the things that call for 
special mention. We cannot see the woods 
for the trees. We are tempted to magnify 
unimportant happenings, and to attach undue 
importance to names that may be clean forgot- 
ten a generation hence. But, making the full- 
est allowance for such illusions as arise from 
our intimate connection with the years in ques- 
tion, we cannot help thinking that the his- 
torian of the far distant future will see in the 
closing decades of the nineteenth century a 
period more noticeable than others of equal 
length for the rapidity of its literary develop- 
ment and the pronounced character of the 
changes which it has witnessed. One of its 
most marked characteristics will be seen to 
have been the great losses which it has sus- 
tained in the death of its most forceful writers, 
without any corresponding compensation in the 
appearance of others capable of filling the va- 
cant places. How true this is of American 
literature will be seen from the special article 
upon that subject which is to follow. That it 
is equally true of English literature, using the 
term in its narrow sense, will appear evident 
upon a moment's reflection. In the case of 
both branches of literature in the English 
language, the losses of the last twenty years 



have been so many and so great, the new 
writers of real force so few and far between, 
that we may well ask the question: Whom 
have we left to present to the century upon the 
threshold of which we are now standing? 
Cleverness and technical mastery are indeed 
offered us in many forms by our newer writers ; 
the cleverness is almost preternatural at times, 
and the technique would put many of the older 
masters to blush. But the soul of literature 
does not live by these qualities alone, and, 
whatever momentary admiration they may 
arouse, they are not ultimately satisfactory. 
Nothing but genius gives lasting satisfaction, 
and to that we freely pardon those minor de- 
fects upon which pedagogues are wont to 
frown. Genius, however, is coming every year 
to be a rarer commodity in English literature, 
and the deficiency appears startling when we 
contrast the conditions of to-day with those of 
the sixties and the seventies. 

With the Continental literatures the outlook 
is not quite so dark. The latter part of the 
century has been marked by a strong resurg- 
ence of national feeling among nearly all of 
the distinctive peoples of Europe. Magyars 
and Czechs are no longer content to be merged 
in the political conglomerate of Austria. Finns 
and Poles resent with increasing vehemence 
their subjection to Russian influences. Even 
the Norwegians chafe under the enforced union 
with their Swedish kinsmen, and assert their 
own separate nationality in every possible way. 
Thirty years of imperial Germany have really 
accomplished much for that unity of feeling 
which was only a dream of the future when 
the King of Prussia assumed the title of Ger- 
man Emperor in the palace at Versailles. 
Even France, throughout all modern history 
more unanimous and self-centred than the 
other nations of the Continent, has achieved 
a greater solidarity than ever before under the 
regime of the Republic. The Mediterranean 
countries, also, have shared in this renewal of 
national feeling, of which evidence may be 
adduced from the recent history of Greece, 
Italy, and Spain alike. This fortification of 
race sentiment, which has played havoc with 
so many political ambitions, has proved highly 
stimulating to literary activity. 

Let us enumerate a few of the developments 
of Continental literature during the past twen- 
ty years, indicating at the same time some of 
the losses that have been sustained. Taking 
first the outlying countries, as distinguished 
from France and Germany, which represent 



330 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



the core of present-day Continental culture^ 
the following are among the more conspicuous 
facts to claim our attention. There has arisen 
in Spain a distinctively modern school of fic- 
tion, which has justly challenged the admira- 
tion of the reading world. It is true that 
Alarcon and Senor Galdos occupied the field 
for some years before the period with which 
we are dealing, but even Senor Galdos, in his 
later manner, is a very different person from 
the author of his earlier series of books con- 
cerned with the romance of Spanish history, 
and, taken in connection with Senores Valera 
and Valdes, with Senora Bazan, and with the 
dramatist, Senor Echegaray, he marks a tran- 
sition in the spirit of Spanish literature which 
affords the plainest evidence that contempo- 
rary Spanish thought is no longer bound to 
the traditions of the past, but takes an active 
interest in all the problems of the modern 
world. In Italy, the modern movement, al- 
though it offers the unhealthful phase illus- 
trated by the work of Signor d'Annunzio, of- 
fers also the sane developments represented 
by Signor de Amicis, Signor Fogazzaro, and 
Signor Verga. Signor Carducci remains what 
he has been for the last thirty or forty years, 
the one great Italian poet of our time, great, 
that is, in a sense that provokes comparison 
with the best that any literature has to give us. 
In Hungary, Mr. Jokai, full of years and 
honors, is the one writer who is generally 
known to readers everywhere; none of the 
younger men have thus far attracted much at- 
tention outside of their own country. Belgium 
is so closely affiliated with France that its 
writers do not appeal to us especially as Bel- 
gians, but to this statement there is the one 
noteworthy exception of M. Maeterlinck, whose 
work has had much vogue of recent years, and 
is particularly interesting on account of the 
way in which it illustrates some of the more 
exaggerated tendencies of what is called sym- 
bolism. M. Maeterlinck writes in the French 
language; the only living writer of Flemish 
generally known to English readers is the 
Dutch novelist, Heer Couperus, whose prob- 
lem fictions have had a deserved success out- 
side of Holland. That charming Dutch nov- 
elist who chooses to write under the name of 
" Maarten Maartens " has made himself prac- 
tically an English novelist by writing his books 
in our own language. It is within very recent 
years, that is, within the last decade, that the 
astonishing novels of Mr. Sienkiewicz have 
come to be known throughout the world, and 



have restored Poland to the literary map of 
Europe, although the political map has no 
place for it. It would hardly be an exaggera- 
tion to describe this writer as the most re- 
markable genius who has appeared in Conti- 
nental literature during the period which we 
are now reviewing. In his work the conscious- 
ness of a noble race becomes intimately re- 
vealed to us more intimately, in fact, than 
in the poems of Mickiewicz, or even in the 
music of Chopin and the great part played 
by Poland in the history of Europe is made 
known to us. When we turn to Kussia, our 
first thought is of the fact that Tourguenieff 
was living and writing twenty years ago, and 
of the irreparable loss to literature when he 
died in 1883. Since then the one great name 
in Russian literature has been that of Count 
Tolstoy, but even of him, writing from a liter- 
ary rather than from a sociological point of 
view, one is compelled to say, stat magni 
nominis umbra, for " Anna Karenina " was 
published in 1877, and since then the author's 
footsteps have been straying erratically about 
in the morass of didacticism. In the Scandi- 
navian countries, the most important happen- 
ing of the last twenty years has been the im- 
mense widening of the bounds of Dr. Ibsen's 
reputation. Although for thirty years he had 
been producing play after play, including 
those great works upon which his fame will 
chiefly rest when the final account is taken, 
his name was practically unknown in 1880, 
except in Germany, outside of the Scandina- 
vian kingdoms. It was in 1879 that Mr. 
Gosse, in his " Studies in the Literature of 
Northern Europe," first called the attention of 
English readers to the writer who has since 
become so widely read. Until well along in 
the eighties we never heard the name of Dr. 
Ibsen mentioned in this country, either in con- 
versation or in print. Herr Bjornson had for 
many years been known to our public as the 
author of certain idyllic tales of Norwegian 
peasant life, although even he was entirely 
unknown as dramatist or as lyric poet. The 
great widening of Dr. Ibsen's reputation coin- 
cided rather closely with the great change in 
method and subject-matter which came over 
his work about twenty years ago. In 1880 
" The Pillars of Society " was three years old, 
and " A Doll Home " had been published only 
the year before. It is upon these two plays, 
and their ten successors, all dealing with the 
problems of modern society, that the author's 
reputation is even now chiefly based, a caprice 



1900.] 



THE DIAL

of popular judgment which completely ignores 
his real masterpieces. The same caprice of 
popular judgment, which we do not believe 
that time will justify, makes of him at present 
a more conspicuous figure than his great Nor- 
wegian contemporary. But, however these 
critical values may be readjusted by the com- 
ing generation, there is no doubt that for the 
present generation Dr. Ibsen represents one of 
the strongest influences now operating in lit- 
erature. In Danish literature, the most im- 
portant name of the last twenty years has been 
that of Dr. Georg Brandes, which fact is par- 
ticularly interesting as a revindication of the 
claims of criticism to consideration as one of 
the branches of literature proper. It is a 
somewhat noteworthy fact that in one country, 
at least, a literary critic should remain for a 
long term of years its foremost man of letters. 
German literature in 1880 had no poets 
worth speaking of, unless we mention a few such 
writers as Geibel, Bodenstedt, Fontane, and 
the author of " Der Trompeter von Sakkin- 
gen." It had, however, an important group of 
novelists in Auerbach and Freytag, Herr 
Spielhagen and Herr Heyse. To-day, as in 
1880, we still think of Heine as the last of the 
great German poets, although a few, perhaps, 
may claim for the author of " Die Versunkene 
Glocke" the poetic laurel. Although Herr 
Spielhagen and Herr Heyse are still living and 
writing, their pristine fires are now little more 
than embers, and there can be no doubt that 
Herr Hauptmann now occupies the most con- 
spicuous place in German letters. For some 
years the race was close between him and Herr 
Sudermann, but at present he seems to have 
outdistanced his only serious competitor. The 
prominence of these two writers, who are dis- 
tinctly the most serious representatives of the 
Young Germany of letters, is important not 
only because of the intrinsic value of their 
writing, which is considerable, but also because 
they have given a new impulse to that form of 
the drama which is both biihnenmdssig and lit- 
erary. This modern rehabilitation of the acting 
drama as a form of literary art has been going 
on in several countries, but in no other, not 
even in France, as noticably as in Germany. 
The respect with which the playhouse and its 
associations are treated in that country repre- 
sents one of the most important things that 
Germany is now doing for literature. But in 
spite of all that we may say in behalf of recent 
German literature, the fact must be recognized 
that the Empire has not, in the thirty years of 



its existence, accomplished as much as might 
reasonably have been expected. The output 
has been enormous, but mediocrity has charac- 
terized the greater part of it. It is only now 
and then that a poem or a book, a play or a 
critical monograph, has risen above that dead 
level ; very little of the German literature pro- 
duced during the past twenty years has won for 
itself that wide cosmopolitan hearing for which 
no really important work, in our age of alert 
publishing and quickly diffused intelligence, 
has long to wait. Before closing this para- 
graph, we should say a word about the influ- 
ence exerted by the writings of Herr Nietzsche. 
That influence has been unwholesome and de- 
moralizing, but it must be reckoned with in 
any attempt to trace the main currents of con- 
temporary thought. 

The French literature of the past twenty 
years resembles our own in the balance of its 
gains and losses, the former having been by no 
means commensurate with the latter. The 
greatest French writer of the century has died 
within the period under consideration, and, 
such was his vitality, and such the astonishing 
fertility of his genius, that even his octogena- 
rian years did not preclude him, up to the very 
last, from continuing to enrich the treasure 
house of French song. The death of Leconte 
de Lisle, although far less significant than 
that of Hugo, was still a heavy loss to French 
poetry, and there are many persons to whom the 
wayward and poignant note struck from the 
lyre of Paul Verlaine came with a fresh charm 
that makes them sincere mourners of his death. 
Next to Victor Hugo, the greatest loss of 
French literature during the period under con- 
sideration was felt when Kenan passed away in 
1892, within a few days of the death of the 
greatest of our English poets. The death of 
Taine, soon thereafter, was also an event of 
more than common significance. Taine and 
Kenan, however, had lived their lives and done 
their work. But it was the promise, even more 
than the achievement, of James Darmesteter 
that lent a peculiar touch of sadness to his pre- 
mature taking-off. French literature has also 
lost the younger Dumas, Augier, Labiche, 
Feuillet, Daudet, Maupassant, and Cherbuliez. 
Flaubert died in 1880, at the very beginning of 
the period now under discussion. It is obvious 
that no such men are now left to French litera- 
ture as those that have been taken away. To- 
set off against the name of Hugo we have the 
names of MM. Sully-Prudhomme and Coppee. 
Against the names of the older dramatists we

[May 1, 



have those of MM. Sardou and Rostand. To 
take the place of the lost novelists we have M. 
Zola, whose present notoriety will not avail to 
save his literary reputation, M. "Loti," M. 
Bourget, M. Rod, and a host of other excellent 
second-rate men. We have also, indeed, M. 
Anatole France, that well-nigh impecable pros- 
ateur, but even his name cannot go far toward 
restoring the lost balance. The French litera- 
ture of the past twenty years has been as pro- 
lific as ever, as far as the main departments of 
belles-lettres are concerned, but very few works 
in any of these departments command our at- 
tention by their preeminent excellence. There 
has been a noteworthy movement in poetry, in 
the direction of what is vaguely known as 
" symbolism," much discussed by those who af- 
fect the cult, but not to be considered very se- 
riously by those who are concerned for the 
higher interests of French literature. The 
movement seems to be characterized by an 
impatience of all artistic restraint, a revolt 
against the chief canons of poetical form, a 
somewhat sickly cast of thought, and a tend- 
ency to exalt little men to the rank of great 
masters. This tendency is, of course, exhibited 
chiefly within the limits of its own clique of 
mutual admirers, and is not characteristic of 
sober criticism, as represented by such men as 
MM. Brunetiere and Faguet. In other words, 
there is in the France of to-day, as in every 
other country of Europe, a group of jeunes, 
who are trying all sorts of unregulated experi- 
ments in verse and prose, who are making a 
great pother about their doings, and who are 
minutely subdivided into little parties and 
sects, united only in their common endeavor to 
accomplish great things with small intellectual 
means. Far more creditable to the contempor- 
ary French spirit is that other and broader 
movement of thought which has been seeking, 
ever since the nadir of imperialism was reached 
thirty years ago, to regenerate the moral ideals 
of the French people, and to restore the atmos- 
phere of earnestness which seemed to have been 
lost. How nobly Kenan and Taine labored to 
this end is matter of familiar knowledge. Their 
efforts have born fruit in the writings of Dar- 
mesteter and Guyau, of MM. Brunetiere, La- 
visse, Wagner, and Rod, and of the Vicomte de 
Vogue. If this movement has in some cases 
tended toward a reactionary neo-Catholicism, 
its net outcome has been for good, and its in- 
fluence upon the younger generation must have 
been great, if not at the present time exactly 
calculable. 



Turning now to English literature our 
own literature upon the other side of the ocean 
the capital fact confronts us that in 1880 
there were six great English poets among the 
living, and that in 1900 there remains but one. 
During the twenty years Tennyson and Brown- 
ing, Rossetti and Morris and Arnold, have all 
passed away, leaving Mr. Swinburne in ex- 
alted isolation, the only great poet of the nine- 
teenth century whom we may hope will live to 
carry on into the twentieth its glorious liter- 
ary tradition. Our age of gold has to all seem- 
ing reached an end, and Mr. Stedman, who a 
quarter of a century ago recognized in the 
years of the Victorian reign a distinct literary 
period, which even then showed signs of draw- 
ing to a close, must himself be a little surprised 
at the completeness with which his prediction 
has been borne out by the event. In the place 
of our major poets we have now only minor 
ones, and the fact that we have them in larger 
numbers than ever before offers us no consola- 
tion for the loss of the great departed. Aside 
from Mr. Swinburne, we are compelled to 
point, when questioned concerning our living 
poets, to Mr. Aubrey DeVere, Mr. George 
Meredith, Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, Mr. 
Robert Bridges, Mr. William Watson, Mr. 
Stephen Phillips, Mr. W. B. Yeats, and Mr. 
Rudyard Kipling. We hold these men in es- 
teem, it is true, but however we may admire 
the delicate art of Mr. Bridges, for example, 
or the resonant virility of Mr. Kipling, our 
sense of proportion does not permit us to set 
these men upon anything like the plane occu- 
pied by the great poets who have died since 
1880. And, with but few exceptions, our 
living poets seem to be no more than " little 
sonnet-men," 

" Who fashion, in a shrewd, mechanic way, 
Songs without souls that flicker for a day, 
To vanish in irrevocable night." 

Prose fiction of some sort or other we have al- 
ways with us, and the names of Mr. Meredith 
and Mr. Hardy would lend distinction to any 
period, but the great age of the Victorian nov- 
elists ended with the death of " George Eliot " 
in 1881. Although frequently compared with 
that woman of genius, Mrs. Ward may hardly 
be said to fill her place. Since her death we have 
also lost Lord Beaconsfield, Trollope, Black, 
Blackmore, and Stevenson. When we turn to 
the great writers of prose, the contrast between 
the living and the dead is seen to be almost as 
pronounced as in the case of the poets. Within 
twenty years, Carlyle and Ruskin, by far the

THE DIAL 



greatest prosateurs of our time, have ceased to 
appeal to us with the living voice. The per- 
suasive eloquence of Newman and Martineau 
has been hushed, and the plea for culture, 
voiced in such dulcet terms by Arnold and 
Pater, is no longer heard. All these men are 
now among 

" The dead, but sceptred sovereigns, who still rule 
Our spirits from their urns," 

but to whose counsel we may no longer turn 
when new questions arise and call for new so- 
lutions. Of the four great men of science who 
have caught the ear of the general public dur- 
ing the past twenty years, and whose teachings 
have wrought so complete a change in the at- 
titude of all thinking men toward the claims 
of scientific culture, and the place of science in 
education, Mr. Herbert Spencer alone remains 
to us. Darwin, Huxley, and Tyndall have 
died, but happily they lived long enough to 
witness the general acceptance of the ideas for 
which they fought so good a fight, and to be 
assured that the evolutionary principle had 
won for itself the suffrages of all whose judg- 
ment was worth having. The older school of 
historical writing, as represented by Green and 
Froude, has given place to the school repre- 
sented by Dr. Gardiner and the Bishop of Ox- 
ford. The scholarship of these men is no doubt 
deeper and more accurate than was that of 
their predecessors, but their "literature" is 
sadly to seek, and their influence consequently 
restricted. The general reader, with a taste 
for this sort of writing, does not turn to the 
" Select Charters," but rather takes down from 
the shelf his well-worn " Short History of the 
English People," and is not particularly con- 
cerned with the fact that later research has in- 
validated some of its positions. The two most 
conspicuous cases of personal success achieved 
in English authorship during the past twenty 
years have been those of Stevenson and Mr. 
Kipling. Both afford striking illustrations of 
the "craze" in literature. A few years ago 
we were told by many enthusiastic readers that 
in Stevenson the great masters of our fiction 
had found a worthy successor. More recently 
we have been assured that Mr. Kipling is a 
great poet, and the ill-considered laudations of 
his admirers have been dinned into our ears. 
Such outbursts of uncritical applause always 
make the judicious grieve, but their effect soon 
wears away, and the men who occasion them 
come to be viewed in the proper perspective. 
Stevenson has already taken his place as an 
entertaining novelist of the second or third 



class, and his singularly lovable personality is 
not now mistaken for literary genius by any 
great number of persons. Mr. Kipling, like- 
wise, is fast coming to be viewed as a member 
of the considerable company of the minor poets 
of to-day, and his essential message, the more 
closely we examine it, is found to make much 
of its appeal to the more vulgar tastes and the 
baser instincts of human nature. Mr. Stephen 
Phillips is the latest of the "new poets " who are 
discovered and exploited now and then by En- 
glish critics, and there is no reason thus far 
apparent why his case should not parallel that 
of all the others. He has, no doubt, an excep- 
tional gift of refined poetic expression, but 
there is no distinctively new note in his song ; 
there is merely a new blending of the notes 
which are already familiar to us. To illustrate 
what is really meant by a new note in English 
song we must go back to Rossetti's " Poems " 
of 1870, or to 1866 and the first volume of 
Mr. Swinburne's " Poems and Ballads." The 
past two decades have witnessed no such event 
in English literature as was marked by the ap- 
pearance of eithei of the volumes just men- 
tioned. When we contrast the period of the 
sixties and seventies with the period of the 
eighties and nineties we may realize all the 
difference between a period in which the cre- 
ative imagination is at full tide, and a period 
in which the flood of genius is fast ebbing 
away. In the later of the two periods English 
literature has rounded out the great work of 
the earlier ; as the great writers have died, 
only lesser ones have appeared to take their 
places ; and many of the younger men, recog- 
nizing the futility of any attempt to carry on 
the old tradition upon its old lines, have be- 
come mere experimenters in new moods and 
forms, hoping to hit upon some promising line 
of new literary endeavor, but not as yet indi- 
cating with any precision the direction which 
will be taken by the movement of the coming 
century. This restlessness, this confusion of 
ideals, and this uncertainty of aim are the un- 
mistakable marks of a transition period in lit- 
erature. A remarkable age has rounded to 
its close, and it is impossible to determine with 
any assurance whether the age to come will be 
merely critical and sterile, or whether it will 
give birth to some new creative impulse. 

What has just been said of the last years of 
our English literature is generally true of lit- 
erature throughout the world. Its activities 
are everywhere largely experimental ; most of 
the younger writers in all countries appear to 



334 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



be convinced that their only hope of making a 
mark lies in the discovery of new methods and 
new forms. We seem to be living in an age 
of literary anarchy, in which every sort of ex- 
cess or extravagance claims a hearing. There 
are schools and sects and cliques everywhere, 
but there are no controlling principles. This 
aggressive and unregulated individualism even 
seeks to bend criticism to its heterogeneous 
aims by denying the very principle of critical 
authority. It pretends that the belief in crit- 
ical canons is a superstition, and that individ- 
ual liking is the only test of good literature. 
Impressionism in criticism is so far in the as- 
cendant that many people no longer find intel- 
ligible the point of view from which a critic 
can say of a composition that he likes it per- 
sonally, but that it is nevertheless bad liter- 
ature. Yet this is the point of view that every 
critic must at times be prepared to take, if he 
have any regard for the seriousness of his call- 
ing. Few critics have ever so succeeded in 
eliminating the personal equation from their 
make-up as to bring about an absolute align- 
ment between their subjective impressions and 
their objective judgments. In the presence of 
all the diversity of purpose exhibited in the 
literary activity of recent years, and of all the 
diversity of critical opinion with which it has 
been greeted, the search for any principle of 
unity becomes well-nigh hopeless. There is, 
however, one fairly comprehensive statement 
which may be made, and upon which we are 
justified in placing considerable emphasis. The 
European literature of the last twenty years 
has been more distinctly sociological in char- 
acter than the literature of any preceding 
period. The social consciousness has been 
aroused as never before, and the complex rela- 
tions of men and women, both to each other 
and to society in the aggregate, have supplied 
themes for a constantly increasing number of 
novels and poems and plays. A large propor- 
tion of the writers who have been named in the 
foregoing pages illustrate some phase of this 
new or at least heightened sense of the duties 
of human beings toward one another. It was 
more than accidental, it was rather in obedience 
to an irresistible tendency of human thought, 
that such men as Buskin, Count Tolstoy, Herr 
Bjbrnson, and Dr. Ibsen turned at about the 
same time, and with a common motive, from 
the past to the present, from the romantic to 
the real, from work in which the testhetical 
element was predominant to work in which the 
ethical element was set, sometimes far too ob- 



trusively, in the foreground. This movement 
resulted in a manifest loss to art, but it has 
accomplished much for the betterment of man- 
kind. The change of aim and method which 
in these writers marks so sharp a contrast be- 
tween their earlier and their later work is par- 
alleled in many other writers of less import- 
ance. And many of the younger men, following 
the biological law which makes the develop- 
ment of the individual to a certain extent an 
epitome of the development of the race, have 
started upon their career as idealists, only to 
succumb, after a few preliminary flights, to 
the tendency which has done so much to make 
of modern literature the handmaid of social 
analysis and ethical reform. The interests of 
pure literature have suffered in this transform- 
ing process, but life is even more important 
than literature, and it is possible that the final 
reckoning will show the gains to have balanced 
the losses. At all events, this introduction of 
an avowed social and ethical purpose into 
nearly all sorts of writing is the most charac- 
teristic thing that the last twenty years have 
done for the literature of the world.

AMERICAN LITERATURE. 



During the twenty years of its existence 
THE DIAL must have reviewed nearly twice 
twenty thousand books, and of these quite a 
large proportion must have been produced in 
America. How is such a mass of literature to 
be sifted and weighed ? And how is one who 
has grown to manhood during the period, who 
has formed friendships with contemporary 
writers and been influenced by contemporary 
books, to judge impartially of the value of a 
literature that is still evolving, or to describe 
its tendencies or fix its limitations ? 

I cannot answer my own questions, for books 
and writers appear to compass me so thickly 
about that when I think of recent American 
literature I seem to be in a forest the range of 
which I cannot estimate because I can see 
nothing but trees. Yet whatever may be the 
propriety of any contemporary's dealing with 
so broad and complex a subject as American 
Literature since 1880, it can scarcely be 
doubted that it is eminently proper for THE 
DIAL to celebrate its twentieth anniversary by 
publishing a resume of the achievements of 
American authors during a period in which

THE DIAL 



335 



the journal itself has been a source of inspira- 
tion to all who care for good literature. Per- 
haps in THE DIAL'S necessity I may find my 
opportunity for seeking and obtaining pardon 
for the rashness of which I am about to be 
guilty. 

It may seem to be a bad omen to begin with 
a necrology ; but the necrology of a period of 
literature is often instructive. More veteran 
authors lived into and died within the last 
two decades of our literary history than was 
the case, seemingly, with any two previous 
decades. Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, 
Lowell, Holmes, Whitman, Bancroft, Park- 
man, Curtis, Mrs. Stowe all these eminent 
writers, who had won their fame years before, 
passed away within our period and exerted a 
powerful influence upon it, not merely by their 
writings but by their presence in the flesh. 
Many contemporary writers doubtless feel as 
though they grew up among giants, and while 
some have been incited to emulation, others 
have perhaps suffered discouragement, and 
still others have been tempted to win fame by 
a revolt from established literary traditions. 
It is at least clear that certain outre tendencies 
among our younger writers date from years 
when scarcely a veteran- author of the first rank 
was left alive. 

Some other names in our necrology will 
serve to show how very different from its pre- 
decessors is the epoch we are studying. Lydia 
Maria Child and Jones Very died in 1880 ; 
yet how far away do we who applaud Admiral 
Dewey and read " David Harum " seem to be 
from the days of the Abolitionists and the 
Transcendentalists ! And yet Christopher 
Pearse Cranch, who wrote in Emerson's 
"Dial " along with Margaret Fuller and other 
by-gone worthies, lived until 1892, the year in 
which Mr. Rhodes published the first volumes 
of his History of the United States from the 
Compromise of 1850. The long life of Judge 
Gayarre, the historian of Louisiana, who died 
in 1895 at the age of ninety, takes us back 
equally into the ante-bellum period, as does 
that of the romancer W. S. Mayo, author of 
" The Berber," who died in the same year at 
the age of eighty-three. Hermann Melville, 
famous for his sea tales, died in 1891, the year 
that saw the publication of Mr. Stockton's 
" Squirrel Inn " and Mr. Harris's " Balaam 
and his Master." But the gulf that separates 
us from the past is best revealed, perhaps, in 
the fact that Albert Pike, who was born in the 
same year with Poe and whose " Hymns to 



the Gods," published in " Blackwood's," de- 
lighted the readers of 1839, died compara- 
tively unnoticed in the same year with Mel- 
ville, George Bancroft, James Parton, and 
Lowell. 

But if veterans honored or practically for- 
gotten have died within our period, others have 
fortunately lived through it, and we have been 
privileged to know and admire veterans in the 
making. Mr. Donald G. Mitchell, Dr. Ed- 
ward Everett Hale, Colonel Higginson, Mr. 
C. G. Leland, Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard, 
Mr. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Professor Charles 
Eliot Norton, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe to 
mention no others belong to the first class. 
Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, Mr. Howells, 
Dr. Weir Mitchell, Mr. Clemens, Mr. Harte, 
Mr. Henry James, Jr., Mr. Stedman, obviously 
represent the second. These lists could be 
easily extended, but the names given will serve 
our purposes. 

Other names belonging to different cate- 
gories must, however, be added. Within our 
period careers that seemed to promise much in 
preceding decades have been nipped, and oth- 
ers have begun and been cut short. Sidney 
Lanier who, whatever the rank ultimately as- 
signed him, will doubtless be counted the most 
important writer the South has produced since 
Poe, succumbed in his brave fight against dis- 
ease in 1881. Helen Hunt Jackson, probably 
our greatest woman poet, died in 1885 at the 
age of fifty-four. Emma Lazarus followed her 
at the age of thirty-eight. H. C. Bunner, 
Eugene Field, Harold Frederic, and Richard 
Hovey rose to distinction within our limited 
epoch, did their work faithfully, and passed to 
their rewards. But our concern is chiefly with 
the living, to whom we may now turn with the 
remark that it may be interesting to note that 
the necrology of the two decades contains be- 
sides the names already given those of Phillips 
Brooks, H. W. Grady, Wendell Phillips, 
R. H. Dana, Jr., Francis J. Child, John Esten 
Cooke, Paul H. Hayne, John G. Saxe, James 
T. Fields, J. G. Holland, Lucy Larcom, W. W. 
Story, Richard Malcolm Johnston, Justin 
Winsor, Henry Ward Beecher, Charles A. 
Dana, Celia Thaxter, Emily Dickinson, Con- 
stance Fenimore Woolson, E. P. Whipple, 
Richard Grant White, Joseph Kirkland, and 
not a few others. 

Are our living writers, including all our vet- 
erans, equal in power and variety of perform- 
ance to their brother writers whose deaths have 
just been chronicled ? This question naturally 



336 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



forces itself upon us, but we may as well post- 
pone our answer, and perhaps evade it alto- 
gether. It is at least certain, however, that 
in point of mere numbers we who are writing 
in America to-day compose a more formidable 
body than any previous generation of writers 
has done in this country. This is naturally not 
surprising, in view of the great increase that has 
taken place in population ; but, when we com- 
pare the number of writers contemporary with 
Charles Brockden Brown with the number con- 
temporary with Mr. William Dean Howells, we 
perceive that mere growth of population cannot 
explain the phenomenon under discussion. 
Authors have multiplied in answer to greater 
trade demands made by publishers, in answer 
to the promptings of the self-conscious spirit of 
the age, and also because the spread of educa- 
tion, especially in the vernacular, has made it 
possible for more and more men and women to 
develope a fairly good style and to master at 
least the rudiments of the writer's craft. Our 
republic of letters is fast ceasing to be aristo- 
cratic in character and is becoming thoroughly 
democratic a change which is also taking 
place in the mother country. 

It is more possible to regret this change than 
to deny it. Beside our literary men and 
women of 1900 the " Literati " of the forties 
cut quite a small figure ; but where are our 
Poe and our Hawthorne? Who among our 
poets has taken Longfellow's place? Who 
equals Lowell as a critic ? What living nov- 
elist is as secure of an undying reputation as 
that old-fashioned romancer Cooper, at whom 
some of the present-day purveyors of fiction 
delight to sneer ? " Perhaps after all," a mali- 
cious observer might remark, " the real reason 
you modern writers form a democracy is that 
you have no aristocrats no really great men 
among you ! " Some of us might reply that such 
a remark would not be quite fair, that sooner 
or later 

the bell-like fame 
Of this or that down-trodden name 

will meet our eager ears, and that at least the 
authors of "Huckleberry Finn" and "The 
Rise of Silas Lapham " are great enough to 
lend respectability to the epoch. But, however 
legitimate such an answer, few of us, doubtless, 
can survey our recent literary production with- 
out concluding that with regard to the creation 
of masterpieces of imaginative literature other 
periods have surpassed us. In poetry no name 
has attained great preeminence ; in fiction, de- 
spite the phenomenal sales of certain novels, 



we have scarcely more than one book to men- 
tion in the same breath with " The Last of the 
Mohicans " and " The Scarlet Letter "; in lit- 
erary craftsmanship or art, while we can fairly 
say that there are ten good writers now to one 
in 1840, we must candidly admit that we have 
not a single name worthy to be set alongside 
that of Poe. Our strength plainly lies in the 
number of our important writers, and in the 
variety and high average merit of their work ; 
in other words, Democracy is justified of her 
children even in the domain of letters. 

Let us now take a nearer view of these wri- 
ters and their work. With comparatively little 
trouble I have made out a list of one hundred 
and fifty authors living to-day within the United 
States with the exception of one or two exiles 
all or nearly all of whom would, I think, 
deserve to have their work considered, to a fair 
extent at least, by a literary historian working 
on the scale adopted by Professor Moses Coit 
Tyler. The writer of a handbook or a school 
manual could undoubtedly afford to pass over 
a third or more of these names ; but a real in- 
vestigator of the period would not omit nearly 
so many. It is needless to say that before this 
article is printed my list will have been de- 
stroyed, and that I have no intention of giving 
it here. After all, the individual names do not 
matter much ; what does matter is the large 
total and the classes into which it may be dis- 
tributed. 

I find that of my one hundred and fifty 
names twenty-seven are poets; twenty- seven 
critics and essayists ; sixty-seven novelists ; 
nineteen historians ; and ten miscellaneous wri- 
ters whom it is difficult to classify. Of course 
some of these authors, like Mr. Howells and 
Dr. van Dyke for I do not mind saying that 
both are on my list, might easily be included 
under three of the above heads, but I have 
placed them where they seem primarily to be- 
long. Now what conclusions do these figures 
seem to suggest? 

In the first place they tell us what we already 
knew, that fiction is the dominant literary form 
of the day. They show also that criticism and 
history are holding their own well, as we should 
naturally have inferred. They prove, too, that 
writers still own allegiance to poetry, even if 
most readers do not. They show furthermore, 
I think, that the tendency to specialization of 
scholarship, so marked of late years, has not 
had quite the deleterious effect upon the pro- 
duction of real literature that might have been 
expected. Not a few of the critics, historians,

and miscellaneous writers included above are 
specialists whose minute studies have not pre- 
vented them from acquiring a broad, liberal 
culture. Finally, our figures seem to prove 
that in spite of or perhaps in reaction from 
our utilitarian character as a people, a decided 
majority of our writers who have made their 
marks have striven to succeed in the highest 
regions of imaginative literature. These as- 
piring souls may not in the end invalidate the 
judgment passed upon our literature, and more 
especially its prose, by Professor George R. 
Carpenter, to the effect that its sound, com- 
mon sense, wholesome qualities make it essen- 
tially a " citizen's literature " ; but they are 
doing their best to set it beside literatures rich 
in imaginative works, such as those of Great 
Britain and France. The literature in which 
such a tendency can be discovered is surely in 
no unhealthy state, even if it can at the time 
boast of few living writers of eminent origin- 
ality. 

But the figures given are susceptible of 
other manipulations more or less instructive. 
The list was made out with no thought as to 
the respective proportions of the two sexes rep- 
resented ; at the end it was found that they 
stood as five to one in favor of the sex that has 
hitherto dominated literature. This seems to 
be on the whole not a bad showing for our 
women, and the disparity is likely to decrease 
in the future in view of the large amount of 
reading done by women, the spread of higher 
education among them, and the remarkable 
literary activity of their various clubs. The 
showing made by them appears to be still 
more noticeable from the fact that with prac- 
tically only one exception every woman counted 
is doing work in either poetry or fiction that 
is, in the highest ranges of literature. The 
more ideal sex has the more ideal aims. 

From some points of view literature should 
know neither section nor country, but it is in- 
teresting to observe that of the one hundred 
and fifty names selected nearly one hundred 
should be credited to the North and East, and 
the remainder almost evenly divided between 
South and West. New England is still influ- 
ential, but does not dominate our literature as 
formerly. The Middle States have at last 
equaled her or surpassed her perhaps in 
consequence of the growth of a distinct school 
of literary New Yorkers ; the West has proved 
that business prosperity is not its only ideal ; 
and the New South has distinguished itself in 
no way so much as by finding in its young 



writers an articulate voice. It is true that 
many of the authors credited to the West and 
South have found it desirable to join the im- 
portant group of writers that has wrested the 
primacy from Boston and made New York the 
literary centre of the country ; but they still, 
like Mr. James Lane Allen, continue in their 
writings to smack of the soil upon which their 
youth was spent. On the other hand, this set- 
ting of the literary tide toward New York, 
which is paralleled by the similar movements 
toward London, Paris, and Berlin, is some- 
what counterbalanced by the facts that in the 
past few years Boston has shown increased ac- 
tivity in publishing, that Chicago has become 
a centre of the trade in the Northwest, and 
that even in comparatively smaller cities 
numerous important firms are stimulating 
the energy of local authors and scouring the 
country to discover fresh talent. It seems quite 
certain that from Boston to San Francisco the 
future is likely to witness a fair development of 
local writers and publishers. 

This matter of local centres is more impor- 
tant than it appears at first sight. The great 
centres of artistic and literary production in the 
past, from Athens to the Boston of the Trans- 
cendentalists, have been also centres of a homo- 
geneous population. Can a really great litera- 
ture grow up in the midst of a heterogeneous 
population, and how far are we Americans a 
heterogeneous people ? These questions con- 
front every serious student of our literature, 
and it would at least seem that our literary 
future would be more assured if we could be 
certain that the growth of New York, which is 
quite inevitable, would not prevent the devel- 
opment of local centres. Even as it is, we may 
find profit in noting that the comparatively 
homogeneous population of the South has made 
the greatest relative advance in our period, and 
that in the South, as elsewhere, it seems in the 
main to be the comparatively homogeneous 
stocks or strains of population, like those of 
Tennessee and Kentucky, that have furnished 
both writers and subjects for literary exploita- 
tion. 

From local literary centres we naturally pass 
to local fiction, and we hardly need consult any 
list of our novelists to conclude that American 
fiction since 1880 has developed more fully the 
tendency that became pronounced in the sev- 
enties to portray with minute skill the modes 
of life and thought peculiar to limited classes 
or stocks of population inhabiting limited 
areas. The Forty-niners of Bret Harte and the

Mississippi Valley types of Mark Twain have 
been succeeded by Virginia negroes, Georgia 
" crackers," Louisiana Creoles, Tennessee and 
Kentucky mountaineers, Wisconsin farmers, 
New England villagers and but the list is too 
formidable and the end is not yet. In this de- 
velopment of local fiction, which has been par- 
alleled in England and Scotland, our epoch 
stands in distinct contrast with the ante-bellum 
period, although books like Longstreet's 
" Georgia Scenes " might be cited to show that 
evolution rather than revolution has taken 
place. That the work done in the various re- 
stricted fields has been often admirable in 
quality it would be foolish to deny, but whether 
our novelists have shown sufficient knowledge 
of the human heart and mind to give their 
works currency after the manners and types 
they portray have ceased to be strange or have 
vanished before the leveling tide of civilization, 
is a question that the future alone can answer. 
Hawthorne's " House of the Seven Gables " 
still holds it own ; will posterity put any of our 
stories beside it, no matter how accurate the 
dialect or how painstaking the portraiture ? 

But some of our writers of fiction have aimed 
at wider work and, whether consciously or un- 
consciously, have taken for their master Balzac, 
the great student of society, as a whole. A 
small group of realists is treating New York in 
the manner if not with the success that Balzac 
treated Paris. The influence of Tourguenieff 
and of Tolstoy has also been felt by them, and 
they have done work distinctive in character 
and far reaching in its effects. The general 
public has received this work often with slight 
courtesy and has turned with more relish either 
to religious romances like " Ben Hur " or to 
stories of the Revolution that furnish appro- 
priate reading for the Sons and Daughters of 
that prolific cataclysm, or to the specifically 
local fiction that has just been mentioned. 
" Give us a story that is a story ", they say 
with some justice, and fall to reading a bril- 
liant colonial romance. But will the brilliant 
romances or the local fiction of a contracted 
type give the form and pressure of the time 
to inquiring posterity as well as the less ab- 
sorbing novels of our realists will ? With the 
exception of the numerous and excellent short 
stories, an admirable form of fiction in which 
Americans have succeeded since the days of 
Irving, Poe, and Hawthorne, and in which the 
period just closing has probably done more 
than merely hold its own, is not the work of 
the realists the most typical product of the 



period ? The reader must answer these ques- 
tions as he will, and, if he be wise, he will 
probably enjoy the good work his contempor- 
aries are doing regardless of the permanence 
or impermanence of its value. He may, how- 
ever, quite properly find it in his heart to re- 
gret that, in some notable cases, too great in- 
sistence upon theories of fiction has limited the 
appeal of great writers and, in one instance at 
least, has rendered the self-imposed exile of a 
distinguished novelist a matter of less regret to 
his country and of less loss to the literature of 
our period than it would otherwise have been. 

Passing now to the higher but less culti- 
vated form of imaginative literature known by 
the sacred name of poetry, we find that, as in 
so many other matters, we have closely paral- 
leled recent British experience. Indeed one 
marked characteristic of the period we are con- 
sidering is what may be termed the general 
intellectual leveling up of the two great 
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race. British 
books no longer dominate our market, and 
American books are no longer unwelcome in 
Great Britain. There is less disposition to 
colonial subservience in literary matters on 
our part and less reason for it, since modern 
British literature is not obviously superior to 
our own. As with us, so in Great Britain the 
republic of letters seems to be losing its aris- 
tocratic caste ; bizarre youth plays its pranks 
there as here ; fiction that is often good but 
seldom masterly is the dominant literary form, 
and poetry is cultivated by an increasing num- 
ber of surprisingly well-trained but still minor 
poets. 

This last phenomenon was some years since 
made the subject of an interesting article by 
the late Mr. Traill. He showed that Great 
Britain possessed at the time some half a hun- 
dred minor poets, any one of whom was 
capable of doing work that in technique at 
least would have seemed quite remarkable in 
any other epoch. Doubtless the number of 
these poets has increased in Great Britain, and, 
as I have recently said elsewhere, there is 
every reason to believe that there are just as 
many meritorious minor poets in this country. 
If the number of poets included in our list is 
less, this is because it seemed wise to count 
only those writers who had received a fair 
amount of public recognition. But anyone who 
has been called upon to review the annual out- 
put of verse in America for the last few years 
will readily admit that for minor poetry it 
often shows marked excellence of rhythm and

THE DIAL

diction, distinct poetical temperaments on the 
part of the writers, conscientious study of the 
best models in short most of the virtues of 
good poetry except the saving one of strongly 
original creative power. 

If this saving virtue be demanded, it must 
be confessed that few living American or Brit- 
ish poets will stand the test. With the deaths 
of the great New England poets and of Whit- 
man we have been left with a few true and 
fairly distinguished poets and with many minor 
ones of varying excellence, but with no great 
ones, even in the limited sense in which 
" great " can be applied to any American poet. 
Every year or two a new poet is hailed by his 
friends, and the ear of the public twitches ; 
but that is about all, even though the poet sells 
a few thousand copies of his book and makes 
his appearance on the lecture platform. Nor 
is anybody to blame for this state of things. 
The public is right in not being stirred by 
what is obviously not stirring, although this is 
not saying that it cannot be aroused to unnec- 
essary enthusiasm over the rather brazen ring 
of some contemporary verse. On the other 
hand, the friends of our poets are right in 
standing by them loyally, for many of them 
have distinct merits, and it is not well that the 
cause of the fine art they are faithfully serving 
should want defenders. After all, neither a 
people nor a generation need feel ashamed if 
great poets are conspicuous by their absence. 
Our race has known poetic interregnums be- 
fore, and the present one will probably cease 
ere long. 

Meanwhile two facts are interesting. The 
first is that even in the most out-of-the-way 
localities young poets, often of distinct ability, 
are serving the muse in spite of public neglect 
and of the pressure of our complex life. These 
men are influencing their communities for good 
and will at least help to smooth the paths of 
great poets when they come. The second fact 
is the attention our two most original poets, 
Poe and Walt Whitman, are receiving. The 
Poe cult has been sufficiently discussed in these 
columns ; that of Whitman has probably not 
been adequately recognized by orthodox criti- 
cism. That many of the claims made for our 
rugged chanter of the glories of democracy are 
extravagant, is doubtless true ; but it is equally 
true that his voice has a carrying quality that 
makes it penetrate ears deaf to all other poetry. 
This is but another proof of the democratiza- 
tion of our literature, and it is a proof that the 
process has its advantages as well as its disad- 



vantages. In this connection it is interesting 
to note that the natural Whitman has found 
one of his stoutest champions in a student of 
nature and a disciple of Thoreau, Mr. John 
Burroughs, whose work is typical of a kind of 
writing to which more and more Americans 
are devoting themselves and which is not un- 
worthy of being mentioned in connection even 
with poetry itself. 

The mention of Mr. Burroughs makes the 
transition to criticism easy, but the space re- 
maining to me is limited and I must hasten to 
a conclusion. American criticism seems to be 
in a healthy state so far as the ability of our 
critics is concerned ; but, as I have tried to show 
elsewhere, there is still much to be done toward 
attaining an adequate critical philosophy. We 
have critics who are learned, critics of admira- 
ble taste, and critics gifted with the power of 
interpreting literature to the masses, but few 
or none of large mould and speaking with au- 
thoritative voice. Perhaps this fact is due in 
part to the character of the age, which has no 
great respect for authority of any sort ; but it 
is at least quite as much due to a lack of stand- 
ards and philosophic methods on the part of the 
critics themselves. But when all is said, the 
generation that has produced such a book as 
Professor Lounsbury's " Studies in Chaucer," 
and that can point to at least a dozen success- 
ful essayists, can hold its own in criticism with 
any that has preceded it. 

The same statement may be made with re- 
gard to history, biography, economics, and pol- 
itics, and classical scholarship, so far as concerns 
the literary character of the chief recent works 
in these departments of thought. As our great- 
est critic died in Lowell, so probably our 
greatest historian died in Parkman, yet history 
in general has not merely not lost in the past 
twenty years but has actually gained. Owing 
to the influence of graduate schools in connec- 
tion with our great universities, the spirit of 
accurate historical research has spread through- 
out the land. This research has been carried 
on in the main by specialists often deficient in 
literary gifts, but their methods have affected 
more ambitious and talented historians, with 
the result that a large number of elaborate his- 
torical works have been written within our 
period that would be a credit to any people 
and to any age. It is impossible to specify 
them all, but perhaps it will not be invidious 
to lay special stress upon the histories of Mr. 
John Fiske and of Mr. Henry Adams as illus- 
trating the truth of what has just been said.

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



As for biography, economics, and classical 
scholarship still less can be said here. Recent 
work in these lines has been especially note- 
worthy and is likely to continue so certainly 
in economics in which the public finds many 
reasons to take a vital interest. The taste for 
biographical reading is also growing, and in 
General Grant's " Memoirs " at least the gen- 
eration has probably produced a classic. If the 
work of Professor Gildersleeve in the domain 
of Greek scholarship and culture is less popu- 
larly known, it is a comfort to some of us to 
think that we have in him an American fully 
worthy to rank with Professor Jebb himself. 

Several topics remain that deserve discus- 
sion, but they can now be mentioned only. 
The last twenty years have seen great devel- 
opments in periodical literature. The more 
expensive magazines have kept their standing, 
and cheap magazines, some good, some poor, 
have made literature popular as it never was 
before. The newspapers, too, are paying more 
attention to literature than ever and find that 
it pays to issue special literary supplements. 
Reviews of all sorts have been established, al- 
though in the main technical in character. 
Cheap libraries of books famous and infamous 
have had immense sales. Literary clubs of all 
sorts have fostered a taste for reading and 
have thus stimulated literary production. Pub- 
lishers have adopted the larger business meth- 
ods of the epoch and keep the presses running 
night and day. With their numerous series of 
all sorts they secure for new authors sales that 
would be otherwise impossible ; but on the 
other hand they are insatiate in their demands 
upon all available writers, and the result is 
hasty, immature work that is demoralizing 
both to author and to reader. Publishers are 
also partly responsible for the fact that their 
popular books, which they naturally advertise 
in every way possible, often overshadow and 
prevent the sale of more deserving volumes. 
For this state of affairs the public is, however, 
just as much to blame, for it allows itself to be 
seized by a craze or fad and devours books 
eagerly which in a short time it is only too will- 
ing to forget. The end is not yet, nor can any 
man predict with certainty what effect modern 
conditions of literary productivity will have on 
at least the higher forms of literature. Will 
our children or grandchildren take fiction seri- 
ously if every week in the year sees a new 
novel reach the hundred thousand mark ? But 
our concern is not with the future, and as for 
the immediate past it can be safely affirmed, 



in conclusion, that whether the period we have 
just left behind us be a great one or not, it is 
certainly an interesting one, as well as one 
that proves that we have not fallen behind in 
letters as we have in politics. From Charles 
Brockden Brown to William Dean Howells is 
a distinct ascent ; facilis est descensus from 
Thomas Jefferson to any living American 
statesman. Yet it seemed, years ago, that our 
true glory lay in the political sphere. 

WILLIAM P. TRENT. 



AMERICAN PUBLISHING AND 
PUBLISHERS. 



"A thousand ages were blank, if books had 
not evoked their ghosts," wrote Bulwer ; and 
THE DIAL'S twenty years of life crowd them- 
selves with the ghosts of many ages. Within 
the narrow confines of a score of years, pro- 
gress has been made for which the elder world 
waited centuries in vain. Great as our ma- 
terial advance has been in the two closing de- 
cades of the century, our intellectual life has kept 
pace with it ; and of this progress the best rec- 
ord and epitome is to be found in books. 

The first glance backward is therefore one 
of congratulation. But the books, their authors 
and publishers, have come and many of them 
have gone, leaving the mind overstocked with 
memories and crowded with reflections. Dur- 
ing THE DIAL'S twenty years, the world of 
English letters has been robbed of the great 
names of Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, 
Lowell, Holmes, Lanier, Whitman, and Park- 
man in America ; of Tennyson, Browning, 
Arnold, Rossetti, and Morris in England ; 
with scores of lesser authors in both lands. 
With these have passed away many of the men 
who made the reading public acquainted with 
these authors, James T. Fields, Daniel S. 
Appleton, Henry O. Houghton, J. B. Lippin- 
cott, Fletcher Harper (second of that name), 
Charles Welford, James R. Osgood, Robert 
Clarke, Edward S. Mead, with other names of 
power and influence in the world of books. 
A score of years ago, books of poetry which 
attracted hundreds and even thousands of read- 
ers were appearing with every season; now, 
more books of verse are put forth than ever 
before, but the names their publishers used to 
conjure with are absent. In other fields it is 
the same. To join the present and that not 
remote past of which we speak, Messrs. Sted-

man, Aldrich, Stoddard, Warner, Mitchell, 
Howells, James, Stockton, and Eggleston still 
flourish in America ; Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Aus- 
tin Dobson, Sir Walter Besant, and several 
more, in England ; but the times have changed, 
and many of the names now most prominent in 
current letters were unknown when THE DIAL 
began its course. 

In 1880, a few great houses controlled the 
publishing business in America, and not many 
smaller houses flourished beside them. In 
other businesses centralization has since been 
the rule of growth, and this is no exception ; 
yet the number of publishers seems to have 
multiplied even more than the number of 
books. The great houses survive the lon- 
gevity of authors, almost proverbial, seeming 
to extend to the men whose function it is to 
make the author possible in his relations with 
the public ; and there is probably no commer- 
cial occupation which can show names more 
old and venerable than those which stand as 
monuments in the book-producing world. The 
repute of publishing as the trade most nearly 
resembling a learned profession is fully sus- 
tained by the new blood which has flowed into 
its veins. The older men, gone from the gen- 
eration now passing, were men of sound char- 
acter and cultivated minds, and their example 
has been followed, until, with rare exceptions, 
the American publisher stands well for Amer- 
ican character and culture. 

Twenty years have brought many changes in 
the artistic and mechanical sides of bookmak- 
ing, not all of them commendable, but on the 
whole tending toward a finer and wider devel- 
opment of art. Chiefly noticeable are the great 
increase in the quality and quantity, of illustra- 
tion brought about through improved pictorial 
processes, the increased attention paid to cover 
designs, calling into service a body of artists 
of which the older generation had not dreamed, 
and the frequent use of color, even to the point 
of landscape effects, on book covers. The use 
of color in illustration, particularly in maga- 
zines, is also a recent innovation, still some- 
what in the stage of experiment. The intro- 
duction of machine devices in book production, 
such as the linotype substitute for type-setting, 
has been indulged in but cautiously by the best 
publishers, and whatever lowering of standards 
has come from these processes has been more 
than offset by improved faces of founders' type 
and by the common use of better grades of 
paper made possible by the cheapening of 
staple manufactures generally. In the form of 



the best books, the tendency has been toward 
simple elegance instead of costly show. The 
elaborate and ponderous editions which 
weighted down the book-shelves of our fathers 
have mostly gone their way, and in their stead 
thrives the sort of modest but more artistic 
volume which challenges comparison with the 
work of the old master printers. 

In the great book publishing houses of 
America it is peculiarly true that though the 
individual wither yet the firm is more and 
more. These are the houses that are built on 
broad and deep foundations, and though the 
members that compose them are taken one by 
one yet the house still stands. Even the very 
recent financial complications of two of the 
oldest and largest firms in the country, start- 
ling as they were, are not likely to affect seri- 
ously their future usefulness and prosperity, 
and thus while saddening are not discouraging. 
In the first number of THE DIAL there ap- 
peared the advertisements of just ten Ameri- 
can publishing houses a striking contrast to 
the nearly one hundred firms appearing in the 
present issue and of these ten firms all but 
two are still in active existence, while there is 
hardly one of them but has lost meanwhile a 
prominent and active member. A few details, 
reviving memories of earlier days, may not be 
out of place in this necessarily brief survey. 

The same day that saw the birth of THE 
DIAL saw also the separation of the historic 
firm of Houghton, Osgood & Co. into the two 
houses of Houghton, Mifflin & Co. and J. R. 
Osgood & Co.; the former continuing to stand 
distinctively for literary conservatism and 
classic simplicity of typography and ornament, 
while the latter devoted itself more particularly 
to the heliotype reproduction of old engravings 
of merit, foreshadowing those extensive photo- 
graphic processes which have since made artis- 
tic illustration possible for almost every book. 
Both Mr. Houghton and Mr. Osgood, as also 
Mr. Fields their immemorial predecessor, have 
since passed away. Other Boston firms of our 
initial period were Little, Brown, & Co., trac- 
ing their origin back to 1784, and conducting 
business under the present name unchanged 
since 1847 ; Roberts Brothers, absorbed by the 
firm just named after the death of Mr. Niles 
of genial memory ; Ginn, Heath & Co., since 
divided into the two houses of Ginn & Co. and 
D. C. Heath & Co., each since becoming far 
more extensive than the parent house ; T. Y. 
Crowell & Co., lately removed to New York 
City ; Lee & Shepard, continuing the firm

name unaffected by the death of Mr. Shepard 
and the retirement of Mr. Lee ; D. Lothrop & 
Co., since incorporated as the Lothrop Pub- 
lishing Company on the death of Mr. Daniel 
Lothrop ; and Estes & Lauriat, who were suc- 
ceeded in 1898 in their publishing department 
by Dana Estes & Co. 

Turning to New York, we find the house of 
Harper & Brothers, already over sixty years 
old when THE DIAL was born, changing from 
a co-partnership to a corporation in 1896 ; 
Mr. Fletcher Harper, long an active member 
of this firm, being included in the death-roll of 
our score of years. D. Appleton & Co. had 
been a firm for over half a century, having 
been founded in 1825 by Daniel Appleton, 
father of the Daniel S. Appleton whose death 
occurred a few years ago. The firm of Charles 
Scribner's Sons also began many years before 
our period, taking its present name in 1878 ; 
the importing branch of its business was long 
done by the allied house of Scribner & Wei- 
ford, which was merged with the parent house 
six years after the death of Mr. Welford in 
1885. In 1870 Scribner's Sons established a 
magazine department under the name of Scrib- 
ner & Co., from which descended one of the 
present great houses, The Century Co., in 
which Dr. Holland and Mr. Roswell C. Smith, 
now both deceased, were leading and vital 
spirits, and made the house famous not only 
for its magazines but for its monumental en- 
terprises, of which the great Century Diction- 
ary is a fit example. G. P. Putnam's Sons 
took their name as a co-partnership in 1873, 
incorporating in 1892, when their manufac- 
turing business was turned over to an allied 
company called The Knickerbocker Press. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. took their present name in 
1870, retaining it unchanged by the death of 
Mr. Mead in 1894. The business of Henry Holt 
& Co. was begun in 1866, the present name 
being taken in 1873, when the firm was al- 
ready prominent and influential. Notable 
among the deaths of our period is that of Mr. 
Frederick Leypoldt, one of the founders of the 
house last named, and ever gratefully remem- 
bered for his American Catalogue and other 
serviceable bibliographical work. E. P. Dutton 
& Co., Fords, Howard, & Hulbert, John Wiley 
& Sons, A. S. Barnes & Co., A. C. Armstrong 
& Son, E. & J. B. Young & Co., and Baker & 
Taylor Co., are recalled among the firms in 
existence at THE DIAL'S initial period. 

In Philadelphia, J. B. Lippincott & Co. had 
been publishing under that title since 1855, 



though tracing their origin back to 1798. 
After the death of Mr. J. B. Lippincott, in 
1886, the firm was changed to a corporation, 
which continues its extensive business un- 
checked by the disastrous fire of a few months 
ago. The firm of Porter & Coates was well 
known long before THE DIAL was, becoming 
Henry T. Coates & Co. a few years ago. In 
Cincinnati, Robert Clarke & Co. had led an 
honorable existence for many years among the 
pioneers of Western publishing houses, con- 
tinuing as a corporation since the recent death 
of Mr. Clarke, the founder. In Chicago, the 
trade has long been led by A. C. McClurg & 
Co., now a corporation, and the earliest pub- 
lishers of THE DIAL. Also in Chicago at the 
beginning of our period were the well-known 
religious house of Fleming H. Revell Co., the 
law firm of Callaghan & Co., Henry A. Sum- 
ner & Co., since gone out of business, and S. C. 
Griggs & Co., whose business was transferred, 
on the death of Mr. Griggs, to Scott, Foresman 
& Co., who still continue it. Rand, McNally 
& Co., Laird & Lee, C. H. Sergei Company, 
H. S. Stone & Co., and the Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co., have all entered the active field since 
THE DIAL began its career. 

That other houses besides those we have 
named were in existence in this country at the 
beginning of the period covered by our sketch, 
is only too probable ; as also that other names 
of honor and influence have been taken from 
the publishing world, and are borne in mem- 
ory, though not set down in recollections so 
disconnected and fragmentary. But if it has been 
found impossible, within the necessary limits, 
to include all the old established houses of a 
score of years ago, what can be done toward 
mentioning the houses that have since come 
into being ? A novel feature of recent years 
has been the appearance of a number of firms 
which were, somewhat distinctively, composed 
of young men, ardent, confident, full of en- 
terprise, often with original ideas of consider- 
able value, sometimes expecting too much of 
these ideas and hoping that with them they 
would revolutionize or conquer the publishing 
world. They have not revolutionized it ; not 
all of them have even made themselves a place 
in it. But they have not been without their 
influence, and a certain improvement in artistic 
taste and a quickening of ideas may doubtless 
be traced to the influence of these young men. 
Prominent among houses established since 
the founding of THE DIAL may be mentioned 
the firm of White, Stokes & Allen, now con- 



1900.]

ducting its extensive business under the more 
recent corporate name of the Frederick A. 
Stokes Company ; while latest, in point of time, 
is the young Hercules firm of Doubleday & 
McClure Co., founded in 1897 and growing so 
vigorously that one house soon became too 
small to hold all the members, and there re- 
sulted the firm of Doubleday, Page & Co., the 
McClure firm still continuing, all three big with 
life and enterprise. The newer comers who have 
won distinction and made their impression in 
the publishing field are of course too numerous 
to mention in the limited space at our disposal. 
A word might be given to certain names 
which suggest some noteworthy modern inno- 
vations in book production, such names as 
Thomas B. Mosher of Portland, Maine, El- 
bert Hubbard and his " Roycroft Press," and 
the " Brothers of the Book," all indicating a 
certain tendency which is not without signifi- 
cance to the reading and the publishing worlds. 

It would be interesting, did space and time 
permit, to consider the growth and present con- 
dition of the subscription book trade, but this 
is hardly within the scope of this survey. 
Neither are text -books, properly speaking, 
though this field of publication has had an 
enormous development in the past twenty years, 
as shown by the organization and prosperity of 
the great American Book Company and other 
large concerns. The extension of many of the 
religious publication societies, practically every 
denomination now having its publishing estab- 
lishment, into the field of general publishing, 
is also a feature to be mentioned. Finally, if 
we notice the increased activity of the various 
University presses of Harvard, Columbia, 
Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, and 
other of the large institutions of learning and 
culture we shall see how varied in interest 
and how vast in total is the book output of the 
United States. 

Even an incomplete survey of American 
publishing interests for the past twenty years 
must not omit to mention International Copy- 
right, which was adopted by the United States 
in 1891, and must have had some important 
effects upon the trade, though just what these 
effects have been no one can very definitely 
say. Whether or not it has done all that its 
more zealous advocates had hoped, it was un- 
questionably a policy of justice, and has un- 
doubtedly been of help to American authors 
both at home and in England. The American 
market has become an object of greater inter- 
est to the English publishing houses, an in- 



creasing number of whom have found it to 
their advantage to maintain their business on 
both sides of the sea. The chief example of 
this class is of course the great house of Mac- 
millau & Co., whose American business has 
had an enormous development under the man- 
agement of Mr. George P. Brett, who suc- 
ceeded his father, Mr. George E. Brett, upon 
the death of the latter some ten years ago. 
The well-known houses, of Longmans, Green, 
& Co., of Thomas Nelson's Sons, of John 
Lane, of the Oxford University Press, and of 
George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., are also to be 
included among* the active and influential firms 
that are international in character, whose po- 
sition makes it easier for an author to procure 
the introduction of his work to those who speak 
the same tongue everywhere, whether in En- 
gland, America, or the colonies. One of the 
results of this has been the enormous demand 
for novels immediately upon their production,, 
testifying in a remarkable manner to the close- 
ness of the tie that binds the English and 
American reading public together. The first 
American book for which a large demand was 
had was " Uncle Tom's Cabin." But this sale 
was of slow growth, and for reasons other than 
literary. Not long after THE DIAL'S birth, 
Mrs. Humphry Ward attracted the attention 
of the reading public in both England and 
America with "Robert Elsmere"; but here 
again, though the story had merit as literature, 
its success was due largely to the theological 
questions involved. But Dr. Mitchell's " Hugh 
Wynne " attained an international vogue which 
can hardly be referred to other than a literary 
cause; and this is true, successively, of Mr. 
Winston Churchill's "Richard Carvel," Mr. 
Ford's "Janice Meredith," and Miss Johnston's 
" To Have and To Hold," all of which deal with 
colonial and revolutionary times, of interest, 
apparently, to the English-speaking race. 

Taking leave of the past as seen in this in- 
adequate survey, we turn to the future which 
ever lies bright before us. So far as appears 
to even the experienced eye, there has never 
been a period of greater promise in the pub- 
lishing trade of the United States, and the 
revival waited for during many weary months 
shows no sign of waning, on the contrary, the 
indications point to a memorable series of years r 
in which the author, the publisher, and the 
rapidly-growing reading public will combine to- 
give the publishing trade in America a period 
of unprecedented prosperity.

THE DIAL 



AMERICAN BOOKSELLING AND 
BOOKSELLERS. 

When THE DIAL started its effort for the 
betterment of things literary, twenty years ago, 
its projectors had plans of their own, and ideals 
to be achieved, and though progress has been 
made and results reached, still it can be seen 
that contentment will not be had until more 
and more progress is secured. Truly, it is the 
law of life and will not be denied. Twenty 
years ago is not so very far back, and yet what 
a crowding of events there has been, and what 
a multitude of changes have come to pass since 
then ! In printing we have passed from the 
staid and plain and solid, to the brilliant and 
many-tinted or more deeply colored ; and 
coupled with the changes there has been such 
attention to the details and niceties of the art 
that unlimited admiration has followed, and 
rightly too. 

It may be said at once that bookselling in 
America is more of a science to-day than ever 
before ; that the scale on which it is conducted 
is broader and higher, and the lines laid more 
intelligently and to better purpose. The finer 
and better equipped bookstores are furnished 
with stocks such as the world never before 
saw collected together for mercantile pur- 
poses, and the books are displayed in such 
inviting ways as to attract the buyer to first 
examine and then to purchase. And this is 
done without intent to trick or inveigle buyers, 
by artifice or design, to buy that which they 
do not need or would not otherwise invest in ; 
the individual items are put in convenient 
places to be handled, in assortments that are 
intelligible to any observant mind, and classi- 
fied so that the whole line of any one class in 
the stock itself can be gone over by the cus- 
tomer, and he readily find the special book he 
may be seeking, and many more covering the 
same field. It follows, of course, that cus- 
tomers are oftentimes astonished and delighted 
at finding books of equal value with the ones 
they came to buy, and they go happily away 
with one or more additional volumes to for- 
tify them in their reading or study of the 
subjects involved. It can be seen how by this 
method the bookseller is benefitted, for it not 
only increases the present sales from his stock, 
but the customer who finds himself so aided in 
one case is pretty certain to return in the 
future, as often as he can possibly do so. 

Another result in such an arrangement of 
stock is that the clerks become more and more 



intelligent and helpful. The very assorting of 
stock in classes leads to definiteness of under- 
standing as to what books of value there are on 
a given subject, and, when that is known, to the 
other and better point of which of them all is 
the best on its topic. It then only remains to 
suit the supply to the particular needs of the 
customer on the subject in hand, to completely 
satisfy the ideal requirements for which book- 
stores should be established. 

In the larger and finer class of bookstores 
referred to, as may be imagined, it is necessary 
that the salesmen be not only well posted, but 
cultivated to a high degree in the expert knowl- 
edge of their craft. Even to the most pains- 
taking of them this requires time and perse- 
verence and concentration of thought ; and it 
is a pleasure to record that there are now in 
this country a considerable number who can 
rightly be called masters in their field. To 
those of the readers of THE DIAL who travel, 
it will only be necessary to make clear the 
style of bookstore to which reference is made, 
to mention, in New York, Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons, Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, 
and Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.; in Boston, 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. and Charles E. 
Lauriat Co.; in Cleveland, Burrows Brothers 
Company and Helman-Taylor Company ; and 
last but not least, in Chicago, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. Many more could be men- 
tioned, but these will suffice to prove that the 
highest intelligence is bestowed, and an al- 
most unlimited amount of capital invested, in 
these businesses ; that to every such establish- 
ment is given the greatest care in detail ; and 
that the results achieved are only secured by 
taxing to the utmost the energies and atten- 
tion of those in charge. All honor is due to 
such men, and should be liberally bestowed by 
those to whose wants they cater, and for whose 
edification and gratification they give their on- 
erous, though often delightful, labors. The 
buyers of books should appreciate this, and 
should be ready to pay for such services that 
which will afford a profit commensurate with 
the benefits bestowed. In the larger cities this 
is recognized and granted, and the best that 
the world produces can consequently be found 
on the shelves of the bookstores. 

In bookselling, as everybody knows, there 
are differing phases brought about by locality 
or other circumstances. A college town book- 
store, for instance, will be looked to for tech- 
nical books covering fields other than those 
fixed for study, and beyond or in advance of 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



345 



them. These are such as will be recommended 
by professors for post-graduates for private 
study, to those who wish to go beyond the lim- 
its of any college or university course. That 
the bookseller should have these goes without 
saying ; but it must be remembered by buyers 
that their purchases of these must be made of 
their local dealer, or he will ultimately avoid 
keeping them. It is such stock that rapidly 
uses up capital, and without the constant sup- 
port of the local buyer it will prove a source 
of loss to the dealer, rather than profit. To 
give him that support is his just due, and the 
with-holding of it is that which sometimes 
causes buyers to inveigh (causelessly) against 
the bookseller. Every bookseller will keep a 
full stock if it will pay him to do so ; and the 
more prompt and ready the purchasers, the 
more varied and complete will be the stock. 

The booksellers in the smaller cities have 
had to face several changes. In not every case 
has the town or city grown larger, and where 
it has, it has not necessarily meant a propor- 
tionate increase of book buyers. The dealer 
has striven, under changing conditions, to keep 
pace with changing tastes and, where possible, 
to build up an enlarged trade. Purchases have 
been larger, but expenses heavier in proportion, 
and the profit on the increased amount has 
often been less than of old. This, of course, 
has been discouraging to some, and enterprise 
has been nipped in the bud and effort to over- 
come the conditions has ceased. Inasmuch as 
the population of this country is sure to in- 
crease everywhere, it is to be hoped that those 
thus affected by belittlement of results will 
soon find a proper reward for their enterprise 
and labor, and be encouraged to continue until 
success is renewed. 

A striking feature of recent times is the 
popularity of certain historical novels, some of 
which have reached sales of unusually high 
numbers. Of " Eichard Carvel " there have 
been sold 430,000 copies ; " David Harum," 
500,000 ; "To Have and to Hold," 200,000; 
"Janice Meredith," 250,000; "Ked Rock," 
84,000 ; and the call for them still continues 
unabated. The definite reason for these phe- 
nomenal sales is not easily ascertained. The 
books themselves each have merit of a high 
order, and the same public is appealed to in 
each case by their publishers, who advertise in 
about the same journals. But the fact remains 
that these volumes are read by their hundreds 
of thousands of readers, and have become the 
topic of discussion in all quarters. They are, 



for the time, "the fashion," and there is no 
knowing when the public will cease to give 
them attention for some newer idols. It would 
be an interesting question to settle, on behalf 
of good literature, if by the sale of such items 
a maximum could be named for the sale of a 
genuinely high-class novel, in this land of sev- 
enty-five millions of people. 

For more than the particular twenty years 
with which we are especially concerned, there 
has been a disturbing element entering into 
the bookselling situation, to the great and in- 
creasing discomfort of those whose living has 
depended solely on bookselling, namely, the 
sale of books in " Department " stores ; more 
strictly, the sale of them there at " cut " prices. 
It would be folly to go over the discussion 
again in the ways so frequently used. The 
subject is threadbare, and certainly is unpleas- 
ant in many ways. It may be said, however, 
that better conditions exist to-day than for- 
merly, and that it is possible that some routine 
may be followed that will bring a measure of 
relief. 

The complaint has been just, that in the be- 
ginning, and for most of the period, the De- 
partment stores have offered popular books 
which were leaders in their time at wholesale 
prices to retail buyers, and at times at lower 
prices than they could be bought for by the 
bookseller. The harm came because the book- 
seller was deprived of his rightful profit on 
books that were selling freely, and was com- 
pelled to eke out a living on the items that sold 
one by one. In the Department stores the 
popular books have been sold without profit, 
and sometimes at a loss, that these books might 
be used as " leaders " or inducements to get 
patrons to come into their stores. A profit 
was then secured through the customer's pur- 
chases of other goods, on which a margin could 
be made. The result was that many men were 
driven out of the book business, and others 
were compelled to change the proper methods 
of a lifetime to meet conditions thus wrongly 
thrust upon them. We pass all the details of 
this to say that it seems that to-day the book- 
buying public are using the bookstores more 
freely ; that they find that the cheaper books 
offered them are not of the quality that they 
wish to have in their libraries ; that therefore 
they seek the better ones where they can be 
had ; and that many of the Department stores 
are thrown more upon the sales of their " cheap" 
volumes. It remains true, however, that every 
few months a furore is created by some De- 



346 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



partment store offering the particular popular 
book of the moment at a very low figure, with 
the resulting demoralization of all local trade 
in the item itself. It looks as though the evil 
cannot be cured wholly, but it also has appeared 
of late that the tendency is towards less " cut- 
ting," and that the Department stores are find- 
ing it to their benefit to secure a better average 
price on even the " popular " items. In some 
localities they are even agreeing not to cut 
prices below an average rate, the latter being 
quite reasonable by comparison with the ex- 
treme cuts made before. 

To illustrate the loss entailed on somebody 
by cut prices, an example might be taken of 
"Richard Carvel," of which 400,000 copies 
have been sold. 

The retail price of the book is $1.50 

It sells in many Department stores at .... 1.14 
When sold at an extreme " cut " price has been . .81 
Which shows a difference per copy of 33 

Multiply the whole edition by that difference, 
and we have a loss of profit of $132,000 on 
that one book alone. If the Department stores 
sold half the edition at the cut price named, they 
have given to the retail buyers $66,000, or if 
only one-fourth the edition, $33,000 in amount. 
It is not claimed that these quantities are 
known to have been sold at the lowest price 
quoted, but the ratio of loss is true, no matter 
what the quantity may be, and it is manifest 
folly to sacrifice stock in any such way. 

The parties effecting the larger sale of books, 
next to the retail bookseller, are the " Jobbers," 
and of them only carefully chosen words should 
be said. In earlier times, if one should have 
tried to set down their names, he would have 
found almost a legion of them. Every large 
city had at least one such dealer who could be 
classed under that head, since he distinctly 
made efforts to supply his fellow booksellers 
with stock that he did not expect to use in his 
own retailing department. To a degree such 
dealers are still to be found in all sections, but 
owing to radical changes in the extending of 
population in some cases, and in the changing 
of people to larger centres in others, two results 
have been produced. The larger city book- 
sellers can buy stock in quantities great enough 
to secure bottom rates, direct from the pub- 
lishers, thus doing away with the need of the 
middle-man (the jobber). On the other hand, 
the smaller booksellers have been compelled to 
look for very small quantities of many pub- 
lishers' books from fewer jobbers, and thus the 
jobbers have temporarily found their number 



of customers increased and they themselves 
obliged to keep larger stocks to supply the 
larger variety of trade catered to. It can be 
seen that this latter method of stocking-up 
must drive out, as it has, the jobber of smaller 
means, and permit the one with larger means 
to take the trade. This has come about, and 
to-day there are comparatively few jobbers in 
the field. Though there are others, essentially 
the jobbers of to-day are Messrs. A. C. Mc- 
Clurg & Co., of Chicago, The Baker & Taylor 
Co., The American News Co., and The H. B. 
Claflin Co., of New York, and Messrs. De- 
Wolfe, Fiske & Co., of Boston. It is to be 
hoped that these concerns reap a proper re- 
ward for their toil and risk. It is probably the 
most exhausting branch of the trade, requiring 
large capital with which to purchase stock, 
unusual wisdom and discrimination in selecting 
and buying, and, as can easily be shown, giving 
but the slightest margin of profit with a very 
large ratio of risk. Truly it requires great 
courage on the part of new men to enter it, 
and gives no adequate profit for the expendi- 
ture of energy and money in conducting it. 
The members of the book trade, as a whole, 
can thank their good fortune that they are able 
to secure the services of the painstaking men 
who now supply their wants in this line, and 
they should pay them liberally for the efforts 
they put forth to fill their orders.

AMERICAN LIBRARIES. 



The present status of American Libraries, 
and their significance and value in our busy 
life, can best be understood by a brief glance 
at their development. The school and the 
library have been closely connected as a part 
of our educational equipment, and have come 
up through stages of development which are 
closely parallel. 

We have, broadly speaking, first, the college 
and other institutions for higher education ; 
second, the private and endowed schools for 
secondary education ; and finally the free pub- 
lic school. On the other hand, from the be- 
ginning, we have had the college and other 
special libraries for the scholar ; then came the 
proprietary and subscription library, of the 
type of the Philadelphia Library Company, 
founded in 1732 ; and finally the Library free 
to all, of which the oldest is the Boston Public 



1900.] 



THE DIAL, 



347 



Library, founded in 1852. Thus the college 
library is as old as the college itself, the first 
being that of Harvard, 1636 ; the subscription 
library is well along in its second century ; 
and the public library is a little less than a 
half century old. 

The first general statistics of libraries in 
America were published by the Commissioner 
of Education in 1876. At that time there 
were 12,000,000 volumes in 2,500 libraries. 
In 1896 there were 33,000,000 in 4,000 ; and, 
as we know that the growth has been rapid 
since that time, it is fair to assume that there 
are now in the libraries of the country about 
40,000,000 volumes. 

This wonderful growth has been due in part 
to fostering legislation. Until recently this 
was mainly permissive, granting charters, and 
authorizing but not requiring the levy of taxes 
for library support. Some recent legislation 
gives active assistance by means of State Li- 
brary Commissions and travelling libraries, 
and finally, in 1895, New Hampshire passed 
the first law making the establishment and 
support of libraries compulsory, thus putting 
them on the same footing as the schools. 

The growth of libraries has been much 
promoted by many generous benefactions. 
Notable among these are the Astor, Lenox, 
and Tilden gifts, now united in one founda- 
tion as the New York Public Library; the 
gift of John Crerar, $3,000,000, and of 
W. N. Newberry, $2,000,000, to Chicago; 
of George Peabody, $1,400,000, and of 
Enoch Pratt, $1,200,000, to Baltimore; and 
of Benjamin Rush, $1,500,000, to Philadel- 
phia. Far exceeding any of these in amount 
are the many gifts of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. 
In addition to his numerous previous donations 
and foundations, Mr. Carnegie has given since 
the beginning of 1899 about $7,000,000 as his 
contribution to library extension in America. 
Most of the gifts mentioned have been made 
within the past twenty years, and in addition to 
these we might enumerate a score of others 
varying from $50,000 to $500,000, and many 
smaller ones. 

This rapid growth of the older collections 
has required, and has in part received, more 
adequate housing. Twenty years ago the old 
Boston Public Library building was regarded 
as one of the best library buildingrs in the 

/ o 

country, the Chicago Public Library occupied 
quarters in the City Hall, and the Library of 
Congress had poorly lighted rooms in the 
Capitol, crowded to the last degree of incon- 



venience. Now the Congressional Library, 
which is really the National Library, and 
should be so designated, occupies one of the 
most noble structures on the face of the planet, 
by far the largest and finest building ever 
erected for library purposes. Boston has front- 
ing on Copley Square, and Chicago looking 
out on the lake front, the greatest Public Li- 
brary buildings in the country. The cost of the 
Congressional Library building was $6,300,- 
000 ; that of Boston cost $2,300,000 ; and that 
of Chicago $2,000,000 ; in round numbers, ex- 
clusive of the sites. Milwaukee has just com- 
pleted a building costing $500,000 ; and in 
various cities, East and West, are library build- 
ings costing from $100,000 to $300,000. 

The most noteworthy American college 
library building is that of Columbia Univer- 
sity, occupying a commanding location on 
Morningside Heights, overlooking the great 
city and the Hudson. It was the gift of the 
president of the university, as a memorial of 
his father. Princeton, Cornell, and other uni- 
versities and colleges, have fine modern build- 
ings. All of those mentioned, with the excep- 
tion of the last one, have been completed within 
the past ten years. 

I have thus far spoken only of that which is 
outward and visible, the buildings, the books, 
the financial support. This wonderful increase 
in these material and measurable things has 
been accompanied by a scarcely less wonderful 
development and improvement of methods, an 
enlargement of the library field in extent, and 
an increase in the variety and value of its vari- 
ous activities. A comparison will best show 
this. Less than twenty years ago, when the first 
meeting of the American Library Association 
was held, the need of any special training for 
library work was not yet recognized, nor was 
there any provision for it. Now there are four 
well established library schools, those of the 
State University of New York, the State Uni- 
versity of Illinois, the Pratt and the Drexel 
Institutes. These give courses of one, or two 
years, devoted exclusively to the study of library 
methods, and the necessary technical training. 
Their graduates may be found in libraries in 
all parts of the country, and they have had 
great influence in elevating the standard of 
library work. When the first Association 
meeting was held, most librarians were using 
their own methods of charging, classification, 
and cataloguing, many of them cumbrous, un- 
reliable, and ineffective. There were no rec- 
ognized standards, or generally approved meth- 



348

[May 1, 



ods. Now, the principles of library accounting 
are as well understood, and taught as definitely 
and exactly, as commercial book-keeping. Now 
there are approved systems of library classifi- 
cation, to which guides are published, and 
which are generally adopted. Then, however 
broad and thorough the scholarship of the cat- 
aloguer, much of his work failed to reach its 
full measure of usefulness from the lack of a 
well understood plan. Now systematic work, 
according to carefully devised rules, gives cer- 
tainty and uniformity of result, and much 
greater usefulness. Libraries of all classes 
have taken part in making these great improve- 
ments and have shared in their benefits. 

Along with this development of method has 
come another still more important change, 
that from a comparatively passive condition to 
one of great activity. The older librarian was 
well content to wait for people to come to him. 
The modern librarian attracts people to the 
library, or sends it to them. The older libra- 
rian thought the full measure of his duty con- 
sisted in taking care of the library, opening it 
at certain hours, and permitting people to use 
it, as well as they were able, under regulations 
which were often serious restrictions. The 
whole tendency has been toward greater free- 
dom, and attractiveness, and usefulness for the 
largest possible number. 

In college libraries this tendency has shown 
itself in less rigid rules, longer hours of open- 
ing, extending the use of the library to others 
than their own students, and in the introduc- 
tion of the seminar. 

In public libraries the hours have been .in- 
creased to suit the convenience of readers ; the 
age limit for children has been lowered or en- 
tirely removed, and much is done in other 
ways to make the library useful to the young. 
Special rooms for children, both for reading 
and for the issue of books, are an essential 
part of our modern equipment. Children's 
needs and tastes are studied, and special col- 
lections of books and reading lists prepared for 
them. Bulletin boards, with pictures, and read- 
ing lists upon the various holidays, and other 
timely topics are posted. Children's Library 
Leagues for promoting the care for and read- 
ing of good books, are organized in many 
cities. Close relations are maintained with the 
schools. The librarian is informed as to the 
courses of study, and part of the buying is di- 
rected to meet the needs of both teacher and 
pupil, for collateral reading. Books are issued 
both from the library direct and from deposits 



in the school buildings. The library also sup- 
plies the needs of the various clubs for literary 
work. 

Another important change has been in the 
direction of allowing greater freedom of access 
to the shelves of the circulating departments 
of our larger libraries. Formerly these were 
scrupulously closed off from the public rooms, 
and it was necessary to select from a catalogue 
and wait for the book to be brought by an at- 
tendant, as is, unfortunately, still the practice in 
a majority of our large libraries. In a few, 
however, of the largest and most successful 
city libraries, the shelves of the circulating 
departments have been thrown open with the 
greatest freedom to all borrowers and readers, 
with the most favorable results. The increased 
value of a library conducted on this plan can- 
not be estimated. Twenty years ago the sug- 
gestion that the shelves of a large city library 
might be thrown open to all users, would have 
been regarded as visionary, impracticable, and 
altogether undesirable. Now it is generally 
accepted by librarians as a desirable thing, and 
with proper building arrangements, and with 
certain obvious exceptions, is regarded as en- 
tirely feasible. I have spoken in this of the 
circulating departments especially, as greater 
freedom is generally permitted in the reference 
departments. The work of subscription and 
proprietary libraries has shared some of the 
changes noted above. It has occurred in many 
instances that a subscription library has been 
changed into a free library. 

Another important extension of the work has 
been in the establishment of branches and sta- 
tions in our cities and larger towns. The 
reason for this is obviously the same as that 
which dots our cities with school-houses. It is 
as impossible for people from all sections of a 
great city to get any adequate supply of books 
from one main library, as it would be for them 
to send their children all to one school ; hence, 
the necessity for the branch or station. It is 
a positive injustice to tax a whole city for 
library purposes, without providing reasonably 
equal facilities for its different sections. 

Another important phase of library exten- 
sion is the work of library commissions in giv- 
ing advice and active help to libraries already 
established, or by lending travelling libraries, 
which meet an immediate need in some special 
neighborhood, and often lead to the establish- 
ment of permanent libraries. 

If I have dwelt principally in the forego- 
ing on public library work, it is because that 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



349 



seems to be so broad as to include in some of 
its phases, if the work is thoroughly done and 
all its possibilities understood, all library 
work. The librarian of the village, of the 
university, and of the city, despite the differ- 
ence of circumstance, have recognized the 
essential unity of their work ; and it is this 
recognition which has rendered possible that 
cordial cooperation among all librarians that 
has brought about th.e improvements in meth- 
ods, and the enlargement and success of the 
work. 

Let us sum up briefly the results of the past 
twenty years. During that period libraries 
have much more than doubled in volume, that 
is, they have made a larger growth than in all 
the previous years of their history. All of the 
greater library buildings in the country have 
been built within that time. The income for 
library purposes has greatly increased. The 
most valuable laws providing for library exten- 
sion have been passed within that time. A 
great share of all the large library donations 
have been made within that time, and a large 
proportion within a very few years. While it 
has been a period of growth it has been just as 
definitely a period of organization, a period in 
which systems have been devised, and stand- 
ards fixed. 

We have thus far dealt with the material 
and systematic phases of library growth, but 
even more important is it to inquire what has 
been the spirit and tendency of the work, what 
is its value and significance in the life of to-day, 
and what are its possibilities. 

The practical reason for the maintenance of 
libraries is the same as that for schools, namely, 
the necessity of education for a self-governing 
people. Libraries, like schools, are educational 
institutions, whose work tends to make better 
citizens. This is the only sufficient reason for 
their public support, the only strong attraction 
for private beneficence. They do this by fur- 
nishing books which give practical instruction 
in the arts of life, which inform as to civic 
duties, which appeal to the emotions and feed 
the intellectual and spiritual nature. They are 
broader than the schools in this scope, as they 
begin with the children, go with them through 
school and college, and give them the oppor- 
tunity to carry their education through life. 
The underlying motive, the compelling force, 
which has induced this open-handed expendi- 
ture of money, this intelligent and faithful 
work, is a generous free spirit, ever seeking to 
enlarge the area of freedom and enlightenment, 



earnest, active, and aggressive, with the kindly 
aggressiveness of the missionary. 

Within the past twenty years, libraries have 
come to fill a much larger place in our social 
life in many ways. The location of the new 
library of Columbia, as the centre of the group 
of university buildings, is significant of the 
place the college library is coming to occupy 
as the centre of college life and activity. So 
the public library should, and I believe will, 
become the centre of the intellectual life of the 
city, the common meeting-ground, the store- 
house and study for all who are active for the 
welfare of the city in any of its various inter- 
ests. It will furnish rooms for scientific and 
literary societies and study clubs, and will give 
facilities for all educational work not provided 
for by the regular schools with which it will 
work in close harmony. The 'great growth of 
libraries during the past two decades has been 
a rapidly accelerating one, greater in the past 
few years than ever before. If this continues, 
the growth of the first twenty years of the 
next century will be much greater than the past. 
This will mean grander opportunities, more 
weighty responsibilities. As the success of the 
past has clearly been due to the cooperation of 
librarians with each other, so the greater work 
of the library in the future may be done by 
bringing about a broader cooperation. In ad- 
dition to its own direct work for education, may 
it not offer a common meeting-ground, and 
bring about a closer cooperation of all the 
forces which make for the betterment of social 
conditions, for higher civilization ?

AMERICAN PERIODICALS. 



When one is asked, as I have been, to write 
of periodical literature, and especially about 
American periodicals of the twenty years dur- 
ing which THE DIAL has existed, one has a 
vision of a multitudinous swarm buzzing out 
from the press rooms. Some of them are 
ephemera and some come to stay with us. 
There are glimpses of illustrations, rude and 
good ; pen and ink drawings of lay figures 
which seem to have been cut out with the jag- 
gedest blade of an old jack-knife ; wash draw- 
ings of merit and demerit, occasionally leering 
towards the realm of Anthony Comstock ; 
much red, yellow, blue, and green ; and occa- 
sionally nothing but letterpress. So many 
have come and gone! A list of them would 



350 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



make dreary reading unless it could be accom- 
panied by the secret history of some of the 
failures, in which event it might be amusing 
although it would of tener be pathetic ; for al- 
most all these efforts are sincere and many of 
them worthy endeavors to command success. 
Most of them, it is true, seek simply the mys- 
terious pathway to the public's pocket. Their 
founders and conductors are ready to do any- 
thing to gratify what they think is the public 
taste, or lack of taste. They will flash upon 
the ignorant eye in color vivid enough to de- 
stroy a very fine optic nerve, or they will con- 
duct youth behind the scenes whither the vul- 
gar young are always ready, perhaps eager, to 
be led. Clever men will prostitute their tal- 
ents, and seemingly respectable men will sell 
their consciences and principles in order to 
find that mazy pathway. It seems to be the 
faith of the second-rates that large and profit- 
able circulations must be gained by spicing 
torpid minds into activity the pleasure of 
any emotion or of anything like an intellectual 
sensation being so unusual, and therefore so 
attractive, to large numbers of the community 
that they are willing to pay many small sums 
for it. The public is a good deal above these 
second-rates, however, as we shall see in our 
brief progress. It may be true enough that 
the largest circulations are gained by intellec- 
tual pandering, but it does not follow that 
pandering is the most profitable form of edi- 
torial, or even of publishing, activity. There 
are vulgar periodicals, and books, too, in- 
deed there is no monopoly of vulgarity and ig- 
norance in the realms of literature, that have 
a basis, or a grain, of sound sense or of useful- 
ness like a column of useful household sug- 
gestions, or an occasional intelligent opinion, 
and perhaps the makers of these would be as- 
tonished to know how large a part of the popu- 
larity of their product is due to its utility or 
its integrity. It is not true, of course, that all 
who are earning the wages of debasement 
whether the degradation be ethical or aesthetic 
are thereby selling intellects or consciences. 
There are some who are just dull, and these 
occasionally are moved by the environment of 
respectability into which they have been born, 
or married, to endeavor to be important. They 
produce for their social atmosphere, as the 
vulgarians produce for theirs, and with the 
same unconsciousness of the existence of any 
region of mental or moral activity outside of 
that of their own vestry room, or debating 
club, or sewing circle. Their editorial per- 



formance is imparted by the spirit of the vicin- 
age, like their religious observances, their 
serious church-going faces and walking sticks. 
Think as they may about it, however, their 
conduct is not nearly so respectable as that of 
the sixteenth century Italian cynics who used 
to thrust their tongues into their cheeks of 
Sunday mornings and remark to one another : 
" Come, let us conform to the popular error! " 
But what ineffable attainder of wrong and in- 
jury has their dull efforts worked ! From how 
many promising minds has the light been ex- 
cluded because of the repulsive dullness of 
their attempted importance ! 

Having uttered this by way of notice of the 
vulgar ephemera, and other commercial de- 
signs upon the public pocket, I shall proceed 
to say what I think is the prevailing evidence 
of these twenty years as to the tendency of 
periodical literature. It is difficult to com- 
press a large collection of facts into a short 
definition, and I cannot enter into critical com- 
parisons for fear that lack of space may lead 
not only to seeming but to real injustices. The 
obvious fact, however, in the history of peri- 
odicals of the last twenty years, is that there is 
in this country an increasing demand for sound 
information and discussion on literature, art, 
the bewildering achievements of modern sci- 
ence, and on public questions. 

The story magazine we know. It existed 
before 1880 ; and the story-telling weekly ex- 
isted then, too, but as it was then it has largely 
gone. Perhaps it is because the ten-cent maga- 
zines give so much more for so much less that 
the " New York Ledger " has become a month- 
ly, while some of its old-time associates are 
not making so much noise as we once heard 
from them. There are better stories now than 
we used to have, and the new romancers, who 
write on history instead of hasheesh, are not 
only more improving, but are much more en- 
tertaining. The weekly story paper must be 
still in demand, however strongly convinced 
Mr. Bonner was that the seventh day periodi- 
cal had outlived its time, for we have the 
"Saturday Evening Post," of Philadelphia, 
and it is flourishing. This change in the 
weekly field is also due to the appearance of 
the Sunday illustrated annex to the daily news- 
paper. It is ambitiously dubbed a Sunday 
magazine and it is, in most cases, a veritable 
magazine of explosives, dimly related to art 
and letters, and possessing some of the noxious 
effects of lyddite, if one may compare imma- 
terial to material stenches. There are some 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



\ 



351 



illustrated supplements, it is true, not open to 
the lyddite charge. They have been made 
possible by the development of the cheap pro- 
cesses by means of which photography has be- 
come so essentially the basis of modern illus- 
trative work. Cheap paper and cheap pictures 
are the causes of these weekly efforts on the 
part of the daily press, and there is little com- 
plaint to be made of some of them. When 
the " color schemes " of some of the Sunday 
spectacles are worked out, perhaps they will 
all be tolerable. For one thing we shall have 
eventually to thank them ; they will greatly 
advance the art of making the illustrated 
weeklies like "Harper's," "Collier's," and 
"Leslie's." These papers must go back to 
the artist, and some of them are already show- 
ing evidence that they recognize the fact that 
they can compete with the illustrated supple- 
ments only in quality. 

It is not, however, in these periodical pre- 
sentations of the arts that please the eye and 
the fancy, that the interesting movement in 
periodical literature has taken place. When 
THE DIAL was born, the New York " Nation " 
was easily the first among the weekly papers of 
the country, easily first in its knowledge of its 
subjects, in the great ability with which it dis- 
cussed the political, social, economic, literary, 
and artistic questions of the time. Nothing so 
thorough or so clever as its book reviews had 
been regularly published in this country. Here 
was a journal of which we could all be proud, 
even in our wrath, and even when we rejoiced 
in discovering that it was not infallible. It be- 
came the fashion. People who liked good read- 
ing on important subjects took it and enjoyed 
it, and people who liked to be in the intellect- 
ual fashion cut its leaves and had it on the 
centre table. Therefore it paid dividends, and 
became an inspiration and example to editors 
and publishers who had not otherwise attained 
to a comprehension of the richness of the in- 
tellectual mine. The " Nation " exists to-day, 
and is as interesting as it would be had it still 
a separate and an independent life, but, unfor- 
tunately for its urban influence at least, it is 
largely a re-print of the " New York Evening 
Post," so that the feast it has to offer is in the 
nature of a rechauffee. 

The " Nation's " influence has been of sur- 
prising value, and it supplements the wonder- 
fully increased activity of the universities and 
colleges. When we reflect that there now come 
about as many graduates each year from these 
institutions as there used to be undergraduates 



in all four classes thirty years ago, we ought 
readily to understand why so many periodicals 
are seeing and realizing the advantage of en- 
deavoring to attract the friendship and support 
of minds that do not need spice to arouse them 
into action. There is now an encouraging rec- 
ognition of the public's demand for intelligent 
presentation of the important facts and ques- 
tions of the world's current history. It shows 
that editors and publishers are not really very 
far behind the educated public, as well as that 
the educated public is increasing in numbers 
and exactions. Within the twenty years, the 
old and new monthlies, the " Century," " Har- 
per's," " Scribner's," the Atlantic," the " Cos- 
mopolitan," and " McClure's," have been con- 
sidering subjects which are topics of the daily 
press, and which are important. But this reach- 
ing out after subjects that, in the horrible and 
horrifying modern English, are called "newsy," 
is best shown by some of the important of the re- 
ligious weeklies, like the " Independent," the 
" Outlook," and the " Churchman." Doubtless 
there is quite as much of essential piety in 
these papers as when they were almost exclu- 
sively conveyers of church news and theological 
speculation. There is distinctly less of sermon- 
izing in them and much less of spiritual theor- 
izing. The truth is recognized that a large 
number of good people want to know what is 
going on in the world that is of real interest 
and real importance. Some of them live be- 
yond the boundaries of the daily paper. Some 
do not like the confusion of the large daily, or 
its idea of the relative importance of crime and 
lechery to the really momentous achievements 
and questionings of men. They like the clear 
statement and sound perspective of the events 
of the week, which they find in these weekly 
papers, and they like also clear and well-con- 
sidered discussion. 

There is no doubt that the periodical litera- 
ture of the country has greatly increased in im- 
portance, and what we call weight, in the last 
twenty years, and that the tendency is towards 
still greater importance. The growth in liter- 
ary and scientific periodical literature is clear 
evidence of this. Now we have THE DIAL it- 
self, of which I must speak, however much I 
may dislike to flatter it to its very face, but its 
successful existence, in a field little known in 
the East, hardly known at all twenty years ago, 
is a revelation, a most gratifying revelation, 
of the profit awaiting those who are willing 
and capable of doing serious work for the edi- 
fication of people who know books, and who 



352 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



want to read intelligent discussion and clear 
thinking on topics that are worth while that 
give pleasure and mental and moral stimulation 
to rational beings. In New York we have the 
" Critic," the " Book Buyer," and the " Book- 
man," and the Saturday supplement of the 
" Times," giving us news and gossip of liter- 
ary men and women and criticism of what they 
have done. And in different paths than that 
of pure literature and science, in the plastic 
arts, in painting, in architecture, in economics, 
we have a periodical literature that 1 venture 
to say could not have found needed sustenance 
in the days of more than twenty years ago. 
The spirit of the times, so far as periodical lit- 
erature is concerned, seems to me to be repre- 
sented by the " Review of Reviews," which 
stands for something more than the " quick- 
lunch-for-busy-men " principle, although that 
feature of it is of sound material, the best that 
the markets, domestic and foreign, afford. We 
have a whole host of magazines and weeklies 
informing and teaching us as to special and 
general interests like the " Political Science 
Quarterly," " Journal of Economics," " Popu- 
lar Science Monthly," "Science," the "Forum," 
the revivified "North American Review," 
" Good Government," and the " International 
Monthly." The very existence of these, the 
success of many of them, show that the tend- 
ency of periodical literature in our day is to- 
wards the satisfaction of a distinctly higher 
and finer standard than was dreamed of by 
most of the magazines and weeklies of twenty 
years ago. Perhaps if any subjects are demand- 
ing more attention than others, they are those 
of political administration, of good government, 
of municipal socialism, and of economics as 
they relate to social and individual prosperity 
and comfort. Notwithstanding the gains of the 
literary periodicals, the marked growth has 
been in the literature of practical subjects, and 
this is in harmony with the national character. 
Periodical literature is taking a livelier and 
more intelligent interest in the larger affairs of 
life, and the history of the last twenty years 
points to a much finer growth for the future, to 
a notable development of the journals and mag- 
azines not wholly devoted to practical ques- 
tions, to more and higher literary and art crit- 
icism, and to perhaps richer expressions of 
idealism. All of which is full of instruction to 
the publishers who act on the principle that 
only the vulgar or the stupid commonplace 
" go " with the American public.

AMERICAN EDUCATION. 



The years 1880 and 1900 have no especial 
educational significance, except that 1900 
rounds out the century, and so furnishes a fit- 
ting opportunity to review past history, to 
summarize results, to take an account of the 
present situation, and to forecast the future, 
while 1880, of course, we take as a starting 
point in order to see what progress has been 
made during THE DIAL'S twenty years. We 
do not propose, however, to take advantage of 
this opportunity in any particular sense, but 
shall use the dates merely as labels, marking 
two cross sections of the general educational 
movement of the country that are sufficiently 
far apart to present data for instructive compar- 
ison. We shall begin with the public schools. 

1879-80. 1897-98. 

Total population 50,155,783 72,737,100 

Number of persons 5 to 18 years of 

age 15,065,767 21,458,294 

Number of different pupils enrolled 

in schools 9,867,505 15,038,636 

Per cent of population enrolled . 19.67 20.68 
Per cent of persons 5-18 years of 

age enrolled 65.50 70.08 

Average daily attendance . . . 6,144,143 10,286,092 

Ratio of same to enrollment . . 62.3 68.4 

Average length of school, in days . 130.3 143.1 
Average number of days attended 

for each person, 5 to 18 years 

of age 53.1 68.6 

Average number for each pupil 

enrolled 81.1 97.8 

Whole number of teachers . . . 286,593 409,193 

Number of schoolhouses .... 178,222 242,390 

Value of school property .... $209,571,718 $492,703,781 

Total receipts 134,194,806 199,317,397 

Total expenditures 140,506,715 194,020,470 

Average expenditures per capita of 

population 1.56 2.67 

Average expenditure per pupil, in 

average attendance .... 12.71 18.86 

Statistical tables are considered forbidding 
reading, but such a table as the foregoing is, 
nevertheless, the most effective way in which 
to present a comparative view like this. While 
the figures, for the most part, tell their own 
story, two or three brief remarks may serve a 
useful purpose. 

It will be seen at once that the cross-sections 
are not twenty years, but only eighteen years, 
apart. Unfortunately for our purpose, the sta- 
tistics for the current year will not be available 
until sometime late in 1901, or possibly until 
1902. But if we assume that the gains of 
1898-1900 equal those of 1896-98, which is 
certainly a reasonable assumption, we shall 
close the century with 244,700. schoolhouses and 
418,000 teachers; 15,700,000 pupils enrolled 
in the schools and an average daily attendance 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



353 



of 10,825,000 ; an annual school income of 
1206,230,000 and an expenditure of $203,- 
587,000. The total common school expendi- 
ture of the country is now increasing at the 
rate of about $5,000,000 a year. 

Dangerous fallacies lurk in comparative sta- 
tistics unless great care is taken in selecting 
and combining them. Undoubtedly our edu- 
cational statistics have improved in quality since 
1880, and this improvement has tended in one 
way to increase and in another way to diminish 
the aggregates. On the whole, however, there is 
no reason to think that the comparison presented 
in the table is not a fair one. Moreover, the 
improved methods of collecting and sifting 
statistics are one of the improvements that have 
been made in educational science. 

The tests usually applied to such tables as 
the above show that the minor movements 
within the whole movement are in the right 
direction. The per cents of persons between 
5 and 18 years of age enrolled in the schools, 
the ratio of average daily attendance to such 
enrollment, the average length of the school 
year, the average number of days attendance 
for each person between the ages of 5 and 
18, the average amount of schooling received 
per pupil, and the school expenditures per 
capita for both the total population and the 
average number of pupils attending, all show 
a healthy increase. The facts point to the 
increasing wealth of the country, and to an en- 
hanced interest in education. The Commis- 
sioner of Education points out the fact that 
the gratifying " increase in the length of the 
school year keeps pace with the growth of large 
villages and cities." " Urban populations," he 
says, " have a school session of nine or ten 
months, while rural districts have three or four 
months, or at the highest six months. But this 
view must not be pressed to the point of assum- 
ing that rural communities have not length- 
ened their terms of school. For example, the 
school term grew in North Carolina 19, South 
Carolina 13, Georgia 42, Tennessee 22, Louis- 
iana 15, Texas 19, days in the year. The 
amount of schooling furnished in these States 
as measured by the length of the term is still 
painfully small ; but perhaps as much progress 
has been made as could reasonably have been 
expected. Equal gains were not to be looked 
for in the old States of the North, as their 
school terms were already well extended. In 
another respect the South shows to advantage 
in comparison with the North. The per cents 
of population from 5 to 18 years of age in- 



creased in all the South Atlantic and South 
Central States, in Arkansas considerably more 
than doubling ; while in the North Atlantic 
and North Central States such per cents actu- 
ally fell off in many cases, and in none did 
much more than to hold their own. That con- 
siderable gains were not made is intelligible 
enough ; but that a loss noticeable in degree 
should occur in such a State as Massachusetts 
has never been adequately explained. Perhaps 
it is due in part to the very improvement of 
the schools an increasing number of the 
children obtaining their elementary education 
at an earlier age than before. When we pass 
to the average expenditure per capita of the 
population, and of the pupil, based on the 
average daily attendance, the comparison is 
not so reassuring. It is true that many States 
of the Old South more than doubled such ex- 
penditures, but so did many States at the 
North. Possibly an advance from 27 cents to 
53 cents per capita of the population in North 
Carolina, or from 31 to 84 cents in Georgia, 
all things considered, is as significant as an 
advance from $2.80 to $5.07 in Massachusetts, 
or from $1.90 to $4.12 in Rhode Island ; but 
the large ratio is overlooked in the small terms. 
In 1880 the school expenditure per capita of 
school population of the sixteen former Slave 
States and the District of Columbia approxi- 
mately classified by races was, white $2,76, 
colored $1.09. In 1898 the same averages 
were $4.01 and $2.34. 

One of the promising movements of the 
times is the concentration of rural schools in 
sparsely populated districts at central points, 
such as elegible villages, which has been going 
on in some of the old States, whereby the 
peculiar advantages of the urban graded school 
are secured for country children; but this 
movement has not assumed proportions that 
sensibly affect the average length of the school 
year, or the attendance per cent. The com- 
parative merits of the township and the district 
types of school organization have been under 
discussion throughout the period, with a steady 
inclination of the argument to the former ; but 
the practical progress that has been made in 
this direction has by no means been commen- 
surate with the discussion. 

The opinion that our methods of school ad- 
ministration need to be radically changed, at 
least in cities of considerable size, has gone 
abroad very widely. The large school board 
that does a great amount of the executive 
work which a school system requires through 



354 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



its own standing committees, has fallen into 
much disfavor, and even contempt, and the 
small board with limited powers acting through 
expert executive officers is strongly preferred 
by the most competent judges. In several 
cities, as New Haven, Cleveland, Cincinnati, 
Toledo, St. Louis, and Milwaukee, the new 
ideas, in whole or part, have been enacted into 
law, and are now undergoing the test of expe- 
rience. In other cities, as Boston, Detroit, and 
Chicago, strenuous efforts have not, so far, been 
able to effect the desired reform. 

It is much easier to deal with education ob- 
jectively than subjectively ; and it is never easy 
to extract from statistics their moral signifi- 
cance. Still, undoubted progress has been made 
in the subjective elements, if not as much as 
in the objective ones. The average course of 
elementary study has been somewhat changed 
for the better, and methods of teaching some- 
what improved. Instruction has been made 
less verbal and more real, as is shown by the 
extension or introduction of nature studies and 
manual training. Less stress is laid upon for- 
mal Grammar and Arithmetic than formerly, 
and more time is found for language-lessons, 
literature, and history. Teachers are slowly 
emancipating themselves from the old slavery 
to the text-book, and are gaining larger con- 
trol of their own minds. To sum up the total 
effect so far of child-study upon the schools 
would be an impossible task. Something we 
may carry to the credit of the movement. 
Moreover, when child-study has exchanged its 
high " scientific " methods for common sense, 
and has ceased to be a fad, it will contribute 
materially to our culture, but far more as a 
method reacting upon the minds of teachers 
than as a body of definitely ascertained acts or 
a system of doctrine. 

Slow changes have been going on in the 
teaching force. At the earlier period, 42.8 per 
cent, of the public school teachers were men ; 
at the later period only 32.2. Women teach- 
ers have been steadily gaining ground in parts 
of the country where they were not formerly 
held in high esteem, as in the Southern States. 
Mixed consequences flow from the change. In 
some communities the employment of more 
women means higher culture and better char- 
acter in the teaching force ; in other commu- 
nities, it means a distinct loss of power in the 
schoolroom. Something depends upon the rela- 
tive number of men and women found in the 
schools, as well as upon the educational and per- 
sonal qualifications of candidates applying for 



teachers' positions. When the average per cent, 
of men teachers in any State falls below 20, it 
is time to remember that men as well as women 
are needed in fair proportion in the schools. 

The evidence that the preparation of com- 
mon school teachers is improving, is convinc- 
ing. Dr. Harris has shown that from 1880 to 
1897 the enrollment in public normal schools 
increased from about 10,000 to over 40,000, 
or fourfold, and in private normal schools from 
2,000 to 24,000, or twelvefold. At the first 
date there were 240 normal students in every 
million of our population ; in 1897 there were 
976 in every million. In the same period the 
total number of teachers increased from 280,- 
094 to 403,333, or 44 per cent. 

Something has been done to improve the 
teachers' tenure of office. In Cincinnati, for 
instance, after the teacher has passed a suitable 
novitiate he is elected for good behavior. The 
average term of service in a particular school, 
and the average period of service, are both 
lengthening. A number of cities have taken 
measures to establish teachers' pension funds ; 
but unfortunately these measures have some- 
times been taken so clumsily that there is reason 
to fear that the school authorities will be obliged 
to go backward before they can go forward. 

It was not until ten years ago that the Bu- 
reau of Education attempted to obtain returns 
from high schools that were outside of cities. 
In 1890 only 2,526 such schools, with 202,963 
pupils enrolled, reported ; in 1898 the number 
had increased to 5,315 schools, with 459,813 
pupils. Well may the Commissioner call this 
increase " phenomenal." Still, the number of 
pupils he holds to be somewhat too small, as 
there are many secondary pupils outside the 
completely organized high schools whom there 
are no means of reaching. Still more, 1990 
private schools high schools, academies, pre- 
paratory schools, etc. furnished instruction 
to 166,302 pupils. The grand totals are, 
therefore, 7,305 secondary schools reporting 
and 626,111 pupils. Or if we add the sup- 
posed pupils in public schools not reported, we 
have a total of 650,000. Students in commer- 
cial schools still remain outside the list. The 
secondary pupils were 3.75 per cent, of the 
aggregate enrollment in schools of all kinds, 
not mentioning the miscellaneous schools to be 
named farther on. 

In the high schools we meet an intimation 
of one of the most significant facts in our re- 
cent history, viz., the increasing number of 
women who are seeking the higher education. 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



355 



The pupils enrolled in the public schools, high 
schools included, were thus divided between 
the two sexes : males, 7,643,496 ; females, 
7,395,514. But in the public high schools 
alone the division was : males, 189,188, 
females, 260,413 ; while in all the schools re- 
porting secondary pupils, there were 284,379 
males to 341,736 females. 

The various secondary schools graduated 
65,170 pupils, or nearly 12 per cent, of the 
total number enrolled. The pupils who were 
preparing for college were 77,559, or about 14 
per cent, of the total number. But of the 
graduates, 19,940, or nearly 31 per cent., had 
prepared for college. Confining the view to 
the public high schools, about 10 per cent, of 
the males and 12 per cent, of the females grad- 
uated, or 19,247 of the one sex, and 33,775 of 
the other ; while 13.5 per cent, of the males 
and 9.75 per cent, of the girls, or 25,627 and 
25,425, respectively, were preparing for col- 
lege. Again, of the graduates the correspond- 
ing per cents were 34.8 and 23.25, and the 
corresponding numbers 6,699 and 7,853. It 
is significant that while the total number of 
students preparing in public higher schools for 
college is all the time increasing, the propor- 
tion of such students to the total number 
taught in such schools is all the time falling 
off. In 1890 the latter per cent, was 14.44 ; 
in 1898 it had fallen to 11.36. These per 
cents, taken in connection with other facts, 
show conclusively that for eight years, at least, 
secondary education grew much more rapidly 
than higher education. And yet higher educa- 
tion made a remarkable growth, as we shall 
soon show. 

The last observation calls up the twin func- 
tions of American high schools to fit one 
class of students for active life and another 
class for college. These schools are undoubt- 
edly growing more rapidly in the one direc- 
tion than in the other. They are emphasizing 
the people's college idea more than the fitting 
school idea. This fact is somewhat accentuat- 
ing the old difficulty of so constituting courses 
of study as to make them answer, or well 
answer, both purposes. This problem, along 
with other related problems, has engaged the 
earnest attention of some of our ablest educa- 
tors. The Committee of Ten on Secondary 
Education and the Committee on College 
Entrance Requirements have both grappled 
with important phases of the general subject, 
and with good results. In these discussions, 
the purely secondary school view, or high 



school view, has received the recognition that 
it never received before. Hitherto secondary 
teachers have been an un influential body com- 
pared with secondary teachers in the leading 
countries of Europe ; they are still, no doubt, 
inferior to them in this particular ; but they 
are now becoming a strong, as well as a 
numerous, host. College professors should at 
once face the fact, if they have not already 
done so, that college entrance requirements 
will exert much less influence upon secondary 
schools in the future than in the past. 

The relative number of students in colleges 
at different times, compared with the whole 
population, has fluctuated very considerably. 
In 1870 President Barnard, of Columbia Col- 
lege, showed that the ratio of New England 
alone at four different periods was as follows : 
1826, 1 to 1,513 ; 1838, 1 to 1,294 ; 1855, 1 
to 1,689 ; 1869, 1 to 1,927. 

From 1838 to 1869, while the college ratio 
was falling off, the population of New England 
increased more that 50 per cent. A similar 
declension, Dr. Barnard claims, had taken 
place all over the country, and his analysis of 
the New York statistics sustains the claim with 
respect to that State. These conclusions have 
never been impeached. Fortunately, however, 
things soon took a turn for the better. The 
Commissioner of Education, in his last Re- 
port, printed a table showing that the num- 
ber of students to a million of the popula- 
tion increased as follows from 1872 to 1898 : 
Undergraduate, collegiate, and technical stu- 
dents, from 573 to 1,193 ; graduate students, 
from 5 to 74 ; law students, from 49 to 163 ; 
medical students, from 142 to 328 ; theo- 
logical students, from 83 to 117. The total 
increase was from 852 to 1,875. 

It is not easy to discover all the causes that 
enter into such changes as the fluctuations in 
relative college attendance present to our view. 
Dr. Barnard was convinced that the general 
adherence of colleges to the old rigid course of 
study had much to do with the losses from 
1838 to 1869. The traditionary type of col- 
lege education had ceased to meet, he con- 
tended, the demands of American society ; and 
he found proof of his statements in the growth 
of institutions where modern studies received 
more encouragement and where a liberal elec- 
tion of studies was allowed. He pointed to 
Harvard and Cornell Universities and the 
University of Michigan to enforce his argu- 
ments. Were Dr. Barnard still living, he 
would no doubt find a clear demonstration of 



356 



THE DIAL, 



[May 1, 



his view in the later developments, and he 
would apparently have a perfect right to do 
so. It is certainly a significant fact that the 
recent extraordinary growth of the number of 
students attending the higher schools has ac- 
companied, or followed hard upon, the general 
modification of the old college curriculum with 
respect to range of studies, composition of 
courses, freedom of elections, and the relaxa- 
tion of other requirements. 

The total amount of money invested in uni- 
versities and colleges and schools of technology 
in 1898 was $311,842,000. The benefactions 
for the year were $8,204,000. All told, there 
were 144,477 students enrolled in the higher 
institutions, including professional schools 
108,695 men and 35,782 women. In the five 
great sections of the Union the ratios of popu- 
lation to a college student were as follows : 
North Atlantic States, 714 ; South Atlantic 
States, 1,030 ; South Central States, 1,237 ; 
North Central States, 716 ; Western States, 532. 

The most striking fact that appears in the 
college statistics of the period is the prodigious 
growth of the strong, and especially of the 
great, institutions. Trinity College and Wes- 
leyan University, Conn., together increased 
their students from 264 to 409. Yale College 
increased hers from 687 to 1,724. Amherst 
College grew from 339 to 369 ; Williams Col- 
lege from 227 to 359 ; Harvard College from 
886 to 2,240. Brown University advanced 
from 247 to 759. The stronger State univer- 
sities of the West made similar gains. The 
University of Michigan leaped from 521 to 
1,534 in eighteen years ; its three leading com- 
petitors, if we may trust the tables, actually 
fell from 395 to 343. Indiana University in- 
creased four-fold, the University of Wisconsin 
three-fold. These statistics, it should be re- 
marked, include proper college students only. 

The meaning of the facts just presented is 
easily read. They show the great advantage 
that the strong institutions have in prestige, 
strong faculties, and abundant resources, over 
the small ones. What will the end be ? is a 
question which many of the smaller colleges 
and universities are now asking themselves 
with some misgivings as to the answer. 

Full and accurate statistics of attendance 
upon private schools are hard 'to obtain, except 
in the well educated and highly policed states 
of Europe. In 1898 the Commissioner re- 
ported 1,554,725 pupils enrolled in private 
and incorporated schools of all kinds, to 15,- 
132,918 in public schools and institutions. 



Estimation, however, played a great part in 
the first of these results. The ratio of the one 
number to the other is a little more than 9 to 
100, while the Commissioner holds 15 to 100 
to be the normal standard of the country. In 
1898 the relative attendance upon private 
schools had already begun to increase, and 
since that year it has no doubt made consider- 
able progress toward the normal standard. All 
things considered, the prosperity of the pri- 
vate schools of the country is perhaps the best 
educational criterion that we have of the busi- 
ness state of the country. Besides the pupils and 
students now enumerated, the Commissioner 
found 485,292 other pupils attending schools 
of a miscellaneous character that cannot be 
described. Adding this number to the pre- 
ceding number, we have a grand total of 17,- 
172,935 persons enrolled in schools of some 
kind at some time during the year. The ratio 
to the estimated population was practically 17 
to 72, or 1 to 4. 

Such are a few of the many interesting 
phases that American education presents for 
the last twenty years. Perhaps they have not 
all been wisely preferred to others which could 
readily be made. Perhaps disproportionate 
stress has been placed upon external and quan- 
titative features, as we Americans are some- 
times charged with doing. The writer denies, 
however, most emphatically, that he is forget- 
ful of the object of education, and guards him- 
self against possible misapprehension with the 
further remark that great progress has un- 
doubtedly been made in subjective or qualita- 
tive elements. Defects in our national educa- 
tion are both numerous and serious ; but, upon 
the whole, the showing for twenty years is dis- 
tinctly encouraging. 

At the close, a word may well be given to 
the growth of educational associations and 
societies of one sort and another. The growth 
of many of these bodies in numbers and influ- 
ence is among the greatest surprises of the 
period. For example, an attendance of 10,000 
members contributing to the treasury upon an 
annual meeting of the National Educational 
Association, is not now at all unusual. What is 
more to the purpose, however, is the contribu- 
tion to real educational progress that this asso- 
ciation has made through its discussions and 
published proceedings, and especially through 
the very useful series of reports embodying 
the results of special investigations that it has 
conducted through its committees.

TRIBUTES FROM OUR FRIENDS. 



The announcement of the completion of THE 
DIAL'S twentieth year, and of its anniversary 
number, has brought from friends of the paper 
in all parts of the country, and in England, 
many delightful words of congratulation, and 
it is a sincere pleasure to the Editors and Pub- 
lishers to present some of these herewith. 

THE DIAL has uniformly directed its energies to 
the work of upholding the best standards of liter- 
ary criticism in this country. It has done this with 
dignity, courage, and strength; and it has added 
modernity of its own. There is much to be thank- 
ful for in the fact that such a publication has had 
so long and so prosperous a life, and that it 
should now seem to be but entering upon its youth. 

JAMES LANE ALLEN. 
New York, April 8. 



It affords me genuine pleasure to be able to con- 
gratulate the editors and publishers of THE DIAL 
on the completion of the twentieth year of publica- 
tion. I have been a constant reader during these 
memorable twenty years, and have noted with great 
satisfaction the success of THE DIAL as a factor in 
American literature. May it continue to maintain 
the same high ideal as in the past, and remain a 
power for good long after its editor and contributors 
of twenty years ago shall have laid away their pens 

forever. 

RASMUS B. ANDERSON. 

Madison, Wis., March 29. 



I am glad to join in the chorus which must by 
this time be swelling in your ears, on THE DIAL'S 
having entered upon the year of its majority. For 
a journal of criticism, having such a high standard 
of excellence as THE DIAL, to have lived for twenty 
years among a hurried and nervous people, too busy 
most of them to give to it the tbougbtf ul considera- 
tion which it merits and which it really needs in 
order that its value may be demonstrated, is in it- 
itself an achievement. I congratulate not only 
yourselves in having so successfully lived up to 
your ideals, but the American people as well for 
having had the good taste to like you and your 
ways sufficiently to make your twentieth anniver- 
sary possible. May THE DIAL wax fat and pros- 
perous, and some day be found celebrating its five 
times twentieth anniversary. 

JOHN KENDRICK BANGS. 

New York, April 4- 



I congratulate you on this your twentieth anni- 
versary. THE DIAL represents to me much the 
best periodical of its class in this country, and I 
wish you for the future every success.

New York, April 7. 



I tender to you my congratulations on your 
twentieth birthday. May you live a thousand years ! 
If you have a bric-a-brac corner for nonsense verses 
in your anniversary number, I enclose a foolish but 
honest contribution.

AND THE DIAL. 

Time and The Dial looked each other in the face. 
Qaoth Time to The Dial : " You have earned your 

place. 

No gall is in your vial, but with dignity and grace 
You have kept espial on the scribbling race." 

Time and The Dial shook each other by the hands. 

Quoth Time to The Dial : " You 're one that under- 
stands, 

Though a book must stand its trial, and failure 
bear the rub, 

It is better to annihilate with courtesy than club." 

Time and The Dial struck up a friendship true. 
Quoth Time to The Dial : " I beg you '11 see me 

through. 

I will take no denial, for should Golden Age accrue, 
And I turn poet, Dial, I would be reviewed by you." 

KATHARINE LEE BATES. 
Wellesley, Mass., April 12. 



In common with other literary men I have heard 
with great interest that THE DIAL is about to cele- 
brate the completion of its twentieth year of publi- 
cation. I can say in all sincerity that, busy man as 
I am, I confine my reading to a very few papers 
and periodicals, among which THE DIAL has a 
foremost place on account of the judicious criticism, 
the fairness, and the terseness which distinguish its 
contents. J. G. BOURINOT. 

House of Commons, 
Ottawa, March 81. 



THE DIAL is to be heartily congratulated on the 
attainment of its twentieth birthday. It is easily 
our most valuable literary review. It has been 
faithful to the best literary traditions from the 
first, and will no doubt continue to be so. 

JOHN BURROUGHS. 

West Park, N. Y., April 7. 



I note with pleasure the completion of THE 
DIAL'S twentieth year, and heartily congratulate 
you. By the sanity of its literary judgments, by 
the catholicity of its tastes and of its opinions, and 
by the responsible character of its signed book re- 
views, THE DIAL makes a peculiarly strong appeal 
to men and women interested in the study of lit- 
erature, and in the development of high standards 
of literary taste and judgment, in the United States.

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



It is a cause for congratulation among all lovers 
of good literature that a paper like THE DIAL has 
been able to live twenty years and not only live 
but thrive. It is one of the very few publications 
in this country devoted to such matters, that is 
dignified, self-respecting, intelligent, and reliable. 
Long may its banner wave ! R ICHABD BURTON. 

University of Minn., 
Minneapolis, April 5. 

The completion of THE DIAL'S twentieth year of 
publication is something upon which the American 
people, as truly as the paper's conductors, should be 
congratulated. THE DIAL has maintained a stand- 
ard of literary excellence, of critical faithfulness, 
and of probity and dignity, which has been the more 
valuable because emanating from a part of our 
country which itself proudly insists upon its new- 
ness. It has, moreover, done American literature a 
special service by^mresentingly resisting pressure 
which every such publication must encounter in our 
land and day to use those catchy methods of re- 
view and editorship which yield pages so easy to 
read that they are still easier to forget. Long live 
THE DIAL, which chooses to draw its faithful 
shadow not from the earth, but from the sun. 

GEORGE W. CABLE. 

Northampton, Mass., April 5. 

I love THE DIAL, and count it among the choicest 
journals that come to my hand. It has been my 
welcome companion from the first number, and has 
held me in touch with the best thought in Chicago, 
so long my home, and the region we call the Mid- 
dle West, which was " Way out West" when I went 
to live there more than forty years ago. I read THE 
DIAL also because I like to be well informed about 
what is going on in the world of letters, and feel 
sure it is no mere mouth-piece or hired servant of 
the publishers, and I know of no higher praise. 

ROBERT COLLTER. 
New York, April 18. 

I read THE DIAL with interest because it does 
not delude me with false pretensions. I like it 
because, on the whole for it is a bit unequal, and 
sometimes falls below its highest standards its 
tone is mainly neither truckling nor captious ; be- 
cause it stands for ideas and principles, and does 
not pander to the idle whimsies of the passing 
hour, nor feed each baneful madness as it arises. 
I admire it because it is not only readable, but 
seems to me to stand for enlightened patriotism, 
for order and progress, for the encouragement of 
wholesome literature, and to be strong and brave 
enough to utter its opinions in the teeth of those 
who, whether carelessly or wilfully, strive to be- 
little and overthrow the institutions which are the 
hope of humanity. May it flourish until those in- 
stitutions have triumphed over all their foes, and 
may it have an honored place in the procession 
which celebrates the victory 1 ALBERT S. COOK. 

Yale University, New Haven, Conn., April 21. 



For the past eight years I have read THE DIAL 
every issue. I have had from it during those years 
more satisfying and exact criticism in literary mat- 
ters than from all the other magazines I have ever 
read in all the years of my life. I wish I could 
say more of the uprightness, dignity, and intel- 
ligence which speak to me from every page of THE 
DIAL. But my words, however expressed, would 
fail to tell you all I think so these few lines 
must suffice. 



ALICE MORSE EARLE. 



Brooklyn, N. Y., April 7. 



I send my greetings and congratulations to you 
upon the completion of the twentieth year of the 
publication of THE DIAL. I recognize it as a pow- 
erful force in the strengthening and purification of 
contemporary literature. It has done much for the 
cultivation of taste and the elevation of literary 
standards in our country. It is a force which I 
should be sorry to miss, and, with the growth of our 
country, I heartily wish THE DIAL not only pros- 
perity but length of days. 

WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS. 

Ithaca, N. Y., April 9. 



I am glad to learn of THE DIAL'S anniversary. I 
cannot believe that it is twenty years since the world 
has had the advantage of reading THE DIAL. But 
I do know that the world has advanced in every- 
thing admirable in that time, and I am quite sure 
that THE DIAL may claim a noble place in that 
advance. EDWARD EVERETT HALE. 

Roxbury, Mass., April 9. 



It is a great pleasure to join with a word of con- 
gratulation your many other readers, on the occa- 
sion of the twentieth anniversary of THE DIAL'S 
founding. I cannot, to tell the truth, look back 
over THE DIAL'S two decades ; it is the second 
only that I survey, with lively feeling when I 
think of the continual interest and stimulus with 
which I have considered the results of your work. 
There are many forms of criticism, but in almost 
all of them there is the possibility of sincerity, 
scholarship, dignity. THE DIAL can show in the 
long run most of the different critical tempera- 
ments. That is due to its contributors, who will be 
different by nature. But with all such differences, 
there will be something that remains the same, and 
this it is which the paper itself supplies. This spirit, 
this character, THE DIAL has long had, nor do I 
think the last decade has altered it, save in the way 
of strengthening. I can couple no better wish with 
my congratulations than a hope that in all the 
changes among its contributors, it will preserve the 
character and tone which have now so long distin-

The citizens of Chicago should congratulate them- 
selves that THE DIAL has reached the twentieth 
year of its publication. It means much for Chicago 
and the Northwest that THE DIAL has made steady 
forward progress, and, as it is a source of help to 
every man or woman who is interested in intellect- 
ual matters, every such man or woman should help. 
THE DIAL. Many of us at the University will join 
in congratulating its editor that the journal has 
reached the age of twenty years.

I have always felt proud of THE DIAL'S excel- 
lent editing and judicial criticism, and have always 
been thankful that such a journal could be published 
in the great Western metropolis. I am therefore 
glad that you are celebrating the twentieth anni- 
versary of this remarkable periodical. 

WILLIAM T. HARRIS. 
Bureau of Education, 

Washington, D. C., March 31. 



I beg to extend to you my hearty congratulations 
upon the near completion of the twenty years of 
THE DIAL. I know of no publication that for the 
last twenty years has more consistently and success- 
fully contended for the best things in literature than 
has THE DIAL. D> c HEATH. 

Boston, March 30. 



Allow me to congratulate you upon the twentieth 
birthday of your valuable publication. The career 
of THE DIAL has been creditable to American lit- 
erature, in my judgment, as regards ability, integ- 
rity, and independence. 

THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. 

Cambridge, Mass., April 11, 



I congratulate THE DIAL upon its anniversary, 
and I wish for it an increasing success, because THE 
DIAL represents a thoughtful consideration of cur- 
rent literature. It is not only that THE DIAL has 
maintained a high standard of critical comment that 
I wish it well, but also because THE DIAL is so im- 
portant a medium of literary interpretation in the 
great empire which may roughly be termed the 
Middle West. I know and care much for the West, 
which is proving its literary possibilities, just as it 
has long since proved its right to a commanding 
place in the business world. I wish you good things 
for the future. RIPLEY HITCHCOCK.

I am glad of the opportunity to send a word of 
congratulation not only to you, but to the reading 
public, and the public which may yet be cultivated 
to read, on THE DIAL'S having completed twenty 
years of its useful career. Whatever may be the 
attitude of the East toward the culture of the West, 
I at least have been rejoiced to find in Chicago an 



organ whose judgments on literary matters have 
commanded my respect so thoroughly. Long may 
your work continue, and great may be your satis-

I wish prosperity in all ways to THE DIAL. 

HENRY IRVING. 
Providence, R. I., March 28. 



I am glad to congratulate you on your twentieth 
anniversary. THE DIAL has always stood for 
character. It has the old Puritan conscience on 
which everything that is lasting in our country is 
built. It is sane, wise, truthful ; it is honest, hope- 
ful, and kindly, and with all this it is the best journal 
of literary criticism which we have, and we ask no 
better. DAVID S. JORDAN. 

Stanford University, Cal., April 18. 



I hope THE DIAL'S sun may never go back on it 
(a circumstance unusual, but with biblical prece- 
dent). ANDREW LANG. 

St. Andrews, Scotland, March 29. 



THE DIAL has been for years not only a comfort 
but rather a mystery to me. Amid its time and 
circumstance it has seemed very much as to one 
scaling the Bolivian Andes would seem a hail in 
pure English from the cliff above. An adventitious 
piquancy is doubtless added to our surprise by the 
mere fact of locality; but the intrinsic wonder is 
to find such a journal published anywhere, to-day. 
Even a frontiersman may be forgiven sensitiveness 
over the spread of insincerity, flippancy, shallow- 
ness, commercialism, in American letters ; and re- 
lief at finding here and there an undraggled stand- 
ard. For the frontier is far enough from the foot- 
lights to get perspective on the stage ; and near 
enough Nature to retain some notion of what the 
make-believe really all comes to. In such a seat 
even the dullest onlooker may learn. My first 
knowledge of THE DIAL came about by a personal 
suggestion by Whittier, who practiced what he 
preached. During all the years since, it has been 
a preferred creditor, putting me deeper and deeper 
in its debt. Of more than a hundred periodicals 
every month brings to my desk, there are two I in- 
variably read throughout "The Nation" and 
THE DIAL. Critical criticism is as valuable as it 
is rare. Sometimes I find it elsewhere. I can 
depend on finding it here. And with it the anti- 
dote for many imminent pessimisms. In any serious 
adjudication we must, I believe, rank as one of the 
finest and rarest achievements in American jour- 
nalism the upbuilding, through a changeful genera- 
tion and in its most fevered city, a review so cool, 
so sane, so competent, so unbitten with our generic 
new unrest ; so immune against our penny-foolish- 
ness and our Yellow-plush attitude to literature ; so 
even-handed in upholding so high standards of

criticism. The twentieth anniversary of such a 
paper seems to a Far Westerner to call for more 
than the mere perfunctory compliments of the day. 
It is a due time to express the sincere gratitude of 
such Americans as find, in general, not too many 

things to be grateful for. 

CHAS. F. LUMMIS. 

Los Angeles, Cal., April S. 



From the very beginning of its career THE DIAL 
has stood consistently for the highest standards of 
literary art, for sound and true workmanship, for 
large and sane views. It has been notably free 
from provincialism of taste, and from the weak- 
ness of confusing the novel and striking with the 
true and the real. It has kept the perspective of a 
comprehensive knowledge of literature, and has 
happily combined loyalty to the great traditions 
with love of freedom and openness of mind. Its 
wise conservatism has been a check to eccentricity 
of taste ; its catholicity has kept it in touch with 
the best in contemporary writing. It has been a 
medium for sound scholarship, and it has steadily 
encouraged that quality of mind which makes way 
for true art even where it does not produce it. In 
the intellectual history of two decades it has loyally 
served the best interests of American scholarship 
and literature; while its dignity and moderation 
have done much to disseminate good taste and a 
true valuation of sound form. 



New York, April 5. 



HAMILTON W. MABIE. 



My congratulations to THE DIAL on its growing 
age. Men shrink from the crowding years : a jour- 
nal should rejoice in them. THE DIAL has been 
coming to my library table for a long decade ; and 
I look to it with confidence for seasoned opinions on 
the literary movements of the time. I wish it a green 
old age. 



Brooklyn, N. Y., April 16. 



EDWIN MARKHAM. 



I like your journal thoroughly, and wish it well, 
and hope it may have a long life in which to 
show (as it has shown in all the past) that dignity 
and conscience and kindliness may go to good criti- 
cism, without sacrifice of thoroughness, or of acumen. 

DONALD G. MITCHELL. 
Edgewood, April 11. 



L beg leave to congratulate the editors of THE 
DIAL on its twentieth anniversary. I do not think 
you would wish me here to praise at length the 
scholarly breadth, and the good manners of its criti- 
cism. I have read it for years, and it has always 
given me the impression of being in the company 
of refined gentlemen who are agreeably relating the 

literary affairs of the day. 

S. WEIR MITCHELL. 

Philadelphia, March 28. 



I congratulate THE DIAL on its birthday and 
wish it a great many more of them. Like Mr. 
Riley's old man who'd turned threescore and ten, 
" it has found out the trick and can do it again." 
The trick in THE DIAL'S case has been always tell- 
ing the truth, fearlessly though modestly. I believe 
that by doing so it has won the confidence of both 
writers and readers. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 

Philadelphia, March SO. 



It gives me pleasure to say that for nearly all the 
past twenty years I have read THE DIAL con- 
stantly, and found it speaking with dignity and au- 
thority on the subjects which have interested me. 
Its reviews appeal to me as do those of the best 
English papers, minus the acidity. I congratulate 
you upon your fifth of a century, and I sincerely 
hope you may attain to the rounded century itself. 

HARRISON S. MORRIS. 
Philadelphia, March SO. 



THE DIAL has long seemed to me to be one of 
the best and most successful efforts ever made in 
this country in sound literary criticism. Its stand- 
ard has been high, and it has been intelligent and 
just. Its editors and publishers are to be sincerely 
congratulated on their achievement and on the suc- 
cess which has crowned their twenty years of work. 
HENRY LOOMIS NELSON. 

New Rochelle, N. Y., April 10. 



I am glad to offer you my congratulations on the 
completion of the twentieth year of the life of THE 
DIAL, but I feel even more inclined to offer my 
congratulations to its readers, to whom this anni- 
versary gives assurance of the prosperity and per- 
manence of a journal which they could ill spare. 
The good sense, the sound critical judgment, the 
liberal spirit, the high principles of THE DIAL, all 
maintained with simplicity, steadiness, and without 
pretension, have secured the respect as well as the 
cordial regard of its readers. It has been from the 
outset one of the best evidences of the civilization, 
and one of the best agents of the culture, of Chi- 
cago- CHARLES ELIOT NORTON.

As a lover of good literature I admire and sym- 
pathize with your efforts to speak of letters as they 
should be spoken of as something affecting the 
highest interest and most enduring emotions of 
mankind. In these days Literature is in danger of 
being degraded to an infinitely lower level than 
when it lurked in the squalidest attics of Grub 
Street ; it is falling a prey to the most ignorant and 
pernicious kind of smart society journalism, or it is 
being listed as a brand of national output on the 



1900.]

same level as hides and tallow, shoddy cloth or pat- 
ent medicines. All honor to the journal which still 
judges the product of man's thought and fancy by 
other than a cash standard, and is more concerned 
to appreciate the work than to gabble pointlessly, 
where not offensively, about the worker. Cordial 
greeting and good wishes. ALFRED NUTT. 

London, March 28. 



It is a pleasure to congratulate THE DIAL upon 
the completion of twenty years of distinguished 
service to the higher life of America. The qualities 
which I admire most in THE DIAL are its public 
spirit, its courage, its wholesome plainness of speech, 
its severe standards of literary excellence, and its 
freedom from mere literary gossip. 

BLISS PERRY. 

Boston, April 111. 

I learn with pleasure of your twentieth anniver- 
sary celebration, and wish to congratulate you on 
the event. I am, as ever, cordially interested in 
the continued prosperity of the journal which has 
done so much for good literature and whose stand- 
ard of criticism and of literary presentation is so 
high and so refined. Q EO> HAVEN PUTNAM. 

New York, March 28. 



I first saw a copy of THE DIAL some six years 
ago, and since then have read it regularly. I re- 
gard it as one of the very best of our literary peri- 
odicals, and have always taken pleasure in com- 
mending it in my lectures and lessons. I am glad 
it is to celebrate a twentieth anniversary. 

W. J. ROLFE. 

Cambridge, Mass., April 16. 



It is a pleasure to think that THE DIAL has lived 
a score of years. No motley fool ever drew it from 
his poke and looked at it with lack lustre eye, for 
it makes no appeal to such. The lovers of good 
literature, and those who believe in the dignity of 
literature, are especially grateful to it for its free- 
dom from petty gossip ; one can really tell time by 
THE DIAL: it does not confuse one by having a 
looking-glass face. HORACE E. SCUDDER. 

Cambridge, Mass., April 9. 



While noting the fact that THE DIAL has made 
its regular appearance under that name for a term 
of twenty full years, I think it especially worth while 
to bear in mind how steadfast the paper has been in 
its aims, purposes, and methods. Many periodicals 
have changed editors, altered their form and ap- 
pearance, and still more greatly changed their 
policies and objects. But THE DIAL has gone 
serenely forward, true as steel to its own high 
ideals, and faithful to its own high standards of 
criticism and canons of good taste. I have had the 



pleasure and advantage of a familiar acquaintance 
with THE DIAL ever since its first days. Those who 
have known THE DIAL do not need to be told how 
perfect has been the discriminating sympathy of its 
editor with all that has been finest and best in our 
literary and social progress. With all deference to 
other editors, I cannot think of any in our own gen- 
eration, east or west, who has seemed to me so con- 
sistently devoted to the best ends of criticism and 
literary journalism, and so wholly free from com- 
mercialism on the one hand or passing fads on the 
other. THE DIAL has always preferred the signed 
review. It has kept itself free from that anonymous 
pettiness, detraction, and stabbing-in-the-back that 
has prevailed in some other quarters, and that has had 
the effrontery to palm itself off for scholarly and 
sincere criticism. THE DIAL has had no blacklist 
of authors whom its editor and its reviewers have 
conspired to write down and injure irrespective of 
the merits of their books. Those log-rolling methods 
so prevalent in the literary journals and book- 
reviewing circles of London, and to some extent sup- 
posed to be known also in New York, have never 
been countenanced by THE DIAL. The paper has 
on the contrary sought always to be just and con- 
siderate. 

ALBERT SHAW. 

New York, April 4- 



All health to THE DIAL ! From no literary jour- 
nal, foreign or domestic, have I derived more profit 
during the twenty years of its existence a time 
in which it has been needful for me to keep in touch 
with current publications. The review has been so 
free from the " diseases of childhood," nervous or 
otherwise, as to constitute it almost a species by 
itself. On the rare occasions when a reader dis- 
sents from its criticism, he must still recognize its 
good taste and style, its scholarship, and the open 
mind of the reviewer. Nothing less, I think, could 
have enabled THE DIAL to thrive and continue, in a 
country where too meagre a support is given by the 
book-trade and the public to our few strictly critical 
journals. THE DIAL has been of such service that 
it would be ill indeed if anything were to hinder its 
future life and increase. 

EDMUND C. STEDMAN. 

Bronxville, N. Y., April llf. 



It is my opinion that THE DIAL occupies a lead- 
ing position in the front rank of purely literary 
periodicals, published in the English language, and 
I congratulate it on its twentieth anniversary. 

FRANK R. STOCKTON. 

Charles Town, W. Va., April 11.

Congratulations to THE DIAL on its twentieth 
anniversary, to its publishers and its editors, 
whose good work from the far away beginning I 
have personally known, good because sincere, 
strong, refined, sane, in spite of appalling contem- 
porary inducements to blaze, and glare and vul- 
garity and the tyranny of cliques.

I note with interest that you are approaching 
your twentieth birthday. My profession naturally 
compels me to do a large amount of reading, and 
therefore I can only skim many American papers 
that come into my hands, but of the two or three 
that are always attractive, I confess THE DIAL 
takes almost first place, as I find it keeps me au 
courant with American books. May you have 
many years of successful career in the interest of 
good literature. T . FISHER UNWIN.

Congratulations to THE DIAL on its twenty years 
of life ! It has always stood for intelligence, hon- 
esty, and sobriety qualities which are still (thank 
heaven ! ) held in esteem. More power to its elbow 
in these days when the sense of proportion seems 
to be forgotten, and hysterical enthusiasm blazes 
its yellow way through the book-review and the 
literary appreciation " ! J OHN C y AN D YKE . 

Guaymas, Mexico, April 12. 



THE DIAL is certainly to be congratulated upon 
having reached a vigorous and prosperous man- 
hood, and gained the solid respect of the country 
as a serious and impartial journal of literary criti- 
cism, without resorting to pictures or personalities, 
or mistaking the back-stairs gossip about writers 
for literature. CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. 

Norfolk, Va., April 2. 

Your paper has so constantly combined kindness 
of temper with frank honesty of critical opinion

mitted to offer congratulations on its twentieth birth- 
day- BARRETT WENDELL.

A DIRECTORY OF THE AMERICAN 
PUBLISHING TRADE. 



In connection with THE DIAL'S twentieth anniversary 
number, it has been thought that a complete and authorita- 
tive Directory of the American Publishing Trade, as consti- 
tuted May 1, 1900, would be of value and interest, and accord- 
ingly the following list is presented to our readers. The 
Directory has been prepared especially for this issue of THE 
DIAL, from information furnished for the purpose by the pub- 
lishers themselves. The data given, which is necessarily lim- 
ited and condensed, aims to cover the following points : Firm- 
name in full, successive changes in firm-name with dates of 
such changes, names of officers or present members of com- 
pany or firm, special line of publications, number of titles on 
list, address in full. It is believed that no name of any sig- 
nificance in the legitimate publishing trade of the country has 
been omitted. It may be mentioned that in a few instances 
publishers failed to respond to our request for information, 
and in such cases the firm-name and address only is given.

Competition was not very marked, and cus- 
tomers received little attention; but with the 
advance of civilization came the demands for 
better methods. In no line has the evolution 
been so great as that of bookselling. From 
the old time-honored dingy shop, with its 
high shelves, has developed the modern book- 
shop, with its glass cases, convenient arrange- 
ments, and abundance of light. From a very 
limited class of book-buyers we have broadened 
out into an intelligent, book-loving and book- 
reading nation, and to meet the wants of 
thousands of book-buyers, to whom a good 
book-shop is inaccessible, the system of 

Selling Books by Mail 

Has been established. To this class of read- 
ers we offer our services, together with one 
of the best equipped book-shops in Chicago. 
Catalogues on application.

A TWENTIETH CENTURY BOOK. 

About My Father's Business. 

The work treats of the present social conditions in 
the churches, showing the lack of force and power in 
spiritual life by the encroachment upon it of social 
pleasures; its reasons for failing to reach the masses; 
the abuses of power and influences on the part of some 
of its rich members, who frequently use the church as a 
cloak for the advancement of their selfish ambitions and 
designs. While the book has a religious flavor, at the 
same time it advances some very strong themes of 
morality and philosophy. You should read it.

Good Books Just Issued 

THE INDIANS OF TO-DAY. By GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL, Ph.D. 4to, buck- 

ram, with fifty full-page portraits of the most famous chiefs. Price . . . $5.00 

It is generally acknowledged that Mr. Grinnell is the authority on American Indians. For the first 

time in many years a serious attempt is made to deal fairly with the Indian of to-day; his past, his present 

conditions, and his future chances. The book is illustrated with a remarkable series of photographs, taken 

by Mr. F. A. Rhinehart during the Congress of Indians at the Omaha Exposition. 

SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN. His Life Story, with Letters and Reminiscences. 

8vo, cloth, with many illustrations $3.50 

This is the authorized biography of the great composer. It has been prepared under his personal 

supervision and revised by him in proof. It contains many of his letters and much intimate personal matter 

of great interest. 

"Mr. Lawrence is to be congratulated upon his book, which has its value enhanced by the inclusion of a lecture 

by Sir Arthur Sullivan upon Music, with a criticism of his sacred music by B. W. Findow, and of his secular, and more 

general work from the same appreciative hand. The publisher has given the work a worthy setting in all respects, 

making the book one of the noteworthy ones of the year." Chicago Times-Herald. 

THE LIFE OF WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. By LEWIS 

MELVILLE. With portraits, facsimile of handwriting, and several drawings, many 
now printed for the first time. In two volumes. Demy 8vo, cloth, gilt . . $7.50 

Although five and thirty years have passed since his death, until now there has never been published 
a life of Thackeray which has had any pretensions to thoroughness. The present work has been written to 
fill this void in the literary history of the century. It is a complete record of the career of the great nov- 
elist, and throws many new lights upon his private as well as his public life. Thackeray is presented as 
novelist, poet, artist, and art critic, and his friendships and tastes are recorded. 

TWO GENTLEMEN IN TOURAINE. By RICHARD SUDBURY. 8vo, cloth, 
with many full-page illustrations, reproduced in photogravure $3.50 

A delightful account of the wanderings of an American gentleman and a member of the French nobility 
through the historical chateaux in Touraine. It gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the 
famous people who lived in them, and admirable descriptions of the country.

and lets him hear the tales of the widow and the disinherited client, the 
tearful confessions that have heretofore been sealed from him. He 
hears the associate counsel discuss and lay their plans for the trial of 
some cause celebre, as a council of war would prepare for battle. The 
tense interest of all connected with the trial takes possession of him ; 
his heart rises and sinks with the cause.

Cavalier, and the Puritan." 1 vol., 8vo, net . , $3.50.

Interior.

By SAMUEL BENNER. 24mo, cloth $1.00. 

This is a peculiar little volume, and the information is most valuable,

SHAKSPER NOT SHAKESPEARE. 

By WILLIAM H. EDWARDS, author of " Voyage on the River 
Amazon," "The Butterflies of North America," etc. 
12nio, cloth $2.00. 

Shaksper not Shakespeare, that is, that William Shaksper was not 
the writer of the Shakespeare poems and plays. The text is accom- 
panied by many facsimiles and illustrations. The book is the result of 
many years' patient investigation, and the argument is based on the 
testimonies of the highest Shakespearean authorities, Halliwell-Phil- 
lipps, Drs. Ingleby and Furnivall, Eleay, and others. 

SONGS OF AMERICAN DESTINY. 

A Vision of New Hellas. By WILLIAM NORMAN GUTHRIE.

rative cover, net $2.50. 

" One of the most remarkable volumes of poetry published in Amer- 
ica for many years. . . . Mr. Guthrie's theme is loftily ideal and his 
treatment is thoroughly unique. His use of new and free metrical 
forms is inspiringly bold, and some of his lyric work strikes us as being 
masterly in rhythmic execution. " The Churchman.

teristic notes of his style. In this story alone Mr. Lloyd is deserving of rank in the front among American humorists." 

The Critic: " Mr. Lloyd has a terse journalistic style and ready wit that ought to make THE CHRONIC LOAFER a 
very active feature in the book market." 

New York Times : " Mr. Lloyd has the gift of story telling with a great supply of humor."

strange and beautiful thing which we call life, but grand in

certainty of our own power and freedom."

THE BEST EDITION OF 




Illustrated Cabinet Edition in 26 Volumes 



JOHN RUSKIN stands, without a peer, the most eloquent and original of all writers on 
nature, art, and architecture in the world. As a writer of beautiful English, too, his 
" Sesame and Lilies," " Mornings in Florence," etc., have long been recognized as master- 
pieces. No previous edition of Ruskin has fully met the requirements of exacting book lovers ; 
the Illustrated Cabinet Edition, we believe, will. 

Printed from beautiful, clear type, well spaced with indented side notes, on deckle-edge, 
soft laid paper, equal to the finest hand-made as far as results in printing are concerned, and 
producing a volume light in weight. 

The full-page illustrations number 288, and include all the colored plates, steel engravings, 
etchings, and process cuts, in all the original tints. In addition to the full-page illustrations 
are the cuts in the text many hundreds of them altogether. A large proportion of these are 
from drawings by Mr. Ruskin, and are not only attractive in appearance, but are absolutely 
necessary for a proper interpretation of the text. 

The volumes are bound with flat backs and uncut edges, gilt tops, in a handsome cloth, 
with an especially appropriate full gold back design. Size, a tall 12mo. 

The works will be sold in complete sets or separately as follows at $1.50 per volume.

"MRS. PARSONS ought to be proud of the large number of followers one is tempted to say imitators that 
she has made. There are probably books to the number of a dozen which have been written on lines so similar 
to those which characterize ' How to Know the Wild Flowers ' that they amount to an infringement of intellectual 
copyright. But our author still keeps at the head of the procession, nor can anybody take away from her the 
title to priority which she holds. To many grateful Americans, young and old, she is the Columbus who 
pioneered the way for them to a new world of loving intimacy with the flowers and the ferns." Brooklyn Times. 



A NEW EDITION WITH COLORED PLATES 

How to Know the Wild Flowers 

By MRS. WILLIAM STARR DANA. 
A Guide to the Names, Haunts, and Habits of Our Common Wild Flowers. With 48 full-page colored 

plates by ELSIE LOUISE SHAW, and 110 full-page illustrations by MARION SATTERLEE. 60th Thousand. 

Crown 8vo, $2.00 net. 

This new edition has been enlarged, revised, and entirely reset, the illustrations have been remade, and 
it has in addition 48 full-page colored plates from drawings by Miss ELSIE LOUISE SHAW made especially 
for this edition. The Nation says: " Every flower-lover who has spent weary hours puzzling over a 
botanical key in the efforts to name unknown plants, will welcome this satisfactory book, which stands 
ready to lead him to the desired knowledge by a royal road. The book is well fitted to the need of many 
who have no botanical knowledge and yet are interested in wild flowers." 

"Here are new colors and new beauties held up to those who see well 
already, with new eyes for those who cannot see at all." N. Y. Times. 

How to Know the Ferns 

A Guide to the Names, Haunts, and Habits of our Native Ferns. By FRANCES THEODORA PARSONS 

(Mrs. Dana). With 144 full-page illustrations, and 6 full-page illustrations from photographs. 

Crown 8vo, $1.50 net. 

" Of the ferns, as the flowers, she writes as one who not only knows but loves them. The charm of her fern-book 
is as irresistible and pervading as is the charm of nature itself. This gifted and enthusiastic naturalist knows the 
ferns literally 'like a book,' and her book makes the first lesson of the novice in the lore of fern life an easy and a 
delightful task." New York Mail and Express. 

" This is a notably thorough little volume. The text is not voluminous, and even with its many full-page illustra- 
tions the book is small ; but brevity, as we are glad to see so many writers on nature learning, is the first of virtues 
in this field. . . . The author of * How to Know the Ferns ' has mastered her subject, and she treats of it with 
authority." New York Tribune.

" Mrs. Dana writes always of the flowers as one who sincerely loves them. The happy phrases that escape her are 
those which love alone could have inspired. The charm of this book is pervading and enduring as is the charm of 
nature.' 1 New York Times.

"DEACON BRADBURY" 

A Novel by EDWIN ASA DIX. 

" A more convincing picture of American village life has never been written." 

Chicago Times-Herald. 

" An excellent story of New England farm life, in many respects resembling ' David Harum,' and 
judging from what the critics say about it, it is likely to become as popular as Mr. Westcott's great story, 
which has been the success of recent years." Constitution, Atlanta. 

"The story is quietly and refreshingly told; the reader is introduced into the home life of a simple 
New England farmer, meets his practical, sensible wife and his daughters, young, vigorous, and honest. 
. . . The character of the Deacon stands out rugged against the homely background. Confronted by the 
awful possibility of his son's guilt, the Deacon loses his faith in the church, in the all-wisdom of Providence, 
in the mercy of a higher tribunal. . . . And then it is that the Deacon's stern conscience takes the place 
of the faith he has lost. His spiritual conflict is deep and mighty, and it works itself out slowly in that 
simple nature grand by the very force of its simplicity. We wish there were more men like Deacon 
Bradbury in this wicked world." New York Times Saturday Review.

ARDEN MASSITER 

By Dr. WILLIAM BARRY, Author of "The Two Standards." 

" We cannot sufficiently praise the art of this book. ... It is a story of the most exciting kind, with 
bandits, vendetta, abductions, murders; all interwoven with the greatest skill, so that every situation, every 
character, every event has the appearance of inevitability. . . . Let us indulge the hope of a great popular 
success for a novel which has filled us with admiration and become a permanent addition to the books we 
cherish." Literature, London. 

"... This very interesting and admirable book. It ought to have a great success." W. L. Alden's

The Light of Day. 

Religious Discussions and Criticisms from the Natural- 
ist's Point of View. By JOHN BURROUGHS. 16mo, 
$1.25; 12mo, uniform with the Riverside Edition of 
Burroughs's Works, gilt top, $1.50 net; uncut, paper 
label, $1.50 net. 

This book contains a very frank and unconventional 
statement of Mr. Burroughs's views on matters theolog- 
ical and religious. These views do not always harmonize 
with current religious opinions, but they are expressed 
with such manly sincerity and are so clearly the out- 
come of serious thinking that they must command the 
interest of all thoughtful readers. 

Evolution of Trinitarianism. 

A Critical History of the Evolution of Trinitarianism and 
its Outcome in the New Christology. By LEVI LEON- 
ARD PAINE, D.D., Professor of Ecclesiastical History 
in Bangor Theological Seminary. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 
A thoughtful and significant book, championing and 
well illustrating the historic method of study and crit- 
icism. 

From Sandhill to Pine. 

By BRET HARTE. 16mo, $1.25. 
Another volume of Mr. Harte's inimitable Western 
stories, of which the variety is endless and the charm 
unfailing. 

Love in a Cloud. 

By ARLO BATES, author of "The Puritans," "The 
Philistines," " The Pagans," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 
Mr. Bates's new story revolves about an imaginary 
anonymous novel. Curiosity about its authorship brings 
together the characters; and love, society, managing, 
and talk do the rest. Mr. Bates has told a very enter- 
taining story. 

Hotel de Rambouillet and the 
Precieuses. 

By LEON H. VINCENT, author of "The Bibliotaph." 
Artistically printed and bound, 16mo, $1.00. 
A very attractive little book, giving an account of 
the establishment and influence of the Hotel de Ram- 
bouillet in the seventeenth century and of the men and 
women who made it famous. 

The Integrity of Christian Science 

By Mrs. A. D. T. WHITNEY, author of "Sights and 
Insights," " The Gayworthys," etc. 1 vol., 16mo, $1. 
In this book Mrs. Whitney offers what she regards 
as a much needed corrective to some of the mistakes of 
Christian Science, as at present taught, and at the same 
time a presentation of broader understanding and ac-

EXTRACTS FROM A FEW 
PRESS NOTICES OF WISHART'S 




& MONASTERIES 



Mr. Wishart writes delightfully of the monasticism of the 
East, and considers exhaustively the rise, flourish, and fall of 
all the prominent orders of the past. It emphatically ought to 
take rank among the favorite volumes in the libraries of stu- 
dents of the middle ages. Philadelphia North American. 



His disposition is one of fairness and impartiality. New 
York World. 

The style in which it is written is as far removed as can be 
from the abstract and didactic. It is distinctly free, pictur- 
esque, and popular. The plan of the work has been well 
conceived, and its spirit is catholic in the most liberal sense. 
. . . To intelligently examine the principles of human nature 
in which the institution took root, to successfully trace its 
development and essential modifications, and to deal justly 
with its motives while portraying its excesses, was a task suf- 
ficiently formidable to have proved deterrent. Mr. Wishart 
. . . has completed it with superior ability. . . . It is a really 
admirable specimen of the printers' art. ... In the line of 
artistic book - making it leaves nothing to be desired. 
Brooklyn Citizen. 

He has pursued this task with conscientious impartiality, 
with an evident desire to set forth nothing but the truth. 
His style is terse and vigorous, and his narration invariably 
interesting. His book has been admirably published, hand- 
somely printed on good paper, and furnished with an exhaust- 
ive index. Philadelphia Evening Telegraph. 

A clever, popular history of the development of monasti- 
cism, its growth and decline. . . . The rise and fall of the 
monastic orders are traced in detail with scholarly breadth. 
The book is sent out in most worthy form by its publisher. 
New York Journal. 

The author has produced a thoroughly interesting and a 
thoroughly trustworthy monograph on this important subject. 
. . . The work is published in luxurious style, and contains a 
number of fine illustrations. McMaster University Monthly 
(Toronto). 

Mr. Wishart's volume gives evidence of patient industry, wise 
discrimination, and fairness of purpose. It is published in a 
form befitting so scholarly a work. Cleveland Plain Dealer. 

The work deserves the attention particularly of ecclesias- 
tics and theologians, of course, but is also written in a style 
which makes it suitable for general reading, and merits the 
perusal of all who desire light upon one of the most striking 
features of religion. Baltimore Sunday Herald.

the maps are of exceptional distinctness and value, one of the characteristic features of the work. 

Professor Tarr's geographical work is already well known : from one among many comments we may quote : "I am glad 
to express to yon my appreciation of those matchless books, Tarr's Elementary Physical Geography and its companion, the 
Geology. They lay emphasis on the right topics, and by their illustrations, which do illustrate, they almost bring field, river,

THE STAR SYSTEM IN PUBLISHING. 

A few years ago complaint was made, in 
accents more or less querulous, of the fact that 
the books which had the largest sale and en- 
joyed the widest popularity in this country were 
novels by English writers. The American nov- 
elist seemed to have no chance at all in the 
competition with his transatlantic rival. One 
of the chief arguments by which the campaign 
for international copyright had been brought 
to a successful issue was that the American 
novelist occupied a disadvantageous position in 
his own country, because publishers would nat- 
urally give preference over his work to that of 
the English novelist who was not in the position 
to exact a royalty. The plea was a sound one, 
and there is no doubt that for many years 
American novelists, as well as American writ- 
ers in other departments of letters, were put at 
a considerable disadvantage by the fact that 
publishers of predatory instincts (and such 
were not lacking) might seize upon whatever 
English books they wished, and reproduce 
them without the leave of either authors or 
proprietors. As between an already success- 
ful English novel upon which no royalty need 
be paid, and an American manuscript which 
might or might not make a successful book and 
for which the author would certainly demand 
compensation, the balance of probable profit 
turned toward the side of piracy, and the 
American writer who had not already conquered 
his public found it difficult to obtain a hearing. 
At last, however, the law was passed which ac- 
corded the bare measure of justice (or some- 
thing less than that) to the English author, 
and placed the American author in a position 
to compete with him without being handicapped 
from the start. 

In some respects the working of the law 
proved disappointing. The cheap " libraries," 
it is true, found their opportunities restricted, 
and many of them disappeared altogether from 
the market. But the anticipated " boom " in 
American literature was slow in appearing. 
English books that were worth reading, as well 
as those that were not, seemed to find their way

into our houses almost as readily as before, 
although it was no longer possible to purchase 
the latest production of Mr. Black or Mr. 
Hardy for a small fraction of a dollar. Such 
books now came to us in respectable garb, and 
were sold at a fair price. The point is that they 
continued to come and to be sold in large num- 
bers. Even our popular magazines continued 
their practice of contracting for the serial rights 
in works of English fiction, instead of offering 
that encouragement to home industry about 
which American novelists had raised such a 
clamor. There continued to be years in which 
nearly every one of our story magazines had 
for its principal feature the novel of some 
English writer, offered to readers upon the 
instalment plan. There were the stories of 
Mr. Kipling, for example, and the romances 
of Robert Louis Stevenson, with which no 
American writer of fiction could hope to com- 
pete. Then there was the series of highly 
successful individual books, beginning with 
" Robert Elsmere " and coming down in rapid 
succession to " Trilby " and " The Christian." 
The dear public wanted these books, even if it 
had to pay roundly for them ; and those who 
had expected international copyright to effect 
a revolution in popular taste found that condi- 
tions remained very much as they had been 
before. These selfish grounds were not, of 
course, those upon which the serious advocates 
of that act of plain international duty rested 
their case, but they no doubt had considerable 
influence in securing its adoption. 

The conditions of a few years ago seem, how- 
ever, to have become completely changed of 
late, and American fiction seems at last to have 
come to its own. The most striking fact in 
the publishing business of the past year is that 
of the extraordinary success of certain novels 
by American writers. Five such novels have 
won the public favor to such an extent that 
their sale has broken nearly all recent records, 
that to find its match, in the case of American 
fiction at least, we must go back to the history 
of " Uncle Tom's Cabin." That this success 
has been in all cases deserved, we are by no 
means willing to admit. Of the five novels in 
question, one is a homely character-study hav- 
ing for its passport to favor a plentiful supply 
of mother-wit rather than an effective plot. 
The other four are historical romances. One 
of these four, the work of a woman, deserves 
very high praise as representing the best type 
of historical fiction. Two of the others are at 
least admirable narratives, and present inter- 



esting phases of our colonial history with re- 
markable sympathy, industrious grasp of detail, 
and vivid dramatic force. The fourth is an 
extremely mediocre example of the class of 
work to which it belongs, common in both style 
and treatment, not noticeably better or worse 
than a score of other books of its sort published 
during the twelvemonth, and chiefly interesting 
as an illustration of what can be done for a 
poor book by shrewd and persistent advertising. 
On the whole, our cause for satisfaction in the 
success of these five novels is not so great as 
those who are interested in them would have 
us believe, and the record of their sales is a 
brilliant episode in the history of American 
bookselling rather than in the history of Amer- 
ican literature. 

Whether the publishing trade is really to be 
congratulated upon such a series of popular 
successes as this, is open to serious doubt. In 
one case, at least, the profits accruing from a 
sale of hundreds of thousands of copies could 
not avail to save a great and long-established 
house from serious business embarrassments. 
Such enormous sales of single books, of which 
the merit, even if great, is not likely to be 
fairly proportional to the sales, does not seem 
to us to betoken an altogether healthy condi- 
tion of the publishing trade. Publishers them- 
selves know well enough that their success in 
the long run depends, not upon the fortunate 
acquisition of an occasional book that enjoys a 
sky-rocket career, but upon the possession of a 
substantial list of works of permanent value, 
works that occupy a standard place in litera- 
ture and may be depended upon to provide a 
steady income for many years. The publisher 
who has a list of this sort is, of course, glad 
enough to get hold of an exceptionally success- 
ful novel from time to time ; such a book rep- 
resents to him so much clear gain, and he would 
not be human did he fail to keep an intelligent 
watch for productions of this sort. But if he 
allows his head to be turned by visions of this 
kind of luck, if he despises the more modest 
but safer ventures, if he bends his energies to- 
ward achieving an abnormal sale for a few books 
instead of a normal sale for many, he is likely 
to come to grief. His real interests lie in the 
possession of many claims to public esteem 
rather than in the making of a few successful 
appeals to popular caprice. 

It seems to us that there is an evident anal- 
ogy between the ideal of publishing that aims 
to push a few books into successful acceptance 
and the ideal of theatrical or operatic manage-

ment which depends almost exclusively upon 
the popularity of a few artists. The star sys- 
tem in stage affairs has long been understood 
by all competent observers as being extremely 
demoralizing to the true interests of art. The 
recent history of our grand opera has brought 
this principle home to many who had not real- 
ized it before. A few singers and a few operas 
become established in public favor, and the 
short-sighted policy of the management, relying 
upon this fact, gathers for the time a rich har- 
vest. But presently the public wearies of its 
favorites, and, never having been educated to 
the point of healthy musical culture which can 
find interest and inspiration in a great variety 
of works, never having been made to feel that 
the works themselves and not the manner of 
their performance should be its chief concern, 
now deserts the opera-house, in spite of all the 
allurements of new voices and new productions. 
The management then complains that audiences 
have no taste for a varied repertoire, that the 
production of untried compositions spells finan- 
cial disaster. Of course it does : the public 
should have been prepared for these composi- 
tions long before ; they should have been pro- 
duced repeatedly, even at some temporary loss, 
at the time when the public was most clamor- 
ous for the sensations of the hour. The star 
system in publishing brings about very similar 
results. Many worthy books are neglected in 
order that a few may be kept well to the front. 
When the caprice is past, when the serried 
ranks of worn copies of " Trilby " gather dust 
upon the shelves of the public library, when 
the unsold copies in the hands of the publisher 
and bookseller become " plugs," the publisher 
should then know better than to complain be- 
cause his other books do not sell. The fact 
often is that he has not tried to sell them, that 
he has left them unadvertised and uncared-for, 
that they have now lost their chance because 
his " enterprise " has seen fit to promote the 
sale of a few books at the expense of all the 
rest. The well-advised publisher, in our opin- 
ion, is the one who recognizes the evils of the 
star system, and is not misled by its promise 
of present temporary gain. He is the publisher 
who secures for his list as many books of last- 
ing value as he can. And he is the publisher 
who cares for the interest of all of his books, 
because he understands that the permanent suc- 
cess of his business depends upon the accept- 
ability of his total output rather than upon the 
vogue of a few books taken here and there 
from his catalogue. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

CHICAGO AND LONDON AS VIEW -POINTS OF 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On the twentieth birthday of THE DIAL, may I, as a 
Transatlantic reader, be permitted to offer my humble 
congratulations on the successful conduct of the paper 
for so many years, and my best wishes for a future as 
honorable as its past ? 

THE DIAL, to one who lives on this side of the 
water, has a twofold interest and importance. It keeps 
him acquainted with the course and current of Amer- 
ican literature, and with the opinions and thoughts of 
those who lead the country. It also enables him to 
understand how current English literature is regarded 
by the American critic. This is still more important 
when the judgment of the critic is influenced, as some- 
times happens, by a difference in the point of view a 
difference which the Englishman sometimes finds it 
hard to understand. The American point of view, in 
literature as in politics, must be apprehended, and it is 
too little understood. Perhaps the same thing might 
be said on the other side. 

The criticism of THE DIAL on our own writers should 
be, above all, valuable to ourselves as being absolutely 
free from personal considerations. There is no suspicion 
in its columns of log-rolling, of private friendships, of 
private animosities, such as disfigure too much of our 
criticism upon ourselves. 

THE DIAL, again, illustrates the very important fact 
that " local " or " national " literature is one thing, and 
that " English " or " Anglo-Saxon " literature is another. 
In other words, the paper enables us to realize that 
there exist, side by side, two distinct literatures: that 
of America and that of Great Britain. Practically, 
each is sufficient for its own people; each contains all 
that is wanted in art, science, philosophy, history, divin- 
ity, and every other branch. But there is also a liter- 
ature which belongs to the whole of the English-speaking 
race I call it " English " or " Anglo-Saxon " on ac- 
count of the language, but I would rather call it Anglo- 
Celtic on account of the two races which most pro- 
foundly influence this literature. It is the supreme 
prize of the modern writer a prize rarely achieved 
to speak to the whole of the English-speaking peo- 
ples, whether of America, the United Kingdom, Aus- 
tralia, New Zealand, or India. Never before in the 
history of the world has a writer had such a possible 
audience; never before has his possible influence been 
so deep, so wide, so far-reaching. 

May we not consider it an inestimable advantage that 
this part the nobler part of our literature should be 
drawn from two sources so widely apart, as regards 
that point of view, as Chicago and London ?

HONEY OR VINEGAR IN BOOK REVIEWS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An old-fashioned acquaintance of mine complains 
that reading a modern Review leaves him with an un- 
pleasant sensation as of having dined wholly off honey. 
The book- re viewer of to-day is altogether too lenient, 
too considerate, too apologetic, too blandly deferential 
a creature to suit this reader's robust taste. He laments 
the decay of that fine old spirit of ferocity which ani-

mated criticism in the palmy days when Jeffrey and his 
merry men used to fling themselves on an aspiring 
" Laker " or " Cockney " with the joy of an Iroquois 
scalping his victim, and the fluency in insult of the late 
Mr. Brann. The most readable thing in the world, he 
thinks, is a merciless " roast " of a new book some- 
thing in the way of Macaulay's flagellations of Croker 
and Robert Montgomery. Holding these opinions, this 
charitable soul was naturally much gratified the other 
day when a well-known critic proclaimed in print the 
present crying need of a Review conducted on the old 
savage Edinburgh lines. The article in which this 
opinion is aired smells, it is fair to say, suspiciously of 
paradox. But, at all events, what the writer of it ap- 
pears to think is wanted in these degenerate days of 
critical urbanity and super-abundant human kindness is 
a Review whose amiable specialty it shall be to damn 
and disparage, to thwart the " booms " of publishers, to 
clip the wings of aspiring young authors, to knock new- 
born reputations promptly on the head, and, in fine, to 
play in the world of current letters a part not unlike 
that played in politics by Marat's L'Ami du Peuple. 

Now I, for one, should be very sorry to see a recru- 
descence in criticism of the spirit of " Maga," which 
was so largely a spirit of malice, not to say black- 
guardism, exercised by a parcel of spiteful scribblers 
against better men than themselves. An ill-natured 
reviewer who takes pleasure in saying things likely to 
wound the feelings and cloud the prospects of his author, 
seems to me about as respectable a person as the scamp 
who strews tacks on a cycle path. But deprecating 
a return to the old gall-and- wormwood style of criti- 
cism does not estop one from regretting a tendency in 
the modern Review to eschew fault-finding altogether 
and become a mere honey-pot. It can hardly be denied, 
I think, that the criticism of the modern reviewer is 
mostly of a sort that does more credit to his heart than 
his head. His eagerness to praise constantly impels 
him to over- praise to lavish upon mediocrity terms 
that should be reserved for genius. I have often 
thought that the sanguine American lady who was 
gently taken to task by Matthew Arnold for asserting 
that excellence is " common and abundant " mast have 
been a great reader of Reviews. The habit would easily 
account for her cheerful delusion. 

Perhaps, after all, a slight infusion into the honeyed 
sweetness of the new Review of the spice and vinegar of 
the old might not be unsalutary. yf f R t ],

DEATH OF A JAPANESE SCHOLAR AND 

EDUCATOR. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

The recent death of Dr. Toyama, President of the 
Imperial University at Tokyo, is an event worthy of 
being chronicled in an American journal in view of his 
residence and education in the United States, as well as 
by reason of his distinguished position in literature, 
education, and public life in Japan. His study of En- 
glish, in which he later became so proficient, was begun 
at the early age of thirteen in his native laud. He 
studied abroad twice: first in the sixties, when he was 
sent to London, and was the first, and at that time the 
only, Japanese student in that great metropolis; and 
second, in the seventies, when he pursued courses of 
study in Ann Arbor (Mich.) High School, graduating 
later from the University of Michigan. Returning 
to Japan, he entered upon a long service in the Imperial 



University, Tokyo, of which he finally became President. 
In 1898 he served as Minister of Education for a few 
months in Marquis Ito's short-lived Cabinet; and he 
was also a prominent member of the House of Peers, 
where he was known as a forcible and brilliant debater. 

It is, however, to his literary work that most general 
interest attaches. He is said by a leading Japanese 
journal to deserve very great credit for being " the first 
to recognize the advantages which the Japanese poet 
might derive from a study of European models "; and, 
in collaboration with others, he developed the Shin- 
taishisho, or " Poetry of New Form," which is properly 
said to mark " an epoch in the history of poetry in 
Japan." This new style of poetry ignores the old short 
suggestive odes, and seeks to adapt the long poem to 
modern conditions. Dr. Toyama himself brought out 
a poem on the great earthquake of 1885, "which has 
not only great merit in itself, but occupies a unique 
position in Japanese literature." This new school of 
poetry manifested its aspirations not only in original 
poems, but in translations from English verse. The 
latter include " The Mariners of England," " Charge of 
the Light Brigade," Gray's "Elegy," Longfellow's 
" Psalm of Life," and four extracts from Shakespeare. 
Mr. Aston, in his " History of Japanese Literature," 
thus characterizes the style of this new school : " Toyama 
and his colleagues, finding the ancient classical lan- 
guage unequal to the expression of the new ideas 
[Western], and largely unintelligible to a modern public, 
frankly adopted the ordinary written language of the day, 
which had hitherto been only used for popular poetry of 
the humblest pretensions. In their choice of themes, in the 
length of their poems, and in the general tone of thought, 
the influence of European models is plainly traceable." 

Regarding the unification of the written and spoken 
languages of Japan a measure so important to the 
future of that country a recent number of that influ- 
ential newspaper, the " Japan Mail," says: " It is really 
preposterous that a country should have two languages, 
one for writing and the other for speaking. The ques- 
tion bears incidentally on the position of women in 
Japan, for since the language used by men when dis- 
cussing any subject outside the daily routine approxi- 
mates to that of books and newspapers, it cannot be 
understood by a woman unless she has received an ex- 
traordinary education, and the result is that intellectual 
intercourse between the sexes becomes impossible." 
The influence of Dr. Toyama on this and other measures

THE ABSORPTION OF LITERATURE. 

Great Master, whom disciples greet with awe, 
Throughout the toiling day your art is schooled 
To urge that man may govern life with law, 
And philosophic empires may be ruled : 
At dusk your eyes are strenuous no more ; 
Then unafraid I come ; most lovingly 
I lay my head upon your arm ; therefore, 
Knowing right well how clearly I shall see, 
Yearnings you picture far more precious, deep 
As fill the state foreknown of youth when led 
To gather First and Last within its sweep 
And with transcendence sweeten death's dear dread. 
This proud faith then my happiness assures : 
Till death your thoughts are mine, and mine are yours.

IN NORTHWESTERN HUNTING GROUNDS.* 

A book from the pen of that keen Nimrod, 
mountaineer, sportsman-naturalist, and very 
agreeable writer, Mr. W. A. Baillie-Grohman, 
is always sure of a welcome as broad as the 
section of the reading public its genre appeals 
to. We are not ourselves, we admit, thor- 
oughly in sympathy with the instinct which 
impels men like Mr. Grohman and our stren- 
uous Colonel Roosevelt to devote their allot- 
ment of leisure largely to hunting down and 
slaying the " native burghers " of forest and 
plain. But there is this to be said for Mr. 
Grohman and his kind : that he is no less de- 
voted to the preservation than the killing of 
big game (paradoxical as it may seem), and 
that if we are to have any big game at all 
in this country worth mentioning twenty-five 
years hence it will be largely due to the efforts 
of the "gentleman sportsman" to prevent its 
extinction at the hands of the game-butcher, 
through game laws scientifically framed and 
properly enforced. Mr. Grohman has some 
wise words to say on this slighted theme of 
American game preservation which we com- 
mend to the special attention of those inter- 
ested. 

Mr. Grohman's latest production, " Fifteen 
Years' Sport and Life in Western America 
and British Columbia," is of rather miscella- 
neous content, embracing matter of interest not 
only to the amateur of wild life and the chase 
generally, but also to those in quest of practical 
information from an original source as to the 
conditions and outlook that confront the pio- 
neering settler or the investor in the raw North- 
west Mr. Grohman's knowledge in this order 
being derived from some stirring and pictur- 
esque, if not wholly satisfactory, experiences 
in the eighties as a land concessionnaire in the 
then virgin Kootenay region of British Colum- 
bia. The account of the author's pioneering 
in Kootenay occupies about a quarter of the 
volume, and forms a lively and rather instruct- 
ive off-hand picture of frontier life, well 
seasoned with stories stirring or humorous, of 
which Mr. Grohoian has an unfailing stock.

adds her mite in the shape of an amusing 
chapter on Chinese servants. Certain views 
of one of these pig-tailed domestics, devel- 
oped in the course of discussions with " Missus 
Gloman " on questions more difficult even 
than those of frontier housekeeping, are worth 
quoting. 

" Why [said the author] do you take chickens and 
wine and cakes to the graves of your uncles, and then 
bring them back to Chinatown and eat them yourself ? 
You must know, as you eat them yourself, the things 
can be of no good to your dead relations.' 'You see,' 
replied he quickly, taking up a cup, and holding it in 
front of a lamp so that a sharp shadow was thrown on 
the white tablecloth. You see that,' pointing to the 
shadow, ' dead men all the same that, he eat all the 
same that (shadow) of food and wine, I this,' flicking 
the cup with his finger; < if I no get all the same this, 
me die pretty soon quick.' . . . ' Pull down the other 
blind, the sun is coming in.' ' This morning I pull down 
one blind, sun look in that window, now he look in this 
window, bye and bye he look in another window, and 
then white man say sun he no walkee; he walkee all the 
time; white man heap liar.'" 

Mr. Grohman's opening chapters are in his 
more familiar vein, and treat for the most part 
of sporting lore and adventure pure and sim- 
ple, under such captions as Travelling in the 
Western Hunting Grounds ; the Slaughter of 
Big Game and the Game Laws of America ; 
the Wapiti, its Antlers and its Chase (with 
illustrations taken from the now rare catalogue 
of the great American Trophy Show of 1887) ; 
the Antelope Goat of Pacific Slope Mountains ; 
the Moose, Caribou, and Deer of the Pacific 
Slope; the Bears and the Bison of North 
America ; the Salmon of the Pacific Coast. A 
special chapter is devoted to a quasi-scientific 
discussion of the seal and other fur-bearing 
animals of the Pacific Coast, and of the inter- 
national difficulties that have from time to 
time grown out of the pelt-hunting industry on 
the northwest coast. As to the Alaskan pur- 
chase, Mr. Grohman observes : 

" The million and a half sterling paid for Alaska in 
1867 secured to the United States the last remaining 
retreat of the pelt-bearing ferce naturae on the globe. 
To pay for a territory nine times the size of England 
and Wales what we would expend upon two first-class 
inonclads, was not a bad bargain. A fraction less than 
a penny per acre permits a good many of them to con- 
sist of barren rocks or swamps, without making it a 
losing transaction. And when we hear that on two of 
its tiny islands, sixty square miles in extent the famous 
Prybiloffs Nature has created and is maintaining a 
unique mine of untold wealth, that has already more 
than repaid the Government dollar for dollar the mil- 
lions paid to Russia, the true character of astute Brother 
Jonathan's last ' Conquest by the Almighty Dollar ' 
begins to dawn upon one. If we add the further tri- 
fling detail that on another tiny isle there is a gold mine

that has already produced more gold than the whole 
country cost, our admiration for America's commercial 
wisdom is only increased. . . . What a profitable 
investment the purchase of Alaska has proved to be 
for the United States is shown by the fact that in the 
twenty-one years (1870-90) the rent and taxes of the 
Prybiloffs amounted to 1,250,000 and the duties on 
the returning dressed skins " (almost the entire Pry- 
biloff catch goes to England for dressing, and about 
half of it returns to this country and is heavily taxed 
on entry), "amounting to over one million sterling, 
brought the total up to 2,250,000. Verily a famous 
purchase!" 

After giving an interesting sketch of the 
history of the pelt-hunting industry in Alaska, 
including a description of the Prybiloff rook- 
eries (one is tempted to ask, with David Cop- 
perfield's aunt, " Why rookery ? ") during the 
breeding season, Mr. Grohman goes on to de- 
scribe and discuss pelagic sealing, and to give 
his opinion touching certain vexed questions 
which the industry has given rise to. That 
pelagic or open-sea sealing is, as American 
authorities contend, infinitely more wasteful 
than the leisurely abattoir - like methods of 
killing pursued at the rookeries, where only 
animals of suitable age and sex are taken, he 
has no manner of doubt ; and the facts he ad- 
duces certainly seem more than sufficient to 
bear out his conclusion. The waste of pelagic 
sealing is the necessary result of haste, of poor 
marksmanship *(a large percentage of wounded 
animals escaping capture to die a lingering 
death later on), and of conditions that prevent 
deliberate and accurate selection of victims 
many breeding females being uselessly and 
wastefully slaughtered. To the plea that 
defends pelagic sealing as being the more 
" sportsman-like " method, Mr. Grohman re- 
plies with a sportsman's indignation and a rea- 
sonable man's disdain : 

" One plea advanced by those blindly favoring the 
British case, which otherwise is such a preeminently 
sound and just one, is particularly unfortunate. When 
condemning the land killing as conducted on the rook- 
eries as ' rank butchery,' as ' a revolting destruction of 
animal life,' ' as cruel as it is unsportsmanlike,' ' slaugh- 
ter of animals without giving them a chance for their 
lives,' etc., one can only shake one's head in indignation 
at such unreasonable special pleading. Even some of 
those voicing their authoritative opinions in the Blue 
Book pander, one regrets to see, to this inhuman plead- 
ing. Par. 610 says: 'The accusation of butchery laid 
against those who take the seals on shore cannot be 
brought against this pelagic method of killing the seal, 
which is really hunting' (save the mark!) 'as distin- 
guished from slaughter, and in which the animal has 
what may be described as a fair sporting chance for its

reads : " Issued to-day to my boats 300 rounds of ammuni- 
tion ; all expended, and got one sealskin." 



life.' Was ever more mischievous nonsense written ? 
Does it not stand to reason that the method which 
eliminates all chances of (1) a lingering death from 
wounds, (2) that spares all females, (3) that prevents all 
avoidable waste of life, (4) that kills in a merciful way 
only those animals that are best suited for the uses to 
which their pelt is put and that can best be spared in 
the economy of seal life, is a better and more humane 
method than one which fails to regard any one of these 
important considerations ? One might just as well 
argue that, instead of putting our cattle to a speedy 
and painless death, we should turn them loose in a 
deep lake and shoot them or wound them from un- 
steady boats, letting those that are not killed instantly 
die a slow death and sink out of sight. There is no 
more reason for depriving a steer of a ' fair sporting 
chance for its life ' than a bachelor seal when its skin is 
at its best." 

The preservation of the fur seal is, Mr. 
Grohman thinks, more feasible than that of 
any other wild animal. 

" With a birth-rate of about 143,000, as estimated 
by the most recent and entirely trustworthy examina- 
tion by Professors D'Arcy Thompson for the British 
and Starr Jordan for the United States Government, it 
js surely possible to insure the perpetuation of the race ; 
while 100,000 would, it is said, amply indemnify the 
Canadians for completely ceasing pelagic sealing." 

It will be gratifying to sportsmen to know 
that so high an authority as Mr. Grohman does 
not at all agree with those writers who reach 
the mournful conclusion that American hunt- 
ing grounds are, in respect of big game, virtu- 
ally " shot out." Prince Wied, writing sixty- 
five years ago, deplored the disappearance of 
bighorn and wapiti, while a more recent visitor, 
Lord Dunraven (he of " concealed ballast " 
memory, we suppose) writes : " An English- 
man going to the States or to British American 
territory for big game shooting, and for noth- 
ing else, is sure nowadays to be disappointed." 
Says Mr. Grohman : 

" Both were right so far as the country they passed 
through was concerned, both were wrong in their gener- 
alizations. There are even to-day countries, the size of 
small kingdoms, in British North America into which 
no hunting party ever penetrated, and where the frying- 
pan's capacity of a few prospectors has, so far, meas- 
ured the destruction of game; countries where moose, 
caribou, and antelope-goat are still unfamiliar with the 
sight of white-skinned human beings. ... I enjoyed 
unrivalled sport in years subsequent to the period when 
the author of the ' Great Divide ' expressed such a 
pessimistic view, and that concerning localities not a 
hundred miles west of the country through which he 
passed." 

Mr. Grohman shows much appreciation of 
the humor, as well as the humors, of the Far 
West, especially of the " tall stories " charac- 
teristic of that land where, proverbially, " talk 
is cheap and lies are worth nothing." One of 
the "tallest" of the stories, taken from a

Western newspaper, may be subjoined as a 
close to our quotations. 

" A wonderful fish is becoming numerous in Goose 
Lake. It is called by some the ' greenback ' fish, for it 
is certainly an inflationist. It has the power to fill itself 
with air until it becomes very much like a round ball. 
Of evenings about sundown they may be seen playing 
on the surface of the water. They will swell up by 
taking in the air, and the wind will blow them over the 
lake. They reflect all the colors of the rainbow, and 
when sporting over the lake are a grand sight. A 
hunter several weeks ago saw a crane swallow one of 
these fish when in its normal condition, but before the 
crane had got fifty feet above the lake the fish had 
taken in enough air to explode the crane, which, at the 
sound of a report like that of a gun, flew all to atoms, 
and the fish came lightly down on the water, no worse 
off for the short ride in the air. The fish is a great 
curiosity, never having been found, I believe, in other 
waters." 

What a fine item that would have made for 
Doctor Goldsmith ! * 

Mr. Grohman qualifies the title of his book 
by stating in the preface that he did not live 
for fifteen consecutive years on the Pacific 
Slope. He spent the greater part of each of 
fifteen years there, his first four or five visits 
being devoted exclusively to big game shooting. 
The natural grandeur and ample promise of 
the magnificent domain to the west of the 
Rockies are glowingly and picturesquely de- 
scribed, for, it is fair to say, Mr. Grohman 
views nature with the eye of a lover and an 
artist, and not merely with that of a hunter, 
and as an arena for the sportsman. In point 
of literary quality this latest production of Mr. 
Grohman's is hardly up to the level of one or 
two of its predecessors, the delightful " Sport 
of the Alps " for example ; but in spite of its 
occasional lapses of style it is in the main 
crisply and pleasantly written, and is packed 
with information on points as to which the 
author is a recognized authority. The book is 
handsomely made and copiously illustrated. 
The frontispiece, a fine photo-process plate, 
shows the author seated contemplatively in his 
study at Schloss-Matzen, surrounded by tro- 
phies of his gun, notably the superb wapiti head 
familiar to readers of English and Continental 
illustrated sporting journals. While this noble 
head is doubtless a source of much pride to 
Mr. Grohman, it should also, we should say, 
form something of a thorn in his conscience.

THREE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF 
FREEDOM.* 



With the publication of the three volumes 
telling of the lives of Chase, Sumner, and 
Adams, the collection of short biographies 
called the " American Statesmen Series " is 
complete. A carefully prepared index-volume 
is promised, which will make the thirty-one 
distinct books a connected whole, and will 
vastly enhance their value to the student of 
American history, who has already learned to 
esteem them of much importance in a consid- 
eration of the varied political problems which 
have attended the development of the United 
States. 

The three men studied in the volumes now 
at hand have many traits in common. Each 
was an individual of marked personality, firm 
in conviction and fearless in action. Each one, 
despite many reasons which might have per- 
suaded to the contrary decision, broke away 
from old political associations and joined the 
forces of the " Conscience " voters of the North, 
when the slavery question was the burning one 
of the day. And when the " irrepressible con- 
flict " finally came, each one contributed a most 
important part to the history of his country. 

The place of Mr. Chase is fairly shown by 
Professor Hart in these words : 

"At first an obscure member of a little group of 
anti-slavery politicians, he came to something like 
headship of that party in the campaign of 1848. He 
was the first efficient anti-slavery senator, and in his 
management of the opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska 
Bill showed great qualities as a parliamentary leader. 
He came forward as secretary of the treasury in the 
midst of chaos, and made suggestions and developed 
financial ideas which may have been imperfect, but 
which were so clear and definite that Congress was com- 
pelled to adopt most of them. Almost single-handed, 
he began the attack upon the sixteen hundred state 
banks, which were the entrenched fortresses of a vicious 
sytem, and compelled both bankers and congressmen to 
accept a better scheme. More than any other man, he 
seized upon the conditions of the Civil War as leading 
straight to the legal and political freedom of the negro, 
and to him more than to anyone else is due that system 
of negro suffrage which he advocated, not because he 
thought it was ideal, but because he saw no half-way 
place in giving to the negro his long-usurped rights. 
In his latest years he well used his opportunity to 
stand for the principle of limited powers, as against 
the conception of a sovereign legislature, both in the 
State and in the Union." 

The quotation indicates the importance of 
the part played by Mr. Chase, and also shows

the three well-defined periods of his life : that 
of the leadership of anti-slavery forces in the 
West, that of the secretaryship of the Treas- 
ury, and that of the judgeship. Mr. Hart has 
followed these lines of division, half the volume 
being taken with the first period up to the time 
of Mr. Lincoln's election. The situation in the 
Middle West is shown to have been a very 
interesting one, and the forces at work, espe- 
cially in Ohio, were many, all tending strongly 
to influence a man of Mr. Chase's personality 
to join hands with the friends of the slave. 
The chapters devoted to cabinet membership, 
including the straining of relations with the 
President, and to the problems of Reconstruc- 
tion as they came before the Supreme Court, 
are full of important suggestions ; but the early 
parts of the narration perhaps deserve more 
notice, because they deal with less familiar 
themes. The faults of Mr. Chase are clearly 
set forth, notably those which cropped out in 
connection with his hopes for the presidency. 
The illumination of history through biography 
has been Mr. Hart's evident purpose, rather 
than the setting forth of personal details, which 
might have made the volume easier reading, 
but at the sacrifice of a prevailing method of 
historical writing. 

By far the most interesting narrative of the 
three under consideration is that concerning 
Charles Francis Adams. It does not cover so 
large a period as that of the other two states- 
men, Chase and Sumner. One paragraph sums 
up this period thus : 

"The active public life of Mr. Adams practically 
ended, as he had surmised it might, with the Geneva 
arbitration. It had extended over just thirteen years. 
It covered the whole period of the Civil War, including 
the process of Reconstruction; and he was, in all re- 
spects, singularly happy in the share of the work allotted 
to him. It was important; it was work for which he 
was by nature peculiarly adapted; it was done amid 
congenial surroundings; it was complete; and it was 
successful. A public man could ask for nothing more. 
The contentions in which he was engaged were of sur- 
passing magnitude, and involved momentous conse- 
quences ; they extended through a long period of time ; 
they were carried on wholly with foreign nations; and 
in their conduct he came in collision with some of the 
foremost of European public men. Yet his success was 
as final as it was complete and unquestioned. When 
he landed in New York on November 13, 1872, he had 
a right to exclaim, as he did, ' lo Triumphe ! ' for every 
issue between Great Britain and the United States 
growing out of the great Civil War was either definitely 
settled, or was in course of early settlement. His work 
was done; and done thoroughly." 

The issues with whose discussion Mr. Adams 
was intimately associated were those connected 
with the treatment accorded to Confederate 



representatives in England, the Trent Affair, 
General Butler's famous Order at New Orleans, 
the Cotton Famine, the question of recognition 
of the Confederacy, the Emancipation Pro- 
clamation, the Alabama case and the Laird 
Rams, and the Geneva Award ; some attention 
being paid also to the attitude of France toward 
the diplomatic questions of the day. It is ex- 
tremely interesting and suggestive to look at 
these matters from the point of view of one 
who was in a foreign country at the time, 
charged with the welfare of his native land, 
and yet having for his guidance neither a clear 
knowledge of affairs at home, nor a definite 
understanding of the workings of the mind of 
the Secretary of State. Oftentimes, in the ab- 
sence of information, the ambassador of the 
United States had to grope blindly. It was 
very fortunate for the country that Mr. Adams 
was a man of prudence and good sense, else 
some rash step might have precipitated the 
trouble which above all it was his particular 
duty at that time to prevent. The slowness of 
means of communication very probably saved 
the Union from serious difficulty with England ; 
and no one can read this short story of Mr. 
Adams's experience during the Civil War with- 
out understanding the great change which has 
necessarily come over diplomacy since the lay- 
ing of the Atlantic cable and the introduction 
of other improvements in the methods of speedy 
communication. The corrective value of the 
account of the work of Mr. Adams in connec- 
tion with an examination of Mr. Seward's 
career as Secretary of State will be readily 
appreciated by the reader of this little book ; 
and all will wish for a speedy publication of the 
promised larger work, which is to include the 
various letters and papers of Mr. Adams. In 
a study of father by son, especially of an Adams 
by an Adams, a tendency to overestimation 
might be expected ; but such a charge cannot 
lie against this book. The treatment is candid 
and fair, and the general impression made upon 
the reader is that this will rank among the best 
of the monographs contained in the "American 
Statesmen Series." If there was to be criticism 
of the style employed, it might attach to the 
constant use of illustrations from card-playing, 
which are so numerous as to be almost offensive. 

Two brief paragraphs from the life of Charles 
Sumner will indicate the ideas of the author 
regarding the place of the third of the three 
friends of freedom. 

" Charles Sumner was a great man in his absolute 
fidelity to principle, his clear perception of what his

country needed, his unflinching courage, his perfect 
sincerity, his persistent devotion to duty, his indiffer- 
ence to selfish considerations, his high scorn of anything 
petty or mean. He was essentially simple to the end, 
brave, kind, and pure. In his prime he was a very elo- 
quent speaker, and his unbending adherence to the 
highest morality gave him insight and power in dealing 
with great questions and a strong hold upon the moral 
forces of the country. . . . From the time he entered 
public life till he died, he was a strong force constantly 
working for righteousness. He had absolute faith in 
the principles of free government as laid down in the 
Declaration of Independence, and he gave his life to 
secure their practical recognition. They were not to 
him glittering generalities, but ultimate, practical 
truths, and in this faith Lincoln and Sunnier were one. 
To Sumner more than to any single man, except pos- 
sibly Lincoln, the colored race owes its emancipation 
and such measure of equal rights as it now enjoys. To 
Sumner more than to any single man the whole country 
owes the prevention of war with England and France 
when such a war would have meant the disruption of 
the Union." 

Mr. Sumner entered the Senate in 1851, 
and soon indicated very clearly the position he 
was to take in the impending crisis. His illness 
as a result of the Brooks assault took him 
abroad, and the great part of his life-work was 
done after he returned to his seat in the Senate 
in December, 1859. Mr. Storey claims for 
him an influence in connection with the Trent 
affair which is not recognized at all by Mr. 
Adams, and, indeed, taking these three books 
together, one finds a number of cases where 
the relative claims of Chase and Sumner, or 
Sumner and Adams, seem to overlap, and to 
need sifting by comparative study. But the 
efforts in behalf of the negro do not need denial 
or limitation. What Mr. Sumner accomplished 
may be indicated by quotation from his letter 
to the Duchess of Argyle, dated July 4, 1864. 
" Congress will disperse to-day, having done several 
good things: (1) all fugitive slave acts have been re- 
pealed; (2) all acts sustaining the traffic in slaves on 
the coast from one domestic port to another have been 
repealed, so that now there is no support of slavery in 
our statute-book ; (3) the railroads here in Washington 
have been required to admit colored persons into their 
carriages; (4) greatest of all in practical importance, 
the rule of evidence excluding colored testimony in the 
United States courts has been abolished. All these 
measures are now the law of the land. They were all 
introduced and pressed by myself." 

Mr. Sumner took many positions, in his later 
life, which angered his former friends and led 
to estrangements from those with whom he 
had often worked in harmony. It is possible 
that Mr. Storey has unduly emphasized the 
importance of his hero in these connections. 
But the many intricate and perplexing prob- 
lems of Reconstruction days are discussed with 
sustained interest, so that this volume will be 



used frequently by students who desire to get 
information and suggestion about them. 

In fine, here are three studies of three 
great Americans who had much to do with 
making the history of their country in a time 
of grave national peril. The volumes meet a 
positive want. There have been biographies 
of Chase and Sumner, but they were written 
some time ago, and were without that fine dis- 
crimination which is marked in these books, 
which are written according to later historical 
methods, and will be respected because in them 
mere eulogy gives place to sober and thought- 
ful consideration of great national problems 
reflected in the lives of a nation's great men.

ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND MEN.* 



To the American, still floating in a hetero- 
geneous and various national life devoid of 
great centres of interest and incapable of habit- 
ual concert of action with many of his fellows, 
the compactness and solidarity of the national 
life of England is a constant wonder. An aris- 
tocratic government conspires with geograph- 
ical conditions to make this possible, with con- 
comitant age and settled institutions ; but the 
surprise with which the American realizes the 
almost literal truth that everyone in England 
worth knowing knows everyone else worth 
knowing, is never ceasing, and not without a 
tinge of envy. 

Such books as these under consideration 
show how great a part the two ancient English 
universities play in this unification of men and 
ideas. Mr. J. Willis Clark, registrary of the 
University of Cambridge, in a series of brief 
biographies commemorates ten men of his uni- 
versity with a complete understanding of and 
sympathy with their lives and aims which is in 
itself proof of the intimacy referred to. These 
articles include accounts of William Whewell, 
master of Trinity ; Connop Thirlwall, bishop 
of St. David's ; Richard Monckton Milnes 
(Lord Houghton) ; Edward Henry Palmer, 
professor of Arabic in Cambridge, most cruelly 
murdered in* the Arabian desert by Bedouins ;

animal morphology at Cambridge, lost in an

tion, indeed, he only received an honorary de- 
gree. Such work as this, some of it brought 
forward by way of a review of a biography of 
the person commemorated and some of it by 
way of obituary notice following close upon 
death, lacks the formality and heaviness which 
attends the preparation of too many memoirs, 
and may be said to represent at its best that 
sort of publicly intimate account of a life which 
does away with the possibilities of such mis- 
haps as befell Carlyle's memory at the hands 
of Froude. 

Of a different nature since Mr. Clark is 
concerned with all manner of activities, polit- 
ical, popular, and scientific as well is the 
Rev. Mr. Donaldson's "Five Great Oxford 
Leaders." The five include John Keble, John 
Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey, 
Henry Parry Liddon, and Richard William 
Church. As is to be expected from so august 
a list of theologians, the work becomes a per- 
sonal history of the Oxford movement which 
brought the Church of England into possession 
of many long foregone uses and doctrines in 
the nature of a more Catholic feeling. The 
book as a whole revolves about its central figure, 
that of Dr. Pusey, in whose life alone is the 
detail furnished which brings the others into 
connection with it, chronologically and in other 
respects. Here too is that animating spirit of 
broad comprehension which adds so greatly to 
the value of Mr. Clark's work. The Rev. Mr. 
Donaldson is a part of the time he interprets 
so vividly, and he fairly makes the past, living 
in the successors of the five men, live in the 
present with them. In more places than one, 
the feeling of his pages amounts to tenderness 
and beautiful affection. 

More points of resemblance exist between 
the two books just discussed than with the 
third, Mr. Thomas Arnold's Passages in a 
Wandering Life "; yet between this last and 
its predecessors there are more points of re- 
semblance than of difference, and the dramatis 
personce of the three, so to speak, are much 



the same. Mr. Arnold is the second son of 
Dr. Arnold of Rugby, his elder brother, 
Matthew, having been born December 24, 1822, 
and himself November 30, 1823, and the por- 
trait of the author here used as frontispiece 
showing a marked personal likeness. But Mr. 
Arnold became a wanderer on the face of the 
earth soon after his graduation from Univer- 
sity College, Oxford ; seeking occupation in 
New Zealand, where he led a life in the forest 
remote from civilization for a time ; then pass- 
ing over to Tasmania to become, like his more 
famous brother, an inspector of schools, a posi- 
tion he soon lost through his union with the 
Church of Rome ; then to Dublin, to accept the 
chair of literature in the newly founded uni- 
versity there, and to labor under John Henry 
Newman for six years ; then to Oxford to prepare 
pupils for admission to the university, alternat- 
ing his residence there with life in Dublin after 
an appointment as fellow of the Royal University 
in the Irish capital ; and finally, since the death 
of Mrs. Arnold in 1888, to roam about through 
Europe at intervals, writing betimes and ad- 
vancing the cause of his Church. 

The book which tells all these things is not so 
well unified as might be expected, but is often en- 
tertaining and never without interest, whether 
the author is telling of his experiences at the 
antipodes, defending his ideas of what a Catholic 
university ought to be, or enjoying a sly jest at 
the church of his fathers, as in this anecdote : 

" Monckton Milnes was strolling on the beach at 
Jaffa, when a boat arrived conveying some distinguished 
strangers. These were the new Evangelico-Anglican 
bishop Dr. Alexander, who had come to take possession 
of the see of Jerusalem, and the members of his family. 
The Greeks on the shore, whose language is the lingua 
Franca of debased Italian commonly spoken in Syria, 
watched the landing with the greatest interest. The 
shovel hat, correct Episcopal attire, and knee-breeches 
of the bishop, who was the first to land, impressed them 
greatly. ' Vescovo! Vescovo! ' they cried out in admira- 
tion. Mrs. Alexander followed. The Greeks were 
puzzled, but being informed by some one that this was 
the bishop's wife, they shouted, but in a lower key, 
Vescova! Vescova! ' Finally, four or five children of 
various ages came up the beach after their mother. 
Ascertaining who these were also, the Greeks threw up 
their hands in unbounded astonishment, exclaiming, 
' Vescovini! Vescovini! ' " 

The " Bishop," " Bishopess," and " all the little 
Bishops " of the story were the more wonderful 
to the Greeks because of the Episcopate of the 
Greco-Russian Church being recruited exclu- 
sively from the monastic orders. 

Mr. Arnold discloses an agreeable person- 
ality in his book, and is an acquaintance one 
feels glad to have made. WALLACE RICE.

THE CL.IMAX OF MASPERO'S ORIENTAL, 
HISTORY.* 



The third and last volume of Professor Mas- 
pero's great " Histoire Ancienne des Peuples 
de 1'Orient " appears in its English dress under 
the unconventional title of " The Passing of 
the Empires." This, with the two preceding 
volumes, " The Dawn of Civilization " (1894) 
and " The Struggle of the Nations " (1897), 
give us the most scholarly, the most popular for 
its compass, the most complete, and the best 
up-to-date history of the peoples of the ancient 
Orient yet produced. Professor Maspero's sci- 
entific methods, his command of the literature 
of his subject, and his power of popularization, 
have made this work of indispensable value 
both to the history-specialist and to more ad- 
vanced students and readers of ancient history. 

The first two volumes in English dress were 
provocative of sharp criticism because the au- 
thor's views of biblical criticism had not been 
faithfully transferred and represented. The 
present volume appears not to be subject to 
such strictures. Indeed, the committee of the 
English publishing society assumes no respon- 
sibility for the positions taken by the author 
on biblico-critical matters. 

This third volume covers a period of over 
five hundred years, and the years most eventful 
for the kingdoms of Israel and for the great 
nations who swayed their sceptre over these 
kingdoms. This half-millennial period saw the 
decline and fall of the great civilizations located 
on the Euphrates and the Tigris in the East, 
and on the Nile in the West, before the invin- 
cible arms of the Greek. This period, too, sur- 
passes all others in the abundance of its avail- 
able original historical documents, found in the 
temples, tombs, and mounds of the Orient. 
The abundance, importance, and scope of these 
inscriptions, and the readiness with which they 
yield to the efforts of the translator, have made 
this section of ancient oriental history pecu- 
liarly new and attractive. The continuity of 
the history and its character, as illustrative of 
Israel's times and life, present special claims 
upon the attention of students of biblical lore. 

Professor Maspero treats this stretch of time 
and its body of events in seven comprehensive 
chapters, as follows : I., The Assyrian Revival 

* THE PASSING OF THE EMPIKES, 850 B. C. TO 330 B. C. By 
O. Maspero, Professor at the College of France. Edited by 
A. H. Sayce, Professor of Assyriology, Oxford. Translated 
by M. L. McClure, Member of the Committee of the Egypt 
Exploration Fund. With maps, three colored plates, and 
numerous illustrations. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



and the Struggle for Syria ; II., Tiglath-pileser 
III. and the Organization of the Assyrian 
Empire, 745-722 B. C.; III., Sargon and Sen- 
nacherib (722-681) ; IV., Esarhaddon and 
Assurbanipal ; V., The Medes and the Second 
Chaldaean Empire ; VI., The Iranian Con- 
quest, and VII., The Last Days of the Old 
Eastern World. Each chapter is preceded by 
an analysis, without, however, any indication 
of the pagination referred to. This deficiency 
is somewhat relieved by the fact that the head- 
line of the right-hand page names the theme 
discussed on that and adjoining pages. 

Although not a recognized Assyriologist, the 
author has fully utilized the valuable material 
furnished by this department of research. He 
has scanned the whole horizon of learning 
within his period of study. The evidence of 
his wide research, and the proof of the truth- 
fulness of his statements, are found in the ful- 
ness of the footnotes, often swollen, though in 
finer type, to one-third and occasionally to more 
than one-half of a page. This critical and 
bibliographical material is the scholar's pride 
and a precious possession, but it is the disturber 
of the peace of mind of the conscientious pop- 
ular reader. A careful examination of several 
sections of the work reveal the author's wise 
discrimination in the selection and marshalling 
of his facts. He has constructed the narrative 
with due regard to the amount and kind of 
available material, and has produced in proper 
proportions an interesting, connected, and lucid 
history. 

Questions of biblical criticism properly re- 
ceive slight attention. Where they touch the 
historical narrative, however, somewhat more 
would be expected. Belshazzar, for instance, 
is noticed as a son of Nabonidus (p. 635), but 
the question of his identity with the character 
in the book of Daniel is passed over in silence. 
It is evident from the few statements made 
that the author is progressive in his views, and 
is not retarded by any immovable prepossession 
in his interpretation of the facts of biblical and 
contemporaneous history. The author's com- 
prehensive grasp of his subject, his masterful 
method of arraying his facts, his transparency 
of style, and his candor and fairness in argu- 
ment, will heartily commend the work to the 
mind of every reader. 

The annual output or outcome of excavations 
in the East is so great that the final word of 
to-day may be superseded to-morrow. The firs 
two volumes of this great work should be sup- 
plemented already by the latest finds in Tello,

Susa, Armenia, and Egypt. The last word

Scholars will remember, and all readers will 
learn, that even this best up-to-date history of 
the Orient, encyclopedic and authoritative as 
it is, must be supplemented and modified by 
subsequent discoveries. The work is profusely 
illustrated with elegant drawings made by the 
artists Faucher-Gudin and Boudier, which add 
greatly to the pleasure and profit of the reader.

RECENT FICTION.* 



" Among the works of every writer of fiction 
there are generally one or two that owe their being 
to some haunting thought, long communed with 
a thought which has at last found living shape in 
some story of deed or passion." These words are 
placed in the forefront of Mr. Egerton Castle's 
latest and most ambitious romance, " The Light of 
Scarthey." This book, he goes on to tell us, is his 
" dream-child," the " one nearer his heart than all 
the rest." Knowing the charm of Mr. Castle's work, 
its pathos and its passion, its tenderness and its dar- 
ing invention, such introductory phrases as these 
set high our anticipations we expect all the ro- 
mantic glamour and full-blooded charm of " Young 
April " and " The Pride of Jennico," and something 
more as well, something deeper and more inti- 
mate. In this we are not disappointed. Both 
the setting and the execution of the story are

highly successful in their appeal to the intelligence 
and the sympathies. The scene is the England 
of nearly a century ago more than a century 
ago at the outset, for the first scenes are placed 
in the time of the French Terror, and the closing 
episodes have to do with the events of the Hundred 
Days. The story is not, however, as one might 
infer from these facts, concerned other than inci- 
dentally with French history. Scarthey is on the 
coast of Lancashire, and the hero is an Englishman, 
although the heroines for there are two, mother 
and daughter are Frenchwomen. The former, 
loved by the hero with all the reckless passion of 
youth, is the victim of a Republican noyade ; the 
latter, who comes unexpectedly into his life a score 
of years later, is equally beloved, with the more 
restrained but really richer passion of ripened man- 
hood. There is one jarring note in the romance. 
It is not found in the difficulty of making the love 
for the daughter appear natural for a man in whom 
the fires of passion seemed to have been long 
burned out this difficulty is triumphantly sur- 
mounted. It is found rather in an escapade of the 
later heroine, for which we are wholly unprepared, 
and which does not accord with her character as 
previously revealed. We cannot quite reconcile 
ourselves to this sudden transformation ; it seems 
like an evil dream rather than a possible actuality. 
But this one defect does not greatly mar our enjoy- 
ment of the book as a whole, which is picturesque 
in treatment and flushed with color. The characters 
are firmly and clearly drawn, and their creator has 
imparted to them the unmistakable breath of life. 

Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill's " Savrola " was 
published as a serial three years ago, and now ap- 
pears in book form. It is described as ' a tale of 
the Revolution in Laurania," and is a romance of 
the familiar " Zenda " type. The Republic of 
Laurania would be difficult to locate upon the map. 
It is a Mediterranean state, possessing a fleet and 
colonial interests in South Africa. Its President 
has ruled as a dictator for several years, and the 
people are restless. The revolution of which this 
story tells us is of the social democratic type, and ends 
with the death of the tyrant, and the union of his 
beautiful widow with the leader of the revolt. The 
story is rather dull at first, and its movement slow ; 
but the pace becomes quickened about midway in 
the volume, and there is no lack of excitement to- 
ward the close. 

" The Gentleman Pensioner," by Mr. Albert Lee, 
is a romance of the conventional pattern, filled with 
heroic emprise and desperate peril. It tells of the 
period in the reign of Elizabeth when the Catholic 
plot was ripening, and called for the most energetic 
measures on the part of the Queen. An important 
message is entrusted to one of the Queen's servants, 
to be delivered into the hands of General Hunsdon. 
Since this message contains the plan of campaign 
against the conspirators, they seek by every means 
in their power to gain possession of it before it can

be delivered. The adventures of the messenger, 
and his successful performance of the task com- 
mitted to him, make up the whole story. The Queen 
of Scots figures incidentally in the closing chapters, 
and her removal to a place of safety eventually 
thwarts the rebellious Catholics. The story is well 
told, and the author deserves especial praise for 
knowing when to stop in the invention of new perils 
for the hero, and of other familiar devices for 
" prolonging the agony " at critical junctures. Few 
writers of the sort of book in question have ever 
learned this lesson. 

" One Queen Triumphant," by Mr. Frank Ma- 
thew, is another romance of the same period, the 
scene being placed only a few years later, and con- 
cerned especially with the Babington plot and the 
execution of Mary Stuart. The hero is a soldier 
of fortune, steadfast in his allegiance to Elizabeth, 
although his loyalty is sorely taxed by his sympa- 
thies for the unfortunate Queen of Scots. The 
heroine is no other than the child of Mary Stuart 
and Bothwell, supposed to have died in the hour of 
her birth. But the heroine in this case counts for 
little, since the rival queens occupy the foreground, 
and claim most of the interest of the readers. The 
figures of Burleigh, Walsingham, and Leicester take 
conspicuous places in the narrative, and illustrate, 
as well as those of Elizabeth and Mary, the author's 
really remarkable powers of character delineation. 
For this romance is far more dramatic than most 
works of the class to which it belongs ; it is con- 
cerned with character quite as much as with plot, 
and mere narrative, so comparatively easy of exe- 
cution, gives place to animated dialogue, which few 
writers of historical fiction know how to manage. 
Very much out of the ordinary is this reconstruc- 
tion of a fascinating chapter of history, and not 
more than one book of its sort out of a score achieves 
a like degree of excellence. 

" Yeoman Fleetwood," by Mrs. Francis Blundell, 
is a novel of English life in the days of the Re- 
gency, and has for its hero a prosperous tiller of 
the soil, possessed of a remarkably simple and up- 
right character. He is, indeed, almost the only 
person in the narrative who inspires our sympathy, 
for the remaining characters are representatives of 
county families, and the distinction of caste between 
Fleetwood and the others is made the leading mo- 
tive of the tale. The snobbishness of all the other 
people concerned makes them very disagreeable, 
and even the heroine, lovable as she is in most re- 
spects, has to struggle with her prejudices for a 
long time before she can become reconciled to a 
union with the man who has won her heart. It 
seems to us that this note of class prejudice is a 
little forced, even for the times in which the scene 
is laid, for it is difficult to believe that people of any 
breeding at all would be capable of the sort of vul- 
garity which distinguishes most of the characters in 
their treatment of the hero. The scene in which 
the heroine, after the clandestine wedding upon 



which she has herself insisted, learns that her father 
is under financial obligations to her husband, and 
leaps to the conclusion that she has been made in 
some sort the subject of a bargain, is dramatically 
conceived, but here again the note seems to us 
forced. How she flees from her husband, plunges 
into the artificial society of which Brummel is the 
exemplar, attracts the insulting admiration of " the 
first gentleman of Europe," and is rescued from a 
midnight orgy by the husband whom in her heart 
of hearts she really loves, all of these things are 
effectively recounted, and this turmoil prepares the 
way for a happy ending. 

" The Enchanter," by Miss U. L. Silberrad, is a 
novel of which the earlier chapters promise more 
than the later ones perform. It starts out to write 
the biography of a child of genius like " Senti- 
mental Tommy " or the hero of " the Ship of Stars " 
and as long as this purpose is kept in view, the 
treatment is successful to the point of fascination. 
But when the child grows up, his fortunes become 
mingled with those of the unreal person who is des- 
ignated by the title of the novel, and who is repre- 
sented as a hypnotist and a dabbler in occultism. 
This substitution of charlatanism for psychological 
interest, this change of appeal from intelligence to 
morbid curiosity, so weakens the book that the 
total resulting impression is rather unpleasant, in 
spite of the marked ability displayed in many ways 
by this new and promising writer. 

Among recent translations of foreign fiction there 
are a half dozen particularly noteworthy volumes, 
and the most important of them, all things consid- 
ered, is Count Tolstoy's "Resurrection," which 
comes to us in a careful version made by Mrs. 
Louise Maude. The commanding position occupied 
in the cosmopolitan world of letters by the author 
of this book, and the deep sense of our gratitude to 
him for his great services to the cause of humanity, 
make the appearance of such a work in the highest 
degree significant, although even these considera- 
tions must not be permitted to blind us to its defects 
as a production of literary art. We had hoped, 
indeed, to find in " Resurrection " a worthy suc- 
cessor to " Anna Kare*nina," a book which might 
fairly be ranked among the great novels of our 
time. What we do find is a book which only a man 
of genius could have written, yet which perversely 
renounces most of the advantages which genius has 
over ordinary talent. There are episodes of the 
most poignant artistic truthfulness, there are char- 
acters delineated with a mastery almost absolute ; 
but there are also countless pages of matter having 
no artistic relevance whatsoever. The judicial pro- 
cesses of a Russian criminal court have their interest, 
no doubt, but it is not the interest that appeals to 
a reader of fiction. Neither does such a reader 
care to become involved in a lengthy argumentative 
defense of the peculiar doctrines of the late Henry 
George. Yet these two elements, alien to any 
properly-planned work of fiction, make up a consid- 



402

erable part of " Resurrection." The story is briefly 
this: The hero, a Russian nobleman, has in his 
youth betrayed a young woman of humble rank, a 
dependent upon his family. When the story opens, 
ten years have elapsed. She has been driven to a 
life of shame ; he has had the reckless career of the 
average officer and man of the world. One day he 
finds himself summoned to serve upon a jury, and 
there he meets once more the woman whom he has 
wronged. She is accused of poisoning, and her case 
is one of those which he is required to consider. 
She is not guilty, yet she is convicted, partly through 
her own ignorance of the forms of law, and sen- 
tenced to exile. His nature is profoundly stirred 
by these happenings, for he is now old enough to 
take a serious view of life, and the predisposition 
so to do is not lacking. As he reviews his career, 
his better self is awakened, and this is the " resur- 
rection " to which the title has reference. In mak- 
ing us understand the workings of this man's mind, 
at this particular juncture, the author displays his 
highest powers, and gives us a piece of psycholog- 
ical analysis which has rarely been equalled. The 
upshot of it is that he determines as far as possible 
to atone for his crime by making the convict his 
wife and sharing her banishment to Siberia. But 
he pleads his cause with her in vain, for her soul 
also is experiencing a sort of " resurrection," and 
she will not accept what she cannot consider to be 
other than a sacrifice. He persists, however, in 
making the journey to Siberia, and in doing what 
he can to ameliorate her condition. Eventually, his 
efforts secure a commutation of her sentence, and 
she marries a fellow-prisoner. All this constitutes 
a story of which the author might have made ar- 
tistic use within the limits of perhaps two hundred 
pages ; in stretching it to five hundred he has made 
of the book a tract, a study in applied Christianity, 
rather than a novel. That it is not absolutely dull 
and wearisome is the highest tribute we can pay 
to the author's art. His sincerity is so absolute, 
his conviction of the faults and follies of the social 
organization so intense, his belief in the sanctity of 
human life so impressive in its statement, that he 
holds our attention in spite of our repudiation of 
his social ideals and his theories of art. The present 
translation has been made by a competent hand, 
and there is no indication that it is not complete. 
Count Tolstoy uses plain language at times, but the 
fact that a popular magazine was unwilling to con- 
tinue the publication of the work for fear of offend- 
ing the susceptibilities of its constituency affords a 
striking commentary upon the namby-pambyism of 
our purveyors of literature for the masses. If the 
masses received less coddling, and were given more 
of the strong meat of literature in their favorite 
miscellanies, there might be some hope of raising 
the moral tone of our society. No public can be 
in a healthy frame of mind when its dovecotes are 
fluttered by such a work as " Resurrection." A few 
unnecessarily blunt phrases may well be forgiven a 



writer who brings so fundamentally inspiring a mes- 
sage to mankind. 

Next in importance among these translations is 
"The Knights of the Cross," the new historical 
romance by Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz. Only half 
of this work is now presented to the English public, 
and we are told that it is still in process of serial 
publication in a Polish periodical, but the remaining 
half is promised for an early date. Mr. Curtin is, 
as heretofore, the authorized translator. Admirers 
of the Polish novelist will learn with much satisfac- 
tion that he has returned, figuratively speaking, to 
his own soil and to the historical records of his own 
people. There are few cases in the literature of 
fiction in which a racial type has been portrayed with 
such insight and convincing art as have gone to the 
portrayal of Polish character in the great romantic 
trilogy of Mr. Sienkiewicz, and in the almost equally 
remarkable delineation of modern society given by 
" The Children of the Soil." These are his real 
works, and, however such a book as " Quo Vadis " 
may for the time being appeal to the public, it can- 
not have the permanent value of such books as 
" The Deluge " and " Pan Michael." The former 
is a brilliant exercise of the scholarly imagination ; 
the latter are creations in a very high artistic sense. 
" The Knights of the Cross " is also a creation in 
this sense, and, although the story is not thus far 
sufficiently developed to permit of judgment upon 
it as a whole, it may at least be said that in matters 
of detail the old mastery is again exhibited. We 
have the same strong types of character, the same 
union of fierce passion and tender sentiment, the 
same raciness of diction, the same blending of re- 
ligion with patriotism, and the same fine historical 
perspective that so enthralled us in the series of ro- 
mances to which " With Fire and Sword " first 
introduced us. Of the general setting of the work 
it suffices to say that it takes us back to the Poland 
of the fourteenth century, and that the order of 
Teutonic Knights, then grown corrupt and arrogant, 
is the foe against whose power the sympathies of 
the reader are invoked. There is not much fight- 
ing as yet, but the conflict is clearly foreshadowed, 
and we await the second half of the work with con- 
fidence that it will bring fulfilment of the vow taken 
by the hero, and all sorts of destruction for the ene- 
mies of the Commonwealth. It is not easy to wait, 
either, for matters are reaching a very critical point 
as the present volume closes, and we trust that the 
suspense will not be of long duration. 

Two more volumes have been added to the now 
considerable number of translations from the most 
brilliant of Hungarian novelists. " The Poor Pluto- 
crats " is the title of one of them, and Mr. R. Nisbet 
Bain is the translator. This book is a semi-barbaric 
romance of the wild Transylvanian region, a 
nineteenth-century tale which might be fitted into 
the sixteenth, were it not for certain incongruous 
accessories borrowed from modern science. We 
cannot speak very highly of this work from the 



1900.]

standpoint of serious criticism ; it is like most of 
Mr. Jokai's productions in its violation of the most 
elementary principles of verisimilitude, whether in 
arrangement of situation or in delineation of char- 
acter, and the author's determination to he startling 
at any cost must lose him the suffrages of the dis- 
cerning, although these may be made up to him ten 
times over by the applause of those who are satisfied 
with daring invention and vivid entertainment. The 
other book by this author is entitled " Debts of 
Honor," and is translated by Mr. Arthur B. Yol- 
land. The translator says that many of the author's 
countrymen consider the work his masterpiece, but 
this statement has been made concerning so many 
of the other romances of Mr. Jokai that our suspi- 
cions are aroused. Unless all of his works are 
masterpieces, we can hardly account for the fre- 
quent recurrence of the statement. " Debts of 
Honor " is a story that appeals more directly to the 
tastes of English-speaking readers than do most of 
the romances of this writer. The bizarre effects 
and romantic exaggerations which we expect from 
Mr. Jokai are not lacking in this book, but he places 
less reliance than usual upon invention, and more 
upon the delineation of credible characters and 
upon the portrayal of scenes which have a strong 
human interest. There are passages in this novel 
which stir the deeper emotions, and which display 
an unexpected mastery of the psychological problems 
involved. The plot is based upon what European 
novelists who do not know much about America are 
in the habit of calling " an American duel " that 
is, an agreement to decide by lot which of the two 
opponents shall take his own life within a stated 
time. In this case, the time is ten years, and the 
hero is made the victim of a trick. He draws the 
fatal lot, supposing the arrangement to be made in 
good faith, and not knowing that his name is writ- 
ten upon both the papers. When the ten years are 
up, his enemy appears upon the scene, gloating with 
fiendish malignity over the impending tragedy. 
Amid highly dramatic circumstances, the trick is 
exposed just in time to avert the disaster, and the 
hero learns that his debt of honor has never existed. 
The character of the hero, of the eccentric relative 
with whom the ten years are spent, and of the gypsy 
maiden who loves him, and who saves his life at the 
sacrifice of her own, are all delineated with skill 
and penetration. The book has a great deal of 
subsidiary incident, quaint domestic custom, Hun- 
garian folk-lore, and the like, all of which is subor- 
dinated to the main narrative, exhibiting a degree of 
restraint to which this writer has not accustomed us. 
On the whole, " Debts of Honor " must be accounted 
one of Mr. Jokai's best books, and we take pleasure 
in commending it. 

" The White Terror," by M. Fe^ix Gras, offers 
the conclusion of the story begun with " The Reds 
of the Midi " and continued with The Terror." 
Like its predecessors, it is translated from the 
Provencal original by Mrs. Catharine Janvier. The 



fortunes of the little Comtessine, of the group of 
friends leagued to protect her, and of the villain 
who seeks to compass her destruction, are all car- 
ried out to an artistic, if not a humanly satisfactory 
ending. At least, it is rather distressing to think 
that a convent should have proved the only possible 
refuge for the heroine, and that the hero, on his 
return from the wars, should have found that her 
vows had made any earthly union, other than that 
of souls, impossible for two lovers so faithful in 
their devotion. But such is the outcome of the 
whole history, and we must make the best of it. 
The White Terror, it seems, is the name given to 
the royalist reaction which, the first fury of the 
Revolution being spent, took possession of the prov- 
inces, and vied with the Revolution itself in its 
frenzies and its crimes. None of these after- 
disturbances were more violent than those that took 
place in and about Avignon, and here the scene of 
the story is placed. Few writers of fiction have 
handled this period of French history with the 
mastery displayed by M. Gras in the remarkable 
realistic trilogy which is now completed ; his knowl- 
edge is so intimate, his animation so unbounded, and 
the net expression of his sympathies so just ac- 
cepting the Revolution, despite its excesses, as in 
some sort a divine event that he has provided a 
really remarkable aid to our comprehension of the 
times concerned, besides telling a story that for 
mere narrative interest is deserving of cordial praise. 
Seiior Galdos is best known to American readers 
as the author of " Dofia Perfecta," but in his own 
country he is famous rather as the historical nov- 
elist of the Napoleonic period and the Peninsular 
War. His " Saragossa " is one of a series of many 
works dealing with this period, and Miss Minna 
Caroline Smith has done us a real service by trans- 
lating it into English. While we cannot allow her 
claim that it deserves to be ranked with " War and 
Peace," or even with " La Debacle," we are bound 
to admit that it is a fine example of the " dramatic 
war novel," and that its description of the famous 
second siege of the Aragon stronghold (1808-9) is 
both vivid and impressive. The heroic defence of 
Saragossa against the overwhelming power of the 
invader is one of the finest things in history, for it 
revealed the modern Spaniard as an undegenerate 
descendant of the ancient Nnmantian. We read in 
these stirring pages how the fighting was carried on 
from outwork to outwork, then from section to sec- 
tion of the city, and finally from house to house, or 
even from room to room. Valor could do no more 
than was done by the Aragonese in this heroic 
struggle, and the honors of the siege remained after 
all with the vanquished. An impassioned love story 
is interwoven with this web of historical happenings, 
but its interest is subordinate to that of the main 
issue of the romance, which makes the fate of any 
individual seem unimportant in comparison with 
the tragedy of a whole people.

[May 16, 



BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS. 



A new book Mr ' Charles Moore's " The North- 

on the Old west Under Three Flags " (Harper) 

Northwett. j 8 & va | ua ble contribution to an inter- 

esting division of history. It covers the Old North- 
west for the period of 161 years, or from 1635 to 
1796. It was in 1634 that Nicolet, the intrepid 
French explorer, discovered and passed through the 
Straits of Mackinac, making his way to Green Bay 
and the region beyond, and the next year that he 
returned to Quebec ; and it is not clear why the 
author should have selected the second rather than 
the first of these dates for his point of departure. 
For the other date the best of reasons can be given. 
That is the year when Great Britain finally relaxed 
her hold upon the Northwest, surrendering the 
posts that she had so long held wrongfully, and with 
them the control of the territory. Although be- 
longing, in law, to the United States since 1783, it 
was not until 1796 that the Northwest came prac- 
tically into their possession, and that the last one of 
the three flags was raised over it as a token of ab- 
solute jurisdiction. Mr. Moore's book has many 
good features. It is marked by conscientious study ; 
in some particulars it corrects earlier errors and 
adds to our knowledge ; while the material is well 
handled and is presented to the reader in an attract- 
ive style. The author's strength lies in his gifts of 
careful study and pleasant narration. He has a 
quick eye for the picturesque and romantic features 
of his subject, and it may safely be said that his 
story, as a whole, has never been so well told be- 
fore, that is, as a story. But when we come to 
the deeper questions that the story involves, and its 
more serious meaning, not so much can be said. 
Several instances can be pointed out where the au- 
thor has not risen to the height of the argument, 
but has failed to appreciate, or at least to set forth, 
the tremendous import of the matters with which 
he deals. Still, this defect, as the historical scholar 
will regard it, may be an excellence in the eyes of 
those readers whom the author apparently has had 
particularly in view. Probably a majority of readers 
of history look upon it as narrative, or story-telling ; 
and much can be said for this view of the matter. 
To those who take this view, if they are interested 
in the particular subject, this book may be recom- 
mended almost without reservation. We wish, 
however, that Mr. Moore had found a title a little 
less sensational, and that the publisher had put up 
the book in a more convenient and attractive form. 
It is well illustrated. 

Of the life of Thomas Campbell, in 
the "Famous Scots Series" (im- 
ported by Scribner), Mr. J. Cuthbert 
Hadden has made an amusing book. Perhaps the 
life of a man of letters is naturally more amusing 
to people who read a good deal than the life of a 
soldier or a reformer. Be this as it may, we have 
here an entertaining sketch. Mr. Hadden had one 



point in his favor, he was not forced to undue 
admiration of his subject. Campbell's is one of 
those reputations which may endure for a long time, 
if it be carefully transmitted in the histories ; but 
hardly otherwise. Mr. Hadden is quite frank in 
the matter. Of " The Pleasures of Hope " he says : 
" The poem was at least a credit to his years "; of 
" Gertrude of Wyoming," that it is " a third-rate 
poem containing a few first-rate lines." After such 
frankness, one feels safe. Campbell was a figure 
in an interesting literary period ; he was, indeed, 
in the eye of contemporaries, one of the chief fig- 
ures. His life, then, is interesting to anyone who 
likes literary history. For himself, his genius was 
apparently not great, nor his character extraordinary. 
But for a time he occupied a chief place. It must 
be added that although Mr. Hadden cannot assign 
to Campbell many literary virtues, he does bring 
to light or recollection some things about Campbell 
which are not generally remembered. Thus, he was 
sincerely and devotedly a friend to Glasgow Uni- 
versity, where he had been himself educated ; and 
he was one of the most zealous promoters of London 
University. There was more unaffected goodheart- 
edness in his active discharge of the duties of Lord 
Rector, and in his earnest effort to find the best 
principles of European education, than in all his 
poetry and hackwork. There were also other non- 
literary elements in his life more creditable than 
the literary elements, his absorption in the cause 
of Poland, for instance, and his invariable kindness 
and generosity to relations and others as well. We 
may thank Mr. Hadden for rounding out the char- 
acter of Campbell the man ; his great poems will 
probably never be read again, but it will be some- 
thing of a pleasure to realize that the author of 
" Hohenlinden " and " Lord Ullin's Daughter" was 
once something more than the thin literary shadow 
he has become. 



Wildfloweri 
and their insect 



What we understand to have been 
the first publication of the new firm 
fronds and foes. of Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
is the very attractive volume entitled "Nature's 
Garden," by " Neltje Blanchan," whose recent 
books about birds have deserved and won so large 
a measure of popular favor. It is, we believe, an 
open secret that Mrs. Doubleday is the one to whom 
we are really indebted for these delightful books 
of popular natural history. " Nature's Garden " is 
described as "an aid to knowledge of our wild 
flowers and their insect visitors." The latter part 
of this phrase shows how the work is differentiated 
from the other books about wild flowers of which 
so many have been published during the past few 
years. The writer explains her purpose when she 
says : " Inasmuch as science has proved that almost 
every blossom in the world is everything it is be- 
cause of its necessity to attract insect friends or to 
repel its foes ... it seems fully time that the 
vitally important and interesting relationship exist- 
ing between our common wild flowers and their 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



A brief 
history 
of Austria, 



winged benefactors should be presented in a popu- 
lar book." The writer has described, with special 
reference to their fertilization by means of insects, 
over five hundred species of our wild flowers. The 
descriptions are pleasantly written, avoiding sci- 
entific technicalities, yet not made offensive, as so 
much of popular scientific writing is, by assuming 
that the reader has no education worth taking into 
account. The scientific names, as authorized by 
the International Botanical Congress, are freely 
given. The species chosen are arranged according 
to the colors of their flowers. The chief attraction 
of the work, however, is provided by its illustrations. 
These are photographed directly from nature, and 
upwards of a hundred species are pictured, about 
half in black and white, the rest in colors. These 
plates, and especially the colored ones, give the 
book a unique place among publications of its class, 
and amply justify its existence. They are beauti- 
ful to look at, and are of great practical assistance 
in the identification of the species which they rep- 
resent. The book should be found upon the library 
table of every country house. 

In the preface to his " Brief History 
of Austria" (Putnam), Mr. Sidney 
Whitman states that two alternatives 
presented themselves : " either to treat of the prin- 
cipal historical events in proportion to their relative 
importance, or to give a succinct but unbroken 
record of the history of Austria as connected with 
the Imperial House. The former would have been 
a far more grateful task. On the other hand, the 
partly didactic character of this series, and the 
almost incredible fact that no consecutive history of 
Austria, such as this is, exists in any language, led 
me to forego the idea." It is to be regretted that 
Mr. Whitman's ambition made him proof against 
the temptation to take up " the more grateful task," 
for the writing of a " succinct but unbroken record " 
presents such difficulties as to deter any but a most 
resolute or a most courageous historian. The his- 
tory of Austria, to a greater degree than that of 
any other important European state, is to be woven 
from disjointed facts, impossible of correlation, and 
defying the best efforts at condensation. The uni- 
fying principle which everywhere exists in the his- 
tory of other states, and serves to cement apparently 
detached facts, nowhere presents itself in the history 
of Austria, unless indeed it be the principle of race 
hatred, the principle of disunion itself. It is not 
surprising, then, that the result of Mr. Whitman's 
labors should be disappointing, and that his story of 
Austria should be lacking in the essentials of a 
popular instructive history. That really entertain- 
ing historical writing is possible with the author, his 
" Realm of the Habsburgs " and other less ambitious 
and comprehensive works amply testify. The book 
is filled with facts, generously illustrated, fairly 
well indexed, and reasonably accurate. But that 
the writer has entered into " the real life of the 
people as they lived, labored, struggled as they 



studied and wrote, and as they amused them- 
selves," that cannot be said. The story of Aus- 
tria which shall instruct and entertain, which shall 
make its people flesh and blood, which shall live as 
history, has yet to be written. 

Valuable additions The fame f BrOok Farm ' that New 

to Brook Farm England experiment toward the' dis- 
literature. covery of a better social life, is rap- 

idly becoming world-wide ; yet the list of related 
books published as an appendix to Mr. Lindsay 
Swift's volume describing the community (Mac- 
millan) surprises the reader by the number of its 
titles. Mr. Swift's treatise is the first attempt to 
gather between a single pair of covers the gist of what 
is now in print concerning the Rev. George Ripley's 
courageous attempt to found an actual Utopia. 
Besides the mere collation of existing material on 
library shelves, the author has furnished his per- 
sonal quota of observation and judgment. Holding 
a position of responsibility in the Boston Public 
Library, Mr. Swift has had the advantages of bib- 
liographical training and unexcelled literary facili- 
ties. He is also geographically near to the hallowed 
piece of ground in West Roxbury, already gradu- 
ally becoming enveloped in the halo of tradition. 
And he has, best of all, a descriptive pen, adapted 
to keen yet appreciative analysis of the characters 
who had part in this socialistic drama, the names 
of some of whom now come for the first time into 
the full light of public day. An opening chapter 
upon the rise of the Transcendental movement, ad- 
mirable in its succinct facts, is followed by a sketch 
of the organization, resources and occupations of 
the community itself. Twenty-five of the more 
prominent scholars, members, and visitors are 
made the subjects of brief biographical treatment 
and estimate, while the full index provided enables 
the reader to find mention of more than as many 
more Brook Farmers. The last chapter, devoted 
to the closing period, shows that the decline of the 
enterprise began with the arrival of Albert Bris- 
bane and Fourierism. All in all, it is safe to say 
that Mr. Swift's book is the best single volume that 
has yet been issued upon the subject it treats, val- 
uable alike to the student and the general reader. 

A year and more ago a book was 
An old-fashioned published called " Potpourri from a 

commonplace book. *, r 

Surrey Garden," by Mrs. C. W. 
Earle. It was not widely noticed in the public 
prints, but it must have reached the attention of 
those for whom it was designed, for the author very 
shortly began to get letters from readers who de- 
sired more of the same sort. Now appears " More 
Potpourri from a Surrey Garden" (Macmillan). 
The book is dedicated to the readers of the earlier 
volume, but we think it probable that it will reach 
a wider audience. New readers will like to see the 
views which old readers had of the earlier volume, 
and will probably want to read it themselves. The 
two are among the most curious books that have 



406 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



appeared for some time. On a foundation of ideas 
suggested by her garden, Mrs. Earle has built an 
unconventional structure of domestic opinion and 
discussion (as about servants, children's health, and 
receipts for cookery), extracts of poetry and notes 
of travel, bits of diaries and criticisms on older men 
of letters. This is a singular combination, and the 
conception is at least original. It would seem at 
first as though everybody would like in it what he 
happened to like, and not much else. There is, 
however, another matter which the author herself 
once or twice remarks. The book is a singularly 
perfect mirror of the life of a cultivated woman 
living quietly in the country or in some small town, 
in her parlor and her bookroom, her kitchen and 
her garden. One place is as proper in its way as 
another, for each is but a province of her domain. 
She is not a gardener or a botanist, but a garden 
lover ; not a student of domestic economy, but a 
housekeeper ; not a critic, but a reader. She gives 
us what appeals to her quite simply, not because it 
is anything remarkable or especially to her credit, 
but merely because it has appealed to her. It is 
not strange, then, that the result should appeal 
widely to many others. 

An old-time After reading the " Life of Charles 

hero of the Henry Davis, Rear Admiral " 

(Houghton), as prepared by his son, 
Captain Charles H. Davis, U. S. N., largely from 
original letters (and re-reading most of it), it may 
be confidently stated that no career, of all the many 
in the American navy which deserve emulation, is 
better worth following than this. Born in 1807, 
graduated from Harvard College in the class of 
1825, becoming a midshipman in the service at the 
instance of Commodore Isaac Hull, Davis achieved 
a lasting scientific reputation for himself as the 
virtual originator and perpetuator of the " American 
Nautical Almanac," and by his skilful work on the 
Coast Survey. These are his contributions to his 
country's fame as a sailor and a scholar. On the 
side of the sailor and warrior, his endeavors are not 
less distinguished. It was Davis who saved William 
Walker and his fellow-filibusters from death in 
Nicaragua in 1856 ; it was Davis who planned the 
battle of Port Royal for Admiral Du Pont in 1861 ; 
and it was Davis who fought and won the battle of 
Memphis in 1862, clearing the upper Mississippi 
from the rebels forever. To all this hard and 
faithful work is to be added a consistent desire to 
avoid publicity ; a feeling that duty was preeminent 
and self nothing ; an ardent love for the Union, too 
great to permit him to be merely politic ; and a cul- 
ture which makes his letters, even the most casual of 
them, models of literary excellence. We have heard 
much, and sometimes sorrowfully, of the scholar in 
politics : here is the scholar in war, a quiet, digni- 
fied gentleman, whose place is rather in the hearts 
of his countrymen than in their mouths. As long as 
America can produce men like Charles Henry Davis, 
and enough of them, the Republic is secure. 



Mr. John Jay Chapman's third 
publication, "Practical Agitation" 
(Scribner), is a continuation of his 
" Causes and Consequences " in both matter and 
manner. Broadly speaking, it is an attack on the 
almost universal American habit of refraining from 
saying the " word in season," for fear of hurting 
someone's feelings. Holding to Judge Robert 
Grant's postulate that our national life is lacking in 
honesty because our commercial life also leaves 
much to be desired in the ethical sense, Mr. Chap- 
man finds a remedy for both evils in the pressure 
which may be brought to bear upon the offender 
through his club, his church, and his broader social 
relations. There is only one political question be- 
fore the people, in his judgment, and that is the 
question of honesty. So far as Republicans and 
Democrats are concerned, there is only one machine 
behind the two parties, and the one object of this 
compound machine is private profit at the public 
expense. Party loyalty is merely the blind thrown 
over the scene of looting in order to lead the voter 
to think of something else anything else, if only 
the machine may machinate. In this regard he 
holds that very great improvement has been made 
in a few brief years, so that in New York City 
itself it has become possible to proceed along straight 
lines of moral purpose without a thought of tem- 
porizing with iniquity or deviating into an alliance 
with wrong enthroned. From the passing genera- 
tion of hide-bound partisans Mr. Chapman looks 
for little help, indeed, no partisan can read the 
book without feeling himself a long way behind the 
age ; but great things are expected from the younger 
folk who decline to wear a collar or be labelled in 
respect of their political rights and conduct. The 
book is one to be read and digested in a year of 
presidential contest. 

It would be quite as well, in view of 

A Boer appeal to Th g to f th fi (Harper) 

the United Statet. ,,.,-, . , \ . , 

now published with the authority of 
the two South African Republics, to let the English- 
men who are not dazzled by the imperial policy make 
the argument to their countrymen and cousins across 
the sea. For, so far as the official documents which 
conclude the present volume are concerned, they are 
to be found elsewhere for the most part, while the 
preliminary papers are not nearly so forceful as the 
occasion seems to warrant. Mr. Montagu White 
prefixes an article on " The Policy of Mediation," 
a plea to the American Government for positive 
intervention. If we could mediate in the case of 
Cuba, we can surely do so, so far as principle is 
concerned, in the case of South Africa; but, as 
Admiral Mahan has suggested, intervention when 
Great Britain and her affair is concerned is a very 
different thing from intervention in the case of a 
second-rate power the difference being not at all 
in the morals of the question, but in the comparative 
sizes of the British lion and the Spanish wolf. 
The principal part of the book is taken up with an

THE DIAL 



407 



Lamb and 
Hazlitt. 



article by Mr. C. W. van der Hoogt, in the nature 
of " A Communication to the 'American People." 
It contains little that is new, and it is rambling and 
discursive. Perhaps the best point raised is in con- 
nection with the government of British Guiana, 
wherein a few British, comparatively speaking, hold 
many thousands of Dutch deprived of all political 
rights whatever, through a property qualification 
which makes the Transvaal's most onerous demand 
seem light. 

Presumably any new information 
about so genial and engaging a per- 
sonality as that of Charles Lamb must 
be acceptable to the host of those who love the man, 
for his life as well as for his essays ; but the new facts 
which Mr. William Carew Hazlitt reveals in his 
little volume on " Lamb and Hazlitt " (Dodd, Mead 
& Co.) are neither of any great importance, nor 
are they told in such fashion as to stir any very 
lively interest. The special student will be glad to 
piece the little revelations of the book into a fuller 
knowledge of the man, but the general reader will 
find the volume disjointed and occasionally obscure. 
The same fault is observable in that part of the 
book which has to do with Hazlitt. A reader igno- 
rant of the fact that he was divorced from his first 
wife would hardly know what to make of the chap- 
ter dealing with that unfortunate production, the 
" Liber Amoris "; and to those familiar with the 
circumstances it will seem a little strange that one 
of the name should dwell at length upon an occur- 
rence so little to the credit of him who gives the 
name its distinction. But as the book is meant 
largely for the special student, these criticisms are 
perhaps captious. It does contain no small amount 
of interesting matter hitherto unpublished. There 
is an account of a joke perpetrated upon Hazlitt 
by Lamb and his friend Joseph Hume, and Lamb's 
characteristic humor sparkles in the pages of the 
correspondence which grew out of it. In mechan- 
ical execution the book is attractive, with its de- 
lightfully wide margins, heavy paper, artistic letter- 
press, and binding severely simple.

Englishmen in the Malayan Peninsula. For once, 
the selfishness of modern markets has been subor- 
dinated to measures purely philanthropic, while the 
impossibility of turning the Moslem natives to some 
other form of religion has left the civil administra- 
tors unhampered by the complications which mis- 
sionaries generally contrive to interject into the 
ordinary difficulties. Along with all the other ex- 
cellences of the resulting system has gone a care 
for science such as has marked the colonial admin- 
istration of the French and Germans to a far greater 
extent than that of the British up to this point. As 
proof of this may be cited the newly published vol- 
ume on " Malay Magic " (Macmillan), a most 
imposing monument to the industry of its author 



and compiler, Mr. Walter William Skeat, not the 
distinguished Cambridge professor of that name, 
but a member of the civil service of the Federated 
Malay States. Profiting by all the labors of many 
diligent predecessors, and adding to those the re- 
sults of his own investigations, Mr. Skeat presents 
an amount of material which must serve as a basis 
for many scholarly treatises, the more useful 
from his habit of recording facts without attempt- 
ing to account for them. The numerous formulae 
and superstitions embodied in this imposing volume 
are most curious survivals of paganry in a Moslem 
community, and are destined to early extinction 
through the spreading of intelligence now going on. 

Frequently a book is more interest- 
?" % *<>* *e glimpse it gives of the 
author's character, poise, and view, 
than for its matter. Mrs. Louise Jordan Miln's 
" Little Folks of many Lands " (Scribner) is one of 
that kind. It is written by a woman who says that 
she has supported herself by work in two profes- 
sions, and could do so again if necessary. Mrs. 
Miln has been an actor and a newspaper writer ; 
she has travelled ; she is independent, bright, sym- 
pathetic, and fearless. The book is interesting, but 
wearies if taken in long sittings. The author loves 
children, and delights in saying so. It is almost 
evident that she does not love all children, though 
she tries to make herself believe that she does. She 
describes children of many races and peoples, of 
varying colors and characters, from all zones. 
Those children whom she has really seen and known, 
she describes interestingly ; but those whom she 
knows by reading, or by dim memory, she breaks 
down on. Thus, her chapters about little Hindus, 
Ceylonese, and Chinese are charming ; but those 
about the Eskimo, American Indian, and Mexican 
(i. e., Vera Cruzan) children are tedious. Mrs. 
Miln has gathered a remarkable collection of child- 
pictures from all parts of the globe. They are used 
as illustrations in the book, and are interesting. 
" Little Folks of Many Lands " will interest and 
amuse ; it will kindle sympathy. It is not good 
ethnology, but it is suggestive. Anyone with human 
feeling and a soul, who knows other peoples and 
other lands, will delight in Mrs. Miln's keen but 
entirely justified thrusts at missionary meddling and 
foreign education among remote and " lower " 
peoples.

from Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co., in a hand- 
some little volume entitled " Indian Story and 
Song." The author, Mrs. Alice Fletcher, has long 
been known as an authority on Indian folk-lore, and 
her work is characterized by thorough accuracy as 
well as the sympathy such study demands, and of 
which it is really the life principle. Some twenty 
stories or legends are given, with their accompany- 
ing songs in musical notation. That the music is of

hardly more than elementary order, is naturally to 
be expected. But it will be very interesting to the 
musician, nevertheless, and there is a pathetic quality 
in much of it which gives unexpected light as to the 
emotional nature of the Indian. It is Mrs. Fletch- 
er's own belief that in the motives of these songs 
and stories, simple and naive as they are, will be 
found themes worthy the attention of the American 
composer. They were given at the Trans- American 
Exposition at Omaha in July, 1898, a number of 
Omaha Indians singing their native melodies to an 
audience of trained musicians. Thus far only the 
ethnological journals have had any record of Mrs. 
Fletcher's long and patient work, and her little vol- 
ume is a most welcome addition to our native folk- 
lore, a matter of increasing interest year by year.

the sanctum. rr , . _ 

States at Hong Kong in 189 < , he 
was editor of " The Overland Monthly " in San 
Francisco. Though he has since been made consul- 
general in that important post, and in addition to 
his regular duties has contrived to relieve himself 
of the responsibility for the American alliance with 
Aguinaldo, Mr. Wildman 's thoughts go back to his 
journalistic career with evident longing. His expe- 
riences, sublimed by time and a somewhat tropical 
imagination, now appear in a volume entitled " As 
Talked in the Sanctum" (Lothrop). This is a 
book wherein the curious in such matters may find 
disclosed some of the more esoteric features of con- 
ducting a magazine. As is usual in such cases, the 
editor has a number of friends who are perfectly will- 
ing to show him how such a periodical ought to be 
conducted, and the conversations which ensue are 
directed to that end. These are frequently bright, 
and often not so bright; but they may serve for 
instruction when dullest and for entertainment at 
other times. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



One of the most charming books that have recently 
issued from the press is that in which the Century Co. 
have reproduced Mr. Ernest Seton-Thompson's " Biog- 
raphy of a Grizzly." It is not quite safe to call any 
writing a classic that is only a year old, but we feel 
reasonably confident that this piece of sympathetic de- 
lineation of animal life will have a longer life than 
most books. The illustrations by the author, and the 
decorative designs by his talented wife, present many 
unusual and even startling effects, but they are unfail- 
ingly artistic in their feeling, and no less important than 
the text in accounting for the attractiveness of the book. 

Two new volumes have lately been added to the 
Columbia University Studies in History, Economics, 
and Public Law. Volume X. consists of three studies, 
treating of very diverse subjects, namely, sympathetic 
strikes and lockouts, the attitude of Rhode Island 
toward the adoption of the Constitution, and the cen- 
tralized administration of liquor laws in the United 
States. Volume XI. is devoted entirely to a statistical 



study of the growth of cities during the present cen- 
tury. Of these studies, the most interesting is the one 
relating to Rhode Island, written by Mr. Frank Greene 
Bates, now assistant professor of history in Alfred Uni- 
versity. A review of the early history of that State 
shows how persecution had aroused a fierce spirit of 
independence, and how an apparently well-grounded 
fear of absorption by the larger and more powerful 
States impelled resistance to the formation of a stronger 
federal government. 

Professor E. D. Starbuck's work on " The Psychology 
of Religion" (imported by Scribner) is the first notable 
attempt on any large scale to study statistically such 
phenomena as conversion, and to correlate them with 
other phases of mental evolution. While much that is 
merely commonplace is the result, yet the work has 
considerable value and interest as taking a stand against 
Sidis and others who consider all religious phenomena 
as abnormal. Professor Starbuek shows with scientific 
clearness that such a religious manifestation as conver- 
sion has its normal place in the mental and physical 
changes in adolescence, and is a deep-seated social phe- 
nomenon. The work is one which ought to be read dis- 
criminatingly by parents, teachers, and ministers. 

" The Poetical Works of John Milton," edited for 
the Oxford Clarendon Press by the Rev. H. C. Beeching, 
offers us in a single handsome volume a text carefully 
reprinted from the earliest published copies of the sev- 
eral poems. This means that the old spelling and 
punctuation have been preserved, except for the correc- 
tion of obvious misprints. The editor makes an elabo- 
rate defense of this decision, but we are sure that most 
scholars and general readers will applaud what he has 
done, and find the defense quite unnecessary. The most 
interesting feature of the present edition is its repro- 
duction of the " Minor Poems " of 1645, which has never 
before been reprinted in the original spelling. By way 
of illustrations we are provided with specimens of Mil- 
ton's manuscript and with facsimiles of all the original 
title-pages. 

" The Albion Series," to be published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co., " will comprise the most important Anglo- 
Saxon and Middle English poems in editions designed 
to meet the wants of both the scholar and the student." 
The initial volume of this series is " The Christ of Cyne- 
wulf," edited by Professor Albert S. Cook. Professor 
Cook has already done a considerable amount of pre- 
vious work upon this poem, and has made some impor- 
tant discoveries in connection with its sources. The 
edition consists of an elaborate introduction, a text 
based upon the standard readings, a large body of notes, 
and a glossary. It offers an important and substantial 
contribution to our Old English scholarship. 

Mr. James Hay's recent volume on Sir Walter Scott 
(Barnes) is a brief and very readable account of the 
great romancer's characteristics as man, author, scholar, 
advocate, and laird. Little attempt is made at a critical 
estimate of Scott's writings; and the chief value of the 
work lies in its biographical details, which are given in 
a manner to commend the book especially to younger 
readers. 

Dr. Smith's " Smaller History of Rome " (Harper) 
has done service in preparatory schools for many years, 
and it is now given a renewed lease of life in the revised 
edition prepared by Mr. A. H. J. Greenidge of Bras- 
enose College. The maps and many of the illustrations 
are new, and the text has been made to conform with 
the results of recent research.

NOTES. 

The " Birds of the Poets," published by Messrs. 
Brown & Co., is an interesting anthology edited by 
Miss Lucy F. Sanderson. It includes about a hundred 
selections, chiefly from American writers. 

" The Elements of International Law," by Colonel 
George B. Davis, has just been issued by the Messrs. 
Harper in a new and revised edition, making it better 
fitted than ever for the use of college classes, as well 
as for the general reader. 

"The Classical Mythology of Milton's English 
Poems," by Dr. Charles Grosvenor Osgood, is volume 
VIII. in the series of "Yale Studies in English," edited 
by Professor Albert S. Cook. Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co. are the publishers of this series. 

The Rev. Arthur Dimock is the author of a handbook 
to " The Cathedral Church of St. Paul " (Macmillan) 
published in "Bell's Cathedral Series." The author 
expresses warm approval of Sir William Richmond's 
mosaics, and makes contemptuous reference to the art- 
ists who have criticised the work. 

Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd's little book on "Total 
Eclipses of the Sun " (Little, Brown, & Co.), first pub- 
lished six years ago, now appears in a revised edition, 
with accounts of the eclipses of 1896 and 1898. Interest 
in the eclipse of the present month should stimulate many 
persons to read up the literature of the subject, and this 
work should prove welcome to them. 

Dr. George S. Keith is the author of two books of 
popular advice upon matters of health and hygiene, re- 
spectively entitled " Plea for a Simpler Life " and 
" Fads of an Old Physician." They are now republished, 
having enjoyed much vogue as separate volumes, bound 
within the same covers. The Macmillan Co. are Amer- 
ican agents for the publication. 

" Richard the Third up to Shakespeare," by Dr. 
George B. Churchill of Amherst College, is a monograph 
which comes to us from Messrs. Mayer & Miiller, 
Berlin. It constitutes Volume Ten in the series enti- 
tled " Palaestra," which consists of " Untersuchungen 
und Texte aus der Deutschen und Englischen Philo- 
logie," under the general editorship of Professors Alois 
Brandl and Erich Schmidt. It is written in English, 
and is a portly volume of between five and six hundred 
pages. 

"A Cumulative Index to the Books of 1898-99," 
compiled by Mr. M. E. Potter, and published by Mr. 
H. W. Wilson, Minneapolis, is a volume of over six 
hundred double-columned pages, and comprises under a 
single alphabet author, subject, and title references to 
the American publications of two years. About seven- 
teen thousand books are catalogued, and the usefulness 
of the work to booksellers and librarians does not need 
to be set forth. 

The American School of Classical Studies in Rome 
has issued its circular for the year 1900-1901. The 
school will be in charge of Mr. Richard Norton (being 
his fourth year of service), and Professor F. W. Kelsey 
will also be in residence, and give courses of instruction. 
Professor Elmer T. Merrill, Middletown, Conn., is at 
present in executive charge of the affairs of the School 
in this country, and will be glad to answer any inquiries 
that may be made of him. 

The last publication of the London Bibliographical 
Society is a quarto pamphlet containing a most useful 
" List of English Plays Written before 1643 and Printed 



before 1700." It is the work of Mr. W. W. Greg, of 
Trinity College, Cambridge. The plan of the handlist 
arranges the plays under the authors' names in alphabet- 
ical order; then under each playwright the collected edi- 
tions are given first, followed by the editions of separate 
plays in chronological order of the first dated editions. 
Anonymous plays are listed at the end. It is a great 
help to accurate studies to find the titles given in full, 
with the printer's name, the date, and the place of 
present possession. And in order to make the bibliog- 
raphy of the great drama complete, Mr. Greg has 
wisely included all the works of authors who are known 
to have written plays, whether extant or not, up to the 
closing of the theatres in 1642. Comparing this hand- 
list of English plays with Halliwell's antiquated " Dic- 
tionary of Old Plays," and the wheat and chaff of 
Fleay's valuable but exasperating "Chronicle of the 
English Drama," Mr. Greg's work is a distinct advance 
in bibliographical scholarship. It is admirably simple, 
concise, and businesslike, and withal modest. Not to 
look a gift horse too closely in the mouth, one might 
suggest that the list would be more useful if some de- 
vice had been adopted to make the titles stand out 
more clearly. Dates in the left-hand margin would 
arrest the eye, or a different type, especially for first 
editions. At. all events non-extant plays should have 
been printed in smaller type. So, also, the two indexes, 
of authors and of plays, would work better if paged. 
As it is, one must know the author's name to be able to 
find any particular play. Plays in manuscript, masques, 
pageants, and triumphs, and what are called, rather 
loosely, "unclassable productions," are purposely omitted 
with a view to a separate publication. The fact that 
Day's " Parliament of Bees " and Heywood's pastoral 
"Amphrisa" are classed as "unclassable," suggests 
vague gaps on closer study of Mr. Greg's list. A com- 
plete bibliography of the Elizabethan drama upon Mr. 
Greg's plan would be a desideratum: Mr. Greg could 
easily produce it by combining this first handlist with 
the one he promises.

A TWENTIETH CENTURY BOOK. 

About My Father's Business. 

The work treats of the present social conditions in 
the churches, showing the lack of force and power in 
spiritual life by the encroachment upon it of social 
pleasures; its reasons for failing to reach the masses; 
the abuses of power and influences on the part of some 
of its rich members, who frequently use the church as a 
cloak for the advancement of their selfish ambitions and 
designs. While the book has a religious flavor, at the 
same time it advances some very strong themes of 
morality and philosophy. You should read it.

MORE PRESS NOTICES 

As A contribution to the voluminous history of the Church 
of Rome during the early and middle period of the Christian 
era, this volume is of great value. . . . Mr. Wishart begins 
his account with a description of the orders of antiquity . . . 
and concludes it with a masterly account of the fall of the 
monasteries, of the causes and ideals of monasticism, and the 
effects upon the civilization of the time. . . . Mr. Wishart 
has been remarkably successful in his effort to produce a book 
on a subject of world-wide interest, which is marked by a 
commendable predilection for truth and justice. It contains 
the results of an exhaustive study and will not fail to attract 
wide attention and interest. Toronto Mail and Empire. 

Important and beautiful. The Literary World (Boston). 

One of the most fascinating of books. . . . No bare narra- 
tion of facts, but a captivating review of a subject which in 
itself is one of the most romantic and instructive in the annals 
of humanity. ... In every line there is marked freedom of 
thought, a vigorous raciness of style, a masterly grasp of the 
subject in all its relations, and a broadness of sympathy that 
is peculiarly welcome in the historian. . . . The mechanical 
make-up is beautiful . . . luxurious. Baptist Outlook 
(Buffalo). 

We cannot leave this review without speaking of Mr. 
Wishart's fairness in dealing with Henry VIII. 's conduct at 
the suppression of the monasteries. Buffalo Evening News. 

It is a most interesting recital Mr. Wishart makes. ... A 
handsome example of the printer's art. St. Louis Globe- 
Democrat. 

He has done his work exceptionally well. ... It is a work 
that should appeal to many readers. Troy Press. 

An orderly and lucid account of a most interesting phase 
of religious life. . . . Will be found most useful to those de- 
siring information in this connection. Chicago Times-Herald. 

The concluding portion is given to a discussion of the causes 
and ideals of monasticism, a discussion which is temperate, 
lucid, and far-reaching, and which admirably supplements the 
presentation of facts which has preceded it. The book is 
especially suited to the needs of the general reader desirous 
of obtaining a comprehensive view of the whole subject. . . . 
He will find it an ample setting forth of the monastic ideal 
and the means employed to realize it, together with the influ- 
ence of that ideal, in its apotheosis and its degeneration, on 
contemporary life. The literary style is simple and pleasing ; 
it is 'easy reading.' The publisher has given the book an 
elegant dress. Detroit Free Press.

Romance of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century 

BY MARY E WILKINS 

MISTRESS MARY CAVENDISH had a " tabby petticoat of a crimson color, 
and a crimson satin bodice shining over her arms and shoulders like the 
plumage of a bird, and down her back streamed her curls, shining like gold under 
her gauze love-hood." This young lady certainly lends charm to the opening of 
Miss Wilkins's first venture in the field of historical romance, nor does the rest of 
the story belie this auspicious beginning. The novel is designedly more subjective 
than most members of its class, but the development of personality is at no expense 
of movement or interest, the scene being laid just after Bacon's Rebellion, and a 
dramatic incident being the destruction of the young tobacco crop to elude the 

Navigation Act.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PUBLICATIONS 



CUMULATIVE BOOK INDEX. 

As a result of the Cumulative Plan subscribers re- 
ceive monthly a catalogue of all books published in the 
United States during the current year, completed, re- 
vised, and brought down to date each month. It is on 
the same plan as a card catalogue. The information, 
however, is kept on stereotypes instead of cards and 
the whole record is reprinted in book form each month. 
It is better than a card catalogue containing the same 
information because it can be consulted more quickly 
and is convenient and portable. 

During the whole year of 1900 it will be necessary 
to look in but one place for any current book. 

" We would ask you to please send us in the future three copies of 
the Cumulative Index instead of one for which we have subscribed. 
We sincerely trust that you are being sufficiently supported in the 
publication to warrant its continuance." 

CH AHLKS SCRIBNER'S SONS, New York.

The FOURTH Edition of the New Novel, 

VENGEANCE IS MINE 

By ANDREW BALFOUR, author of "By Stroke of Sword," "To Arms," etc., 

WILL BE BEADY IN A FEW DATS. 

Every reader will corroborate a Boston critic in the following opinion : 

" The book of the moment, ' Vengeance is Mine,' by Dr. Andrew Balfour, is one of the most dramatic novels 
of the present year. Although primarily an historic tale, the main thread of the narrative lies in the powerful 
love story that runs through the novel. The great value of the work to literature lies in Dr. Balfour's touch of 
art and his keen insight into human character. To every person in the story is given the breath of life and the 
charming magic of individuality. All the personalities are vivid creations of which any novelist could feel justly 
proud, and moreover the author is sincere and writes vigorous English. . . . We read of Napoleon on the Isle 
of Elba, and follow him and his eagles to Waterloo. It is a very thrilling story." Boston Times.

BOOKS FOR THE SUMMER. 



Bird Studies with a Camera 

With Introductory Chapters on the Outfit and Methods of the Bird Photographer. 

By FBANK M. CHAPMAN, Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Zoology in the American Museum of Natural 
History, author of " Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America " and of " Bird Life," with pic- 
tures by Ernest Seton-Thompson. Illustrated with over 100 photographs from nature by the author.

Bird students and photographers will find that this book possesses for them a unique interest and value. It 
contains fascinating accounts of the habits of some of our common birds and descriptions of the largest bird 
colonies existing in Eastern North America; while its author's phenomenal success in photographing birds in 
nature not only lends to the illustrations the charm of realism, but makes the book a record of surprising achieve- 
ments with the camera. This book is practical as well as descriptive, and in the opening chapters the questions 
of camera, lens, plates, blinds, decoys, and other pertinent matters are fully discussed. 



Miss Fowler's New Novel. 

The Farringdons. 

A Novel. By ELLEN THORNEYCROFT FOWLER, author 
of " Concerning Isabel Carnaby " and " A Double 
Thread." Second Edition. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Of all the charms of Miss Fowler's books, the greatest 
perhaps is that her characters are all alive ; they are people 
of real flesh and blood, whom it is a delight to know through 
the medium of her pages and to remember long afterward. 
It is always venturesome to draw comparisons, and the re- 
spective merits of "The Farringdons" and of Miss Fowler's 
earlier works had perhaps best be left to popular verdict, but 
it is safe to predict that a large proportion of readers will de- 
clare in favor of the new work." New York Commercial 
Advertiser.

EUGENE MCCARTHY. With an Introduction by Dr.

This interesting and practical book describes the 
habits and environment of trout, salmon, bass, perch, pike,

interest all who care for nature study, is supplemented 
by a most useful explanation of fly-casting, rods, tackle, 
methods of fishing, camping outfits, and a variety of

THEORY AND PRACTICE. 

Not long ago there was published in " The 
Atlantic Monthly " an account of " The Per- 
plexities of a College President," which proved 
to be an exceptionally entertaining contribu- 
tion to recent educational literature. The pub- 
lication was anonymous, for reasons that became 
obvious as one read the article. Had it pro- 
vided entertainment and nothing more, it would 
not now concern us ; but its easy and pictur- 
esque style served as the vehicle for a theory 
of educational administration that we are bound 
to characterize as both perverse and pernicious, 
and that deserves to be disentangled from the 
plausible rhetoric in which it was set forth. 
The writer introduced his subject with an 
elaborate parallel, filling two pages of the mag- 
azine, between an old-fashioned stage coach and 
a modern university. The stage coach was 
drawn by an ill-assorted team of six horses, was 
itself of antique pattern, and had for passengers 
a crowd of light-hearted young fellows who knew 
that the coach was run for them and thought 
that it ought to be run by them. There was an 
untried driver, the coach had been repainted, 
and the directors of the company were on hand 
to witness the start under these new conditions. 
All this is supposed to be a sort of parable. 
The coach and its driver are a university with 
a new president, the team is the faculty, and 
the directors are well, they are the directors 
or trustees. The lesson to be conveyed is that, 
given a faculty whose members are at cross- 
purposes with one another, and a board of 
trustees who represent various degrees of ignor- 
ance and conservatism, the best president in 
the world cannot develope the work of his uni- 
versity in accordance with the modern demand 
for progress, efficiency, and unity of aim. The 
theory of the writer is thus expressed : 

" When the directors of a great commercial corpor- 
ation or of some transportation company find it necessary 
to call a new man to the presidency or to the position 
of general manager, he is at once given almost absolute 
authority as to all executive details. The Board of 
Control determines the general policy of the company, 
always after counselling with the new president or man- 
ager, and then leaves the executive to carry out this 
policy his success or failure determining the wisdom 
of their choice of the man." 

The commercial analogy thus drawn is devel- 



426 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



oped in much detail. The two chief points 
which the writer makes are that it is the pres- 
ident's duty to dismiss all the men who are not 
likely to act in full sympathy with his ideas of 
university management, and, having secured a 
harmonious faculty by the combined processes 
of expulsion and replacement, to carry out his 
own policy without calling the "employees" into 
consultation. That this statement of the writ- 
er's theory, monstrous as it seems, is not an 
unfair one, may be shown from his own words : 
"The same rule ought to apply here as elsewhere: 
one who cannot commend himself to a wisely chosen 
and properly restrained executive, one who cannot cor- 
dially and enthusiastically cooperate with such an exec- 
utive along lines of policy determined by the authorities 
of the university, ought to go elsewhere and ought 
not to stand upon the order of his going, either." 

So much for the first of the writer's two funda- 
mental propositions ; for the second the follow- 
ing quotation will suffice : 

" If the manager of a cotton factory should under- 
take to determine by the vote of all employees where 
to buy raw material, when to buy, in what quantities to 
buy, what prices to pay, with what pattern or in what 
form or in what quantities to manufacture, when and 
where and on what terms to sell, he would bankrupt his 
corporation in a single year. 

The philistine idea of a university thus out- 
lined is already too widely current among the 
unthinking masses of our people, and this latest 
argument in its behalf should not pass without 
a protest. When the New York "Nation" 
described the article as " conceived in the spirit 
and couched in the style of the educational 
drummer," the characterization was not un- 
duly severe. And a correspondent of that 
journal speaks only the barest truth when he 
declares that he has never seen a " more mis- 
chievous attempt to lower the high ideal of 
what a college should be." If we reflect upon 
that exalted conception of the spirit and pur- 
pose of an institution for the higher education 
which has found expression in the writings of 
so many serious thinkers in Newman's " The 
Idea of a University," for example we are 
brought to a forcible realization of the contrast 
between their inspiring messages and the igno- 
ble teaching of the writer now under consider- 
ation. A university, in Newman's view, is a 
place of " living teaching, which in course of 
time will take the shape of a self-perpetuating 
tradition, or a genius loci, as it is sometimes 
called ; which haunts the home where it has 
been born, and which imbues and forms, more 
or less, and one by one, every individual who 
is successively brought under its shadow." A 
university, in the view of that "one of the 



guild " who now contemptuously rejects all the 
notions of old-fashioned culture, is an institu- 
tion something like an insurance company, 
having a corps of " employees " whose duty it 
is to give unquestioning obedience to the orders 
of the manager, and to unite with him in set- 
ting a " hot pace " in the competition with 
rival establishments. The writer states with 
indignation the fact that he knows of a new 
university president against whom it was once 
actually scored " that his methods were too com- 
mercial," and he quotes for condemnation the 
words, " He is attempting to run the univer- 
sity precisely as he would run a woollen factory," 
in which a member of the faculty complained 
of that new president. 

To put the matter bluntly, our writer is evi- 
dently of the opinion of a fellow-president 
whom he represents as "fully assured in his 
own mind that if it were possible to dismiss 
immediately every member of every faculty east 
of the Alleghanies, not more than one half 
would be reinstated, and he doubted if more 
than one third would be." Yet he complains 
in the same paragraph that "positive teaching 
power is still a rare gift," and that "there are 
not yet enough strong men to go around." 
Does he imagine that the number of strong 
men available would be greatly increased, say 
twenty years from now, if the power of arbi- 
trary dismissal which he advocates were to be 
held and exercised by any considerable number 
of college presidents? The dignity of the pro- 
fession and the security of the tenure consti- 
tute the chief reasons which now persuade an 
able man to choose the educational calling; 
these are what compensate him in part for the 
sacrifices that he must make ; for these consid- 
erations he scorns the delights of material pros- 
perity and lives the laborious days of the teacher 
and investigator. Anything that weakens se- 
curity of tenure in the teaching profession at 
once tends to lower its standard besides dealing 
a fatal blow to its dignity. 

It is not often that a theoretical .discussion 
finds so apt an illustration as is provided in this 
case by the affairs of the University of Cincin- 
nati. At about the time when this defense of 
the commercial method of university adminis- 
tration was on its way through the press, the 
method was being put into actual practice in 
the institution just named. Last summer the 
University of Cincinnati, having long been 
without a president, obtained one from a neigh- 
boring State, and a few months later this new 
incumbent of the position startled the commu- 



1900.] 



THE DIAL,

nity by an arbitrary demand for the resignation 
of nearly all the members of the faculty. The 
Directors of the University stood behind the 
executive in this action, although it was taken 
in defiance of the by-laws and before the new 
executive could have made any real acquaint- 
ance with the work of his associates. The 
men thus summarily dismissed included several 
scholars of long service and high distinction, 
whose work had been uniformly commended for 
many years in the annual reports of the Direc- 
tors. This high-handed proceeding aroused 
public indignation to such an extent that great 
numbers of the most respected citizens rallied 
to the defense of the faculty, and sought to 
obtain, if not a reversal of the action, at least 
a definite statement of the grounds upon which 
it was taken. The Citizens' Committee was 
composed of men of such standing that its pro- 
test was entitled to the most respectful consid- 
eration. This consideration it can hardly be 
said to have obtained, and its efforts have re- 
sulted neither in the restoration of the instruct- 
ors dismissed, nor even in any defense of the 
act which is deserving of serious consideration. 
From the report of the Committee, which is 
signed by such men as Rabbi Philipson and 
the Rev. Charles F. Goss, we extract the follow- 
ing sentences : 

" It has been clearly established by incontrovertible 
testimony that these reputable citizens, learned men, 
competent professors, courteous gentlemen, and life- 
long promoters of the educational interests of our city 
were, without previous notice, roughly summoned 
by the janitor of the building to repair at once to the 
President's private office, where, in the presence of a 
stenographer to record what was said and in the absence 
of other witnesses to the interview, an imperious 
demand was made that they at once attach their signa- 
tures to already prepared resignations. . . . When the 
surprised aud mortified victims pleaded for a little time 
in which to consider the matter, they were promptly 
informed that unless the prepared resignations were 
signed, sealed, and delivered before five p. M. on the 
following day, they would be disgraced by a summary 
and unconditional dismissal, which he stated he had 
been empowered to enforce. . . . Finally, when such 
threats failed to terrify into subservient submission and 
abject surrender, his threats were turned to pleadings 
and promises that if they would sign and preserve abso- 
lute secrecy in regard to the whole matter he would give 
them the aid of his commendation and powerful influence 
in obtaining appointments elsewhere an offer whose 
ethical nature will scarcely bear investigation. . . . 
This by a man who has never had a meeting of his fac- 
ulty for the purpose of considering or discussing condi- 
tions, outlining his policy, or in any shape or form indi- 
cating a desire for changes of any character or kind; a 
man who has never visited any of the class rooms, heard 
a single recitation, or taken any means whatever toward 
making himself acquainted with the workings of the 
University." 



These statements constitute a sufficiently 
scathing denunciation of a proceeding which 
must be viewed with apprehension by all who 
are concerned with the best interests of the 
higher education. Such star-chamber methods 
are absolutely indefensible, and should excite 
widespread indignation. " Under the absolute 
despotism of the present administration," says 
one of the professors whose resignations were 
demanded, " the faculty has ceased to be a free 
deliberative body, and its rightful prerogatives 
have been disregarded in respect to great uni- 
versity questions." That such conditions as 
these should be possible in any American uni- 
versity offers an alarming indication of a ten- 
dency to depart from those principles of univer- 
sity management which are essential to the 
wellbeing of every institution of learning. The 
testimony of Professor P. V. N. Myers, who 
was not dismissed, but who promptly added his 
own resignation to those which had been forced 
from his colleagues, deserves also to be given. 
The scholarship and the character of Professor 
Myers need no defense, and his words carry 
with them much weight. He says : 

" As a believer in the eternal justice of God, and as 
a teacher of the supremacy of the law of righteousness 
in human life and history, I cannot consent to work with 
President Ayers, as he has asked me to do, in carrying 
on the future work of the University, since by o doing, 
I should be giving approval to the professional assassi- 
nation I cannot use a less accusing word by a compar- 
ative stranger, of my colleagues of many years, some of 
whom I have come to know intimately, and through such 
knowledge have acquired the right to declare that in 
their persons has been violated every principle of hu- 
manity and justice. . . . For me to remain as a teacher 
in the University under the administration so unhappily 
inaugurated would be to undo the work of my past life, 
and to impart a false note to all my instructions I have 
ever held up before the young men and young women to 
whom I have had the privilege and honor to stand in the 
relation of teacher, friend, and guide, as the loftiest ideal 
of conduct, unswerving fidelity to conscience and the 
dictates of duty. I have told them never to follow ex- 
pediency, but ever fearlessly to follow close after right 
and justice, regardless of consequences. If I, myself, 
as I now stand at a parting of ways, should falter and 
fail to act in accordance with my own teachings, should 
hesitate, because of the pain and sacrifice that the act 
involves, to set my feet in the path which is plainly the 
path of honor and of duty, how could I ever again tell 
the young of the regnancy of conscience, of the majesty 
of the eternal laws of righteousness, of the divineness 
and inviolability of justice, save in words that would 
ring hollow as sounding brass? " 

No technical rejoinder, no amount of sophis- 
tical reasoning, can avail against the force of 
this sincere and dignified utterance, supported, 
as it is, by the respected personality of its 
distinguished writer.

MEMOIRS OF ALEXANDER I. AND 
HIS COURT.* 



The Memoir of the Countess Choiseul- 
Gouffier enjoyed a well-merited vogue in its 
day, three-quarters of a century ago, running 
rapidly through two liberal editions, which have 
now, as we learn, shrunk to the spectral dimen- 
sions of a brace of copies, one of them in the 
British Museum, the other in the possession of 
the translator of the comely volume now before 
us. Time has not materially dulled the interest 
or staled the variety of Madame Choiseul- 
Gouffier's picturesque and substantial little 
book ; and we are glad to see it thus revived 
in a form which should give it a fresh lease of 
life with a new public. The portrait it paints 
of Alexander I., while not strictly in accord 
with the wider verdict of history, has its spe- 
cial features of truth and grace ; while the 
charm and animation of the author's pictures 
of the events she saw and the circles she moved 
in are undeniable. 

The Countess de Choiseul-Gouffier, nee de 
Tisenhaus, was a Polish lady of rank, who was 
born at Vilna in Lithuania toward the close of 
the eighteenth century. Of her earlier life the 
Memoir tells us little, its burden being the 
writer's personal recollections of Alexander I. 
during the dozen or so years of her acquaint- 
ance with him. That acquaintance began in 
1812 at Vilna, on the eve of Napoleon's inva- 
sion of Russia, of which ill-starred enterprise 
the Countess may be said in a way to have wit- 
nessed the opening and the close. Alexander 
had set up his military headquarters at Vilna, 
out of compliment perhaps to his Lithuanian 
subjects, whose loyalty showed signs of waver- 
ing before the allurements held out by Napoleon 
to the quenchless sentiment of Polish national- 
ism. 

The Countess first met Alexander at Towiany, 
the beautiful country-seat of Count Moriconi, 
near Vilna, where the Emperor stayed over 
night on returning from a review. Of this, to 
her, memorable evening spent at Towiany the 
author gives a vivacious account filled with 
instances of the Imperial guest's winning affa- 
bility and natural good breeding. Alexander, 
she notes especially, had an infinity of shades

COURT OF RUSSIA. By Mme. La Comtesse de Choiseul-Gouf- 
fier. Translated from the French by Mary Berenice Patter- 
son. With portraits. Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co. 



of tone and manner, each nicely adapted to the 
station or character of the person addressed. 

" When he addressed men of distinguished rank, it 
was with dignity and affability at the same time; to 
persons of his retinue, with an air of kindness almost 
familiar; to women of a certain age, with deference; 
and to young people with an infinite grace, a refined 
and attractive manner, and a countenance full of ex- 
pression." 

Shortly after this meeting at Towiany the 
Countess had an opportunity of observing a 
potentate not born to the purple, who impressed 
her much less favorably than Alexander. Hos- 
tilities between France and Russia began, and 
the Russian policy of continuous retreat was 
determined on. As the French approached 
Vilna the Russians evacuated it, without firing 
a shot, much to the chagrin of Bonaparte, who 
divined what his easy victory portended. Dur- 
ing his stay at Vilna Napoleon " exacted " a 
presentation of the ladies of the district at the 
castle. His manners, according to the Countess, 
savored more of the barrack and the canteen 
than of the drawing-room. 

" At the same presentation, Napoleon, after having 
spoken to several ladies, and, according to his custom, 
asking singular questions, < Are you married ? How 
many children have you ? Are they big and fat, hey ? ' 
addressed the whole circle and said: 'The Emperor 
Alexander is exceedingly amiable, he has gained all 
hearts here ; are you good Poles ? ' A general smile 
served as response." 

Napoleon, the author states, had nothing im- 
posing in his face or manners. 

" I was astonished not to feel in his presence that 
emotion which one usually cannot prevent at the sight 
of a celebrated personage. All that glory bought with 
the price of men and blood could not inspire me with 
enthusiasm. The glory of conquerors is made to shine 
in history, but it is goodness alone which conquers the 
hearts of men. I had often pictured to myself the face 
of Napoleon with a countenance (sz'c) sparkling with 
genius. What was my surprise and disappointment on 
seeing only a little, short, fat, waddling man, with 
sleek, plastered-down hair, with good enough features 
but little expression in his face, not even that of hard- 
ness which is found in all the portraits, with the excep- 
tion of that by David. On the contrary, there was 
something pleasant in his smile, which showed very 
handsome teeth. From a distance, I confess, his sal- 
low, white face without a tinge of color, and his antique 
profile, took on a character of severity, which disap- 
peared as soon as it was examined near." 

The author saw the entry into Vilna of the 
French army, then flushed with the anticipa- 
tion of victory and spoil ; and she saw rem- 
nants of it return there, after famine, the 
snow, and the Cossacks had done their work. 

" During three or four days the streets of Vilna were 
filled again with a throng of men, I cannot say soldiers, 
since it was impossible to recognize them in that char- 



1900.]

acter under the grotesque garments which covered 
them. One had thrown away his helmet and was muf- 
fled up in a woman's velvet hood and black satin mantle, 
under which you could see his spurs. Another had 
wrapped himself in the ornaments and vestments of a 
church, stoles, chasubles, and altar-cloths all piled upon 
another to keep out the cold, from which nothing could 
really protect the men. Others, more fortunate in their 
booty, had thrown about their shoulders ladies' fur 
dressing-gowns, with the sleeves tied about their necks. 
Others, again, trailed woolen blankets after them, or, 
like shades from that place whence one never returns, 
advanced in grave-clothes and winding-sheets." 

After the re-taking of Vilna by the Russians 
there were scenes still more harrowing. 

" We could not stir into the streets without encount- 
ering the dead bodies of French soldiers, either frozen 
to death or murdered by the Jews, who had killed them 
to get their watches, money, or other articles which 
they had about them. . . . Jewish women and even 
children were seen robbing the dead soldiers, or if they 
were not quite dead, killing them by kicks with their 
iron-bound shoes." 

The imperial author of all this misery had 
passed close by Vilna on his return to France. 
The Duke of Bassano, who had seen him, spoke, 
says the author, " to me of it the same day, and 
said he had found the emperor very well and 
cheerful" 

" Napoleon breakfasted near Vilna, almost at the 
gates, chatting and joking with the members of his suite 
and with the Duke of Bassano, while the postilion who 
had driven his horses fell frozen to death." 

A fortnight after the retaking of Vilna by 
the Russians the Emperor Alexander returned 
there, and during his stay the author had sev- 
eral conversations with him, which she recounts. 
On one occasion he observed : 

" I am badly seconded in my views for the happi- 
ness of my people, in fact, sometimes I should like to 
break my head against the wall, on seeing myself sur- 
rounded by such egotists, who neglect the good and the 
interests of the State, and think only of their own for- 
tune and elevation." 

After her marriage to M. Choiseul-Gouffier, 
cosmopolite, savant, and erstwhile favorite of 
Paul I., the author resided for the most part at 
Paris, revisiting, however, the North from time 
to time and renewing her acquaintance with her 
imperial hero. Her conversations with him are 
faithfully recorded ; and although she notes 
symptoms of the mental change that darkened 
his later years, and was so unhappily reflected 
in his policy at home and abroad, there is no 
abatement of the note of perf ervid loyalty and 
admiration that pervades her recollections. She 
accepts without question Alexander's explana- 
tion of his abandonment of the cause of the 
Greek insurgents. 

" I cannot, and I will not (said the Emperor), favor 
the insurrection of the Greeks, because that step would 



be contrary to the system which I have adopted, and it 
would certainly destroy that peace which 1 have tried 
so hard to establish, a peace so necessary to Europe." 

A "peace," the countess might justly have 
added, which would have been for the peoples 
as the peace of death ; for it would have been 
founded in the strangling of every popular and 
national aspiration, and the complete restoration 
of the old social, political, and spiritual order. 
The " system " adopted by Alexander after the 
Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle was indeed one 
which precluded him from aiding the struggling 
Greeks, and thus obeying whatever remnants 
of the generous and liberalizing impulses of 
his youth he may still have retained. The 
promise of that youth was ill-fulfilled by later 
years. The erstwhile pupil of la Harpe, the 
philanthropic prince who had dreamed of free- 
ing and educating his people and spreading the 
light and warmth of the " new ideas " through- 
out his benighted and despot-ridden empire, 
gradually sank, as we know, into the gloomy 
and distrustful tyrant, the dupe of Metternich 
and Nesselrode, the champion of all that was 
reactionary and repressive in Europe. Des- 
potism, said de Maistre, " breathed from his 
nostrils." He died at Taganrog in 1825, half- 
demented, worn out by physical excesses, beset 
by the strangest fancies, unlamented by the 
people who had hailed his accession as the dawn 
of a new and glorious era for Russia. And yet 
those immediately attached to his person loved 
him to the last. After his death, his old ser- 
vant Ilia clung to his remains with dog-like 
fidelity, following them from Taganrog to St. 
Petersburg, " and every night, in spite of the 
intense cold and his advanced age, he slept on 
the hearse which carried the precious relic." 

Madame Choiseul-Gouffier's portrait of Al- 
exander is, while partial and incomplete, un- 
questionably faithful as far as it goes, and it 
contains elements of truth which must be reck- 
oned with in forming a well-rounded conception 
of his complex and enigmatic character a 
character compounded of strangely assorted 
and often contradictory qualities. Madame 
Choiseul-Gouffier painted Alexander as she saw 
him, adding little or nothing on the credit of 
hearsay ; and as much may perhaps be said, 
though less confidently, of another female me- 
moirist of the Czar, Madame de Kriidener, who 
also supplied to the sum total of biographical 
facts her quota of special truths. In Madame 
de Kriidener's pages it is the visionary Alex- 
ander, the mystic pietist, and founder of the 
politico-religious Holy Alliance, that is set be-

fore us; Madame Choiseul-Gouffier paints 
rather the amiable and reforming prince, who 
joins to the bearing due to the dignity of his 
station that habitual deference to the claims 
and sensibilities of others which stamps the 
well-bred gentleman. History, noting chiefly 
in Alexander I. those traits which bore most 
directly and powerfully upon the course of 
public events, regards him in the main as the 
leader of the reaction against the first wave of 
European democracy, the relentless foe of " the 
ideas of '89." 

We are glad, as we have already said, to 
find this interesting little book revived in a 
form that should give it a new lease of popu- 
larity. It forms a useful foot-note to the his- 
tory of the period. The translation is made 
from the first edition, and therefore contains 
the first three chapters, treating of the assas- 
sination of Paul I., which were omitted from 
the second one. The translator and editor ap- 
pears to have done her work accurately and 
carefully, only a few minor slips being apparent, 
for instance, a rather disastrous misprint (""sol- 
itude " instead of solicitude) on page 302, and 
the statement in the Index that the execution 
of the Due d'Enghien took place in Baden. 
The volume is tastefully gotten up throughout,

THE FOUR BEST PL.A.TS OF 
HAUPTMANN.* 



Some time ago, in writing of the plays of 
Mr. Bernard Shaw, I said that it was next to 
impossible to see, among other plays, " Die 
Versunkene Glocke," by Gerhart Hauptmann. 
At that time the play had been given in this 
country only for a short time, in New York, by 
Frau Sorma in German. Now, however, it has 
been presented in English. When first pre- 
sented in German, in this country, it was said 
that there was "nothing for the stage" in it. 
But Mr. Sothern seems to have thought other- 
wise, and the criticisms on his opening night 
in New York rather bore him out : several 
years of theatrical success had had a mellowing

effect on a judgment originally a little harsh. 
Whatever the play may have for the stage, 
certainly the stage has something for the play. 

Now that it will soon be possible (it is to be 
hoped) for everyone to see this play, which 
some call Hauptmann's masterpiece, it is a good 
time to note that a translation of it, by Mr. 
C. L. Meltzer, was published last year, as well 
as an excellent annotated edition which will be 
of help to those who like to read the play in 
German. There are also translations by Miss 
Mary Morison of " Einsame Menschen " and 
" Die Weber." There is also a translation of 
" Hanneles Himmelfahrt " by Mr. Archer, 
which, I believe, has not been republished in 
this country. It is therefore easily possible 
for anyone to know Hauptmann's four best 
plays. And these plays are not only his best, 
but they are fortunately representative of the 
different directions of his work. He is an 
original man, and his things are by no means 
all of the same kind. 

In fact, it is proper to say that one of the 
noteworthy features of " The Sunken Bell" is 
that it is quite unlike the rest of Hauptmann's 
work. He has written eleven plays. Of these, 
the first was said, by those who did not like it, 
to out-Zola Zola ; and the same thing might also 
have been said of the second. The third was 
" Einsame Menschen " (translated under the 
title of " Lonely Lives "), which is not so much 
like Zola as it is like Ibsen. Without laying 
much stress on the question of influence 
Zola and Ibsen were almost unescapable influ- 
ences ten years ago we may say that these 
first plays were realistic plays, plays in which 
the chief interest was in the characters, plays 
which uncovered some of the tragic possibilities 
of contemporary psychology. The first two 
were crude pictures of manners rather than 
anything else : plays of solicitous motive, char- 
acter, dialogue, but hardly developed into the 
coherence needed for tragedy. " Einsame 
Menschen " was more of a true drama : it 
brought together its dramatic possibilities into 
an intense focus, without losing anything of the 
realistic truth of character. The next three 
plays were realistic also. Two of them (" Der 
Biberpelz " and " College Crampton ") are of 
minor interest. " Die Weber " (" The Weav- 
ers") , however, was Hauptmann's first great suc- 
cess. It certainly was a remarkable piece, and 
must be well known by those who would know 
the man. But although in dramatic technique 
it is very different from the plays which had 
gone before, it is not different in spirit. It is 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



431 



different in dramatic technique because it has 
no especial action and has no particular char- 
acters. Of course, something takes place, and 
certain people appear more than once ; but the 
centre of interest is not in the individuals, it is 
in the general movement. The play presents 
the rise and failure of a strike among the 
weavers ; and if the full significance of the 
movement be gained, the fate of particular 
weavers is of minor moment. This surely is a 
great departure from the fairly well-ordered 
tragedy of " Einsame Menschen." Still, the 
two plays are the same in general method : 
both are realistic in manner. The next plays 
had still further differences : " Hannele " was 
called " a dream-poem," " Florian Geyer " was 
an historical drama in verse. But in both 
Hauptmann was still realistic, if we may indi- 
cate by that word that he was still absorbed 
largely in seeing how men and women actually 
do live and act. True, he chose out-of-the-way 
fields, fields which stretch over toward the do- 
main of romance. Hannele is a poor little girl 
driven by cruelty to an attempt at suicide. 
She is rescued and carried to the poorhouse, 
where she sees strange and beautiful visions 
before she dies. Vision and reality are some- 
times so intermingled that one does not know 
whether the stage represents the poorhouse 
room or the disordered brain of the dying child. 
Often, too, we may think that we have not 
realism, but poetry. But there is never a place 
in the play where we can deny that Haupt- 
mann's chief interest was in watching the rise 
and fall of the faint little flame of life in its 
last flickerings before absorption or extinction. 
And " Florian Geyer," too, although historical, 
although cast in the romantic period of mediae- 
val ism, was still an attempt to get at life, to 
figure a period of social ferment and unrest not 
unlike our own. 

In fact, in these eight plays we see a realist 
too large and too genuine to be bound by any 
simple formula, turning from one motive to 
another, from one time to another, from one 
phase of life to another, but always recognizing 
the limits of particular cases, always selecting 
some individual forms wherein motive and 
phase and time had actually manifested them- 
selves, always presenting these particulars with 
the strictest adherence to the laws of fact and 
the necessities of the special case which hap- 
pened to exhibit them. 

Now " Die Versunkene Glocke," which came 
next after " Florian Geyer," is nothing of this 
sort at all. It is labelled a " marchendrama," 



a fairy play ; its time is a half-legendary period 
when Christianity has not long conquered 
paganism; its characters are not only flesh- 
and-blood villagers, but elves, woodsprites, 
nixies ; its action is more of a symbol of some 
general truth of life than a presentation of any- 
thing that ever took place. It is not realistic 
at all, unless we call it so from the realities it 
has been held to symbolize ; it is not only ro- 
mance, but it is the romance of Germany, which 
is the species farthest removed from realism. 
It is worth mentioning that " Die Versun- 
kene Glocke " is not the only play of its kind 
in Germany nowadays. About one year after 
Hauptmann had turned to history and then to 
romance, Sudermann did the same thing. First 
came " Teja," a one-act tragedy of the later 
days of the Roman Empire ; then " Johannes," 
a drama founded on the life and death of the 
Baptist ; and lastly " Die drei Reihefedern " 
(" The Three Heronfeathers "), rather more 
frankly romantic than Hauptmann even. And 
it may also be added that although some of the 
younger dramatists have succeeded in realism 

for instance, Max Halbe in " Mutter Erde " 

others have made a name in romance, and 
that before " The Sunken Bell," notably Lud- 
wig Fulda with " Der Talisman " and Ernst 
Rosmer with " Die Konigskinder " (" The 
Children of the King "). So we might view 
the change in Hauptmann's standpoint as a 
change in tendency. A curious fact, however, 
is that in his next play, " Fuhrmann Henschel," 
Hauptmann returned to psychologic realism ; 
nor does he attempt romance in " Schluck und 
Jau." So that " The Sunken Bell " stands alone 
among his works. 

It is, then, not the normal Hauptmann that 
we have in this romantic allegory. Who is 
the normal Hauptmann ? one may ask. Is he 
the author of " Einsame Menschen," or of 
"Die Weber," or of "Hannele"? Neither 
one nor the other, would be the answer ; but 
he is the author of all three, and of " Florian 
Geyer," too, and of " Fuhrmann Henschel " as 
well. He wrote " Die Versunkene Glocke," 
doubtless, and so did Ibsen write " Brand " 
and " Peer Gynt." But if one got one's idea 
of Hauptmann from "Die Versunkene Glocke" 
alone, one would be too like the lady who wrote 
a paper on Dickens after reading only " A 
Tale of Two Cities." She was asked why she 
had not spoken of Dickens as a humorist, and 
answered that she had not known that he had 
been one. 

If one could read but one play of Haupt- 



432

mann's, the one to read would be " Hanneles 
Himmelfahrt." It has enough realism and 
enough of the romance that life itself has. It 
has the psychology that his admirers long for, 
but in such form that one is quite free to think 
it something else. It has as true poetry as 
" Die Versunkene Glocke," and as true human 
sympathy as " Die Weber." It is, in fact, 
although the shortest, yet the greatest of its 
author's plays. Not one other of Hauptmann's 
plays but has been equalled by somebody else. 
" Einsame Menschen " is not stronger than 
Sudermann's " Heimat " or Max Halbe's 
" Mutter Erde," which are on something like 
the same subject. " Die Weber " is certainly 
almost sui generis : but it is not quite, being 
easily paralleled by Verhaeren's ' Dawn." 
" Die Versunkene Glocke," as has been said, is 
one of several, even in Germany, at the present 
day. But the only drama that reminds me of 
" Hannele " is Maeterlinck's " Mort de Tinta- 
gilis "; and this very beautiful work of the 
Belgian is conceived in such a different mood 
from " Hannele," and so lacks that support of 
firm flesh and blood that makes " Hannele " so 
wonderfully appealing, that we really cannot 
say that the two plays are of the same kind. 

Yet whether our present play be eminently 
characteristic of Hauptmann or not, it is a very 
beautiful play, both to read and to see. It is 
full of the spirit of German myth (though 
occasionally with strange anachronisms which 
are doubtless the result of the modern spirit) ; 
it has much charming poetry, it has a well- 
developed and pathetic motive, it has original 
and attractive figures. I have less interest in 
its allegory, or symbolism, which has greatly 
interested the German critics. Doubtless Hein- 
rich may be taken for one of those figures not 
rare in literature Faust, Manfred, Brand 
which are representative of the restless unsatis- 
fied soul of humanity. But then so is Hamlet 
representative, and so is Prospero ; yet each of 
these last is also and more especially a per- 
sonal character. So is Heinrich a personal 
character, a man in whom one may concentrate 
interest and sympathy. True, he is not a very 
strong man ; Hauptmann's men are apt to be 
weaklings, and purposely so : Alfred Loth in 
" Vor Sonnenaufgang," and John Vockerat in 
' Einsame Menschen," for instance. To me, 
the chief character in the play is not the Bell- 
founder but Rautendelein the Woodelf . With 
some other of Hauptmann's women Fraulein 
Anna Mahr, say, and Hannele she makes, 
upon me at least, the first and last impression. 



It is not an allegorical impression, or symbol- 
istic, but a poetic impression. 

I believe I think of Hauptmann, on the 
whole, not as a realist or a romanticist, but 
rather as a poet. As some poets have cast 
their work largely in dramatic form, so has 
Hauptmann. If you would realize the matter by 
contrast, you may put the character of Fraulein 
Anna Mahr, just mentioned, beside that of 
Magda in Sudermann's " Heimath." Suder- 
mann is a novelist ; and Magda has all the 
strength and firmness of a skilful novelist's 
work. But Anna Mahr is more delicate, and 
more pathetic, and more suggestive, and more 
of a poetic conception. 

Doubtless poets are not apt to be realists. 
But here is one that is. He is a dreamer, but 
a dreamer who is so impressed by waking life 
that his dreams are not a mere phantasmagoria. 
They are still dreams, but they follow the logic 
of waking life, and to their author this logic is 
quite as interesting as anything else. We 
might apply to him the lines put into the mouth 
of Heinrich, with somewhat different meaning : 

" I see I feel I know the smallest thing 
Even to the pattern of this coverlet. 
Each thread each tiny knot I could describe ; 
And yet I 'm dreaming."

AN EPISCOPAL, RACONTEUR.* 



Of all the Bishops of the American Episcopal 
Church who have sought to deliver their liter- 
ary message to the world in the form of remi- 
niscences, none have been quite so fortunate as 
the Bishop of Minnesota. His good fortune 
consists partly in the time he has selected for 
this contribution to American literature. The 
end of a century naturally finds the popular 
mind prepared to be entertained with historical 
and biographical gossip. Bishop Whipple, by 
reason of the peculiar position he has main- 
tained in both Church and State throughout 
half a century, by the width of his experiences, 
his keen sense of humor, and his unbounded 
optimism, is eminently qualified to gratify this 
popular interest. If the fault be found that 
in his sumptuous octavo volume of 576 pages 
(including appendices and index) he has paid 
little regard to chronological sequence in the

arrangement of the incidents he relates, it may 
be replied that the book is not intended to be 
an autobiography nor a contribution to history. 
One of its chief charms (and it is a charming 
book) lies in the naive artlessness with which 
the Bishop tells the story, or perhaps more 
properly the stories, of the stirring times in 
which he has lived. Not but that the Bishop 
possesses valuable historical materials for which 
coming generations might be grateful. Upon 
the relations of our government and of our 
civilization to the Indians, for example, the 
Bishop could tell a story that would be of ines- 
timable value. To this subject he has devoted 
a large part of his book and more than sixty- 
five pages of appendices. His life also furnishes 
many elements of a successful biography. But 
the general reader has reason to be grateful 
that in forestalling the post-mortem biographer 
and taking the law in his own hands he has 
written reminiscences and recollections rather 
than an autobiography. 

Bishop W hippie belongs to a family that 
furnished sixteen heroes to the Colonial and 
Revolutionary wars and two signers of the 
Declaration of Independence. That he should 
hold the post of Chaplain-General of the Socie- 
ties of the Sons of the Revolution and Colonial 
Wars of the United States, seems logical and 
appropriate. He is a native of the state of 
New York. He does not tell us, but it is be- 
traying no confidence to state, that his birth 
year was 1823. After his school days, by the 
advice of a physician he entered active business. 
He was attracted to political life, was appointed 
Division Inspector of Militia, and was once 
secretary of a convention for the nomination of 
state officers. 

His career in the ministry began in 1849, 
and some fears were expressed that he might 
have spoiled a good politician to make an in- 
different clergyman. But he did neither. As 
early as 1853 he became acquainted with 
Southern life. In 1856 he organized a parish 
in Chicago, and introduced the free church 
system in that city. Three years later he was 
consecrated the first Bishop of Minnesota, a 
Diocese then including more than eighty-three 
thousand square miles of territory, and now 
reduced to twenty-six thousand square miles. 
The usual career of an American Diocesan 
Bishop was varied in his case by winters spent 
in Florida, by some foreign travel (he attended 
the first Lambeth Conference and preached 
the opening sermon before that Conference in 
1888), by building the first Protestant Cathe- 



dral in America, by a most interesting work 
among the Swedes, by the founding of schools 
at Faribault, and by the establishment of hos- 
pitals and other charitable institutions. He 
had, in fact, become so well known, both at 
home and abroad, that in 1871 he was offered 
the Bishopric of Hawaii under the English 
Church. And later he became a Trustee of the 
Peabody Board for Educational work in the 
South. 

But the Bishop's chief distinction was gained 
by reason of the existence in his Diocese of 
large numbers of Indians with whom the work 
of the extension of the Church had but just be- 
gun, and was, up to the time of his consecration, 
meeting with but partial success. For a deep 
interest in the welfare of these people he was 
prepared by his ordinarily warm sympathies, 
and by his previous experiences he was prepared 
to be especially helpful. His efforts to better 
the condition of the red men were not popular. 
He had to confront government officials and 
make scathing exposures of their official incom- 
petence or worse. He went about armed with 
documentary evidence of the truth of state- 
ments he had to make. He learned the Indian 
character, and how to interpret the message of 
the Gospel so that it might be understood by 
them. As a result he not only gathered Indian 
congregations into the fold of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church, but he trained and educated 
and ordained a native ministry. Both in 
America and in England his title of " The 
Apostle to the Indians " is recognized. So 
thorough was his knowledge of the wrongs done 
to the Indians that he was requested to write 
an introduction to Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson's 
" Century of Dishonor." So efficient did he 
prove himself in his labors for the amelioration 
of the distressing condition of the Indians that 
he won their unbounded confidence and was 
many times made a member of important Com- 
missions sent by the government to make trea- 
ties with them. 

A life so full of varied incidents could not 
fail to furnish a fund of anecdotes, and the 
Bishop would have been hiding his talent in a 
napkin if he had not become an accomplished 
raconteur. Some of his stories are thrilling to the 
borders of the dramatic, as, for example, his 
encounter with a lunatic armed for the purpose 
of shooting him. His reminiscences abound in 
anecdotes from which we predict that the clergy 
will draw for many years to come. They are 
illustrative of the ups and downs of ministerial 
life, and of the Indian character. Those be- 



434

longing to the latter class are probably of the 
freshest interest, and the specimens here given 
are selected more because of their brevity than 
otherwise. 

The Bishop once undertook to reprove Wa- 
basha for having a Scalp-Dance in front of the 
Mission House. 

" The chief was smoking, but when I had finished he 
took his pipe from his mouth, and slowly blowing a 
cloud of smoke into the air said : ' White man go to 
war with his own brother; kills more men than Wabasha 
can count all his life. Great Spirit look down and 
says, " Good white man; he has My Book; I have good 
home for him by and by." Dakota has no Great Spirit's 
Book; he goes to war, kills one man, has a foolish 
scalp-dance. Great Spirit very angry. Wabasha 
does n't believe it ! ' " 

"Indians are keen judges of character. A lawyer, 
who was reputed to be not over-scrupulous in his deal- 
ings, was employed by an Indian to draw up some 
papers. On paying his fee, the Indian asked for a re- 
ceipt and was told that a receipt would not be necessary. 
The Indian insisted upon having one, and when ques- 
tioned as to his anxiety about the matter, replied, ' Since 
becoming a Christian I have been very careful in all 
my dealings that I may be ready for the judgment, and 
when that day comes I do n't want to take time to go 
to the bad place to get my receipt from you." 

The Indians are quick at repartee. 
" An Indian agent, who was a militia colonel, desired 
to impress the Indians with the magnitude of his dignity. 
He dressed himself in full uniform, with his sword by 
his side, and rising in the council told them that one 
reason why the Great Father had had so much trouble 
with his red children was that he had sent civilians to 
them. 

" ' You are warriors,' he said, and when the Great 
Father saw me he said, " I will send this man who is a 
great warrior to my red children who are warriors, and 
they will hear his words." ' 

" An old chief arose, and surveying the speaker from 
head to foot, said calmly: 'Since I was a small boy I 
have heard that white men had great warriors. I have 
always wanted to see one. I have looked upon one, 
and now I am ready to die.' " 

Their sense of justice is thus illustrated : 

" Shakopee, one of the leaders in the [Minnesota] 
massacre of 1862, was a prisoner in Fort Snelling under 
sentence of death. He said to Dr. Daniels, who was 
visiting him : 

" What will the white men do to me ?' 

' I think you will be hanged,' the doctor answered. 

"With a quiet smile, Shakopee replied: <I am not 
afraid to die. When I go into the spirit world I will 
look the Great Spirit in the face and I will tell Him 
what the whites did to my people before we went to 
war. He will do right. I am not afraid.' " 

A clergyman who was visiting Captain Jack 
(head chief of the Modocs) in prison, after de- 
scribing heaven as a place where the streets 
were paved with gold and the houses built of 
precious stones, said : 

" ' And if you repent of your wickedness in fighting 



good white men, the Great Spirit will permit you to go 
to this place.' 

" Captain Jack listened politely, and then asked, ' Do 
you think you will go to that place ? ' 

" ' Yes,' was the answer, if I should die to-day, I 
should be there before night.' 

" If you will take my place,' was the response, ' and 
be hanged to-morrow, I will give you forty ponies.' 

" The offer was not accepted." 

Red Cloud, having been asked for a fare- 
well toast at a public dinner, arose and said : 
" When men part they look forward to meet- 
ing again. I hope that one day we may all 
meet in a land where white men are not liars." 
President Cleveland once asked Bishop 
Whipple what he thought the effect would be 
of making the Indians voters. 

" I told him that we had tried it, at which he ex- 
pressed surprise. We had a territorial law,' I ex- 
plained, ' that Indians wearing civilized dress might 
vote. At an election some one said, ' Wait till you 
hear from Pembina ! ' When they heard from Pembina 
they learned that a band of Indians had been put into 
hickory shirts and trousers between sunrise and sunset, 
and had become voters. The President smiled and 
said, ' I see how it may work.' " 

It is due to the cheerful optimism of Bishop 
Whipple that the lights are the more abun- 
dant than the shadows in his Long Episcopate. 
Among the illustrations are some facsimiles of 
letters which add interest to a book which is 
full of interest. ARTHUR HOWARD NOLL. 



THE PEOPLE AND RULERS OF THE 
NETHERLANDS.* 

The publication, in 1892-3, of Volumes I. 
and II. of a " History of the People of the 
Netherlands," by Petrus Johannes Blok, Pro- 
fessor of Dutch History in the University of 
Leyden, at once won for the author a distin- 
guished place among European scholars. This 
work is now offered in English in slightly 
abridged form, and constitutes a valuable addi- 
tion to historical literature for English readers. 
The scope of the work is indicated by this 
statement, in the preface : 

" Such a history as the author wishes to write em- 
braces all the manifestations of the life of the people, 
the political history as well as the history of civilization, 
commerce, industry, agriculture, navigation, law, and

civilization from the past. Our time asks of the his- 
torian with ever greater emphasis, How has our society 
become what it is ? " 

The author has, in the main, accomplished his 
purpose. Facts and deductions therefrom are 
stated for periods of Netherlandish history 
heretofore beyond the reach of the ordinary 
student. Characteristics and conditions im- 
portant to a correct understanding of the devel- 
opment of the people are enlarged upon, in 
distinct chapters, for each social class and for 
each element in any way instrumental in the 
formation of the modern Netherlandish states. 
It is safe to say that criticism is challenged 
only in the plan adopted, wherein Dr. Blok 
has sacrificed the sense of historical sequence 
and correlation to his desire to fix the reader's 
attention upon the subject-matter of each 
chapter. It is often difficult to determine the 
relative importance of any given social order 
in a particular epoch, or to grasp the inter- 
relation of the separate elements of the growing 
nations. 

Turning to the method of treatment, we find 
an avowed attempt has been made to use the 
semi-philosophical system which makes the 
" Short History of the English People " such 
delightful reading. This treatment is here not 
altogether successful. The charm and value of 
Green's work, in spite of some inaccuracies of 
statement, lie in the careful elimination of all 
those non-essential facts of English history 
which do not serve to elucidate an analysis of 
social and political conditions. Then, too, the 
essential facts are so interwoven with the philo- 
sophical examination as not to tire the reader 
by detailed statements. Dr. Blok makes his 
analysis of conditions a sharp, clear-cut, forci- 
ble analysis, which ill prepares the reader for 
what follows a detailed and frequently weari- 
some account of historic incidents. Still, it is 
so unusual to find a continental historian who 
recognizes any obligation beyond a classified 
and orderly presentation of the facts for which 
he has been laboriously digging, that in this 
case the author should rather be commended 
than condemned. His analyses are brilliant, 
his facts dryly stated ; he has yet to find the 
right system of combination. 

A point of unusual interest in the second 
volume is the conception of the character and 
influence of Charles the Rash of Burgundy. 
This chief among the opponents of French 
Royalty is familiar to historical readers as the 
possessor by inheritance of a great domain and 
vast wealth. Lacking the requisite adminis- 



trative ability, and impelled by a controlling 
impetuousness which made him blind to inevit- 
able consequences, he steadily dissipated his 
possessions. His schemes for a Burgundian 
Kingdom are regarded as chimerical, his admin- 
istration as directed by the chance temper of 
the moment, while the failure of his plans and 
his tragic death are but the logical result of 
unconsidered action. 

Dr. Blok does not proclaim himself a de- 
fender of Charles the Rash, nor does he urge 
a new light upon his character. He does, how- 
ever, force genuine admiration for the character 
of that prince, in a careful examination of the 
results of his work. The details of his govern- 
ment and administration, noted in various 
chapters, with the author's criticism thereon, 
exhibit in Charles an ideal of government indi- 
cative of statesmanlike qualities not general in 
the fifteenth century, a broadness of view and 
ambition creditable to any ruler, and a real 
genius in the government of his widely sepa- 
rated dominions. Like Richelieu in France, 
Charles intended to centralize, in administra- 
tion, in justice, and in finance. His purposes 
and plans as viewed to-day were admirably 
conceived, and many of them took deep root in 
Netherlandish institutions. Thus, Dr. Blok 
emphasizes the service performed by Charles 
in the destruction of numerous petty judicial 
rights of the provinces, and the substitution of 
a court system imperial in its scope though not 
in name. Nor does the failure of the Bur- 
gundian Kingdom, for which Charles inces- 
santly labored, justify the conclusion generally 
accepted that his project was merely the dream 
of an over ambitious man. Success was, indeed, 
very near, and the ultimate failure seems rather 
the chance of mischievous ill-fortune than the 
logical result of an ill-considered plan. Unlike 
Richelieu, Charles did not finally succeed in 
crushing out those separatist tendencies which 
endangered the unity of his rule. Failing to 
succeed, historians have called him " the Rash "; 
clearly he deserved the appellation in the 
later years of his rule, but it was then the rash- 
ness of despair, and of a mind distraught by 
the unexpected and sudden overthrow of a 
political edifice painfully erected by many years 
of patient labor. The true test of merit, for 
the claimant to historical honors, lies in the 
permanence of his labors and in their effect for 
good upon later forms of governmental insti- 
tutions. Judged by this standard, few rulers 
of the Burgundian territory deserve so much 
credit as does he who figures in history as the

SOCIAL DISCUSSION AND REFORM.* 

In his work on " The Development of English 
Thought," Professor Patten has chosen bis economic 
material from the mother country because her insular 
position and the freedom of her government have 
left the process of intellectual development compara- 
tively unhindered. The theory illustrated is thus 
stated : " Survival is determined and progress 
created by a struggle for the requisites of which 
the supply is insufficient. These requisites are 
the goods for which men strive or the means by 
which they may avert evils. A group of such defi- 
nite objects upon which the life and happiness of 
each race depends, always exists. The environ- 
ment formed by this group of economic objects sur- 
rounding and supporting a given race changes with

the several objects in which the interests of the 
race are centred. With the new objects come new 
activities and new requisites for survival. To meet 
these new conditions, the motives, instincts, and 
habits of the race are modified ; new modes of 
thought are formed ; and thus, by the modification 
of institutions, ideals, and customs, all the character- 
istics of the civilization are reconstructed." The 
body of the work is given to an account of the 
journey of a student of philosophy into the world 
of the economist. Literature and history are seen 
through an economist's eyes. We follow the author 
through the statement of his theory, a psychological 
and biological discussion of environment, race ideals, 
social stratification, stages in the progress of thought, 
curves of thought. Mankind he divides into four 
classes, whose odd titles provoke irreverent mirth 
at the first reading : the Clingers, Sensualists, Stal- 
warts, and Mugwumps. The types are described 
by the epithets ; and the history of English thought 
is the story of the struggle of these classes for exist- 
ence and control. Mandeville's " Fable of the 
Bees " is made a new starting-point for the treatment 
of the writers of the eighteenth century, Hume, 
Adam Smith, and Whitefield. Under the title 
" Economists " we have not only Ricardo, Malthus, 
and Mill, but also Darwin, the English poets, and 
the Oxford Movement. Throughout the volume 
are scattered acute and ingenious interpretations 
of particular writers and currents of speculation. 
It is in the last chapter that the author's position 
comes out most clearly. The key to this position 
is the biological phrase " condition of survival." 
Certain economic conditions will dominate the future 
and create the economic pressure out of which 
the movement of thought will proceed. The unity 
of the race is said to be not environmental but 
psychic ; the race ideals and social standards are 
not the mere reflection of external conditions, but 
are the products of psychic activity. But if the 
advance thought does not prove of permanent ad- 
vantage, the race which accepts it dies out and 
others take the place. Science exercises its power 
by creating new economic conditions, and these 
modify national thought. A great invention changes 
the conditions of survival and allows a new type of 
man to succeed. The Royal Society did not kill 
superstition with lectures. " Superstition died when 
men got regular employment and three meals a day. 
The habits of thought creating superstition come 
from an irregular life and from the impossibility of 
predicting future events or of providing for future 
needs." Dyspepsia creates new superstitions and 
inclines men to swallow quack remedies. " Cheap 
food and a sugar diet make the conditions out of 
which the thought movement of the present epoch 
will proceed." Alcohol drinkers will be exterminated 
by the industrial order, and sugar-eaters will sur- 
vive and possess the land. But appetite for sweets 
must be held under control, or Bright's disease and 
apoplexy will catch them. "The elimination of 
sensual men, and of women made inactive by art, 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



437 



literature, and a sugar diet, are the prominent causes 
of modifications in the national character. Economic 
experience and thinking lead upward to religion." 
Such are some of the author's positions and conclu- 
sions. We are here dealing with a man of learning 
and profound reflection. Yet there is something 
lacking. One is compelled to ask, when all has been 
told as to the " conditions of survival," whether 
survival is the end of living, and whether there may 
not he a tolerance of many styles of character 
among the survivors. To account for Shakespeare, 
Tennyson, and Wordsworth, in the most complete 
sense, can we get all the help we need from economic 
conditions ? 

The translation of Signer Loria's powerful hook, 
" The Economic Foundations of Society," will ex- 
tend the influence of one of the ablest of Italian 
economists. It does not seem likely that his theory 
of the progress of society can be generally accepted 
as complete and final, but this work presents in a 
powerful light one of the forces of evolution and 
suggests many points of fruitful speculation. The 
point most insisted on is that the origin of society, 
of its institutions, its ethics, its spiritual ideals, is to 
be accounted for on economic grounds. The author's 
preface is a challenge to idealists : " The book re- 
vealed the secret to the world ; it boldly declared, 
what no one had had the courage to say, that cu- 
pidity, narrow, mean egoism, and class spirit ruled 
in our so called democracies ; it ruthlessly unmasked 
the political deities that the world had been in the 
habit of invoking with pompous phrases, and, rais- 
ing the veil that covered them, it showed that where 
we had expected to find the mystical Isis, there was 
only a yawning, greedy crocodile." The idealist, 
however, may still take his stand at two lines of 
defense : first, when he denies that economic forces 
are the sufficient explanation of social origins ; and, 
secondly, when he insists that " economic " motives 
are themselves composed of all human desires which 
call for material means of satisfaction. 

While we are reading, in parallel columns of our 
daily newspapers, detailed accounts of street-car 
riots in Berlin and St. Louis, of bloody assaults and 
threatened bankruptcies in building trades in Chi- 
cago, and of ill-suppressed hate and rebellion in 
industrial circles almost everywhere, it is refreshing 
to learn of one little oasis where men can discuss 
their business differences without resort to duel and 
vendetta. New Zealand some years ago grew 
weary of the mediaeval barbarism of industrial war- 
fare, and also of modes of voluntary arbitration 
without legal support. The community did not 
choose a scheme of arbitration which would simply 
create a combination of employers and trades unions 
in a conspiracy to raise prices for the great con- 
suming public. They resolved to protect the com- 
mon welfare by legislation and judicial process. 
Mr. H. D. Lloyd, in his account of " A Country 
Without Strikes," has told the story in plain, intel- 
ligible, and convincing form. It is not probable 
that America will heed his lesson and prophecy at 



once. The partial and tentative methods must be 
further tried until their essential fallacies have been 
shown and their costly educational work has been 
done. The New Zealand experiment is carried on 
in a small country under peculiar conditions, and 
its law will undergo many modifications ; but it 
gives the only rational promise for a certain and 
just decision of class controversies and partisan 
strife. The timeliness and practical wisdom of 
Mr. Lloyd's little book should procure for it a wide 
reading. 

In "The Theory of the Leisure Class," Mr. 
Thorstein Veblen discusses the place and value of 
the leisure class as an economic factor in modern 
life. The grounds of class distinctions are sought 
in primitive institutions. Property and ownership 
had their origin in emulation during a period of 
predatory acquisition. The enslavement of women 
was a part of the process. Economic production, 
useful drudgery, fell to women and other slaves. 
Exploitation became the business of nobles and the 
reputable. The productive industries became shame- 
ful. Possession of wealth without labor marked 
the superior race and the ruling class. Government 
was instituted, and is still maintained, as the means 
of keeping the exploiters in possession. The con- 
ventional marks of this superiority are conspicuous 
leisure and conspicuous consumption. The author 
distinctly disavows any purpose to test the canons of 
taste, art, fashion, and ceremony by any standard 
except the economical ; and the reader must, in 
fairness, bear this claim in mind. The author pro- 
ceeds with the cool temper of pure intelligence, the 
calculation of an " economic man." We should give 
him credit for absolute sincerity when he affirms 
repeatedly that he has no ethical, aasthetical, or 
transcendental criterion in mind. His style is 
chilled steel : hard, cold, and sharp. Its light is 
dry and frosty. The word " socialism " is scrupu- 
lously avoided, but the arguments made familiar by 
socialists gleam through the sentences of every 
chapter. The sole test of institutions, in this book, 
is their economic or industrial usefulness. Useful- 
ness, apparently, is nowhere defined ; but we may 
get light from the definition of " waste ": " It is not 
to be taken in an odious sense, as implying an ille- 
gitimate expenditure of human products or life. 
In the view of economic theory the expenditure in 
question is no more and no less legitimate than any 
other expenditure. It is here called ' waste ' be- 
cause this expenditure does not serve human life or 
well-being on the whole, not because it is waste or 
misdirection of effort or expenditure from the stand- 
point of the individual consumer who chooses it." 
That is " waste " which does not enhance well-being 
on the whole ; which fails to promote the generically 
human, the collective good. An impartial judgment 
of the conclusions would be easier if the author had 
given us a nearer view of his standard of usefulness. 
While we must accept his disclaimer that he does 
not mean to apply any but strictly "economic" 
texts to contemporary customs, those who practice 



438 



THE DIAL 



these customs must be very thick-skinned if they 
can read his pages without wincing or revolt. The 
hook is too strong to be thrust aside. It is an 
academic, subtle, and acute phrasing of what the 
working men, " conscious of their goal," are saying 
about us in every shop and Sunday trades council. 
Here lies a great merit of the book, in spite of a 
somewhat evasive manner of approach : it compels 
the " respectable " class to see themselves as others 
see them, if they care for that accomplishment. 
A banker, on reading about himself here, will per- 
haps not like to be classed among the " predatory " 
classes even if nothing " odious " is intended. A 
lawyer will hardly look a second time for the Pick- 
wickian sense of this characterization : " The pro- 
fession of the law does not imply large ownership; 
but since no taint of usefulness, for other than the 
competitive purpose, attaches to the lawyer's trade, 
it grades high in the conventional scheme. The 
lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of 
predatory fraud, either in achieving or in checkmat- 
ing chicane, and success in the profession is therefore 
accepted as marking a large endowment of that 
barbarian astuteness which has always commanded 
men's respect and fear." In the most polite way 
a comparison is set up between delinquents, gam- 
blers, and business men. " Patriotism " is identified 
with the martial spirit, and this with the barbarian 
virtues of ferocity and pitilessness. Boys' brigades 
and athletic sports are explained by the leisure- 
class morality of barbarian love of cruelty and fraud. 
The training for foot-ball leads to a " rehabilitation 
and accentuation of those ferine traits which make 
for damage and desolation." Truculence and clan- 
nishness are the marks of the athlete. There is 
one more mark, common to criminals, gamblers, 
and classical scholars, anthropomorphic worship, 
which is part of the leisure class machinery for 
holding up the regime of status and subservience, 
although this is without conscious purpose. After 
reading many pages devoted to this scalping and 
skinning process, a priest, a captain of industry, or 
a classical scholar may be soothed and mollified by 
reading (p. 265) : " The exigencies of the language 
make it impossible to avoid an apparent implication 
of disapproval of the apitudes, propensities, and 
expressions of life here under discussion. It is, 
however, not intended to imply anything in the way 
of deprecation or commendation of any one of these 
phases of human character or of the life process." 
Grim pleasantry aside, we have here to deal with 
a man who cuts deep and means to be true and 
candid. Many who need his message will not read 
it, or will throw it aside in anger and contempt. It is 
one-sided. It confessedly leaves in the background 
the values of the higher existence, and discusses 
chiefly the proximate means of welfare. The defi- 
nition of the " economic man " seems, save from 
the author's standpoint, a very low and narrow one 
to one of the " respectable " class. The omission 
of the real aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual elements 
of welfare seems to leave even industry without an 



explanation. Yet here is a quiet, stern, honest 
man, who compels the reader to face reality in one 
of its aspects. Better to " pick out treasure from 
an earthen pot " than miss the gem through pride 
or fear or prejudice. Professor Veblen has stated 
with unusual clearness the explanation of the famil- 
iar fact that many reforms have been started from 
the " lower classes "; ideas of betterment which 
seemed revolutionary and even absurd to educated 
and cultivated men, yet were finally accepted by all 
as reasonable. The demands of the peasants in 
Luther's day ; the claims of the Chartists in En- 
gland ; the propositions for factory legislation 
which were commonly rejected by upper class econ- 
omists and statesmen, these may be taken as ex- 
amples. Christianity may offer parallels : " Do any 
of the rulers believe?" The explanation seems 
reasonable and adequate : the poor feel the pressure 
of new conditions long before the stress comes upon 
the sheltered leisure class. Professor Veblen illus- 
trates, by this book, a new element in the move- 
ment of our day, the intense and profound revolt 
of scholars and independent thinkers against the 
dictation of the money power in the field of thought. 
The force of literary sarcasm may come to be felt, 
and the attempt to suppress it by arts known to the 
rulers must provoke a worse reaction. 

It is fortunate for the general reader that he has 
a reliable and readable translation of that one of 
Tarde's recent discussions which presents his views 
of social psychology in a somewhat systematic form, 
under the title " Social Laws." The heads of the 
treatise are the repetition of phenomena, the oppo- 
sition of phenomena, and the adaptation of phe- 
nomena. The speculations are very suggestive, and 
the clear and brilliant style of the author should win 
for him a wide reading. 

" Better- World Philosophy," by Mr. J. Howard 
Moore, is a strong plea for social control in the 
interest of the entire community ; an argument for 
the predominance of altruism in education, politics, 
and all life. The element of progress most insisted 
upon is education, the conscious effort of contem- 
porary society to shape to higher forms the mem- 
bers of the coming race. 

It is possible to present a very dark picture of 
the existence of pauperism, crime, and attendant 
miseries, without leaving the basis of facts. " He- 
redity and Human Progress " recites the story 
with strong realism, with the insight of a physician 
and with literary skill. The failure of charity 
and reformatory measures is argued from abundant 
resources of illustration. Heredity is declared 
to be the principal source of all the weakness 
and perversity which occasion dependency, defect, 
and crime. Then comes the remedy, all else hav- 
ing failed : the painless extermination by the use 
of carbonic acid gas of all those who are depend- 
ent on the public as paupers, degenerates, and 
habitual criminals. Most of us will think that such 
a wholesale slaughter of perhaps a hundred thou- 
sand of the feeble-minded, and nearly the same

THE DIAL 



number in each class of criminals, drunkards, epi- 
leptics, in a single day or year, is hardly to be taken 
seriously. The author does not count on very 
speedily obtaining a majority as friends of his 
panacea, because " sentiment " is against him. But 
sentiment is a fact which makes his scheme impos- 
sible, according to his own principle : " All wise 
legislation has a care for expediency, and the present 
plan aims not at the theoretical best, but at the best 
which is practicable, with least resistance from the 
people." Most students and practical men would 
reject his plan quite apart from " sentiment " ; 
since they believe it is a return to processes of elim- 
ination which belong to unmoral nature and un- 
taught savages ; that there is a better method in 
segregation, possibly supplemented by steriliza- 
tion ; and that these methods, so far from having 
failed, are steadily reducing the evils which are 
here so graphically depicted. One can advocate 
" stirpiculture " with entire conviction, without feel- 
ing it necessary to kill at a stroke several hundred 
thousands of helpless human beings, while leaving 
untouched and unreformed those vicious social ar- 
rangements which would immediately produce an- 
other multitude of defectives within two generations. 
The author accounts for the transmission of traits 
by inheritance, but does not adequately account for 
the origin of defects in a bad environment. 

In Mr. Jacob A. Riis, the famous newspaper re- 
former of slums and tenement-house evils, we find 
a man who emphasizes environment rather than 
heredity, and believes that it is worth while to im- 
prove conditions. He dedicates "A Ten Years' War " 
to " the faint-hearted and those of little faith." 
The antidote for fatalism and pessimism lies in such 
chapters as the breezy reporter has written. He 
has studied the anatomy and pathology of crowded 
cities, as the author of " Heredity and Progress " 
has studied brains and physical transmission of 
traits ; and the conclusion is very different. The 
deterioration of physical structure, vitality, and 
intellectual energy, is traced to the miserable sur- 
roundings which are the product of neglect and 
cowardice. Very instructive and inspiring is the 
Account of the strategical methods of those who 
succeeded in correcting many of the evils which 
curse the metropolis. 

The resident chaplain of San Quentin prison, 
California, the Rev. August Drahms, has given us 
the results of his observation and reflection upon 
the phenomena of crime. Lombroso furnishes an 
introductory note, in which he declares that he finds 
the author in substantial agreement with his own 
positions, except when it is said that the American 
criminal differs in physiognomical type from his 
European contemporary. The topics treated are 
the instinctive criminal, the habitual criminal, the 
single offender, the demography of crime, the juve- 
nile offender and the reformatories, hypnotism and 
crime, and practical suggestions in relation to pun- 
ishment, reformation, and prevention. 

The very proof we have wanted to show that 



'.' Friendly Visiting " is practicable is given us by 
Miss Richmond, in her book with that title. She 
not only writes inspiringly, but she tells us just what 
to do and how to go about doing it. Charity Organ- 
ization is a lifeless thing without this personal service. 
The hired agent can never perform the duty of the 
well-to-do, vicariously and at long range. Those 
who make real reports from the unknown country of 
misery must travel and reside with the indigent, 
and become their genuine partners in struggle. This 
small volume tells the aspirant how to help the bread- 
winner, to gain the confidence of the home-maker, 
to watch over the children, to become a missionary 
of sanitary science, of thrift, and of rational pleasure. 
The directions in respect to relief and the relations 
of the Church to charity are eminently wise. 

A good discussion of methods is found in Miss 
Brown's book on "The Development of Thrift." 
The charity visitor and settlement worker should 
master the principles and devices of this volume, 
which presents in elementary form the most prac- 
tical aspects of schemes for saving, building and 
loan associations, banks, provident loan societies, 
insurance and friendly societies. The books of 
Miss Brown and of Miss Richmond are good text- 
books for the students of clubs and circles of workers 
among the dependent poor. 

For the social student who interests himself in 
the temperance reform, the able and impartial work 
of Mr. Koren on " Economic Aspects of the Liquor 
Problem " will be found indispensable. There is no 
attempt to cover ground already occupied by the 
Twelfth Annual Report of the Federal Department 
of Labor and the Twenty-sixth Annual Report of 
the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor. Entirely new 
fields of investigation have been exploited : the re- 
lations of the liquor problem to poverty and desti- 
tution, to crime, to negroes, and the saloon as a 
distributing agency of liquor in cities. It is inter- 
esting to observe one of the indirect advantages of 
the records of the charity organization societies which 
many have unreflectingly denounced as "red tape." 
In this volume, their painstaking study of causes 
of destitution becomes fruitful and instructive. A 
valuable bibliography closes this important contri- 
bution to the literature of the subject. 

Very much of current discussion of the negro 
problem is wide of the mark because it is based on 
fragmentary observations and inadequate materials. 
There is great need of systematic and thorough local 
studies of the conditions of life under which col- 
ored people live in our great cities. A model for 
such studies is found in the brilliant essay of a 
colored student and teacher who has won distinc- 
tion by his writings. Professor W. E. B. Du Bois 
has collected a vast amount of information in 
relation to the Philadelphia negro, his history, 
domestic relations, education, occupations, health, 
organized associations, crime, pauperism, social 
consideration and opportunities, and political out- 
look. Miss Isabel Eaton, fellow of the College 
Settlements' Association, has added a valuable re-

port on the domestic service of the colored people. 
When similar local studies are made, as they ought 
to be made, in other cities, and in rural communi- 
ties, the general plan of this investigation will be 
found very useful. 

The principal of the famous school for negroes at 
Tuskegee, Alabama, Mr. Booker T. Washington, has 
rendered his race and the nation a valuable service 
by setting forth his views of " The Future of the 
American Negro " in systematic form. He urges in- 
dustrial education as the chief present need of his 
race, but he is too broad a man to ignore other factors 
in instruction and political action. Not only for the 
sake of the colored people, but for the sake of the na- 
tional honor and security, it is to be hoped that this 
book will have a wide reading. It is by no means 
the last word on the educational problem, but it is an 
important contribution and deserves public consid- 
eration in the North as well as in the South. 

" Good Citizenship " is the title of a collection of 
twenty -three essays on social, personal, and eco- 
nomic problems, edited by Messrs. J. E. Hand and 
Charles Gore. These papers touch, in a popular way, 
current topics of great interest, as the functions 
of the State, housing of the people, old-age pensions, 
poor laws, socialism, and the duties of religious 
people in relation to such matters. The discussion 
is carried on by English writers in the spirit of 
" Christian Socialism." 

The sub-title "The Story of a Workingman's 
Club, its search for the causes of poverty and social 
inequality, its discussions, and its plan for the ame- 
lioration of existing evils " of Mr. David Lubin's 
" Let There Be Light " is an indication of the wan- 
dering of a modern Ulysses in the world of social 
confusion. The discussions are reported in the 
form of a story without a plot. The plan is simply 
a skeleton of topics, and a resolution to form a kind 
of ethical culture society or Universal Church for 
further discussion of schemes of betterment. The 
work affords no practical proposition within the 
field of economic or legal organization. 

"The Regeneration of the United States," by 
Mr. W. M. Grinnell, is an optimistic vision of the 
glory of the nation. Within the compass of a few 
short chapters, the prophet glances at many of the 
lessons of our past history and ventures upon 
prophecy in relation to our social and political future.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Dr. wheeier't Numerous as are the tales of Alex- 
new life of ander the Great and his life and 
Alexander. achievements have been the inspira- 
tion of hundreds there has been for them all but 
one point of view. Inevitably the enthusiastic his- 
torian has drifted, perhaps unconsciously, from a 
true historical perspective into such abject hero- 
worship that the glory of matchless victories has 
settled upon a divinity rather than a man. It is, 



then, an almost unexpected pleasure to find Dr. 
Benjamin Ide Wheeler's volume on Alexander 
(Putnam) giving us a true portrait of him as a 
human being. The great hero of antiquity is greater 
in every way as a man than as a god, and the story 
of his glorious achievements is here charmingly 
told ; indeed, it is not too much to say that very 
few brief memoirs of great men have been written 
in so delightful a fashion. Alexander himself is 
defended by Dr. Wheeler from the accustomed 
charge of having encouraged a personal god-worship 
by his followers. He says : " The idea that he 
undertook to establish a formal cult of himself, and 
to impose it upon the nations under his rule, par- 
ticularly upon the Greeks, lacks all foundation. . . . 
The notion that Alexander utilized the doctrine of 
his divinity as a fundamental and constitutive prin- 
ciple of his empire is so utterly at variance with 
the plain historical facts, so utterly lacking in sup- 
port from any known facts, as to possess no interest 
except for its absurdity. It is a mere nightmare of 
some schematizing historians." One of the most 
delightful things in the book, almost humorously so 
at times, is the author's pleasure in Alexander's 
victories as a game well played. To Alexander, in 
his earlier years at least, war is a sport in which 
the joy of winning is foremost, the more remote 
result in empire-building being of secondary import- 
ance. In recounting how well Alexander played 
this game, Mr. Wheeler is as enthusiastic as if ex- 
tolling the merits of some great athlete, and occa- 
sionally even uses the terms of modern sport to 
describe the winning of a battle as when Alex- 
ander by a " flying wedge " at Gaugamela pene- 
trates and destroys the solid mass of the enemy. 
Every lover of college athletics knows Dr. Wheeler 
as a most earnest supporter of sport in its best form, 
and will sympathize with his admiration of Alex- 
ander's love of fair fighting. It helps, also, to an 
understanding of the human side of the hero's char- 
acter. In general, this life of Alexander is excel- 
lently suited to the " Heroes of the Nations " series 
in which it appears, and is one of the best volumes 
of that series. The style is simple yet forcible, and 
the interest in the story is successfully maintained. 
The author has known where to draw the line be- 
tween matters of general interest and those of 
value only to students of antiquity, and has ex- 
cluded the latter class. There are many good illus- 
trations, together with numerous excellent maps 
and battle plans. 

The late Duchess of Teck, perhaps 
better known as Princess Mary, was 
an estimable woman who was widely 
beloved in England for her gracious demeanor, 
sweet philanthropy, and ceaseless activity in public 
and private charities ; and it was inevitable, as well 
as eminently proper, that she should be made the sub- 
ject of a memorial volume. Yet we cannot but think 
that Mr. C. Kinloch Cooke's two bulky volumes, 
entitled " A Memoir of Her Royal Highness Prin-

cess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck " (Scribners* 
importation), are, like the girth of Sir John Falstaff, 
" out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass," 
when the relative importance of their subject, the 
brevity of human life, and the amount of reading 
that people who read must get through with now- 
adays, are taken into consideration. One moderate- 
sized volume, with a leaning to the side of mercy, 
would have been amply sufficient to tell the tale of 
Princess Mary's virtues and benefactions, and the 
story of her placid, uneventful life. But Mr. Cooke 
gives us nearly 900 closely printed pages quite 
enough for a sufficient life of a man like Mr. Glad- 
stone, whose career embodied a good share of the 
history of his time. Let us hasten to say that Mr. 
Cooke's part in these volumes is mainly that of 
editor. The bulk of their contents is from Princess 
Mary's amiable and smooth-flowing but by no means 
sprightly or literate pen, in the form of diary and 
correspondence. It is a chronicle largely, it must 
in candor be said of small beer : domestic happen- 
ings, little journeys, feminine prattle of charity 
bazaars, sewing circles, training schools, social 
" functions," and what not. It is all very sweet- 
tempered, gracious, mildly interesting, even mildly 
informing in its small way ; and it deals at times 
with the minor doings of personages whose domes- 
tic life and economy even republican America likes 
to peep in upon. But there is too much of it. One 
shudders to think what Mr. Cooke might prove 
capable of, quantitatively, were it to become his 
mournful duty one day to prepare a like memoir 
of Her Majesty ! Apart from its sins of non- 
omission, Mr. Cooke's editing is all that can be 
desired. The work is well arranged and judiciously 
annotated, and there is a good index. Mr. Cooke's 
accompanying thread of narrative is graceful and 
to the point, and one by no means grudges the 
space devoted to it. The volumes are beautifully 
made, finely printed, and richly illustrated with por- 
traits mainly. The lovely plate representing Princess 
Mary bending over the infant Prince Alexander 
(p. 72) is a gem in its way, and might alone tempt 
one to buy the work containing it. 

Satis and Professor Percy Gardner, in his 

origin of " Exploratio Evangelica " (Putnam), 

Christianity. conducts what he calls "a brief ex- 
mination " into this interesting subject. His stand- 
ing in the world of letters is a sufficient preliminary 
pledge of the value of the work, which thorough ex- 
amination fully confirms. " The general tendency " 
of the book, he remarks in his preface, " is to 
transfer the burden of support of Christian doctrine 
from history to psychology, perhaps rather from the 
history of facts to the history of ideas." He quotes 
Amiel : " What our age especially needs is a trans- 
lation of Christianity from the domain of history to 
the domain of psychology." And Professor Jowett 
also: "Religion is not dependent on historical 
events, the report of which we cannot altogether 
trust. Holiness has its sources elsewhere than in 



history." It is needless to say that such a transfer 
as this is a great one. Traditionary Christianity 
prides itself on being an historical religion ; and a 
shift from a basis of alleged fact to subjective 
experience is greater than any made in the history 
of Christian thought, with two possible exceptions 
the shift from the simple ethical religion of Jesus 
to the philosophical religion that was set up in its 
room by the Greek theologians, and the shift from 
the authority of the Church to the authority of 
Scripture interpreted by private judgment, which 
was the great achievement of the Protestant Refor- 
mation. The transfer now proposed, which is of 
course in no sense original with Professor Gardner, 
is brought forward by those who believe in what 
they regard as the essentials of Christianity, but 
who are at the same time convinced that critical 
investigation has destroyed forever the historical 
basis, as it has been held, of the Bible. The reader 
will find this conviction stated briefly but strongly 
in the present volume, and, what is more to the 
purpose, will find an indication of the main lines 
along which, as the writer thinks, the transfer from 
the old basis to the new must be effected. Apart 
from theories and doctrinal views, the book can be 
most thoroughly recommended as the work of a 
conscientious scholar, a trained critic, a practised 
writer, and a man of unquestioned religious faith 
and feeling. It is all the more significant, perhaps, 
coming as it does from a layman. The book may 
cause the ultra orthodox to grieve, but there is no 
class of persons who more need to read books of 
this character than the ultra orthodox. 



The Novel 
at seen by an 
evolutionist. 



Similar in form and binding to the 
invaluable work by Professor Cross 
on " The Development of the English 
Novel," recently noticed in these columns, there 
now appears a volume by Professor Francis Hovey 
Stoddard, entitled " The Evolution of the English 
Novel" (Macmillan). If Professor Stoddard had 
not multiplied words had he seen fit to compress 
his two hundred and odd pages into half the space 
he would doubtless have given us a very readable 
and helpful brief essay upon the theory which he 
here expounds. While not without value to the 
student in this department of literature, the book is 
weakened greatly by its author's endless repetitions 
and discursions. As a serious study it is distinctly 
inferior to the work of Professor Cross. The au- 
thor does not attempt to derive the novel in its 
modern manifestation by definite stages through 
successive historic forms of literature ; but he affirms 
a law of tendency, which he declares " is, in general, 
that the depiction of the external, objective, carnal, 
precedes, in every form of expression of which we 
can have records, the consideration of the internal, 
the subjective, the spiritual." " Fiction begins with 
the objective novel ; it progresses into the intro- 
spective and the subjective novel." In a broad and 
reasonably generous application of this theory, it 
strikes us that there is not much to provoke argu-

ment. Indeed, ordinary students of all or any of the 
expressed forms of literary creation have observed 
its very natural working before. It hardly calls for 
ten pages of profuse illustration, introducing Com- 
modore Vanderbilt's locomotives, stage ghosts, medi- 
aeval penitents, the American college of seventy 
years ago, the early kings of England, and modern 
politics, to give the idea sufficient plausibility for 
further consideration by the reader. In successive 
chapters the author treats the Growth of Person- 
ality in Fiction, the Historical Novel, the Romantic 
Novel, the Novel of Purpose, the Modern Novel 
and its Mission. Much of this matter is really of 
interest to one acquainted somewhat with the field 
reviewed, and there are ideas of distinct value. 
The characterizations of typical novels are well 
worth reading, and the chapter on the Novel of 
Purpose is particularly commendable. With respect 
to Professor Stoddard's argument in detail, we are 
bound to say that the choice of novels by which he 
supports his theory seems arbitrary ; he certainly 
ignores some striking examples that do not wholly 
harmonize with his view. 



The control 
of monopolies 
and trustt. 



Professor Ely continues his well- 
known studies of economics in his 
interesting book on " Monopolies and 
Trusts " (Macmillan). His definition of monop- 
oly clears away much current confusion : " Mo- 
nopoly means that substantial unity of action on 
the part of one or more persons engaged in some 
kind of business which gives exclusive control, more 
particularly, although not solely, with respect to 
price." He contends that monopoly must be dis- 
tinguished from concentration of wealth so far as 
accumulation is subject to competition. He here 
differs radically from the Socialists, who believe 
that all kinds of business inevitably tend toward 
monopoly. Mere mass of capital will not alone 
secure monopoly, because there is always a surplus 
of capital eager to find investment wherever there 
is a living chance in the competitive world. Talent 
for management never alone gives monopoly, but 
only unusual gains, since there is plenty of mana- 
gerial talent in the world waiting for employment. 
Real monopolies arise from social action, as the 
granting of patents, trade-marks, or special privi- 
leges ; or from natural causes, as limited supply of 
raw material, properties inherent in the business, or 
secrecy in the process of a manufacture. The the- 
oretical part of the work consists in the elucidation 
and enforcement of these ideas. The practical part 
deals, though briefly, with public control of real 
monopolies, when competition cannot enter to pro- 
tect public interests. Such public control the author 
declares to be an urgent and pressing social neces- 
sity. Among the suggested reforms are the re- 
striction of monopolistic corporations to normal 
returns on capital, with publicity of actual invest- 
ments and accounts. As this is extremely difficult 
in the case of certain kinds of business, the most 
promising method of control would be public own- 



ership. "Public ownership with public manage- 
ment renders control easy, because it is in the very 
nature of public property that it should be publicly 
controlled." It is also recommended that vast es- 
tates be broken up by regulation of bequests and 
inheritances ; that when tariffs make monopolies 
they should be abolished ; that patents be regulated 
so that inventors and the public may not be op- 
pressed by owners ; that governmental regulation of 
corporations by commissions be extended, etc. 



Tales from 
the Totemt. 



Many visitors to the World's Fair at 
Chicago noticed with much interest 
a miniature reproduction of a British 
Columbian Indian Town. The model was extremely 
accurate: not only the houses, but the curiously 
carved poles or columns standing near them, were 
carefully copied to scale. These carved columns 
differ in character : some are totemic, others are 
commemorative or mortuary. The little buildings 
were arranged in proper order upon an artifical 
beach, and a background of forested mountains was 
painted behind them. This interesting model (now 
at the Field Columbian Museum) was made under 
the direction of Mr. James Deans, who has lived in 
the Northwestern Coast country for twenty-five 
years. He is a Scotchman by birth and a practical 
geologist and prospector by profession. He has been 
over the whole country from Van Couver to Sitka, 
and is profoundly and sympathetically acquainted 
with the Indians. Mr. Deans was present at the 
World's Fair in charge of his exhibit, and explained 
the little village with its totemic and other carved 
posts to hundreds of visitors. This experience sug- 
gested to him the publication of a selection of stories, 
which he had gathered from the Indians themselves, 
most of which had reference to the totem carvings. 
The stories are now issued in book form, with the 
title " Tales from the Totems of the Hidery," form- 
ing Volume II. of the Archives of the International 
Folk-lore Association. The Hidery usually called 
Haidaz are favorites with Mr. Deans. The stories 
printed in this little book are mostly those connected 
with the carvings on the posts of the little village. 
They include stories of the raven (yethel) to whom 
man owes so much, of the eagle, the sun, moon, 
bear, frog, mountain goat, scannah, etc. The list 
includes stories representing two great classes of 
legends, cosmogonic and heroic. In telling the 
stories, Mr. Deans gives many interesting data re- 
garding the life, customs, and ideas of the Hidery. 
The style of the narration is simple and direct. 
The collection of stories is edited by Professor 
Griggs of the University of Chicago. 



Thefighting

Volumes II., III., and IV. of Dr. 
W. H. Fitchett's modestly entitled 
book "How England Saved Europe "

his title by showing how often, during the Napo- 
leonic wars, it was not the English, but the Celts,

the Scotch, and the Irish contingents of the British 
forces, that did the bulk of the fighting. To come 
nearer our own day, what sort of a showing must 
" Tommy Atkins " proper (though outnumbering 
his foes four to one) have made against the hardy 
South African ranchmen, without the support of the 
Scotch and Irish and Colonials ! It is time now, in 
the face of hard facts, to have done with the stale 
prejudice as to the preternatural fighting qualities 
of English troops. You cannot make a first-class 
fighting man and a good shot out of a cockney by 
clapping a red coat on him ; and the ludicrous fail- 
ure of the English attempt to raise in the rural dis- 
tricts a corps of " rough riders " on the American 
model shows what may be looked for from their 
"yeomanry." The English " yeoman," the bow- 
man of Crecy and Agincourt, belongs to ancient 
history, and England has long passed out of the 
stage that produced him. To get his like she must 
now look to ruggeder Scotland or the Colonies. Dr. 
Fitchett's work is a very readable and at times 
brilliant popular history of Great Britain's struggle 
by sea and land against Napoleon. The narrative 
is rapid, picturesque, and clean-cut, a little boastful 
perhaps, but not likely on that account to offend 
those for whom it is primarily written. Volume II. 
tells of Nelson and the struggle for the sea ; Volume 
III., of the war in the Peninsula ; and Volume IV. 
of Waterloo and St. Helena. No better popular 
history has been written of the long war that made 
Nelson and Wellington famous. The work is at- 
tractively mounted and well supplied with portraits. 

In the preface to her pretty book on 
"Salons Colonial and Republican" 
(Lippincott), Mrs. Anne Hollings- 
worth Wharton speaks with implied approval of the 
" deep and widespread interest " now felt in the 
America of our Colonial period. Every instructed 
person will agree with Mrs. Wharton that it is, 
generally speaking, a good sign when people take 
an interest in the early history of their own country, 
and show a desire to acquaint themselves with the 
beginnings of the society they live in. Books on 
Colonial times have multiplied greatly of late. 
Some of them the pleasant studies by Mrs. Earle, 
for example are useful and scholarly productions, 
written in the proper historical spirit and to a 
worthy end ; others merely reflect the passing 
attempt to make descent from the earlier immi- 
grants a mark of social superiority ; some of them 
appeal to the student, others appeal to the snob. 
The main element of general interest in Mrs. 
Wharton's book is, we should say, its artistic or 
pictorial one, namely, the great number of beau- 
tiful reproductions of choice old miniature portraits 
it contains. The original pictures from which these 
plates are taken are in many cases from eminent 
hands, and the collection must be pronounced an 
attractive and instructive one to all who take an 
interest in the now reviving branch of miniature- 
painting. Mrs. Wharton's rambling narrative serves

studies in Professor Edward Howard Griggs's 

personal and work, entitled "The New Human- 

social development. j 8m . Stadie8 in Personal and Social 

Development " (The American Society for the Ex- 
tension of University Teaching, Philadelphia), may 
be briefly described as an attempt at the working 
out of the results of spiritual and other ideals in 
our modern life ; or, in other words, the application 
of scientific method and study to personal and so- 
cial matters which are ordinarily regarded as beyond 
the pale of scientific investigation. The first of the 
ten papers, all distinct in subject and treatment, yet 
all making to a single end, is given to " The Scientific 
Study of the Higher Human Life." Successive 
essays bear such indicative titles as " The Dynamic 
Character of Personal Ideals," "The Modern 
Change in Ideals of Womanhood," and "The Ethics 
of Social Reconstruction." This last takes the posi- 
tion that "In all unfounded expectations of imme- 
diate social regeneration there are two errors: the 
mistake of imagining that progress can be sudden ; 
and the error of supposing that a condition of 
statical perfection is either possible or desirable 
in human society." From this the argument is 
carried through the concluding essays on "The New 
Social Ideal" and "The Religion of Humanity," for 
a wider understanding of our intellectual possibili- 
ties, apart from any preliminary system of social 
organization. The strong and undeviating optimism 
of the book as a whole, tempered as it is by the full 
recognition of existing social blunders, makes it at 
once stimulating and wholesome. 

It is surprising, to those who knew 
the popularity of the books of the 
late Edward Payson Roe, that twelve 
years should elapse before the appearance of any 
extended biography of him. Such a work is now 
published (Dodd, Mead & Co.), prepared with loving 
care by his sister, Miss Mary A. Roe, and is to be 
welcomed as an addition to American literary biog- 
raphies. So far as possible, Miss Roe has followed 
the safe plan of letting the author speak for himself, 
and more than half the book is made up of extracts 
from his letters and journals, given without change. 
These passages disclose a personality of great charm, 
and the book traces in an interesting way the career 
of the man who achieved the greatest literary popu- 
larity of his time in America. He was a graduate 
of Williams College and of a neighboring theo- 
logical school, and in 1862, before his studies were 
fully completed, he became the chaplain of the 
Harris Light Cavalry (Second New York), gaining 
experience in writing at the same time by acting as 
correspondent for the New York " Evangelist." He 
won golden opinions for his zeal and sympathy while 
in the service, becoming the chaplain of the Hamp-

We have already expressed much 
satisfaction with the Eversley " 
edition of Shakespeare, prepared for 
the Macmillan Co. by Professor C. H. Herford. 
Now that the editor is in this country, and is mak- 
ing many personal friends upon our side of the 
Atlantic, we are glad of the opportunity presented 
by a reissue of this work to call attention once more 
to its scholarly qualities and its attractive appear- 
ance. The original edition was in ten volumes ; the 
new one is in thirty-nine that is, a play to a volume, 
with two volumes for the poems. The notes are 
restricted to the essentials, and are found where all 
notes should be found, at the bottom of the page. 
This is distinctly a pocket edition of the poet, and, 
as such, it is a close rival of the " Temple " Shake- 
speare, appealing possibly to a severer taste, but to 
one no less refined. Professor Herford, who has 
recently given a course of Turnbull lectures at the 
Johns Hopkins University, is a nephew of the Rev. 
Brooke Herford who lived for many years in this 
country. He is one of the soundest of the younger 
English scholars in English and German literature. 
His translations of Dr. Ibsen's "Brand" and "Love's 
Comedy" are not the least of his many services to 
literature. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Edward Rowland Sill rarely, if ever, wrote anything 
for the mere sake of writing, and what might be called 
the flotsam and jetsam of his work is better worth pre- 
serving than much of the labored composition of more 
prolific writers. We have already had three small vol- 
umes of his verse; it has now remained for the pub- 
lishers (Houghton) to collect a companion volume of 
his " Prose " from such sources as the " Contributor's 
Club " of the " Atlantic Monthly " and other periodicals. 
We are given, besides a brief memoir illustrated by his 
letters, something like forty short pieces of prose, classi- 
fied under balf a dozen heads. They are all brief, but 
they are also packed with the writer's own thought, and 
we are heartily glad to have them thus preserved. 

" Makers of Literature " (Macmillan) is the title 
given by Professor George E. Woodberry to a collec- 
tion of critical essays which is an enlarged reissue of 
the volume of ten years ago which was called "Studies 
in Letters and Life." There are several additional 
chapters, however, so that the work is something more 
than a new edition. It comprises nineteen papers in all, 
relating almost wholly to nineteenth century writers, 
and includes " all of the author's critical work which it 
seems desirable to reprint." That it is a volume of 
unusual thoughtf ulness and weight goes almost without 
saying, and the reader, however much he may bring to 
its perusal, can count upon carrying away even more.

The plan of the series is intelligent, and its fulfilment 
will be awaited with interest. 

" The Popular Poetry of the Finns," by Mr. Charles J. 
Billson, and " The Fairy Mythology of Shakespeare," 
by Mr. Alfred Nutt, are two new pamphlets in the 
series, of which we spoke some months ago, entitled 
" Popular Studies in Mythology, Romance, and Folk- 
lore," published by Mr. David Nutt. 

Miss Louise C. Boname is both author and publisher 
of a small " Hand Book of Pronunciation for Advanced 
Grades," which students of the French language will 
find particularly useful in supplementing the informa- 
tion to be had from grammars and dictionaries, and 
which teachers will find equally useful in their work. 

"The Chaucer Canon," by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde, is " a discussion of the 
works associated with the name of Geoffrey Chaucer," 
and gives the tests which scholars apply in determining 
the authenticity of a given work. The volume is an in- 
dispensible supplement to the seven volumes of the 
"Oxford Chaucer." 

"A Guide to the Trees" (Stokes), by Miss Alice 
Lounsberry, is a companion volume to that writer's pop- 
ular " Guide to the Wild Flowers," and is provided with 
many illustrations, including sixty-four colored plates, 
besides a large number in black and white. These illus- 
trations are the work of Mrs. Ellis Rowan. Dr. N. L. 
Britton has written an introduction to the work. 

Messrs. Houghton, M it'll in, & Co. have just published 
a " Cambridge " edition, in a single volume, of " The 
Complete Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott." The 
text has been edited by Dr. Rolfe, and the arrange- 
ment is chronological. The biography is done by Mr. 
H. E. Scudder in a few graceful and compact pages. 
The body of notes is considerable and the usual vignette 
and portrait constitute the illustrations. 

The new Boston publishing house which has just been 
incorporated under the name of Noyes, Platt & Com- 
pany is the result of an arrangement between Messrs. 
Curtis & Cameron, publishers of the Copley Prints, and 
Messrs. Small, Maynard & Company, for cooperation 
between these two houses in the publication of certain 
books on art and illustrated books. The first work to 
bear the imprint of the new firm will be the official 
illustrated catalogue of the Fine Arts Exhibit of the 
United States at the Paris Exposition, which is to be 
published immediately. 

Those summer travellers whose thoughts are turn- 
ing, not toward the heats of crowded Paris, but toward 
the rest and coolness of the Rocky Mountains, will find 
much to attract and interest them in the new hand book 
of Colorado, prepared by that experienced traveller and 
forceful writer, Captain James W. Steele, and issued 
by the Passenger Department of the well-known " Bur- 
lington Route," Chicago. The illustrations of the little 
work are profuse and well executed, while the text gives 
not only a sense of the charm of the regions treated, 
but just those bits of information regarding routes of 
travel and points of greatest interest which the intend- 
ing traveller most needs. 

Mr. A. G. S. Josephson, of the Crerar Library, Chicago, 
sends us the following interesting note on two modern 
Swedish authors: In the review of European literature 



of the last twenty years, which was given in THE DIAL 
for May 1 last, no mention was made of Swedish liter- 
ature. Of course, Sweden cannot show such a literary 
giant as Henrik Ibsen, nor, perhaps, such a brilliant critic 
as Georg Brandes. But there are two Swedish authors 
who, even in a very rapid survey of contemporary lit- 
erature, should have been at least mentioned. Viktor 
Rydberg, who died in 1895, was without question the 
most commanding literary personality in Sweden since 
Geijer, and some regard him as its greatest poet since 
Tegne*r. His influence may have been more as a civiliz- 
ing force than as a purely literary one ; but whatever 
its kind, his influence upon the generations which have 
grown up since the early sixties has been most pro- 
found. The brilliant if erratic genius of August 
Strindberg, combining deep ethical pathos with a coarse 
and cynical manner of expression, has influenced recent 
Swedish literature more than that of anyone else. He 
seems now to have reached greater stability, and prom- 
ises to give us, in his Indian summer, works of deeper 
significance and perhaps higher artistic value than any 
of the productions of his youth or manhood.

The Things that Count 

12 mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 
In her well-known graphic style, Miss Tompkins 
has made a strong and vivid study of a character 
hitherto not delineated in American fiction. Her 
heroine is an indolent young woman of small means, 
who lives by visiting the houses of wealthy friends. 
The story of her regeneration through her affection 
for a man of strong character is cleverly told.

THE DIAL 



"A DEVOUT BLUEBEARD." 

This is a powerful work by ' ' Marie Graham , ' ' and a truthful 
satire on the snobbery of the day. A fascinating sketch of the early 
history of Chicago. The chief character is so well portrayed that few 
will fail to recognize him. It abounds in naturalness and witticisms. 
Price, One Dollar. May be ordered through any bookseller, or 
from the publishers, THE ABBEY PRESS, 114 Fifth Avenue, 
New York City.

OUR NATIVE TREES and How to Identify Them 

By HARRIET L. KEELER. With 178 fall-page plates from photographs, and 162 text-drawings. 

Crown 8vo, $2.00 net. 

Technically accurate, Miss Keeler's book is designed for popular use in the identification of the forest trees of 
Northeastern America, and in the study of their habits and peculiarities. The apparatus of the book is so full and so 
varied that the lover of nature will find it an indispensable companion. It is not a dry, technical manual, but has a 
high literary quality. It is copiously, richly, and helpfully illustrated. 

" The illustrations in this volume are worthy of special commendation." The Outlook.

" No popular work on botany has ever achieved such universal and deserved popularity as this volume of Mrs. Dana's. 

To those who love wild flowers it has proved a treasure, and with the additions now made it will be of yet greater

and flowers as well as the scientific terms." Boston Transcript.

CHOPIN: THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC 

By JAMES HUNEKER, author of "Mezzotints in Modern Music." With portrait. 12mo, $2.00. 
" Many of those who read Mr. Huneker's chapter on ' The Greater Chopin ' in his diverting and suggestive volume 
entitled ' Mezzotints in Modern Music ' must have hoped that he might find time and inclination to write a whole 
volume on that composer, who has gradually come to hold in the piano world the same commanding position that 
Wagner does in the field of opera. The hoped-for volume is now in existence and will at once take its place in the 
front rank of books on this subject." The Nation. 

THE WAYS OF MEN 

By ELIOT GREGORY, author of "Worldly Ways and By- Ways. 12mo, $1.50. 

" Mr. Eliot Gregory, who won his first fame under the pseudonym of ' An Idler,' is master of an agreeable style, 
of a happy turn in epigram, and a gentle but effective irony. Further, he possesses the gracious urbanity that comes 
from travel and observation from contact with many men of many climes. These good qualities are all apparent 
in his latest book, * The Ways of Men.' "New York Herald.

MR. CHURCHILL'S BOOK ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR. 

LONDON TO LADYSMITH 

VIA PRETORIA. 

By WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL, 

Special Correspondent of the " Morning Post " in South Africa, author of " The River War," etc. 

With 3 Folding Maps and Plans. Crown 8vo, 508 pages, $1.50. 

This book is the outcome of Mr. Churchill's experiences as a special correspondent with the British 
armies in South Africa from the early days of the war until the relief of Ladysmith ; and includes the 
story of the fight in the armored train, Mr. Churchill's detention at Pretoria as a prisoner of war, his 
escape and subsequent service with the Natal army. There are several maps throwing light on the 
operations and various plans, among them one of the States Model Schools in Pretoria where the British 
prisoners were confined. 



MR. WEYMAN'S 

NEW ROMANCE: 

A Romance of the Time of George II. By 

Crown 8vo, cloth, 

"Mr. Weyman's new romance illustrates the types 
and manners of fashionable London society in the year 
1742. In everything that means the revival of an his- 
torical atmosphere it is skilful, and, on the whole, just. 
The characters also are well realized. ... Sophia ' is 
a decidedly interesting novel. . . . The tale moves 
swiftly, hurrying on from the town to the heath, from 
hatred to love, from imprisonment on bread and water 
to diamonds . . . and a dozen other things. Sophia, 
the heroine, is a bundle of girlish foolishness and charms. 
' Sophia,' the book, is a bundle of more or less extra- 
ordinary episodes woven into a story in the most be- 
guiling manner." New York Tribune. 



SOPHIA 



STANLEY J. WEYMAN. With 12 illustrations, 
ornamental, $1.50. 

" ' Sophia ' contains, in its earlier part, a series of 
incidents that is, we believe, the most ingenious yet 
planned by its author. . . . The adventure develops 
and grows, the tension increases with each page, to 
such an extent that the hackneyed adjective ' breath- 
less ' finds an appropriate place. None, not even the 
most hardened and omnivorous novel reader, can fol- 
low the adventures of Sophia, her brother, Sir Hervey 
Coke, the adventuress, and the Irishman with many 
aliases, without being carried along by it at top speed 
until the end is reached, and Sir Hervey reveals him- 
self a knight in laced coat and silken stockings." 
Mail and Express (New York). 



ELISSA; 

Or, THE DOOM OF ZIMBABWE. 

By H. RIDER HAGGARD. With 13 illustrations. 

Crown 8vo, $1.25. 

In "Elissa" Mr. Haggard takes his readers to the Phoeni- 
cian city in South Central Africa, the mysterious ruins of which 
have been the subject of so much speculation and research in the 
recent past. How it happened that a trading town, protected 
by vast fortifications and adorned with many temples dedi- 
cated to the gods of the Sidonians, was built by civilized men 
in the heart of Africa may not be accurately known, but there 
is ample room for speculation as to the life of the ancient 
city, and in this romance the author has tried to picture inci- 
dents such as might have accompanied the first extinction of 
Zimbabwe. 

GOVERNMENT; 

Or, HUMAN EVOLUTION Justice. 

By EDMOND KELLY, M.A., F.G.S., sometime Lecturer 
on Municipal Government at Columbia University, 
in the City of New York, author of " Evolution and 
Effort." Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
" This book is an attempt to discuss the issues which stand 

at the foundation of all political discussions, and to come to 

some definite conclusions regarding them."

" We had not proceeded far into the story before we

A DREAM OF A THRONE. 

The Story of a Mexican Revolt. By CHARLES F. 
EMBREE. Illus. by HENRY SANDHAM. 12mo, $1.50. 

" A strong dramatic story of revolt against the Mexican 
Republic, led by a descendant of one of the Aztec kings. A 
field hitherto very little cultivated is entered. ... A power- 
ful story of war and love, with constantly changing move- 
ment, strong color, and striking effects." Philadelphia

THE KNIGHTS OF THE CROSS. 

By HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ, Author of Quo VADIS." 

Authorized and Unabridged Translation from the Polish by JEREMIAH CURTIN. 
Two Vols., Crown 8vo, Cloth; Price, $2.00. Vol. I. (Seventh Thousand), Price, $1.00. 

Vol. II. (Now Ready), Price, $1.00. 

This powerful historical romance, the latest work of this great author, is now issued complete in two volumes 
by special arrangement with Sienkiewicz, including maps, an historical note by the translator, and a portrait of 
Sienkiewicz and Jeremiah Curtin, from a photograph recently taken at Warsaw. Mr. Curtin's translation is the 
only complete one, and is imbued with the spirit and faithfulness to the original which distinguished his transla- 
tions of " Quo Vadis," " With Fire and Sword," " The Deluge," etc., and which caused Sienkiewicz to give him 
the sole authority to translate his books. 

"Of enthralling interest. It is certain that 'The Knights of the Gross ' will evoke quite as much enthusiasm as did the 
earlier works by the same author." The Philadelphia Telegraph. 

" It seems superior even to ' Quo Vadis ' in strength and realism." The Churchman. 

" Equals in force, variety, and tremendous exposition of primitive passions his famous Polish 'trilogy' ' With Fire and 
Sword,' ' The Deluge,' and ' Pan Michael.' . . . The story, once fairly entered upon, holds the attention relentlessly." 
The Outlook.

THE COMMENCEMENT SEASON. 

This is the time of the year when schools and 
colleges all over the country are engaged in 
closing up their work, and in dismissing into 
the world of action the thousands of young men 
and women who have, as the phrase goes, com- 
pleted their education. They are, for the most 
part, a hopeful body of young people, and those 
who witness the final flourish of the exercises 



which mark for these graduates the "com- 
mencement " of their influence upon a wider 
world than that of their Alma Mater must be 
cynical indeed if they do not find this spirit of 
hopefulness contagious. When should we take 
hope for the future, if not in the presence of 
these young and eager minds, conscious of their 
rich inheritance from the past, and confident 
of their power to recast the future into their 
own glowing mould ? However our own gen- 
eration may have disappointed us, we still have 
faith in the generation that is to come after us, 
and deep down in most of our hearts there is 
an invincible belief that somehow, somewhere, 
the ideals that have been thwarted in our own 
time by the brute forces of selfishness and ma- 
terialism are destined to have a better chance 
of realization in the near future. If our own 
mood have become that of the " Locksley Hall " 
of the poet's ripe age, we would not have it 
shared by the younger generation, and are 
glad that the mood which inspired the earlier 
" Locksley Hall " still invades the ardent 
imaginings of youth, and shapes them to the 
same fair dream. 

It is not alone because of the hope that 
springs eternal that we who have suffered the 
disillusionment of advancing years still cling to 
a belief in the promise and the potency of the 
youth that is just taking the world's burden 
upon its shoulders. We are not altogether 
without rational grounds for that belief. It is 
to the progress of education that we must look 
for the accomplishment of all those things 
which are not, yet which ought to be, and no 
one can follow the educational developments of 
recent years without taking heart for the race, 
or without anticipating a marked practical out- 
come from so great an amount of intelligent 
and harmoniously concerted effort. Whether 
we examine the bare statistics, with their show- 
ing of increased educational opportunities, of a 
better appreciation of the meaning of educa- 
tion, of the strong hold of humanism upon our 
systems despite the assaults made upon it in 
the name of practicality, or whether we attend 
to the philosophical generalizations of those 
observers who, from year to year, survey the 



458 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



field of recent activity and sum up the results 
accomplished, we are not without abundant 
cause for encouragement and self-congratula- 
tion. That much has been done, and done in 
the right way, is undeniable ; we have many 
reasons to believe that the young of to-day are 
given a better equipment with which to face 
the world than was provided for the young of 
twenty or thirty years ago. 

And yet, with all the obvious reasons for 
our feeling satisfied with what the educational 
activity of the present time is accomplishing, 
we must reckon with the fact that some of the 
prevailing tendencies of educational thought 
are viewed with mistrust, and even with alarm, 
by many of the best observers, by profound and 
weighty thinkers whose views command the 
greatest respect. Amid the clamor of peda- 
gogical novelty and radicalism the still small 
voice of these protestants penetrates to the 
attentive ear, and bids us reexamine the funda- 
mental articles of the current orthodoxy. One 
such voice is that of Professor Miinsterberg, 
whose recent " Atlantic " article on " School 
Reform " deserves the most careful considera- 
tion. Let us take the case of the average 
graduate from the school or college of to-day. 
Comparing him with the graduate of a genera- 
tion ago, we may admit at once that he has 
been in the hands of instructors of more accu- 
rate scholarship, that he has had better library 
and laboratory aids, that more helpful text- 
books have guided his studies. These things 
are all good, but they are not fundamental. 
What is really fundamental is, for example, 
what Professor Miinsterberg, writing of the 
tendency to allow young people to select the 
subjects which are the most interesting, ex- 
presses in the following terms : " A child who 
has himself the right of choice, or who sees 
that parents and teachers select the courses 
according to his tastes and inclinations, may 
learn a thousand pretty things, but never the 
one which is the greatest of all : to do his 
duty. He who is allowed always to follow the 
paths of least resistance never develops the 
power to overcome resistance ; he remains 
utterly unprepared for life. To do what we 
like to do, that needs no pedagogical encour- 
agement ; water always runs down hill. Our 
whole public and social life shows the working 
of this impulse, and our institutions outbid one 
another in catering to the taste of the public. 
The school alone has the power to develop the 
opposite tendency, to encourage and train the 
belief in duties and obligations, to inspire de- 



votion to better things than those to which we 
are drawn by our lower instincts." For a stu- 
dent to choose his own courses may make his 
education both easy and pleasant ; it certainly 
does not develop the power to overcome resist- 
ance. That power is developed only by work 
that is not easy, and that sometimes is extremely 
unpleasant. " The schools were bad, and the 
public was dissatisfied," says our writer ; " now 
the elective studies relieve the discomfort of 
the children ; in the place of the old vexation 
they have a good time, and the parents are glad 
that the drudgery is over." Presently, how- 
ever, there is a rude awakening, and it is dis- 
covered that the children thus taught have 
acquired no mental stamina, that they do not 
know anything thoroughly, that they cannot 
grapple with any hard problem of practical life. 
Then the man who is strong on psychology and 
pedagogy gets his chance. For the possession 
of this apparatus "he is not a better teacher, 
but he can talk about the purposes of the new 
education till all is covered by beautiful words ; 
and thus parents and children are happily satis- 
fied for a while, till the time comes when the 
nation has to pay for its neglect." " Just as 
it has been said that war needs three things, 
money, money, and again money, so it can be 
said with much greater truth that education 
needs, not forces and buildings, not pedagogy 
and demonstrations, but only men, men, and 
again men. . . . The right kind of men is 
what the schools need. They need teachers 
whose interest in the subject would banish all 
drudgery." 

One of the dialogues of Lucian speaks 
we quote from Froude's paraphrase of " lies 
related so circumstantially and by such grave 
authorities, with evidence of eye-witnesses, 
place, and time all accurately given, that the 
strongest mind could hardly resist conviction 
unless fortified with the certainty that such 
things could not be." Our credulous age is 
beset by innumerable lies of this character, lies 
of popular science, of political controversy, of 
religious propaganda, of every species of intel- 
lectual quackery. It is surely both funda- 
mental and vital to ask of our education 
whether it fortifies the mind with the certainty 
that such things cannot be. Does the average 
product of our most approved educational sys- 
tems know the demonstrated facts of physics, 
of economic science, of the historical experi- 
ence of mankind, with absolute conviction, or 
does he stand toward them in a hazy mental 
attitude, doubtful of their validity, and ready

to surrender them at the behest of some plaus- 
ible word-monger ? This attitude toward fun- 
damental principles is so widely prevalent, even 
among people who have gone through the form 
of intellectual training, that the answer to our 
question does little credit to whatever agencies 
are responsible for such an intellectual outlook. 
For a period that boasts of enlightenment, the 
" forts of folly " are still defended by forces 
whose numbers are, to say the least, disheart- 
ening. Both intellectually and morally, the 
educational methods most in vogue in the 
schools of to-day, in spite of all the zeal and 
energy behind them, seem somehow to fail 
when we look below the surface of their results. 
The sterner if less ingenious methods of the 
past did succeed in evolving that type of " gen- 
tleman and scholar " which seems to be fast 
disappearing, and the passing of which from 
our life has recently been lamented by Pro- 
fessor Emerton. The personal influence of the 
teacher has become lessened, and the pressure of 
the educational machinery has become greater. 
And there is much food for reflection in these 
words of the writer just mentioned : " The 
highly developed machine is able by its very 
perfection to give to comparatively poor ma- 
terial an apparent finish, which may deceive 
the unwary. . . . Our machinery will enable 
us to turn out men trained to certain definable 
forms of mental activity, men who can be tick- 
eted off in groups and applied in various kinds 
of work in the world. It will never give us 
any guaranty that these are men of real intellect- 
ual power, whose personal quality can of itself 
command respect." How far our insistence 
upon the machine-made quality may go is illus- 
trated by the growing tendency among edu- 
cational administrators to recruit their forces 
only from the ranks of men having the profes- 
sional trade-mark. Professor Emerton makes 
this pertinent quotation from Erasmus : " For- 
merly a man was called ' doctor ' because he 
was a learned man ; but nowadays no one will 
believe a man is learned unless he is called 
4 doctor.' " And the writer adds, in words that 
are none too strong, this statement of his own 
experience : " I have known many a man, 
whose great fundamental need was intellectual 
refinement and culture, sacrificed to this semi- 
civilized demand for a certifiable kind of expert 
training." The educational tendency which 
can be content thus to substitute a narrow and 
easy test of ability for those broad and search- 
ing tests which alone are of real value, is not 
exactly a cause for congratulation. Here also 



a fundamental principle is involved, and we 
should look to it that the tendency be not suf- 
fered to impair our education in a very vital 
respect. The above are a few only of the re- 
flections that must intrude upon serious minds 
whenever educational questions come to the 
front, and that cannot fail to exert a sobering 
influence upon our enthusiasm. 



A STUDY IN BENEVOLENCE. 

Some material for an interesting study is to be 
found in the list of public gifts and bequests made 
in the United States during 1899 or becoming oper- 
ative in that year, compiled by Mr. Rossiter John- 
son, editor of " Appletons' Annual Cyclopedia." 
The compiler records only those gifts which amount 
to five thousand dollars or over, and only those 
made by private individuals ; public contributions, 
denominational gifts, and governmental appropria- 
tions are excluded. For obvious reasons, the list 
must be more or less incomplete; yet there are 
here recorded donations which aggregate nearly 
$63,000,000, thirty-eight per cent more than 
those of any previous year. The list is presented 
in such compactness that several striking facts 
are likely to escape the general reader, unless 
these facts are given the emphasis of distinct state- 
ment. 

In the first place, it may be noted that while the 
bequests of sixty-seven persons are recorded in the 
published list, the direct gifts of a hundred and 
forty, or more than twice as many, are mentioned. 
Evidently, more than ever before our wealthy 
classes are distributing their wealth while they live, 
rather than leaving their property to the uncertain- 
ties of an administered estate. Furthermore, while 
twenty-five per cent of these bequests those 
which reach or surpass the $100,000 mark 
amount to $16,000,000, twenty-six of the direct 
gifts, similarly selected, aggregate $32,000,000, 
or twice the former sum. Secondly, it appears 
that of two hundred and seven benefactors selected 
from the list, fifty-seven or about twenty -eight 
per cent are women. Nineteen out of two hundred 
and seven philanthropists, representing more than 
a million and a half in gifts, have not permitted 
public announcement of their names. 

An exact classification of all these benefactions 
is not easy ; but allowing for the unavoidable im- 
perfections of the published list, the amounts con- 
tributed to these specific objects are approximately 
correct : 

1. Religions and denominational organizations, 

missions, etc $ 4,661,500 

2. Hospitals and asylums 7,095,000 

3. The fine arts, public monuments . . . . . 799,350 

4. Public libraries 1,599,000 

5. Universities, colleges, schools 31,469,000

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



It is worthy of note that of the amount devoted 
to public libraries, Mr. Andrew Carnegie gave 
$1,130,000, establishing, or contributing to the 
establishment of, seventeen new public libraries in 
thirteen different states. Mr. Carnegie was, with 
one exception, the largest giver of the year, the sum 
of his benefactions amounting to $5,000,000. 

But the item of greatest importance in this sum- 
mary is the last, which records the donations to 
universities, colleges, and technical schools. Sixty- 
eight institutions were thus remembered ; and in 
the distribution of these gifts, the East, the Middle 
West, the Pacific Coast, and the Southern States 
are all fairly represented. Gifts ranging from 
$5,000 to $100,000 were received by thirty-three 
colleges and universities; fifteen institutions re- 
ceived sums ranging from $100,000 to $600,000. 
In this last group Yale was the largest beneficiary, 
receiving $528,000. 

Eight colleges for women received an aggregate 
of $311,000, an average of less than $40,000. Of 
these eight, Vassar received the largest amount, 
$96,000. Wellesley follows with 90,000, and the 
Woman's College of Baltimore is reported with 
$50,000. 

The " big six " among the universities were : 

1. Princeton, which received $ 1,032,000 

2. University of Pennsylvania, which received . 1,180,000 

3. Washington, which received 1.300,000 

4. Columbia, which received 1,381,000 

5. Harvard, which received 2,230,000 

6. Leland Stanford, Jr., which received . . . 15,000,000 

These gifts amount to $22,123,000 

Adding the gifts to the 48 3,828,000 

We have a total of $25,951,000 

The benefactions of Mr. Rockefeller to the Uni- 
versity of Chicago are not included here because of 
the conditions making his gift ineffective before the 
present year. 

Let us now look at the amounts credited to the 
industrial, art, and technical schools. Tuskegee, 
the flourishing institution over which Mr. Booker 
T. Washington presides with such marked success, 
was remembered to the extent of $127,000. Hamp- 
ton Industrial Institute is credited with $28,000. 
The largest beneficiaries in this group were, as 
reported : 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston . $ 650,000 

Armour Institute, Chicago 750,000 

Bradley Polytechnic, Peoria 1,000,000 

Cooper Union, New York 1,000,000 

Carnegie Institute, Pittsbnrg 1,750,000 

The remaining ten received 400,000 

Making a total of $5,550,000 

Adding the donations to the colleges and 

universities 25,951,000 

We have a grand total of $31,501,000 

With the exception of the sums given to establish 
public libraries, we have been considering thus far 
benefactions bestowed only on existing institutions. 
The following items are perhaps the most interest- 
ing in the complete list : 

1. For the education of deserving boys and girls unable to 



attend the higher schools, Elizabeth Larkin, of Chicago, be- 
queathed her entire estate of $35,000. 

2. For a free industrial school for young women, the Rev. 
P. J. Daly, of Boston, gave $50,000. 

3. For the benefit of orphan boys, a home and industrial 
school is provided by Mr. Henry A. Pevear, of Lynn, Mass., 
valuation, $300,000. 

4. To establish an institution in Ohio for the free education 
of girls, Mr. Wallace C. Andrews, of New York, gave $500,000. 

5. Mr. George W. Clayton, of Denver, bequeathed to that 
city for an orphans' college, $1,000,000. 

6. To establish a school of pedagogy, comprising a kinder- 
garten, primary, and grammar schools, high school and junior 
college, situated near Lincoln Park, Chicago, and also a 
thoroughly appointed school for the children of the poor, on 
Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, Mrs. Enimons Blaine gave 
$1,000,000. 

7. Twenty-five years ago, Mr. John Simmons, of Boston, 
left a portion of his estate for the establishment of a college 
for women. This bequest is now effective, having amounted, 
under investment, to $2,000,000. 

8. James Munyon, of Philadelphia, has given to that city 
thirty acres of land near Fairmount Park, whereon are to be 
erected buildings for a home and school for dependent girls, 
similar in purpose to Qirard College for boys. These build- 
ings are planned to cost $2,000,000. 

9. Peter A. Widener, of Philadelphia, has purchased thirty- 
six acres of land in the suburbs of that city, whereon he will 
erect a combined home, hospital, and industrial school for the 
benefit of crippled children ; to cost $2,000,000. 

Thus the gifts of these nine persons to the cause of 
higher education for young women, to the protec- 
tion and industrial training of the children of the 
poor, amount in round numbers to $9,000,000. 

Unprecedented as were the donations of 1899, 
those of 1900 are almost certain to surpass them. 
Before half the year has expired, these already 
amount to nearly or quite $20,000,000. Washing- 
ton University has received additional gifts to the 
amount of $5,000,000 ; the University of Chicago 
has come into full possession of the millions secured 
by the latest Rockefeller gift ; Harvard, Columbia, 
Vanderbilt, Washington and Lee, Yale, Bowdoin, 
and Brown have all benefited by generous dona- 
tions ; and to this list might be added the names of 
other colleges, as well as of libraries and art mu- 
seums similarly enriched. It is interesting to note 
that of these benefactions recorded during the five 
months just passed, nine-tenths of the sums are 
given outright by donors who are still living to see 
their desires fulfilled, and to take some satisfaction, 
doubtless, in observing the goodly results of their 
munificence. 

Thirty-five years ago, John Rnskin in a public 
lecture forcibly arraigned the English people for the 
spirit of commercialism which seemed to him to be 
sapping the intellectual and spiritual life of the 
nation. " We have despised literature," he said. 
"We have despised science. We have despised 
art. We have despised compassion." The spirit 
of commercialism is as insidious as ever. It may 
be that even in the devotion of these unwonted sums 
to literature, to science, to art, to compassion, some 
traces of commercialism may be discovered, al- 
though the insinuation is gratuitous, the presumption 
being quite the reverse. Nevertheless, there are 
developing certain economic problems in the exist- 



1900.]

eno.e of these tremendously capitalized educational 
corporations, and these problems are worth consid- 
eration. It is a fact that the Stanford University 
is the wealthiest institution, privately established, 
in the world. Mrs. Stanford's gift of $15,000,000 
(cash value of property transferred) during the 
year just passed, swells the endowment of the uni- 
versity to $45,000,000, although the face value of 
the securities which constitute its investments now 
amounts to $80,000,000, and this valuation is rather 
likely to increase than to diminish. The University 
of California, the University of Chicago, as well as 
Columbia and Harvard, are almost rivals with the 
Stanford University in the sums of their respective 
endowments, while each new year seems destined 
to surpass its predecessor in the amount of fresh 
capital which it brings to these enterprises. 

How impressive should be the thought of the tre- 
mendous responsibilities involved responsibilities 
of administration on the part of those who direct 
the activities of these institutions ; the responsibility 
of provision and recognition on the part of the 
people and the nation to which they belong ; the 
responsibility of appreciation, and, may we add, of 
justification, which lies upon those for whose imme- 
diate good they are designed and those who are 
actively enjoying the splendid advantages which 
they provide. W. E. SIMONBS.

THE STAGE-COACH THEORY OP COLLEGE 

MANAGEMENT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The leading article in your last number tempts me to 
call attention to a significant feature in the parallel 
between stage-coach and university, drawn by a recent 
writer in " The Atlantic." According to that edifying 
parable, the college president is a man; the professors 
are horses. Over these essentially inferior creatures he 
naturally cracks his whip. They are horses; and, more- 
over, in this typical team they are all bad horses old, 
blind, weak-kneed, freakish, stupid, raw, vicious. The 
driver, coming " out of the tavern," jerks the reins with 
obvious ill- temper; the unfortunate beasts not pro- 
tected, in this o'er-true tale, by any " Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals " must endure him 
as they can. Meanwhile, the riotous young passengers 
(a new method in education) are bound whither ? 
To their several lots and stations in a republican gov- 
ernment. Shades of our forefathers! What training 
and example have we here for citizens of the American 
republic ? Or is it to be the American despotism ? 
An English scholar who has been many years resident 
in our country says that this " Land of the Free " has 
developed the two most absolute tyrants of modern 
times: the Political Boss and the College President. 
But as yet not all college presidents are of the type 
portrayed and betrayed in the " Atlantic " article. 
When that day comes, let them draw their faculty from 
something lower than mankind.

SCHOTJL,ERS HISTORY OF THE 
CIVIL, WAR.* 

Twenty years ago, writing from North Con- 
way, New Hampshire, under date of July 15, 
1880, Mr. James Schouler prepared the preface 
for the first volume of a " History of the United 
States under the Constitution." He planned 
to follow the footsteps of Richard Hildreth to 
1821, and then move forward by himself to the 
Civil War period, thus supplementing the 
work of Bancroft and Hildreth in making a 
complete story of the development of the Amer- 
ican people from the discovery of the continent 
to the close of the Rebellion. In this preface 
he declared that it was just ten years to a day 
since he laid aside the first draft of an intro- 
ductory chapter of the History which he 
planned to write " without fear or favor." A 
whole generation, therefore, has passed away 
since the study was begun, a generation daring 
which wonderful changes have taken place in 
American thought and American life. No ex- 
amination of Mr. Schouler's History would be 
fair which did not keep these great changes in 
mind. 

The underlying thought of the author is like- 
wise to be remembered. Recent biographical 
memoirs being considered as he wrote, he made 
these statements in his first preface : 

" Political biography distorts events necessarily to 
give effect to a personal example; for the public pro- 
gress of a new republic and of a people like ours is the 
advance of a swelling host whose force and direction 
are determined by a myriad of influences, while individ- 
uals who contribute their strength rise into view and then 
disappear. It is to trace this general advance, and dis- 
tinguish these impelling influences, whether individual 
or collective, political, moral, or social, that one should 
devote himself in a work like the present; and in pur- 
suance of such an object, I have availed myself of what- 
ever fresh materials such writers and collectors furnish, 
without relying implicitly upon any one of them." 

This purpose to seek the " impelling influ- 
ences " which have entered into the political, 
moral, and social life of the United States has 
been kept steadfastly in view as Mr. Schouler 
has worked away on his history during the 
intervals of other literary labors since 1870. 
The chapters in the several volumes which at- 
tempt a summary of these influences are the ones 
which give character to the work. They are 
interesting and suggestive, valuable alike for

what they contain and for what they indicate 
as yet available for the student who may wish 
to seek further light upon any phase of our 
country's progress. And yet in connection 
with these chapters a marked defect is to be 
noted ; for again and again, as special interest 
is awakened by the graphic portrayal of events, 
an exceedingly indefinite and disappointing 
reference, such as to " newspapers of the day," 
discourages personal research and checks the 
development of habits of additional private 
investigation which are so strongly advocated 
in these days of topical study. 

Along with this notable defect of indefinite- 
ness of references, the several volumes by Mr. 
Schouler are marked by infelicities of style 
which mar many otherwise strong passages. The 
thought is not expressed with sufficient clear- 
ness, the sentences are long and involved, and 
very often subject and predicate are lost in a 
maze of words. Two quotations from the sixth 
volume will illustrate this point : 

" Upon McClellan's repulse on the peninsula, had 
been arranged, with the state governors, the new levy 
of three hundred thousand men" (page 222). 

"... But the latter stood obstinately and corps by 
corps, division by division, of the heroic and devoted 
Potomac army were shattered in terrible carnage " 
(page 235). 

Infelicities of expression and indefiniteness of 
citations being overlooked, however, the work 
is a highly valuable contribution to American 
literature, and will probably serve for years as 
the standard reference for the general history 
of the United States under the Constitution 
down to 1865. The second volume appeared 
in 1882, the third in 1885, the fourth in 1889, 
and the fifth, intended for the final one, in 
1891. The preface of this fifth volume, how- 
ever, indicated a desire, should health and 
strength permit, to write a sixth volume de- 
scriptive of Lincoln's administration ; and it is 
this, bound separately also as a " History of 
the Civil War," which has now come from the 
press to complete the series. The first pub- 
lishing arrangements were unfortunate, and the 
History did not meet favorable comment or 
attract general attention until the present pub- 
lishers took hold of it. Since then the several 
volumes have been received with interest as 
they have appeared. 

The volume on the Civil War begins with 
a portrayal of the thoughts of the people as 
they looked forward to the administration of a 
man who was untried in national life and whose 
capacity for the responsible position many 
doubted. It closes with the thoughts of the 



same people as they looked back over the four 
years of trial and anxiety during which the 
strength of the President became more and 
more apparent until in an unhappy hour the 
assassin struck him down. The period is by 
far the most difficult of American history, for 
the shelves are full of books written in support 
of this theory or that, in defense or censure of 
generals and commanders. Mr. James Ford 
Rhodes worked over the great mass of material, 
and reached conclusions which he made clear 
in the recently published fourth volume of his 
history. Mr. Schouler has examined the same 
sources, and in quite a number of controverted 
matters has reached substantially the same re- 
sult. Leaving controversy out of consideration, 
however, several distinct features of this vol- 
ume are to be noted. There are five points 
connected with this History of the Civil War 
that are worth special attention. 

1. The "conspiracy" idea is everywhere. 
The Southern Confederacy is called a conspir- 
acy, planned by men who were capable of 
stooping to any means to accomplish their end. 
Many of them were West Pointers who violated 
their oath of allegiance to the United States, 
betrayed the country which had educated them, 
basely deserted it in the hour of peril, the ex- 
cuses which they set forth being poor ones. 
Nothing, our author thinks, can excuse the act 
of Lee, especially when his treason is compared 
with the loyalty of other Virginians. The ships 
are sent to distant ports; representatives are 
sent to European cities to plead the South- 
ern cause ; forts are seized, and yet commis- 
sioners are appointed to negotiate for the 
division of United States property as if no overt 
act had been committed. The fears for the 
cause of State Sovereignty are very soon lost 
sight of, as President Davis becomes an auto- 
crat of the most determined kind, ruling with 
a rod of iron. It is a conspiracy in the interest 
of slavery. 

" The soul of the Southern revolution of 1861, the 
nucleus of its absorbing passion, was historically the 
zeal of founding a new or reunited union of States 
whose corner-stone should be negro slavery, the sub- 
jection of the colored to the white race as a normal and 
natural condition." 

2. Much attention is paid to men. Through- 
out the several volumes of the history, Mr. 
Schouler has made it a rule to stop occasionally 
to look at the actors upon the stage, comment- 
ing upon them and describing their character- 
istics in terse words. In the sixth volume this 
biographical feature is marked, the studies of 
Seward, Stanton, and Chase, on the one side, 



1900.]

and Davis, Lee, and Toombs, on the other, 
being conspicuous examples. McClellan finds 
little favor in the final analysis. His organizing 
ability is praised, but there is constant blame 
for his inaction, his obstinacy, his contempt of 
the administration. 

"In his sublime egotism he viewed himself as the 
sole preserver of the people, not in a military sense 
alone, but against what he deemed the political infatua- 
tion of the party and men in power." 

All through the volume there is opportunity 
for comparison between McClellan and Grant. 
The one constantly magnifies the enemy's force ; 
the other thinks the chances of disorganization 
on the part of his adversary as great as on his 
own, and risks attack. The one plans strategic 
movements trying to capture places ; the other 
cares little for places if he can capture the 
enemy. If McClellan fails to win admiration, 
just as certainly the author has a warm spot in 
his heart for Grant ; and when the latter comes 
to the front as the great leader of the war, the 
reader recalls that many generals have been 
given an opportunity, and that at the last names 
appear in the relative rank which should be 
given them, the reasons for this ranking being 
plainly apparent. 

3. The difficulties in the situation are ad- 
mirably handled. Not to mention others, the 
trials of the administration in dealing with 
people in the North who were disposed to give 
aid and comfort to the enemy, the delicacy of 
treatment required in the case of the Border 
States, and the more complex diplomatic diffi- 
culties with foreign powers, each of these topics 
is discussed in an instructive manner. This 
leads to the mention of a fourth feature of the 
volume. 

4. Certain topics are presented with much 
power. Good examples are the fiasco of Fre- 
mont in Missouri, the invasion of Maryland by 
Lee, and the corresponding movement of Bragg 
into Kentucky which was attended by like fail- 
ure of the Border States men to rise in the 
interest of the Confederacy. Few descriptions 
can be better than that of the fight at Fred- 
ericksburg, while on the other hand the brilliant 
attempt of Pickett at Gettysburg does not 
inspire a notable paragraph. But as a rule the 
descriptions are good, and this fact keeps the 
interest of the reader from flagging in the 
midst of technicalities of campaigns. 

5. A fifth feature of the work is the bold- 
ness of outline which remains in the mind of 
the student because of the reiteration of certain 
essential details. The gradual evolution of the 



military leaders has already been mentioned, 
as has been the marked predilection for Grant. 
Of like nature is the feeling of Lincoln in regard 
to the loyal people of East Tennessee, or the 
jealousies among Confederate leaders, little 
things apparently, and yet in the long run 
quite important in shaping campaigns and in 
affecting the purposes and performances of 
leaders on both sides. The repetition of the 
statements regarding such things does not 
weaken the narrative, because the occasions for 
calling attention to them are many. 

Finally, the volume is strong in the discus- 
sion of phases of the war distinct from the 
actual fighting. The fifty pages given to a 
consideration of the soldiers of the war and of 
general traits and industries of the people are 
exceedingly interesting. The same thing is 
true of half as many pages which treat specifi- 
cally of the volunteers, the black soldiers, the 
care or lack of care of prisoners, and the en- 
forcement of the draft. The same faults which 
appear in the earlier volumes by this author 
are manifested in the closing one ; the same 
excellences are likewise apparent. On the whole, 
students of American history are to be con- 
gratulated on the fact that the literature of the 
Civil War has been enriched by two such nota- 
ble additions as the histories by Mr. Rhodes 
and Mr. Schouler.

HISTORY OF MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.* 

The aim and scope of the Rev. Alfred Wes- 
ley Wishart's " Monks and Monasteries" is " to 
sketch the history of the monastic institution 
from its origin to its overthrow in the Reforma- 
tion period." The work is distinctly a sketch, 
for despite its large proportions the book is but 
slightly over four hundred pages. The author 
in a sense disarms criticism in the beginning 
by frankly admitting that he has hardly touched 
the original sources at all, " although interme- 
diate authorities have been studied as widely 
as possible." What these are, we may pre- 
sume the appended bibliography sets forth ; 
but in justice to Mr. Wishart, this either should 
be enlarged (and pruned) or omitted altogether. 
It is not edifying to see text-books like Church's 
" Beginnings of the Middle Ages " and Stille's 
" Studies in Medieval History," Scott's " Mon-

astery," Sienkiewicz's " Knights of the Cross," 
and so bigoted a book as R. W. Thompson's 
" Footprints of the Jesuits," comporting with 
Harnack and Neander and Stubbs and Schaff. 
Moreover, this bibliography is as unfortunate 
in its omissions as in what it includes. 

The author is happiest in the beginning and 
the end of his theme. The rise and develop- 
ment of Monasticism he traces in an interesting 
way, even if one does tire of too frequent quo- 
tation mostly from Kingsley and long for 
an expression of opinion in the author's own 
words. 

Monasticism was not entirely of Christian 
origin. Oriental religions and practices, Greek 
philosophy, and Judaistic influences, all had a 
part in its formation. Asceticism and isolation, 
its two elemental characteristics, were common 
to both Judaism and pagan cults before Chris- 
tianity came into being. The Nazarenes of 
Scripture were primitive ascetics. Moses, 
Elijah, John the Baptist, Christ himself, sought 
the solitude of the desert. Buddha and Ma- 
homet, founders of non - Christian religions, 
did the same. The new dispensation of Chris- 
tianity could not be wholly divorced from its 
sources, nor could it cast off the influences of 
its environment. The union of Greek thought, 
which so accentuated the distinction between 
mind and matter, with the teachings of Chris- 
tianity that union which made St. John the 
mystic of the ages, gave monasticism most of 
its philosophic and spiritual basis. Rome gave 
it the law ; the Orient contributed that fanati- 
cism, amounting to a sort of hysteria, which 
so characterized Eastern monasticism. 

It was natural, therefore, that monastic 
practices should gradually obtain in the Church. 
It was natural, too, that monasticism should 
originate in Egypt. The central position of 
Egypt, at the angle of Europe, Africa, and 
Asia, made that country the common ground 
of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Oriental 
thought. Moreover, the atmosphere and to- 
pography of Egypt was most favorable to 
monasticism. The numberless natural cav- 
erns and excavations in the low hills of the 
Nile valley provided the primitive ascetic a 
dwelling-place. The dryness of the climate and 
his own isolation made him independent of 
much clothing or furniture, and the scant sus- 
tenance which his life required dates and 
millet could be easily provided. The first 
monks, like Paul of Thebes (circa 262-340) 
and St. Anthony (251-350), adopted that 
manner of living without reference to others 



who might be doing the same. But the holy 
living and holy dying of men like these, the 
persecution which drbve thousands into the 
desert places, united with fanatical zeal, vastly 
increased the movement, so that at the end of 
the fourth century it has been estimated that 
the number of hermits and cenobites in Egypt 
almost equalled the population in the cities. 

It was inevitable that organization should 
develop out of this circumstance, and so grad- 
ually the hermit of the desert becomes the 
monk of the cloister. Two great names are 
associated with this transition from the solitary 
to the cenobitic life. Pachomius (292-348) 
established a brotherhood of monks on the 
island of Tabenne in the Nile, who lived under 
the triple rule of poverty, chastity, and obedi- 
ence. Basil the Great (329-379), a Greek of 
character and ability, founded a similar clois- 
ter in Pontus, near the Black Sea ; and Basil's 
Rule fixing the details of life within and with- 
out the walls of the monastery, supplemented 
by numerous decisions of councils and em- 
perors, which Justinian united into a code for 
the monasteries of the Empire, became the 
organic law of the Eastern brotherhoods. 

From the fourth century onwards monastic 
foundations multiplied rapidly in the East. 
At the death of Constantine in 337 there were 
fifteen monasteries in the Empire. In 536 
there were ninety. The reasons of this increase 
are not hard to find. The intense and artifi- 
cial civilization of the Later Roman Empire 
created a craving for some new sensation or 
novelty, and monasticism satisfied that ennui 
which was eating at the hearts of so many. 
The Church saw in the enthusiasm a new means 
to idealize the Christian life of self-sacrifice. 
Martyrdom was no longer possible ; the live 
heat of that burning enthusiasm which had up- 
lifted the hearts of early converts in the stormy 
hour of torture was becoming chilled. 

But the excessive tendency to multiply the 
monasteries, united with the extravagance of 
some practices of the monks, by the middle of 
the fifth century had become a serious source 
of disquietude to the government. Men rushed 
into the cloister to evade taxes, to escape ser- 
vice in the army, or to find an easy means of 
living at the expense of pious and generous 
Christians. Relatives were confined there by 
their own kin. Fugitive slaves, runaway hus- 
bands, and sometimes criminals, found refuge 
there. Ambitious and frivolous monks asso- 
ciated with those of true faith. The vow of 
personal poverty did not prevent the acquisition

of corporate wealth by the brotherhood, so that 
luxury and ribaldry crept into the houses. Life 
according to the Rule (regula) became impos- 
sible. In 451, at the Council of Chalcedon, 
the Church and the Empire together sought to 
remedy these disorders by requiring episcopal 
sanction for every monastic foundation ; proper 
endowment, in order to make it independent 
of charity ; rigid enforcement of regulations ; 
and a novitiate of three years a provision 
which the abbots made a dead letter. 

Monasticism entered western Europe through 
the instrumentality of St. Jerome (340-418) 
and Augustine of Hippo (died 430), the latter 
of whom established a community of clergy 
who renounced their property, abounded in 
charitable work, and lived a life of discipline. 
The first monastery in Gaul was at Liguge, 
near Poitiers. Marmoutier, near Tours, soon 
followed, both due to the inspiration of the 
famous St. Martin (316-396), and the list 
grows longer as the years pass. But although 
emanating from the East and adopted by the 
West, western monasticism radically differed 
in intent and practices from eastern monasti- 
cism. The East was given to grotesque and 
eccentric forms of self-discipline ; the West was 
practical. The eastern monks lived a life 
apart, absorbed in abortive reflections or in 
listless idleness, doing no work, but deriving 
their support from pious but misdirected char- 
ity. Those in the Latin West, on the contrary, 
were earnest, sane in their thinking and action, 
alert, industrious, and self-supporting. The 
men of the West had no patience with pillar 
saints, like St. Simeon Stylites, or hermits who 
exiled themselves in swamps that the stings of 
insects might teach them to mortify the flesh, 
or prayed for days in thorn-bushes, or bent 
their bodies into torturing positions. 

In his chapters upon the fathers of western 
monasticism, Mr. Wishart is disappointing. 
The personalities of Benedict and Augustine, 
Bernard of Clairvaux, and Peter the Vener- 
able, are not made impressive. And save the 
Benedictine Order proper and the Franciscans, 
the rest of the orders get scant treatment. Two 
pages suffice for Cluny and two for the Cis- 
tercians ! With the winning personality of 
St. Francis, the narrative begins to mend. The 
best observation made regarding the founder of 
the Franciscans is, however, relegated to a note 
in the appendix, a bit worth quotation : 

" In many interesting particulars St. Francis may be 
compared with General Booth of the Salvation Army. 
In their intense religious fervor, in their insistence upon 
obedience, humility, and self-denial, in their services 



for the welfare of the poor, in their love of the ' sub- 
merged tenth,' they are alike. ... It is quite possible 
that the differences between Francis and Booth are due 
more to the altered historical environment than to any 
radical diversities in the characters of the two men." 

The last chapters are upon the fall of 
the monasteries, " The Disestablishment by 
Henry VIII.," and one upon " Causes and 
Ideals," an attempt philosophically to account 
for monasticism. The conclusion is that it is 
impossible to dogmatize, for the system was 
never wholly good nor wholly bad. The social 
and economic influence of the monks might 
here have been considered at greater length. 

It remains to make two corrections. It is 
straining the usage of a term to apply the word 
Saracen to the Arabians of the fifth century, 
before Mohammed was born (p. 53). If Mr. 
Wishart had read the letters of Sidonius Apol- 
linaris he would never have termed the Roman- 
ized Kelts of Gaul in the time of Constantine 
" rude Gauls just emerging out of barbarism " 
(p. 120). It was Benvenuto d'Imola who 
was so pained at the careless treatment pre- 
cious manuscripts received at Monte Cassino, 
and used the words put in Boccaccio's mouth 
in p. 136. 

" Monks and Monasteries " is the first pro- 
duct of the new publishing house of Albert 
Brandt, of Trenton, N. J., and is admirable 
in paper, print, and binding.

POMPEII RESTORED.* 



It is not often that readers in this country 
have the privilege of becoming familiar with 
the results of German scholarship in English 
before they are published in German. It is 
therefore a pleasant surprise to find that it is 
in English form, and from the press of the 
Macmillan Company, that the latest work from 
the pen of Professor August Mau has made its 
first appearance. " Pompeii, Its Life and Art," 
the preface tells us, is not a translation of any 
book previously issued by the German scholar, 
but an entirely new work, translated from 
the author's manuscript, and first published 
in English. The publishers are to be con- 
gratulated upon their enterprise in securing 
so important a foreign work. Not only is it 
the most important book, in point of complete- 
ness and trustworthiness, which has yet been

written upon Pompeii, but with these qualities 
it combines the rare merit, not always to be 
found in archaeological works, of being inter- 
estingly written, attractive in form, and hand- 
somely illustrated. It therefore deserves a 
cordial welcome not only from the student of 
classical archaeology, but from the general 
reader as well. 

From the scholar's point of view, there is 
no one better qualified to write authoritatively 
upon Pompeii than Professor Mau. Half of 
his life has been given to the study of the ruins 
of the Campanian city and all that they repre- 
sent in the way of illustrating Roman life and 
art. For a quarter of a century his summers 
have been regularly spent among the ruins, his 
winters in working up the material so col- 
lected. He is therefore familiar with literally 
every stone and corner of the excavated portion 
of the city ; and in addition to this familiarity 
with the city he possesses two essential qualities 
an enthusiastic devotion to his work, and a 
strictly scientific method. He has already writ- 
ten much in German and Italian upon special 
subjects and special problems in connection 
with Pompeii. The present work sums up the 
achievements of a scholar who made his repu- 
tation years ago but is now first introduced to 
English readers. 

There are few travellers who have not re- 
garded their visit to the excavations at Pom- 
peii as one of the most interesting and profit- 
able of their jaunts in Italy. Fewer still are 
able to form more than a vague impression of 
how each building, and how the city as a whole, 
looked in antiquity. Though the walls of the 
houses are standing, they are roofless, the wood- 
work has all disappeared, all the furniture 
and objects of artistic value have been car- 
ried for safe keeping to the Naples Museum, 
and the best of the wall paintings have been 
removed to the same place, leaving an un- 
sightly break in the plan of decorations. It 
requires something more than the unaided 
imagination to reconstruct each house or public 
building as it stood before the catastrophe of 
79 A. D., and the questions which one would 
ask are only half answered by the guide or the 
guide-book. The grand exception among the 
ruins is the house of the Vettii, excavated in 
1894 and 1895. Here the roof has been re- 
stored, the paintings have been left intact, the 
owner's safe stands in the atrium, the pots and 
kettles appear upon the hearth just as they 
were found, and the garden in the peristyle 
has been planted with flowers and shrubs, 



among which stand the statuary and the foun- 
tains just as they stood in antiquity. On seeing 
this house, one forms a more definite idea of 
how a Pompeian lived than he has been able to 
gather from all the other houses in Pompeii 
put together. What the excavators have done 
in the case of the house of the Vettii, Professor 
Mau has sought to do for the reader in the 
case of all the important buildings of Pompeii, 
the city itself, and its life. 

One by one each edifice is rebuilt in the 
reader's imagination in such a way that he can 
form a clear idea of how it must have looked 
inside and out. For the completeness of this 
picture every aid is furnished to the eye in the 
way of plans and restorations based upon care- 
ful measurements. The sectional drawings of 
these restorations, in particular, help to give 
the reader a better idea of the appearance in 
antiquity of many of the buildings than he 
could get from an actual visit to the ruins 
guide-book in hand. The decorations are then 
described, the mosaics, architectural ornaments, 
and paintings, the latter in some detail and 
with copious illustrations whenever they happen 
to be of artistic value or of interest in connec- 
tion with the development of Pompeian art. 
In the chapter on the house of the Vettii there 
are no fewer than ten illustrations of the paint- 
ings alone. A large portion of the book is nec- 
essarily taken up with describing the buildings 
of the city. The descriptions, however, in spite 
of the fact that many of the buildings possess 
some elements of similarity, do not grow tedi- 
ous ; the author has something new and enter- 
taining to say in the case of each, and it is no 
small praise to say that one finds the account 
of the last houses upon his list quite as inter- 
esting as the first. The enumeration of nec- 
essary details is relieved by passages such as 
the following, taken from the chapter on the 
house of the Faun, in which the reader is car-

" As one stepped across the mosaic border at the end 
of the fauces, a beautiful vista opened up before the 
eyes. From the aperture of the compluvium a diffused 
light was spread through the atrium brilliant with its rich 
coloring. At the rear the lofty entrance to the tablinum 
attracted the visitor by its stately dignity. Now the 
portieres are drawn aside, and beyond the large window 
of the tablinum the columns of the first peristyle are 
seen. The shrubs and flowers of the garden are rich 
with sunshine, and fragrant odors are wafted through 
the house; in the midst a slender fountain jet rises in 
the air and falls with a murmur pleasant to the ear."

Throughout the book, Professor Mau has 
endeavored to reconstruct, not merely the 
buildings of the city, but also the life of the 
people which thronged in and about them. A 
description of Isis, her worship and her wor- 
shippers, forms an integral part of the chapter 
on the temple of that goddess. The public 
buildings, the baths, the palaestra, the theatres 
and amphitheatre, are made the centre of 
a vivid account of the serious business and 
the recreations and amusements of the Pom- 
peians. In the chapters on the shops, the inns, 
the manufactories, and the farm buildings at 
Boscoreale, he describes the various trades and 
industrial processes concerned. He has thus 
given us in a single volume not only by far the 
best work upon the buildings of Pompeii, and 
the best guide-book of the city for those who 
have more than a few hours to spend there, but 
also the best account which we have of the 
details of every-day life in a Roman provincial 
town. 

The volume is a model of clear exposition. 
From beginning to end the author has taken 
the utmost pains to make it intelligible at every 
point with the least expenditure of effort on 
the part of the reader. Every term of a tech- 
nical nature is carefully explained ; the account 
of the different architectural periods and the 
styles of house decoration is beautifully clear 
and definite. Although each chapter contains a 
great deal of scholarly information, this is em- 
bodied easily in the text without detracting from 
its clearness or making it heavy. It is indeed a 
pleasure to review a book to which so much de- 
served praise can be given. Professor Mau has 
made the Pompeii of fact not less interesting to 
the general reader than the Pompeii of fiction, 
and that too without sacrificing any of those 
qualities which render such a work valuable to 
the special student, who will find it the most 
complete account of Pompeii which has yet 
been published, and one which is scholarly in 
every respect. 

The author is fortunate in having secured 
as his translator a scholar who is himself so 
familiar with Pompeii as Professor Francis W. 
Kelsey of the University of Michigan.

STORIES OF THE THOMPSON RIVER 
INDIANS.* 



The Salish Indians live in Washington, 
Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia. The 
group is linguistic, and is subdivided into two 
lesser divisions the Coast Salish and the 
Interior Salish. The languages of the Coast 
Salish are notably divergent ; those of the 
Interior Salish are more uniform. The Indians 
whose traditions are studied in the volume 
before us are Interior Salish, living along the 
upper part of the Thompson River and in the 
Nicola Valley. 

In the Introduction, Dr. Boas sketches the 
ethnography of these Indians. " They are pri- 
marily hunters and fishermen." Their villages 
are small. Until recently, the little popula- 
tions moved with the seasons, which brought 
a varying food-supply. Their social organiza- 
tion was ill-defined. There were no definite 
chiefs, no clans, no totems, no restrictions upon 
marriage except that near relations might not 
marry. The religious ideas were simple, and 
great rituals and secret societies did not exist 
among them. The sun seems to have been the 
chief object of worship. In all these points 
of ethnography, the Thompson River Indians 
differ remarkably from their neighbors 
Kwakiutl, Tshimpshian, and other coast tribes 
north of these. 

Fully half of Mr. Teit's collection of the 
traditions of these Indians are "transformer 
stories." A " transformer " is a being who has 
brought about present conditions by the trans- 
formation of those previously existing. Such 
transformers are frequent in Indian traditions, 
but usually one transformer is sufficient for a 
tribal cycle. Here, however, there are several 
such beings the Coyote, three brothers called 
Qoaq Lqah, Kokwela, and the Old Man. The 
transformer Qoaq Lqah is also a culture-hero. 
Frequently in Indian legends the culture-hero 
is at once good and bad ; he is benevolent and 
helpful ; he is a trickster and a liar. This 
peculiar combination of qualities has given rise 
to considerable discussion among ethnographers. 
To reconcile these contradictory traits in one 
being was the problem. Dr. Boas believes that 
the transformer is rarely an intentional bene- 
factor. He presents a series of illustrations of 
his operations in the stories of different tribes.

The transformer is in all purely egoistic : he 
seeks his own selfish ends ; if the results are 
helpful to mankind, this is incidental, not pur- 
posive. While this is clearly true of the tribes 
discussed, Dr. Boas shows the existence of a 
transition to stories where the altruistic efforts 
of a true culture hero become evident. 

From the presence of four transformers 
instead of one, Dr. Boas infers a probably com- 
plex origin of the Thompson River traditions. 
By an analysis of the Coyote stories, he demon- 
strates that there has been transmission of tales 
from foreign sources. The elements from these 
different sources have not yet amalgamated. 
The various transformers are beings from dif- 
ferent neighboring tribes not yet fused into 
one great culture-hero. These stories have been 
influenced by the physical environment and by 
the social organization of the Indians among 
whom they have been gathered. These influ- 
ences are considered in detail by Dr. Boas, and 
important generalizations are drawn from the 
consideration. 

Following Dr. Boas' Introduction, thirty- 
eight stories of the Thompson Eiver Indians are 
presented. To these are added two stories of the 
Lillooet. In the notes a variety of helpful mat- 
ter is given. Some of this is explanatory ; much 
is comparison with stories from elsewhere; 
some is presentation of variants ; some is the 
rendering into Latin of passages considered 
indecent. A few of the stories are given in the 
original language, with interlinear translations. 
In the comparisons instituted a wide range of 
tribes is included tribes of the whole North- 
west Coast region, Chinook, Northern Atha- 
paskan, Ponca, and Navajo. It is strange that 
with so wide a range of comparison no refer- 
ence is made to the Tehua stories given by Mr. 
Lummis. Several elements in these strikingly 
resemble those found in the Thompson River 
tales, and well deserve consideration. The 
visits by the coyote to other animals who can 
do what he cannot do ; the tree which by its 
growth carries a person up to a required point ; 
the wee basket of food that is inexhaustible, 
these are features sufficiently peculiar for their 
identical occurrence in tribes as separated as 
the Thompson River Indians and the Rio 
Grande Pueblos to be noted. The book ends 
with a valuable series of abstracts of the stories, 
made by Dr. Boas. This sort of analysis of 
folk-tales is the most important step prelimin- 
ary to serious study and comparison.

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE 
FRENCH BASTILLE.* 

Mr. Funck-Brentano's interesting book of 
" Legends of the Bastille " is based on recent 
examination of hitherto neglected records, and 
proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that a 
certain class of popular notions about that 
famous prison are not well founded. That the 
Bastille of the eighteenth century was not half 
so black as it was painted, may be taken as 
proved. What people used to call the " hor- 
rors " of the Bastille have been overdrawn. It 
may be questioned if during the last half- 
century of the prison's existence there were 
any " horrors " in the usual sense of the term. 
There were, for instance, no frightful subterra- 
nean dungeons, dank, dark, and swarming with 
vermin with toads, lizards, enormous rats, 
spiders, etc. where the starving captives lay on 
straw rattling their chains and uttering doleful 
cries. In point of fact, the Bastille of the eight- 
eenth century was a very good and humanely, 
even indulgently, conducted prison, as prisons 
then were, where the inmates appear to have 
been well fed and decently lodged. The one 
damning thing about the Bastille was that one 
might be sent there arbitrarily, at the instance 
of private malice, vengeance, or self-interest, 
and kept there as long as the powers that ruled 
thought fit. That feature of the Bastille was, 
to our thinking, "horror" enough, and a suffi- 
cient justification of democratic celebrations of 
the work that was done on July 14, 1789. 

The fact is that the motive that made men 
of liberal opinions the world over acclaim the 
fall of the Bastille was not so much humani- 
tarian as political. It is ridiculous to suppose 
that they rejoiced over that event as over a 
mere jail-delivery of a parcel of ill-treated pris- 
oners. Had there been no prisoners at all 
(and there were only a handful of them), the 
enthusiasm would have been the same. The 
Bastille was regarded as a symbol, as a tangible 
emblem, of the social and political system that 
the Revolution came to destroy. Its fall was 
hailed by Democracy as a token of the fall of 
the regime it stood for. It seems to us a very 
superficial view to hold that the significance, 
the immortal memory, of the event of July 14 
evaporates when it is proved by Dryasdust that 
when this prisoner wanted " a dressing-gown

of red-striped calamanco," he got it ; when 
that prisoner wanted " embroidered ruffles " to 
his shirt, they were procured for him ; when 
the other prisoner wanted " a dress of white 
silk spotted with green flowers," it was not 
denied her ; that there were firewood, light, 
pens, ink, paper, soap ad libitum, and so on, 
at the Bastille ; that the food there was com- 
paratively good and plenty ; and that one pris- 
oner had his flute, and another his fiddle, etc. 
All this is interesting to know, and testifies to 
the spirit of humanity that was already abroad 
in France. " Sensibility " was the humor of 
the day, of Rousseau's day, and inmates of all 
houses of detention had their share of the ben- 
efit of it. But such facts do not abate one jot 
the significance of the essential fact that the 
Bastille symbolized the arbitrary power of a 
ruling caste. The first blast of the gathering 
storm of the Revolution swept it away. 

While, to our thinking, Mr. Funck-Brentano's 
attempt to paint the Bastille as a sort of state 
hotel where the guests were clothed in purple 
and fine linen and fared sumptuously every 
day, is, in its way, as much of an exaggeration 
as the grewsome old " legends " he assails were 
in theirs, there is no denying the interest, 
authenticity, and pertinence of the facts he 
adduces in evidence. His inductions, however, 
seem to us too sweeping. He certainly makes 
havoc of the " legend " of Latude ; and his 
attempt to strip off the covering from the face 
of the Man in the Iron Mask (which was really 
a velvet mask, by-the-way) is ingenious and 
plausible, if not quite convincing. The book 
is readable and must not be neglected by stu- 
dents of the subject. Mr. George Maidment 
is the authorized translator, and M. Victorien 
Sardou has supplied a lively Introduction.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

When, as in the case of Charlemagne, 
two Nations. tne nero ^ a nation has become the 

theme of epic legends, the task of a 
biographer becomes one of de-heroizing his hero, 
and the result is apt to be disappointing in measure 
as the work is faithfully done. Something of this 
effect must be felt by the reader of Mr. Davis's 
volume on Charlemagne in the "Heroes of the 
Nations " series (Putnam), though the picture loses 
vividness as a result of its extent. A biography 
which is to treat its subject as a hero should natu- 
rally be quite personal. But when all of the 
personal details of the life of the great Emperor 
which are not strictly authentic are rejected, there 



remains scarcely enough material for a book of 
330 pages. Barring this discrepancy between the 
author's method and the title of his book, it is a 
valuable work. The summary of conditions pre- 
vious to the accession of Charlemagne to the throne 
brings together much material necessary to a proper 
background. Only here and there a generalization 
seems to be too sweeping or the trust reposed in a 
chronicler too confiding. When credit is given to 
England (page 9) for the evangelization of Ger- 
many, it would have been more exact to say Great 
Britain, since many of the first missionaries to Ger- 
many were Scotch and Irish. " The ideal Teuton 
of imaginative historians " is doubtless to be dis- 
counted, but one must be cautious in attempting to 
correct this ideal by the descriptions of a clerical 
annalist like Gregory of Tours. This, indeed, our 
author admits ; yet he quotes the descriptions of 
Gregory, while ignoring those of the " imaginative 
historians." Sympathetic imagination is the desir- 
able quality which Mr. Davis lacks in his treatment 
of his subject. It may have been wise to sift the 
sources scrupulously, but the sieve should not be so 
plainly in evidence if we are to have a hero left in 
the results (cf. page 26). The danger of too sweep- 
ing generalization is manifest in the contradictions 
of pages 90 and 319 : " The Pope's position in the 
Prankish realm is still that of a favored subordin- 
ate." " Charles belonged in fact to no nation of 
modern growth, but to the only nation which in 
his day deserved the name, to that nation in which 
local and racial differences were suppressed or trans- 
cended, to the nation of the Catholic Church. As 
the servant of the Church he humbled the Saxon, 
treated with the Dane, and cowed the Slav ; as the 
servant of the Church he led his armies first across 
the Alps and then across the Pyrenees." Similarly, 
on pages 32 and 46 : " The conceptions of the fam- 
ily, the state, civic rights and duties, were the same 
throughout the realm." " The Neustrian Frank, 
especially when of royal rank, was frequently polyg- 
amous ; irregular unions unsanctioned by the Church 
were at all times lightly contracted and lightly 
broken. But these were a departure from the best 
traditions of the race." Nevertheless, the book is 
well worth reading, especially for those who have 
not access to the sources. It is adorned with a 
number of reproductions illustrating the civilization 
of the Carolingian period.

so completely as to leave hardly a trace of its ex- 
istence. The same question is asked with regard 
to the missing portions of the Coliseum, of the Ba- 
silica of Constantine, and of many other buildings 
whose ruins still seem capable of withstanding the 
mere forces of nature for all time. This is the 
problem which Professor Lanciani undertakes to 
solve in his latest work, " The Destruction of An- 
cient Rome" (Macmillan). The book is a sketch 
of the various factors that have contributed to the 
demolition of the monuments of the ancient city, 
from antiquity down to modern times. The gen- 
eral conclusions which the author draws are not 
entirely new, but have been hinted at in his works 
already published. These conclusions are, in sub- 
stance, that the ravages of time and the invasions 
of the barbarians have played a much less important 
part in the destruction of the monuments than has 
generally been supposed, and that the chief de- 
stroyers of Ancient Rome were the Romans them- 
selves, who throughout the Middle Ages, and down 
to even comparatively recent times, not only preyed 
upon the monuments as quarries for the procuring 
of building materials, but burned many of these 
precious marbles to make lime. In the present 
work Professor Lanciani has gone into the subject 
more exhaustively, and treats it systematically and 
in chronological order. Beginning with the reign 
of Augustus, he tells, century by century, the story 
of the destruction of the ancient monuments, whether 
due to fire, flood, the sacking of the city by hostile 
armies, or the vandalism of the Romans themselves, 
and also of the extent to which the ancient buildings 
suffered from each of these causes. The book is 
thoroughly entertaining, and is interesting not 
merely from the point of view of the problem which 
the author has undertaken to solve, but also by 
reason of the vast amount of varied information, 
archaeological and historical, which it gives by the 
way. The student of history in particular will find 
some interesting sidelights thrown upon the inva- 
sions of the Northern races by the evidence of the 
excavations. The volume is profusely illustrated, 
and is rendered valuable as a book of reference by a 
good index compiled by Professor Walter Dennison 
of Oberlin College. 

The rapid exploitation of Africa in 
recent years, and the increased 
knowledge of that continent which 
has come to us, have served to bring to public notice 
an impending conflict between two great religions. 
Mohammedanism has lately spread with such start- 
ling rapidity that to-day it is the dominating reli- 
gious force in Africa north of the Equator. What 
is the duty of Christian nations in relation to this 
condition in Africa? Is Islamism suited in itself 
and in its rules of life to the best and quickest up- 
lifting of the native races ? Is it advisable to encour- 
age the native acceptance of Mohammedanism in 
order to use that religion as a stepping-stone in the 
progress from fetish worship to Christianity ? These

are the questions which the Rev. Ansen P. Atter- 
bury attempts to answer in his book on " Islam in 
Africa" (Putnam). Though the author seems not 
to have had any personal experience in Africa, he 
has apparently studied his subject with extreme 
care, and has produced a scholarly monograph, 
eminently fair and generously appreciative of the 
best features of Mohammedan faith and life. In 
his conclusion Mr. Atterbury emphatically favors 
Christianity under all circumstances and conditions, 
and is unalterably opposed to any toleration of 
Islamism, even when the latter religion serves as a 
merely temporary agency for good. It is in this 
sweeping judgment that there seems cause for criti- 
cism. Mr. Atterbury does not sufficiently distin- 
guish between the people of northern Africa, for 
centuries followers of the Mohammedan faith, and 
those of central and equatorial Africa, for the most 
part converts of the present generation and largely 
converts by compulsion. Nor is due importance 
given to differences of race in these regions. The 
consensus of recent English opinion, including that 
of many missionaries, is that while energetic action 
will save central Africa to Christianity, the day is 
far distant when Christian missionary enterprise 
will be generally successful in northern Africa. The 
book is particularly valuable in its clear and concise 
estimate of the value of Mohammedanism as a civil- 
izing agency for the negro races. It should be of 
great interest to all observers of African affairs. 

A recent volume of " Great Masters 
5n . Dinting and Sculpture" (Mac- 
inillan) is given to Luca Signorelli, 
by Miss Maud Cruttwell. We pointed out, some 
months ago, the particular interest attaching to 
the first volumes of this series those on Luini 
and Velasquez. We will confess that we see no 
especial reason for continuing the series with Luca 
Signorelli : it would seem proper to include him, 
doubtless, but his appearance so early reminds one 
of the man who sought too high a seat at the wed- 
ding feast. It is true that it is not really a matter 
of importance just where in such a series any given 
painter may appear ; still, the fact that the volume 
on Signorelli comes just where it does brings up 
more strongly than would otherwise be the case the 
contrast between him and the masters who have 
been mentioned. Signorelli is not intrinsically as 
great a man as Velasquez, nor is he representative 
of so much as Luini. What is he? Why does he 
continue to exist? Why have a book about him 
with forty pictures? The average student of the 
arts, if taken very suddenly with these questions, 
will say that Signorelli is interesting as a prede- 
cessor of Michael Angelo. But we must expect of 
a biographer something more definite than this, and 
something less academic. No one but a student or 
a professor will bother about a predecessor when he 
can have the man himself. We rather think that 
the author of this book goes far toward making out 
a case, does much in giving Signorelli an independ-

amateur, we do not think that spirit will ever again

In " The Theology of Modern Lit-

of ten different authors, namely, Emerson, Carlyle, 
Browning, George Eliot, George MacDonald, J. M. 
Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Thomas 
Hardy, and George Meredith. Among the 450 
pages of this volume there are many interesting 
ones ; the author's analysis and discussion show 
considerable insight and literary appreciation, but 
the critical value of the volume is much impaired 
by the persistent intrusion of the author's own dog- 
matic theology, which is of the most pronounced 
antiquarian type. In his opinion, " there are few 
phases of our literature which can be considered 
deeply or pronouncedly religious. . . . The theol- 
ogy which the circulating library now uses its vast 
network of agencies to circulate is very largely a 
theology which empties Scriptures of their meaning, 
substitutes uninspired materials for inspired in the 
evolution of belief, sets up a defiant individualism 
against the historic consciousness of Christendom, 
resolves the grace of God into a 'sweet reasonable- 
ness,' and insists that Christianity shall commit sui- 
cide by renouncing everything Christian." To 
rescue theology from becoming " the vassal or the 
troll of literature ... to bring the theology of the 
litterateur and the belle-lettrist into comparison 
with the theology of Church and Creed, and where 
the two are not en rapport, as very often happens, 
to indicate as accurately as possible the precise 
angle of divergence," is the author's self-appointed 
task. There is more than a touch of medievalism 
in " criticism " of this sort.

Professor Hugh Robert Mill's " In-

It has seventy different contributors, chosen from 
among the foremost specialists in the world in their 
several branches of knowledge, and with particular 
reference to their acquaintance with the specific 
subjects they were to treat. For example, Professor 
W. M. Davis, of Harvard University, writes the

the United States, the last one being the longest in 
the book. Part I. of the work deals with the 
" Principles of Geography "under the heads, " Geog- 
raphy, Principles and Progress," "Mathematical

Plan of the Earth," " Land Forms, their Nature 
and Origin," " The Oceans," " Atmosphere and

"The Distribution of Mankind," "Political and

Polar Regions. The work will be of value even to 
advanced students of geography who desire to have 
the more important knowledge of the world brought 
together in one book ; but it will be found even 
more helpful by a far larger class of persons 
students of other sciences, historians and students of 
history, journalists, men in public life, men of let- 
ters and students of literature, and general readers 
who are frequently in sore need of some manual to 
which they can readily turn for information that is 
relatively full and perfectly authoritative. The 
illustrations, nearly five hundred in number, a ma- 
jority of them sketch-maps, add much to the value 
of the work. - 

" The Temple Primers," published 
by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. in con- 
nection with the Messrs. Macmillan, 
are designed to provide, "in a convenient and acces- 
sible form, the information which the usual bulky 
and high-priced encyclopaedias place beyond the easy 
reach of the average reader." Judging by the 
promises of the publishers, this series of small books 
is likely to run into the hundreds of volumes, for 
nothing less than " a complete and trustworthy 
Primer-Cyclopaedia of modern knowledge " is what 
we are told to expect. The writers will be the fore- 
most English, French, German, and Italian special- 
ists, and such works are promised as " Modern 
Chemistry," by Professor Ramsay ; " Mediaeval 
French Literature," by M. Gaston Paris ; " Educa- 
tional Methods," by Dr. Rein ; and " The Italian 
Renaissance," by Prof essor Villari. The volumes, 
which will be illustrated when found desirable, are 
exceedingly attractive in form, and are sold at a 
low price. The following eight numbers have been 
received by us : " An Introduction to Science," by 
Dr. Alexander Hill ; " A History of Politics," by 
Professor E. Jenks ; " The English Church," by Dean 
Spence ; " Roman History," by Dr. Julius Koch ; 
" Dante," by Mr. E. G. Gardner ; " The Civilization 
of India," by Mr. Romesh C. Dutt ; " The Greek 
Drama," by Mr. L. D. Barnett ; and " Ethnology," 
by Dr. Michael Haberlandt. We wish the projectors 
of this enterprise every success, for its usefulness is 
fully attested by the volumes now published, and it 
is likely to do a great work for the popularization 
of the latest results of scholarship. 

A considerable amount of curious 
information of a sort not altogether 
justly thought to lie outside the prov- 
ince of history is to be found in Mr. Tighe Hopkins's 
"An Idler in Old France" (Scribner). Clio is 
commonly too busy with the doings of courts and 
cabinets, diplomats and soldiers, to pay much atten- 
tion to the vulgar facts of life to tell us how men 
and women ate, drank, dressed, and amused them- 
selves, what were their notions in respect of the 
toilet and the bath, etc. It is of such and kindred

Miss Rosalind Pritchard. 

Since Messrs. Maynard, Merrill & Co. abandoned 
their American edition of Ruskin, with the special pre- 
faces contributed by Mr. Charles Eliot Norton, the work 
of introducing the volumes still published from time to 
time by Mr. George Allen has fallen to other American 
houses. The latest of these volumes, now imported by 
the Messrs. Scribner, is a new edition of " Giotto and His 
Works in Padua." The first edition of this book dates 
from 1854, and was due to the enterprise of the Arundel 
Society, which issued a series of reproductions of the 
frescoes in the Arena Chapel, and obtained the services 
of Mr. Ruskin for the explanatory text by which they 
were accompanied. The present edition contains some 
new matter in the form of notes, besides a number of ad- 
ditional plates. The plates are now upward of fifty in 
number, and are fairly well reproduced. The volume 
is a beautiful one, and an important addition to the col- 
lected series of new editions of Mr. Ruskin's work. 

Heer Martinus Nijhoff, the veteran bookseller of the 
Hague, has compiled a catalogue of the principal works 
that concern the history of the Netherlands, the whole 
forming " the real nucleus of Dutch historical litera- 
ture." The books here described are kept in stock 
in complete sets, and offered for sale at one thou- 
sand dollars to such libraries as may wish to " indulge 
into the expenses of securing a ready-made collection 
of the best works on the history of the Netherlands." 
The list includes 183 numbers, many of them being 
sets of many volumes each, such as the publications, in 
180 volumes, of the Historisch Genootschap. 

A second edition, revised and enlarged, of " The 
Grammar of Science," by Professor Karl Pearson, has 
just been published in a single stout volume by the 
Macmillan Co. This critical investigation of the funda- 
mental concepts of science belongs to the general class 
of books which includes the writings of W. K. Clifford, 
W. S. Jevons, the late Judge Stallo, and Professor Pierce, 
and it is one of the most thought-provoking of them all. 



NOTES. 



" William Gillette in Sherlock Holmes " is the title 
of an illustrated souvenir pamphlet published by Mr. 
R. H. Russell. 

" The American Salad Book," by Mr. Maximilian de 
Loup, is a practical and timely new publication of 
Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co. 

A volume on " Bach," by Mr. C. F. Abdy Williams,

" Master Musicians " series, edited by Mr. F. J. 
Crowest. 

" American Inventions and Inventors," by Messrs. 
W. A. Mowry and A. W. Mowry, is an illustrated read- 
ing-book for schools, just published by Messrs. Silver, 
Burdett, & Co. 

" Lee's American Automobile Annual for 1900," pub- 
lished by Messrs. Laird & Lee, is a volume whose title 
is self-explanatory. Dr. Alfred B. Chambers has edited 
the publication. 

Mr. Arthur L. Goodrich has prepared, and the Mac- 
millan Co. have published, a volume of " Topics on 
Greek and Roman History," which teachers in high 
schools will find useful in their work. 

Volumes IX. and X. of the " Larger Temple Shake- 
speare" (Macmillan) have just appeared, and carry 
that admirable edition well along toward completion. 
Two more volumes remain to be published. 

A " First Book of Home Geography and the Earth 
as a Whole," published by the Macmillan Co., is the 
joint work of Professors Ralph S. Tarr and F. M. Mc- 
Murry. It is provided with many illustrations and 
colored maps. 

Mrs. May Alden Ward is the author of " Prophets 
of the Nineteenth Century," a small volume published 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. It consists of three 
chapters, devoted respectively to Carlyle, Ruskin, and 
Count Tolstoy. 

A fifth and revised edition of Mr. Richard Le Gal- 
lienne's critical study of Mr. George Meredith has just 
been published by Mr. John Lane. The work is made 
particularly valuable by the addition of a portrait and 
the inclusion of a bibliography. 

" The Mother Tongue " is a work in two volumes, 
prepared by Professor G. L. Kittredge and Miss Sarah 
Louise Arnold, and published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
It is a text-book in elementary English, designed for 
primary and grammar school children. 

Professor Edward Channing has made " A Short His- 
tory of the United States for School Use " which is one 
of the best books of its class, having most of the admir- 
able characteristics of the author's large work upon the 
same subject. The Macmillan Co. publish the volume. 

The American Book Co. publish Scott's " Quentin 
Durward " in a school edition prepared by Miss Mary 
Harriott Norris. From the same publishers we have 
also a volume of "Old Norse Stories," retold for child- 
ren by Miss Sarah Powers Bradish, and attractively 
illustrated. 

The extensive collection of papers and publications 
relating to the World's Congresses at Chicago in 1893, 
made by Mr. C. C. Bonney, President of the Congresses, 
will hereafter be in the keeping of the Chicago Public 
Library, where a suitable cabinet has been provided for 
its permanent safekeeping, and where it will be acces- 
sible to the public for reference. It is to be hoped that

the library authorities, in recognition of Mr. Bonney's 
distinguished services and generous donation, will pro- 
vide a special catalogue of this unique and invaluable 
collection of what is the most vital and enduring part 
of the Columbian Exposition, and that the collection will 
permanently bear his name. 

The forty-third volume of " L'Anne"e Scientifique et 
Industrielle," a publication founded by Louis Figuier, 
has just been published by Messrs. Hachette & Co. 
The volume covers the year 1899, and has been pre- 
pared by M. Emile Gautier. Under the head of " Tra- 
vaux Publics," the Exposition comes in for treatment 
at some length. The material of the work is classified, 
and ranges from cosmology to the death-roll of the 
year. 

The National Council of Education offers two prizes 
(of $200 and $100 respectively) for the best two 
essays upon each of the following four subjects: the 
seating, the lighting, the heating, and the ventilation of 
school buildings. The limit is ten thousand words for 
each essay, and all manuscripts must be submitted by 
February of next year. Mr. A. R. Taylor, of Emporia, 
Kansas, is chairman of the committee in charge, and 
will furnish particulars of the competition to those 
interested. 

" Orators of Ancient Rome " and " Orators of the 
Reformation Era," both edited by Messrs. Guy Carleton 
Lee and Joseph Cullen Ayer, form the second and 
fourth volumes of " The World's Orators," to be pub- 
lished in ten volumes by the Messrs. Putnam. These 
handsome tomes, with their portraits and their dignified 
typographical dress, deserve a place in every library, 
and we predict that the thousand sets to which this 
" University Edition " is limited will be speedily taken 
up by subscribers. 

" The International Monthly " offers a series of prizes, 
called "Teachers' Fellowships," of $150 each, for essays 
embodying some amount of original research in the 
following departments: history, philosophy, sociology, 
comparative religion, literature, fine art, biology, geol- 
ogy, economics, and education. One or more prizes 
will be awarded in each department. The competition 
is open to all persons actively engaged in the profession 
of teaching. For conditions and further particulars 
application should be made to the Fellowship Editor, 
Burlington, Vermont. 

The resignation of Dr. Henry Wade Rogers from 
the presidency of the Northwestern University is an 
event to be deplored in any case, and if, as the public 
prints hint somewhat broadly, the resignation was 
forced, and connected in any way with the manly and 
outspoken attitude of Dr. Rogers toward the present 
attempt of certain politicians, temporarily in power, to 
subvert the foundations of the American Republic, it is 
an event of sinister significance to educational interests 
in general. If the authorities of the University do not 
make it clear that this motive had nothing to do with 
the retirement of Dr. Rogers, they will suffer severely 
in the opinion of the intelligent public, and the prestige 
of their institution will have been dealt a blow from 
which recovery will not soon or easily be made. To 
Dr. Rogers, upon his departure from the scene of his 
recent activities, THE DIAL wishes to pay a tribute of 
respect and admiration for the efficient work that he 
has done to promote the best interests of the higher 
education, and for his devotion to ideals that are now 
being roughly attacked in many quarters.

THE BATH COMEDY 

A NOVEL 

By AGNES and EGERTON CASTLE, Authors of "The Pride of Jennico," etc. 

The scene of the story is the fashionable resort of the Spa of Bath, and the time, the second half of the 
eighteenth century. Mistress Kitty Bellairs, widow, reigning belle and prettiest woman in Bath, finds her friend, 
Lady Standish, the newly wedded wife of Sir Jasper, in tears, because of her husband's indifference and neglect. 
" Make him jealous," says the vivacious Kitty, and Lady Standish does so with some exciting and unexpected 
results. These are told by the authors in a style so witty and polished that they recall to the mind of the reader 
the greatest masterpiece in this field. 

Mr. Castle has written an interesting preface to " The Bath Comedy," in which he touches on some of the 
striking characteristics of the story, and has something to say " about the aspects and history of the quaint grey- 
stoned city of palatial squares and crescents nestling at the bottom of the valley of the tortuous Avon." 

Extraordinary care has been taken in the typography and other details of the manufacture of "The 
Bath Comedy." The cover used on the book was indicated by Mr. Castle himself, who wished the dress 
of his book to be in keeping with the 18th Century elegance of Bath in its palmy days. 

Size, 4%x7'/o inches, cloth, 315 pages, $1.50. 



AN OPERA 
AND LADY QRASMERE 

By ALBERT KINROSS 

A charming love story, fresh and unhackneyed. The hero 
is a young composer who has been working incessantly for 
three years on an opera. A friend visiting London persuades 
him to spend the evening with him, and on their way home, 
in a spirit of bravado, they go uninvited to a masked ball at 
a fashionable house, where Lady Grasmere comes upon the 
scene. This glimpse of fashionable life stirs the young musi- 
cian, and from that time on he determines to give up his work, 
drop the opera, and become a man of fashion. Of this life, 
and of his relations with Lady Grasmere, the story treats. 

Mr. Kinross's style is bright and witty, and there is an 
originality about the story that makes it fascinating reading. 

"Piquant, lively, exciting, altogether charming." Brad- 
ford (England) Observer. 

" A brilliantly written book, coruscating with wit and be- 
gemmed with epigram.'" Western Mercury (Plymouth, 



Size, 4%x7% inches, cloth, $1.25.

FOUR YEARS, NINE 

By BART MYNDERSE 

A most original and powerful work. A series of stories of 
prison life, which are incomparable for their wit, strength, and 
occasional pathos. They are a perfect picture of life behind 
the bars. Nothing more striking or fresh could be conceived. 
The most prominent note in these stories is their humor, but 
there is a pathetic touch occasionally that is very effective. 
12mo, cloth, with appropriate cover, $1.50. 

FROM DOOR TO DOOR 

By BERNARD CAPES 

A strong series of short stories by the author of "Our 
Lady of Darkness." Several of the stories are printed here 
for the first time, although many have appeared in the lead- 
ing periodicals. Mr. Capes has divided them into four classes, 
which he designates as " Fantasies," " Romances," " Whim- 
sies," and " Levities." As this classification would indicate, 
there is a variety about the stories that adds materially to the 
charm of the book. 

Size, 4%x7 1 / inches, cloth, gilt top, $1.50.

fields, and roads.

A MASTER OF CRAFT 

By W. W. JACOBS 

A new novel by this delightful humorist. The hero, Cap- 
tain Flower, is the captain of a coasting vessel of the kind 
made famous by Mr. Jacobs in " Many Cargoes " and " More 
Cargoes." The Captain confesses to having a great fascination 
for women, and when the story opens he is engaged to three 
of them, and in one case under an assumed name. 

Size, 4%x7% inches, cloth, $1.50. 

TOWARDS PRETORIA 

By JULIAN RALPH 

The famous American Correspondent of The London Daily 
Mail. A Record of the War between the Briton and Boer to 
the Relief of Kimberley. With a summary of subsequent 
events to the Hoisting of the British flag at Bloemfoutein. 
With historical Foreword, Appendices, and Map. 

" It is no part of our business to arrange the war correspond- 
ents in order of merit, but if it were we should certainly consider 
the question of placing Mr. Julian Ralph, who writes ' Towards 
Pretoria,' at the top of the list. He writes better than do the 
war correspondents of an older generation, and succeeds in 
giving the impression of a real man describing a real thing that 
he has seen, instead of that of an ungrammatical rhetorician 
piling up the agony. 

" Of the operation of Lord Methuen's column which he ac- 
companied, there has appeared no more vivid and acceptable 
account than his. . . . Mr. Ralph's is distinctly one of the 
war books to be read." Literature (London).

Personal Recollections. 

By H. SUTHERLAND EDWARDS. 288 pages; 

size, 5x7.1 inches; cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 

Mr. Sutherland Edwards has been an Editor, Play- 
wright, " War Special " and Foreign Correspondent, and 
his various vocations have naturally brought him into 
contact with many notable and interesting persons. Of 
these he tells numerous delightful stories. In addition, 
Mr. Edwards is one of the most experienced and re- 
nowned of English writers upon music, and his work has 
many entertaining pages devoted to noted musicians. The 
volume is as varied in matter as it is vivacious in manner. 
No " diner out " can afford to be without this book. 

NEW EDITION, THOROUGHLY REVISED TO DATE. 

The Story of the Heavens. 

By SIR ROBERT STAWELL BALL, LL.D., D.Sc., 
Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry in 
the University of Cambridge. With 24 Colored 
Plates and numerous Illustrations; nearly 600 pages, 
size, 6 x 9J ; cloth, $3.50. 
"A wondrous story leading us to contemplate the grand 

phenomena in nature and the great achievements of human 

genius. An entertaining story in simple language of the

most eminent living painters of landscapes. The book 
he has prepared is an exposition of his methods of study

A NEW BOOK OP AFRICAN TRAVEL. 

A White Woman in Central Africa. 

A Record of a Journey Taken Alone by a Lady 

Across Africa. 

By HELEN CADDICK. 16 illustrations; cloth, 81.25. 
"There is undeniable fascination in the pages of this 
serenely complacent record of a pleasure trip. ... It is her 
independent manner of accomplishing this expedition that 
imparts a special charm and novelty to her narrative." 

The Coming of the Kilogram ; 

Or, The Battle of the Standards. 
By H. O. ARNOLD-FORSTER, M.P. Illustrated; 

166 pages; size, 5 x 7.1 ; cloth, $1.00. 

This book is not intended as a manual of instruction 
in the use of the metric weights and measures. It is a 
simple and complete explanation of the Metric System, 
the object and aim being to make Americans and En- 
glishmen realize the position in which they stand in the 
competition of the civilized world, and to show them 
exactly what they are risking by clinging to their present 
system of weights and measures. 



Royal Academy Pictures, 1900. 

NOW BEADY. 
Published in Five Parts, 40 cents each; also one volume, 

cloth, gilt edges, $3.00. 

This work is an authoritative, comprehensive, and 
worthy record of the Royal Academy, and this year's 
issue will fully sustain its reputation. 

Intending purchasers would do well to order the 
whole of the Five Parts at the same time, as they 
quickly run out of print. 

"It is really a beautiful work of art. The scale upon 
which the pictures are produced, and the manner in which 
they are brought out on fine-art paper, give a vivid idea of 
the originals." Morning. 

"It is not too much to say that the highest artistic 
results have been attained." Christian World. 

With Dante in Paradise. 

Readings from the "Paradise." 
By ROSE E. SELFE, author of How Dante Climbed 

the Mountain." With 6 full-page Illustrations, 75c. 

In this work the author attempts to present in a sim- 
ple form some of the many lessons contained in Dante's 
" Paradise," as this third and, in the opinion of most 
Dante students and scholars, greatest Cantica of the 
Divine Comedy is much less generally known than the 
two other parts. In view of the fact that this author's 
previous work, " How Dante Climbed the Mountain," 
has passed through five editions, this book should find 
a wide circle of readers. 

Cassell's Guide to Paris. 

With numerous Illustrations and Map; about 200 pages; 

cloth, 50 cents; paper, 25 cents. 

An entirely new and original work prepared expressly 
for the use of tourists to the Paris Exposition. 

An outlay of fifty cents on this work is likely to save 
the tourist many dollars. The immense amount of useful, 
practical information which the Guide contains will not 
only render it a delightful and helpful companion, but 
enable its possessor to save time and money, to see the 
greatest number of sights in the most convenient man- 
ner, and to spend the time more agreeably and profit- 
ably than would otherwise be possible.
