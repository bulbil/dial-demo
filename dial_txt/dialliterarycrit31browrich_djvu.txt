A NEW WRITER FROM THE SOUTH 
JUST PUBLISHED 

A Summer Hymnal 

A Romance of Tennessee 

By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE. Illustrated by Stanley M. Arthurs. With a 

photogravure frontispiece by Clare Victor Dwiggins. l2mo, list price $1.25. 

MR. MOORE has much of the quality displayed by James Lane Allen in the earlier 
work, " A Kentucky Cardinal." The scene of his story is laid in the blue-grass region 
of Tennessee, and his pages are rich with tender sentiment, shrewd philosophy, poetic feeling, 
and an exquisite humor. Those who have read his charming and pathetic short story, " Ole 
Mistis," will welcome his first novel, and new readers are sure to be delighted. " Old Wash," 
the negro character who figures in some of Mr. Moore's short stories, reappears in this book. 
Mr. Moore has the happy faculty of expressing thought epigrammatically, as when he puts 
into the mouth of one of his characters, " A truth fits every other truth in the world, but a 
lie fits nothing but some other lie made especially for it," a saying that surely deserves to live. 



L. de V. Matthewman says, in the Philadelphia 
Evening Telegraph: 

" A story of marked originality, which will greatly 
interest those who can appreciate the quiet as opposed 
to the strenuous life. 

" Not less charming than the story is the manner 
of telling. The shrewd, homely, common sense philos* 
ophy — philosophy, not of books, but of life — is 
refreshing. 

" Those who love quiet and repose, who can feel 
the beauty and the power of Nature, who prefer the 
sunshot woodland paths to the rush of Broadway, will 
follow Mr. Moore step by step with ever-growing 
delight. The woods and fields of Tennessee he trans- 
forms into Arcady, and is the most delightful cicerone. 



It would be impossible to read a < Summer Hymnal ' 
understandably without learning and profiting much. 
Few, we think, who read the book once will be satisfied 
with one reading. Mr. Moore is to be congratulated 
on having given to the reading public a charming 
prose poem." 

The New York Journal says: 

" The story that Mr. Moore has told of a man who 
as a lad of fifteen falls in love with a girl of ten, and 
as a man fails at first to realize that he is still in love 
with her and so almost misses the happiness of bis 
life; of a blind philosopher, who also loves this girl, 
Thesis, but sacrifices that love for his younger com- 
panion, and of a Summer outdoor life that is delight- 
ful, is something that few can afford to miss reading." 



EIGHTH THOUSAND 

In Search of Mademoiselle 

By George Gibbs. Illustrated by the 
Author. 12mo, list price, $1.60. 

«' A story which, in spite of one's self, causes one's 
feeling of weariness at the thought of a historical 
romance to vanish into thin air. It is dramatic in 
the extreme and thrillingly interesting from cover to 
cover. To open the book is to become interested in 
it; to make the acquaintance of Mademoiselle is to 
awaken an eagerness to join in the search." 

— Philadelphia Telegraph. 

" * In Search of Mademoiselle,' by George Gibbs, 
is a gem. Let it be said unhesitatingly that of all 
the recent popular and wide-selling novels, colonial 
or otherwise, Mr. Gibbs's story stands way and ahead 
in the writer's humble opinion of any of them. It 
outranks 'Richard Carvel'; it dims the lustre of 
'Janice Meredith.' It is a book decidedly worth 
while, and Mr. Gibbs's exquisite style is unapproach- 
able." — New York Press.

"The story fascinates from beginning to end." 
— Current Literature (New York). 

" Quaint, delicious humor. It is a jolly, lilting

wealth of color and incident and action." 

— Philadelphia North American. 

" The story is well told in an interesting way, and 
will hold its own well in the crowd of colonial 
romance." — Philadelphia Times. 

" A bit of literature that makes exceedingly pleasant 
reading. A welcome addition, well worth buying for 
the sake of its strong story." — Baltimore Sun.

one of interest and power." — Louiwille Times.

China and the Allies 

BY A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR 

Famous as a traveller, and the author of " In the Forbidden Land." 



With 269 Illustrations. 

5 full-page Chinese prints, reproduced in 
their original colors — and illustrating 
phases of the uprising, including various 
forms of torture devised by the Chinese 
for the punishment of foreigners. 

16 full pages in tints, illustrating important 
scenes in the war. 

4-8 full pages in black and white, from pho- 
tographs and drawings by the author. 

200 text illustrations, mostlv from photo- 
graphs taken by the author, and a few 
from drawings. 



AN impartial and masterly review of the 
recent military operations in China and 
the events preceding them. Mr. Landor was 
the first European to enter the Forbidden Citv 
as a guest bv the side of the Russian General. 
Holding no official position, and bound by no 
official etiquette, he was perhaps the only eye- 
witness at libertv to report all that he saw. 



In two large octavo volumes^ each 6x9 
inches in sizCy with a total of 136 
chapters and 876 pages. $7.50 net. 

Affords a comprehensive view of the whole 
Chinese difficulty, tracing the anti- foreign 
movement to its original sources, and follow- 
ing the progress of the allies to their settlement 
in Pekin pending the diplomatic finale still in 
abeyance. 

Shows the development and the true nature 
of the Boxer movement by translations of the 
most interesting Boxer circulars and posters, 
and by the official records of the allied powers. 

Compares the allied forces in action and 
inaction in vigorous and unsparing phrase, 
presenting word -pictures whose impartiality 
and truth are self-evident. 

Throws a new and impartial light upon the 
much-vexed missionarv question, and shows 
that Chinese hatred of foreigners, contrary to 
recent statements, embraces Americans as well 
as others.

Bride," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" A clever satire, first, on platonic friendship as between 
impressionable young folk of opposite sexes, and second, 
on the literary tricksters of the day. An up-to-date atmos- 
phere is di£Eused throughout by reason of various allusions 
to very recent events. While the dialogue is somewhat too

deliciously pyrotechnical." — The Outlook.

" Will take its place, not among the ephemeral literature

A Comparison of TWO GREAT NOVELS of the Civil War 

THE CRISIS and THE GRAPES OF WRATH 



(By WINSTON CHURCHILL) 

It is carious that two novels on the same general theme, 
by different aathors, withoat collaboration, and appearing 
simultaneously, should complement each other as do these 
books. By reading both a more complete knowledge of the 
war can be obtained than from many volumes of military 
history. 

" The Grapes of Wrath " differs in almost every respect 
from the conventional Civil War novel. Miss Norris plunges 
her readers at once into the midst of the war. Her story 
opens in a New Jersey village in 1864, and the reader follows 
the fortunes and adventures which give a more diversified 
picture of life in the North and South than any other story 
of the great conflict. 

By contrast, historically, with "The Crisis," we find in 
" The Grapes of Wrath " full and vivid descriptions of the 
last year of the war in Virginia, from the opening of the 
Battle of the Wilderness to the Surrender, instead of scenes 
early in the war. In " The Grapes of Wrath " is a fine scene, 
graphically described, in which the heroine is present at a 
council of war of General Lee and his staff. In another 
dramatic scene General Lee tries to show President Davis 
the absolute necessity of evacuating Richmond before it 
becomes too late. 



(By MARY HARRIOTT NORRIS) 

" The Grapes of Wrath " has an air of reality that con- 
vinces the reader that most of it is taken from actual 
occurrences. Mr. Churchill describes fully the life of St. 
Loais just before the war and daring its first years. Miss 
Norris describes with equal vividness those pathetic, thrill- 
ing days in Richmond before the surrender, the night of 
pillage at the hands of the mob, the entry of the Union 
forces, and the last desperate battles of the dying Confed- 
eracy. There is a superb description, unforgettable in 
the impression it leaves, of the Wilderness through which 
our armies fought, inch by inch, against the intrenched 
South. 

Perhaps the most remarkable portion of " The Grapes of 
Wrath " is the long account of the Union Captain Haldane's 
captivity in the abandoned mine in the Wilderness where a 
horde of negroes who had ran away from their masters had 
gathered, and lived collecting plunder and wealth of all 
sorts in preparation for freedom. We see the faithful neg^ro, 
but we also encounter the predatory negro, sacking houses, 
robbing the dead, plundering everywhere, and holding wild 
orgies. Obviously the author did not write it to please any- 
body, bat to give a trathfol picture of both sides in all their 
phases daring the most important year of the Civil War. 



THE GRAPES OF WRATH is published by SMALL, MAYNARD & CO. Price, $L50.

Taken alone, this author's verses which appear in

quaint, ridiculous drawings of F. Opper they simply 
become comical in the highest degree — irresistible

The Macmillan Company has Just Published 

AN AMERICAN NOVEL . 

Two years ago Mr. Winston Churchill's " Richard Carvel " was 
published — the most successful novel of its kind ever issued — 

Two weeks ago to=day Mr. Churchill published his new novel — 

THE CRISIS 

THE BEST STORY THIS AUTHOR HAS YET WRITTEN 



During the past few weeks the publishers have been watching the comments of the Press with 
deep interest, and they have not yet seen a single adverse criticism. Out of the many notices 
already received, the publishers take the liberty of quoting a few 

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS: 

" Mr. Winston Churchill has gained greatly in the power of making a character live and breathe before your 
eyes, and reveal its own personality through its part in conversation and through its deeds." — Boston Herald. 

" The lore story is charmingly told. Mr. Churchill, it must be acknowledged, has scored a distinct success 
with this book. It is full of brilliant bits, clever epigrams, flashing analysis, and displays withal a broad grasp 
npon the meaning of things as they stood related to events and to history in those dark years of the nation's 
travail. It is not too much to say that it is the best novel founded on the Civil War period that has yet been 
published." — Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

<< A book that presents the great crisis in our national life with splendid power, and with a sympathy, a sin- 
cerity, and a patriotism that are inspiring. The several scenes in the book in which Abraham Lincoln figures 
must be read in their entirety, for they give a picture of that g^at, magnetic, loveable man which has been drawn 
with evident affection and exceptional success." — Chicago Tribune. 

" The reader is swept along by a relentless series of events toward the inevitable crash which shook the nation. 
Men, then obscure, whose names now will ring till the end of time, pass simply and naturally through these pages." 
— The Bookman. 

" ' The Crisis ' is a book which it is a pleasure to recommend. It promises to be one' of the popular successes, 
and, unlike a good many popular successes, it really deserves to succeed." — New York Commercial Adoertiser. 

" Above all. • The Crisis ' is a book every American shoidd know, for it teaches him anew to revere 
the memory of the men to whom, this nation owes its continued existence to bow in gratitude to even the 
least of them who struggled on the hustings and in daily life or latter shouldered a musket, thai this 
nation, under God, should have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, 
for the people, should not perish from the earth." — Nkw Yokk Mau. aitd Expbess. 



The great popularity of " Richard Carvel," 375,000 copies of this novel having been sold, 
has led the publishers to print 100,000 copies for the first edition of " The Crisis." The first 
orders will consume the entire stock. 

The book has eight charming Illustrations by HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY. 
In size and style it is uniform with " Richard Carvel," being 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50.

When the Union League Club of Chicago, 
last February, invited Mr. Frederic Harrison 
to join in its annual observance of the birthday 
of George Washington, it made a singularly 
happy choice. Mr. Harrison is not only a 
finished public speaker, but he is also a his- 
torical scholar of broad-minded view, and a 
political philosopher of the first rank. Few 
Englishmen are as free from the insular preju- 
dices that are apt to warp the opinions of the 
best-intentioned of his fellow-countrymen, and 
in his mental bearing there is no trace of " a 
certain condescension toward foreigners." He 
is, moreover, noticeable for a tendency to exalt 
the role of the great man in history, while free 
from the erratic temper of such men as Carlyle 
and Emerson, whose selection of figures for the 
illustration of this principle was sometimes 
peculiar. The wisdom which chose Mr. Harri- 
son as the panegyrist of the first great American 
was as fully justified as that which has made 
him the most prominent figure in the approach- 
ing millenary of the first great Englisbman. 

When Mr. Harrison returned to his own 
country, after remaining with us for several 
weeks, we confidently expected that he would 
have some " impressions of America " to give 
the English public, and would have felt keenly 
disappointed had he kept the impressions to 
himself. Mr. Harrison, with the possible ex- 
ception of Mr. James Bryce, has been the most 
distinguished of our English visitors since 
Matthew Arnold viewed our civilization 
through his critical lenses, and, unlike Mr. 
Arnold, he refrained from the rashness of dis- 
coursing beforehand upon what he expected 
to find in the New World. He was thus spared 
the awkwardness of correcting his a priori 
judgments, and he did not come to us as a 
critic who had already rubbed our fur the 
wrong way. There is no reason, then, why we 
should not give an open-minded greeting to his 
comments upon our society, and thank him no 
less for what he finds to blame than what he 
finds to praise. 

Fortunately for our pride, Mr. Harrison, in 
his essay just published in " The Nineteenth 
Century," finds comparatively little to blame 
in our national life as he viewed it, and when 
he does chide, it is so gently that it would need 
a very captious person to take offense. From 



10 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



the ordinary adverse prepossessions of our for- 
eign visitors he is noticeably free. He knows 
how to reckon at its true value the European 
legend of American life, knows how largely 
that legend is based upon our newspapers that 
do their best to misrepresent us, upon the snap- 
shot opinions of irritable tourists, and upon the 
eccentric conduct of some of our citizens when 
they find themselves in foreign parts. There 
is no parti pris in Mr. Harrison's estimate ; 
he came to us with candid mind, determined 
to report upon what he actually saw or dis- 
cerned to be the truth concerning us. 

Let us glance for a moment at some of his 
main conclusions. He is not misled by the 
mingling of nationalities that has produced the 
American people, but sees clearly that, with 
all the foreign strains in our population, we 
are essentially a people of English type, with 
English ideals of law, politics, and morals. 

" The citizen of the United States is at heart much 
the same man as the subject of King Edward; the 
intellectual, social, and religious tone is nearly identical; 
the proverbial differences we hear of have been absurdly 
exaggerated. . . . The American world is practically 
' run ' by genuine Americans. Foreigners are more en 
evidence in London or Manchester, it seemed to me, 
than they are in New York, Philadelphia, or Boston. 
. . . From Long Island to San Francisco, from Florida 
Bay to Vancouver's Island, there is one dominant race 
and civilization, one language, one type of law, one 
sense of nationality." 

Of Chicago, the city in which Mr. Harrison 
first sojourned, and which he takes to be more 
typical of our civilization than almost any 
other, he has many interesting things to say. 
He does not find pork, grain, and anarchists 
to be its specialties, but rather education, and 
art, and social amelioration. 

"Certainly, during my visit I heard of nothing but 
the progress of education, university endowments, 
people's institutes, libraries, museums, art schools, 
workmen's model dwellings and farms, literary culture, 
and scientific foundations. I saw there one of the best 
equipped and most vigorous art schools in America, one 
of the best Toynbee Hall settlements in the world, and 
perhaps the most rapidly developed university in exist- 
ence. My friends of the Union League Club, them- 
selves men of business proud of the city, strongly urged 
me to dispense with the usual visit to the grain eleva- 
tors and the stockyards, where hogs and oxen are 
slaughtered by millions and consigned to Europe, but 
to spend my time in inspecting libraries, schools, and 
museums. No city in the world can show such enor- 
mous endowments for educational, scientific, and chari- 
table purposes lavished within ten years, and still 
unlimited in supply. . . . The impression left on my 
mind was that the citizens of Chicago were bringing 
their extraordinary enterprise to bear quite as much on 
social, intellectual, and artistic interests as they con- 
fessedly do on grain, ham, steel, and lumber. They 
will have to do so if they are to hold their own in the 



future of civilization. For the manifest destiny of 
Chicago is to be the heart of the American continent." 

Of the future material supremacy of the 
American people, Mr. Harrison is as fully 
convinced as he is of the future predominance 
of Chicago among American cities. This 
supremacy is to result from our combination 
of large population, our educational agencies, 
our natural resources, and our social and politi- 
cal system, " more favorable to material devel- 
opment than any other society ever devised by 
man." The writer goes on to say : 

" It is a curious instance of the power of national 
egotism that Europe fails to grasp this truth — that 
Germans, with their wretchedly poor country, narrow 
seaboard, and scanty rivers, ports, and minerals, still 
aspire to the first place; that Frenchmen fail to see 
how their passion for art, rest, and home has handi- 
capped them in the race for supremacy in things ma- 
terial; that Britons, in their narrow island and their 
comfortable traditions, will not recognize that the indus- 
trial prizes must ultimately go to numbers, national 
unity, physical resources, geographical opportunities, 
trained intelligence, and restless ambition." 

But the triumphs of civilization are not all 
material, as our latest critic knows full well. 
He admits that our libraries are magnificent, 
that our educational machinery is " at least 
tenfold that of the United Kingdom," and that 
our reading public is enormous. With these 
patent facts, however, there goes the question 
whether " this vast prosperity, this boundless 
future, rests upon an equal expansion in the 
social, intellectual, and moral sphere." We 
must agree with him when he answers this 
question by saying that " they would be bold 
critics who should maintain it, and few think- 
ing men in the United States do so without 
qualifications and misgivings." The question 
can never be answered for good until our so- 
ciety is old enough to become organized in the 
sense in which the European societies are or- 
ganized, or until such organization shall have 
been clearly shown to be incompatible with the 
democratic ideal. At present, our society is 
"young, inorganic, and fluid," our culture is 
widespread but superficial, polished conversa- 
tion is not a daily practice in many of our 
circles, and the sense of noblesse oblige, " as a 
force constraining men in high office or in 
great social position, has hardly any equivalent 
in American life." 

A few other points made by Mr. Harrison 
are well worth mentioning. He believes, for 
instance, that '' the standard of material well- 
being in the United States reaches for the 
masses of the laboring people a far higher and 
more permanent point than has ever yet been 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



11 



attained by the laboring mass of civilized men." 
Speaking of the great fortunes that grow up 
in this country, he says that he " saw nothing 
to suggest that wealth in America is worse 
acquired or worse applied than it is in Europe." 
Perhaps the most pleasing of all his comments 
is the following : 

" I received a deep impression that in America the 
relations of the sexes are in a state far more sound and 
pure than they are in the Old World ; that the original 
feeling of the Pilgrim Fathers about woman and about 
man has su£Bced to color the mental and moral atmos- 
phere, and to give all sexual problems a new and clear 
field to develop in normal ways." 

We call this a pleasing observation, not be- 
cause it flatters us, but because we believe it 
to be — or, at least, to have been hitherto — 
one of the fundamental facts about American 
society. It is, moreover, precisely the sort of 
fact to which the vision of the foreign visitor 
does not easily penetrate, although it is deeply 
ingrained in the consciousness of every Ameri- 
can who has grown up in an American home, 
gone through the American public schools, and 
familiarized himself with the characteristic 
productions of American literature and art. 
If Mr. Harrison, in the course of his two 
months' stay, could realize this truth, our con- 
fidence in his judgments upon other and more 
doubtful matters should be considerable ; in a 
word, he is clearly of the observers who look 
beneath the surface of things, and whose opin- 
ions, even if formulated upon short notice, are 
bound to be treated with respect. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE SIMPLIFYING OF COLLEGE DEGREES. 
(To the Editor of Ths Diai.) 

Hereafter the UiUTeraity of wiU confer only one degree, the 

A.B., for ftll nndergrmdiute work. — Neu:t Item. 

Something more than a hundred years ago a striking 
epigram, that all men are born free and equal, got into 
the head of a brilliant Virginian, and thence upon a bit 
of paper that afterwards became celebrated as the 
Declaration of Independence. It sounded so well that 
men took it up as a slogan of war and went through the 
Revolution with it on their lips. But, for all its attrac- 
tive sound, our ancestors could not convince themselves 
of its truth, and utterly disregarded it when they came 
to the task of setting up a government. The epigram, 
however, did not die, but lived on in the mind and on 
the tongue of many an orator who went about pleading 
for it in the name of the people. And thousands loved 
it, despite its neglect by the majority. Its devotees 
had almost beg^n to lose heart; but now they may take 
courage, for the academic world has at last hit upon a 
plan whereby a beginning may be made toward putting 
it into practice. The plan is so simple, — indeed, it is 
based on an axiom, — that one wonders why it was not 



thought of long ag^. It is nothing more nor less than 
to recognize the fact that everything that equal men do 
is of equal value and should receive the same name. 

The honor of taking the lead in this movement must 
be given to the University of Timbuktu. The process 
of reasoning by which the faculty of this institution 
were brought to rearrange their whole plan of collegiate 
work was very simple: Culture is acquired by a study 
of the achievements of mankind. Now all men are 
equal, consequently all their achievements are equal, 
and of equal cultural value. The college as an institu- 
tion of culture must recognize this fact and govern its 
courses accordingly. 

A necessary corollary is that free men must be allowed 
the utmost liberty in selecting and arranging their work. 
Of course only one deg^ree, the A.B., which has always 
stood for the highest culture, will be given. Hereby 
the confusion arising from a multiplicity of degrees, 
which some regard as meaningless, and which at most 
merely indicate the lines along which a student has 
directed his work, will be avoided. Hereafter the A.B. 
will simply mean that he has acquired culture by some 
one of the manifold combinations of studies possible, 
through a system of choice and chance, with a thousand 
or more subjects to choose from. 

It will be impossible in a brief paper to give even the 
names of the many courses now offered at this institu- 
tion, covering, as they do, five hundred pag^s of its last 
Register; but the prospective student may be benefited 
by a perusal of one of the possible combinations.

Many of the conrses offered require only two hoars 
per week, and are pursued only three months, in order 
that the student may have a still wider range. A series 
of lectures by noted specialists is arranged for each 
year, attendance upon which may be counted for a de- 
gree. The writer was particularly struck by two of the 
courses announced for next year, " The Quintessence of 
the Asymptote " and <' The Sweet Influence of the 
Pleiades." 

Some colleges looked upon this as a rather startling 
departure, and were a little slow to follow it at first. 
In particular, objection was made to the introduction 
into collegiate work of such subjects as Torts, Obstet- 
rics, and the like, on the ground that they were profes- 
sional. Such absurd objections, however, arose from 
prejudice due to long established custom. Many insti- 
tutions now recognize this fact, but are afraid to cut 
loose from their old moorings too suddenly. They an- 
nounce that only one degree, the A.B., will be g^ven 
hereafter for collegiate work, and have gone so far as 
to say that some work which is commonly reg^arded as 
professional will be accepted for the last year's work 
in college. However, this timidity is fast disappearing, 
and it is only a question of time when the absurd and 
arbitrary distinctions between professional and non- 
professional studies in their relation to culture will be 
abolished. David Y. Thomas (M.A.).

"Gardens Old and New."* 

There is in England a sort of out-of-doors 
magazine known as " Country Life," which 
has been producing once a week forever a 
pleasant article on country house gardens — 
illustrated, of course. Sixty of these, collected, 
constitute the present volume bound with the 
slightly obvious title "Gardens Old and New." 
In a way, as a piiblication it may be consid- 
ered as the youngest and most charming de- 
scendant of such books as Nash's " Mansions " 
and Richardson's "Historic Houses," having 
sprung directly from that union of architecture 
and photography so evident of late in combi- 
nations of pictures and chatter of notable 
dwellings. Some of these have appeared for 
their own interest, and many as backgrounds 
for the interest of some personality ; but such 
as they are, historic mansions have of late 
teemed to such an extent that one now rec- 
ognizes them rather wearily. Since Nash has 
achieved a rare-book value in the market, and 
Richardson is used as an historical document, 
it may be seen that we have been taking our 
houses seriously for a very long time, and it is 
consequently somewhat of a relief to take to 
the garden. This present collection, therefore, 
with its fresh-air quality — its parterres, and 
rosaries, and general garden panorama — 
comes to a welcome long preparing for it. 

A republication in England and an importa- 
tion in America, the critic's relationship to the 
book is not the nearest, but is one remove, so 
to speak : since it is also published as a popu- 
lar volume, and is not aimed especially at land- 
scape architects and such, we may even take 
our gardens lightly, as gardens should be taken. 
The proper way to take a garden is, of course, to 
take it at five o'clock of a summer's afternoon, 
and to take it with tea. So, pushing open the 
window of any of Mr. Nash's mansions, we 
will step out upon the terrace, and turning our 
backs on the stuffy world of furniture and 
interior decoration, survey the English out- 
of-doors of five o'clock and " brillig " when 
shadows grow longer and cooler, the intervals 
between distant noises lengthen, and the silver 
and the porcelain clink in polite sotto voce 
near by.

Garden Environment. Illustrated. New York : Imported

Mr. Henry James has given well the at- 
mosphere of such a garden, in the " Portrait 
of a Lady," in the chapter which introduces 
the Touchetts : 

" Under certain conditions, there are few hours in 
life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the cere- 
mony known as afternoon tea. There are circumstances 
in which, whether you partake of the tea or not — some 
people of course never do — the situation is in itself 
delightful. Those I have in mind in beginning to un- 
fold this simple history offered an admirable setting to 
an innocent pastime. The implements of the little feast 
had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English 
country house, in what I should call the perfect middle 
of a splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon 
had waned, but much of it was left, and what was left 
was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk would 
not arrive for many hours, but the flood of summer 
light had begun to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the 
shadows were long upon the smooth, dense turf. They 
lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed 
that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the 
chief source of one's enjoyment of such a scene at such 
an hour. From five to eight is on certain occasions a 
little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the true 
interval could only be an eternity of pleasure. . . . The 
house that rose above the lawn was a structure to repay 
such consideration, and was the most characteristic ob- 
ject in the scene I have attempted to sketch. A long 
gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which 
time and the weather had played all sorts of picturesque 
tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented 
itself to the lawn, with its patches of ivy, its clustered 
chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The front 
of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with 
which we are concerned was not the entrance front; 
that was in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned 
supreme, and the wide carpet of turf that covered the 
level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious 
interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down 
a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the 
place was furnished like a room, with cushioned seats, 
with rich colored rugs, with the books and papers that 
lay on the grass." 

Then there is conversation, — but one may not 
quote a whole chapter. What has been given 
is an accurate and sympathetic word-picture, 
giving in color the leisurely and sequestered 
delights which the book we are talking about 
shows in black and white. 

But in spite of this eminent example, and 
heedless of the well-known peaceful character 
of gardens, the gentleman who begins the 
book under review (and maybe ends it, for it 
contains anywhere from one to sixty anony- 
mities) plunges immediately into all sorts of 
controversy. He chooses, curiously enough, 
as a motto for this proceeding, " Horas non 
numero nisi serenas,^^ and then lines up land- 
scape gardeners and architects in opposition, 
and makes the peaceful English close the 
battleground of opposing schools, who tear up

each other's shrubs by the roots, and call on 
the reader to decide. This seems to be not the 
nicest way to begin a book on gardens. Horas 
non numero if you like, nisi serenas that I 
insist on, — and escaped to the pictures. These 
are charming and many, — lawn and court, 
hill-side and bowling-green, ringed with moun- 
tain, moor, and sea ; gardens old and new, 
with much that is a revelation, especially in 
the old. 

Taken for the pictures, the book may be 
recommended freely, especially to the following 
people : First of all, to the minor architect, 
that it may cultivate in him a sense of mise- 
enscene. Secondly, to people who have no 
gardens and probably never will have any, 
especially school-teachers; its charming sug- 
gestion of quiet and peaceful leisure being 
offered to them in the nature of a consolation 
for their over-crowded days. Thirdly, to those 
who have gardens. This recommendation is 
made with the conviction that, as heretofore, 
those with gardens will get the book, and those 
without will never see it. Last Summer, a 
small Italian child who lives on the West Side 
of Chicago, near Hull House, invited someone 
there to come and see her garden. She led the 
way to the court-yard of the house, a space 
paved with brick, and not describable even by 
the most slip-shod as being with verdure clad. 
However — such is youthful resource — in the 
corner a brick was missing, and in its space 
she had planted a grain seed obtained from the 
feed-store next door. Placing her in class two 
of those I have named, she would undoubtedly 
enjoy the book — and with equal certainty, it 
may be said, she will never get it. It is true, 
however, a logician might consider she had a 
garden. 

A point of interest to democratic America, 
for whose benefit the gardens are transplanted, 
may be derived from an analysis of the contents 
of the volume. Of the sixty-six private grounds 
described, three belong to dukes, one to a 
marquess, nine to earls, some half-dozen to 
baronets, and the rest to commoners, lieutenant- 
colonels, honorables, and clergy of various 
degree. This is quite a representative list, and 
as one turns the pages and passes from Chats- 
worth, the possession of a duke, to Beaulieu, 
the residence of a marquess, from this to 
Porches, the country-seat of a mere earl, con- 
descending even to the homes of baronets 
(baronets date only from the seventeenth cen- 
tury), and finally sinking through the upper 



middle classes, in whose direction might one be 
supposed to break the tenth commandment ? 
In favor of the dukes and marquises and earls ? 
Not at all ; the haute noblesse do not seem to 
have much fun. It is not until one is well 
past the lower baronage, and is burrowing 
among the commoners, that the gardens one 
covets become frequent. These plain people 
have grounds that nestle snugly up to the 
house with a charming immediateness into 
which one can step from any door or window. 
They are also full of the most interesting things- 
— pergolas, for instance, pleached alleys, sun- 
dials, yew arbors ; while the landscape of the 
upper peerage has much gravel, many mouldy 
classic statues, black slaves (a favorite but 
unsightly form of fountain), bacchic vases, 
formal gardens, and geometrical flower-beds. 
The spaces around the great houses all seem 
(like Hampton Court, for instance, to dangle 
a well-known example) somewhat cold and 
bleak, with a remoteness altogether different 
from the coziness of the " domestic boskage " 
of the smaller and less stately houses. Of 
course, when a duke living in an artificial age 
pays no heed to the satires of Pope, but lays 
out his demesne in accordance with the arti- 
ficiality of the time, he does it on a scale of 
acreage and expenditure which means that his 
family or successors have this large, ugly thing 
" for keeps." It is too big and costly to wipe 
out. With the smaller houses it is different. 
They can change in a generation, and from 
generation to generation preserve all that is 
worthy in tradition, and, like freedom, 
" broaden down from precedent to precedent." 
Then you have your present properly backed 
up by your past, and can rest back comfortably 
supported by all the ages, instead of having to 
adjust yourself in a Procrustean manner to the 
measure of a period pilloried for your discom- 
fort. Such ducal gardens may have an his- 
torical value, as giving a sense of a certain 
age ; but the value of gardens is, after all, their 
value to life and to living, and however it has 
happened, the smaller closes here illustrated 
are, on this count, the more valuable. They 
are the ones to covet, to copy, to possess for 
the sheer delight in them ; and they are, hap- 
pily, the ones that may be coveted and copied 
and possessed with impunity. There is so much 
of consolation in this triumph of the intensive 
over the extensive, that I feel as though I had 
achieved almost the whole duty of a critic in 
pointing it out. George M. R. Twose.

[July 1, 



A Group of Nature Books.* 

It is a part of the progress of the day that 
Nature study is coming into prominence in our 
schemes of education, and, beyond these, is 
entering into our plans for coveted diversion. 
It necessarily follows that our press shall do 
its utmost to provide means, as far as it may, 
for pursuing this study ; and yet it is a real 
surprise that so large and increasing a number 
of each season's publications are devoted to the 
purpose. Above all, it is a surprise to discover 
the amount of talent, of industry, of patience, 
and of skill in all directions, that is lavished 
upon these works which are produced without 
stint of any sort, to allure and instruct the 
public. In turning over a collection of the 
more recent publications in this field, a keen 
enthusiasm is aroused over their high grade of 
excellence. Author and bookmaker have united 
in the noble intent to captivate while they en- 
rich the mind of the reader. 

First among those which delight our notice 
is " The Life of the Bee," by Maurice Maeter- 
linck. " Pray what is there new to be said of 
the bee ? " we ask ourselves with querying 
doubt, " and what has this sage philosopher, 
whose business heretofore has been with ques- 
tions concerning human life, its intimate objects 
and its possible future, what has he to do with

SO small and insignificant a subject ? " We 
open the volume, and are forthwith absorbed 
in the wonder and beauty of the facts and 
thoughts he presents. Here is no technical 
treatise on the builder of the honey-cell. The 
book strikes out an entirely new line in the 
narration of a story that has been ably rehearsed, 
in parts and in the whole, times without num- 
ber since Swammerdam began the tale in the 
seventeenth century. It is a mingling of the 
profound speculations of the seer, the magical 
visions of the poet, and the cautious conclusions 
of the man of science. As poet, Maeterlinck 
deals with bees as 

"The soul of the summer, the clock whose dial records 
the moments of plenty; they are the untiring wing on 
which delicate perfumes float; the guide of the quiver- 
ing light-ray, the song of the slumberous, languid air; 
and their flight is the token, the sure and melodious 
note, of all the fragile joys that are born in the heat 
and dwell in the sunshine. They teach us to tune our 
ear to the softest, most intimate whisper of these good, 
natural hours. To him who has known them and loved 
them, a summer where there are no bees becomes as 
sad and as empty as one without flowers or birds." 

As seer, he remarks that 

" In our endeavor to understand the intellect of the 
bees, we are studying in them that which is most pre- 
cious in our own substance: an atom of the extraordinary 
matter which possesses, wherever it attaches itself, the 
magnificent power of transfiguring blind necessity, of 
organizing, embellishing, and multiplying life ; and, most 
striking of all, of holding in suspense the obstinate force 
of death, and the mighty, irresponsible wave that wraps 
almost all that exists in an eternal unconsciousness." 

As man of science, Maeterlinck proves his 
right to recognition by his grasp of the knowl- 
edge gained by previous observers of the apian 
tribes, by his own peculiar acquisitions, and by 
the concise, comprehensive, and uniquely charm- 
ing method by which he passes it all over to his 
unlearned reader. In the final chapter on " The 
Progress of the Race " he uses ingenious argu- 
ment to show how transition, even in the bee, 
" is called for from a precarious, egotistic, and 
incomplete life, to a life that shall be fraternal, 
a little more certain, a little more happy," and 
concludes with the reflection that 
" In a world where nothing save a few facts of this 
kind indicates a precise will, it is significant enough 
that we should see certain creatures rising thus, slowly 
and continuously; and should the bees have revealed to 
us only this mysterious spiral of light in the overpow- 
ering darkness, that were enough to induce us not to 
regret the time we have given to their little gestures 
and humble habits, which seem so far away and are yet so 
nearly akin to our grand passions and arrogant des- 
tinies." 

Again a trite theme is handled in the volume 
on " Moths and Butterflies," by Mrs. Mary C. 
Dickerson, and again we are gratified by the

:fresh and engaging form it is made to assume. 
The intent of the author is to win the interest 
of the elementary student in entomology, the 
boy and girl who in the schoolroom or in the 
summer vacation would penetrate somewhat 
into the secrets of insect life. The guide who 
here offers to open out the way reveals rare 
qualities for the accomplishment of her task. 
By close investigation in the field, the labora- 
tory, and the library, she has become an adept 
in the work. So at ease is she by reason of 
the insight long training has yielded her, we 
follow on with undeviating trust and admira- 
tion. By a clear and connected exposition of 
the life-history of a few of the most notable of 
our moths and butterflies, the structure and 
habits and faculties of this group are made 
visible almost as though we looked through the 
€ye and the microscope at first-hand. lUus- 
irations of a value equalling the text, clear-cut 
and original, accompany it all along, throwing 
light on the minutest details. The book closes 
with a chapter explaining the relationship of 
moths and butterflies, their classification and 
ancestry, and adding complete directions to 
the novice for collecting and preserving them. 

If they who seek recreation at the seaside 
would but vary the day's conventional round 
with a little consideration of the marvels of 
animal and vegetable life that abound on the 
shores of the unfathomable ocean, life would 
be a dearer thing then and thereafter for the 
wholesome and inspiring influences brought 
into it. Pick up but one bit of weed washed 
up by the waves, examine it under the magni- 
fying glass, look searchingly but a moment into 
one of the pools held in the lap of the rocks, 
and if there lurk an atom of a naturalist's 
enthusiasm in your temperament you will feel 
that for an instant the glories of another and 
•upper world have flashed down on you. Then 
you will possibly cast about for some under- 
standing of the curious things that have been 
suddenly revealed, the strange, weird, beautiful 
shapes and movements existing in this unknown 
realm. For such inquirers, there is enlighten- 
ment in a study of " The Sea-Beach at Ebb- 
Tide," by Mrs. Augusta Foote Arnold. A 
wide gleaner will he be who descries any of the 
lower forms of marine life that are not named 
and classified in this capacious volume. Its 
descriptions are definite and simple, and the co- 
pious and exquisite illustrations lend a valuable 
aid to the identification of puzzling specimens. 

The name alone of Mrs. Mabel Osgood 
'Wright is needed to draw attention to a new 



book. Praise may be reserved, for the versatile 
charm of this writer is thoroughly understood. 
Her love of nature in its varying aspects sets a 
gentle imagination aglow, and a trail of pleasant 
light is left on every page her pen passes over. 
Her latest work, picturing " Flowers and Ferns 
in Their Haunts," has all the grace of the vol- 
umes that have gone before. It is set in the frame 
of a slender story, the characters of which afford 
occasion for diversity and individuality of ex- 
pression. We may believe it to be in the main 
a transcript of the writer's actual experiences 
in her search for the wild growths of the field 
and forest. Every accessory was present to 
make these experiences a pure source of joy and 
of health, and so vividly are they reported that 
the reader shares in them to the fullest extent. 
Full-page plates of surpassing beauty, veritable 
leaves from the book of nature, are scattered 
with a profuse hand through the volume ; while 
a multitude of delicate drawings inserted in 
the text are equally true to life, having been 
traced directly over original photographs. 

An amiable companion to Mrs. Wright's 
volume is one which travels " With the Wild 
Flowers from Pussy Willow to Thistle-down," 
by Maud Going (E. M. Hardinge). This 
work first made its appearance seven years ago, 
but its contents are still fresh in interest. 
They have a vital quality, and by careful re- 
vision are infused with the vigor and the aptness 
that befit the present hour. With much spirit 
and no little tact, a succession of the best-loved 
flowers that adorn the months from March to 
October are marshalled into line, and their 
distinctive features pointed out for our easier 
recognition, our deeper-seated admiration. Mrs. 
Hardinge's discourse is based upon a genuine 
knowledge of botany, and is ornamented with 
the refinements of a picturesque and fluent 
diction. 

The " Lovers of the Woods " who slip the 
handy volume bearing that title into their 
pocket for reading in a quiet hour will serve 
themselves acceptably. The author, Mr. Will- 
iam H. Boardman, has pressed into it much 
of the true essence of woodcraft, the fragrance 
of which is so grateful to the appreciative. 
The woods of which he writes are not located. 
Woods are woods, as he rightly indicates, any- 
where from Canada to either coast ; and '* all 
the exquisite refinements and amusements of 
the most highly civilized spot on earth can do 
no more" to secure him comfort who enters their 
precincts with a reasonably expectant spirit. 
"Absolute comfort for body and mind," he

adds, " is perhaps not the keenest enjoyment, 
but it is worth working for, and it can be had 
in the woods." It was to restore impaired 
health, we infer, that Mr. Boardman took up 
for a time the pursuits of a woodsman, cheerily 
dispensing with the helps and diversions of 
society and relying upon himself for the pro- 
vision of the chief necessaries for the support 
of life. He learned the art from a past-master 
of woodcraft, and with good sense and high 
courage was at once an apt scholar. He has 
little direct communication with his reader, 
but through speech with his guide and an oc- 
casional chance comrade he betrays the fact 
that he is a man of culture, and addicted to 
pithy reflections. " I 'd been careless," he 
makes a forest comrade say, " and carelessness 
is the worst fault a man can have, except lyin' 
about what he 's done." 

All that can be done by artist and artisan 
to perfect the externals of a volume has been 
done for the collection of " Nature Studies in 
Berkshire," by Mr. John Coleman Adams. 
The present is a new edition of the work which 
was fresh from the press two years ago. The 
price has been reduced one half, and still the 
book may be pronounced a volume de luxe, 
with its wealth of photogravures that deserve 
the rank of works of art from their skilful 
choice of subject and their delicacy and finish 
of execution ; and, with these, the harmon- 
ious details of print, paper, and binding. The 
text is the effusion of a poetic soul stirred 
by the romantic scenery of the Berkshire hills. 
One who has not fallen under the spell of the 
landscape in Northwestern Massachusetts might 
deem it a rhapsody ; yet no one can doubt it 
is the honest, as it is the impassioned, record 
of moods excited by rare passages of beauty in 
earth and sky. The trees, the brooks, the 
meadow lands, and the hillsides, with the drift- 
ing clouds and the floods of summer sunshine, 
are alike beloved by the writer, who paints 
their changing pageantry with sincere fervor. 

The camera has introduced a new and fruit- 
ful factor into the study of natural history. 
We are only beginning to test its usefulness, 
and yet the results already attained show the 
boundless possibilities of the instrument in the 
extension of accurate knowledge of the habits 
and the haunts of animals and plants with 
which there has been hitherto an obscure or 
misleading acquaintance. The ornithologist 
has been active in improving the opportunities 
the camera suggests ; but the one who at the 
present hour has accomplished the most inter- 



esting feats by means of it is Mr. Francis- 
Hobart Herrick, who has just given to the 
world his experience in photographing the 
" Home Life of Wild Birds." It is safe to 
say his account furnishes a greater body of 
fresh and trustworthy facts regarding the be- 
havior of birds in the nesting season than has- 
been offered in any single publication for a 
considerable time. Mr. Herrick's brilliant 
performance consists in bringing " the mountain- 
to Mahomet," or, in plain words, in bringing 
a nest that is hidden by impenetrable foliage 
in a tree or on the ground, out into the open^ 
where the eye of the camera can peer into it 
without obstruction. In the last two summers- 
he has thus placed under easy view twenty-six 
nests belonging to fifteen different species of 
birds. For example, a cedar-bird has built its 
home in a pine tree forty feet or more above 
the ground. The branch on which it rests is 
severed from the tree and fastened upon two 
stakes in an open field, four feet above the 
ground, and perhaps fifty feet away from its 
original site. Care is taken to effect this change- 
of location when the parental instinct is strong-^ 
est — that is, when the young are from four to 
nine days old. The parents are at first be- 
wildered and alarmed ; but the cries of their 
offspring lure them to the new situation, and 
soon they are feeding the chicks with their 
usual frequency and freedom of manner. A 
small green tent is now set up close to the nest, 
and in this concealment the observer watches 
the birds and photographs their every move- 
ment. It was Mr. Herrick's custom to spend 
the hours from nine o'clock in the morning to 
three in the afternoon, daily, within the tent 
(usually within a foot and a half of the nest), 
using pencil and notebook and camera in swift 
and exact report of every attitude and event 
affecting the parents and young. This patient 
and industrious study was pursued until the 
fledglings were able to take wing and depart 
finally from the scene. The data gathered in 
such favorable circumstances could not fail to 
be rich in novelty and value. Mr. Herrick's 
relation of the incidents observed is supple- 
mented by a series of reprints of his photo- 
graphs, which furnish much fresh evidence 
pertaining to the history of birds in the most 
important period of their lives. 

A life of five years of unalloyed happiness 
was the lot of " Mr. Chupes and Miss Jenny " 
in the loving care of their gentle mistress 
(Miss Effie Bignell) living in a college town 
in New Jersey. Mr. Chupes had fallen out of

the nest in the early pinfeather stage, and, 
despite the cries of mother robin and his own 
vigorous protest, was made captive and trans- 
ferred to a human habitation. It was a short 
time before he was quite at home in the new 
surroundings, and though allowed later the 
liberty of sallies out of doors, his affection for 
bis mistress had quenched the natural thirst 
ior freedom. In the autumn a companion of 
his own kind was found in the person of Miss 
Jenny, a neglected, caged prisoner, discovered 
in a baker's den. How the two throve, how 
intelligent they proved, what individuality each 
possessed, and what endearing traits they dis- 
closed, is told in a way that could scarcely be 
bettered. It is likely to make the warm-hearted 
sigh for a pair of pet robins, yet there are pen- 
alties to be paid for such particular privileges, 
and it is quite as well, as a rule, to enjoy them 
in another's experience, as Miss Bignell has 
permitted her readers to do. 

One comes into quick communion with Brad- 
ford Torrey in any piece of writing, however 
sketchy, he affixes his name to. The element 
of personality is so strong in his utterances 
that he appears to be actually present in the 
fashioning of his sentences. It is difficult to 
understand why this is so — perhaps because 
-what he says comes so directly and frankly from 
the heart, making itself felt as an exact repre- 
sentation of a true and simple selfhood. Add 
to this an indefinable literary charm, and his 
popularity as a writer is accounted for. His 
latest book contains a score of short talks about 
our " Everyday Birds," which one is likely to 
meet in any ramble along country roads. The 
work is announced as of an elementary nature, 
prepared especially for children ; but one need 
not be dwelling in the period of adolescence to 
enjoy it from cover to cover. A notable feature 
of the book is the reproduction of twelve col- 
ored plates from Audubon. 

Twenty " Bird Portraits " by Ernest Seton- 
Thompson are sufficient of themselves to give 
distinction to a volume. These portraits have 
a vigor, a boldness, a certainty in the handling 
and a lifelike character which command instant 
consideration. They are allowed ample space 
in the volume, and are set in landscapes which 
give them an imposing effect. The descriptive 
text, by Ralph Hoffman, is of secondary import- 
ance. So eloquently do the pictures delineate 
the separate features of the bird, the dominant 
traits in its character and environment, they 
can afford to dispense altogether with explana- 
tory comment. Sara A. Hubbard. 



Some Recent Books of Sport.* 



Mr. Henry P. Wells may not be as " con- 
templative " a man or as bewitching a writer 
as was Izaak Walton, but he is certainly a 
fisherman of far more skill and experience — 
for, as is now admitted, honest Izaak was bat 
an incomplete angler after all, and not to be 
mentioned, in point of piscatorial learning, 
with his " most honored friend, Charles Cotton, 
Esq." But Mr. Wells certainly knows all 
that the most ambitious mortal need know 
about fishing, and his book on " Fly-Rods and 
Fly-Tackle " is an encyclopaedia in its kind. 
Fishermen need scarcely be told that the book 
has for nine years or so been perhaps the au- 
thority on its subject. They will at all events 
be glad to know that a new edition of it, re- 
vised, supplemented, and partly re-written, is 
now ready. How exact a man the author is, 
how honorably ambitious to add something to 
the sum of human knowledge, may be gathered 
from his account of a projected experiment 
(which we trust will one day be carried out) 
through which it was proposed to learn precisely 
^' how lines, leaders, and flies appeared to trout 
under the varying conditions of light and water 
which confront the angler when rod in hand." 
Mr. Wells goes on to say : 

" My plan was to procure a diver's outfit, together 
with the necessary skilled assistance, and at various 
depths beneath the surface of the water, and over light 
and dark colored bottoms, and in sunshine and shadow, 
myself impersonate a fish while a friend angled for me, as 
it were. Thus, and with the aid of telephonic communi- 
cation and a stenographer, I hoped in two or three weeks' 
time to make quite an impression on the problem." 

The above " experiment " — Mr. Wells imper- 
sonating a fish and angled for by his friend, 
with full telephonic apparatus and a shorthand 
reporter on the bank — would certainly be 
worth going miles to see, and public notice of 
its occurrence ought to be given.

THE DIAL 



[July L 



Mr. Wells's book, as its title imports, is largely 
devoted to the description and discussion of 
the angler's tools and tackle. He tells us how 
hooks, rods, reels, lines, flies, and so forth, are 
made, and lays down the principles that ought 
to govern us in our choice of them. There is 
a chapter on " Repairs," and one of " Miscel- 
laneous Suggestions." " Casting the Fly " and 
" Flies and Fly-fishing " are separately and 
instructively treated. The text is pretty plenti- 
fully sprinkled with cuts of the right sort — 
that is to say, of the purely illustrative and 
useful sort, — and the frontispiece shows Mr. 
Wells himself, rod in hand, " attending of his 
trembling quill," and pleasantly conscious of 
" a bite." No angler, however experienced, 
need fancy that he can find nothing new in this 
suggestive (and not too big) book. But it is 
addressed chiefly to beginners, and contains 
mainly, the author says, such information as 
he would himself have most thankfully received 
during his novitiate. 

The advent of the golfing season brings with 
it a boon to the novice and to the player of 
average accomplishment, in the shape of a 
manual on " Practical Golf " by Mr. Walter 
J. Travis. Mr. Travis's name is, of course, a 
power on American links. He is not only a 
past-master of the manual dexterities of the 
great game, but a student of its theoretical 
principles as well. Your average " profes- 
sional " is usually a man of fine physical equip- 
ment, who plays largely by rule-of-thumb, 
trusting for results to the skill of practice ; 
one who can show you promptly in any given 
case how the thing ought to be done, but if 
pushed by the inquisitive tyro as to why it 
should be done in precisely that way and no 
other is often brought to a standstill. Not so 
Mr. Travis. He has thought the game out. 
He can tell you why, if a stroke be played so 
or so, under a given set of conditions, it must 
theoretically be followed by such or such results. 
Mr. Travis, in short, is a rational or reasoning 
golfer, who plays an intelligent and intelligible 
game. He is therefore well qualified to teach, 
and his book shows the due blending of matters 
of theory and practice. Ample and convincing 
directions are given as to stance and grip, the 
swing, putting, approaching, the choice of 
clubs, the construction of courses, handicap- 
ping, etc. In an appendix one finds the Rules 
of Golf, Special Rules for Stroke Competitions, 
a Glossary of Technical Terms, and so on. 
Mr. Travis being, like Sarah Battle of immortal 
memory, a stickler for the " rigor of the game," 



appends also those decent conventions known 
as the " Etiquette of Golf," which, he adds^ 
" shall be as binding upon players as the other 
Rules of the game." The text is supplemented' 
by many instantaneous photographs showing 
Mr. Travis in a variety of contingencies doing 
the thing as it ought to be done. The book 
is actually instructive, and no golfer who means 
to master the game should overlook it. 

In " an age of ell-wands and unjust bal- 
ances," as Carlyle genially called our trading- 
and money-getting times, the art of swords- 
manship is fallen in abeyance. The trick of 
fence is forgotten. The good knights are dust,, 
their swords are rust ; and if your neighbor 
offend you, you have him up in court, instead 
of pinking him, in a manful and chivalrous 
way, through the midriff. Some high-spirited 
Tybalts there are whose tastes revert fondly to 
the days of the duello, who make a cult of the 
sword, and would gladly refer their disputes to 
the issue of the wager of battle, were ic not for 
the unpleasant consequences attached by a 
huckstering and prosaic age to even such gen- 
tlemanlike breaches of the peace. Such a fine, 
medisBval soul, we take it, is Captain Alfred 
Hutton, late of the King's Dragoon Guards, 
and author of the handsome volume now before 
us, entitled " The Sword and the Centuries."" 
The portrait of the author prefixed to the vol- 
ume, showing a keen, D'Artagnan-like visage,^ 
with hawk's eye, and waxed, up-turned mous- 
tachios, bears out our impression of his char- 
acter. Captain Hutton has already published 
several other books on the weapon he so affects, 
notably " Cold Steel " and " Old Sword-Play,"^ 
both of them works of authority in their field. 
One might think that he had by now pretty 
well exhausted his subject, if not his enthusi- 
asm ; but in the present volume we see how 
much freshness may be imported into a well- 
threshed theme, if only the writer changes his 
point of view of it. Captain Hutton is still, 
as before, the historian and eulogist of the 
sword ; but his method now is, while recounting- 
the story of the development and manipulation 
of the weapon, to instruct his reader and en- 
liven his narrative by casting the latter mainly 
in the form of a chronological account of notable 
encounters exemplifying the practice of swords- 
manship, from the Age of Chivalry when great 
lords jousted at the barriers beneath the ap- 
proving eyes of beauty and royalty, down to 
the days of Figg and Sutton (arcades amhoy 
when prize-fighters slashed and maimed each 
other for the amusement of the assembled

brutes, titled and other, at Hoekley-in-the- 
Hole (frequented by Pepys) and Mary-le-bone. 
Captain Hutton's book, in fine, may be fairly 
characterized as a description, from a most 
competent and sympathetic pen, of the various 
swords used in civilized Europe during the 
past five centuries, and of notable and typical 
single combats which have been fought with 
them. The volume is suitably and attractively 
illustrated. 

While Captain Hutton's hobby is the sword, 
that of Mr. Walter Winans is the revolver. 
Captain Hutton wants us all, for our health's 
sake, to learn to fence ; Mr. Winans, on much 
the same grounds, wants us all to learn to 
shoot. The Captain, on the whole, seems to 
have the better of the case, since public lon- 
gevity would hardly be promoted were every- 
body to take to peppering at a mark with a 
revolver. But be that as it may, there is no 
question that Mr. Winans's sumptuous book 
on "The Art of Revolver Shooting " is a com- 
plete and authoritative manual which amply 
supplies the want of a work of the sort. Mr. 
Winans's book is virtually first in its field, and 
it is not likely soon to have a rival. The author 
is, as every sportsman knows, the champion 
revolver-shot of Great Britain — an "artist," 
in fact, second only to the incomparable Cheva- 
lier Ira Paine, whose recent death deprived the 
world of a man who could do things with a 
revolver which must have given him an ill 
repute in the days when the black art flour- 
ished. In Mr. Winans he has found a worthy 
successor. As a pistol-shot Mr. Winans began 
early — as a small child in frocks, in fact, 
when, in lieu of a rattle, he had a pistol of the 
French Fiobert variety, with which he used to 
shoot at paper targets, " snuff " candles, knock 
over tin soldiers, and so on. The child was 
father of the man, and Mr. Winans (now well 
along in years) has been popping away strenu- 
ously at a target ever since, bent on scoring as 
many bull's-eyes as possible, and wasting no 
care on the minor concerns of life. Happy he 
who has a hobby, be it ever so small a one, and 
the time and means to ride it. 

Mr. Winans's book is meant primarily to 
instruct, and he begins at the elements of his 
" art." The evolution of the revolver is sketched, 
after which the leai-ner is told how to select, 
handle, and take care of the weapon. Special 
chapters are devoted to the Bisley rules and 
competitions, to practice and training, to gal- 
lery shooting, stage shooting, trick shooting, 
game shooting, pigeon shooting, to shooting 



from a bicycle, and what not. In short, about 
every question likely to be asked touching the 
uses of the revolver is replied to clearly and 
authoritatively in this exhaustive book. We 
are glad to note that the folly of that large and 
jocular class of persons who can never see a 
pistol lying about without picking it up and 
pointing it at you, and who appear later at the 
coroner's inquest with the old " didn 't-know- 
it-was-loaded " plea, is attended to by Mr. 
Winans, who of course (his home being a sort 
of arsenal) has had some narrow escapes 
from it. Mr. Winans thus relates how he 
once left a revolver lying on the table in his 
Bisley tent : 

"Some visitors dropped in, one by one, to lunch. 
First came an elderly lady. She sat down near the 
table; her eye fell upon the revolver. She instantly 
snatched it up with a laugh, and pointed it at me with, 
•I'll shoot you!' I made her put it down, and was 
explaining to her how injudicious it was to point a re- 
volver at anyone, how it might have been loaded, etc., 
when in came a parson. He sat down and began talking 
pleasantly. Presently his eye caught sight of the revol- 
ver. Grabbing it, he shouted: 'Now I'll shoot you! ' 
and pointed it at me, roaring with laughter. I locked 
up that revolver." 

Mr. Winans's book is profusely and attrac- 
tively illustrated, and is an alluring one out- 
wardly even for those who care little for its 
theme. 

" The Woman's Book of Sports " is a pretty 
and practical little publication, which the ama- 
teur sportswoman will do well to slip in her 
satchel when she goes for her summer's outing. 
The elementary features and principles of the 
outdoor games most affected by the gentler sex 
are clearly and attractively set forth, but the 
distinctive feature of the book is its treatment, 
from the woman's point of view, of sports gen- 
erally supposed to be reserved for, or mainly 
enjoyed by, men^ — namely, football, baseball, 
yacht-racing, rowing, athletics, and so on. 
Technical terms are explained, and the main 
points of each sport made clear. The chapter 
on yachting has been especially prepared with 
an eye to the coming contest for the America's 
Cup, so that the reader may fully understand 
and enjoy the accounts of the race, or the race 
itself if she be fortunate enough to witness it. 
The chapters on Golf and Tennis are rudi- 
mentary, and the novice will find them useful. 
The book is well described as a practical guide 
by a practical writer for the amateur sports- 
woman. It is illustrated with full-page pic- 
tures appropriate to the text.

Recent Books of Travel.* 

The extent to which modern methods of illustra- 
tion has developed finds no better proof than in 
recent books of travel. A few years ago the trav- 
eller was obliged to supply his own sketches, or let 
his book go forth with nothing more intimately 
descriptive than its text. To day there is no jour- 
neying without a camera, and the aspects of the 
remotest regions are made familiar even to the child 
who cannot read. But it is this growing familiarity 
with the world as a whole which is, after all, the 
most wonderful thing. If the armies and navies 
of Christendom stand ready to seek out a new spot 
on the globe that they may devour it, the traveller 
blazes the way for the more peaceful ministrations 
of commerce. Through him the consciousness of 
universal humanity which must spring into universal 
charity with increased knowledge becomes ours, and

the opportunity is given for the real illumination of 
the darkest spots on the earth's surface. 

The recent sending forth of emissaries from 
French, Canadian, and American newspapers to 
prove just how quick a girdle may be put around 
the earth, gives more than ordinary value to the 
Rev. Dr. Francis E. Clark's <' A New "Way Around 
an Old World." One of the first of civilians, if 
not the very first, to avail himself of the possibili- 
ties of Russia's new Trans-Siberian railway, the 
outbreak of hostilities in China made the road un- 
available except for military purposes immediately 
after he had crossed into Europe. Dr. Clark is the 
President of the United Society of Christian En- 
deavor, and his official presence was required in 
China and Japan and, later, in England. He arrived 
in Vladivostock on May 1, 1900, just as the ad- 
vancing season released the Amur River from ice 
and made the journey across Siberia by steamboat 
and rail then possible for the first time. He notes 
that the forging of this link makes a circuit about 
22 000 miles long around the earth, all within the 
north temperate zone, 9,000 miles of this journey 
being by sea and 13,000 by land and river. The 
book is unpretentiously written, intensely sympa- 
thetic with Rus&ia, and rather remarkable for a calm 
incidental denial of all rights and virtues to the 
Chinese. 

In abrupt contrast with Dr. Clark's superficial 
praise of Russia, based upon what could be seen 
from a car window or the deck of a river boat, are 
the observations of Mr. J. Stadling in his " Through 
Siberia." Well known as a traveller and sociologist 
in his own country (Sweden), and long a student 
of Russia and its affairs, he undertook the explora- 
tion of the Siberian coast line on behalf of the 
Swedish Anthropological and Geographical Society, 
of which Baron Nordenskjold was then the chair- 
man, having for his chief incentive to this task the 
hope of finding some trace of the unfortunate An- 
dr^ti, his former associate. Mr. Stadling left St. 
Petersburg on May 1, 1898, reaching Sehigalova 
on the upper Lena four weeks later. Thence he 
took boat for the mouth of the Lena, 3,000 miles 
distant, intending to go overland by sledges to the 
Lower Yenesei. At Kangelak, an island in the 
Lena delta, the explorer was frozen in, within a 
short distance of the spot where the lamented crew 
of the " Jeannette " met their fate. Eventually he 
was able to make good his original plan, sledging 
across the tundra to the Anabar, to the Katanga, 
and over the Tamyr peninsula to the Yenesei, which 
was ascended in sledges over the ice, eventually 
reaching civilization, after a journey of 15,500 
miles, at the close of the year 1898. The realities 
of Russian maladministration, especially in refer- 
ence to the convict system, are prominent upon Mr. 
Stadling's pages. Everywhere there is officialism 
and failure, with an appalling preponderance of 
crimes of violence. Among the natives of Asiatic 
Siberia the Russian influence has been even more

demoralizing, the exactions of the authorities having 
forced the unhappy people, in more instances than 
one, into cannibalism. The story is vividly told, 
and in convincing detail. 

Chungking, commercial metropolis of the Chinese 
province of Szechuan, lies 1.500 miles from the 
mouth of the Yangtzekiang, thus affording Mr. 
Archibald Little a favorable starting-point for the 
walking-tour he describes in his " Mount Omi and 
Beyond." He began his journey on July 7, 1892, 
and covered 1.300 miles in eighty days at a total 
-cost of about two hundred and fifty dollars, a con- 
siderable portion of the expense being incurred for 
the carriage of the cumbrous copper or silver cur- 
rency which he was compelled to use. Three weeks 
brought the pedestrian to the sacred mountain of 
the Buddhists, and his adventures there, while the 
priests were soliciting contributions in quite the 
manner known at home, are told with great good- 
nature and vivacity. He entered Thibet near Ta 
■Chien Lu, on the last day of August, after skirting 
the Snowy Mountains ; he remarks on the limpid 
beauty of the stream that runs through the town, 
and adds, " Curious that the pollution of water, 
which is a sin against religion nearly throughout 
Asia, should be a matter of sublime indifference in 
' enlightened ' Europe and especially in England." 
In this region he found both Chinese and Thibetan 
Buddhist temples, the contrast being unfortunate 
for the Lamas, whose gloomy creed seemed to have 
made little impression on their merry followers, 
intercourse with whom Mr. Little enjoyed greatly. 
Taking another tour over the same ground some 
years after, he observes : 

" It is sad to one who, like myself, travelled in the 
province ten years ago, before this influx [of missionary 
bodies], to note the difference. Then I never beard an 
uncivil word; now one is constantly jeered at by the 
rabble, and a favorite amusement of the small boys in 
the villages around Chungking is to draw crosses in the 
path, hoping that the advancing pedestrian may not 
dare to tread on them. The erection by the missions 
in Chungking, in conspicuons sites, of strange-looking 
buildings, which interfere with the so strongly implanted 
fungshui superstitions of the natives, was one of the 
main causes of the Chungking riots of 1886. What- 
ever be the cause, the temper of the people is entirely 
changed for the worse." 

Mr. Clive Bigham's former books of travel, and 
his known experience as an attache of the British 
embassies at St. Petersburg, Constantinople, and, 
until recently, at Peking, give his " Year in China, 
1899-1900 " more than ordinary title to considera- 
tion. Throughout this work may be read the broad 
sympathies of a man of the world, his earlier train- 
ing as a soldier leaving him not without consideration 
for an enemy in the field. He was present at the 
advance upon Peking known as " the Admiral's 
Expedition," describing one of the Boxer attacks 
upon the allies as follows : 

" They came on us in a ragged line, advancing at the 
doable from a village some quarter of a mile to the left 



flank. Not more than a couple of hundred, armed with 
swords, spears, gingalls, and rifles, many of them being 
qnite boys. To Liiyone who had been some little time 
in China it was an almost incredible sight, for there was 
no sign of fear or hesitation, and these were not fanatical 
« braves,' or the trained soldiers of the Empress, but the 
quiet, peace-loving peasantry — the countryside in arms 
against the foreigner. As they approached they dropped 
on their knees, lifting up their hands to heaven to in- 
voke the God of War, the chief of their Boxer free- 
masonry. Then they charged until they dropped again as 
oar volleys began to tell. In twenty minutes they were 
in full retreat, leaving some sixty dead on the field." 
Mr. Bigham announces his intention to avoid politi- 
cal questions, and his book is a cheerfully written 
description of his journey from Canton to Hankow, 
to Peking, through Manchuria and eastern Siberia, 
through the Korean littoral to Seoul, up the Yang- 
tzekiang to western Szechuan and down the river 
again to Tientsin and Port Arthur, the book con- 
cluding with a brief survey of the fighting around 
Peking, the campaign on the Amur conducted by 
the Russians, and the journey back to Europe over 
the Trans-Siberian railway. One of the general 
conclusions of the volume deserves citation : 

" The European in considering the Chinese character 
should recollect that the Aryan and the Yellow races are 
physically and mentally distinct. What would appear 
truth and reason to one often seems folly and lies to 
the other. Our ideas of history, of ethics, of domestic 
life, and even our logic and system of reasoning, fre- 
quently run quite counter to what the Chinaman respects 
and believes. And our victories do not by any means 
convince him that he is wrong and that we are right. 
One should therefore guard against getting a wrong 
perspective of China and of its people by endeavoring 
to apply to them European standards of comparison." 

" Japanese Plays and Playfellows " is written by 
Mr. Osman Edwards after six months' sojourn in 
Japan, and is most entertaining, though necessarily 
superficial in its account of the native theatre, with 
which most of the book is concerned. However, 
superficial as it is, it has the merit of being told at 
first-hand, from personal observation and intimate 
conversations with native actors. The author dis- 
cusses the religious drama, still in the condition of 
the mediaeval miracle-play of Europe, and shows 
the difference between that and the delicate art of 
Mr. Obojiro Kawakami and Mme. Sada Yacco, 
this latter the first of her countryfolk to lay off the 
Elizabethan convention which denies women appear- 
ance on the stage. There is an entertaining little 
conversation reported with the celebrated Ichikawa 
Danjuro, who represents the classic tradition of the 
Japanese stage, one question and answer reading 
thus : 

" ' How is it you have avoided the master-passion of 
our London actors to become an actor-manager? ' 

" ' I think a manager must be sorely tempted to put 
money first and art second. I often advise authors to 
make certain alterations in the play for which I am 
engaged, but the responsibility of entire management 
would distract me from the purely artistic aspect of 
representation.'"

A mach-needed explanation is made of the position 
of the geisha, and a chapter is devoted to the most 
striking phase of Japanese social naorality, in which 
Mr. Edwards displays a sympathy as illuminating 
as it is rare. The book is one of real importance, 
being illustrated by twelve pictures in color by 
Japanese artists, delicious in design and execution. 

" Sands of Sahara " is the appropriate title given 
by Mr. Maxwell Sommerville, Professor of Glyptol- 
ogy in the University of Pennsylvania, to a some- 
what formal account of a journey from Syracuse to 
Algiers, and thence through Algeria, Tunis, and 
Tripoli, by way of Lambessa, Touggourt, and 
Temacin. The book, while addressed to the sim- 
plest comprehension and rather didactic in tone, 
contains excellent descriptions of the Roman city 
of Thimgad and of the various tribes of Kabyles 
and Bedouins met on the expedition, with many 
curious instances of superstitions brought forward 
by the traveller's quest for amulets among the na- 
tives. It is beautified by reproductions of photo- 
graphs, which have all the charm of finished pictures 
from an artist's hand. 

A number of books concerning Morocco have 
been written by Mr. Budgett Meakin, and these are 
now followed by " The Land of the Moors " from 
the same hand. Like ancient Gaul, the book is 
divided into three parts, the first devoted to the 
natural and physical characteristics of northwestern 
Africa, the second to the political aspects of its 
various divisions, while the last, under the head of 
"Experimental," contains accounts of journeys made 
through the territory discussed in the earlier part 
of the volume. The eighty-three illustrations from 
photographs are augmented by a map, the details 
of which are fully authenticated, leaving great areas 
as little known as any portion of the earth's surface. 
One of the curiosities of geography is embodied in 
the author's search for Miltsin, a mountain described 
early in the last century by an explorer, but now 
seemingly lost beyond the power of recovery. Mr. 
Meakin's bicycle tour is described with much humor, 
one of the dialogues between the rider and an on- 
looker reading thus : 

" < But what sort of beast are yoii riding? We 
thought it must be " a drinker of wind," ' — whereby is 
denoted a certain fleet camel used on the desert, seldom 
seen now in Morocco. 

" ' Why, dear no; it 's only a mule, a Nazarene mule, 
you know,' — for everything outside Morocco is either 
called Roman or Nazarene. 

" « You don 't mean to say so ! How do you breed 
them? ' 

«• < Well, you can see for yourself from its speed that 
its mother must have been a gazelle, and from these 
round parts and iron that its father must have been a 
reaping-hook.' 

"A moment's 'stare while trying to realize whether 
this could be the truth or not, and out they burst in a 
hearty laugh, for the Moors do enjoy a joke, and this 
was one which specially appealed to them, so to every 
new-comer it was repeated as fact in most solemn tones." 



The humor which is incidental in Mr. Meakin's 
work is dominant throughout Mr. Herbert Vivian's^ 
" Abyssinia." This is the third book of travel from 
this entertaining hand, and it is to be hoped that 
anyone who can extract so much amusement from 
sojourning in strange parts and share it so delight- 
fully with his readers may long be spared to wander 
over the least-known parts of the earth. Mr. Vivian 
was long enough in the land of Prester John ta 
reach the capital from Aden by way of British 
Somaliland, to interview King Menelik, and return 
by the way he came. He prefaces his narrative of 
travel with a brief historical account of the Lion- 
Land, which unwittingly suggests a paraphrase of 
the freshman's answer, " As I understand the sub- 
ject of Abyssinia, it is a subject which is not well 
understood." He has a number of political con- 
clusions to draw, most of which are to the effect 
that England was wrong in surrendering any ter- 
ritory to the Abyssinians. His portrait of the King 
is well done : 

" He wore clean bright blue woolen socks and new 
tennis shoes of a common kind, with the tongues hang- 
ing out and no laces. Over close-fitting white linen 
knickerbockers came a loose garment of handsome 
green and gold striped silk. It had long, tight sleevea 
buttoned at the wrists, and when he moved his legs I 
saw that the garment was lined with common calico. 
Under it he wore a white shamma with a red embroid- 
ered line near the edge, and over everything a black 
silk cloak with gold embroidery and small gilt buttons. 
On his head was a big grey felt hat with a high crown 
and broad brim. In his left ear was a diamond solitaire 
earring, about the size of a threepenny-bit and set in 
gold. This is worn in evidence of his Laving killed 
elephants, and only the royal family are permitted to- 
wear gold in any form. . . , 

" His face is not so much marked with smallpox as I 
had been led to expect. He is darker than the average 
Abyssinian, but his features are not those of a negro. 
His mouth, however, is quite negroid, and his thick 
lips wear an incessant grin, displaying large, very white 
teeth set loosely together. His small brown eyes wore 
an expression of fatigue, and what bhould be the white* 
of them were yellow. His forehead is narrow, but the 
upper part of his face appears to have much character 
and kindliness. His beard and whiskers are very close 
and curly, and inclined to be grey. His voice is soft 
and rather oily, without any vestige of the usual 
Abyssinian squeak. He speaks very deliberate!}', show- 
ing his teeth and tongue and wagging his head a good 
deal. He makes no gesticulations with his hands, ex- 
cept that he sometimes puts his finger-tips together. 
On the whole I should describe his as rather an eccle- 
siastical manner." 

While Great Britain was occupied with the 
burghers in South Africa, in the spring of 1900,. 
the Ashantis took occasion to make a bold strike 
for independence, bursting into hostilities while the 
Briti&h executive, Sir Frederic Hodgson, K.C.M.G.r 
Governor of the Gold Coast, was holding a "palaver" 
with the native kings at Kumassi — formerly spelled 
Coomassie. The attack was wholly unexpected and 
hardly prepared for, the Governor having taken hi&

wife with him on the journey. It is Lady Hodgson 
who now writes an account of the beginning of the 
war, calling it " The Siege of Kamassi," from the 
principal episode in it. The story is told with great 
spirit and simplicity. Lady Hodgson describes 
what she saw, her hasband having made it his rule 
never to discuss political aspects of his duties with 
her, and her book is lacking in any account of the 
manner in which the revolt was finally crushed. 
Throughout the book there is calm and tacit denial 
of any right on the part of the Ashantis to govern 
and rule themselves, and instances of barbaric 
savagery to justify the British conquest are cited — 
though it seems to be true that the presence of the 
English has led to greater bloodshed than was ever 
known in the land before their coming. The siege 
of Kamassi began on April 25, 1900 ; Governor 
Hodgson and his wife left it in possession of a small 
English force on June 23 ; and the siege was finally 
raised a few days later. Thirty-three Europeans, 
720 Hausa (native) soldiers, and several thousand 
refugees were beleagured by many thousands of 
Ashantis, many of them well armed. The journey 
back to the coast was a most arduous one, and 
many deaths resulted from the progress through a 
hostile land. After concluding her story of her 
own adventures. Lady Hodgson adds a chapter or 
two on the condition of the capital of the colony. 
So much has been written recently about the lack 
of capacity for improvement in the negro that a 
word from her may be quoted : 

" I have met some charming [black] African ladies, 
and am glad to say that in my ten years' experience of 
the Gold Coast each year improves the position of 
women, and to-day they — I am speaking of educated 
women — are not the slaves to their husbands that they 
were a few years ago. It has been most interesting to 
watch the growth and civilization of the community, and 
it really seems marvellous how Accra has advanced in 
the last few years, even in the matter of entertainments." 

Though " S de Lights on the March," Mr. H. F. 
Mackern's contribution to the history of the war in 
South Africa, is not strictly a book of travel, it may 
be classed with the book preceding and with the 
later chapters of Mr. Clive Bigham's work, being 
rather impressions received by a stranger and on- 
looker than a detailed narrative of hostilities. Mr. 
Mackern is an American from New York, whose 
point of view is best told by himself in discussing 
the ardent admiration conceived for the United 
States by the British when they found the world 
against them in their conquest of the two Republics. 
Noting the enthusiastic twining together of the 
Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes, he adds : 

" Such proofs should be most gratifying to those of 
us who are broad-minded enough to grasp their true 
meaning, to those who think for themselves, and are 
not influenced by sensation-seeking editors or gallery- 
talking politicians; even though some of the latter have 
poured out their eloquence in Congress, while lacking 
absolutely a clear understanding of the actual state of 
affairs in South Africa, which forced Britain into a war 
which she would rather have averted. 



" But the pablic will not he fooled by these states- 
men who are ever on the look-ont to work on the sos- 
eeptibilities of the ignoiant. The men found pleading 
for the Boers are those who wanted to recognize the 
so-called Cuban Republic, even when the combined 
United States Army and Xavy were not able to locate 
it; the same patriots who, by their absurd notion of 
justice (to call it nothing worse) encouraged the Phili- 
pinos to shoot down our boys, and for the sake of such 
cheap notoriety as they can get, are willing at any time 
to embarrass the government." 

Though this would seem to indicate that Mr. Mac- 
kern needs the experience of travel in America and 
acquaintance with the history of this country more 
than anything else, hia book will not be found lack- 
ing in a certain charm. He celebrates the war- 
correspondents in South Africa, more than a third 
of whom, he notes, were killed or incapacitated in 
the discharge of their duties. He was with General 
French at Elensburg, and saw the British flag raised 
over Bloemfontein and Pretoria. He has nothing 
but praise for the British, even to the point of 
stating that '■ Any remarks that may seem to be 
criticisms are not intended as such." Altogether 
the narrative is an excellent specimen of the work 
of a person unknown in our history for more than 
a century — the American Tory. 

Worlds away from this Anglicized American in 
sympathy for the inhabitants of a foreign land, 
Mr. Montgomery Carmichael has successfully in- 
terpreted for his readers the realities and idealities 
of no small portion of Italy in his charming book, 
"In Tuscany." He feels at liberty to set forth 
differences not less than resemblances in national 
characteristics ; but he nowhere insists that failure 
to comply with British requirements constitutes in- 
feriority, and in more cases than one he actually 
conveys the impression that English-speaking people 
can learn much to their advantage from the Italian- 
speaking peoples. What he calls "the conclusion 
of the whole matter " is worth giving in full : 

"With all his faults. In spite of all the difficulty we have 
in comprehending his character, In spite of contradic- 
tions, complexities, and crudities, the Tuscan is perhaps 
the most charming of all the children of Adam, just as 
his country, in spite of all Its drawbacks, in spite of 
fierce heat, damp, sclrocco, tramontana, mosquitoes, and 
all the plagues of a vexatious bureaucracy. Is more 
nearly like the Promised Land than any other. Bat to 
live in that enchanted laud and dwell among its siren 
people needs an apprenticeship not easy to serve, and 
many a Philistine from beyond Jordan cancels his arti- 
cles early in the apprenticeship and flees the country 
in affright or disgust. It is often only after years of 
hard service, constant uneasiness, and continual per- 
plexity, that the stranger sojourning in the land awakens 
one day to find that he is dwelling In Eden, and sees 
on all sides of him, living In the flesh and working In 
the spirit, characters and ideals which had dimly figured 
among the dreams he dreamt in the far-off days of his 
generous, romantic boyhood." 

It may readily be conjectured that the charm and 
glory of Tuscany is transferred to Mr. Carmichaers 
pages. He has been content to let others tell of

the obvious things, while he dwells on matters which 
until now have hardly been disclosed to us. The 
result is a book to keep, for its freshness of spirit 
and interest make it worth reading more than once. 

Without defining with scientific exactness the 
boundaries of the delightful country of which he 
speaks, Mr. William A. Dutt makes the " Highways 
and Byways of East Anglia " very real to a dweller 
in a distant land, his pleasant text being interpreted 
and supplemented by Mr. Joseph Pennell's delight- 
ful drawings. "Some parts of Norfolk, Suffolk, 
and Cambridgeshire " is the phrase which defines 
the limits of this journey of love, and though the 
author complains that his itinerary will be " as re- 
markable for what it misses " as for what it brings 
to his readers, these latter will find but little fault 
after enjoying the feast he spreads for them. Lit- 
erature and history have been drawn upon about 
equally to enrich and beautify the narrative, and it 
will be found a treasure-house of the things which 
are best worth knowing. The author says : 

" I could never find it in me to decry East Anglian 
scenery because of its tameness; rather, I could pity 
the man who is unable to discover in its quaint old- 
world hamlets, thatched farmsteads, and ancient shrines 
many elements of the picturesque. As for the historical 
interest of the district, it both gains and loses some- 
thing in that many of the events in which it originated 
occurred so long ago that they have become inseparably 
associated with romantic legends and untrustworthy 
traditions." 

The book has the rare merit of serenity, and is to 
be valued highly. 

This is to be an article of contrasts, for a more 
disheartening book than Mr. Hesketh Prichard's 
"Where Black Rules White," an account of a 
journey made by the author in the republic of Hayti, 
is hardly to be found among recent publications. 
It is a book of comparisons, and these not of what 
Hayti was aforetime and has now become, but what 
Hayti is and what the best civilization of the world 
has become. It is truly a tale, as the English author 
avers, of a people who " are neither very brave nor 
very fierce ; not even barbaric ; merely barbarians." 
There is a detailed account of Vaudoux practices, 
and of official inefficiency, of militarism and the 
rule of might. The whites are feared, because the 
blacks believe them anxious to return them to 
slavery,— so Mr. Piichard informs us, — and this is 
the only reason he can give for the curious blindness 
to a natural love for self-government that seems to 
be growing into an " Anglo-Saxon " idiosyncrasy, 
which he exhibits in the following words : 

" The surprising part of it is that these negroes, who 
bear with incredible wrongs and tyrannies from their 
illiterate masters, would resent the mildest sway at- 
tempted by those not of their own race and color. The 
lowest of the people are as frantically opposed to an- 
nexation by a white Power as are the ruling classes." 

Mr. Prichard's book bears out to the full some 
of the conclusions respecting the negro embodied 
in Mr. Poultney Bigelow's " The Children of the 



Nations." This, though it is all that its sub-title 
announces in being " A Study of Colonization and 
its Problems," is based so largely upon the author's 
extended travels and observations at first-hand that 
it may be included here as well as elsewhere. " If 
many of my conclusions vary from those current," 
says Mr. Bigelow, " it will be found that I have 
drawn less from official reports than from personal 
inquiry and observation." The result is one that 
possesses to an unusual degree the quality we all 
know and admire under the name of " common 
sense." Eminently sane in most of his conclusions, 
there is an enormous extent of territory, almost 
the whole world outside of Europe, covered by Mr. 
Bigelow's studies. Not only is the history of colo- 
nization set forth, in so far as it is pertinent at the 
present day, but the conditions of nearly all the 
colonies or self-governing nations which have sprung 
from them are exhibited as they are at the present 
moment. There is a personal tribute to the Filipino 
character in the too brief chapter on the Philippines, 
and the usual calm statement of American short- 
comings by which more than one member of the 
Bigelow family has earned the gratitude of those 
among his countrymen whose esteem is best worth 
having. It is only in the chapter on " The Negro 
as an Element in Expansion " that Mr. Bigelow 
seems lacking in human sympathy, for in it he ad- 
vocates strongly what can be regarded as nothing 
less than qualified slavery for the American man 
of color. This, it would appear, is not to be done 
as a method of education, but because the negro 
race is inferior : " Our first duty is to recognize the 
truth that the negro is not the equal of the white 
man." The question is too broad to be entered into 
here, but the statements of the book in this respect, 
like all its contents, deserve study. 

Sir Martin Conway enjoys a reputation deservedly 
great as a climber of mountains, and the fame gained 
from his previous exploits will suffer no diminution 
through the deeds set forth in his last book, on 
" The Bolivian Andes." On September 10, 1898, 
he reached the summit of Illimani in the Cordillera 
Real, about 22,000 feet above the level of the sea. 
Sorata baffled him on the first attempt, a heavy 
storm driving him from a point not far from its 
summit; but he surmounted the peak known as 
Anohuma on October 10, the height attained being 
about the same as that of Illimani. These were the 
real deeds of the journey to Bolivia, the other peaks 
ascended being much lower, and the service per- 
formed in relation to them being that of an explorer 
rather than a mountain climber. The book is ad- 
mirably written, and is filled with information con- 
cerning the native Indians and their somewhat 
desultory government. An account of a revolution 
that did not revolve very far adds to the interest 
of the book. It is admirably illustrated.

ration of the real pleasure she was able to extract 
from a somewhat commonplace trip through no 
magic more wonderful than the determination to 
try to understand the strange people she had to 
meet. Though the book is needlessly slight, it is 
really entertaining, human sympathy making ade- 
quate compensation for occasional flippancy. 

Another unpretending narrative of a trip to 
Mexico, preceded by one to the Pacific Coast and 
thence southward, comes from the practised pen of 
Col. A. K. McClure, the veteran editor and public 
official of Philadelphia. The book has for its title 
" To the Pacific and Mexico," and though the 
country traversed is fairly familiar, Colonel Mc- 
Clure's descriptions and impressions of it are pleas- 
ant and informing. An error (twice occurring), in 
making the Santa Fe railway run through the Grand 
Canon of the Arkansas is to be noted. 

In "The Niagara Book" a number of distin- 
guished Americans have joined forces to describe 
the greatest of American spectacles. Mr. Howells 
has one of those pleasantly intimate descriptions of 
his journeys to the Falls which remind us of a no 
less genial if not so witty Dr. Holmes ; Mr. Clemens 
gives " Some Extracts from Adam's Diary " to ac- 
count for several things about Niagara ; Professor 
N. S. Shaler popularizes the scientific aspects of the 
cataract so far as its geology is concerned ; and 
there are numerous other articles of interest mingled 
with instruction. The book is issued in full recog- 
nition of the Buffalo Exposition, and a chapter is 
devoted to it as a worthy adjunct to the more per- 
manent splendor of Niagara. Wallace Rice.

War has been adequately dealt with in imaginative 
prose. Taking his own city of St. Louis for the 
principal scene of his story, Mr. Churchill has made 
a masterly reconstruction of its life during the years 
just preceding the outbreak of hostilities, as well as 
during the trying years of the war itself. The 
value of the book lies chiefly in its blending of a 
minute and intimate study of the conditions in the 
single State of Missouri with a vivid and passionate 
realization of the national aspects of the crisis in 
question. The spectacle of the house of the nation 
divided against itself is reproduced in miniature in 
the division of the individual families of a State 
whose sympathies were so nearly balanced that for 
a long time it was uncertain which side it would 
take in the impending conflict. That Missouri was 
saved to the Union Mr. Churchill attributes mainly 
to the energetic action of General Lyon and to the 
German element in the population of St. Louis, an 
element inspired by the Continental ideals of 1848, 
and ready to fight once more in the defense of those 
ideals. As a story of private interest, " The Crisis " 
proceeds upon familiar lines. There are the two 
contrasting types of Puritan and Cavalier — the 
one a young man who embodies the New England 
tradition; the other a high-bred young woman of 
Southern extraction, the descendant, in fact, of the 
author's own Richard Carvel and Dorothy Manners. 
Except for the special delineative skill exhibited 
in the present case, this story has been told a hun- 
dred times before. Likewise, the incidents of battle 
have a familiar guise. The generous rivalry between 
the Northerner and the hot-blooded Southerner, 
enabling the one to save the other's life more than 
once, is an old enough story, as is also the story of 
the heroine, who struggles for years against an in- 
stinctive love which is at variance with all the 
traditions of her race. But the writer never allows 
us to forget the momentous issues that lie back of 
this network of individual relations, and, being 
himself of the younger generation that knows of the 
war only as recorded history, he can approach his 
subject with a due sense of its perspective, and re- 
main sufficiently objective to preserve his artistic 
poise. Besides the hero and the heroine, there are 
two other private characters that enlist our sympa-

thies in a marked degree. One is Colonel Carvel, 
Virginia's father, the embodiment of those admir- 
able traits which have always characterized the 
Southern gentleman at his best ; the other is the 
stern, almost fanatical, Northern sympathizer, 
Judge Whipple, who faces the world with a front 
of granite, and whose heart is as tender as that of 
the great President to whom its full allegiance is 
given. We have reserved for the last what we have 
to say about Abraham Lincoln as he appears in this 
book. We meet him face to face upon two occasions 
— once during the progress of the great debate 
with Douglas, once at the close of the war, and on 
the eve of the tragic consummation of his career. 
But his presence is felt as a pervading influence 
throughout the book, and the author's greatest 
triumph is found in the effective way in which he 
has dealt with the sacred memory of Lincoln. For 
it surely is a triumph to portray that personality in 
such terms of tenderness and reverence that the 
tears start unbidden with almost every mention of 
the name. We believe that this book will do more 
than all the histories to make the new generation 
understand the passion that inspired those days of 
the fifties and sixties, with their high purpose, their 
heroic resolve, and their moral fervor. Of late, the 
Republic seems to be forgetting the ideals that made 
of the Civil War so much more than a political 
struggle, and such a book as " The Crisis " cannot 
fail to be productive of much good in reviving, not 
merely the memories, but the fine idealisms of the 
period in which it moves. 

Another young writer, Mr. Owen Johnson, has 
taken the Civil War period for the subject of a 
novel, and has achieved a certain measure of suc- 
cess, although there is nothing about the book that 
is likely to make a lasting impression upon its 
readers. What is most noticeable is a sort of easy 
fluency, almost volubility, which permits a rather 
simple narrative to be expanded into a novel of 
some four hundred pages. The hero is a young 
man of Southern antecedents, who goes to Cleve- 
land to carve out his fortunes. When the war 
begins, he is a successful man of affairs, and finds 
an opportunity for service to his country by accept- 
ing a post in the commissariat department. His 
honesty and personal courage enable him to thwart 
many a rascally contractor, and helps us to realize 
that laurels may be won upon other fields than those 
of battle. The title of the book, " Arrows of the 
Almighty," seems to suggest a study in heredity, 
and this is doubtless intended by the writer, but we 
cannot say that the problem is worked out with 
much distinctness. The opening chapters, des- 
criptive of the hero's parents, and of his child life 
in Maryland, are much better than those that follow. 
They arouse, indeed, anticipations for the subse- 
quent development of the story that are doomed to 
disappointment. 

Mr. William Farquhar Payson has found an in- 
teresting theme for a historical romance in the for- 
tunes of that famous Lost Colony sent out by Raleigh 



in 1587. In the matter of invention he has been 
greatly daring in one respect, for he has made no 
less a person than Christopher Marlowe a member 
of the expedition. His story deals with exciting 
adventures on the voyage to Virginia, with Spanish 
intrigue to defeat the purpose of the colony, and 
with the long years of struggle, and hope deferred, 
and eventual failure on the Island of Roanoke. 
We owe him a debt of thanks for having "rigidly 
suppressed " the padding of " manners and cus- 
toms " that most writers make it a point of misguided 
conscience to put into such a work. John Vytal, 
the hero of this romance, is a finely conceived figure, 
the very incarnation of Elizabethan strength and 
endurance, and the woman whom he serves and 
unsinfully loves proves a most acceptable heroine. 
This woman is the mother of Virginia Dare, the 
first English child born in America. As for the 
poet of " Tamburlaine," we are glad to have him 
of the company, albeit at some strain upon the 
probabilities, and his speech and conduct are such 
as befit the man who, had he lived, might have dis- 
puted with Shakespeare the primacy of English 
song. 

Old Manhattan at the close of the seventeenth 
century is the scene of " Patroon Van Volkenberg," 
a historical romance by Mr. Henry Thew Stephen- 
son. A Huguenot exile from France is the hero, 
and he comes to America in search of a sister who 
had been sold into service as a redemptioner in 
New York. He finds that she has met a mysteri- 
ous and tragic death at the hands of her master, 
the powerful and unscrupulous patroon who gives 
the book its title, and he seeks to avenge her. In 
the end, vengeance is left to Providence, for the 
patroon has a daughter, and — well, we can imagine 
the rest. The story has a pronounced melodramatic 
flavor, and is replete with stirring incident. As a 
portrayal of the semi-feudal patroon system, it is 
interesting and instructive, and it shows us much 
of the diflBculties of the English rule in these early 
days when the civilization of the New Netherlands 
was rather Dutch than English. The redoubtable 
Captain Kidd plays a minor part in this history, 
although he can hardly be said to appear as one of 
the characters. 

Mr. Hamlin Garland, during the past few years, 
seems to have taken the far West for his province 
rather than the middle West, which was the scene 
of his earlier novels. The change is for the better 
in itself, and has been accompanied by an increased 
strength both in grasp and in vitality. The finer 
graces of diction are probably beyond his reach, 
whatever the themes he may attempt, but he is 
acquiring a certain rough force and breadth of style 
that make his work impressive. He is fortunate, 
moreover, in the mountain setting of these later 
books — "The Eagle's Heart," which we reviewed 
not long ago, and " Her Mountain Lover," the 
occasion of the present remarks. He is imbued 
with a genuine passion for the hills, and the rough 
sincere types of character which that environment

seems to foster find in him a sympathetic inter- 
preter. He gets at times very close to the poetical 
mood, and his revolt from the artificial sarroandings 
of civilization becomes more and more pronounced. 
In " Her Mountain Lover " the scene, for the most 
part, is not the West at all, but the England of 
town and country. This appears to contradict 
what has just been said, but a word of explanation 
clears away the difficulty. His hero in the present 
•case is a rough Westerner, prospector and cowboy 
at once, who goes to London for the purpose of 
selling a mine. The impact of this strange figure 
apon English society provides the book with its 
substance, and Jim Matteson so dominates every 
situation in which he is placed that all the English 
accessories of the story are just so much stage- 
setting for this one uncompromisingly far Western 
character. The difficult situation is very well 
managed, and Jim more than holds his own upon 
all occasions. There are suggestions of Mr. Bret 
Harte in the story, and there is even a certain sort 
of grim humor, which shows that Mr. Garland has 
indeed developed. 

"John Charity," by Mr. Horace Annesley Vachell, 
is a story that seems to have been written with an 
eye to the English public, and comes to our table 
heralded by a chorus of English critical trumpet- 
ings. And the opening chapters, placed in England, 
are so cleverly written in the familiar style of the 
English novel of adventure that it is not easy to 
realize that we are plunging into a story of Amer- 
ican life by a typically American novelist. Mr. 
Vachell needs no introduction to our readers. We 
have had the pleasure of praising his earlier work ; 
we now have the pleasure of praising the present 
strong and well-constructed romance. It deals with 
California — the California of the years just before 
the American occupation, the California of Alva- 
rado and Vallejo, of aristocratic Spaniards and 
Mexican intriguers, of sen )ritas and vaqueros and 
priests. It is a highly colored romance, and its 
outcome is essentially tragic. The figure of Alva- 
rado himself is studied with much skill and sym- 
pathy, while the appearance of Thomas Larkin as 
one of the minor characters provides a suggestion 
of what is soon in store for the unhappy province, 
and casts a sort of prophetic tinge over the narra- 
tive. 

The " American Novel Series," started by one of 
our most respected publishing houses at the begin- 
ning of the current year, and planned to include a 
new volume for every month of the twelve, is at- 
tracting much attention by the excellence of the 
books presented. The first two volumes of the 
series were reviewed by us some time ago, and were 
productions distinctly above the average of current 
fiction ; the volumes that have followed have proved 
to be better yet, and the promises made for the 
undertaking have been more than justified. " Mar- 
tin Brook," by Mr. Morgan Bates, is the first of 
the new issues to demand our attention. Mr. Bates 
is a veteran journalist of the West, and has achieved 



some success as a playright, but this is tbe first novel 
from his pen that has come to our notice. Com- 
bining, as it does, the skill of the practiced writer 
with the refined experience of life that comes from 
many years of observation, it is a book that com- 
mands consideration, and deserves high praise. It 
is essentially a story of middle New York in the 
middle period of the century, with the Abolitionist 
agitation and Methodist revivalism for its distin- 
guishing features. We might have spared the latter 
of the two. which rather weakens the story, for its 
strength is found in its reproduction of the moral 
fervor of the movement in behalf of the slave — its 
reanimation of the spirit of a time that to readers 
of the younger generation must seem to have been 
a part of the dark ages. It is well in these days of 
slackened national will and degraded political ideals 
that those years of storm and stress should be 
Titalized for us as has been done by Mr. Bates ; we 
need the contagion of the earnest and uncompro- 
mising spirit with which slavery was fought in the 
forties and fifties to arouse us to a sense of duties 
of our own time. The madness of imperialism that 
has taken possession of our people during these 
later years calls for a moral crusade as determined 
and as self-sacrificing as that in which our fathers 
were enlisted half a century ago. Mr. Bates has 
written a novel of one figure, and almost of one idea. 
We have spoken of the idea ; let us say of the figure 
that it depicts a hero worthy of the championship 
for which he stands, a strong, simple, manly char- 
acter, whose development we follow from childhood 
up, and whose devotion to a sacred cause enlists 
our warmest sympathies all through the period of 
strife, and up to the final triumph of the idea to 
which all his energies have been devoted. Inci- 
dentally, we would like to say that the book reminds 
as in many ways of the best work of the late Harold 
Frederic. It is not merely that it introduces us 
once more to the environment of central New 
York during the war period ; the resemblance goes 
beyond that, and includes the exhibition of many 
intellectual and moral traits that the author has in 
common with his late fellow journalist and fellow- 
worker in the field of fictitious narrative. 

New York is the scene of still another of the 
novels of the series now under review, but in the 
case of Mr. E. W. Townsend's " Days Like These," 
it is the city, not the State, which circumscribes the 
field of interest. This is the first appearance of the 
creator of Chimmie Fadden in the character of a 
full-fledged novelist, and even those who have ad- 
mired him the most for his studies of metropolitan 
low life are likely to be surprised by the versatility 
of the present work, and by the resources at its 
writer's command. The habit of journalism is in- 
imical to the cultivation of literary grace, and the 
finer qualities of style are still beyond Mr. Town- 
send's reach. But journalism has also its virtues, 
and " Days Like These " makes the most of them. 
It is a vivid and animated story, full of keen obser- 
vation and shrewd comment, and with no rhetorical

surplusage. It is a story of marked realism, which 
is, however, of the good compressed sort, not the 
sort that runs to cataloguing and the multiplication 
of irrelevant and uninteresting detail. The story 
is compounded in about equal measures of the two 
sharply contrasting elements of New York society 
— the life of the slums and the life of the regions 
in which wealth and refinement hold sway. Mr. 
Townsend is intimately acquainted with both fields, 
and considers them equally interesting as subjects 
for the exercise of literary art. On the whole, his 
millionaires are somewhat less convincing than his 
ruffians and other figures of the slums, but all are 
studied carefully enough to excite and hold our 
attention, besides being brought into interesting re- 
lations by means of an exceptionally well-contrived 
plot. As a study of the various elements that enter 
into the social structure of the great city the book 
has more than superficial truth ; it seems to us to 
exhibit an unusual degree of social penetration. It 
is satirical, after the manner of Thackeray — or, 
to take a closer parallel, after the manner of Mr. 
Warner's trilogy of New York novels, — but its 
shafts are not poisoned, and the author is prompt 
to give credit to the generous qualities that are 
somewhere stirring in the most selfish or depraved 
of his creations. He considers environment and 
education, rather than inherited viciousness, to be 
responsible for most forms of wrong living, and 
takes pleasure in discovering a soul of good in 
things and lives of the most evil seeming. He has 
written a strong human novel, faithful to the life 
with which it deals, enlivened by dry humor and 
dramatic incident, optimistic in temper, and free 
from explicit moralizing. " Days Like These " is 
one of the very best novels of the year. 

The third book in this series still remaining for 
notice is the work of a woman. Miss Geraldine 
Anthony, and is entitled " A Victim of Circum- 
stances." It is, like the one last mentioned, a story 
of New York society, although the action takes 
place largely at a country house on the Hudson. 
We regret that so poor a book should have found 
admission to the series. It is not only amateurish 
in construction, with characters so much alike that 
it is almost impossible to disentangle them, but its 
substance is the merest frothiness, being dialogue 
empty of thought and chronicled doings devoid of 
the least vital human interest. A sort of cheap 
and slangy brilliancy is the cachet of this produc- 
tion, which represents about the lowest depth of 
vapidity that the novel of fashionable society is 
capable of reaching. 

" The Heritage of Unrest," by Miss Gwendolen 
Overton, is a vividly realized narrative of the 
Southwest — the Apache country — in the days of 
Geronimo and Crook. The heroine is a waif of 
mixed Indian and American blood, adopted as a 
sort of ward by an army officer, who eventually 
makes her his wife. The study of her character, 
in which the savage instincts now and then find 
their way to the surface, despite the most thorough- 



going discipline in the ways of civilization, is ex- 
ceedingly well done, and makes us look forward 
with some eagerness to further work by this new 
writer. This is the personal sense in which the 
title of the book is justified ; but in a wider sense, 
the " heritage of unrest " may be taken as meaning^ 
the national heritage that comes to us from our 
blundering and dishonorable treatment of our 
Indian wards. The writer is unsparing in her de- 
nunciation of our course toward these unfortunate 
creatures, and a fine contrast is afforded between 
the steadfast devotion of our soldiers to their task 
of stern repression, and the folly, or worse, that has 
really been responsible for the chief difficulties.. 
The scene of this story is not strictly that which 
Mr. Bret Harte has made his own, but it is nearly 
enough that scene to invite a comparison, and this 
comparison may be best made by simply stating^ 
that Mr. Harte's work might be something like thia 
if it were stripped of humor and romantic glamour. 
The evident note of Miss Overton's work is a rather 
bare realism, but we must respect it, for it is based 
upon a close acquaintance with the scene and the 
period. 

The American Colonial period has proved unex- 
pectedly rich in the material for romantic fiction. 
Its annals are dull and uninteresting only to the 
undiscerning eye, and we have had of late numerous 
illustrations of the fact that it needs but a touch of 
the imagination to light up the history of our na- 
tional beginnings, and to awaken our deepest inter- 
est in the life of those early days. The latest novel 
to deal with this period is one of the best that have 
yet been produced; it is entitled "The Making of 
Christopher Ferringham," and is the work of Miss 
Beulah Marie Dix. The Colony of Massachusetts 
Bay is the scene of this story, and the time is that 
just preceding the Restoration. Christopher is a 
young Cavalier, possessed alike of the vices and the 
generous qualities of his class, sent to Massachusetts 
after the defeat of his cause, and placed under the 
tutelage of his uncle, a Puritan magistrate. His 
conduct is a stumbling-block and an offence to the 
godly townsfolk of Meadowcreek, and he seems, 
indeed, to be about as graceless a scamp as is often 
found anywhere. There is a young woman, how- 
ever, in his uncle's family whose sympathies turn 
toward him in spite of herself, and it is his love for 
her that gradually transforms his character, and 
redeems him from his reckless mode of life. As 
the title informs us, the story is of Christopher's 
" making," by dint of his love and of the discipli- 
nary environment against which he vainly chafes. 
After a long series of escapades and exciting ad- 
ventures, he grows up to be a man in the best sense 
of the word, and is happilv united to the young 
woman who has been his good angel. The author's 
study of the Puritan life and character is both 
painstaking and just. She does not spare its un- 
lovely aspects, but she recognizes at the same time 
its strength, and even the humanity that remains 
at its heart, in spite of its stern repression of most

of the Dataral instincts. Miss Dix has given as a 
deeply interesting book, rich in incident, and full- 
blooded in sympathy. It has about equal value as 
a -work of fiction and as a historical study of what 
is perhaps the most fascinating phase of our colonial 
experience. 

Miss A. C. Laut's " Lords of the North " is a 
rather striking story of adventure in British America 
during the early years of the nineteenth century. 
It has for its subject the rivalry between the two 
great fur-trading companies of the North, and pre- 
sents a vivid picture of the daring enterprise and 
reckless deeds of the men who were engaged in 
exploiting the commercial resources of the wilder- 
ness that stretches westward from Hudson's Bay. 
There is enough of private interest and delineation 
of individual figures to furnish forth an interesting 
narrative, but the epic character of the struggle is 
what chiefly impresses the reader — that, and the 
spacious atmosphere of the work, with the zest of 
living that such surroundings inspire. 

Of Miss Margaret Potter's '• The House of 
Mailly " we must say, in substance, what we said 
of her " Uncanonized " of last year. It is a work 
that exhibits a remarkable mastery of the required 
historical material, as well as the most painstaking 
construction. There is still much surplusage in the 
form of dialogue and description, making the nar- 
rative too slow in its movement, and depriving the 
reader of the sort of breathless excitement which 
he has a right to expect from a historical romance. 
The period is the France of Louis XV. and the 
reign in the royal favor of Madame de Chateau- 
roux. The day of the Pompadour has not yet 
dawned, although that remarkable woman appears 
in the closing chapters. The hero is a nobleman 
who aspires to the love of the King's favorite, and 
thereby incurs the royal displeasure. Banished 
from Versailles, with permission to return when he 
shall bring a wife with him, he goes to the Amer- 
ican colonies, and for about a third of the book 
the scene is laid in Maryland. This agreeable 
diversification is very well contrived, and the chap- 
ters that keep us in Baltimore are, on the whole, 
the pleasantest of all. A colonial maiden is intro- 
duced, and in her love the wounded heart of the 
hero finds solace. The final section of the story 
takes us again to the French court, where the 
beauty of the American countess wins instant ap- 
plause. This young woman has made a study of 
alkaloid poisons, and her special knowledge of the 
subject is turned to ingenious account. This sounds 
more melodramatic than it really is, but the use 
made of the episode, although skilfully contrived, 
introduces a hopelessly incongruous element into 
the romance. 

If we ask just what is lacking to this book of 
Miss Potter's, with all its admirable qualities of 
description and characterization, the answer is easily 
provided by Miss Bertha Runkle's " The Helmet of 
Navarre." In this book we find the true spirit of 
romantic adventure, and just the sort of construc- 



tive skill that Miss Potter has yet to learn. This 
is a book that one wants to read straight through; 
the other is one of which the reading can be broken 
off almost anywhere, to be resumed at convenience, 
and without the sort of impatient expectation that 
is so considerable an element in the novel-reader's 
delight. One thinks more of the story itself than 
of the painful conscientiousness of the telling, and 
we trust that with a little more practice in her art 
Miss Potter will learn this secret also. " The Hel- 
met of Navarre " deals with the most fascinating 
period of French history, with the League, and 
the B^arnais, and Mayenne. Many as have been 
the previous uses of this romantic material. Miss 
Runkle's story manages to preserve the qualities of 
freshness and charm. It has amateurish qualities 
as well — among them a fondness for bits of French 
which are usually more accurate than the souvent 
homme trahie which makes its luckless appearance 
in two or three cases, — but it certainly is a remark- 
able work for a beginner, and one who is a young 
girl at that. 

Mr. Christopher St John's novel, " The Crimson 
Weed," takes its text from one of Bacon's essays. 
" Revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more 
man's nature runs to, the more ought law to weed 
it out." It is this crimson weed of vengeance, grow- 
ing up in the life of a man, the child of dishonor, 
that we are called upon to consider in the present 
instance. The hero is a youth of mixed Italian and 
English parentage, who learns the secret of his 
origin when he has come to manhood, and whose 
mind is almost wrecked by the discovery. His 
Italian mother is still living, an artist upon the 
lyrical stage, and his father is a prosperous English 
Academician. The hero himself has the tempera- 
ment of genius, and has developed remarkable apti- 
tudes for both musical and literary composition. 
But he so broods over the thought of the wrong 
that has been done him through his unhappy mother 
that he grows well-nigh distracted at the contrast 
between her life of bitterness and the worldly pros- 
perity of the man who deserted her so many years 
ago. He is on the point of taking vengeance into 
his own hands, when fate intervenes and puts an 
end to the scoundrel who has caused all the misery. 
The story is skilfully-constructed, and its pitch of 
passion is almost unrelieved from first to last. In 
the end, the blasted lives of mother and son ar6 
restored to something like sanity, and the stormy 
prelude finds a peaceful close. 

It was inevitable that the Dreyfus affair should 
suggest a theme to some enterprising novelist, and 
we are glad that so clever a craftsman as Mr. John 
Oxenham should have been the one to find inspira- 
tion in that tragedy of real life. " Our Lady of 
Deliverance " is the title of his story, which tells 
how a French officer is degraded and exiled through 
the personal malice of a rejected suitor for his sister's 
hand (and fortune), how an adventurous English- 
man falls in love with the sister and espouses the 
cause of her brother's rehabilitation, how the neces-

sary pooof of his innocence is brought to light, 
the victim freed, and the villain circumvented. It 
is all made into a thrilling sort of narrative, with 
plenty of subsidiary incident, local character study, 
and general animation. It is not as good a story 
as Mr. Oxenham is capable of writing, but it serves 
the purposes of entertainment so well that we will 
refrain from carping criticism. 

Dr. William Barry is proving himself a novelist 
of admirable parts and amazing versatility. The 
religious and ethical prepossessions of his first 
books, "The New Antigone" and "The Two 
Standards," gave place in " Arden Massiter " to 
the romantic spirit of modern life as illustrated by 
the conditions of nineteenth-century Italian history, 
and that point has in turn given place to the Celtic 
glamour in "The Wizard's Knot," the author's 
latest work of fiction. In this book we have the 
Irishman — more or less concealed from view in 
Dr. Barry's earlier books, — with his sense of the 
haunting mysteries of the elements, his passionate 
attachment to his legendary birthright, and his 
primitive passions. The story itself is not without 
interest, but these extra-fictional qualities, which 
might be exhibited almost as well without attempt- 
ing to tell a story, are what give to " The Wizard's 
Knot " its deepest charm. The author's crisp and 
brilliant style, scholarly but without affectation, is 
a source of unfailing satisfaction, and would lend 
distinction to a much duller narrative. We do not 
place this book quite as high as " Arden Massiter," 
all things considered, but it remains nevertheless a 
noteworthy production. 

Mr. Charles Marriott is a new writer, and his 
first novel, " The Column," has been hailed in En- 
gland as a remarkable work. It is a novel of 
almost purely psychological interest, written in a 
style that arrests attention and occasionally puzzles 
it. There is a tendency toward something like 
preciosity in many of the sentences which consti- 
tutes Mr. Marriott's chief defect as a stylist. Such 
a sentence as the following, while not so bad as to 
deserve the title of Meredithian, is not to be de- 
fended upon any theory of lucid construction. " In 
spite of the pilloried names of sentimental history, 
and the prosier, though in a sense not less stimu- 
lating, records of the daily press, there still survives 
a popular and pathetic fallacy that the amateur of 
hearts abandons his desipience at the altar." It is 
only fair, however, to say that this is an extreme 
illustration of the author's morbid shrinking from 
the forms of common-place utterance. As a rule, 
he succeeds in being perspicacious without reverting 
to hackneyed forms of expression. The work as a 
whole is amazingly clever, and its power of present- 
ing ideas and situations by means of suggestion 
rather than exposition is one of its most salient 
characteristics. The opening pages afford an excel- 
lent illustration of this feature of the book, and 
others may be found in abundance. Sometimes 
the suggestiveness is of such a kind as to stir into 
vibration the deepest chords of our consciousness. 



We must illustrate our meaning by an extract, 
premising that Cathcart is a sculptor who lives in 
his own ideal world, making no concessions to the 
fashions of the hour, and that Johnnie is a simple 
youth serving his apprenticeship in the art of the 
master. 

" ' Some of us,' continued Cathcart, ' have to stick up 
a motto to remind us of — things; but it's better to 
have a live goddess. Have you ever read Dante? ' 

"Johnnie made the unnecessary statement that he 
had not. 

" ' Well, Dante wasn 't a particularly happy sort of 
chap, — a bit raw in places, and things hurt. When he 
was quite a youngster, he happened to see a little girl 
named Beatrice. Nothing came of it, you know; she 
grew up and married another fellow, — very decent 
sort, I believe. Now Dante didn *t go bleating about 
or take to drink, or anything. He happened to be a 
poet; and whatever be wrote be felt he had the eyes of 
Beatrice on him. His biggest work is all about Heaven 
and Hell, and it all leads up to Beatrice. It 'a done in 
such a way, you know, that the husband couldn 't pos- 
sibly object; in fact, be would feel proud, if he was 
anything of a sort. She died, you know, before Dante 
wrote it; but that did n't make any difference.' 

" Cathcart stared at the blank wall, and Johnnie had 
a shrewd suspicion that there were others to whom 
death did n't make any difference." 

The book has for its heroine a girl of Greek- 
English parentage, an elemental creature of earth 
and air, who embodies an ideal of simple and 
wholesome living that is almost lost to our sophisti- 
cated civilization. Such a creature is not to be 
mated by a man of modern mould, and the tragedy 
of the book is found in her union with a man of 
superficial culture, a prattler about books and music, 
who can have no real sympathy with so sane and 
natural a character as hers. We think the author 
rather evades the difficulty of his problem, when it 
is once fully presented, by disposing of his heroine 
in such summary fashion, but we can appreciate the 
difficulty of his search for a logical outcome to so 
hopeless a situation.

NOTES ON NOVELS. 



In "King's End" (Houghton), Miss Alice Brown 
proves anew her power as a literary artist, taking her 
people from a little New England village, but selecting 
men and women of real charm and wholesomeness 
instead of the aneemic personages in which other painters 
of such village life have reveled. The spirituality of 
a charming young woman is set in conflict with her love. 
A wandering evangelist has taught her that she too has 
a call to go forth and preach; but his sister, suffering 
her life through from a love unfulfilled, brings her back 
to earth and her true love again. The story is written 
with befitting simplicity, with evidences of real Yankee 
humor on almost every page, and may be commended 
to all lovers of our best native literature.

hand, Miss Maud Howard Peterson has g^ven an inter- 
national interest to " The Potter and the Clay" (Lothrop), 
which is described as " a romance of to-day." The ar- 
gument turns on the honor — in the soldier's sense — 
of one of the two British officers, the American girl's 
interest in both of them being almost equally balanced 
until one of them is proved unworthy. The manner in 
which he redeems himself in a cholera camp in India is 
well told, and the novel is much above the average in 
conception and execution. Browning's poem of " The 
Potter's Wheel " serves as a preface to the book, and 
the feeling in it is carried through the story. 

In selecting the time of Shays's Rebellion in 1786 
for the period of " The Duke of Stockbridge " (Silver, 
Burdett & Co.), the late Edward Bellamy gave himself 
an opportunity to show with what difficulty the common 
people, who fought and won the Revolutionary War, 
reconciled themselves to the government by the rich 
and self-seeking which they had been forced to over- 
throw in good part in order to secure national inde- 
pendence. None of his former books show the author 
to such good advantage in the literary sense, and the 
work has merit as successfully interpreting the feeling 
of the period it deals with. It is an interesting and 
valuable contribution to the g^wing list of worthy 
American novels. 

Mr. George Gibbs has written, and illustrated him- 
self, a novel dealing with the war between the French 
and Spanish in Florida and the vicinity, entitling it, 
"In Search of Mademoiselle" (H. T. Coates & Co.). 
It is a great advance on the sea stories for boys which 
have heretofore formed Mr. Gibbs's only contribution 
to literature, the selection of characters and time show- 
ing excellent judgment and the treatment being most 
interesting. The hero is an English youth who falls 
in love with a charming French girl of noble birth, 
whose family is devoted to the reformed religion. 
When the girl goes to the New World with others of 
her fellow-believers, the English youth is not far be- 
hind. In the story history and romance are pleasantly 
combined, and the pictures from the author's pencil are 
really interpretive and attractive. 

Comparisons are odious, and that which the publishers 
institute between Mr. F. Frankfort Moore's new book 
" Nell Gwyn — Comedian " (Brentano's) and his earlier 
" The Jessamy Bride " seems to confirm the adage. A 
pleasant and seemly work, the later novel yet lacks the 
literary charm of the earlier one, and the sweet pathos 
which attaches itaelf so readily to the memory of Gold- 
smith is almost wholly wanting in the account of the 
rollicking Nell. The story ends cheerfully, and the 
flavor throughout is that of a corrupt court and none 
too strict a stage. 

The tender romance so predominant in Mrs. Kath- 
arine Tynan Hinkson's former stories is not lacking in 
"A Daughter of the Fields" (A. C. McClurg & Co.), 
which contains an excellent portrait of a young Irish 
girl, poor and proud, who returns from an education in 
France to conditions at home which force her into the 
active management of a farm. Her landlord is young, 
and in a short time ardent. The struggle between love 
and duty, and the continual interplay of sentiment, 
make the story sweet and true. It is a pleasant con- 
tribution to our knowledge of Irish country life. 

It is interesting to learn that there are more Uni- 
tarians in Transylvania than in the United States, and 
that the title of Dr. Maurus Jokai's novel " Manasseh " 
(L. C. Page & Co.) is "Egy az Isten": One is the 



Lord, in the original. The translator from the original 
Hungarian, Mr. Percy Favor Bicknell, relates these 
facts in his frank Preface, explaining also that he has 
greatly shortened and simplified his version as compared 
with Dr. Jokai's own. What remains is nevertheless 
a well constructed story of love and war, replete with 
incident belligerent and romantic, and given added valne 
by the knowledge that there were in Europe in 1848 
men and women who were willing to shed their blood 
for that rational belief which is the finality of the Ref- 
ormation. America knows the Unitarian militant, bat 
rather as a moral than a physical force. Race distinct- 
ions between many conflicting peoples are here well 
drawn, and the work deserves a careful reading. 

Maryland is coming into its own with the colonial 
romancer — Mr. William Henry Babcock's " The Tower 
of Wye " (H. T. Coates & Co.) being the fourth or fifth 
story this year dealing with that pleasant common- 
wealth. We should like to see the one salient fact of 
the Maryland settlement, the proclamation of religions 
toleration for the first time in modem history, given 
more attention; but Mr. Babcock has chosen, instead, 
to emphasize the quarrels between the followers of 
Lord Baltimore and Secretary Claiborne. It cannot be 
doubted that his selection enables him to keep more 
closely within the limits set by convention for the co- 
lonial romance; and he has done even better in making 
the wonderfnlness of the New World, as it appeared 
to these emigrant Englishmen, one of the notes of his 
argument. 

Too much episode not strictly connected with the 
development of her plot keeps Mrs. Lacy Cleaver Mc- 
Elroy's " Juletty " (Crowell) from being the story it 
might have been made. The yoang man she introdaces 
as her hero is a deputy United States marshal on the 
lookout for manufacturers of illicit whiskey in Ken- 
tucky, the " Pennyrile " district being the scene of his 
labors. He falls in love with a pretty girl of somewhat 
lower social status than himself, and the discovery of 
the " moonshiner " and the final surrender of the maiden 
to his suit come together in the closing chapter. The 
interval is filled up with stories of the war between the 
States, with the lynching of a negro in which all the 
" best " citizens of the countryside take part, and with 
adventures of several sorts. 

Few minor characters in history lend themselves bet- 
ter to a certain sort of romance than that of John Gif- 
ford, who turned from being a cavalier officer to a 
pastorship in one of the straightest sects of his day, 
numbering Charles Stuart and John Banyan among his 
friends at the two extremes of his life. Miss Dora M. 
Jones has made a good selection in taking this remark- 
able career for elucidation in *< A Soldier of the King " 
(Cassell). John Milton figures in the story for a mo- 
ment. 

The fighting in the Netherlands between the Dnke 
of Alva and the Prince of Orange supplies the historical 
background for Miss H. C. Bailey's " My Lady of 
Orange " (Longmans), a stirring romance which pre- 
serves much of the horror of the times. There are 
eight illustrations by Miss C. P. Jacomb-Hood, which 
add to the value of the book. If one is looking for 
incessant fighting, it is to be found here. 

"The Crow's Nest" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is not a 
novel, but a rather slight descriptive narrative of a 
little garden perched high on the side of the Himalayas, 
near the city of Simla, which Mr. Kipling discovered

THE DIAL. 



[July 1, 



Cotes, the author, is better known to both American 
and English readers as Sarah Jeanette Duncan; and 
the chief value of her latest book lies in the new-world 
eyes with which she regards the rulers of the Indian 
Empire in the mountain resort which enables them to 
escape the heat of the plains, Mrs. Cotes planted in 
her " Crow's Nest " the seeds of a species of golden- 
rod that she had brought with her from America, and 
the account of the favorable reception accorded the 
new delicacy by the bees and butterflies makes inter- 
esting reading. 

It is somewhat anomalous to come upon a book which 
is almost wholly lacking in distinction so far as diction 
is concerned, yet shows from one cover to the other 
marked originality in the choice of its subject matter. 
Miss Edith WyaU's "Every One His Own Way" 
(McClure, Phillips & Co.) is made up of a series of 
instantaneous photographs of Chicago life, the subjects 
drawn largely from the points of contact between the 
older American and the newer foreign society of the 
city. Just as a kodak may grasp and bold a scene in 
which an artist finds delight, so Miss Wyatt sets down 
little episodes of more than ordinary value to literature ; 
though, as in the case of the artist and the kodak, the 
means of conveying the episode hardly rises to the 
dignity of art. There is a tendency to mere clever- 
ness, too, which needs to be subdued; yet the book is in 
many ways one to deserve attention. 

There is always danger of preciousness in the writings 
of Mr. Richard Le Gallienne, and "The Love Letters 
of the King; or, The Life Romantic" (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) is not free from this fault. It is, indeed, the 
sort of book that only a poet — a minor poet — could 
write, filled with little love lyrics in a species of vers 
libre, and flavored with a transcendental passion, a love 
of love for love's sake and not at all for the sake of the 
beloved. The moral, however, is wholesome, for the 
mild-mannered hero succeeds in divesting himself of 
the rather silly affair which fills up most of the pages 
and marrying a worthy woman. The style is rambling, 
but not incoherent. 

More than ordinary regret will be felt after reading 
" The Grapes of Wrath " (Small, Maynard & Co.) that 
the author of the book, the late Mary Harriott Norris, 
should have been taken away in what is evidently her 
intellectual and literary maturity. The story is an un- 
usually powerful one, concerning itself wholly with the 
period of the Civil War, and depicting life in a New 
Jersey village, at a Virginia country seat, among a secret 
settlement of contrabands, during the denudation of the 
Shenandoah Valley, and in Richmond just before and 
after its surrender. Apart from the broad opportunities 
thus given to interpret history, there is admirable de- 
velopment of character shown throughout the book, and 
the intricate romance element is well handled. The 
book is impressive and artistic. 

When Garcilaso de la Vega discovered that his name 
was not in " Who's Who in 1491," he set about remedy- 
ing the defect as soon as possible. As a result, after 
many years of further adventure he accumulated the 
material which Miss J. Breckenridge Ellis has now set 
forth in her "Garcilaso" (McClurg). The narrative 
is a trifle uncertain in its pronouns, running from the 
first to the third person and back with bewildering 
speed, but it is sufficiently inclusive to take in a fight 
with a Moor, a voyage with Columbus, and several other 
things of the sort. There is an admirably contrived 
love-story along with the adventure. 



A careful study of character, the hero being a Jesuit 
priest who becomes one of that gallant band of mission- 
aries which Farkman celebrates, supplies the framework 
of Miss Anna Farquhar's " The Devil's Flough " (L. C. 
Page & Co.), additional material for a background 
being drawn from the French Court of Anne of Austria 
and Mazarin. While there is enough of the sword-and- 
cloak in the book to give it interest, the soul of it lies 
deeper than mere striking incident, and the develop- 
ment of Gaston L'Artanges the roysterer, into Father 
Gaston the missionary priest, is worth following. 
Though New France figures only in the concluding 
chapter, it affords a fitting close to a story of real merit. 

Real humor, of a Stocktonish sort, runs through the 
pages of Mr. Sydney H. Preston's " The Abandoned 
Farmer " (Scribner). It is an account of a newspaper 
man, his delightfully feminine wife, and their quaint 
little son, all of whom move into the rural districts for 
the purpose of making money by not spending it. 
Everything happens at just the right time and in not 
quite the right way, but still with an ordered intelli- 
gence that sets the account of it in a world by itself. 
The contrast between the city man and the real farmer, 
the curious twist to the episodes, and the generally 
wholesomeness of Mr. Preston's work, make his book 
a welcome addition to our summer reading. 

Easily surpassing all her previous work in merit is 
Mrs. Schuyler Crowninshield's " Valencia's Garden " 
(McClure). The story is that of a little American 
maid educated in France, out of all knowledge of her 
native land, and married in a purely conventional way 
to a man old enough almost to be her grandfather, 
himself in love with a woman of his own age. Valencia 
has the most striking adventures, even though she is so 
far out of the work-a-day world in her husband's old 
French chateau as to seem cloistered. The book is 
conspicuous in an almost insistent use of the French 
language. 

A real South African novel, not connected with the 
war between Britain and the burghers, is welcome at 
this time, especially when it has nothing to do with 
racial prejudice. Such a book is to be found in " A 
Daughter of the Veldt " (Holt), by a new writer, Mr. 
Basil Marnan. From it may be derived more of the 
facts concerning the factors now at work in that distant 
land than from many veracious histories, — Kaffirs, 
Boers, and Britons appearing as they do in life, without 
exaggeration of either faults and virtues. The heroine 
is a girl reared in complete ignorance of her parents, 
though the striking prologue serves to indicate them to 
the reader. The manner in which, through her own 
sweetness and strength of character, she finally comes 
into the heritage she deserves, is excellently told, and 
the novel is a really striking one. 

Modern realism and historical romance are the two 
extremes which Mr. Louis Evan Shipman has touched 
in his former writings, and his latest volume, " The 
Curious Courtship of Kate Poins " (Appleton), arranges 
itself in the latter category. It is " a romance of the 
regency," dealing with English society in the days of 
Beau Brummell and his friend's " fat friend." Duels 
there are in plenty, and the outcome of the somewhat 
surprising wooing given the piquant heroine is made 
doubtful enough to satisfy the most ardent lover of 
suspense. Vivacity, and an exaggerated courtesy already 
old-fashioned, add to the attractiveness of the book. 

Mrs. Reginald de Koven has aspired to high things 
in her story of Artaxerxes Lougimanus, called " By the 



1901.] 



THE DIAL.

Waters of Babylon" (H. S. Stone & Co.). It is a 
tragical work with the final catastrophe omitted, a great 
deal of atmosphere whereby the luxury and ferocity of 
the day find interpretation, and an admirable plot, 
failing only in consistency through the failure to carry 
the tragedy on to a logical close. It shows great im- 
provement in method and manner over Mrs. de Koven's 
earlier book, though the style is not to be commended 
so highly as that of her translation of Pierre Loti's 
" An Iceland Fisherman." 

Mr. Payne Erskine in " When the Gates Lift up 
Their Heads " (Little, Brown, & Co.), has painted two 
characters, one of them a bright, ambitious, educated 
young gentleman, the heir to an aristocratic and wealthy 
g^ndmother, and the other a colored barber with a 
certain amount of energy but much more vanity and 
desire for show, — leaving the reader to discover at the 
close that the two, as in Mark Twain's book, were de- 
liberately exchanged soon after birth by the mother of 
the colored one. The book brings up a series of re- 
flections concerning environment which make it worthy 
of consideration, though it is rather more ambitious 
than successful when viewed as a work of art. 

The infamous treatment of American prisoners on 
board the floating prisons which England used for their 
retention during the Revolutionary War provides the 
leading episode in Mrs. Sara B. Kennedy's " Joscelyn 
Cheshire " (Doubleday, Page & Co.), her hero's escape 
from it being sufficiently exciting to make the reader 
draw a deep sigh of relief when the pursued one is 
safe at last. The heroine, by way of variation from 
the prevailing type, is not a patriot, but a rabid little 
Tory. 

The heroine who lends her name to Mr. Justin Mc- 
Carthy's " Monouia, A Love Story of 'Forty -Eight " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.) is herself named from the 
province of Munster, as that word was anciently trans- 
lated into Latin. She is a finely drawn conception, and 
her father, brother, and lover, with whom the argument 
is chiefly concerned, share that distinction with her. 
Mr. McCarthy is able to view the events of which he 
was formerly a part with the dispassionate eye of age. 

" A Novel of Modern Diplomacy," the sub-title of 
Mr. David Dwight Wells's "Parlous Times" (J. F. 
Taylor & Co.), describes the volume with accuracy. A 
man has done a wicked thing, and its results follow him 
to the bitter end; while two women, with character- 
istically uncertain motives and certain affections, serve 
to keep the catastrophe in doubt until the close. Mr. 
Wells shows strength as well as skill in the handling 
of his unusual material. 

A curious proof of the popular acceptance of Diedrieh 
Knickerbocker's veracious " History of New York from 
the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch 
Dynasty " is to be found in the " publisher's note " pre- 
fixed to Mrs. Jessie Van Zile Belden's " Antonia " 
(L. C. Page & Co.), wherein a careful explanation is 
made of the fact 'that early days in New Amsterdam 
were not lacking in the strenuous life. The novel is 
not, perhaps, the best proof of it, for, though there is 
an abundance of exciting incident, the story is told with 
a blandness which does not stir the blood. Ptwsibly it 
is the better summer story on that account. 

Through a misapprehension regarding the meaning of 
the word «' Maori," the fact that the scene of " Another 
Woman's Territory " (T. Y. Crowell & Co.) is laid in 
Australia does not become apparent for some time. New 
Zealand being the most probable spot for Maori geo- 



graphical names to obtain currency. This apart, " Alien " 
has written a story of much force, involving great ques- 
tions of honesty and intellectual integrity, dealing with 
the development of a strong man's character, and show- 
ing an insight into the feminine heart which stamps the 
author's sex. That there should be so little flavor of 
the antipodes in the book, after all, simply goes to show 
that the problems worked out in it are not those of any 
one place or time, but of universal application. 

" The Career of a Beauty " (Lippincott) is a trifle 
disappointing, for all " John Strange Winter's " author- 
ship of it. The book begins with one of those miscel- 
laneous families for which the author is famous, and 
this part is really the best of the story. When it gets 
to be a question of the war in South Africa, so seriously 
overworked by British novelists of late, with a little 
telepathy run in for variety, the story becomes less 
fascinating. 

How closely the two branches of the English-speaking 
race on the passing frontiers of America and on the 
existing frontiers of Australia run together is made 
apparent through " The Wisdom of Esau " (Cassell), 
by Messrs. C. H. Chumley and R. H. Outhwaite. The 
book is most readable, portraying as it does a bush fire 
— the antipodean equivalent of our prairie fire, — and, 
on the spiritual side, the play of almost unrestrained 
passion in a rude and pastoral civilization. It calls to 
mind the breadth of the literary field afforded by the 
continent of Australia, and how novel it all is so far as 
American readers are concerned. 

Though "A Colonial Cavalier " (Lothrop) is assuredly 
a romance of the American Revolution, its author, Mr. 
George Cary Eggleston, is a writer of too much skill 
to turn his argument upon matters of mere history. He 
provides an admirable background of fact, and his two 
young gentlemen and their two young ladies disport 
themselves before it with great vivacity and good humor. 
" Jack," one of his heroines, is a really lovable concep- 
tion. It is a pleasant story of Southern life daring 
troublous times. 

Mr. Morgan Robertson has followed his saccessfnl 
volume of sea-tales by a more ambitious and extended 
work, " Masters of Men, A Story of the New Navy " 
(Doubleday, Pag^ & Co.). Those who recall his earlier 
yarn of an officer and enlisted man in the service of the 
United States, who were " shanghaied " on one of those 
disgraces to the American flag which are known to 
sailors as " hell-ships," will find the same theme used 
for the central episode of this novel. It is as engrossing 
as any book recently written for fully two-thirds of its 
length, and it begins to lose there because of the 
imagined need of bringing girls and love into the 
argument. We think Mr. Robertson is a writer sufiB- 
ciently picturesque and graphic to tell a rattling g^ood 
story without this element of romance. 

A sensational story which serves as the frame for an 
intelligent and instructive dissertation on important 
questions of the day has been written by Mr. Frederick 
Upham Adams with the title, " The Kidnapped Million- 
aires" (Lothrop). A wealthy young New Yorker, who 
has taken up modern journalism for the fun in it, kid- 
naps the six richest men in the United States and con- 
veys them to a deserted spot which proves to be on the 
Gulf coast of Mexico. The party discuss financial and 
other topics with considerable acumen and entire free- 
dom, the views advanced being occasionally wild, but 
always intelligent. The book succeeds in conveying 
the bustle and eagerness which characterize a modem

newspaper office to a really remarkable extent, and is 
both interesting and amusing. 

No one but a poet who has lived close to the heart of 
Nature could have written such a book as " The Heart 
of the Ancient Wood " (Silver, Burdett & Co.), and 
Mr. Charles G. D. Roberts, its author, is to be con- 
gratulated for having so successfully translated the de- 
light of life in the wilds into literature. He has succeed- 
ed in doing a most difficult thing in this; and one even 
more difficult in making sympathy for the brute cre- 
ation a sufficient rival to a human suitor in a woman's 
love. 

The name of Mr. Ellis Meredith is not known to the 
reader, but his tale of a modern Robinson Crusoe, " The 
Master-Knot of Human Fate " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
deserves attention none the less on that account. It is 
the story of a man and a woman left on an island after 
a cataclysm which has submerged nearly all the world 
except that part of the Rocky Mountains on which they 
happen to be standing at the time. As Crusoe in his 
ship, so they, in a little house which survives to them, 
find the means for supporting life. The book has unusual 
merit, and the faults in it, such as that of insistent 
quotation, are abundantly criticized by the characters 
themselves. 

Mr. Joseph Sharts shows a painstaking and a literary 
grasp that deserve encouragement, in his " Ezra Caine " 
(H. S. Stone & Co.), though the book contains the 
autobiography of a maniacal murderer — as displeasing 
a subject as could well be chosen. Brief as the story 
is, it still contrives to leave the impression that if such 
a person were to write down his inmost thought this is 
surely the manner in which he would do it. Credit for 
originality belongs to Ihe author, — although the hor- 
ror essential to the narration keeps it from attaining 
any great height. 

War is always fascinating, even in its horrors; and 
it may be surmised that the war of the American Revo- 
lution, being fought for as nearly just a cause as war may 
have on this earth, is popular on both accounts. " Clay- 
ton Halowell" (R. F. Fenno & Co.), by Mr. Francis 
W. Van Praag, obtains more attention than war in its 
usual forms may command, because the plot turns so 
largely on the attempt of the hero to ferret out the 
treason which made Benedict Arnold infamous. A 
compound love-story runs through the book, with much 
plotting and counterplotting. 

Hypnotism of the most pronounced variety is the 
mystery behind "The Mysterious Burglar" (F. M. 
Buckles & Co.), and with that for the turning-point of 
his artless narrative Mr. George E. Walsh contrives to 
keep his readers in doubt through the greater part of 
the story. The account is put in the mouth of a pro- 
fessional burglar who has been taken into the service 
of the mysterious one. Something seems incongruous 
in the latter's proceedings, so the real burglar turns 
detective and eventually proves the truth of an adage 
too old to require repetition. The story holds the atten- 
tion and makes small demand on faculties likely to be 
benumbed by hot weather. 

Mr. Clinton Scollard's story of the Mohawk Valley 
during the Revolutionary campaign that led to the sur- 
render at Saratoga is called "The Son of a Tory" 
(R. G. Badger & Co.), and has rare merit among books 
of its kind. Its characters are alive, and bear a close 
resemblance to the men and women we know to-day. 
Nearly every historical romance read in late years em- 
phasizes the differences between the people of its day 



and those of ours; Mr. Scollard has preferred, rather, 
to lay stress upon the likenesses. Apart from the inter- 
esting episodes which follow the history of that time 
with substantial accuracy, this choice of treatment gives 
the book real distinction. Nothing has ever been gained 
by setting Revolutionary characters and Revolutionary 
times off by themselves; much is to be gained by bring- 
ing them together. Our ancestors were men and women 
of like passions with ourselves; and we can be grateful 
to the author for having shown them exactly as they 
were. 

Mr. Clive Holland's " Mousm^ " (Stokes) has the 
good fortune to appear as the sequel to an earlier suc- 
cess, " My Japanese Wife." The history of the little 
geisha girl is carried on from the time of her wedding, 
through a journey to England, and an enforced return 
to Japan due to the difficulties of the British climate. 
Mr. Holland's book is an excellent antidote to M. Pierre 
Loti's " Mme. Chrysanth^me," being filled with bright 
humor and real sentiment. 

The loss of the " Essex " in Valparaiso, on March 28, 
1814, is the crowning episode of Mr. T. J. Hains's sea- 
story, " The Cruise of the Petrel " (McClure, Phillips 
& Co.). The author has left the " love interest " where 
it belongs in a good sea-story — entirely out of it. A 
pair of villains of the good old sort, and a cheerful 
suggestion of piracy, make the book undeniably inter- 
esting. 

Whatever the work of Mr. Guy Boothby may lack 
in other respects, it is always ingenious. In " The 
Mystery of the Clasped Hands " (Appleton) a wealthy 
English painter is sent a box containing the severed 
hands of a former model of his by way of wedding 
present, and it takes a modern M. Dupin to unravel the 
problem of the sender. He is discovered, of course, 
after the usual process. The book is of the lightest 
sort. 

Mr. W. O. Stoddard is not as successful with " Mon- 
tayne, or, The Slavers of Old New York" (Altemus) 
as with his stories for boys, chiefly because he uses 
much the same plan of construction and gives incident 
too high a place. The book, indeed, has enough action 
in it for three stories, and something like bewilder- 
ment follows the reader in trying to keep pace with it 
all. 

" David Harum " is presumably responsible for 
"John Winslow" (Dillingham), a mild reflection of 
the earlier dialect story of homely village worth. The 
author, Mr. Henry D. Northrop, has discovered a 
worthy character in this later hero, and his story is well 
told. 

After wandering in the slough of Mexican politics 
through a thick volume, Mr. Charles Fleming Embree 
returns to the better and more distinctive manner of 
his first book of stories in " A Heart of Flame " (Bowen- 
Merrill) . The story is a passionate one of the Mexican 
frontier, — priests, people, a sheriff's posse, and an ex- 
ecution figuring in its pages, beside the strikingly con- 
ceived figure of the heroine, Ramoncita. The story has 
the merit of being inevitable, the scenes of blood and 
lawlessness being supported by the environment in the 
most essential manner. 

Mr. Edwin Asa Dix has written of New England 
village life most acceptably in "Old Bowen's Legacy" 
(The Century Co.). The action turns upon the bequest 
of an eccentric person, and the types which the author 
draws of the various people who are involved in the 
final award are clear and distinct.

The Bilioustine 

Every copy tied with a string by hand. 
Brown paper ; 24 pages ; price, 25 cts. 

♦• A TIMELY AND MERITED SATIRE." 

" As a well-aimed shaft of ridicule there is nothing to equal it. As 
a piece of humor it is a gem." — Denver Republican. 

" The Fra Maginnis of ' The Bilioustine ' proves to be a more enter- 
taining character than the original Fra, while his writings are much 
cleverer and contain a great deal more common sense than those of his 
model. Not only is ' The Bilioustine ' a faithful copy of the original 
pamphlet both in style and appearance, but in many cases the imitation 
is an improvement upon the original." — Chicago Journal. 

" No reader can afford to be without a copy of ' The Bilioustine.' " 
—Chicago Pott. 

" There is humor in every sentence of the satire. "-S<. Louis Republic. 

"One of the best parodies perpetrated in the last twenty years." 
— St. Louis Mirror. 

All book-stores and news-stands should have it, or address 

WILLIAM S. LORD, Publisher, Evanston, III. 



Alfred the Great 



"This year is the millenial of the death of King Alfred, 
* who has been called " the most perfect character in 
history." He was a great scholar, as well as a great 
ruler, and two Old South Leaflets have just been pub- 
lished to illustrate his historical work —

The Recognition of a Remarkable Book 

A History of the American People 

By FRANCIS NEWTON THORPE, Ph.D., 

Author of " A Constitutional History of the American People," " The Constitutional 

History of the United States," etc., etc. 

With Maps and Index, 12mo, 627 pages, $1.50 net. 

A One-Volume History of Our Country, which should be at once comprehensive, 
scholarly, readable, and exact, has long been a real need of the teacher, the student, 
and the general reader. A work giving within the compass of a single volume the salient 

facts in the wonderful development of this great nation — 
a work which could be depended upon as a reference- 
book, which could be trusted as to the fairness of its 
treatment of the great questions which have arisen in our 
history, which should eliminate the unessential and present 
only the vital, which should be withal and above all in- 
teresting and entertaining, — such a work could only be 
attempted by a scholar thoroughly equipped for his task 
by years of preparation. Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe, 
historical student, lecturer, and author, has long been a 
recognized authority in the field of American constitutional 
and political history, and when some years ago this ac- 
complished man planned and began a one-volume history 
of the American people, there could be little doubt that he 
would consummate his work successfully and satisfactorily. 
That he has done so is now abundantly proved by the recep- 
tion given by the press to " A History of the American People." Published but six 
weeks, the book has been noticed by the leading papers with uniform praise and commendation. 



From Boston Journal, July j : 

"It is a vast and puzzling task to 
tell in six hundred pages the whole 
story of the development of a mighty 
nation, but the reader of Professor 
Thorpe's volume wonders how it 
could be better done. . . . The ag- 
gregate amount of the information 
which he compresses into this one 
book is astonishing. Nothing of real 
dignity and value seems to have been 
overlooked. . . . For the general 
library, and especially for the student 
in need of quick reference and verifi- 
cation, it is invaluable. The index 
is especially full."

An American Novel Generously Received in England 

THE CRISIS 

By Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL 

NOTHING was more natural than that the American public and the American reviews 
should speak well of, even praise to the point of extravagance, Mr. Churchill's new 
novel, " THE CRISIS." That was to be expected. The story is most interesting, the 
love tale fascinating, and as a picture of the Civil War and its heroes the book has never 
been equalled, even approached. But with the cooler criticism of the English papers 
comes, we are glad to say, the best praise of the work. 

The London Academy says in regard to " The Crisis " that Mr. Winston Churchill has not gone back. 
He will not be among those authors who achieve fame in a month, only to lose it again in a few years. He 
will always be a dignified and impressive figure in American letters, and his books will always have an 
immense sale. 

The London Spectator again praises the book highly, and says: "We do not grudge Mr. Churchill his 
popularity, but rather welcome it as an excellent sign of the times. For he has given us an exceedingly 
spirited, interesting, and right-minded romance of the Civil War, in which, while generously appreciative 
of the chivalry, the heroism, and the charm of the Southerners, always, from the dramatic and literary 
point of view, far more picturesque and engaging subjects than the Yankees, he never falters a moment in 
his enthusiasm for the North. The true hero is Lincoln, and we have to thank Mr. Churchill for a very 
honest portrait of that great man, and a most graphic account of the manner in which he conquered the 
admiration of the fastidious." 

In addition to these words of praise from our English friends, we cannot refrain from 
quoting from a review from nearer home, which has just reached us : 

Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie, in The Outlook^ says of it: "The most important of all is Mr. Winston 
Churchill's * The Crisis,' which must rank among the foremost books of the year. No more realistic and 
sympathetic study of Mr. Lincoln has been made than that which is presented in this book, and the figure 
grows upon the reader as he passes from chapter to chapter. The interest in Mr. Lincoln's rare personality 
steadily deepens as one perceives underneath his homeliness the elements of power and the nobility of his 
character. No finer interpretation of Mr. Lincoln's spirit has ever been made than that which Mr. Churchill 
makes in the few words he puts into Lincoln's mouth in his interview with Virginia Carvel. It has ele- 
ments of originality and power, and is, above all, profoundly interesting. It possesses the great quality of 
interpreting American life from an intelligent American point of view — a process very much rarer than 
most people think."

JOH N FI SKE. 

American scholarship soffers a serious loss 
in the death of John Fiske, early in the pres- 
ent month, at the age of fifty-nine. Uis health 
had always been so robust, and his vitality 
was so seemingly inexhaustible, that the news 
of his sudden taking-off came to us with a 
shock, although an observer skilled in the lore 
of physiology might possibly have seen in the 
very massiveness of that frame, with its extra- 
ordinary capacities for the consumption of 
meat and drink, as well as for the exercise of 
both physical and intellectual activities, the 
sign of a development so abnormal that its 
powers of resistance must be weakened some- 
where, and would be in danger of giving way 
to some unusual strain. The strain came with 
the torrid heat that spread like a blanket over 
this country early in the present summer, and 
marked among its thousands of victims the 
distinguished historian and philosopher whose 
task is now completed. 

The leading facts in the life of John Fiske 
may be stated in a few words. He was bom 
in Connecticut in 1842. His true name was 
Edmund Fiske Green, which he changed in 
boyhood to that of a grandfather with whom he 
went to live, thus acquiring the name by which 
he is known to the world. He was a child of 
extraordinary precocity, at the age of ten or 
twelve mastering subjects that are usuaUy re- 
served for the later stages of the education of 
young men. In this respect, his life suggests 
that of Cotton Mather or of John Stuart Mill, 
and the stories told of the tender years of those 
worthies may all be matched in the records of 
John Fiske's childhood. He went through 
Harvard College mainly as a matter of form, 
and remained in that institution after gradu- 
ation as instructor and as an assistant in the 
library. When about thirty years of age he 
became a professional scholar and man of let- 
ters almost to the exclusion of any other oc- 
cupation, although he continued to lecture, at 
intervals, for the rest of his life. During these 
years, he made his home in Cambridge, al- 
though he travelled considerably, both in this 
country and in Europe. Such are the modest 
annals of this life of devotion to the things of 



48 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



the mind ; what remains to be said of the man 
who lived it must relate chiefly to his ideas 
and the books in which they were expressed. 

Philosophy and history were the major pre- 
occupations of Mr. Fiske during his working 
years, and nearly all of his writings belong to 
the one or the other of these subjects, although 
now and then a book may be said to do hardly 
more than touch the fringes of either history 
or philosophy. This is true, for example, of 
the little book called " Tobacco and Alcohol," 
a spirited polemic directed against James 
Parton's " Smoking and Drinking," which 
latter work was a most intemperate exposition 
of the ideas commonly misassociated with the 
name of temperance. It is also true of the 
volumes that are made up of miscellaneous 
matter, for many of the essays here included 
represent the author's diversions rather than 
his serious pursuits. We are glad that he had 
diversions, for we owe to them much stimu- 
lating entertainment, such, for instance, as is 
provided by that brilliant study, published 
within the last few years, of the Shaconian 
delusion and its victims. 

Of Mr. Fiske's two subjects, philosophy 
came first. He was a very young man when 
he made a visit to England, became acquainted 
with Darwin, Huxley, and Mr. Herbert 
Spencer, and returned home, his brain seething 
with the new evolutionary thought. Of this 
thought he became the leading American ex- 
ponent, and his " Outlines of Cosmic Philos- 
ophy," published in 1874, was a restatement 
of the Spencerian system that seemed to many 
readers an improvement upon the original, so 
greatly did Mr. Spencer's ideas benefit by the 
lucidity and literary art of his American dis- 
ciple. This work was supplemented in a way, 
some years later, by two small volumes en- 
titled " The Destiny of Man " and " The Idea 
of God." These proved to be the most widely 
popular of Mr. Fiske's writings, but his best 
friends, and those having the most intimate 
acquaintance with his thought, looked upon 
them as not altogether worthy of their author. 
In their attempt to reconcile the teachings of 
science with religious dogma these books, when 
carefully examined, seem flavored with soph- 
istry, and lend a sort of countenance to beliefs 
that are fundamentally inconsistent with the 
evolutionary doctrine. In a word, they pro- 
duce the impression of a writer who is not 
quite honest with himself, and is willing to 
make an intellectual compromise with a system 
of ideas that he is, as it were, under bonds to 



oppose. Even Mr. Spencer felt called upon 
to protest against some of the religious impli- 
cations that his follower sought to fasten upon 
the synthetic philosophy. 

Nearly twenty years ago, Mr. Fiske turned 
his attention from philosophy to American 
history, and nearly all of his subsequent work 
was done in the latter field. Political philos- 
ophy served him as a bridge for this transition, 
and his book on " American Political Ideas " 
marked the turning-point in his career. He 
remained to the end essentially a philosophical 
historian rather than a historian of manners, 
or even of wars, and the drum and trumpet 
ideal was kept as far as possible out of his 
work. A masterly treatment of " The Critical 
Period of American History " was the first of 
the series of works which, although they seemed 
detached studies for a time, were gradually 
seen to take their places in what was to prove 
a systematic survey of our national records. 
" The Beginnings of New England " and " The 
American Revolution " soon followed, and the 
author's design assumed solidity and continuity* 
Then came " The Discovery of America," 
dealing with the whole period of exploration 
and determination of the coast-line of the New 
World. After this, the order of production 
became more logical, for the next works were 
" Virginia and Her Neighbors " and " The 
Dutch and Quaker Colonies." Here the record 
ends, except for a detached study of a part o£ 
the Civil War period, and a number of ad- 
mirable books for schools and young people. 
Taken as a whole, Mr. Fiske's work in Ameri- 
can history gives us a fairly complete treatment 
of the subject from the time of the discoverers 
down to the adoption of the Constitution. It 
is brilliant work, fine in its literary quality, 
and remarkable for its judicial tone and its 
power to deal with conflicting opinions, deter- 
mining upon which side lies the weight of the 
evidence. It is work that fairly places the 
author among our great historians, in the group 
that includes Prescott and Motley, Bancroft 
and Parkman, Mr. Henry Adams and Mr. 
James Ford Rhodes. 

The chief impression that is left upon the 
mind of one acquainted with Mr, Fiske's work 
in its entirety is that of a thoroughly sane 
and well-balanced intellect. There are so many 
instances of men who are clear-headed in the 
work that engages their best activities, yet 
who betray weakness in some other direction, 
that it is refreshing to come in contact with a 
mind which seems to have had no serious in-

tellectual infirmity. The best of men are sub- 
ject to occasional vagaries, and one could make 
up a long list of able thinkers who have " a 
screw loose " somewhere, in whose mental 
armor there is some weak point. The vulner- 
able spot may be reached by spiritualism, or 
the single tax, or palmistry, or telepathy, or 
the delusions of " Christian science " and the 
Baconian authorship of Shakespeare's plays. 
From such vagaries of the intellect John Fiske 
seems to have been absolutely free. His scien- 
tific and philosophical training was so compre- 
hensive, his sense of the value of evidence was 
so sure, his insight into all the methods of 
fraud and pretense was so unerring, that no 
form of pseudo-science could get a lodgment 
in his brain. He seems- to have taken the 
right view of every subject to which he gave 
his attention, the view, that is, which is sup- 
ported by the consensus of intelligent opinion 
among those who speak with authority. We 
cannot call him an original thinker — which 
might be doubtful praise, if we could, — but 
we can say of him that he has had few equals 
in penetrative grasp and understanding of the 
more serious problems of modern science, his- 
tory, and philosophy. 



LIBRARY COOP ERATION. 

The American Library Association has just held 
its twenty-third general meeting, at "Waukesha, 
Wisconsin. At the first meeting of the association, 
in 1876, attention was directed to the possibilities 
of cooperation among librarians for the attainment 
of worthy ends not to be secured by individuals 
working singly. The early volumes of the " Library 
Journal " contain frequent contributions on this 
topic. In fact, the question has been always with 
the association. 

This principle of cooperation was applied to in- 
dexing, and Poole's Index to Periodical Literature, 
with its multiple supplements, and the A. L. A. 
Index to General Literature, resulted. Its appli- 
cation to reciprocal relations between libraries led 
to inter-library loans. Now the professor in an 
isolated Kansas college may pursue his own ad- 
vanced studies, because through his library he may 
borrow books from Harvard University Library. 
Another phase of the larger library's work for the 
smaller is seen in the many-sided developments of 
the travelling library idea as carried out by state 
libraries and library commissions. Prior to 1901, 
seventeen states had made provision for the aiding 
of very small libraries and of communities with no 
libraries by the formation of state library commis- 
sions. The lessening of administrative expenses by 



printing and distributing catalogue cards to libraries 
through some central bureau was recognized as a 
desideratum at the outset. But obstacles were met 
in the varying sizes of cards used by libraries, and 
in difficulties of selection and distribution. Valu- 
able annotated bibliographies of selected titles on 
various subjects have been possible only through 
cooperation and the generous financial support of 
such friends of libraries as Mr. George lies of New 
York City. The bibliography of American history 
is now half through the press. 

A factor destined to be powerful in many future 
cooperative undertakings for libraries came to the 
front at this conference — the Library of Congress. 
Its coming was greeted with the enthusiasm its 
importance demands. At the public meeting of 
the association the chief address was by the Libra- 
rian of Congress, Mr. Herbert Putnam, on " What 
may be done for Libraries by the Nation." He 
defined his subject as what the nation as a unit 
acting through its central authority may do. He 
said, in brief : 

" Only as assamed by a central aathority are some ander- 
takings possible. The federal ^Yemment is already aiding 
libraries in varied ways. It encoarag:es the mannfactore of 
good books, it exempts from duty foreign books for libraries, 
it establishes bnreans of scientific research, it is the largest 
pablisher in the world, it uses a million poands of paper stock 
a year and dlstribates over three hundred thousand of its own 
issues, it has a clearing-house for duplicate United States 
documents, it is indexing its own publications, it maintains a 
bureau in the interest of educational institutions, and this 
bureau has brought out several valuable library publications. 
The government maintains its own great libraries ; for exam- 
ple, that of the Surgeon-General's Office, whose elaborate 
catalogue has already cost more than $250,000. 

" But goyemment activities in behalf of libraries naturally 
centre in the Library of Congress. This was created as a 
legislative library, but it is now referred to as something more. 
Its building was paid for by the country at large, it is often 
alluded to as the national library of the United States, and 
such it may become. Its conditions difEer from those of the 
British Museum. There a student need not go over five hun- 
dred miles to reach his national library, here he may have to 
go three thousand miles. It should serve students in Wash- 
ington, it ought also to provide for scholars in the country at 
large by loaning books to them and by employing specialists 
to answer questions sent to Washington. To meet their needs, 
it should accumulate original sources, works of importance for 
occasional reference, the useless books that libraries in g:en- 
eral cannot afford space for, and the general mass of books. 
All this involves the costly processes of cataloguing and classi- 
fication. Cooperative undertakings should have headquarters 
in Washington. The Library of Cong^ress may provide a na- 
tional clearing-house for miscellaneous duplicates. Toward 
these things we are drifting. We have the building, the 
equipment, the books. The library contains seven hundred 
thousand volumes, and five hundred thousand other items. 
Its resources are not omnipotent but they are comprehensive. 
It is strong in Americana, political and social science, juris- 
prudence, learned societies and serials in general. As far as 
deliberate purchase is concerned two extremes are to be ab- 
stained from, books merely poptdar and those merely ctirious. 
Books are to be bought that will aid in the establishment of 
fact. The library has the org^anization, having now a staff of 
261 persons, not including caretakers, printers, or binders. 
It has a division of bibliography, a bindery, and a printing 
office. But it has also a large arrear of work, including the 
classification and shelf-list, and the author and subject cata- 
logues. A library of reference books for Congress should be 
arranged, and the other libraries of the District of Columbia

should be coordinated with the Library of Congress, and it 
should have a catalogue of all these libraries. In some re- 
spects the equipment is inadequate for these larger under- 
takings. Its authorities should consider what may be done 
in the distribution of printed cards to general libraries. It 
may become the bibliographic bureau of the United States 
and issue publications. If it is to be the national library, it 
should loan books to other libraries, serving the scholar 
through the local library," 

No greater boon could come to American libraries 
than the realization of the plans projected by Mr. 
Putnam for the development of the national library, 
and outlined in the foregoing brief synopsis. This 
library is the natural centre for all great biblio- 
graphical undertakings in this country, and the 
natural point of contact with international enter- 
prises. During the conference, an agreement was 
reached between Mr. Putnam and the publishing 
board of the American Library Association, and as 
a result the Library of Congress is to furnish its 
printed cards for distribution to other libraries. 
The details of the plan are still to be worked out, 
but it will certainly be of the greatest benefit to the 
libraries of this country. It means reduced expense 
and drudgery, and increased inspiration as a con- 
sequence. One of the older librarians even said 
that he could now depart in peace for he had seen 
cooperative printed cards established at the national 
library. 

Undoubtedly the general public cares very little 
about the details of library cataloguing and classi- 
fication. If it gets prompt service, it asks no 
questions. But it must be a matter of deep interest 
to scholars to see the librarians giving an increasing 
amount of attention to the expert bibliographical 
side of library matters. This tendency was very 
marked at this meeting. Two long sessions of one 
section were devoted to details of certain modifica- 
tions in cataloguing rules, the standpoint of the 
libraries for scholars being chiefly considered. Still 
another session was occupied with bibliography in 
its strict sense. Another indication of the same 
trend is the organization within two years of the 
Bibliographical Society of Chicago. This society 
held an informal meeting at Waukesha, many of 
the non-resident members being present. The spirit 
there manifested will probably develop this into a 
national society in a few years. The full and fre- 
quent consideration of the problems of the small 
public library, with its abbreviated catalogue of 
books chiefly American, has been a necessity. The 
stress laid upon the books for children, and on 
children's rooms, is as it should be. But the lack 
of the scholarly element in American library affairs 
has been unfavorably commented on abroad, even 
while the American success in practical library 
technique was freely admitted. This new emphasis 
on the scholarly side of librarianship is a welcome 
development. 

A period of library expansion is evidently at 
hand. The gifts to libraries from June 1, 1900, 
to July 1, 1901, include 405 separate gifts, amount- 
ing to $16,130,220.12 ; and of these gifts, 394 are 



for libraries in the United States. The chief donor 
to libraries is Mr. Andrew Carnegie, his benefac- 
tions amounting in this year to more than eleven 
millions. With princely gifts to libraries, with 
Dr. John S. Billings as the new president of the 
American Library Association, with cooperative 
cataloguing established on a basis never before 
possible, with scholarship receiving increasing rec- 
ognition in library affairs, the outlook for American 
libraries is heartening in the highest degree.

COMMUNICA TION. 



DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF PHILANTHROPY, 
( To the Editor of The Dial. ) 

I agree fully with what The Dial has to say about 
" Prescient Philanthropy," in a recent issue. The fact 
that so many men of great wealth are directing a 
large portion of their fortunes into educational channels 
is indeed a cause for great satisfaction. Donations of 
this character form the nucleus of enduring monuments, 
and surpass, as it seems to me, gifts extending into any 
other field of human endeavor, however worthy in the 
abstract, in the intrinsic good that follows to the human 
race, 

I wish it were possible, however, — and this is my 
excuse for this communication, — to induce some of 
these liberal givers to make a more democratic distri- 
bution of their gifts ; to give, for instance, to such edu- 
cational objects and movements as will directly and 
immediately enhance the knowledge and the desire for 
knowledge of the common people. Here is, if you please, 
a comparatively un worked field ah initio. Here the 
opportunities for wise and judicious giving are simply 
inexhaustible. 

Let me particularize. What school district would 
decline a gift of a few hundred dollars, and meet the 
gift with a similar amount, for the purpose of establish- 
ing and maintaining a school district library ? How 
many of country schools, where the rudiments only are 
taught, have such libraries ? What municipality would 
decline a gift of a few thousand dollars for the purpose 
of establishing a public library and free reading-room, 
and would refuse to meet the gift with a similar ap- 
propriation from its own funds ? How many of the 
municipalities containing a population of, say, under 
five thousand persons, have such institutions ? The 
establishing of industrial schools in central locations, 
geographically and with reference to transportation 
facilities, and providing this education free to the 
worthy poor children of the locality, — including free 
text-books, free apparatus, free clothing if necessary, 
and free tuition, — offers a large field for public-spirited 
and liberal-minded citizens. 

These are but a few of the " opportunities " which 
the educational field presents. The number could be 
increased a hundred-fold. In a true democracy, like 
our own, is not large giving, in the manner indicated 
herein, more in keeping with the spirit of our institu- 
tions ? Does it not tend to advance the general welfare ? 
Is not the effect to promote the common weal ?

The Ixner IjTfe of the American 
Colonies.* 



The most difficult thing in writing and 
teaching history is to reproduce in imagination 
the " mental furniture " of a past age. It is 
easy to describe its houses and ships, its chairs, 
tables, and candlesticks, and the written de- 
scription may be supplemented by pictorial 
illustration. We can easily understand that 
railroads, telegraphs, and newspapers were 
wanting, and that their absence altered the 
external conditions of life. But we naturally 
think of the intellectual outfit of the people as 
differing but slightly from that of our own 
time. It is difficult to divest ourselves of the 
abstract ideas which we have imbibed from 
infancy, and to realize that they formed no 
part of the common stock of knowledge of the 
past. Still more difficult is it to substitute for 
these ideas the superstitions and delusions 
which men held in their stead. Our projection 
backward into the inner life of the period of 
American colonization is the task which Dr. 
Eggleston has set for himself in his " Transit 
of Civilization from England to America in the 
Seventeenth Century." " Eclipses, parhelia, 
comets were danger signals hung out in the 
heavens as warnings. Logic was the only im- 
plement for the discovery of truth. Observa- 
tion was in its birth-throes. Medicines were 
recognized by signaturism. . . . Right and 
wrong were thought of only as the result of 
direct revelation. . . . Unless we understand 
these things," he says, " we write the history 
of the seventeenth century in vain." The book 
continues " The Beginners of a Nation," pub- 
lished several years ago, and forms the second 
volume in the author's projected " History of 
Life in the United States." 

Dr. Eggleston divides his descriptive cata- 
logue of early colonial ideas into six chapters. 
The first sets forth seventeenth-century ideas 
of common things : the belief in astrology and 
the Ptolemaic system, the dread of comets and 
other portents, the notions of animal life and 
its generation by putrefaction, the marvellous 
tales that were believed about unicorns and 
basilisks, and the supposed control of human 
affairs by angels and witches. The second 

* The Transit of CrvTUZATiON from England to America 
in the Seventeenth Centory. By Edward Eggleston. New 
York : D. Appleton & Co. 



chapter treats of the medical notions of the 
period of settlement. Galen's theory of humors 
and the doctrine of signaturism remained the 
basis of medical practice, and Harvey's discov- 
ery scarcely found acceptance in the colonies 
during the whole of the seventeenth century. 
The medical remedies are described in detail: 
black powder of calcined toads, theriac of 
snake's flesh, and other nauseous drinks and 
compounds derived from unspeakable sources. 
Of them all, the curious weapon-ointment, ap- 
plied to a weapon producing a wound instead 
of to the wound itself, and the sympathetic 
powder with which blood from the wound was 
treated, must have been the best because least 
harmful. Some competent physicians came 
over with the first settlers, but subsequently 
medical practice degenerated and medical 
knowledge declined. The third chapter treats 
of the adjustment of the English speech of the 
seventeenth century to colonial surroundings, 
of the application of old names to new things, 
the adoption of Indian terms, the development 
of local dialects and the beginnings of colonial 
literature. Of English writers of the Eliza- 
bethan period, the colonists knew little or 
nothing. Shakespeare, Dr. Eggleston says, 
" was never mentioned by any American writer 
of the seventeenth century." Under the title 
" Weights and Measures of Conduct," the 
fourth chapter deals with social and religious 
ideas — the reverence for rank, the supremacy 
of the church, the severity of the New England 
Sabbath, the monstrous ideas of God, the 
heartless damnation of infants, and the literal 
application of scriptural texts to the affairs of 
every-day life. The fifth chapter, called " The 
Tradition of Education," begins with a digres- 
sion on the origin of English schools, and then 
gives an account of their transfer to America, 
the beginnings of common schools, the outward 
traits of school life, and the founding of the 
colleges. The last chapter describes communal 
holdings and other forms of land tenure, the 
character and status of indentured servants, 
and the beginnings of African slavery. The 
life portrayed is that of Virginia, Maryland, 
and the New England colonies, the other col- 
onies being reserved for a later volume. The 
work throughout is based upon original sources, 
and a great deal of interesting and valuable 
material is presented. 

A few points suggest comment. Dr. Eggle- 
ston bases the common dislike of a census upon 
the disasters that followed David's experiment. 



62 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



We are rather disposed to think that David's 
example was used to bolster up an inherited 
aversion which antedated popular knowledge 
of the Scriptures, and in its origin was based 
upon the fear that an enumeration of the popu- 
lation was the prelude of further taxation. He 
derives the famous Massachusetts school law 
of 1647 from the rule laid down in 1560 in 
Knox's " Book of Discipline " and its adoption 
in 1618 by the Synod of Dort, although he 
admits in a note that " the general responsi- 
bility of a corporate town as such for its school, 
where there was one, was a trait of English 
life." It was but a step further to require that 
the town should have a school. The connection 
with Knox's precept may have existed ; but in 
the absence of proof that it did, it seems more 
natural to suppose that the Massachusetts act 
was a development, growing out of local needs, 
of the English precedent. Dr. Eggleston gives 
without comment the usual account of the in- 
troduction of slavery into Virginia by the 
Dutch. Inasmuch as the reliability of the 
account has been questioned and an earlier im- 
portation claimed, we would have expected a 
fuller discussion of the point. 

Taking the book as a whole, Dr. Eggleston 
does not seem to us to have succeeded in his 
purpose of presenting a clear-cut picture of the 
mental outfit of the early American colonists. 
This is due in part to the inherent difficulty 
of the task, but also in part to certain faults 
of arrangement and exposition. The machinery 
of text, marginal references, and supplementary 
notes or " elucidations," is too complicated for 
a popular history and unduly divides the at- 
tention. A clearer impression would have 
resulted if part of the " elucidations " had been 
incorporated in the text and the remainder 
compressed into ordinary foot-notes. The text 
reads more like a transcript from an historical 
note-book than like a digested whole. It often 
jumps abruptly from one subject to another. 
At points it runs into digressions interesting 
in themselves but not very closely connected 
with the principal subject. At other points 
it omits important explanations which are es- 
sential to a clear understanding of the matter 
presented. In fact. Dr. Eggleston has so fully 
entered into the point of view of the earlier 
generation that he has to some extent lost sight 
of the mental outfit of the present one. Al- 
though compelled to make this qualification, 
we would not, however, have it obscure the 
many merits of the work.

Romance of an Unhappy Queen.* 

Unless we would dispute Lord Chesterfield's 
time-honored dictum that whatever is worth 
doing at all is worth doing well, we cannot 
withhold our praise from Mr. Wilkins's life 
of Sophia Dorothea, to whom he has deemed 
it worth while to devote a volume of nearly six 
hundred octavo pages. This painstaking record 
of court gossip and petty intrigue, unedifying 
though it is in many respects, yet serves to 
teach anew the lesson of Broome's familiar 
lines : 

" None are completely wretched but the great. 

Superior woes, superior stations bring ; 

A peasant sleeps, while cares awake a king." 

The story of this unfortunate princess has 
been so many times told, and is so well known 
to every reader of Thackeray, of Doran, and 
of Macaulay, that it is unnecessary here to 
retrace it even in outline. She has been judged 
with every degree of harshness and of lenity, 
although the weight of opinion is decidedly 
against her. The common verdict is probably 
that pronounced by Thackeray, that she was 
"the bad wife of a bad husband," and that 
she carried on a criminal intrigue with a man 
" than whom a greater scamp does not walk 
the history of the seventeenth century." But 
when we remember who her husband was, — 
the first of the Georges, a man who, to quote 
Macaulay's characterization, " could not read 
a line of Pope, and who loved nothing but 
punch and fat women," — we are more than 
half inclined to take Doran's more favorable 
view of her conduct. In the matter of censure 
he contents himself with saying : " Sophia 
atoned for some possible indiscretion by a long 
captivity, the severity of which tended only to 
the purifying of her character." 

Between these extremes Mr. Wilkins, with 
much new material at his command, steers a 
middle course. Hidden away in the library 
of the University of Lund, as we are told in 
his preface, he discovered the long-lost corre- 
spondence between Sophia Dorothea and Count 
Konigsmarck — or, at least, so much of it as 
has escaped destruction. Other original docu- 
ments, in the Hanoverian archives and in the 
State Paper Office in London, have been used 
by him for the first time. He has followed up 
these researches by visits to Celle, to Hanover,

and to Ahlden, the scenes respectively of the 
princess' youth, married life, and imprison- 
ment ; and now he would seem to have said 
the last word on the unhappy career of the 
" uncrowned queen." 

Although as a rule he is very conscientious 
in citing his authorities, he occasionally has 
the air of embellishing his very readable nar- 
rative for the sake of effect. The reader would 
like to know, for example, whence he derives 
his minute account of Konigsmarck's murder, 
an account differing in several details from the 
commonly accepted one, — or, at least, ampli- 
fying it in a number of particulars. The 
sixteenth chapter opens with a statement at 
variance not only with previous histories of 
Sophia Dorothea's life, but also with the 
writer's own subsequent narrative. He tells 
us that for more than a year after her divorce 
the princess was detained in Hanoverian terri- 
tory, before being removed to Ahlden, in the 
domains of her father, the Duke of Celle. 
But, according to the author's own account, 
the decree of divorce was issued December 28, 
1694, and the divorced wife left Lauenau for 
Ahlden on the 28th of the following February. 

Such occasional slips, however, are pardon- 
able ; less so, perhaps, are certain other errors, 
attributable either to the printer or to the 
proof-reader, or, in too many instances, to the 
author himself. Drinking is spoken of as " a 
very venal offence in those days." " The effort 
it cost her to have made the visit " and " it would 
have been worse for her to have dissembled " 
offend the lover of careful English. The sons 
of Duke Ernest Augustus are described as 
quarrelling and fighting until " Hanover be- 
came a beer-garden." Count Carl Kbnigs- 
marck begins his travels when " quite a boy." 
" Mutual " is made to do duty for " common," 
and " anticipate " for " expect "; the split in- 
finitive (a minor offender) is used ; the retained 
object with a passive verb (another lesser delin- 
quent) obtrudes itself unnecessarily ; " whether 
we will or no " stares us in the face ; and, 
worst of all, we read of a certain attorney that 
he " was by way of being a conscientious man." 
In a word, admirably though Mr. Wilkins tells 
his story, he seems occasionally to go out of 
his way to show how the King's English should 
not be written. 

The tone of the secret correspondence be- 
tween Sophia Dorothea and her lover Konigs- 
marck may be inferred from what the author 
says in regard to the letters of the princess: 
" Believing that she was writing to him alone, 



she pours forth her soul in absolute abandon- 
ment. She gives herself to him so completely, 
so unreservedly, and withal so intimately, that 
one almost shrinks from laying bare this con- 
fession of woman's love for man." 

Many readers will wish that he had quite 
shrunk from laying bare so much as is disclosed 
in the two hundred or more pages of amatory 
outpourings. The dose is too strong and too 
copious to suit some tastes. But — not to 
end this review with carping criticism on a 
work that has afforded the reviewer several 
hours of pleasant reading — the book gives a 
vivid picture of the period and the country 
with which it deals, and is written with the pen 
of a conscientious historian. The new matter 
discovered and so ably used by the author 
helps to a better understanding of a too little 
understood character, and most readers will 
close the volume with gentler feelings for the 
unhappy woman whose pathetic story it tells.

The Evolution of Negro LiEAdership.* 

In every generation of oar national life, from 
Phillis Wheatley to Booker Washington, the Neg^o 
race in America has sacceeded in bringing forth 
men whom the country, at times spontaneously, at 
times in spite of itself, has been impelled to honor 
and respect. Mr. Washington is one of the most 
striking of these cases, and his autobiography is a 
partial history of the steps which made him a gronp 
leader, and the one man who in the eyes of the 
nation typifies at present more nearly than all 
others the work and worth of his nine million 
fellows. 

The way in which groups of human beings are 
led to choose certain of their number as their 
spokesmen and leaders is at once the most ele- 
mentary and the nicest problem of social growth. 
History is but the record of this group leadership ; 
and yet how infinitely changeful is its type and 
history ! And of all types and kinds, what can be 
more instructive than the leadership of a group 
within a group — that curious double movement 
where real progp-ess may be negative and actual 
advance be relative retrogression? All this is the 
social student's inspiration and despair. 

When sticks and stones and beasts form the sole 
environment of a people, their attitude is ever one 
of determined opposition to, and conquest of, nat- 
ural forces. But when to earth and brute is added 
an environment of men and ideas, then the attitude 
of the imprisoned group may take three main 
forms : a feeling of revolt and revenge ; an attempt 

•Up fbom Slavery. An Autobiography. By Booker 
T. Waahmgton. New York : Doableday, Page & Co. 



54 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



to adjust all thought and action to the will of the 
greater group ; or, finally, a determined attempt at 
self-development, self-realization, in spite of environ- 
ing discouragements and prejudice. The influence 
of all three of these attitudes is plainly to be traced 
in the evolution of race leaders among American 
negroes. Before 1750 there was but the one motive 
of revolt and revenge which animated the terrible 
Maroons and veiled all the Americas in fear of 
insurrection. But the liberalizing tendencies of the 
latter half of the eighteenth century brought the 
first thought of adjustment and assimilation in the 
crude and earnest songs of Phillis and the martyr- 
dom of Attucks and Salem. 

The cotton-gin changed all this, and men then, 
as the Lyman Abbotts of to-day, found a new mean- 
ing in human blackness. A season of hesitation 
and stress settled on the black world as the hope of 
emancipation receded. Forten and the free Ne- 
groes of the North still hoped for eventual assimi- 
lation with the nation ; Allen, the founder of the 
great African Methodist Church, strove for unbend- 
ing self-development, and the Southern freedmen 
followed him ; while among the black slaves at the 
South arose the avenging Nat Turner, fired by the 
memory of Toussaint the Savior. So far, Negro 
leadership had been local and spasmodic ; but now, 
about 1840, arose a national leadership — a dynasty 
not to be broken. Frederick Douglass and the 
moral revolt against slavery dominated Negro 
thought and effort until after the war. Then, with 
the sole weapon of self-defense in perilous times, 
the ballot, which the nation gave the freedmen, men 
like Langston and Bruce sought to guide the polit- 
ical fortunes of the blacks, while Payne and Price 
still clung to the old ideal of self-development. 

Then came the reaction. War memories and 
ideals rapidly passed, and a period of astonishing 
commercial development and expansion ensued. A 
time of doubt and hesitation, of storm and stress, 
overtook the f reedmen's sons ; and then it was that 
Booker Washington's leadership began. Mr. Wash- 
ington came with a clear simple programme, at the 
psychological moment ; at a time when the nation 
was a little ashamed of having bestowed so much 
sentiment on Negroes and was concentrating its 
energies on Dollars. The industrial training of 
Negro youth was not an idea originating with Mr. 
Washington, nor was the policy of conciliating the 
white South wholly his. But he first put life, un- 
limited energy, and perfect faith into this pro- 
gramme; he changed it from an article of belief 
into a whole creed ; he broadened it from a by-path 
into a veritable Way of Life. And the method by 
which he accomplished this is an interesting study 
of human life. 

Mr. Washington's narrative gives but glimpses 
of the real struggle which he has had for leader- 
ship. First of all, he strove to gain the sympathy 
and cooperation of the white South, and gained it 
after that epoch-making sentence spoken at Atlanta: 
'' In all things that are purely social we can be as 



separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all 
things essential to mutual progress" (p. 221). 
This conquest of the South is by all odds the most 
notable thing in Mr. Washington's career. Next 
to this comes his achievement in gaining place and 
consideration in the North. Many others less 
shrewd and tactful would have fallen between these 
two stools ; but as Mr. Washington knew the heart 
of the South from birth and training, so by singular 
insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of the age 
that was dominating the North. He learned so 
thoroughly the speech and thought of triumphant 
commercialism and the ideals of material prosperity 
that he pictures as the height of absurdity a black 
boy studying a French grammar in the midst of 
weeds and dirt. One wonders how Socrates or 
St. Francis of Assissi would receive this ! 

And yet this very singleness of vision and 
thorough oneness with his age is a mark of the 
successful man. It is as though Nature must needs 
make men a little narrow to give them force. At 
the same time, Mr. Washington's success. North 
and South, with his gospel of Work and Money, 
raised opposition to him from widely divergent 
sources. The spiritual sons of the Abolitionists 
were not prepared to acknowledge that the schools 
founded before Tuskegee, by men of broad ideals 
and self-sacrificing souls, were wholly failures, or 
worthy of ridicule. On the other hand, among his 
own people Mr. Washington found deep suspicion 
and dislike for a man on such good terms with 
Southern whites. 

Such opposition has only been silenced by Mr. 
Washington's very evident sincerity of purpose. 
We forgive much to honest purpose which is ac- 
complishing something. We may not agree with 
the man at all points, but we admire him and 
cooperate with him so far as we conscientiously can. 
It is no ordinary tribute to this man's tact and

diverse interests and opinions, he to-day commands

not. 

Among the Negroes, Mr. Washington is still far 
from a popular leader. Educated and thoughtful 
Negroes everywhere are glad to honor him and aid 
him, but all cannot agree with him. He represents 
in Negro thought the old attitude of adjustment to 
environment, emphasizing the economic phase ; but 
the two other strong currents of feeling, descended 
from the past, still oppose him. One is the thought 
of a small but not unimportant group, unfortunate 
in their choice of spokesman, but nevertheless of 
much weight, who represent the old ideas of revolt 
and revenge, and see in migration alone an outlet 
for the Negro people. The second attitude is that 
of the large and important group represented by 
Dunbar, Tanner, Chesnut, Miller, and the Grimkes, 
who, without any single definite programme, and 
with complex aims, seek nevertheless that self- 
development and self-realization in all lines of

haman endeavor which they believe will eventually 
place the Negro beside the other races. While 
theae men respect the Hampton-Taskegee idea to a 
degree, they believe it falls far short of a complete 
programme. They believe, therefore, also in the 
higher education of Fisk and Atlanta Universities ; 
they believe in self-assertion and ambition ; and 
they believe in the right of saffrage for blacks on 
the same terms with whites. 

Sach is the complicated world of thought and 
action in which Mr. Booker Washington has been 
called of God and man to lead, and in which he 
has gained so rare a meed of success.

Xew Testamext Criticism axd 
History.* 

Three new volumes are added to Professor 
Mathews's admirable series of New Testament 
hand-books, of which five have now appeared in all. 
Professor Nash, of Cambridge, contributes a timely 
little volume on the " History of the Higher Criti- 
cism." The author rightly claims high ground for 
criticism, finding in it almost the greatest religious 
expression of our time. While his style is some- 
times full of unrest, and he seems in general to 
view criticism from without, not from within, his 
large-minded and sympathetic treatment promises 
to do an important work in removing misconcep- 
tions, disarming prejudice, and winning for the 
Higher Criticism the generous welcome it deserves 
at the hands of all lovers of the Bible. 

The volume on '' Biblical Theology of the New 
Testament," by the late Professor Gould, possesses 
a sad interest as the last work of that distinguished 
scholar. Its method is to take up successively the 
teaching of Jesus as gathered from the Synoptists, 
the early teaching of the apostles as reflected in the 
first part of Acts, the teaching of Paul, the later Apos- 
tolic teaching — James, I. Peter, the Apocalypse, — 
and, finally, the writings of the Alexandrian period. 
These last are divided into the Johannean, — the 
Gospel and first epistle of John, — and the non- 
Johannean. in which latter class, along with He- 
brews, II. Peter, and Jude, one observes with some 
surprise not only the pastoral epistles but Epbesians 
and Colossians. However scholar^ may differ as 
to particular points of introduction or interpretation, 
the natural and logical method of this work, com-

bined with the well-known scholarship of Professor 
Gould, assures the new handbook wide usefulness. 

Professor Bacon's Introduction, the fifth of his 
New Testament handbooks, yields to no one of its 
predecessors in resources of scholarship or skill of 
presentation. Professor Bacon's thorough conver- 
sance with the processes and results of criticism, 
and his own great and even brilliant qualities as a 
critic, unite to make his contribution to the series a 
very notable one. Indeed, it is doubtful whether 
so much of real value as to New Testament intro- 
duction was ever before brought within the limits 
of a volume of this size. We echo the hope, already 
expressed by others, that the author may undertake 
a larger work on the same subject, in which there 
shall be room for a fuller treatment of many mat- 
ters which considerations of space and proportion 
have reduced in this handbook to tantalizing brevity. 

Dr. Purves's account of " Christianity in the 
Apostolic Age," with President Rhees's " Life of 
Jesus." constitutes the distinctly New Testament 
division of the " Historical Series for Bible Stu- 
dents," edit«d by Professors Charles F. Kent and 
Frank K. Sanders, six volumes of which have now 
appeared. While Dr. Purves sometimes discnsses 
the suggestions of critics, he uniformly decides 
against them, and his book is thus written from the 
traditional point of view. For those who desire a 
new, even if not a particularly fresh, statement of 
the old positions on the apostolic age, this book will 
be acceptable ; but those who are looking for a 
sympathetic presentation of the critical position 
will be disappointed in it. Mechanically, the vol- 
ume leaves something to be desired, as the paper is 
poor and the proof-reading not always good (e- g.^ 
Lasca for Lasea, p. 255).

Dualism in religious belief is the idea 
first presented by Dr. Paul Cams in 
his interesting '' History of the Devil 
and the Idea of Evil " (Open Court Co., Chicago). 
The conflict between light and darkness, life and 
death, good and evil, early gained man's attention 
and has left a deep impression on most of the g^eat 
religious systems of the world. In Dr. Carns's 
work there is presented a mass of ideas and beliefs 
gathered from all peoples and all times. Starting 
with Devil worship — rather, the worship of bad or 
cruel gods from impulses of fear — the author 
shows its prevalence among many less-cultured peo- 
ples. He next examines the religions of the Acca- 
dians and early Semites for similar evidences. 
Persian Dualism, Israel, Brahmanism and Buddh- 
ism are successively studied, and the elements of 
demon-worship, cruelty and evil are traced in all. 
With the " Dawn of a New Era " ushering in Early 
Christianity, higher ideals of good and God prevail,

bat the old dualistic conception still lingers. In 
Christianity a personal devil, prince of darkness, 
emerges better defined than ever before. The real 
interest of the book and its more legitimate matter 
are found in the chapters from this point onward. 
The Devil of Christianity is sometimes a veritable 
Lucifer, almost an angel of light, a being so noble 
and passionate as to cause respect in spite of his 
wickedness ; commonly, however, as through the 
Middle Ages, he dwindles into a poor, harmless 
being, of little wit, the constant dupe and victim of 
the godly. The notion that persons sold themselves 
to the Devil is fairly discussed, with all the related 
matter of witchcraft. From the detection and pun- 
ishment of witchcraft, the author passes to the In- 
quisition, upon the horrors of which he dilates with 
evident gusto. After tracing modern conceptions 
of the Devil, especially as shown in literature and 
art, he closes with a discussion of the philosophical 
problem of Good and Evil. It is evident from this 
cursory statement of the author's treatment that the 
book abounds in interesting matter culled from 
many sources and representing much labor. The 
author has shown great diligence in gathering illus- 
trative material, and it is doubtful if any such col- 
lection of ancient and modern, quaint and curious, 
picturesque and frightful pictures relative to the 
subject has been before offered to English readers. 
The mechanical execution of the work is noticeably 
good, and the cover — in black and red, with a rep- 
resentation of the Devil and the Serpent stamped 
upon it — is striking and original.

society — using the phrase in its 
highest sense, — and a philanthropist and publicist 
of no mean order, is surely sufficient distinction to 
warrant commemoration in book form. Nor did 
Mrs. E. D. Gillespie need the high encouragement 
which came from the late George William Curtis 
to induce her to set forth these things, and many 
more, in the pleasant volume she has written under 
the name of "A Book of Remembrance " (Lippin- 
cott). Born in Philadelphia, the daughter of a man 
of much distinction in his day, she was married 
when little more than a girl to an officer in the 
Marine Corps of the United States, but not until she 
had travelled extensively through the far western 
country at a time when Pittsburgh and Cincinnati 
were on the frontier, and had lived for a time in 
Washington, then the unformed capital of an un- 
formed nation. With the Civil War came her first 
opportunity for public service, and Mrs. Gillespie 
was one of the first of those nobly patriotic women 
to whom the almost infinite mercies of the Sanitary 
Commission were due. When the Centennial Ex- 
position was determined upon, Mrs. Gillespie was 
made the head of the Woman's Auxiliary to the 
Commission, and she rendered services of the 
greatest value to her own city and to the country 
at large. Never wearied in well doing, it was she 



who brought together the great collection of Revo- 
lutionary relics which was exhibited in the Gov- 
ernment Building during the World's Columbian 
Exposition in Chicago. At the present time Mrs. 
Gillespie does not find herself too old to take a 
prominent part in the several societies for women 
based upon descent from Colonial and Revolution- 
ary notabilities. Her book is pleasantly written, 
and the attractive list of illustrations includes some 
interesting portraits of the Franklins and their 
descendants. The volume is handsomely made, in 
a style appropriate to its souvenir character.

Nineteenth Century, an Utopian Retrospect " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.) in the form of a dialogue 
between the thirster after knowledge and the willing 
imparter of it, he has contrived to make his work a 
little less entertaining than usual. The late Edward 
Bellamy made the same error of presentation in 
" Equality," a book with which Dr. Ellis's invites 
certain comparisons. The scene of this later work 
is laid in that distant future of the idealist when 
man is living in full accord with the Golden Rule 
and civilization has become real rather than pre- 
tentious. The actualities of the century just gone 
are disclosed with a touch which is rather wonder- 
ing than appreciative, affording a sufficient antidote 
to the duller forms of optimism. The treatment is 
rather logical than satirical, though this last touch 
is not lacking in such episodes as that which repre- 
sents the Utopians of the future as preserving a 
factory town, with all its nineteenth century soot 
and grime, starvation and wealth, piety and misery, 
as a horrible example for a civilization further ad- 
vanced to study and profit by. In a similar man- 
ner, New York is said to have an annual " mystery " 
in which nineteenth-century conditions are repro- 
duced for the Utopians to amaze themselves with, 
though the very nature of the presentation requires 
no little idealization. One sly dig is given at the 
love of dirt which possessed the average nineteenth- 
century Englishman, and the book alternately 
amuses and exasperates the idealist. It can be 
commended freely to those who need to be disillu- 
sioned. 

The Rev. Frank Sewall has made 
a translation, which Messrs. Small, 
Maynard & Co. have published, of 
"The Trophies" of M. Jos^ Maria de H^r^dia. 
The book is one of highly artistic manufacture, 
beautifully printed, and embellished with orna- 
mental borders and initials by Mr. Bertram Good- 
hue. Of the translation we may say that it almost 
succeeds in an impossible achievement. The perfect 
art of these sonnets could not possibly be repro- 
duced in another form of speech, but Mr. Sewall, 
by freeing himself from the restraint of rhyme, has 
been able to preserve much of the distinction of 
the original, and his versions are usually acceptable

" Content in 
a Garden." 



and in good taste. We will illustrate by one of 
the finest as well as one of the most familiar of the 
poems. 

'* Like flight of falcons from their native crag:8, 
Content no more in their high solitude, 
From Palos or Mogaer the Captains sailed 
Half dmnk with dreams of deeds heroic and wild. 
They went to seize the fabled metal veins 
Cipango ripens in her distant mines ; 
The trade winds bent their lateen yards toward 
The shores mysterious of the Western World. 
Each evening hoping for an epic mom. 
The phosphorescent azure of the sea 
Would charm their sleep with its mirage of gold ; 
Or, leaning o'er the caravel's white bow. 
They saw ascending in an unknown sky 
New stars from out the depths of Ocean." 

Those who know the glorious alexandrines of the 
original, with their sonorous march and their magical 
charm, will not be greatly moved by such a trans- 
lation as this, but they will recognize that it does 
faithfully, within its limitations, about all that an 
English version could be expected to accomplish. 

Mrs. Candace Wheeler's volume 
" Content in a Garden " (Houghton) 
is an exquisite creation. It is rare that 
a book is endowed with such complete and satisfying 
eharm. An artis't by nature and culture has set 
hand and thought to its production, and the result 
is an original and finished bit of work. We might 
call it a symphony in green, were the term not too 
pretentious for an effect so simple and unaffected. 
The entire book, except the paper and the print, is 
dressed in shades of chlorophyll, the substance which 
gives color to the stem and the leaf of the plant. 
The cover, the leaf edges, the drawings, the mar- 
ginal lines, are all in these soft, harmonious tints. 
Another pleasing feature is the novel arrangement 
of the text, which, confined to the inner portion of 
the page, leaves broad free spaces at the sides and 
bottom. These give room for Dora Wheeler Keith's 
decorations, consisting of graceful sprays of flowers 
taken from specimens in the author's garden. The 
text itself is the overflow of a woman's delight in 
the manifold beauty pervading the floral kingdom. 
It is interesting and stimulating, impressing on the 
reader the happiness to be had in the possession of 
a garden, in the thought and the labor devoted to 
it, and in the possibilities of aesthetic development 
that arise from an intelligent study of the subject. 
To Mrs. Wheeler a garden is a genuine art-work, 
after the manner of a painting, and in the massing 
and grading of colors should be as carefully and 
correctly studied. There is much valuable sugges- 
tion in her statements, and this, with their attractive 
setting, renders her book a veritable treasure. 

As was to be expected of a life of 
Whittier in the " Beacon Biogra- 
phies " (Small, Maynard & Co.), Pro- 
fessor Burton's volume is a model of what such a 
brief biography should be. " His career was broader 
than that of the recluse man of letters; one in 
which life was reckoned as more than literature." 



A good 
thort life 
of WMUier. 



With this understanding of his subject the book has 
been written ; and the wholesomeness of Whittier'g 
family affections, his fine devotion to principle, his 
love of justice and of his fellow men, his delight in 
the music of words, are all shown as parts of a fine 
and true manhood. Critical conclusions in regard 
to his poetry are merely touched upon, but, notwith- 
standing the author's sympathy with his subject, he 
is not blind to Whittier's limitations. "* In his cor- 
respondence occur remarks to indicate that he looked 
at his literary work as an aside, the central thing 
being his work as a reformer "; and in some such 
fact as this we may find a great deal of the pathos 
of literary effort in the New World. The frontis- 
piece portrait, — not the one with which we are all 
familiar, — shows a poetic face, fine, sensitive, 
spiritual ; but the shaping of a new civilization de- 
manded hard work of a more practical sort than 
the writing of poetry filled with beauty, and Whit- 
tier responded nobly to the more urgent need. 
There is a very engaging literary quality in Mr. 
Burton's writing, and the details of a life in some 
aspects hard and barren here gain a new and gra- 
cious meaning. 

The dignity " Home Thoughts "by some unpre- 

andhappinetM tending person writing under the

is not a startling book, or a deep book, or a re- 
markably original book, but it is a book of whole- 
some advice for those who care for the happiness 
of family life. The thirty-one essays making np 
the volume were printed first in the New York 
" Evening Post," and are therefore brief and to the 
point. Among them, " T^e Homelessness of Certain 
Married People," " The Lamentable Publicity of 
Modern Life," *' Responsibility for Influence," and 
" Era of too Plain Speech " are especially full of 
thoughtful comment and wise counsel. A paragraph 
from the last of these may well be quoted : " Nor 
does the plain speech of our day stop short with 
the discussion of disease : offences against morality 
are now considered entirely open topics of conver- 
sation. The ' touching of pitch ' has not ceased to 
be a clinging defilement, and no student of psychical 
conditions can possibly doubt that young minds 
shrink with less horror from those forms of evil 
which they are allowed to speak of freely to their 
companions, or in the family circle." This and 
much more in the book is well worth writing for 
those who are willing to pause for a moment in the 
hurry of life and give thought to some little things 
that are not unimportant.

and its blossoming thickets where the naocking-bird 
sings his wondrous dropping song, are described in 
the prose poems of the nature-lover of Paradise 
Circle. It seems quite fitting to find among these 
pages a chapter on Theocritus, the poet of the poor, 
and to turn from his Doric flute-scores to an appre- 
ciation of Montaigne that sends us all to dusty 
library shelves for the essays of that old writer. 
It was Mr. Thompson's foible to assume a gentle 
contempt for the writers of modern science, leading 
us to think they are afraid of style and tremble at 
the sight of a well-turned phrase. Yet he confesses 
to the keeping of many bird notes, to appear some 
day in a scientific report. May we all see the book !

A new volume The third volume of Professor 
0/ the CyeiopcBdia Bailey's "Cyclop»dia of American 
of Horticulture. Horticulture" (Macmillan) brings 
the titles through the letter Q. These volumes 
have appeared with remarkable promptiiess, when 
one considers the enormous amount of detail they 
involve. To the systematist, the synopses o£ certain 
important genera are of most interest ; but to those 
inclined to horticultural operations, some of the 
later titles will be found more important. The 
culture of Orchids is well presented by Robert N. 
Grey ; the Peach is treated by several experts, the 
general article being written by Professor Bailey 
himself, and peach culture in the various notable 
regions being treated by different writers. The 
Pear and Plum are treated in the same way. Just 
at this time, titles that should attract considerable 
attention are those relating to the horticultural 
capabilities of the Philippines and of Porto Rico. 
General articles of special importance are found 
under the titles " Physiology of Plants," by Dr. 
B. M. Duggar of Cornell University, and " Plant 
Breeding," by Mr. H. J. Webber of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. The States whose horticultural 
possibilities are presented happen to be numerous 
in this volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



It is now more than thirty years since Dr. Alexander 
Campbell Fraser, then upwards of fifty years of age, 
prepared for the Clarendon Press his monumental 
edition of the works of Bishop Berkeley. The same 
scholar, now an octogenarian, has recently prepared 
for the same publishing agency a new and thoroughly 
revised edition of the writings of the great philosopher, 
believing, as do all students of the subject, that they 
still "contain a word in season, even for the twentieth 
century." The new edition fills four volumes, and in- 
cludes much new matter that the past thirty years have 
brought to light. 

" The International Year Book " for 1900, just pub- 
lished by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., is a volume that 
extends to considerably upwards of a thousand pages, 
the enlargement being due to the importance of the 



year in politics, both national and international. It is 
a very useful publication, now made increasingly so 
by the addition of an index, cumulative of the con- 
tents of the three annual volumes thus far published. 
Peculiarly valuable features are the fifty-page appendix 
on the " Progress of the Century," and the twenty 
pages of tables from the Census of 1900. The editor- 
ship is in the hands of Mr. Frank Moore Colby, with 
the assistance of the versatile Prof. H. T. Peck — and 
what he knows not, as the public is well aware, is not 
knowledge. 

Mr. William Archer has undertaken a "new and 
revised edition " of his translations of " The Prose 
Dramas of Henrik Ibsen," and the first volume, con- 
taining " The League of Youth," has just been imported 
by the Messrs. Scribner. This volume contains also a 
" general preface " to the series, in which the translator 
sets forth his ideas concerning the exact degree of 
colloquialism that is desirable in an English version of 
Dr. Ibsen's dramas of modern society. On the whole, 
in this revised edition, Mr. Archer has reverted to a 
somewhat more conventional manner than he saw fit to 
adopt ten years ago. The problem is no doubt a difficult 
one, and, as Mr. Archer justly says, there are few 
models offered the English translator of the modern 
prose drama. 

Along with a very sensible essay on the Historical 
Novel, Prof. Brander Matthews has put eleven others, 
also sensible, on such subjects as Romance against 
Romanticism, the Study of Fiction, the Conventions of 
the Drama, and the Art and Mystery of Collaboration. 
These essays are the work of a man who has given him- 
self to the service of literature, and his knowledge of 
life and of craftsmanship has a mature soundness that 
makes his papers represent very much more than the 
immediate labor of their composition. The essays are 
easy reading, not because they lack acuteness, but he- 
cause they are so unaffected and sensible. (Scribner's 
Sons). 

Mr. Arthur B. Maurice has gathered together his 
articles that appeared in "The Bookman" in 1899 and 
1900, and published them in a volume entitled " New 
York in Fiction" (Dodd, Mead & Co.). It is freely 
illustrated with views of places, chiefly houses, which 
have served as scenes for the fiction of more than a 
score of writers from Irving and Cooper down. The 
book is interesting, partly because it identifies so many 
places that gain in significance from their use in fiction, 
and partly because it once more forcibly illustrates the 
old truth that writers of description do best, not when 
they invent, but \^hen they write with their " eye on 
the object." 

The latest French and German texts are the follow- 
ing: "Voyages en Zigzag" (Holt), by Rudolphe 
Topffer, edited by Mr. A. R. Hope; "La Fille du

is now on the market. 

« The Bilioustine," Mr. Bert Leston Taylor's amusing 
satire on the Roycrofters of East Aurora and their 
work, as originally printed in a Chicago morning paper, 
has been published in pamphlet form, in close imitation 
of an issue of " The Philistine," by Mr. William S.

"The Discovery of the Old Northwest," by Mr.

We are glad to have a reprint (Oxford: B. H. Black- 
well) of the " Practical Discourse on Some Principles of 
Hymn-Singing " which Mr. Robert Bridges contributed 
to the " Journal of Theological Studies " for October, 
1899. What Mr. Bridges has to say upon the subject of 
rhythm and metric is always weighty, and our literature 
is notably deficient in competent discussion of these 
subjects. 

Mr. Henry Holt's " Talks on Civics," published by 
the Macmillan Co., is a volume of discussions in dialogue 
intended for young readers and students. A good many 
matters of both government and law are presented in 
an exceptionally lucid manner, and the young man or 
woman who is repelled by text-books of the formal sort 
may be successfully reached by the ingenious conver- 
sational de vices of the present work. 

" Corneille " and " The French Academy," by Mr. 
Leon H. Vincent, are two small books recently pub- 
lished by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Mr. Vincent 
seems to have in contemplation a series of essays upon 
the French literature of the great period, and a similar 
volume on " Moliere " is already announced. This field 
of criticism has been rather neglected by English wri- 
ters, and is deserving of much more attention than it 
receives. 

That enterprising California magazine, substantial 
and useful not less than ornamental and entertaining, 
" The Land of Sunshine," begins with its July number 
a regular department called " The Twentieth Century 
West," in which such large practical topics as Irriga- 
tion, Colonization, etc., will receive special and compe- 
tent discussion. The articles will be by various writers, 
and the whole will be in charge of Mr. Wm. E. Smythe, 



well known for his efficient service in founding our Na- 
tional Irrigation Congress, and through his notable and 
convincing book on " The Conquest of Arid America." 
There is great work to be done in these fields in the 
immediate future, and it is fitting that Mr. Lummis's 
magazine, as the representative one of the Western 
country, should take a foremost part in doing it. 

When we reviewed, not long ago, the autobiography

might remain to him, and the material for several more 
chapters of the autobiography. Mr. Stillman died on the 
sixth of this month, at his home in Surrey, at the age of 
seventy-three, and the record of his busy and varied 
career thus stands practically complete in the two vol- 
umes that were so recently upon our table. 

The Globe School Book Co. are the publishers of an 
" Introduction to the Study of English Literature," by 
Miss Vida D. Scudder. It is a text-book for high school 
or college use, modern in its methods, fair in its judg- 
ments, and made exceedingly helpful to the teacher by 
its tables, references, and suggestions for class-room 
work. The text is readable — almost too much so for 
the purposes of a school manual, — and the ethical and 
social prepossessions of the writer enter into the discus- 
sion rather more fully than is usual in a work of this 
sort. 

The issue of " Municipal Affairs," dated March, 1901, 
is a special number in the form of " A Bibliography of 
Municipal Problems and City Conditions," prepared by 
Mr. Robert C. Brooks. It is a work of over three 
hundred large pages and more than twelve thousand 
entries, a fact which testifies most eloquently to the 
interest which the world is taking in the problems of 
municipal government. The work represents a great 
enlargement of the bibliography published four years 
ago, and is an indispensable help to every student of the 
subject. 

An interesting little compilation of " Book Titles 
from Shakspere " has been prepared and issued in a 
privately printed edition by Mr. Volney Streamer. 
From this dainty booklet we learn that " Hamlet " has 
been drawn upon more frequently than any other of the 
dramas, about one-third of Mr. Streamer's list being 
taken from that source. " As You Like It" is next in 
favor, followed closely by " Macbeth " and " Othello." 
Mr. Howells stands first in the list of authors who have 
laid Shakespeare under contribution for title purposes, 
thirteen of his novels having been named from the 
plays. 

The American Revision Committee have completed 
their work of revision of the Holy Bible, and it will be 
published by Messrs. Thomas Nelson & Sons, New 
York, in August. Besides incorporating the Appendix 
in the text, the Committee have bestowed much time in 
rectifying the errors, inconsistencies, oversights, and 
infelicities which have been detected. Moreover, inas- 
much as the American Revisers, in preparing the Ap- 
pendix of 1885, aimed to reduce the differences to the 
lowest limit, they waived the larger part of their pre- 
ferences, many of which they regarded as of decided 
importance. This new edition will embody a consider- 
able part of these emendations, which represent the de- 
liberate preferences of the whole American Committee, 
but which were not put into the Appendix. Carefully 
selected marginal references and concise topical headings 
have also been added.

Travel to the West 

More and more each year Americans are finding- 
out the attractions of our own country, and as 
they grow to realize the charm of life among the 
Colorado mountains or in the Yellowstone Park 
the tendency is toward greater travel West 
instead of East for health and recreation. The 
railroads, too, are alive to the new conditions 
and have made lower tourist rates this year than 
ever before. And then the train time has been 
vastly improved, so that now it takes only one 
night on the road between the Atlantic Coast 
and Denver, that is, by using the Burlington's 
fast train from Chicago.

when you want them. 

QRAUSTARK ; The story of a Love Behind a Throne. By George Barr 

McCuTCHEON. 12mo, cloth $1.50 

*' Lovers of a good, msliiiig novel with abandance of thrill and dash in it can turn with ooniidence to 
* Graastark.' And having taken up the book, it is safe to say the reader will not lay it aside until 
it is finished." — Chicago Tribune. 

BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON. By Mrs. Reginald de Koven. 

12mo, cloth 1.50 

A story which successfully combines romance and historical fact. The atmosphere is charming, 
with the hanging gardens of Babylon for a background, and picturesque ceremonies and feasts of 
Artazerxes, King of Kings, his Court, and the people for an accompaniment. The hero is one of 
the captive Jews, the friend of Themistocles, the Qreek ; and the action centres in the intrigues of 
the priests of Bel-Merodach and the King's love of a beautiful Jewess. 

EZRA CAINE. By Joseph W. Sharts. 12mo, cloth 1.25 

The work of a new writer, the book yet gives the impression of masterful force. It is a weird bit 
of imaginative realism, which clutches the mind as sharply as a story by Foe. Its mystery, its 
terror, its extraordinary realization of the dread of an unknown horror, are not lightly forgotten. 

THE INN OF THE SILVER MOON. By Herman K. Viele. a new 

edition, illustrated by Cucuel. 16mo, cloth 1.25 

" It is a fanciful bit of writing, full of charm and humor." — The Bookman. 

"This is a delicious little extravaganza." — New York Commercial Advertiser. 

" The story is told in a charming style, and with touches that at times resemble Mr. Stockton's 

work. Its whimsical humor and quaint adventures are irresistible." — Boston Transcript. 

EUPHROSYNE AND HER GOLDEN BOOK. By Elsworth Law- 
son. 12mo, cloth 1.25 

This story was not written for the lovers of tinsel, nor for those readers to whom battle and murder 
are the very meat and drink of romance. But to others who have grown a bit weary of blood, for 
whom to-day holds something of value, and the gallantry of courts is not all there is of life, this 
book will be more refreshing than wine. 

LOVE AMONG THE ARTISTS. A novel by George Bernard Shaw. 

12mo, cloth 1.50 

A new volume in the authorized edition of the works of this brilliant English novelist, dramatist, 
and critic. There can be no doubt that Mr. Shaw is one of the most amusing of present-day 
writers, and in this novel, according to many reviewers, he is at his best. ^_^_

— Boston Times. 
" It is a good novel in comparison with even the best

author, is a young Southerner who in this, her maiden

" Mr. Barnes's side incidents and personal experiences

cumulative interest that increases aa the story ascends to its 
climax. " — Philadelphia Item. 

"The rakish days of Beau Brummel afforded delightful ma- 
terial for a brilliant and diverting romance, and the author of 
" D'Arcy of the Guards " has made the fullest use of it. The story 
lacks little in either boldness or brilliancy." — Cleveland World. 



A POWERFUL AMERICAN NOVEL 

THE BELEAGUERED FOREST A Novel 

By Elia W. Peattie. 12mo, cloth, S1.50. 
A remarkable romance, set in a fresh and picturesque scene. Mrs. Peattie, well known throughout the middle 
West, is a writer of fine imaginative gifts. This engaging story traces, with originality and vividness, the develop- 
ment of a woman's character. The main action passes in the great pine woods of northern Michigan, whose very 
spirit is caught in these graphic pages. " The Beleaguered Forest" is the consistent study of a woman's inconsistency. 
It has the tough strength, the nigged morality, and the swift action of the strenuous life the author knows so intimately. 
A wide experience in traveling all over our dominions has given invaluable help in securing literary proportion, con- 
trast, and accent. For several years she has been a successful contributor to Western papers and to the leading 
American magazines. All this work has brought a goodly reputation as a capable and vigorous writer on Western life. 

The three hundredth issue of APPLETONS' FAMOUS TOWN AND COUNTRY LIBRARY 

is signalized and adorned with a new and artistic cover design. This comely binding, which is the style in 
which the TOWN AND COUNTRY LIBRARY will hereafter appear, suggests the broad appeal of 
the series — its popularity in the busy mart and in the shady mead far from the madding crowd.

and Country Library." 12mo, cloth, $1.00; paper, 50 cts. 

" It is seldom one lays down a book with a feeling of such genuine friendliness toward writer and story. ... It 
runs so easily, in such a natural, unforced style, that the delight increases with every page." — Chicago Journal, 

" It is not too much to say that with him died greater promise of an heir to the manner and method of Dickens 
than has been manifested by anyone." — Boston Journal. 



FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER 

An Every-Dsy Romance. By Maxwell Gray, author of 

" The Silence of Dean Maitland." No. 301, Appletons' 

Town and Country Library. 12mo, clo., $1.; paper, 50c. 

This new novel by the author of " The Silence of Dean 

Maitland " shows a lightness of touch and continuity of 

interest which will make it one of her most popular books. 

She has written a story of English country life which 

shows a clearness in characterization and a vivacity and 

variety which will be thoroughly appreciated.

is once begun, for mystery is always fascinating, and this 
is a tale of mystery that is decidedly out of the ordinary 
and is remarkably well executed." — Toledo Daily Blade.

YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



Following our custom of many years, we 
have prepared for this and the following num- 
ber of The Dial a condensation of the sum- 
maries of the year's work in Continental 
literature appearing in " The Athenseum " for 
July 6. The articles this year are twelve in 
number : Belgium being dealt with by Pro- 
fessor Fredericq, Bohemia by Dr. Tille, Den- 



mark by Dr. Ipsen, France by M. Pravieux, 
Germany by Dr. Heilborn, Greece by Professor 
Lambros, Holland by Mr. C. K. Elout, Hun- 
gary by Mr. Katscher, Italy by Dr. Biagi, 
Norway by Herr Brinchmann, Poland by Dr. 
Belcikowski, and Spain by Don Kafael Al- 
bamvia. Sweden and Russia are the only two 
countries of literary importance which are not 
represented upon the present occasion. 

Professor Fredericq, writing of Belgium, 
deals first with the French writers, then with 
the Flemish. Among the former, M. Maeter- 
linck occupies the place of honor with " La 
Vie des Abeilles," which we have already had 
in an English translation. M. Georges Eck- 
houd, fresh from a prosecution for immorality, 
from which charge he has been acquitted, " ia 
now beginning again ardently " with his 
" Faneuse d'Amour." A few of the most im- 
portant books are these . " Petites Legendes " 
and " Philippe II.," both by M. Verhaeren ; 
" Poemes Agrestes," by M. Joseph Liesse ; 
" Trente Ans de Critique Litteraire," by the 
late Gustave Frederix ; " Sainte-Beuve In- 
connu," by M. de Spoelberch de Louvenjoul ; 
" Styles et Caracteres," by M. Georges Le- 
grand ; " L'Industrie dans la Grece Ancienne," 
by M. Henri Francotte ; " Clovis," by M. G. 
Kurth ; " Les Boers et les Origines des Re- 
publiques Sud-Africaines," by M. Jules Le- 
clercq ; " La Grece Contemporaine," by Baron 
Guillaume ; " La Chine en 1899," by M. Jules 
Duckerts ; " De Bruxelles a Karema," by M. 
A. J. Wauters ; " Deux Ans au Congo," by 
M. Constant de Deken ; and a number of works 
on international law and comparative legisla- 
tion. In Flemish literature, the following are 
noteworthy : A work on old Netherland songs, 
by M. F. van Dayse ; a " History of the Lit- 
erature of the Netherlands," by M. Emile 
Deneef ; " Twenty Flemish Faces," by the 
Abbe Hugo Verriest ; and a book on Henri 
Conscience, Jan van Beers, and Peter Benoit, 
by M. Pol de Mont. In Flemish belles-lettres 
we have " Summertide " and " Summerland," 
by M. Steyn Streuvels, a pastry cook by voca- 
tion ; " A Lion of Flanders," by M. Cyriel 
Buysse ; and, among theatrical pieces, the 
"Siddartha" of the MM. Minnaert, and two 
realistic pieces called " The Maker of Bricks " 



70 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



and "The Poachers," both by M. L. Scheltjens. 

Dr. V. Tille begins his report from Bohemia 
with the following paragraph : 

" Bohemian literature has been undergoing a crisis 
of transition for several years; this appears just now 
very palpably in belles-lettres, and this year's rather 
disappointing output does not point to any thorough 
change. The older generation has already passed its 
prime, and sums up its production by publishing various 
« collected works ' or ' final editions'; in the youngest 
there is a ferment of new tendencies and fresh ideas, 
which, however, appear more in plans and attempts at 
finding out new ways than in the production of mature 
literary work. Foreign influences, Western as well as 
Russian, both in fiction and criticism, operating exten- 
sively by means of an unusually large number of trans- 
lations, are clearly visible in all our contemporary 
writing." 

All this leads to criticism, and in this field 
the influence of the University is making itself 
felt. 

" Mr. Jaroslav Vrchlicky, the foremost amongst our 
poets, expounds in his university lectures the prominent 
epochs of Western literatures, adding at the same time 
copious specimens in his many translations, to which he 
has lately added a new volume of ' Artistic and Popular 
Poetry.' Other professors and lecturers sedulously 
cultivate literary history, and our recent University 
Extension prospers well, especially in spreading the 
knowledge of Bohemian literature." 

The death of the poet Julius Zeyer has been 
a " great loss to Bohemian letters," and has 
occasioned numerous critical estimates of his 
work. The novel of the day " has been influ- 
enced by foreign psychological and social 
romances." Among its representatives are 
« Lights of the Past," by Mr. Simacek ; " Re- 
bellion," by Miss Bozena Kuneticka; and the 
"Angelic Sonata" of Mr. Merhaut. Mr. 
Vrchlicky is to the front in both lyrical and 
dramatic composition. " The Water Fairy," 
a new opera by Mr. A. Dvorak, is mentioned 
here, partly for the sake of Mr. J. Kvapil's 
libretto, which is distinctly a literary work. 

Dr. Ipsen, speaking of Danish literature, 
reports a tendency of fiction to become his- 
torical, or otherwise objective. The veteran 
novelist. Professor H. F. Ewald, has added 
" Lisbeth Torbensdatter " to the list of his 
" big historical novels." Works by younger 
writers include " Ale Langskjaegs Saga," by 
Herr P. V. Hammer ; " Adelbrand and Mal- 
fred," by Herr Jacob Knudsen ; " Crumlin " 
(a Cromwell story), by Herr Carl Ewald ; 
and " Enevold Brandt," by Herr Svend Leo- 
pold. These are works of historical fiction. 
The novelists who have chosen to write of 
modern life have given us " Daily Bread," by 
Herr E. Soderberg; "The Springs," by Herr 



Z. Nielsen ; " The Unpardonable Sin," by 
Herr E. Egeberg ; " Lille Rodhsette " (Little 
Red Ridinghood), by Herr Henrik Pontoppi- 
dan ; " Seksten Aar," by Herr Karl Larsen ; 
and " Deeds of the Heart," by Herr Sven 
Lange. 

" Herr Mylius Erichsen has undertaken the task of 
describing in a large work the heath districts of Jut- 
land, which are now disappearing fast under the plough- 
share and the tooth of the harrow." 

Poetry has done better than fiction in Den- 
mark during the past year. Herr Valdemar 
Rordam's " Den Danske Tunge " is a volume 
of noteworthy verse, " pervaded by a remark- 
able sensitiveness, yet fortified by a manly 
spirit." Herr Drachmann has produced an 
Icelandic drama called " Half red Vanroia- 
deskjald." " Violin," a narrative in verse by 
Mrs. Blicher-Clausen, is the work of " the first 
female poet of any importance we have had." 
Two new translations of Shakespeare are now 
in course of publication. In literary history, 
three important works are noticed : Dr. V. 
Andersen's great biography of Oehlenschlager, 
Dr. Schwanenfliigel's life of Bishop Mynster, 
and Professor Bogh's biography of Christian 
Winther. 

M. Jules Pravieux's account of the year in 
French literature is long and interesting. He 
begins with the theatre, and the recent revival 
of M. Sardou's " Patrie," following by an ac- 
count of a play based upon Daudet's " La 
Petite Paroisse." M. F. Vanderem's "La 
Pente Douce " is " charming in its unerring 
analysis, the veracity of the characters, the 
sincerity of their actions, the grace of their 
talk." Of "Les RemplaQantes," by M. Brieux, 
we read — 

" The energy and occasional success with which M. 
Brieux attacks the most burning questions of the hour 
are familiar. In this play he studies one of the evils 
of our society : he brings forward wives who leave their 
husbands, their children, and their village to go to

rices ' into rich families." 

" La Course du Flambeau," by M. Paul Her- 
vieu, gets the most attention from the present 
writer. 

" His mysterious and bizarre title is a reminiscence 
of a Platonic idea and of a well-known verse of Lucre- 
tius. Generations pass on the earth and transmit to 
each other the torch of life, like the runners in the 
ancient ceremonies: — 

' Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt.' 
M. Hervieu, in a very close but simple action, of which 
the general effect is a little sad, has developed the idea 
that affection does not hark back; that mothers love 
their daughters more than they are loved; that the

heart, like the mind, always looks towards the future; 
that we are attached by a stronger bond to our children 
than to our parents; and that, if a crisis in family life 
obliges us to choose between the two, we prefer to side 
with our children, as the law of nature has decided." 

Other conspicuous plays are " La Veine," by 
M. Alfred Capus ; " Les Medicis," by M. 
Henri Lavedan ; and *' Pour I'Amour," by M. 
Auguste Dorcbain. In fiction, we have works 
by MM. Bourget, Zola, Theuriet, Rosny, 
France, Pouvillon, and others. No work by 
M. Bourget shows more clearly the influence 
of Taine than his novel " Un Homme d'Af- 
faires." " Le Fantome " is a second novel by 
the same author. Of M. Zola's "Travail" 
we read that it 

" Is a vast poem celebrating human labour. Work is 
for the individual what fertility is for the species — 
the means of existence. The thesis is developed on a 
large scale; the volume is stuffed full of life, as usual 
with M. Zola; it exhibits his great talents for descrip- 
tion, his art of evolving and moving masses of men; 
but it is composed on too ample a scale, it shows sym- 
bolism grown gross, and carelessness in style." 

M. Theuriet's novels are " Illusions Fauchees " 
and " La Petite Derniere." The MM. Rosny 
have published " Le Chemin d' Amour," a story 
of modern observation which has not, however, 
essentially " altered their romanticism and 
pantheism." 

" The book of M. France, * Monsieur Bergeret k 
Paris,' is simply a masterpiece, like its predecessors. 
Our language has never been so perfectly written, with 
such artistic avoidance of exaggeration, such sure ex- 
pression of thought in every detail. M. Bergeret judges 
with clear-sightedness and moderation the troubles 
' which Paris exposes to his view, and finds in the his- 
tory of olden time the explanation of almost every 
human circumstance. In « Voeu d'etre Chaste,' M. Pou- 
villon attacks a decidedly delicate and difBcult question. 
His work is beautiful, penetrating, sad, and movingly 
truthful, and his characters are vigorously conceived. 
Problems of conscience, painful and serious, are here 
well put before one, not as abstract theories, but as im- 
perious realities." 

Other novels are " La Carriere d'Andre Tour- 
ette," by M. Lucien Muhlfeld ; " Une Flambee 
d' Amour," by M. Masson-Forestier ; and " La 
Fleur de Joie," by Mme. Daniel Lesueur. The

" In his ' Testament Po^tique ' of this year shows strong 
irritation against the innovators who are attempting to 
transform traditional metres; and, although he is at 
pains not to be too rough with them, they have made 
him feel rather more than out of temper. He endeav- 
ours to set up against their pretensions a scientific 
theory demonstrating the excellence of the Parnassian 
metre." 

Other poetical productions are the "Voix 
Humaines" of M. Louis Sauty, the "Vers 



le Soir" of M. Albert Merat, the "Fleurs 
d'Aube " of Mme. Madeleine Paul, and the 
" Stances " of M. Jean Moreas. Literary 
history and criticism have rarely been better 
represented in France than during the past 
year. 

" M. Emile Boutronx has given ns the best and most 
profound study on Pascal yet written. He has taken 
up his work in a spirit of respectful admiration, but he 
possesses the critic's weapons, and it is as a learned 
scholar relying on documents that he has analyzed the 
* Provincial Letters ' and the ' Thoughts.' He has been 
careful not to yield to a common temptation and make 
Pascal into a philosopher." 

M. Gaston Paris has dealt 

" With old poems and ancient legends in his ' Po^mes 
et L^gendes du Moyen Age,' works which derive an 
agreeable flavour from their antiquity alone; tales al- 
most infantine, but revealing ingenious meanings and 
far-off thoughts to those who can decipher and under- 
stand them. These bygone tales M. Paris tells with a 
delightful charm, a delicate sense of their intimate 
poetry, a reverential feeling which is contagious." 

Other important works in this department are 
" Le Theatre Fran9ais avant la Periode Clas- 
sique," by M. Rigal ; " Le Theatre Fran9ai8 et 
Anglais," by M. Charles Hastings ; a volume 
of essays by M. Rene Doumic ; "Les Ecri- 
vains et les Mceurs," by M. Henry Bordeaux ; 
" Les Romanciers Anglais Contemporains," 
by M. Blaze de Bury ; and two books on Ras- 
kin, by MM. Jacques Bardoux and H. J. 
Brunhes. Among books of historical scholar- 
ship, the following are important : " Fouche," 
by M. Louis Madelin ; " La Noblesse Fran- 
9aise sous Richelieu," by M. le Vicomte G. 
d'Avenel ; and " Les Tron9ons da Glaive," 
by the MM. Paul et Victor Margueritte. The 
last-named book has almost the interest of a 
novel. It is concerned with the war of 1870, 
and " revives with an intimate sense of tragedy 
events which did not seem capable of being 
represented except by large exterior masses." 
A few other works of scholarship may be men- 
tioned. They are M. Emile Faguet's " Prob- 
lemes Politiques du Temps Present," M. Emile 
Boutmy's " Essai d'une Psychologie Politique 
da Peuple Anglais au XlXeme Siecle," M. 
Theodore Ruyssen's " Kant," M. Jean Finot's 
" Le Philosophic de la Longevite," M. G. 
Dumas's " La Tristesse et la Joie," and Mlle> 
Lucie Faure's "Newman and the Oxford 
Movement." M. Pravieux concludes his paper 
with the following remarks : 

" I can, at all events, attempt without undue temerity 
to discover the common tendency of writers of to-day. 
You meet, I think, almost everywhere an aversion to 
the conventional, the artificial, and a patient and per-

sistent search for nature, reality, and truth. Three 
writers, whose works in different degrees express this 
tendency, have left their mark on the living generation 
— Flaubert, Taine, Renan. Perhaps these three men 
will continue to influence the opening century. Perhaps 
their glory will be eclipsed by the arrival of some great 
genius who will open unexplored ways to the French 
spirit and will produce masterpieces. We must wait; 
it is for the future to speak." 

The report of German literature made by 
Dr. Heilborn is concerned almost wholly with 
the drama, the novel, and the poem. The 
various departments of scholarship are not 
represented at all, and the only books dis- 
cussed outside of belles-lettres are the " Jugen- 
derinnerungen " of Herr Heyse and Bismarck's 
" Briefe au Seine Braut uud Gattin." Dr. 
Heilborn opens with such general reflections 
as these : 

" The literary revolution which Germany experienced 
in the nineties directed the author only too vehemently 
to a diligent study of the external world. The contrary 
opinion is now gaining ground; it is only in self- 
communion that the artist can unlock his world. The 
power of moving the souls of others is granted only to 
that which the soul has itself experienced. A dim con- 
ception of this new yet immemorial truth is now assert- 
ing itself high and low in our literature, and points the 
way to new aims. Already we speak of a New Ro- 
manticism; but for the present that is merely a mean- 
ingless title for a newly awakened longing to which an 
adequate fulfilment has not yet been vouchsafed." 

Herr Hauptmann's " Michael Kramer," which 
has proved a failure on the stage, is thus 
characterized : 

" Father and son, both artists, stand opposed to each 
other in this drama; they divide the interest. The 
scanty action of the piece turns wholly on the son; he 
is ruined by his want of energy and by his paltry ex- 
cesses. The physical deformity which has accompanied 
his entrance into the world has made him malicious and 
cowardly, reticent and mendacious. As far as the dra- 
matic action is concerned, the father is a mere specta- 
tor, but psychologically he stands in the centre of the 
play. The death of his son affects him as a psychical 
experience; the majesty of death confronts him, and 
awakes in his bosom tones which have slumbered there 
for many a day; with this grief his being ripens towards 
its consummation. One feels that the play was written 
for the sake of this inner revelation; personal experi- 
ence is reflected in it and has taken shape perforce." 

Herr Rosmer's " Mutter Maria " is another 
subjective play, a " fairy poem " of striking 
originality. 

"It is a Song of Songs on motherhood; in its pages 
the mother's joy exults, the mother's anguish mourns. 
An ice-maiden who dances with her sisters on the snow- 
peaks of a glacier, has been discovered by a huntsman, 
who has held her in his embrace and thereby kissed her 
heart to life; he has fallen a prey to death as the 
result. Now she feels drawn towards the earth, and 
the sight of the Mother of God, hewn out of the rocks 
by a hermit, gives her the first presentiment of a new- 



born human perception. Death joins her on her journey 
towards the valley. She has to fight with him for the 
possession of her child when, solitary and forsaken, she 
sinks down by the wayside in the hour of giving birth; 
she overcomes him. The consecration of motherhood 
comes upon her, but at the same time there awakes in 
her bosom the old, defiant, pagan sentiment of revolt 
against God; the power of Nature, which, according to 
all the tradition of fable, knows naught of God, is 
strong within her." 

This is only a part of the story, the description 
is too long for full quotation. Of Herr Suder- 
mann's " Johannisfeuer " we read : 

"A young fellow who is betrothed to the squire's 
daughter feels himself passionately drawn towards a 
young girl whom this squire has out of pity taken into 
his own house and brought up as his own child. On 
the Eve of St. John the two, regardless of the vow they 
have taken, overstep the bounds of propriety, yield to 
their passion, and then — separate once more in a feeble 
resignation, she to fare abroad, he to return to his 
bride." 

In spite, however, of the power of these sub- 
jective and symbolic productions, the writer is 
constrained to admit that an objective piece, 
Herr Erich Hartleben's " Rosenmontag," has 
scored the greatest stage success of the year. 
Other plays of note are " Der Sieger," by Herr 
Max Dreyer ; " De Junge Goldner," by Herr 
Georg Hirschfeld ; " Der Tag," by Herr 
Stephan Vacano ; "Die Zwillingsschwester," 
by Herr Ludwig Fulda ; " Hockenjos," by 
Herr Jacob Wasserman ; and " Der Retter," 
by Herr Carlot Gottfried Reuling. It appears 
certain from the summary here presented that 
dramatic writing is now more than ever the 
vital form of German literary art, and that 
even France may soon have to look to her 
laurels in this field. In fiction, Frau von 
Ebner-Eschenbach's " Aus Spjitherbsttagen," 
a volume of short stories, is called " perhaps 
the most important appearance of the year." 
Next in importance is Herr Spielhagen's novel 
" Freigeboren," which " is perhaps his best 
work which he has given us — his most inti- 
mate book, at all events." Other works of 
fiction are " Die Geschichte der Jungen Renate 
Fuchs," by Herr Wassermann, (which makes 
one think of " Evelyn Innes ") ; " Der Tod 
Georg's," by Herr Beer-Hoffman; "Frau 
Bertha Garlan," by Herr Arthur Schnitzler ; 
Herr von Ompteda's " Monte Carlo," Herr 
von Polenz's " Liebe ist Ewig," and Frau Vie- 
big's "Das Tagliche Brot." Poetic energy in 
modern Germany is so absorbed by the stage 
that little is left for lyricism. The only volumes 
of verse that seem worth mentioning are the 
"Reigen " of Herr Hugo Salus, and the "Neues 
Leben " of Herr Karl Henckell.

UNCIVILIZED "Civilization."* 

Rarely or never does so much actuality creep 
into a history of any kind as Mr. A. Henry 
Savage Landor has incorporated in his account 
of the proceedings of European nations, aided 
by the United States and Japan, in China dur- 
ing the recent Boxer outbreak. With the best 
will in the world, few historians deal with such 
facts at first-hand and while they are still vivid 
in the memory. Writing in a closet, affairs 
take on another aspect, time is given for the 
working out of historical theories, and actuali- 
ties are made to conform to them as to the 
conventions and view-points of the age. Writ- 
ing as Mr. Landor writes, — himself an eye- 
witness, and in most cases, like ^neas. a part 
of what he describes, — the reader needs to do 
little besides make due allowance for the per- 
sonal equation, and the thing itself is within 
his grasp. 

Those who will read " China and the Allies " 
in the light furnished by the author's former 
book, "In a Forbidden Land," will find a large 
part of this personal equation already formu- 
lized. The rest of it may be pieced together 
from the pages of the latter book. A frank- 
ness of statement and an almost childlike reve- 
lation of likes and dislikes bear witness to Mr. 
Landor's education away from Saxon reticence 
and self-containment. He attributes the Boxer 
uprising wholly to what he calls the " Lamas " 
of China, the Buddhist priests of the nation. 
By attributing to these individuals all the evil 
qualities which human nature at its worst can 
take on, he contrives to throw the responsibility 
for Christian massacres and miseries wholly 
apon their shoulders. To make his point 
clearer, he refrains from dwelling on the provo- 
cations, in the way of land-grabbing and dis- 
regard of ancient superstitions, which, in the 
opinion of most thoughtful people, make the 
Boxer movement a national one, animated by 
the same sort of chauvinistic patriotism which 
is being cultivated so sedulously by the govern- 
ments of Europe and America. It seems cer- 
tain that, even were there such beings as 
Chinese '* Lamas," no preachings and pleas 
could have obtained so great a following for 
their anti-foteign ideas if there had not been 
fertile soil ready for the germination of the

seed he believes them to have sowed. In any 
event, travellers of authority, from the earliest 
days to so recent a book as Mr. Archibald 
Little's " Mount Omi and Beyond "(reviewed 
in The Dial of July 16 last), have borne 
abundant testimony to the radical differences 
between the Buddhism of China and the Lama- 
ism of Thibet and Mongolia, attributing to the 
Chinese priests professing belief in the doc- 
trines of Buddha a temperance in all things 
which contradicts Mr. Landor's sensational 
statements and more sensational drawings. It 
would almost seem that here he is wreaking 
vengeance for the miseries he was forced to 
undergo in Thibet. 

The blame attached to the " Lamas " for 
the uprising is borne in part, however, by Sir 
Claude Macdonald, British plenipotentiary at 
Peking, for not attaching sufficient importance 
to what Mr. Landor perceives to be significant 
premonitions of approaching trouble. The 
attack upon this diplomatist is so bitter that it 
leaves an impression of personal animus. It 
would be unfair to the author to aver that 
such is the case, but it is certainly true of other 
men in the book who receive excoriation at his 
hands, the proof being from his own pen. The 
sufferings of the missionaries, which are set 
forth in considerable detail, go to show that 
no European nor American in China foresaw 
the extent of the revolt against foreigners and 
their ideas, plain as the indications of them 
now appear to be. The charity extended to 
the missionaries might have been granted to 
Sir Claude, with advantage to the book. 

The first of the two large volumes which 
comprise the present work is taken up with 
the story of the march of the Allies to Peking. 
From its beginnings until Mr. Landor rode 
by the side of the Russian General Linievitch 
into the Forbidden City, the indefatigable his- 
torian was in the thick of everything, — on 
the firing line, with the looters, in the camps, 
at th€ head of the advancing column, always 
manifesting a ubiquity which must have been 
more than annoying to the commanders of the 
expedition. But it enabled the busy young 
man to secure photographs of actual scenes of 
plunder and carnage, which he reproduces here ; 
and war never saw its most hideous naked- 
nesses more boldly exposed, for civilization 
and Christianity to shudder over. The moral 
is as plain as that of the pictures of Mr. 
Verestchagin painted in the Philippines within 
the twelvemonth. 

The same characteristic which leads men, 



74 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



under the plea of patriotism, to conceal from 
the public eye things that need correction, has 
led to reports of looting on the march to Peking, 
in which each correspondent depicts his coun- 
trymen as blameless while all the other nations 
among the Allies were robbing the Chinese 
with both hands. This pot-and-kettle pro- 
cedure does not avail with Mr. Landor, whose 
words become the more authoritative because 
he enters upon a general justification of all 
looting in the campaign, wherever prevailing 
and under whose hands soever. With satire 
wholly unintended, he even goes so far as to 
differentiate the various tastes in loot shown 
by the assembled Christians and Japanese. 
The French, it appears, desired food more 
than anything; the Japanese, bric-abrac; the 
Germans, substantial articles of many sorts ; 
the Russians, anything they could get their 
hands on ; the British Indians, fine textiles 
and embroideries ; and the Americans, gold 
and silver in lumps. The Americans, he avers, 
were the untidiest robbers of the crowd, picking 
up perhaps a priceless bit of porcelain and 
dropping it to the floor rather than make the 
exertion of replacing it on its shelf. Russians, 
the soldiers we place lowest in the scale of 
general intelligence, and Americans, the sol- 
diers we place highest, were the most complete 
devastators of goods and property of all sorts 
at Tientsin, where most of the plunder was 
secured. But here, as elsewhere, Mr. Landor 
clears the skirts of the Russians from the 
charges of indiscriminate cruelty to natives 
made by correspondents of other nations. His 
words would bear more weight if he had not 
received the notable favor from the Russian 
commander which made him the first English- 
speaking person to set foot in the Forbidden 
City of Peking, just as his charges against 
the American General Chaffee would bear 
more weight if that officer had not refused 
him the same privilege. 

The second volume is occupied with a day- 
by-day account of those beleaguered men and 
women in Peking whose sufferings were so 
acute and were borne with such sturdiness 
through the dismal weeks while the Allies 
were fighting their way onward. This, of 
course, is compiled from the accounts of others 
rather than given at first-hand ; but it bears 
evidences of thoroughness, and is not less in- 
teresting than the story of the march, though 
equally unpolished. Mr. Landor pauses to 
wonder how it could be possible for the news- 
papers of Europe and America to blazon 



abroad the death of the German Minister, 
Baron von Keteler, on June 16, 1900, when 
his actual assassination did not take place until 
June 20, four long days afterward. The orig- 
inal news, Mr. Landor says, was sent out from 
Shanghai or Chefoo, and evidences a con- 
spiracy which was not put into execution until 
later. It seems more likely that the story 
emanated from the city of Chicago, and was 
born, like the account of the Russian de Giers's 
death by boiling in oil, in the brain of an 
imaginative newspaper writer named Charles 
Douglas Almy, formerly in the American Navy, 
and stationed in Chinese waters. 

Mr. Landor's book, large as it would have 
been if no extraneous matter had been included, 
contains a long account of his travels in China 
ten years ago, in the first volume, and an 
equally long history of the Ming dynasty, in 
the second. These portions, like the others, 
are wholly lacking in what is usually called 
style, but possess rugged force and unques- 
tionable interest nevertheless. The best chap- 
ter of all in point of picturesqueness and vigor, 
is given up to an account of the American 
assault on the gates of the Forbidden City. 
To the American soldiery is given credit for 
personal intelligence and valor, but for nothing 
else ; and in spite of the strong Russian pre- 
possession noted, the Japanese bear away the 
palm for soldierly bearing, general efficiency, 
and discipline, — everything in short which 
goes to make up " civilization " in its belliger- 
ent and least lovely aspect.

The Family of Shakespeare.* 



With all the pains in the world, doubtless 
we never shall be able to " account " for genius 
in any shallow sense. Yet the modern scien- 
tific spirit, with " heredity " and " environ- 
ment " for its chief con jure- words, demands of 
biography that it shall give us every minutest 
detail, not only of the life of the genius him- 
self, but of his ancestors, collaterals, and sur- 
roundings of whatever nature. Formerly, a 
few lines and mere dates sufficed as history of 
parentage. Now, we are not surprised when 
we are offered large volumes tracing a man's 
pedigree in all possible ramifications, and his 
environment in every smallest particular. 
Moreover, the kind of evidence admitted has

changed entirely. Formerly, gossip and tra- 
dition, with liberal use of the imagination in 
making deductions, if they succeeded in work- 
ing up a life-like and " readable " tale, were 
not too closely scanned or investigated. Now, 
nothing is taken on trust, but all must be based 
on documentary evidence, with copious foot- 
notes for verification. 

Perhaps the most striking illustration of this 
change is furnished by the history of Shakes- 
peare biography. For two hundred and twenty- 
five years after the poet's death, his dozens of 
biographers, from Nicholas Rowe to Charles 
Knight, accepted the Stratford gossip collected 
by Betterton three-quarters of a century after 
Shakespeare had been laid in his grave, and 
derived from it more or less conceivable ac- 
counts of what might have happened, what he 
probably did, the people he was likely to have 
known, etc. This went on until about fifty 
years ago, when Halliwell-Phillips, ignoring 
the previous accumulation of hearsay and im- 
agination, issued a " Life " based on document- 
ary evidence of various kinds, chiefly registers 
of births, deaths, baptisms, wills, mortgages, 
and the like. Since that new departure, the 
trend has all been along the same line, until 
now we have an octavo volume of 250 pages 
devoted to " Shakespeare's Family," of which 
only about twenty-five pages- have to do with 
the man William Shakespeare. Only a con- 
firmed Dryasdust would apply the word " read- 
able " to this work, yet every Shakespeare 
student will wish to have it in his library as a 
reference volume. There is almost no allusion 
to the plays and poems which Shakespeare 
wrote ; it is in no sense a literary biography. 
Any expectations of this kind are banished by 
the Preface, wherein the author states : " It is 
only the genealogical details of certain War- 
wickshire families of which I now treat, and 
it is only as an interesting Warwickshire gen- 
tleman that the poet is here included." 

Chief among these families, naturally, are 
the Shakespeares and the Ardens ; but there 
is also much interesting matter relating to the 
Hathaways, the Quinceys, the Halls, and vari- 
ous cousins and connections. The origin of the 
name Shakespeare itself, though hidden in the 
mists of antiquity, is held to have been con- 
ferred in the first place for valor in feats of 
arms, and Spenser is quoted in proof that it 
was so understood by his contemporaries. See- 
ing that no other poet of his time had an 
"heroic name," doubtless the allusion in 
" Colin Clout's Come Home Again " — 



" Whose Muse, full of high thought's invention. 
Doth like himself heroically sound," — 

refers to Shakespeare. 

As to the much-disputed spelling of the 
name, the author adopts " Shakespere " for 
the early families of the period when spear was 
spelt " spere"; and "Shakespeare " when spear 
was spelt " speare," as it was in the sixteenth 
century. Moreover, this latter form was the 
Court spelling of the period, as shown by the 
first official record of the name ; and it was also 
the spelling suffered to pass by the author him- 
self in correcting the proofs of the " first heirs 
of his invention," in 1593 and 1594. The fact 
that Shakespeare himself sometimes varied, 
counted for little then. He might have held 
romantically to the quainter spelling of the 
olden time, as did many others, such as 
" Duddeley," " Crumwell," " Elmer." 

Conclusive evidence is brought to show that 
by the Spear-side the poet's family was at 
least respectable, and that by the Spindle-side 
his pedigree can be traced straight back to 
Guy of Warwick and the good King Alfred. 
For the chief original discovery claimed by 
our author is that she has found at last a defi- 
nite link of association between the Park Hall 
Ardens and the Wilmcote Ardens, and hence 
that the descent of Shakespeare on his mother's 
side is from one of the most nationally interest- 
ing of all English families. Great Norman 
families who " came in with the Conqueror " 
are numerous enough, but there are few that 
claim to be " merely English " who have such 
a record to show as the Ardens. 

The first noble victim of the tyrannical 
Royal Commission of 1583 was Edward Arden, 
Sheriff of his county in 1575. Whether or 
not, as the author suggests, " it is more than 
probable that the active part that Sir Thomas 
Lucy took in the arrest of Arden told more 
on the fortunes and feelings of young Shake- 
speare than the fabulous deer-stealing story," 
certainly the circumstances were sufficiently 
touching and tragic to have made a powerful 
impression on a sensitive youth of nineteen. 
Although the victim is praised by contemporary 
writers and was pitied by all Europe, Froude 
and other historians have given small space 
to the cruel story. Our author condenses the 
account from the State Papers thus : 

" Edward Arden seems to have been highly respected, 
but he had offended Leicester by refusing to wear his 
livery (as many of the gentlemen of the county were 
proud to do) and by disapproving openly of his rela- 
tions with the Countess of Essex before her husband's 
death. Leicester waited his time. . . . Edward Arden

was a temperate follower of the old faith; but his son- 
in-law, John Somerville, an excitable youth, seemed 
to chafe under the increasing oppression of the Catholic 
Church and its adherents. The evil reports concerning 
the Queen and Leicester increased the friction. Shut 
out from travel or active exercise, as all Catholics then 
were by law, his mind seems to have given way in his 
sleepless attempts to reconcile faith and practice. He 
started off suddenly one morning before anyone was 
awake, and at the inns on the road spoke frantically 
to all who chose to hear, saying he was going to London 
to kill the Queen. Arrest, examination, imprisonment 
in the Tower followed. Thereafter went forth the 
mandate to arrest Edward Ardeu, his wife, and his 
brother, Somerville's wife and sister, and his wife's 
grand-uncle. Examinations, probably under torture, 
followed fast on each other, and John Somerville and 
the Ardens were found guilty and condemned to the 
traitor's death. On December 19, 1583, Somerville 
and Arden were carried forth from the Tower to 
Newgate, in preparation for their execution on the 
morrow; Somerville was found two hours afterwards 
strangled in his cell; Edward Arden suffered the full 
penalty of the law December 20, 1583. Robert of 
Leicester had his revenge. Mrs. Arden and Francis,

ment, and then to have been released. . . . The traitor's

The book makes some attempt to solve the 
mystery of Shakespeare's occupations during 
those years of his early manhood when he 
went up to London seeking to make a place 
for himself. But nothing new seems to have 
been discovered, and all is still surmise, with 
a probability that his first firm step on the 
staircase of fame was taken in the publication 
of Shakespeare's " Venus and Adonis," by his 
old Stratford friend, Richard Field, in 1593, 
and his first grip of success in his dedication 
thereof to the young Earl of Southampton. 

The volume has fifteen illustrations, most of 
them familiar, but forever charming, since 
they are reproductions of such picturesqueness 
as the old Arden house at Wilmcote, Anne 
Hathaway 's cottage at Shottery, the Snitter- 
field Church, and Warwick Castle.

On Celtic Folklore.* 



The position of the Celtic-speaking peoples 
and their influence on the life and letters of 
England and Scotland are beginning to be duly 
appreciated. The student of English literature, 
for example, now understands that he cannot 
comprehend the informing spirit of that liter- 
ature without knowing something of the races 
which the Teuton found in Britain, and with

which, probably, in some degree, he must share 
the glory of English achievement. And for 
this knowledge he must resort to the anthro- 
pologist and the folklorist, who, fortunately, 
have not been idle. 

In Professor Rhys's handsome volumes we 
have an invaluable collection of materials for 
the study of Celtic folklore, together with a 
discussion of some of the important questions 
connected with the subject, from one whose 
knowledge gives his words great weight, the 
professor of Celtic at Oxford. No consider- 
able publication on the subject of Welsh folk- 
lore has appeared since the modest volume of 
the late Rev. Elias Owen (" Welsh Folk-lore, 
a Collection of the Folk-tales and Legends of 
North Wales"), published in 1896. In this 
volume Mr. Owen confined himself to the 
fairies, stories of Satan, ghosts, witches, con- 
jurors, charms, omens, " spiritualism," death 
portents, and birds and beasts ; reserving the 
holy wells for a later volume which he was 
destined never to publish. Professor Rhys has 
restricted himself still more narrowly. He deals 
in the main only with the fairies and their 
kindred, witches and magic, the calendar, holy 
wells, the belief in submerged cities, cave- 
legends, and place-name stories. His material 
he has drawn from all over Wales, but princi- 
pally from the western counties of Carnarvon, 
Merioneth, and Cardigan. Flint and Radnor 
contribute nothing, and to Montgomery he 
owes only a reference to Owen's book concern- 
ing the corpse candle. Mr. Rhys believes, 
however, that if the other counties were to be 
worked as thoroughly as Carnarvon has been, 
the results would be almost as rich ; the angli- 
cising counties have hitherto been disregarded 
from both Welsh and English points of view. 
Let us hope this theory will prove correct. 

Although Mr. Rhys began collecting folk- 
lore more than twenty years ago, he has had 
cause to regret that he did not begin sooner. 
In many instances he could get only scraps of 
stories which it took him years to learn how 
to piece together. The causes of the disap- 
pearance of folklore from the principality have 
been interestingly discussed by Mr. Hartland 
in his introduction to " English Fairy and 
Other Folk Tales." In view of all the causes 
that have operated in Wales to root out the 
old beliefs, we are inclined to consider the 
present collection reasonably large. 

The chief obvious fault of this work is its 
inconsistent arrangement, partly by correspond- 
ents rather than by topics : a defect due to the 



1901.]

manner in which the book grew. Portions of 
the material appeared several years ago in the 
publications of the Cymmrodorion and Folk- 
lore Societies ; and when the author came to 
re-arrange these papers for the present work, 
his materials had been greatly augmented, and 
he found that to re-cast the whole properly 
would require more time than he could then 
give. This drawback, however, we are glad to 
find has not kept him from issuing the complete 
work, which a full index renders usable. 

A large part of the work is given up to the 
fairies, " the richest lode to be explored in the 
mine of Celtic folklore." The fairies largely 
originated, the author concludes, " in the 
demons and divinities, not all of ancestral 
origin, with which the weird fancy of our re- 
mote forefathers peopled lakes and streams, 
bays and creeks and estuaries." Mr. Rhys 
certainly makes out a strong case for this 
theory, in demonstrating the close connection 
of the fairies with rivers, green isles, the 
marshes, and the mountain mist. He is not 
blind, however, to the fact that the water- 
divinities cannot be the fairies' only ancestors. 
The fair water-goddesses can have little in 
common with the short, swarthy, " stumpy 
men, occupying the most inaccessible dis- 
tricts " ; and any theory which postulates a 
common ancestor for the Lady of the Van Pool 
and the thieving red fairies of Merionethshire 
is to be regarded with suspicion. Mr. Rhys 
might perhaps have brought out more sharply 
than he has done the distinction between the 
fairies proper and the elves. It is really the 
elves whose ancestors are searched for in the 
discussion of race questions arising in connec- 
tion with fairy lore. In the swarthy fairies 
Mr. Rhys sees the lowest stratum of the primi- 
tive population to which we can reach — a 
dwarf race, possibly kindred to that found in 
Sicily. They were superseded by the Picts, of 
Libyan or possibly Iberian affinities, to which 
probably belonged the great family groups of 
the Mabinogion and corresponding Irish tales. 
This race in turn yielded to and probably 
amalgamated with the invading Goidelic and 
later Brythonic Celts. These, however, are 
only conjectures which Mr. Rhys thinks may 
be established in the future. 

In the chapter on cave-legends, also, Pro- 
fessor Rhys returns to a favorite subject, the 
Arthurian story, pointing out that Welsh folk- 
lore represents Arthur as passing in Faery the 
time which must elapse before his return. Lack 
of space forbids mention of many other inter- 



esting points. The book furnishes another 
good example of the light which folk-tales and 
beliefs under the analysis of a trained mind 
can be made to throw on the early ages of the 
world. Clark Sutherland Northup. 



The Tribulations of a Princess.* 

It is now some two years since " The Mar- 
tyrdom of an Empress," with its curiously 
intimate reminiscences of the hapless Elizabeth 
of Austria, created so widespread an interest 
both in America and England. Speculation 
regarding the authorship and consequent au- 
thenticity of this memoir, rife at the time of 
its publication, will be revived by the anony- 
mous author's recent venture, " The Tribula- 
tions of a Princess." The publishers announce 
that the new book is autobiography ; but it is 
doubtful whether or not its thrilling narrative 
furnishes any solution, save that of a dilemma, 
for the problem of " who 's who." For if we 
assume that the author is the grande dame of 
her story, five of whose portraits embellish the 
book, then half Europe should recognize her, 
and the secret of her identity, which she has 
naturally been so careful to guard, is, or will 
soon be, an open one. So this theory seems 
untenable, though the strongly-drawn person^ 
ality of the princess, and the easy and familiar 
style in which her life-story is recounted, lend 
considerable color to its hypothesis. If, again, 
we regard the autobiography as wholly or in 
large part a fabrication, then of course all 
comment upon the relation between this and 
the earlier work is superfluous. 

And it is surely not as a mere side-light 
upon the other volume that " The Tribulations 
of a Princess " should be considered. To begin 
with, this book is far better written than the 
other. The rather prolix newspapery style of 
the Empress's biography has been abandoned, 
and the narrative moves on in a rapid, telling 
fashion, which becomes a bit too theatrical 
occasionally, and is badly marred through the 
first half of the story by the introduction of 
much gratuitous French. In " The Martyr- 
dom of an Empress" the interest centred 
wholly in the unique if questionable value of 
the material. The same effect is repeated here, 
though it is only casually that the Czar or the 
Empress enters — only occa sionally that the

reader with a taste for history sugar-coated 
with couversation can gratify his longing. The 
present critic belongs, it may as well be con- 
fessed, to the other party, to whom it is a relief 
that here for the most part the skeleton of un- 
signed history (" How much of this is only 
gossip of the antechamber ? ") may be locked 
safely out of sight, and that we have merely a 
rapid and well-sustained narrative of Austrian 
and Russian court-life, which, according to his 
taste and as he weighs the evidence, the reader 
may regard seriously as strict fact or more 
lightly as fiction, with little to gain or lose 
either way. 

For in either case the Princess Marguerite 
— known as " Muzzi " to her Austrian and 
Russian friends, including the Czar — is cer- 
tainly a fascinating personage who can look 
back upon a very eventful career. Her early 
life is passed in a chateau in Basse-Bretagne, 
where, after nine years of joyous, outdoor life, 
in close comradeship with her father whom she 
adores, she is suddenly informed by her tyran- 
nical Russian mother that she is a girl, and 
not, as she has always supposed, a boy. So 
Pierrot becomes Marguerite, to her own, and 
somewhat also to the reader's, bewilderment. 
This change and her father's death are her 
first great sorrows, both terribly enhanced by 
her mother's cruelly abrupt fashion of an- 
nouncing them. 

This mother is the bad angel of the chron- 
icle, the dominating figure of its first part. 

" Talented, witty, with that sharp, caustic, merciless 
wit which often cuts like the lash of a whip, she was 
singularly entertaining and clever, and yet somehow I 
never felt easy when I was with her, and I avoided her 
as much as possible. . . . Yet I admired her deeply a 
distance, and used to be very proud when I heard com- 
plimentary remarks made about the perfection of her 
tea-rose skin, her flashing black eyes, and her long 
raven hair." 

This is the point of view of the child Pierrot, 
which changes first to a more firmly grounded 
distrust of the merciless and malicious beauty, 
and finally to bitter hatred and absolute es- 
trangement, after the full perfidy of her moth- 
er's conduct in forcing her to marry an Austrian 
prince, twenty-one years her senior, whom she 
justly hates, dawns upon the sixteen-year-old 
Marguerite. 

It is from this experience that the young prin- 
cess gets her cynical abhorence of all women 
save the Empress Elizabeth, whom she meets 
through her Austrian marriage, and who be- 
comes her only confidante. In spite of a dis- 
parity of years, there are many ties between 



them — their love of horses and of the hunt, 
of the sea, the mountains, and the country, the 
bitter experience that came to each in youth, 
and the indomitable courage with which each is 
bound to front the world and cheat it if may be. 
A characteristic little scene between the two 
takes place one morning when " Muzzi " has 
been disciplining an unruly steeple-chaser. 
The Empress rides up just in time to applaud 
her victory over the obstinate brute. 

** ' This is a very high-spirited horse,' I said, laugh- 
ing a little, well pleased with such praise, ' but he is 
not really bad. . . . He understands every word one 
says.' 

" It was her turn to laugh. « Get off, little one. I 
am going to have a try myself,' she added, slipping 
from her saddle with that inimitable and exquisite 
grace of movement which was all her own. 

"'Oh, don't, please,' I cried impulsively; 'he is 
dangerous sometimes, and what a thousand shames it 
would be if he were to mangle you ! ' 

" « How about yourself, then, Muzzi ? Would it not 
be a shame, too ? ' she remarked tentatively, laying her 
narrow, slightly tanned hand on ' The Chief's ' mane. 

" ' I would be glad if he did,' I said, impulsively. 

" The Empress looked at me wistfully, but she said 
nothing, and with a shrug of my shoulders I jumped 
down, and held out my hand for the reins of the superb 
hunter from which she had just dismounted." 

It is such perfect understanding and silent 
sympathy as this that wins the heart of the 
unhappy Xou°& exile. 

Her love of lonely out-door life stands her 
in good stead when, soon after her marriage, 
she goes into camp with her husband on the 
desolate Austrian frontier. One day she 
absent-mindedly rides across the boundary, 
and is pursued by a fierce band of Cossacks, 
whom she escapes by making a fearful jump 
over a stream which forms the boundary-line. 
A day or so later, as she is dining out, a 
Cossack officer, " not dreaming of course that 
the heroine thereof was sitting across the table 
from him," tells the story. He concludes his 
recital laughingly by saying : 

" ' My men were quite staggered when they saw that 
pretty she-devil fly across the river as if both herself 
and her marvellous steed were endowed with wings. 
... I myself would give much to know who this little 
imp of Satan was.'" 

" I was that imp. General ! " mischievously 
announces Muzzi ; and the laugh is on the 
amazed officer. 

Another of Muzzi's thrilling escapades is 
the mission she undertakes to St. Petersburg, 
to secure the release of an innocent man from 
Siberia. In her excitement she informs the 
Czar of all the Russias that he " must do 
something " for her protege.

" • Must f ' said the autocrat, drawing himself up and

The princess is angry too, but a moment later 
she sees the ludicrousness of the situation and 
succeeds in making the Czar see it too, so 
effectively that she and her servant are soon 
driving through the unbearable cold of a 
Siberian winter, carrying the Czar's release 
for the convict. 

During all the years of her marriage with 
Prince Karl, the princess is genuinely miser- 
able, in spite of the gay round of pleasure and 
excitement in which she lives. At last Karl 
falls in a disgraceful duel, leaving her free to 
marry a young Englishman. At this point

Cheyxe'8 Excycl,op,5:dia Biblica.* 



The second volume of Professor Cheyne's 
great Bible dictionary has followed promptly 
at the end of one year. The general plan and 
purpose of the Encyclopaedia was fully stated 
in a review of Vol. I. in The Dial of March 
1, 1900. The editors have varied slightly 
from the original plan, namely, to give an ex- 
position of the " advanced criticism " of the 
day. The second volume's advance over its 
predecessor is in the direction of a still more 
radical position on many critical and doctrinal 
questions. 

Dr. Cheyne's scholarship and literary skill 
have moulded the entire volume. Of the 559 
signed articles, he wrote all of 322, and parts 
of 47 others. These facts are ample proof 
of the critical ability and scholarship that 
stamps the work. His versatility is seen in 
the range of themes on which he writes, rang- 
ing from " Iron " to " Faith," from *• Jero- 
,boam " to " John the Baptist " and " Judas." 
His straightforward, bold method of treating 
the text, his freedom to amend and change 
such readings as seem necessary to his critical 
judgment, are everywhere apparent. The 
opinion of others is respected, but Dr. Cheyne 
as editor does not neglect to give utterance to 
the latest and most-advanced position on each 
theme treated.

Black, M.A., LL.D, Volume IL, E. to K. New York:

Some of the most notable articles in the 
present volume are " Egypt " by W. Max 
Miiller, " Eschatology " by R. H. Charles, 
" Gospels " by P. W. Schmiedel, " Israel " 
by H. Guthe, " Jerusalem " by G. A. and W. 
R. Smith and C. R. Conder, and " John Son 
of Zebedee " by P. W. Schmiedel. The two 
articles, *' Egypt " and " Jerusalem," are espe- 
cially valuable from the historical and geo- 
graphical point of view. They give us the 
latest researches, and each is accompanied with 
a fine colored map — a most welcome aid in a 
book like this. 

The longest article in the volume is " Gos- 
pels," covering 137 columns, or more than 68 
pages, by Prof. Schmiedel of the University 
of Zurich, Switzerland. This article is very 
exhaustive. The author discusses the synoptic 
problem with great ability, but his premises and 
methods of reasoning will arouse sharp antag- 
onism. He proceeds on an assumption (col. 
1872) that from the outset would practically 
rule out the credibility of the gospels. The 
chronological matter is worthless, and the testi- 
mony of Christ's disciples on the basis of the 
premise laid down above is always suspicions. 
But he does find nine passages which are 
credible, " which might be called the founda- 
tion pillars for a truly scientific life of Jesus " 
(§ 139). His scientific life, from the drift and 
open statements of the article, would make him 
an extraordinary man, whom tradition has dei- 
fied and worshipped. The article on Jesus by 
the late Prof. O. B. Bruce occupies but twenty 
columns, or ten pages, and is too brief. Its 
tenor is too ambiguous ; the author neither 
occupies the radical position of " Gospels," nor 
that of the same article in Hastings's " Diction- 
ary of the Bible." 

One of the most useful aids to the Bible 
student offered in this volume is the superior 
grade of maps inserted in their proper places. 
These are elegantly executed and brought 
strictly up-to-date. 

The " Encyclopaedia Biblica " may not prop- 
erly be termed a dictionary of the Bible, but a 
register of the most advanced criticism of the 
day as set forth by Swiss, German, Dutch, 
British, and American scholars. This is now 
the established sphere of this work, rather 
than that of setting forth the consensus of 
progressive scholarship on all topics that are 
of value and interest in the study of the 
Scriptures.

Briefs on New Books. 



The name of Mr. Martin A. S. 
Sp^nthpfoX Hume has already become familiar 

to the readers of popular history as 
a contributor to those publications which, issued in 
the form of a series, purport to supply historical 
information especially arranged for the general 
public. In 1897 he wrote a life of Raleigh for the 
" Builders of Greater Britain " series ; last year 
appeared his " Modern Spain " in the " Stories of 
the Nations," and now he comes forward again as 
the author of the first volume in a " Great Peoples " 
series (Appleton). The only novelty claimed 
for this new enterprise by the editor, Mr. York 
Powell, is that the various numbers are to be writ- 
ten by experts ; not by men of mere literary gifts, 
comparatively unfamiliar with the topics assigned 
them. This is a back-handed and seemingly unjust 
aspersion upon other similar series, and it remains 
to be seen whether the result shall justify the se- 
lection of the expert, for the editor disclaims for 
the series any intention of supplying exact history. 
It is, he says, " not so much a set of political or 
military or even social histories, as a sequence of 
readable studies on the tendencies and potencies of 
the chief peoples of the world." If this is the pur- 
pose, the publication of Mr. Hume's " The Spanish 
People " as the initiatory volume was not judicious. 
Mr. Hume is unquestionably a careful student, 
thoroughly familiar with the field in which he 
labors, but he is writing too much and too rapidly. 
His " Raleigh " showed discrimination, and con- 
tained some new matter on the trial and execution 
of his hero; his "Modern Spain" was without 
question a hurried labor indifferently performed ; 
while this last volume, though it gives evidence of 
the author's knowledge and research, is on the 
whole less suited to the purpose of a popular series 
than was either of the other two. Mr. Hume un- 
derstands, perhaps better than any other modern 
writer in English, the causes of Spanish develop- 
ment and decline. He appreciates the supreme 
importance of geographical and ethnological char- 
acteristics, without a knowledge of which the history 
of Spain is but a confused jumble of unreasonable 
contentions. He insists with truth that it was the 
individuality of diverse races in separate localities 
which gave to Spain the power and splendor of 
magnificent achievement under the direction of a 
wise government. He exhibits the Inquisition as, 
in the beginning, a creative, not a destructive, in- 
stitution, essentially popular with the masses, and 
working in harmony with individual initiative. 
Religious fanaticism was, in fact, as great a cause 
of national development in Spain as in England ; 
but, unfortunately for Spain, the Inquisition ulti- 
mately destroyed its ally and became the tool of a 
despotic government. Mr. Hume states these ideas, 
but states them piecemeal, in separated chapters 
and paragraphs, in the midst of a mass of weari- 
some details of the petty political mancevures, as- 



T/iree great

sassinations, poisonings, or intrigues, with which 
Spanish history is replete, and the condensed re- 
counting of which serves only to confuse and weary 
the mind of the reader. The progress and develop- 
ment of the Spanish people are so brought out that 
the careful reader, with labored effort, may achieve 
a correct conception ; but the mass of detail and 
incident preclude a clear impression for the average 
reader. The author states that he has not written 
a history, but a general survey ; yet the text denies 
the promise of the preface. " The Spanish People " 
is essentially condensed history, accurate but un- 
interesting. Mr. Hume is an expert in the sense 
of the editor's announcement ; but a just criticism 
of this work must emphasize the fact that another 
form of expert ability is also essential in the writing 
of a work primarily intended for popular reading. 

At a time when Americans seem 
more than usually disposed to forget 
that they have a past from which 
the highest ideals ever known to a sovereign people 
are to be derived, the publication of three volumes 
in the "Riverside Biographical Series" (Hough- 
ton), standing for as many phases of our national 
development, assumes educational importance. The 
volume on William Penn is by Mr. George Hodges, 
who within his ratlier contracted limits contrives 
to paint a firm and well-realized portrait of a man 
whose example Americans have never departed 
from without harm. Penn dealt justly with the 
Indians, and was rewarded by their affection, re- 
spect, and fidelity. Most of all he was the first to 
announce the broadest principles of civil and reli- 
gious liberty in the organic acts he prepared for 
the government of Pennsylvania, a step in advance 
which his successors have yet to bring to perfect 
fruition. Penn is clearly seen as a religious zealot 
who tempered his principles by participation in 
politics, thereby extending the influence of those 
principles far beyond the sphere of his personal 
influence. He was loyal to his friends, and never 
thought them wrong, suffering rather all his life 
for the preservation of his ideals. — Mr. Henry 
Childs Merwin, in his sketch of Thomas Jefferson, 
has given the world a brief and fully sympathetic 
account of that great statesman which is free from 
adoration on one side and rancour toward Hamilton 
and his followers on the other. Perhaps the final 
test of any writer's comprehension of Jefferaonian 
principles is made by the acceptance of his polity 
that government should always stand in moral fear 
of the governed ; and here Mr. Merwin does not 
waver. He is free to criticize Jefferson both politi- 
cally and personally, following a useful precedent 
which has left the author of the Declaration the 
most human figure among the Fathers of the Re- 
public ; but his fine comprehension of the man and 
his acceptance of the doctrine of self-government 
make the book an illuminating one. Interesting 
at the present time is the first declaration of the 
policy known as the Monroe Doctrine, showing it

to have limitations upon America as well as upon 
Europe in the phrase declaring the need for " a 
meridian ... on the hither side of which no 
European gun shall ever be heard, nor an Ameri- 
can on the other." — The volume on Peter Cooper, 
by Mr. Rossiter "W. Raymond, lacks the sympathy 
for the political principles peculiar to its subject, 
notable in its predecessors ; but this is the only 
omission to be complained of. Peter Cooper stands 
to-day as the American most noted for his intelli- 
gent benefactions to the cause of education, and 
the reason is made clear by his biographer. In 
giving, he did not deprive himself of a little of his 
substance, retaining more than sufficed for his needs, 
but rather pinched himself to give, — accumulating 
by piecemeal, for example, the property on which 
the Cooper Union now stands. — in order to make 
his gift as efficacious as possible. Penn stands as 
the democrat of the colonial, Jefferson of the early 
national, and Cooper of the first great commercial 
epoch in American history ; and all represent a 
vital and moving force and sympathy, without which 
the New World were the mere appanage, morally 
and socially, of the Old. 

The series on " Great Masters in 
Painting and Sculpture " (Macmil- 
lan) has now reached the number of 
fifteen volumes. They are of very unequal merit. 
No one of them is without value : the great number 
of illustrations, the careful catalogue of works 
arranged according to galleries, the lists of dates 
and documents, — these and one or two other fea- 
tures will always make them useful handbooks. For 
general convenience they seem to us to be rather 
superior to the Knackf uss series of Kiinstler-Mono- 
graphieu, some numbers of which have been trans- 
lated. The Knackfuss books have more illustrations 
as a rule, and cost less money ; but their arrange- 
ment is not so convenient, certainly for purposes of 
reference. So the present series is one which an 
art-student will want to have. Some of the volumes 
are excellent, as, for example, Mr. Stevenson's 
monograph on Velasquez, which we noticed some 
time ago. But other volumes are clearly not up to 
the mark, — for instance, the volume on Luca della 
Robbia by the Marchesa Barlamacchi, which ap- 
pears to us to lack any real appreciation of Delia 
Robbia as it certainly lacks any excellence in pre- 
sentation. It is not clearly conceived, and it is 
expressed in very poor English. The cause of the 
latter failing may perhaps be that the lady is an 
Italian, — we know nothing to the contrary, — but 
even if this is the case, an English editor should 
have been careful to make the text comprehensible 
at a first reading. Somewhat more satisfactory, 
certainly better written, is the volume on Sodoma 
by the Contessa Prinli-Bon. Dr. "Williamson, the 
editor of the series, has been more successful in his 
own books than in some of the others. The second 
of his own volumes, that on Perugino, appears to 
be quite as good as the one on Luini. Neither is 



of the highest kind of art criticism, for neither 
arouses much interest ; but both are of a kind very 
useful to the art-student who has gained elsewhere 
enthusiasm and appreciation of bis subject. More 
interesting on the whole, and not less critical, is the 
volume on Pintoriccio by Mr. E. March Phillips. 
The subject is not especially fascinating, but it is 
so handled that we regret the author had not more 
important material. 

Mr. A. B. Walkley, the author of 
^J^^^/ZL^ "Frames of Mind" (published in 

England two years ago, and now 
imported by M. F. Mansfield & Co.), is not unknown 
in this country, chiefly as one interested in what 
may be called new developments in literature. He 
furnished, for instance, an introduction to the trans- 
lation of Maeterlinck's " Treasure of the Humble." 
His " Frames of Mind," so far as this book records 
them, are mostly, though not all, induced by books 
and plays. We have, for example, short essays 
(the book is a collection of work already published) 
on Pinero, and Bernard Shaw, and Mrs. Craigie 
as a dramatist ; on Forbes Robertson's " Hamlet," 
and Sarah Bernhardt's ; and notes on Anatole 
France in his "Histoire Contemporaine," and on 
Maeterlinck's " Wisdom and Destiny." Not that 
Mr. Walkley neglects older work, — he is a good 
deal interested in Dr. Johnson, — nor that his 
" Frames of Mind " are all literary, for not a few 
of them are reminiscences of holiday and travel. 
His book is amusing to one who is interested in the 
things he writes about, although he cannot exactly 
be said either to strike any " new note " or to pre- 
serve the staid conventionality of the critical essay. 
These bits are the light-hearted and light-handed 
weekly writing for the newspaper of which there 
is so much nowadays, though not all of it is as good 
AS this. Now and then one comes across a good 
idea, although it is apt to belong to the thing dealt 
with rather than to the dealing with it, — as in the 
conception of " Hamlet " as the curious, inquiring 
man of the Renaissance. Still, Mr. Walkley is by 
no means without ideas, and his turning about 
of current literary themes may occupy a summer 
hour very pleasantly. 

The tpeecku '^^® volume of *' Speeches and Ad- 

andaddnue* dresses " by D. M. Delmas, Esquire, 
0/ a lawyer. q£ g^^ Francisco, is made up of 

arguments in the courts of California ; addresses 
on various public occasions, educational, political, 
and literary ; and at least one speech of more than 
usual power, delivered at Santa Cruz on the day 
before the last Presidential election, in which radical 
ground is taken against the imperialistic policy of 
the present administration. The speech evinces 
careful preparation, and is in a sense a classic upon 
that still burning question of political ethics and 
policy. One of the interesting legal questions con- 
sidered by Mr. Delmas was, whether a court has 
the power to make and enforce an order forbidding

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



the publication of the proceedings of a trial pend- 
ing before it. He contended that it had not, and 
was sustained in this position by the Supreme 
Court of California. The case is fully reported in 
Volume 99 of the California Reports. His descrip- 
tion of a political " boss " before a jury is especially 
scathing, and his eulogy of the late United States 
Senator White is an eloquent tribute to an eminent 
statesman of the Pacific slope. The " Speeches and 
Addresses," of which there are sixteen, show the 
author to be a lawyer of more than average ability, 
and to possess the power of oratory in a marked 
degree. His utterances are well worthy of preser- 
vation in this permanent form. The volume con- 
tains a good portrait of the author, and is published 
by A. M. Robertson, San Francisco. 

An artless book, but one that con- 
ifSJoi^ia. ^eys a vivid impression of life among 

Western college students, has been 
written by Mr. Joy Lichtenstein with the title, 
" For the Blue and Gold : A Tale of Life at the 
University of California " (A. M. Robertson, San 
Francisco). Indeed, it is doubtful if completer 
literary expression could enhance the clearness of 
the outlines which the youthful author has chosen 
for his expression of undergraduate life. The ad- 
vantages of a coeducational institution over the 
unisexual type, like Vassar or Harvard, is manifest 
when it comes to the inclusion of a romance along 
with the more ordinary proceedings of a university, 
and Mr. Lichtenstein has done very well in per- 
mitting a pretty love-story to attach itself to his 
narrative. In addition, there are pages of athletics, 
the hero being on the football team (in contrast 
with the college novels of a generation ago, which 
always made their principal character an oarsman), 
and a chosen leader among his fellows, though 
without influence, either of money or social status, 
beyond his own personality. The rivalry with the 
neighboring University founded by the late Senator 
Stanford is made to lend interest throughout the 
work, and the part played by college customs, 
already crystallizing into institutions, finds expres- 
sion. At the same time the emulation in more 
quiet, and scholarly pursuits are not permitted to go 
by default — though the interest here is by no means 
80 great. Photographs of the buildings and grounds 
at Berkeley complete the versimilitude of the work, 
which is undeniably accurate in the letter-press in 
a similarly photographic way. 

A second volume ^he second of the contemplated 
0/ the Dictionary three volumes of Mr. Russell Stur- 
0/ Architecture. gj^'g "Dictionary of Architecture 
and Building " (Macmillan) supplements the first 
in such manner as to make clearly comprehensible 
the richness of the completed whole as a work of 
reference. The volume is rich, too, in material for 
the student and lover of architecture, by reason of 
the extended and scholarly articles on the archi- 
tecture of France, Italy, Germany, Greece, and far- 



off Japan, the architecture of which latter country 
receives sympathetic treatment at the hand of Mr. 
Ralph Adams Cram. Mr. Sturgis's own historical 
knowledge and lucidity of statement appear to ad- 
vantage in this volume, both in the shorter defini- 
tions and descriptions and in sections of the articles 
on the architecture of a number of the countries 
referred to. Mr. Blashfield's article on mural 
painting is interesting in its exposition of ways and 
means, and in the critical notes and comparisons. 
It is a long step from mural painting to house- 
drainage, but that a work like the present would 
be incomplete without treating of both serves to 
show the extent of territory covered in the practice 
of architecture. Mr. William Paul Gerhard, in his 
article on house-drainage, suggests that the matter 
is of so great importance that it should be left to 
specialists. But in all large cities, and most small 
ones, the lines are laid down so rigidly in the sani- 
tary regulations that the architect and the sanitary 
engineer are held to about the same course of 
action. Mr. Gerhard's article enunciates the prin- 
ciples and tabulates certain desirable and necessary 
data. The criticisms previously offered in these 
columns upon the execution and selection of certain 
of the plates and cuts used in illustrating the former 
part of this work hold, though perhaps not so 
broadly, in the case of the present volume. The 
article on India, the architecture of which is so 
distinctive in its character, is not illustrated at all, 
though the field is so fertile in beautiful and readily 
procurable examples ; while the architecture of 
Mexico receives abundant illustration, especially 
from the examples which might properly enough 
be given under the general head of Spanish Archi- 
tecture. However, the Dictionary is assuming its 
form as an admirable book of reference. 



Col. Higginton 1° * volume Under the title " Ameri- 
on American can Orators and Oratory," printed 

orators and oratory. ^^ ^^^ Imperial Press at Cleveland, 
Ohio, are preserved the " lectures delivered by 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson at Western Reserve 
University under the auspices of the Western Re- 
serve Chapter, Daughters of the American Revo- 
lution." The three lectures that make up the book 
deal with "Colonial Oratory," "Revolutionary Ora- 
tory," and " Anti-Slavery and Lyceum Oratory," 
and they are all racy with anecdote. The volume 
is not so much a discussion of particular orators 
and their work as it is a treatment of the develop- 
ment of oratory in its relation to the history of the 
country. Inevitably it touches upon many of the 
things that have stirred men's souls from the days 
of Cotton Mather to Wendell Phillips, but the 
author's vein of pleasantry serves to give interest 
to the story without reviving its intenser feelings. 
For the color that it gives to the days when from 
the pulpit or the rostrum men gave voice to their 
deepest convictions, the book is well worth reading, 
brief and rambling though it be.

The projected translation of the 
^Ifi^^^ complete writings of Friedrich 

Nietzsche has not foand sufficient 
favor to warrant its continaed publication, and the 
three volumes already issued are likely to be all 
that we shall have for some time. Possibly the 
ideas of this remarkable man may turn out to be 
Zukunfts-philosophie, but the present does not find 
them acceptable. Undiscouraged, however, by the 
failure of the complete edition, Mr. Thomas Com- 
mon has set about attracting the public to his phil- 
osopher in a new way. He has just published, 
through Messrs. E. P. Dntton & Co., a volume en- 
titled '' Nietzsche as Critic, Philosopher, Poet, and 
Prophet," which is essentially a compilation of 
choice and striking excerpts from the writings of 
Nietzsche. The book makes an attractive appear- 
ance ; the passages are not too long to grow weari- 
some ; and, altogether, the book is calculated to 
provide a favorable introduction of the philosopher 
to a circle of new readers. An etched portrait and 
an introductory essay are important features of the 
volume. 



Notes. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A noble h\t of literature, presented in a thoroughly 
fitting and beautiful form, is to be found in the reprint 
of Thoreau's essay *' Of Friendship," lately issued in a 
special limited edition by Messrs. Houghton, Mi£Bin & 
Co. Produced at the Riverside Press under the direc- 
tion of Mr. Bruce Rogers, the volume is in every 
mechanical detail a fine example of artistic, dignified, 
and conservative workmanship. Of the essay itself, 
Robert Louis Stevenson said that it contained «' the 
noblest and most useful passage I remember to have 
read in any modern author," and James Russell Lowell 
declared it altogether " worthy of one who has so long 
communed with Nature and with Emerson." This little 
reprint is a volume to be cherished by those book-lovers 
who have been fortunate enough to secure a copy. 

The '• French and English Dictionary," prepared by 
Messrs. Hjalmar Edgren and Percy Burnet, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is a welcome 
improvement upon school dictionaries of the ordinary 
type. It is representative of the best modem philo- 
logical scholarship, and its intelligent use of phonetic 
marks and other symbols makes possible the introduc- 
tion of a great deal of helpful information for which 
one would consult most dictionaries in vain. Stress is 
laid upon the three features of phonetic pronunciation, 
sound etymologies, and the dates of the earliest appear- 
ance of French words in the language. The editors 
have not been afraid of inserting proper names and 
irregular forms in the alphabetical series, for which 
many perplexed students will be grateful. We note 
one necessary criticism. A prefatory table gives us the 
astonishing information that "five francs to the dollar 
is the par of exchange, which fluctuates from time to 
time." Now fluctuation is the one thing which is im- 
possible to a par of exchange, and the relation between 
the franc and the dollar is not to be expressed so simply 
as that. 



Einglake's " Eothen " forms a welcome volume in 
the «« Temple Classics " series, imported by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

" A Laboratory Course in Plant Physiology," by Dr. 
William F. Ganong, is published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. 

A new novel by Dr. James Ball Naylor, author of 
"Ralph Marlowe," vrill be issued next month by the 
Saalfield Publishing Co. 

Volume III. of Dr. Orello Cone's series of " Inter- 
national Handbooks to the New Testament," including 
Hebrews, Colossians, Epbesians, etc., has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

"A Little Book of Tribune Verse," by the late 
Eugene Field, extracted from the files of the Denver 
" Tribune " by Mr. Joseph G. Brown, is published by 
Messrs. Tandy, Wheeler & Co., Denver. 

It is announced that the music publications of Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co., including the " Modem Music 
Series " and its complementary books, will hereafter 
be issued under the imprint of Messrs. Silver, Bnrdett 
& Co. 

Mr. Roswell Field's story " The Passing of Mother's 
Portrait," published in a recent issue of the " Atlantic 
Monthly," is soon to be issued in book form by Mr. 
W^illiam S. Lord of Evanston, 111. The edition will be 
limited. 

" Crazes, Credulities, and Christian Science," by Dr. 
Charles M. Ougbton, is a publication of Mr. £. H. 
Colegrove, Chicago. The book is excellently named, 
and plain speaking, combined with plain sense, are its 
conspicuous virtues. 

" The Legend of Sir Lancelot dn Lac," by Miss Jessie 
L. Weston, is Volume XII. of "The Grimm Library," 
published by Mr. David Nutt. The origin, develop- 
ment, and position of this work in the Arthurian cycle 
are the matters considered in this excellent monograph. 

" Japan and America " is a new monthly paper, 
edited by Mr. Stanhope Sams, and published in New 
York. Its contents are half English and half Japanese, 
the latter, being printed in roman characters. Indeed, 
one of the chief aims of the paper is to popularize this 
particular innovation. 

'« The Chevalier de St. George and the Jacobite 
Movement in bis Favour," edited by Mr. Charles S. 
Terry, and published by Mr. David Nutt, is a narrative, 
ingeniously pieced together from contemporary sources, 
of one of the most fascinating movements in English 
and Scotch history. 

We are very much opposed to the abridgment of 
works of literature for school purposes, but if ever the 
process is justifiable, it is m the case of such a book as 
" Clarissa Harlowe." Mr. C. H. Jones, at any rate, 
has thought the work justifiable, and has performed it 
with much skill. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the 
publishers. 

" The Current Encyclopedia," issued by the Modem 
Research Co., Chicago, is a new monthly publication 
designed to deal, in encyclopedic manner, with the 
topics that are uppermost in the public mind. It has 
the Rev. Samuel Fallows for editor-in-chief, and has 
provided itself with an excellent staff of contributors. 
There will be two volumes a year, and the indexing 
will be cumulative until a volume is complete. The

[Aug. 1, 



first number, dated July, makes a very creditable 
showing, although history and politics seem to get a 
disproportionate share of attention. This inequality, 
we are promised, will be remedied in subsequent issues. 

Beginning with September, the publication of 
" Shakespeareana," a quarterly periodical conducted 
by The Shakespeare Society of New York, will be 
resumed. The Society also announces its thirteenth 
publication, " The Sonnets and Shakespeare's Rival 
Poet, with a Reprint of Chapman's Related Poems," 
by Mr. Arthur Acheson. The volume will be issued 
late in October, in the usual limited edition. 

A most attractive and satisfactory edition of the 
complete works of Charles Stuart Calverley is pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. in connection with Messrs. 
George Bell & Sons of London. The volume contains 
a photogravure portrait, and an extended biographical 
notice prepared by Sir Walter J. Sendall, editor of the 
"Literary Remains of C. S. Calverley," and a long- 
time friend of the poet. 

The report of the Aguilar Free Library Society of 
New York City for the past two years has just been 
issued, and shows a record of remarkable progress in 
an excellent work. The Society maintains four free 
libraries, which are mostly situated in poor and densely 
populated sections of the city, and which show a large 
increase in circulation each year. The open shelf sys- 
tem is now used in all of these libraries, and each one 
has a reference room and also a children's room. Dur- 
ing the past two years 45,767 readers have made use 
of the main reference room. 

It seems that John Fiske, at the time of his death, 
was at work upon " New England and New France in 
America," the one work needed to make his historical 
series practically complete from the Discovery to the 
Revolution, This work would doubtless have been finish- 
ed long ago had not the author's attention been diverted 
by the enterprise called the " History of All Nations," 
under the editorship of Professor Wright of Harvard. 
This series of volumes, twenty-four in number, will 
appear in the Autumn, and for it Fiske wrote the three 
volumes devoted to the history of the New World.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

n. 

Greece is a country from which we do not 
expect much literary work of cosmopolitan 
interest, and the report by Professor Lambros 
mentions hardly a name that is familiar to our 
public. One exception to this statement may 
be made for Mr. D. Bikelas, who has formed 
a Society for Useful Books, " with the aim of 
publishing a volume for the people every 
month. Well printed and bound, and very 
cheap, these books have been published in 
great numbers, and ought to encourage the 
taste for reading." Among works of scholar- 
ship, we may mention " Greek Proverbs," by 
Professor N. Politis ; the concluding volume 
of a " History of Athens under the Turkish 
Dominion," by Mr. D. Kamburoglus ; a " His- 
tory of Crete from the Earliest Times to the 
Present," by Mr. B. Psilakis ; and " Political 
Studies," by Mr. Leon Melas, in which latter 
work " the Bulgarian question and the privi- 
leges of the Greek Church in Turkey are con- 
sidered." 

" In the department of belles-lettres « The Healing 
Plant of Love,' by Mr. G. Drossinis, a really fine novel; 
the tender collection of verses • Alabastra,' by Mr. 
Johannes Polemis; and the substantial poems of Mr. S. 
Martzokis, seem most worthy of mention. • The Death 
of the Palikares ' is a weighty poem by Mr. Konstantin 
Palamas." 

Heer Steyn Streuvels has already been men- 
tioned in these summaries by Professor Fred- 
erieq, and Mr. C. K. Elout, writing from 
Holland, discusses him at much length as the 
one important new writer of the year. 

" He is the true peasant's poet, representing not the 
old Arcadian, unreal school, nor the modern, gloomy 
pessimism of which M. Zola's ' La Terre ' is a grand 
expression, but a sound, warm-hearted, though cool- 
brained poetical conception of reality. He has neither 
enthusiasm nor disdain for the peasant; he looks upon 
him as a thing of nature, which deserves our attention 
as much as a tree or a cloud or a meadow, and even 
more than these because there is a human sonl in the 
case. . . . Besides, this simple young Flemish baker 
has a language of his own. He knows Dutch very well, 
apparently, but he adds to it with archaisms and peasant 
expressions. His language is not Flemish, however, 
but most decidedly Dutch — as sound and sane a Dutch 
as Vondel ever wrote, only with the great advantage of 
linguistic riches from neighbouring stores." 



96 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



Heer van Eeden's " The Limpid Lakes of 
Death " is a novel which illustrates " psychol- 
ogy, culminating in absolute 'pathology." 

" The young lady who is the biproine of this novel 
ends in placid tranquility, after i>assing through the 
basest phases of a woman's life. I^ is, however, notice- 
able that van Eeden never passes the limits of decency 
in this book. An ultra-realistic aiitlor would, no doubt, 
have painted the abject doings of such a woman as his 
heroine in harsher colours. Van Etden is content with 
mere hints, and elaborates only the pathological side of 
the ease." \ 

Three rather important worlds of fiction deal 
with life in the Dutch Indies, j Heer Couperus, 
in his " Stille Kracht " (Sileijt Power), 
" Tries to present an impression of the sullen, passive 
resistance that colonial officials of^en meet with from 
the coloured population, and the mysterious powers 
this population employs, such as the inexplicable throw- 
ing of stones by invisible hands, to show that silent 
resistance. In the opinion of mapy Indian readers 
Couperus has failed to give a strong Impression of these 
manifestations; but his book has caused a certain sen- 
sation, as it treated a question which happened to be 
the topic of the day — the influence of Indian climate, 
Indian surroundings, and Indian life on Europeans. 
Couperus seems to be one of those who consider life in 
the tropics a degrading influence on Suropeans, a vul- 
garization of the higher European character." 

Heer B. Veth's " Life in India " is described as 
" a perpetual depreciation of everything and 
everybody in India, an uninterrnpted series of 
sneers and harsh language." Heer H. Borel's 
" Recht der Liefde " (The Laws of Love) is 
the " story of a young European woman in 
India, whose life at first slowly trickles away 
in the hot climate of a town on the Indian 
coast, but then gets a new impulse in the fresh 
air and the grandeur of the mountains." A 
few more novels are " Langs Lijnen van Gele- 
idelijkheid " (Along Lines of Graduality), by 
Heer Couperus ; " Vlindertje " (Butterfly), 
by Heer Borel ; "Getrouwd" (Married), by 
Heer van Hulzen ; and " Vreugden van Hol- 
land " (The Joys of Holland), by Heer Has- 
pels. The last named writer 
" Is the literary leader of a new monthly which started 
a couple of months ago. ' Onze Eeuw' (Our Century) 
represents a reaction against the progressive views 
which our leading periodical, ' De Gids,' has taken of 
late as regards social life and literature. There are a 
good many professors on the editorial committee, and 
the first articles were rather heavy, even to our Dutch 
taste." 

On the stage, the successful productions of 
the year have been " Op Hoop van Zegen " 
(Hoping for Luck), by Heer Heyermanns, 
and " Vier Ton," by Heer De Koo. 

Writing from Hungary, Mr. Leopold Kat- 
scher reminds us that the author of " St. Peter's 



Umbrella " is " the very best of contemporary 
Hungarian novelists." This year he has pub- 
lished " A Strange Marriage," his longest 
novel. " An historical background displays 
the adventures and divorce of a couple forcibly 
married against their wish by a clergyman who 
had seduced the wife." Other works of fiction 
include " Budapest," by Mr. Tamas Kobor 
(the beginning of a projected series after the 
Rougon-Macquart pattern); "The Struggle of 
the Huns," by Mr. Gyula Werner ; " A False 
Legend," by Mr. Akos Pinter ; " Swamp," by 
Mr. Istvan Barsony ; " That Ass Domokos," 
by Mr. Dezso Malonyay ; " Egers Stars," by 
Mr. Geza Gardonyi ; and many collections of 
short stories, the best of which are Mr. Jokai's 
" Tombstone Album " and Mr. Herczeg's 
" Arianna." The last-named writer, with his 
" Ocksay the Brigadier," a historical drama, 
" has scored by far the greatest stage success 
of the year — indeed, in the whole history of 
the Hungarian stage." Speaking of stage 
matters, it is curious to note that Shakespeare's 
" Troilus and Cressida," which our own stage- 
directors never consider seriously, has had 
thirty performances during three months at the 
Hungarian National Theatre. " In poetry 
there is only one volume worth mentioning — 
Mr. Emil Makai's ' Poet's Fate,' a collection 
of fine verse combining mastery in rhyming 
with beauty of thought." A goodly number 
of works in literary and historical criticism are 
mentioned, the most important being the " Ro- 
mance of My Life," by Mr. Jokai ; " Yester- 
day, To-day, and To-morrow" (essays on 
contemporary writers), by Professor Bela 
Lazar ; " Diderot Studies," by Professor Alex- 
ander ; " A Hundred Years of the History of 
Hungarian Art," by Mr. Tamas Szana ; " The 
Hungarian Nation Past and Present," by Mr. 
Elek Benedek ; " The History of Hungarian 
Costumes," by Mr. Geza Nagy ; " An Inter- 
national World's Academy," by Mr. Florence 
Kemeny ; and " Education in Great Britain," 
by Mr. Geza Somogyi. 

Dr. Guido Biagi opens his report of Italian 
literature in a somewhat depressed strain. The 
past twelvemonth, he tells us, 
" Presents a meagre balance-sheet, without any import- 
ant literary gain. The reason for this state of affairs, 
which has been more or less persistent of recent years, 
may be political as well as social. A certain dissatis- 
faction permeates the air, and casts over everything a 
subtle prepossession which cannot be explained, but 
which unquestionably lays hold upon writers and turns 
them aside from imaginative speculation. They are not 
even conscious of the features of the new forms of art 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

that are being elaborated by the new century. While 
afraid of seeming old, antiquated men of the last age, 
they do not see clearly even the outlines of the writing 
of the future. The social and political anxieties of the 
past fatal year, added to artistic uncertainties, have 
certainly cramped both the creative development and 
the native enthusiasm of authors." 

An interesting statement is that " in Italy 
everything is done by means of a movement." 
The movement at present is in the direction of 
dialect poetry, recited in public by the poets. 
The idea was started by Sig. Cesare Pascarella, 
" a most original Roman poet, a born inter- 
preter of the soul of the Roman plehsJ'^ 
" It is a pity that his " Serenata ' and ' The Discov- 
ery of America ' cannot be translated into English; but 
this is out of the question, since the Roman dialect 
that gives savour to the whole would be lost in the 
process. And yet something would remain — the 
originality of the fundamental idea. ' The Discovery 
of America ' is narrated at a wayside inn by one man 
of the people to another — told, that is to say, in the 
fashion in which a modern Roman labourer would re- 
count it, with a series of entertaining anachronisms. 
. . . These sonnets of C. Pascarella constitute the most 
brilliant literary success of the year. Since every one 
understands the Roman dialect more or less, the 
theatres were crammed with applauding auditors to 
hear him recite. This year in Florence the local 
Societk di Letture had the happy thought of introduc- 
ing not only Pascarella, but also the best among the 
other Italian dialect poets. Their example was imi- 
tated by other Italian cities, with the result that this 
year our dialect poetry has been honoured and noticed 
as it never was before." 

Another phase of this movement is presented 
by the Italian Popular University which brings 
lectures upon various subjects within easy 
reach of the masses, who prove eager to avail 
themselves of the opportunities for culture. 
Turning to books proper, the writer calls our 
attention to the " History of Italian Litera- 
ture " (an illustrated work), by Sig. B. Weise 
and Sig. E. Percops ; Professor Orazio Bacci's 
centenary edition of Cellini's immortal "Vita "; 
Mrs. Jessie White Mario's selection from the 
writings of Mazzini, and the unpublished cor- 
respondence of the great patriot, about to ap- 
pear under the editorship of Sig. Ernesto 
Nathan. There have been numerous Dante 
monographs, a work on " Guiliano I'Apostata," 
by Sig. Gaetano Negri ; " La Storia dell' Arte 
Italiana," by Sig. Adolfo Venturi (to be com- 
pleted in six volumes); " La Democrazia nella 
Religione nelle Scienze," by Sig. Angelo 
Mosso ; and " La Decadenza delle Nazione : 
Latine," by Sig. G. Sergi. 

•' Poetry can boast of two strong and original creations, 
'La Canzone di Garibaldi,' by Sig. Gabriele d'Annnn- 
zio, and ' Xerone,' by Sig. Arrigo Boito, both issued by 



Treves, of Milan, tie publisher who seems to have the 
monopoly of Italy's best poetic and imaginative pro- 
ductions. To speak adequately of these two works 
would carry me beyond the limits assigned to my re- 
view. I will therefore only say that the ' Canzone di 
Garibaldi ' and the » Nerone ' are the two most impor- 
tant works issued this year, and that the number of 
copies printed has been as large as the authors expected. 
Both are virile and original productions that have g^ven 
rise to long and impassioned discussions." 

Works of fiction include "Piccole Monda 
Moderno," by Sig. Fogazzaro ; " Suor Gio- 
vanna deUa Croce," by Signora Matilde Serao ; 
" Sul Meriggio," by an English gentleman who 
styles himself " Gian della Quercia "; " Liliana 
Vanni," by Sig. Diego Angeli ; " LaSignorina," 
by Sig. G. Rovetta ; and " Le Tre Capitali," 
by Signora Dora Melegari. Coming to dra- 
matic literature, we are told that 

"The success achieved by Sig. Gabriele d'Annnnzio 
with his < Cittk Morta ' was not by any means universal, 
and that of a few other plays was not sufficient to 
prove that there is any real vitality in our theatrical 
productions. Signora Eleonora Dose, who staged the 
* Cittk Morta,' has been selected by Sig. Luigi Rasi, as 
a subject for a critical and biographical study. In this 
book are to be found many curious and unpublished 
details concerning the great artist, who is indeed a 
self-made woman." 

A final word may be given to translations, 
which include things as incongruous as " Ben 
Hur," " The Prince and the Pauper," " The 
Invisible Man," and the "Jungle Books,'* 
from the English, contrasted with new trans- 
lations of the " .^neid," the Homeric Hymns, 
the " Plutus " of Aristophanes, and the whole 
of "■ Faust," translated in the original metres 
by Sig. Guiseppe Biagi. 

Herr Bjornson's " Laboremns " is the book 
of the year in Norway. This play, which may 
be read in English in a recent number of the 
" Fortnightly Review," is something of a dis- 
appointment. A portion of Herr Brinchmann's 
description may be quoted. 

" The play describes the emancipation of a young, 
enthusiastic artist from the wiles of a beautiful enchant- 
ress, whose criminal selfishness towards all those who 
stand in her way is finally revealed. Lydia herself is 
also an artist (a pianist), who longs to win a secure 
position in society. She gains her ambition by marriage 
with a rich man, whose sick wife she kills by means of 
her music instead of curing the suffering woman, as she 
was supposed to do. The husband has his suspicions;, 
on the very night of the wedding the murdered wife's 
ghost appears to him, and Lydia coinpensates herself 
in the arms of a young composer for the'happiness she 
can no longer find with her own husband. Her new 
lover idealizes her as an Undine in an opera he is com- 
posing, and she helps him with it; but he presently 
finds that somehow he has lost all interest in his art, so 
they resolve to travel far away together — no doubt the

Dr. Ibsen has produced nothing during the 
year, owing to his serious illness ; but we are 
given the happy news that " h^ is nearly him- 
self again." Herr Lie's " Wulffie og Comp," 
staged during the year, madei no impression. 
The chief dramatic successes have been Herr 
Egge's " Jakob og Kristof^r, " Herr V. 
Krag's " Baldevin's Bryllup," and Herr Bull's 
historical and patriotic " Toraenskjold." A 
long list of novels is given, pone of great 
importance. Among them are, '^ Moder Lea," 
by Herr Johan Bojer ; " Modi Kvaeld," by 
Herr Tryggve Andersen ; " Isaalc Seehusen," 
by Herr V. Krag ; " Noma," by Herr Schmit- 
ler ; and " En Praests Dagbog," |by the lately 
deceased Sigbjorn Obstfelder. Oie noteworthy 
volume of verse is " Det Dyre Biiod," by Herr 
Nils Collett Vogt, a cycle of poems whose 
" stately rhythms roll thundering along like a 
high, boisterous sea in the sunshine." 

" The procession of Polish literature of the 
year," writes Dr. Adam Belcikowski, 
" Has passed by under the flag of Sienkiewicz. His 
jubilee has been celebrated in his fatherland, and sim- 
ultaneously his name has been re-echoed over almost 
the whole of the civilized world louder than that of any 
Polish author before him. Sienkiewicz's jubilee can be 
compared only with that of Kraszewski some twenty 
years ago; and it is characteristic of the present con- 
ditions of literature that the authors to whom such 
universal — one might almost say colossal — admiration 
has been paid are both writers of romance." 

Herr Sienkiewicz's romance, " The Knights of 
the Cross," is justly characterized as inferior 
to the great trilogy. This writer has also 
made a stage-experiment with the comedy 
*' Mr. Zagloba as Match-maker," but has added 
little to his laurels by this piece. " Italia " is 
a cycle of poems by Miss Konopnicka, de- 
scribed as ," our best poet since the death of 
Adam Asnyk." Of the theatre we read that 
" ' The Wedding,' a fantastic drama by Mr. Wyspianski, 
has made the greatest sensation. The piece was widely 
advertised by its numerous allusions to persons well 
known in the literary world, and with a large section of 



the public its patriotic tendency secured it a hearty 
welcome. Among the ranks of our moderns Mr. S. 
Przybyszewski beyond question possesses the most 
dramatic talent; his latest play 'The Golden Fleece' 
gives ample proof of this, but owing to its unbounded 
pessimism and gloomy atmosphere it finds few ready 
hearers. The older-established and noted hands among 
our dramatists have not recently produced anything of 
special consequence." 

Contrary to the original announcement, an 
article on Russian literature, by Mr. Valerii 
Briusov, has appeared in a later issue of the 
" Athenaeum," and may now be summarized. 
The death of the poet Soloviov is the heaviest 
loss of the year in Russia, and our chronicle 
opens with mention of this fact, and with some 
account of the poet's characteristics. Soloviov 
was both poet and philosopher. 

"In his philosophical works he wished to justify the 
greatest revelation of Christianity, the doctrine of the 
resurrection from the dead. His poetry also reveals 
his philosophical ideas; they do not, however, coarsely 
obtrude themselves in his verses, but light up his crea- 
tions from within." 

The poetry of the year includes much note- 
worthy work, such as " Houses on Fire," by 
Mr. C. Balmont; "New Songs," by Mr. N. 
Minski ; " Illusions," by Mr. C. Fofanov , 
and a volume by Mr. Golenistchev-Kutuzov, 
who " remains faithful to the tradition of 
Pushkin," and who is called " the poet of 
Buddhist creations." In fiction, the name of 
Mr. Maxim Gorki is just now obtaining vogue 
in England and America, which gives special 
interest to the following account of " Trio," 
his latest production : 

" He draws in it the fate of three boys who have 
grown up in an alley in the midst of poor people, mur- 
derers, thieves, and prostitutes. One of the boys, Hya, 
is always seeking for truth: he possesses capacity, and 
endeavors to fight his way to a pure life — to live in 
such a way that no one can look down upon him. The 
second, Pavel, is a meditative and poetic soul. When 
he grows up he loves a girl named Viera with all the 
blindness of passion; he marries her, and she, wishing 
to help him, robs a tradesman, and is sent to prison. 
The third, Yakov, is an unconscious philosopher; even 
when a boy he surprises his companions by his questions, 
wishing to ascertain whence everything comes. In the 
tale are all forms of sin and crime, but one poor woman 
inquires, ' Who will remember God, if it is not the 
sinners ? " The style is unequal. Some portions of 
the story are artistically perfect, others insipid. It is 
unfinished." 

Mr. D. Merezhkovski has published " The 
Gods Who Have Arisen," being the second 
part of his trilogy of novels, and dealing with 
" the renewal of paganism at the epoch of the 
Renaissance." The first part took us back to 
the age of Julian the Apostate, and the third 
part will have Peter the Great for its central

figure. The secular conflict of ideas between 
Hebraism and Hellenism is the general theme 
of this colossally-planned work. The most 
important drama of the year is " The Three 
Sisters," by Mr. Anton Chekhov. " In his 
usual masterly way he represents in it all the 
terror, all the helplessness, of Russian town 
life. Works of erudition and important enter- 
prises in translation are described at consider- 
able length, but we must pass them by without 
further mention, concluding with this paragraph 
of both literary and political interest. 
" Literary society during the past year has been agi- 
tated also by events which have no immediate relation 
to literature, but concern prominent writers. The ex- 
communication of Count Lyof Tolstoy has aroused in 
many a sympathy with the veteran, who has been per- 
secuted for his ideas. Mr. Maxim Gorki has been im- 
prisoned for his sympathy with the outbreaks of the 
students. The same fate has befallen the publishers of 
one of the best magazines, ' Life,' the publication itself 
has been suppressed by order of the Ministers, against 
which there is no appeal. A number of other writers 
have been banished from the two capitals, among them 
Mr. C. Balmont, the accusation against him being that 
at a literary evening he quoted some verses which had 
not been previously submitted to the censor." 

We fancy there is some connection between 
this banishment and the fact that Mr. Bal- 
mont has not written, as in former years, the 
review of Bussian literature with which we are 
now concerned. 

Last of all, we come to the Spanish review 
of Don Rafael Altamira. As ever, the Spanish 
intellect runs largely to historical investigation, 
and the critical editing of the great writers. 
With all this we have no space to deal, nor 
with the department of periodical literature, 
which exhibits much vitality. 
" Yet if this literary vitality is a good sign, we are dis- 
couraged by the disappearance within a brief interval 
of Spain's most distinguished writers, whose recent 
deaths form a national misfortune: Riano, whose merits 
are well known to the readers of the ' Athenaeum ' and 
the whole English public; Balaguer, the historian of 
Catalonia and founder of the beautiful Museo-Biblioteca 
of Villanueva and Geltrii; the Marquis of Valmar, one 
of our soundest and most eloquent savants; Campoamor, 
the most thoughtful poet that Spain produced in the 
nineteenth century; and, lastly, just as I am writing 
this article, Leopoldo Alas, one of the most original and 
cultivated of our modern authors — novelist, critic, and 
philosopher — whose powerful imagination has made a 
deep impression on the generations that have succeeded 
the Restoration." 

Coming to belles letfres, we read that the name 
of Senor Galdos has been the most conspicuous 
of the year, and one of his productions has 
made a great stir. It is 

" His play ' Electra,' which the Liberal party, and es- 
pecially the anti-clericals, have taken up as a flag under 



which to fight the leligious reaction which really exists 
among us and defeids itself by forbidding Catholics to 
enter any theatre vhere the work is represented." 

Senor Galdos has also published a fourth series 
of his " Episodi)s Nacionales." 

" In the realm )f fiction there is one event of the 
first importance t« chronicle, the reprinting of «La 
Regenta,' by the lite Leopoldo Alas, which for many 
has proved a work aitherto unpublished. ' La Regenta ' 
has been rightly cescribed by all the critics as one of 
the best Spanish njvels of the nineteenth century, and 
some say that if it were relieved of a few incidents it 
would be the best.' 

Senor Echegaray has produced a play, *' El 
Loco Dios," which *■' will not figure in the list 
of his masterpieces, " and Senor Nunez de Arce 
*' Has issued a patriotic poem, ' Sursnm corda,' in which 
he displays the qialities already well known of his 
lyrical poetry, at cnee stardy and harmonious." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



HAS COLLEGE ENGLISH IMPROVED? 
(Ti the Editor of The Diai.) 

Is the standaid of English composition at American 
colleges as high now as it was twenty years ago? Can 
the college mau of to-day write as respectable English 
as the college man of yesterday vrrote? With a view 
to obtaining a satisfactory answer to these questions, a 
request for a leply to them was sent to the principal 
American colleges. Replies were received from most 
of the institutions, including Yale, Princeton, Harvard, 
Cornell, Wesleyan, Union, University of Wisconsin, 
Western Reserve, Middlebury, Brown, Williams, Uni- 
versity of Michigan, Amherst, Bowdoin, Trinity, Ober- 
lin, Dartmouth, University of Nebraska, Hamilton, 
Rutgers, Stanford, etc. 

Of the replies received, over eighty per cent, said 
that college English had improved; twelve per cent., 
that there had been little if any improvement ; while 
less than eight per cent, asserted that the standard of 
composition was lower than that of twenty years ago. 
Most of the last-mentioned class found a cause for this 
deterioration in the increased prominence given to 
scientific over literary training. 

In one of the replies stating that the standard was no 
higher, a somewhat novel view was taken of what is 
meant by "the college man." The writer said: 

" I suspect that • the college man ' writes no better 
English than he did. • The college man ' is an abstrac- 
tion, an average of the men attending our American 
universities. He is therefore composite in his nature, 
being so many parts student of the liberal arts, so many 
of law, of meidicine, of agriculture, of forestry, of civil 
and mechanical engineering. No doubt the engineering 
portion of ' the college man ' is growing proportionately 
to the literary portion. Moreover, a larger percentage 
of American youth is in college nowadays, which tends 
to increase the portion coming from homes in which 
the reading habit and literary tastes have not become 
hereditary. It may well be, therefore, that the propor- 
tion of college men who write correct English has been 
diminishing during these two decades which have seen

so great an increase in the enrollment. Nevertheless, 
I am much mistaken if the actual dumber of students 
possessed of literary tastes and abl i to write correctly 
is not as large as, indeed, larger thsn, ever before." 

A note of warning is possibly soinded in this reply 
from a prominent college professor 

" If the college student of to-daji writes poorer En- 
glish than in former years, a thing jf which I am not 
quite sure, I should regard the fict as a part .of a 
movement all along the line. It seems to me the spirit 
of and hunger for scholarship is not so great as formerly: 
scholarship, and with it literary tasti and ability, is at 
a, discount, and society and athletics ire on top." 

Dr. William T. Harris, United St.tes Commissioner 
of Education, is of course uncommcnly well qualified 
to speak on such a subject. To a le ter requesting his 
opinion, he replied: 

"In my opinion, the college man of to-day writes 
much better English than did the college man of twenty 
or twenty-five years ago, or than tie college man of 
my time, which was forty-three years ago. There is 
less bombast in the college writing If to-day, and less 
sophomoric attempt at fine writing ;| and the attempt 
to adorn one's pages with quotatmns from classic 
authors has almost entirely disappear sd, whereas in the 
time of Edward Everett it was considered to be the 
proper thing. There is a much richeir style used now, 
because there is reflected in the style of the man a 
much broader view of the world and a wider gleaning 
from literary sources." 

If one will take the trouble to eximine the back 
numbers of the college magazines and compare them 
with current issues, he will find that in the latter the 
thought is not only more vigorous but also better ex- 
pressed. Considerable weight should Ibe attached to 
this evidence, for here, perhaps, may be found the best 
•expression of college literary life. The comparison is 
the more accurate, too, because actual specimens of the 
•work are before the investigator, thusj removing the 
tendency to overestimate the past while j underestimat- 
ing the present. 

The answer to the question, " Is the standard of col- 
lege English as high now as it was in the past ? " does 
not concern itself as to what this standard is — whether 
it be high or low. If it be true, as some assert, that 
men in the senior classes of our best colleges cannot 
write a letter describing a foot-ball game without mak- 
ing blunders that would disgrace a boy of ten years, 
what sort of a letter did the senior who belonged to 
the class of 1875 write ? Was it a worse or a better 
one ? Whether the present standard is as high as it 
should be, is quite another question. In the opinion, 
however, of those in a position to speak with authority, 
the college student to-day writes better English than 
did the average student of twenty or thirty years ago.

The Greek Thinkers axd Their 
Environment.* 



Zeller's Philosophie der Griechen., already 
cited by Grote and the scholars of the last 
generation as the chief authority in its field, 
and growing from edition to edition till it now 
fills six stately tomes, is a noble monument of 
German scholarship. But however indispen- 
sable to the professional student, it is not a 
book that can be read. The want of such a 
work is now being supplied by the Austrian 
Professor Gomperz in his Griechische Denker. 
Professor Gomperz, in addition to a scholar- 
ship long since proved and tested in special 
researches, possesses many eminent qualifica- 
tions for his task. To begin with, he is not 
a Hegelian, but studies the history of philos- 
ophy from the only point of view possible in 
the twentieth century — that of entire sympathy 
with and frank acceptance of the fundamental 
postulates of modern science. Secondly, he is 
well read in French and English literature, 
and is in particular a student and admirer of 
John Stuart Mill ; and Mill, as would be ad- 
mitted by those who think that they themselves 
have outgrown him, is most salutary reading 
for a German savant. Lastly, his style, though 
to English and French taste a little flowery 
perhaps, is vigorous, picturesque, and thor- 
oughly readable. His second volume, dealing 
chiefly with Socrates and Plato, is now being 
published in Germany. The first volume, 
which treats of the Pre-Socratics, lies before 
us in the English translation of Mr. Laurie 
Magnus, revised and warranted by the author. 

The Pre-Socratic philosophers are one of 
the most fascinating and tantalizing of themes. 
Plato, as Emerson says, makes great havoc of 
our originalities. But already in Plato's time, 
as Pater reminds us, " the very air was sickly 
with cast-off speculative atoms." We can only 
discern faintly the outlines of the systems from 
which these atoms fell, and fancy that we 
detect, in isolated, pregnant, and picturesque 
sayings, the germs of all the philosophies and 
sciences of Western Europe. But the impos- 
sible task of reconstructing the systems and 
determining the logical sequence of their 
thought and the detail of their content still 
tempts some in each new generation of schol-

ars. Common as the tale has become by repe- 
tition, the story of these early Greek thinkers 
still thrills with fresh surprise everyone who is 
brought to a vivid and first-hand realization of 
its significance. How could they, amid all 
their first groping, ignorance, and helplessness, 
without libraries, laboratories, systematic rec- 
ords, or instruments of precision, — how could 
they, amid all their necessarily childish guesses, 
divine so much ? " Verily," says Professor 
Gomperz, " the pen of the historian might 
hesitate where to begin or end if he endeavored 
to write an adequate account of the inexhaus- 
tible range of fundamental truth contained in 
the exaggerated statements of Heracleitus." 
*' Any history of philosophy," says Emerson, 
" fortifies my faith by showing me that what 
I had supposed were the rare and late fruit 
of a cumulative culture, and only now possi- 
ble to some recent Kant or Fichte, were the 
prompt improvisations of the earliest in- 
quirers, — of Parmenides, Heracleitus, and 
Xenophanes." 

When the old Ionian thinkers — Thales, 
Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heracleitus — 
resolutely shut out from their minds the shapes, 
grotesque and obscene, fantastic and beauti- 
fully wild, that had held in thrall the imagi- 
nation of early man, and set themselves to 
inquire " concerning nature," about the causes 
of each thing and the first principles of all 
things, then was the true re-birth and renewal 
of the human spirit — a renascence such as 
the world has never seen in all the centuries 
since. Then the old songs of gods and heroes 
and demigods lost their spell, and the true 
hymn of man was chanted for the first time : 

" His face is set to the east, his feet on the past and its dead ; 
The snn re-arisen is his priest, and the heat thereof hallows 

his head. 
His eyes take part in the morning ; his spirit ontsonnding 

the sea 
Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod 

or tree. 

Past the wall ansormoonted that bars out our vision with 

iron and fire 
He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and 

sons to conspire." 

Not at once was all this to be. There were to 
be many eddies and back currents in the stream 
of progress, long centuries when humanity 
wandered in the wilderness or went astray 
after false gods ; but the first authors of a 
rational conception of the world must be cred- 
ited in large measure with the fruits that it has 
brought forth. 

We shall not attempt to summarize Professor 
Gomperz's re-statement of this oft-told tale. 



As his title, " Greek Thinkers," implies, he 
does not confine himself to the exposition of 
systems, but enceavors to replace the Greek 
philosophers in the intellectual environment 
that fostered th3m. He depicts for us the 
world of Homer c and Hesiodic imagination, 
traces the development of popular and mystic 
religion, orphisa and the belief in immortality, 
studies the process of ethical reflection and 
the growth of pirer moral ideals in poets and 
historians, and orings out more fully than has 
hitherto been done the contribution of Greek 
medicine to the creation of the scientific and 
philosophic spirit. In the effort to be enter- 
tertaining, he sometimes goes a little beyond 
the evidence in touches of picturesque detail 
or in the suggestion of modern parallels. 
" Protagoras, wandering through the halls of 
the beautiful ard regular city built on the plans 
of Hippodamus, might converse one day with 
Herodotus on questions of ethnology, and on 
another with Empedocles on problems of nat- 
ural science," — only there is no proof that 
Protagoras ever visited Thurii. Empedocles 
may have taught the doctrine of four elements 
as a compromise between one and infinity be- 
cause " he may have learned in the school of 
practical politics to appreciate the value of 
compromise.' But the world would not contain 
the books that might be made up of such pos- 
sibilities. Tbere is a profound impressiveness 
to readers of Darwin, in Heracleitus's saying 
that " war is the father of all things," espe- 
cially when taken in connection with the sequel: 
" Some he has made gods, some men, some 
slaves, others freemen." But we cannot infer, 
with Professor Gomperz, that the old Ephesian 
conceived of the struggle for existence as test- 
ing and eliminating or preserving the qualities 
of mankind. The innocent fragment of Xeno- 
phanes, " The gods did not show all things to 
mankind at the beginning, but in the course 
of time by searching they found out the bet- 
ter," is made to " strike a note of strict scien- 
tific reason " by the interpretation " but they 
search for themselves until they discover the 
better," whereby the antithesis between "in the 
beginning " and " in the course of time, or at 
last " is altered to an antithesis between the 
help of gods and unaided human effort. Simi- 
larly, Xenophanes's poetical expression of a 
skeptical mood is interpreted as a demand for 
" verification," in the sense of modem science. 
Empedocles's isolated statement that bones con- 
sist of four parts of fire, two of moisture, and 
two of earth, is treated as a glorious anticipa-

tion of modern quantitative jhemistry. Two 
disconnected fragments of Hjracleitus are so 
phrased and pieced together as to yield the 
edifying scientific canon, " Wj must not specu- 
late about the highest thing i in lightness of 
heart," ybr " Punishment willlovertake the lie- 
smith and the false witness." The Darwinian 
survival of the fittest is deduded from Empe- 
docles's account of the speedy perishing of the 
monstrous manhearted oxheaced shapes, with 
no warning that the thought s probably due 
to Aristotle, who merely usei the grotesque 
fancy of Empedocles to illuitrate the idea. 
There are other slight inaccuracies, due to the 
necessary foreshortening or tm effort to avoid 
controversy. But all together they need not 
impair the reader's faith thai he has before 
him as accurate a history as n perhaps com- 
patible with a fairly brief and popular presen- 
tation. I 

After the stress laid on piysical science, 
and perhaps connected with itj the chief fea- 
ture of Professor Gomperz's liistory is the 
diminished importance attributed to Parmen- 
ides and the Eleatics — the pHlosophers of 
Being and Rest. The traditional account is 
that after the failure of the old Ionian hylo- 
zoists the Eleatics introduced the notions of 
absolute Being and Unity, and tie dialectic of 
pure thought, and that the greatj constructive 
thinkers of the fifth century, jErapedocles, 
Anaxagoras, and the Atomists, b^lt up their 
systems with constant reference toj Parmenides 
and in partial acceptance or evasion of his 
conclusions. Professor Gompeiz minimizes 
this influence of the Eleatics. All of the es- 
sential ideas on which the fifth century thinkers 
built he finds already in the old lonians — the 
eternity of nature, the process of change, the 
reign of law, the quantitative persistence of 
matter in all, the qualitative persistence of 
matter in Anaximenes's doctrine that all things 
are air more or less rarefied or condensed, the 
idea of a vacuum through which particles 
of matter are evenly distributed in some un- 
known Pythagorean aimed at in Parmenides's 
polemic. To Parmenides he assigns the credit 
only of the sharper formulation of some of 
these ideas. And he is inclined to reject the 
traditional view that atomism was derived from 
this Parmenidean formulation. The atoms 
undoubtedly resemble the Parmenidean Being, 
except for their constant motion and multi- 
plicity. They are plenary being, unchangeable, 
devoid of secondary qualities. But this is no 
proof that they were derived from Parmenides, 



and there is no evidence, he thinks, of his- 
torical connection between the two schools. 
Pythagoreanism and the natural development 
of the old Ionian physics sufficed. For the 
rest, the great achievement of Leucippus and 
Democritus, he thinks, was not the invention 
of the atoms, but the proclamation of the great 
and still valid principle of the correlation of 
sensible qualities with quantitative and spatial 
changes and the distribution of matter. Atom- 
ism, not the philosophy of Anaxagoras, is the 
culmination of the Pre-Socratic philosophy. 
The true logical and chronological sequence 
is misrepresented if we put Anaxagoras last 
because he happened to live at Athens, intro- 
duced Nous or mind as a cosmic agent, and is 
alluded to by Socrates in the Apology. 

The last chapters of the volume, dealing with 
the Sophists and the age of " enlightenment " 
and emancipation, are especially interesting. 
The general view is akin to that of Grote. The 
Sophist is an estimable personage, " half pro- 
fessor, half journalist." Protagoras receives 
the fullest treatment. Professor Gomperz 
sensibly rejects the ingenious attempts that 
have been made to construct for Protagoras 
out of the Theaetetus a profound psychology 
of relativism. He renounces from the start 
the hopeless task of reconciling the ingenious 
dialecticism of the Theaetetus with the edifying 
rhetorical Protagoras of the dialogue that bears 
his name. The doctrine of pure relativism 
attributed to the Protagoras of the Theaetetus 
is really, he thinks, the theory of Aristippus, 
whom as a contemporary Plato could intro- 
duce in colloquy with Socrates only under an 
alias. The volume closes with an appreciative 
chapter on Thucydides — in his own field, one 
of the greatest of Greek thinkers. 

The translation can be read. But in spite 
of revision by Professor Gomperz, it is by no 
means fyee from errors. The German idiom 
shows through unpleasantly in some inaccurate 
or un-English turns of phrase, such as " no 
more fortunate explanation," " this plump in- 
vention," " smooth account books," " the omin- 
ous decree of history of which Xenophanes was 
a witness." The proof-reading of the proper 
names is careless, as is usually the case in 
English and American translations of learned 
German works. This is particularly unfor- 
tunate, because such books are intended for 
readers who may be misled. It is strange that 
reputable publishers are not more careful to 
seek expert aid in this matter.

Tble Relations of Geography anu 
History.* 



It is a comparatively recent dictum that 
accurate geographical knowledge is not only 
important for, but absolutely essential to, a 
correct understanding of history. It is how- 
ever, so generally accepted a fact, that all 
historical studies of the last decade are charac- 
terized by a profusion of maps of all kinds as 
well as by ample discussions of geographical 
details. There are endless interesting and 
reasonable deductions to be drawn from an 
examination of physical causes ; but a danger- 
ous tendency has arisen, on the other hand, to 
extreme statement. The theory has been 
worked too hard, and conditions of climate or 
peculiarities of topography have been brought 
into service as a basis for wholly unwarranted 
conclusions. 

It is gratifying to find that the Rev. H. B. 
George, in his " Relations of Geography and 
History," has been careful to point out the 
limitations of geographical influence. In a 
chapter on " Fallacies of the Map," after dis- 
posing of the frequent generalization that 
mountain ranges and great rivers have invari- 
ably determined the direction and extent of 
racial migrations and colonization, he takes up 
the more modern questions of so-called natural 
boundaries and of nationality. Natural bound- 
aries, says Mr. George, furnished the plea 
upon which aggressive rulers claimed justifica- 
tion for cruel wars in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries ; while nationality has 
been the excuse for the wars of the nineteenth 
century. Thus, Louis XIV., in steadily push- 
ing the frontier of France toward the north- 
east, claimed the Rhine as a natural boundary ; 
yet the history of all great river basins estab- 
lishes the fact that both banks of a stream are 
more likely to be occupied by the same people, 
than that they shall form a barrier between 
hostile races. The plea was therefore purely 
arbitrary and unjust, yet it was effective in 
arousing national sentiment and patriotism. 
When Germany took Alsace-Lorraine from 
France in 1870, one justification for the act 
was that she was restoring to the mother coun- 
try a province and a people forcibly torn from 
her centuries before. Here too the plea was 
effective in arousing the imaginative patriotism 
of the German people ; yet it stirred only bit-

Press. 



temess and antempt in the hearts of the 
inhabitants of the restored province. From 
these and man^ other similar illustrations, the 
author draws the conclusion that natural 
boundaries thu; far in history have been largely 
imaginative coiceptions without much founda- 
tion in fact, aid that nationality, of which so 
much has beei made during the last thirty 
years, while it is in truth a factor in the deter- 
mination of a state's frontier, has been very 
greatly overesimated. 

The questicn of the influence of physical 
environment oa the development of sea- power, 
Mr. George treats in much the same way. 
England is a great maritime nation, not merely 
because her people inhabit an island, but be- 
cause of many other forces — political for- 
tunes, racial characteristics inherited from 
non-maritime ancestors, the appearance of 
great leaders or far-seeing statesmen. So, 
also, it is a common generalization that moun- 
tains give birth to ideas of liberty. But ex- 
amined in the light of exact history, we find 
that men who would not submit to be enslaved 
fled to the mDuntains, there to find more defen- 
sible homes, where they could maintain their 
cherished ideals of liberty. Freedom is the 
heritage of a race, not of a soil. 

However, Mr. George has not devoted him- 
self exclusively to destructive criticism of the 
ideals of historical geography. On the con- 
trary, the larger part of his book is given, in 
a separate chapter for each country, to a sane, 
painstaking examination of the development of 
European states in the light of geographical 
influence. In these chapters he indicates and 
proves the importance of physical details in 
determining both wider race-movements and 
minor events and political happenings. He 
attacks masty generalizations, but he shows 
himself a careful student of the minute details 
of historical geography. Thus his book, while 
not suited to the general reader, may well serve 
as a condensed synopsis for teachers and stu- 
dents of historical geography.

French author is trained clingf to his works. 
As we read them, we who havelnever felt the 
heat of the conflict over literarylprinciple, and 
who probably are contented to read our En- 
glish authors without troubling curselves much 
over what school they belong tL even we im- 
bibe the critical spirit, find ourselves analyzing 
and defining, and welcoming eac\ new volume 
of essays on French authors with almost a 
French interest. 

The first of Professor Harper's " Masters " 
is Corneille, the last is Balzac, and the literary 
development of the included t^o hundred 
years is outlined with sufficient (jompleteness 
to give value to the volume as al whole over 
and above that of the separate esteays. And 
yet each chapter stands by itself. 1 Several are 
revised reprints, and the process o^ unification 
has left traces in a few noticeable! repetitions 
from chapter to chapter ; but aa these em- 
phasize important points, they hate their ex- 
cuse. From beginning to end there is a marked 
growth from the general to the individual. 
First comes the broad sweep necessary to con- 
centrate the peculiarities of a great national 
literature within a thirty-four page chapter on 
" The Place of French Literature." Next, is 
a chapter on "The Golden Age of French 
Drama," the most broadly influential feature 
of the literary history. Then follow two chap- 
ters on " The Revolutionary Analysis," giving 
the growth of the eighteenth century, grouped 
first broadly about Saint-Simon and Mon- 
tesquieu, then narrowly about Voltaire, who 
as " man of letters " and semi-blind liberator 
of the human mind epitomizes the century. 
The remaining three chapters, on Hugo, Sainte- 
Beuve, and Balzac, are increasingly personal ;

so that our interest seems to undergo a certain 
change as we read, — or rather, perhaps, we 
feel that though we start at a definite begin- 
ning and go logically on, we end without having 
arrived at any particular result. 

The author has not attempted an introduc- 
tion to these masters. One can make their 
acquaintance, of course, only by reading what 
they themselves have written ; but having even 
slight acquaintance with them, one is sure to 
find much needed help and guidance in these 
chapters. For example, Sainte-Beuve's Cavr 
series are delightful reading from the start ; 
but if, as is quite likely, the reader is already 
familiar with critics like Taine who have a 
manifest system, Sainte-Beuve will seem to 
him a sort of mosaic of a thousand gossipy 
bits put together without design. He needs 
to discover that Sainte-Beuve has an art which 
is more than a " system," and Professor Har- 
per goes straight to this point and lightens the 
difficulty in a way that shows him a skilled 
literary guide. This picking out the crucial 
difficulty in the way of appreciating each 
author, and throwing needed light just there, 
is the most marked characteristic of the volume 
so far as it deals with individual writers. 

The chapter on Hugo of necessity recalls 
his varied literary life, especially the exciting 
times of the publication of " Hernani," but the 
author skilfully steers straight through this 
maelstrom to centre the interest upon what he 
considers the most important phase of Hugo's 
character. 

" It is in itself a great achievement to have done so 
much honest work of a high character as Hugo did. 
It is no small distinction to have guided a people's 
hopes for eighteen years from his island of exile. It 
is a noble end of a zealous life to have worn for fifteen 
years the crown of such a nation's kingship. But when 
even these proud honors are forgotten, children's voices 
will still repeat and men's hearts still echo a hundred 
songs of the greatest lyric poet of France." 

He recognizes the fact that " foreign students 
of French literature are less likely to seek 
acquaintance with Hugo's poems than with his 
plays and novels," and for that reason devotes 
the most important part of his chapter to the 
poems ; yet we can but regret that Les Miser- 
ables, Quatre-vingt-treize, and Notre Dame de 
Paris, the great works by which Hugo is gen- 
erally known out of France, had not received 
more attention, especially as they are often 
misunderstood and misappreciated. Yet Hugo 
is altogether too huge an enigma of force to be 
satisfactorily dealt with in one chapter, and it 
is of real service to focus the light upon that

phase of his character which marks all his 
works and has given them their enduring 
qualities. 

The chapter on Balzac is of somewhat dif- 
ferent character, inasmuch as it is more of an 
introduction. It is the getting started in read- 
ing this writer's novels that is the difficulty the 
uninitiated feel and which Professor Harper 
meets. The reader is disheartened when he 
faces the enormous mass of printed matter in 
the " Human Comedy," and if he makes a 
beginning without a guide he is almost sure to 
find not genius but tedious disagreeableness. 
By excellent classification, and brief, apt com- 
ment. Professor Harper narrows the " Human 
Comedy " down to what is really worth reading, 
and, largely by means of quotations from Bal- 
zac's correspondence, he goes more deeply into 
the difficulty, and shows how the author was 
led now by his great genius, now by the vulgar 
commercialism of his time. 

In his preface. Professor Harper says . 

" So unified is French literature, so intimate are all 
the myriad relations of all its parts to the whole, that 
it is possible to gain a fairly comprehensive view of any 
one of its periods of development by considering a rep- 
resentative man of letters who was then the dominant 
figure." 

And again : 

" This volume of essays, of course, makes no claim 
to give a general outlook over the two centuries which 
lie between Corueille and Balzac. Yet the book may 
perhaps be regarded as an imperfect illustration of the 
method outlined above." 

The two centuries under consideration are 
peculiarly easy of presentation by this method. 
During nearly the whole of this time, " classic " 
principles reigned almost undisputedly ; the 
Romantic reaction which Hugo represents and 
the Realistic development which Balzac stands 
for can be understood only as they are set in 
relief against classicism ; and while these two 
writers were at the height of their influence, 
the critic Sainte-Beuve was showing his fellow- 
countrymen that the vital principles which 
have made the French masters of the art of 
writing and teachers of the world keep them 
all close kin to the classicists of the Golden 
Age. Down through the chapter on Voltaire, 
the general treatment gives us something like 
completeness which makes us feel this unity ; 
but beyond there, the points of observation are 
too few for the increasingly rich landscape, 
and the relationship of one to the other and of 
each to the whole is left to blind inferences. 
The author recognizes this when he says : 
" The absence of any substantive treatment of 



Rousseau and hs followers would at once pre- 
clude pretentiois to systematic completeness." 
We can only vish the process of unification 
had been carried a little farther. But one 
thing we do ge with rather marked complete- 
ness considerii^ the limitations, and that is a 
distinctly tangble conception of those broad 
characteristics which make up the peculiar 
spirit of Frenci literature. The first chapter 
outlines it, the others fill in the details. Here 
is the real valie of the book as a whole. 

These essayi are not overflowing with spon- 
taneous originality of conception ; what char- 
acterizes them rather, is a judicial weighing 
of conflicting opinions and eminently sane 
conclusions. The author has the rather rare 
virtue of unitiig to " Anglo-Saxon deep seri- 
ousness " ability to appreciate the fine artistic 
qualities of tie French. The finish of the 
sentences, the modelling of the paragraphs, 
the massing o: the chapters, are worth study- 
ing in themselves ; the choice of details and 
their logical development mark the master of 
exposition. Altogether there is simple straight- 
forwardness which may deceive the unappre- 
ciative, but vhich comes only from scholarly 
mastery of subject and form.

The Four Georges.* 



The concluding volumes of Mr. Justin Mc- 
Carthy's " History of the Four Georges " have 
recently come from the press, and although Mr. 
McCarthy has associated his son with him in 
their preparation, and some fifteen years have 
elapsed since the publication of the initial vol- 
ume, there has been no departure from the 
former methods of treatment, and the interest 
is sustained to the end. While this work adds 
but little to our knowledge of one of the most 
dreary and least honorable periods of English 
history, the author has done a distinct service 
by conscientiously collecting a large amount 
of material from various sources and putting 
it into the form of a connected story. And he 
has done this with such good judgment and 
grace of expression, that he has imparted to 
the book all the freshness and charm of a work 
of fiction. In the best sense of the word, the 
work may be called a popular history ; for 
while Mr. McCarthy does not do serious vio-

lence to historical accuracy, hewrites with pic- 
turesqueness and power, and with something 
of the magnetic quality which bade Macaulay 
the most widely read author ol his day among 
the masses of the people. Moi sover, Mr. Mc- 
Carthy has apparently tried 13 perform the 
same service for the period of t e Georges that 
Macaulay undertook for the period of the 
Restoration, and not altogether without success. 

It was a favorite saying oi Carlyle, that 
true history was, after all, only^the connected 
biography of the world's great men, — a con- 
ception which Mr. McCarthy las apparently 
adopted in the preparation of this work, for 
the most of his material has been put in the 
form of life-stories of the greit leaders who 
shaped policies and gave tone! and direction 
to public thought and activitief. These bio- 
graphical studies are not seriously analytical, 
but are rather bright, sketchy jv^ord-pictures, 
which bring out in strong relief and vivid 
coloring the personalities of meir subjects, 
thrown against a well-defined background made 
up of the movements and poliaes to which 
their lives gave expression. Fejwr clearer or 
more striking character delineations can be 
found than some of those contained in this 
work, among the most notable oi which may 
be mentioned those of Lord George Gordon, 
Warren Hastings, and Charles F<lx. 

Mr. McCarthy's career might afford him 
some excuse for not always doing^.full justice 
to the home government when treating of her 
policy toward her dependencies. Bi|it, although 
his sympathies are evidently strongly enlisted, 
it would be difficult to convict him of unfair 
partisanship, even when treating of Ireland 
and her grievances. In dealing with the Ameri- 
can Revolution, he denounces in no unmeasured 
terms the stupidity and malevolence of the 
King and his advisers ; yet the most conser- 
vative Englishman of the day conld hardly 
find fault with his utterances, for they have 
come to be the well-established conclusions of 
history. The peculiarly just and sympathetic 
temperament of the author is again shown in 
that portion of the book dealing with the 
career of Warren Hastings, in which he has 
departed widely from the policy of Burke, 
Macaulay, and many others, in striving to do 
justice to this brilliant and greatly maligned 
Englishman. Perhaps he has gone too far in 
his apology, but for this he may be easily par- 
doned when we remember the burden of in- 
famy under which the memory of Hastings 
has so long labored. 



In conclusion it may be said that no one, 
however well-informed he may be, can read 
this work without gaining new and more vivid 
conceptions of many of the great men of the 
period which it treats, and a clearer idea of 
the motives and policies which dominated them.

Studies in Educational, Problems.* 



One of the most helpful and suggestive educa- 
tional books of the past year is that by the late 
Professor Hinsdale on " The Art of Study." It is 
written for the teacher, from the standpoint of the 
pupil, and aims at a definite end : to teach pupils 
how to study, rather than to store their minds with 
any particular stock of knowledge. The author 
holds that the failure of pupils in their studies is 
chiefly due, first, to their ignorance of how properly 
to attack a lesson ; and, secondly, to their inability 
to sustain the attack when once made. To over- 
come these errors and attain the end sought, the 
author demonstrates the proper relations that should 
exist between teacher and pupil, and then presents 
methods of establishing and maintaining these rela- 
tions. At the close of each chapter are suggested 
parallel readings designed to aid the student in 
comprehending its underlying psychologic prin- 
ciples. The entire book is clear, logical, and well 
written ; and if the principles embodied can become 
thoroughly understood and judiciously and ade- 
quately applied, it will do much to eliminate educa- 
tional waste and intellectual dissipation. For these 
reasons it merits a wide sale.

Greek," by Professors Bennett and Bristol, of Cor- 
nell University, is the initial one of the " American

Teachers Series," edited by Professor James Rus- 
sell. The volume is worthy of special attention, 
both because of its intrinsic merit and because it 
marks the beginning of a new pedagogic literature 
in this country. Germany has long had such a 
literature, but the American teacher has been com- 
pelled to feed upon scattered husks. The aim of 
the series is " to discuss the educational value of 
each subject, the reasons for including it in the 
curriculum, the selection and arrangement of ma- 
terials in the course, the essential features of class 
instruction, and the various helps which are avail- 
able for teachers' use." So far as the initial volume 
is concerned, this aim has been well sustained ; 
though one might wish that certain features had 
not been so dogmatically stated. The book is sane, 
scholarly, and exceedingly suggestive. It fills a 
long-felt want in our educational literature, and 
should be heartily welcomed by every teacher of 
the classics. 

" Nature-Study and the Child," by Mr. Charles 
B. Scott, is a contribution to the rapidly growing 
literature of this subject. The book gives a con- 
crete illustration of how Nature-study should be 
taught ; discusses its province, aim, and limitations ; 
its principles and determining method ; the method 
of studying material ; the expression work of the 
school ; the relation of Nature-study to reading, 
literature, geography, and arithmetic ; the selection 
and sequence of material ; and then outlines an 
eight-year course of study similar to that in the 
Report of Committee of Ten. The book is the out- 
growth of the author's long experience as teacher 
and supervisor in the public schools, and therefore 
has the wholesome tinge of the practical every-day 
workshop. Although the work suggested is still 
excessive, and emphasizes the subject way beyond 
its legitimate field, it is truly sensible and refresh- 
ing when compared with the great mass of Nature- 
study literature. 

Dr. Schaeffer's treatise on *' Thinking and Learn- 
ing to Think," edited by Dr. Brumbaugh, is a very 
sensible and attractive book, and strikes at the very 
heart of school work. It is the outgrowth of the 
author's long experience, and bears on every page 
the stamp of the scientific practical school-man. 
From the kindergarten up through the high school, 
the complaint is everywhere made that " pupils do 
not think," and the author attempts to show why 
this is, and how it can be remedied, by giving a 
careful analysis of the psychologic bases of good 
thinking. The entire book is clearly written, richly 
and pointedly illustrated, and, while not a profound 
work, is well calculated in matter and treatment to 
prove most helpful and stimulating to the great 
mass of teachers. 

One of the most wholesome of recent books is 
" Education and Life," by President Baker. It is 
composed of papers and addresses delivered at 
various times and before different audiences, ^nd 
therefore has no centre of unity. Its general tenor, 
however, may be summed up under two heads : 



first, the welfare of society and the safeguard of 
democracy demaid that, while our educational aims 
must remain ida,l, all education must be brought 
into closer sympathetic relation with the problems 
of every-day life and the second is a vigorous pro- 
test against wha is called " soft pedagogics," or, 
in the author's vords, " false interpretation of the 
doctrines of pleisure, pursuit of inclination, pun- 
ishment by natiral consequences, and following 
lines of least res stance." While one may not agree 
with all of the conclusions reached, the book is 
incisive, scholary, and timely, and should be care- 
fully read by every thoughtful educator and citizen. 

" Education tnd the Philosophic Ideal," by Dr. 
Horatio Dresser, is a strong inspirational book. It 
is not put forth as a mere educational discussion, 
but rather as at appeal, through education, to all 
that is noblest ii life. It holds that every teacher 
must understand life, philosophically and spirit- 
ually, in order to be of greatest service ; and then 
proceeds to demonstrate this through its various 
chapters. The book is charmingly written. 

Professor Young's volume on " The Teaching of 
Mathematics in the Higher Schools of Prussia " is 
a valuable addition to American pedagogical litera- 
ture, and American students may well study it. It 
reproduces, in a clear and lucid manner, the exact 
class-room work of the German master, and shows 
wherein his methods differ from those of the Amer- 
ican. With the Germans, the teacher is the great 
central factor; with the American, the text-book 
plays the leading role. With the German method, 
the teacher teaches ; with ours, he hears reciMtions. 
The superiority of the former method is clearly 
pointed out ; and in order that the subject may be 
more easily understood, the book is prefaced by a 
brief exposition of the entire German school-system. 

The appearance of Professor Shaw's " School 
Hygiene " in the " Teacher's Professional Library" 
is still another evidence of the growing interest 
in the important subject which it treats. The book 
sets forth concisely and accurately the conditions 
which surround the great mass of school-children, 
and then proposes measures for the protection and 
])romotion of their physical and mental health. 
The matter presented is in the main a clear re- 
statement of accepted facts, except the chapters on 
Eyesight and Hearing, and on Handwriting, which 
are new, scientific, and exceedingly valuable. If 
the facts and suggestions contained in this book 
should be thoroughly comprehended and persistently 
followed by teachers and school authorities, it would 
prove of inestimable service to the home, the school, 
and the state. All such literature should be warmly 
welcomed. 

Another volume of the series just named is that 
by Professor Redway on " The New Basis of Geog- 
raphy." As the title indicates, the book is some- 
what of a departure from the geographic conceptions 
still so largely in vogue throughout this country. 
The matter presented, however, has long received 
due attention from the best schools and universities

"Treason and PIo, (Appleton), 
could hardly be said to be compre tensive if meas- 
ured by the period of time covered but it has been 
at least a courageous thing to amplify into the pro- 
portions of a book the very brief Recounts of the 
last relatively unimportant ten yearei of Elizabeth's 
reign. These years have commonlylbeen disposed 
of in a few sentences, or at the most in a chapter, 
by general historians ; while Mr. Hime's account 
is limited to a scientific examination of the plots, 
in England and out of it, for the restoration of 
Catholicism and the overthrow of Elizabeth in favor 
of Philip II. or some Spanish protegee The sources 
of this labor comprise both older an^ well-known 
works, and those more recently discovered docu- 
ments of which the author has been'so diligent a 
student, as the Spanish manuscripts |)f Simancas. 
These latter, together with Irish Stat^ papers, the 
latest volume of the Venetian papers, the Hatfield 
papers, and unpublished documents in the Archives 
Nationales at Paris, have supplied a wealth of ma- 
terial which Mr. Hume has analyzed and arranged 
in such fashion as to furnish for each plot and 
intrigue a connected and authoritative account. 
The result, then, is the elaborately detailed descrip- 
tion of plot after plot, or plot within plot, and 
intrigue upon intrigue, for the greater part of the 
five hundred pages of the book. It is unnecessary 
to say that such a work does not appeal to popular 
taste, though the author's style of narration seems 
intended rather more for general than historical 
readers. Yet, while episodal history may not be 
interesting in itself, without earnest workers in that 
field accurate history of a more readable character 
could not be written ; and considered in this light, 
Mr. Hume's present volume merits the highest 
praise. In it he has given us absolutely accurate 
knowledge, in so far as his sources afford informa- 
tion, of the Catholic conspiracies from 1593 to 
1603. A perusal of his volume will show that the 
hopes of Philip and of the extreme Catholics were 
far from being destroyed forever by the defeat of 



the Armada of 1588, and that Puritan England 
was many times in serious danger after that date ; 
that Philip himself was less a fanatical Catholic 
than a scheming despot grasping at power ; that 
James of Scotland plotted with all parties, and de- 
ceived all in turn ; that Essex and Cecil fought 
each other as bitterly, though as secretly, as they 
fought the common enemy ; that spies invariably 
betrayed their employers ; and that England was 
saved to the Reformation more through the Puritan 
temper and enthusiasm of her people than by the 
genius of ruler or of statesmen. In one minor 
point only does the author's judgment seem open 
to criticism, and that in connection with a subject 
which has not called for any extended statement. 
Ralegh, in the attack on Cadiz, is represented — 
as is usual in histories of that event — as reconciling 
Essex and Howard, and persuading them to an 
immediate attack. Then, leading the advance, " he 
struck straight as a hawk at its quarry, at the two 
greatest ships of the Spanish navy." The incident 
is unimportant in itself, but upon it Ralegh's repu- 
tation as a naval commander largely rests ; and 
Mr. Julian S. Corbett, in " The Successors of 
Drake," working in the same period and using 
largely the same sources as Mr. Hume, has effec- 
tually destroyed even this slight foundation for 
Ralegh's naval fame. It is probable that the present 
work was already in press before Mr. Corbett's 
book appeared, for the impression otherwise re- 
ceived from every page of " Treason and Plot " is 
that of a laborious, exact, and discriminating study 
of all available sources and authorities. 



Admirers of Marie Bashkirtseff's 
at;?e^C-3. "Journal" will doubtless welcome 

the new volume of her " Last Con- 
fessions " (Stokes), illustrated with portraits of 
Marie and several of her friends, and containing, 
besides her diary for three-quarters of the last year 
of her life, a very striking series of letters between 
her and Guy de Maupassant. It is undoubtedly 
in these that the book finds its best excuse for 
being. The Marie of the diary of 1883 and 1884 
is the same Marie of the earlier volumes, — mor- 
bidly analytic, passionately self-confident, inordi- 
nately vain alike of her beauty and her talents ; 
absorbed to-day in her gowns, her dinners, or her 
lovers whom she did not love, — to-morrow hang- 
ing, breathless if half-scornful, on the praises of 
the art critics ; stung continually by the gadfly 
ambition, and driven to " touch everything " and 
leave something before the dying out of the candle 
that is " cut in four and burning at every end." 
But this Marie we knew already. In her letters 
to Maupassant there is the new interest of seeing 
her at work. " I woke up one morning," she tells 
us, " with the desire of getting the pretty things I 
know how to say appreciated by a connoisseur. I 
searched, and chose him." In six letters " the 
pretty things" — presented anonymously — have 
won over to real enthusiasm this cynical French-

man for whom " everything is threadbare," to be 
" divided into boredom, farce, and misery." •' Let 
us settle accounts over the commonplace," replies 
Marie in her third letter. " You are right, on the 
whole. But Art just consists in making us swallow 
the commonplace by charming us eternally, as Na- 
ture does with her eternal sun, and her olden earth, 
and her men built all on the same pattern." It is 
because Marie is an artist at life, if supremely an 
egotist too, that this new volume will be certain to 
find an audience, though of course it can scarcely 
hope to repeat the triumph of its predecessors. 

Handbook of the ^^ *^® excellent series of " Historical 
ekiefcMetoj Guides" to the principal cities of 

Northern. ludy. Europe, begun by Mr. Grant AUen, 
only four volumes had been issued when his labors 
were cut short by death. A fifth volume, called 
"Cities of Northern Italy" (A. Wessels Co.), 
similar in scope and purpose to its predecessors, 
has been well done by Mr. Allen's friend, Dr. 
Greorge C Williamson. The cities chosen are 
MUan, Verona, Padua, Bologna, and Ravenna. 
Differing widely in customs, dialect, art, and gov- 
ernment, as these cities have done in the past, often 
at war with each other and with the great Imperial 
power that sought to weld them into one whole, 
each naturally possessed its own individuality, 
which is reflected in the buildings and paintings 
that remain within its walls. Dr. Williamson's 
little book undertakes to impress upon the tourist 
what are the characteristic features of each of these 
places, and therefore to direct him to what he must 
certainly see in order to comprehend the spirit of 
each individual place and to gain an intelligent 
idea of Italy. The finest brick architecture of Italy 
is to be seen at Verona ; the work of Giotto can 
only be understood after a visit to Padua ; Francia 
can only be studied in Bologna ; the art of mosaic 
has its finest example at Ravenna ; and so each 
town has its own supreme attractions. For those 
who go to Europe with an honest and reverent de- 
sire to learn what they can from the Old World, 
this scholarly and convenient handbook will be 
found a desirable supplement to the invaluable

The Eebrev, and " "^^^ Origin of Republican Form of 
the AmerieoK Government in the United States of 

Commonwealth. America " (Putnam) is a thoughtful 
discussion of the effect which religious ideas had in 
the shaping and practical working of our present 
form of government. The author, Mr. Oscar S. 
Straus, adduces some cogent reasons for maintaining 
that the Hebrew Commonwealth, which embraced 
that period of the history of the children of Israel 
from the Exodus to the selection of Saul as king, 
presented the model of a Democratic Republic to 
the early fathers of America. He says the central 
or national government of this commonwealth was 
divided into three departments, namely : the Chief 
Executive, who was called Judge or Shophete ; the 
Senate, Sanhedrim or Synedrium ; and the Assem- 



bly, which was tie popular branch of government. 
He introduces topious illustrations from the Old 
Testament to slow that this ancient government 
was not a goveriment by priests, or a purely relig- 
ious commonwalth ; the fact that, with the single 
exception of Eli no priest was ever elected to the 
chief magistracy during the entire period of the 
Commonwealth, opposes any such interpretation. 
Mr. Straus does not claim that " the structural parts 
of our form of government were derived from what 
was believed to be the components of the Hebrew 
Commonwealth but only that this Scriptural model 
of government, which was democratic, as distin- 
guished from kiigly rule, had a deep influence upon 
the founders of our government, and prepared the 
minds of the people, especially in the New England 
colonies, so that they not only longed for, but would 
not content thtmselves with, any other form of 
government thin that form which had the divine 
sanction, the gtvernment of the Hebrews under the 
Judges." The volume before us is the second re- 
vised edition oi Mr. Straus's work, it having been 
first published m 1885. The present edition con- 
tains an histoneal essay by the late Emile de 
Laveleye, the eminent Belgian publicist. The sug- 
gestive value of this book to the student of Amer- 
ican history engaged in making original researches 
cannot be too strongly emphasized. 

There is a decided demand for a 
Coim^t^^. history of the United States, mid- 
way in size between the high-school 
texts and the larger histories, and broader in treat- 
ment than either of the volumes of the " Epoch 
Series." Many people desire to read some history 
of their country, but can find no very satisfactory 
account of '.he Colonial period, and are appalled 
by the bulk of Schouler, McMaster, or von Hoist, 
covering the period of Independence. A good re- 
view of both periods, moderate in compass and 
developing the underlying causes that have brought 
us to our present position, would be useful in many 
ways. We have thought that the numbers of Put- 
nam's " Story of the Nations " series on " The 
Colonies " and " The United States," which have 
for some time been announced as in preparation, 
might meet this demand. The number on " The 
Colonies," by Miss Helen Ainslie Smith, has recently 
been issued in two volumes. The result disappoints 
our anticipation so far as the earlier period is con- 
cerned, since the book is not strong enough for the 
purpose indicated. The author has emphasized 
the " story " idea by striving to make the narrative 
as entertaining as possible, and in this has fairly 
succeeded. Unfortunately, a faulty arrangement 
of matter spoils the effect. Anyone who hate under- 
taken to present the history of the English Colonies 
in America knows the difficulty of correlation. 
Sometimes the streams run in separate channels, 
sometimes unite for a while in one combination, 
and later divide and form other combinations. 
The best that can be done is to treat the Colonies

[Aug. 16, 



A new short life 
oj George Eliot. 



in natural groups down to the Fench war, and 
after that to treat them as a whoh The method 
of this work is to take each Colonj in the acciden- 
tal order of settlement, and to gi^3 its story sep- 
arately from start to finish. Ths; the history of 
the Revolution, divided in this wai into twelve or 
thirteen parts, cannot be satisfactoi^, goes without 
saying. Other parts of the work mfEer similarly 
from its artificial arrangement. 

One of the best as we I as the briefest 
of the numerous biographies of 
George Eliot is the sne written by 
Miss Clara Thomson for the seiies of "West- 
minster Biographies" (Small, Mamard & Co.). 
George Eliot's outward surrounding, from girlhood 
on, had a great influence in determiiing the setting 
of her novels ; while her inner life lad a powerful 
force in shaping the actions and Motives of her 
characters. Her religious opinions lave been vari- 
ously judged and misjudged, passing as they did 
from extreme evangelicalism in you h to positivism 
in later life ; but her attitude as a \ihole is happily 
characterized in one of the concludiig pages of the 
book before us: "Throughout theSe changes of 
opinion she retained what were her\^mo8t striking 
characteristics, — her intense desire \ to raise the 
level of life, to awaken the spiritual Consciousness 
of her contemporaries. Her very [negation of 
orthodox creeds increased her passion for humanity ; 
and the conviction that there could lie no further 
compensation for present pain inspired her with an 
intense longing to help the losers in life's war, and 
to insist with increasing solemnity on the inexorable 
law of consequences." An ample chronology at 
the beginning and a bibliography at the end of the 
volume are additional features of excellence in this 

small book. I 

In Mr. C. L. Stainer's iollection of 
rnvTctZli. the " Speeches of Oliver Cromwell " 
(Oxford University Press), we have 
an historical source-book of the best type, with all 
the scrupulous accuracy of modern scholarship. 
The manuscripts of the period have been carefully 
examined, and the existing reports of the great 
orator's speeches have been followed with literal 
exactness. Not only are those speeches given of 
which reports are to be found, but the " substance " 
of a large number of other and less-known speeches 
is given. In his Preface, the editor discusses the 
question of the fidelity of the reports that have 
come down to us, and gives incidentally some idea 
of the Parliamentary reporting of the seventeenth 
century. "On the whole, the general conclusion 
must be that the original reports of these speeches 
are missing, that many circumstances doubtless 
conspired to make them difficult to decipher, and 
that there is no very great reason to suppose that 
our translations or copies of them are necessarily 
accurate. We must make the best of the texts left 
to us, but they do little justice to the man who 
seems to have been the greatest orator of his time." 



The book is thus a valuable aid to the study of the 
history of Cromwell's day, and of that leader of 
men who was in so many ways the embodiment of 
the best spirit of his time. As an accompaniment 
to the recent lives of Cromwell, it is essential to 
the real student of biography. The reader cannot 
but wonder and regret that so little remains of the 
words of one who played so prominent a part dur- 
ing this important epoch of Parliamentary history. 
The publishers have given the book an attractive 
dress, and there is an excellent body of notes. 

We give but half praise, though that 
rS&7 not faint nor grudging, to Mr. E. 

M. Clerke's " Fable and Song in 
Italy " (A. Wessels Co.). Of his two objects, 
neither seems to us quite attained, although both 
offer something of interest. Where he had in mind 
the tracing of the antique, the classical element in 
the mediaeval legend of Charlemagne as it took 
literary form in the epics of Boiardo and Ariosto, 
he had a subject in which we hold it quite impos- 
sible for anyone but a genius to be " exhaustive 
and scholarly " and at the same time to attract 
and fascinate the reader. Mr. Gierke disclaims 
the first of these objects, but in such a subject one 
cannot really leave the feeling for scholarship and 
completeness entirely behind. As a result, the first 
part of the hook is sometimes interesting and 
sometimes correct, but often quite superficial and 
often dull. Further, when we get on in the 
book toward the end we rather miss the continuity 
in subject that the author has in mind in dealing 
with some subjects in more modern Italian litera- 
ture. But here, as in the earlier part of the book, 
there is a good deal in one place or another that 
one likes to turn over. 



The terror of 
mosquitoes. 



Popular interest in mosquitoes has 
been greatly increased by recent 
discoveries which have shown how 
these insect pests may carry disease and how they 
are primarily responsible for the ravages of malaria. 
Dr. L. 0. Howard, of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, has rendered the public a 
great service in preparing for general use his book 
on " Mosquitoes" (McClure, Phillips & Co.), which 
treats of the life-habits of these creatures, details 
the method by which some diseases are carried by 
them, and gives a simple outline of the classifica- 
tion of the known North American forms with 
especial attention to the characteristics of the dan- 
gerous species. The successful efforts which have 
been made in some localities afflicted with mosqui- 
toes to relieve the plague are reported, and prac- 
tical precautions are set forth for the use of homes 
and communities in protecting themselves from 
the annoyances and dangers which these little 
pests bring. The facts contained in this volume 
should be in the possession of every household, and 
the book should form a part of the equipment of 
campers and travellers.

Edinburgh. 



There is no city in old Scotland that 
is so attractive to the traveller as 
Edinburgh. He is not satisfied with 
one day's sojourn, nor can he as easily leave at the 
end of the first week as he could the first day. He 
wants to spend several weeks and " do up " the 
city. Mr. John Geddie's " Romantic Edinburgh " 
(Dutton) is a treasure for just that man. The book, 
with its scores of illustrations, takes the reader into 
every part of that historic city, and displays with 
wonderful historical knowledge the persons and 
events connected with this and that old close or 
house. The ravines, the streams, the crags, the 
fortresses, all stand out with great vividness. The 
Walter Scott enthusiast, the admirer of David 
Hume, the follower of John Knox, the lover of 
R. L. Stevenson, will all find food for their enthu- 
siasm in this noble old city. Mr. Geddie has laid 
all the past of Edinburgh under tribute to his pages, 
and has made a volume of eminent usefulness. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Newson & Co. publish two series of modern 
language text-books, German and French, respectively, 
that seem to us particularly commendable. Each series 
contains three volumes — a " First French Book," a 
" Second French Book," and " French Daily Life," — the 
German set being similarly divided. The text, even 
in the book for beginners, is wholly in the foreign 
language, and requires that language to be spoken in 
the class-room from the start. A good many modern 
ideas have been embodied in these books, which aim to 
effect the reforms in teaching sought for by such men 
as Professor Victor, and such societies as the Associa- 
tion Phon^tique Internationale. A Swiss teacher, M. 
Alge, is primarily responsible for the plan of this 
series, and the American editor is Mr. Walter H. 
Buell. 

" Hamlet " and " Romeo and Juliet " are the first 
two volumes of " The Dowden Shakespeare," published 
by the Boweu-Merrill Co. This edition is in handsome 
library form, and each play will have a volume to itself. 
The aim of the editor — who is no other than Professor 
Edward Dowden — has been to provide a scholarly 
text, to supply such notes as the cidtivated reader 
really needs, and " to exhibit the variations from the 
editor's text which are found in the primary sources in 
so far as those variations are of importance for the 
ascertainment of the text." Each volume has a critical 
introduction by the editor. These books are printed in 
large clear type, and the edition is in every respect ex- 
ceedingly attractive. 

Mr. John La Farge's series of lectures given at the 
Metropolitan Museum at New York, seven years ago, 
has been newly reprinted with the title " Considera- 
tions on Painting " (Macmillan) . These lectures deal 
with such subjects as " Personality and Choice," " Sug- 
gestion and Intention," *• Illusions," " Sincerity," etc. 
From the nature of the case, the tone is somewhat 
pedagogical, but Mr. La Farge's utterances on art sub- 
jects carry a weight and interest for others as well as 
students. 



Notes. 



Mr. Alan Sanlers is the author of the " Elements of 
Plane Geometry" published by the American Book Co. 

" The Guilfoid Speller," by Messrs. A. B. Guilford 
and Aaron Lovdl, is a recent publication of Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. 

"Exercises ii QuaUtative Chemistry, Chiefly Inor- 
ganic," by Frofesor John White, is a recent educational 
publication of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

«' The Natunl Arithmetic," by Mr. Isaac O. Wius- 
low, is a publication of the American Book Co. It is 
a work in three mrts, each occupying a separate volume. 

"The Wife )f Bath's Tale: Its Sources and Ana- 
logues," by Mr, G. H. Maynadier, is a new volume of 
the " Grimm L brary," published by Mr. David Nutt. 

" The Proven^l Lyric," by Professor Lewis F. Mott, 
is a lecture delivered before the Comparative Litera- 
ture Society, aid now published in a neat volume by 
Mr. W. R. Jenkins. 

"The Book jf Asparagus," by Mr. Charles Ilott, is 
published by Mr. John Lane. It is the first volume of 
a new series, edited by Mr. Harry Roberts, and en- 
titled " Handb'wks of Practical Gardening." 

" Tennyson," by Mr. Morton Luce, is a " Temple 
Primer," following Mr. Gardner's " Dante " in what 
we hope will prove a series of volumes devoted to the 
great poets. The Macmillan Co. are the American 
publishers. / 

The " Hand-Book to the Pan-American Exposition," 
published by Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co., is a con- 
venient guide for the tourist, and is supplemented with 
a section, almost as necessary as the main part of the 
work, upon Niagara Falls. 

" Poetry for Poetry's Sake " is the title of a pamphlet 
printed at t\e Oxford Clarendon Press. It contains 
the inaugural lecture of Dr. A. C. Bradley, delivered last 
June upon the occasion of his first appearance as Pro- 
fessor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. 

The success of Mr. B. L. Taylor's " Bilioustine " has 
been so pronounced that Mr. William S. Lord, the 
publisher, now announces a limited edition de luxe of 
this clever parody — if it be possible to parody the 
grotesque forthpnttings of the self-acclaimed philos- 
opher of the " Philistine." 

M. Jules Verne's " Uue Ville Flottante," abridged 
and edited by Mr. C. Fontaine, and a volume of " Lec- 
tures Historiques" upon "Le DLx-Septieme Si^cle en 
France," edited by Misses Delphine Duval and H. Isabell 
Williams, are two recent school texts published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. are the publishers of 
" Seven Great American Poets," by Miss Beatiice Hart. 
This is a book for school use, and Poe is placed, very 
properly, as one of the seven — the other six being 
those universally accepted. The treatment is primarily 
biographical, and secondarily critical, while extracts 
are supplied in generous measure. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. make the interesting 
announcement " that their publishing department will 
hereafter be under the full management of Mr. F. G. 
Browne, for the past twelve years business manager of 
The Dial. Mr. Browne comes to his task well fitted 
by temperament, training, and business experience to 
undertake the responsibilities of his position." Those

the period in question will understand how well these 
words describe Mr. Browne's qualificatims for the work 
which he has now taken up, and will onfidently await 
the new impetus that his management will give to the 
publishing department of that old and dignified house. 

"Jesus fra Nazaret Set med Nutidiojne," by Herr 
Sigurd Trier, is a pamphlet that cones to us from 
Copenhagen. The "modern eyes" vith which the 
figure of Jesus is viewed are oi the son that reject the 
supernatural in order to find a deeper mman meaning 
in the personality of the founder of Chistianity. The 
writing is temperate in tone, and rather persuasive than 
aggressive in manner. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. hav« added to their 
'* Religion of Science Library " Bisaop Berkeley's 
"Three Dialogues between Hylas aid Philonous." 
This work, of course, is one of the cli.ssics of philo- 
sophical literature, but roost people know it by name 
only, and have little idea of its literay charm or of 
its logical cogency. No one has ever improved upon 
Berkeley's statement of philosophical nealism, and it 
remains the best of all books for openisg the mind to 
the fundamental truth of metaphysics, i 

The publishers of Edgren and Burnets " French and 
English Dictionary " take exception to cor recent criti- 
cism of that work. The passage to whi*h we objected 
is. the following: "The 'par' of French exchange in 
New York is five francs to the dollar. It fluctuates by 
eighths of centimes." Quoting this, we condensed it 
slightly, making it read : " Five francs to the dollar is 
the par of exchange, which fluctuates jrom time to 
time." Admitting the literal inaccuracy iof the quota- 
tion, we are unable to detect any essential difference 
between the two forms. The substitution of " which " 
for " it " makes absolutely no change in the construction 
of the passage, and the contention that the pronoun 
refers to " French exchange " alone is quite untenable. 
The " ' par ' of French exchange " is the subject of both 
sentences, for the term " par of exchange " is as insep- 
arable a compound as " man of war." Ct)nsequently, 
both sentences, as they stand in the " Dictionary," are 
wrong. The first is an inaccuracy, since the "par" in 
question is 5.18-}-. The second is an absurdity, since a 
" par of exchange " cannot fluctuate.

THREE NEW TEXT BOOKS 
American Literature 

By Alphonso G. Newcomer, The Leland Stanford Jr. University. 

1. The book itself is a contribution to American Literature. Its study, therefore, culti- 
vates an appreciation of and a love for pure literature. 

2. Its judgments are sound and independent. The author has not gone to current criticism 
for his opinions, but has reached his conclusions and stated them in an attractive and forceful style. 

3. It has the point of view of the historian as well as the litterateur. It cultivates, even 
in young pupils, the sense of time and place and the influences of both upon literary productions. 

4. Its treatment is such as to stimulate the appetite for reading good books, a service for 
young people that can hardly be overestimated. 

5. The author has kept before him constantly the idea of relations and proportion. A back- 
ground for the few prominent names is supplied in thebrief treatment of alarger number of authors. 

Seven groups of portraits. Cloth, with side stamp. Price, $1.00. 



Vergil's JBneid 



Books I.-VI. Complete; Selections from Remaining Books. 

Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary. 
By Charles Knapp, Ph.D., Barnard College, Columbia University. 

This new edition of Vergil will claim the attention of teachers — 

1. Because of its very extensive Introduction, which is of special historical and literary 
value to the student, and is at the same time the most complete treatise on the grammar and 
prosody of Vergil that has appeared in any American text-book. 

2. Because all the long vowels are marked throughout the text. 

3. Because of the scholarly and helpful character of the annotation. 

4. Because the notes are placed on the same page with the text, thus making them con- 
stantly available in the preparation of the lesson. 

5. Because a separate text is supplied for recitation purposes. 

6. Because of its complete vocabulary, its very excellent map, and fine full-page illustrations. 
12mo, half leather, 12 full-page engravings, large map, 620 pages. Price, $1.40. 



College Algebra 



By James Harrington Boyd, Ph.D., University of Chicago. 

The book is distinctly a contribution to the literature of the science of Algebra. It will 
appeal to the progressive teacher because it is written so far as possible from the standpoint of 
modern mathematicians. All the topics for a complete course in college algebra are exhaust- 
ively treated. The extensive lists of new exercises, the numerous practical problems, and the 
graphical illustrations, are all features that will make the book valuable as a text. The com- 
plete system of cross-references makes it practical to use independently any part of the book 
for reading or study.

MA RION HARLA ND says : 

" For we have in the < Hymnal ' one of the most exqoisite pastorals of American life ever written. It is 
an Idyll — a « Reverie,' than which nothing more charming has been offered to our reading public since 
Ik Marvel founded a school of his own fifty-one years ago. . . . Our ' United Country ' is proud of the State 
that has given as within a dozen years Charles Egbert Craddock and this later and gentler painter of 
Tennessee life." 

" There is in the philosophy of this novel something delicionsly sweet and comforting. ... A book of 
this sort occasionally is a delight and an inspiration." — Louisville Tinies. 

"Mr. Moore displays more sentiment than does Mr. Alien, and a shrewder philosophy," — New York 
Times' Saturday Review. 

" Truly, this author of * A Summer Hymnal ' has touched and sustained a high note in novel writing. 
We shall think of him and of his book-people as tenderly as of summer days themselves. He has written 
for our hearts as well as our heads." — Neto York World.

General John M. Palmer bore a great part in building up the State 
of Illinois. Lawyer, politician, soldier, statesman, his name is " writ 
large" in its annals. He was the friend and associate of all the 
great men whom the people of Illinois have honored and loved, and he 
was worthy of their regard. He bore a part in some of the most 
important political events which have transpired in his State and the 
nation during the last half century, and was intimately connected with 
the great actors who were the human agencies that gave to them his- 
torical importance. His book is dedicated to the people of the State of 
Illinois, and especially to the young men who may feel some interest 
in the struggles of one who earnestly sought in his private and public 
relations to be useful in his day and generation. 

PAXSON. 

A Buckeye Baron. 

A Rnral Story of a Buckeye Boy. By W. A. Paxson, of the 

Ohio Bar. Illustrated. 12mo,cloth, gold and colors, $1.50. 

Mr. Paxson, a member of the Oreene County, Ohio, bar, and a 

writer and poet of no mean repute, is giving us of his best in a very 

pleasing story told in his own natural style under the suggestive title 


of " A Buckeye Baron." The scenes of the story are all of Ohio concep- 
tion, mostly in and about those romantic and picturesque spots along 
the Miami River between Clifton and Yellow Springs. The work is 
illustrated by photogravures and pen and ink drawings of a number 
of the most beautiful places thereabouts. The time of the story is about 
the beginning of the Civil War, and the descriptions of the manners 
and customs of Ohio people at that time will surely bring to mind 
many almost-forgotten scenes, and will be a delightful book for the 
winter evening.

Fact and Fancy in Spiritualism, Theosophy

Crown 8vo. cloth, net $1.25; delivered, $1.35. 
Mr. Hubbell combines scientific accuracy with a popular literary 
style that renders his work a desirable addition to the library of every 
person interested in the study of psychic phenomena. The author has 
devoted twenty-five years to a careful study of psychic phenomena, and 
has embodied a large part of the results of that study in this volume. 
The discussion of the more serious phases of these subjects is relieved 
by the narration by the author of some of his own personal experiences 
with mediums. The description of the work accomplished by the 
Society for Psychical Research should be read by every person who 
desires to keep abreast of the times in this field of scientific research. 
The impartiality and fairness with which opposing views are stated 
will commend it to all fair-minded and truth-loving persons.

POPULAR FORMS OF MODERN 
BIO GRAP HY. 

Amid the ebb and flow of literary fashions, biog- 
raphy, one of the earliest forms, has maintained a 
steadfast and increasing carrent of interest. Dar- 
ing the last half-century its appreciation, formerly 
stable but restricted, has pervaded the wider reading- 
public. Nearly twenty-five years ago an English 
critic sought to explain the " temporary rage " 
for biography, and prophesied its speedy retreat 
into its former channel, reserved for scholars and 
critics. This "temporary rage" proved only the 
influx of a popularity which has grown without 
abate, until biography to-day ranks a close second 
to fiction. In America last year the issues of let- 
ters and memoirs outnumbered the records of pre- 
vious years by more than a hundred volumes, and 
elsewhere was a corresponding increase. At the 
public libraries, the demand for biography is fast 
rivalling that for fiction; as additions to private li- 
braries, these life-narratives outrank fiction, poetry, 
and the essay. 

The line of demarkation between literary forms 
is becoming less distinct. There are extremists who 
prophesy its ultimate abolition between prose and 
poetry. Carrent drama and fiction are already cor- 
related and sequential ; history, biography, and crit- 
icism are verging toward common ground. With 
the exception of a few volumes of constitutional 
trend, exampled in the work of Mr. Goldwin Smith, 
latter-day history seems destined to fulfil the doc- 
trine associated with Carlyle's name and become 
"biography of great men." French history of the 
Revolution and the Empire has never been so viv- 
idly presented as in the biographies of Von Hoist 
and Saint- Amand; the lives of Lincoln and Grant 
form popular histories of the Civil War. The present- 
day enthusiasm over historical romance may be 
largely traced to this interest in biographic history. 
The charm of " Hugh Wynne " resides in the pho- 
tographic studies of Washington and Arnold ; the 
most effective scenes in "The Crisis" are the 
revelations of the many-sided nature of Abraham 
Lincoln. 

This infusion of biographic motive into many 
branches of literature, and the demand for remin- 
iscent material, is partly due to the consistent de- 
velopment of biography ; in part, it may be traced 
to the realistic and individualistic tendencies of the 
age. In a true sense all literature is biography — 
the presentation of life. From the earlier to the 
later times, humanity has been divided into two 
classes with unequal ratio : the smaller division — 
in Aristotle's phrase "the contemplative" — have 



120 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



been students of the generic problems of life, phil- 
osophy in its accepted meaning ; the larger circle, 
or "the practical," synthesize universal life through 
the individual, and the prevailing note of current 
civilization is individualism. The greater works of 
early biographical literature were collective. Caesars, 
Saints, Church Fathers, Martyrs, were portrayed in 
group pictures, designed to show their kingly eccle- 
siastic or pietistic traits. Individualism and truth 
often suffered under such mode; qualities were 
strained to make them eligible for inclusion. Cur- 
rent biography, as a rule, is distinctive rather than 
collective ; the tendency of the day is to aggregate, 
not to minimize, volumes. Occasionally a uniform 
series of current biography is so elongated that the 
biographer's imagination and apotheosis alone 
award his subject entrance into the arena of state- 
craft and letters. 

Among collective biographies, two at least have 
become classics : the immortal " Lives " by Plu- 
tarch, well defined as "the pasturage of noble 
minds," and " The Worthies of England," so faith- 
fully "endeavoured" by Thomas Fuller and pub- 
lished posthumously in 1662. This monumental 
work marked an advance in both method and pop- 
ularity; the latter resulted from the former. The 
plan was broad, even democratic, while the style 
had the vitality of the present rather than that of 
the stately encomiums of the past. The great 
philosophic movement of the eighteenth century 
produced, as one exponent, the Biographical Dic- 
tionary of England and the Biographie Universelle 
of France. Combining the critical and romantic, 
they popularized biography and gave it two quali- 
ties of modern forms — realism and vivacity. 

There are three classes of biographers to-day, and 
their distinctive qualities may be traced to both 
evolution and environment. One class are urged by 
ambitious, too often mercenary, motives ; and they 
may treat subjects wholly alien to their tastes 
and powers. They "read up" for their tasks, 
sometimes exhaustively, more often superficially. 
Lacking any sympathetic interest, they assume a 
pert, critical tone, and often desecrate facts and the 
memory of the dead. The second class, more com- 
mon in the past than in the present, are incited by 
didactic and ethical motive. Occasionally, among 
current volumes, is such an aim discerned, openly 
or covertly urging imitation, not seeking illumin- 
ation. The tendency now is to submerge the eth- 
ical beneath the pictorial, to enable the reader to 
gain the lesson intuitively, not emphatically. The 
recent life-records of Kingsley, Drummond, Steven- 
son, and Farkman, are masterly sermons on cour- 
age and aspiration. The recital of the histories of 
Mirabeau or Byron, without a single commentary, 
afford ethical warnings as strong as the intellectual 
stimulus. Mr. John Morley happily mingles the 
pictorial with the confessedly didactic, in both his- 
tory and biography, as his lives of the French 
Revolutionists and the recent study of Cromwell 
attest. 



The third class of biographers include all those 
influenced by pure elegiac truth. Their biographies 
are epics and elegies as truly as "The Odyssey," 
" Moschus," or "In Memoriam." From historical 
interest or personal friendship their memories are 
filled with incident and inspiration which they 
would combine into a memorial. Reverent love is 
the key-note of such biographies, and truth and 
justice are the major strains. Among memoirs 
of this type, four volumes of the past possess per- 
ennial charm, — Boswell's Johnson, Lockhart's 
Scott, Stanley's Arnold, and Mrs. Gaskell's Char- 
lotte Bronte. They are both models and silent 
censors of current biography. Undoubtedly, a part 
of the fame of Boswell's work was due to its ap- 
pearance after a season of dry, pedantic biography. 
It heralded a new portrayal of man's life in its 
entirety, interpreted by loving insight; the vain, 
loquacious fop became exalted into "the prince of 
biographers." His source of incidents was largely 
conversation; from this variety of oral revelations 
he constructed a volume as unique in its origin 
as it was vital in its potency. Lockhart made 
liberal use of letters and journals ; Mrs. Gaskell 
and Dean Stanley formed mosaics of memorials 
and letters, and this method became the favorite 
with modern biographers. A list of recent works 
testifies to the use of this material in title and sub- 
stance : " Life and Letters," " Letters and Me- 
moirs," — such are the interwoven phrases. The 
outburst of criticism which served, as is often the 
case, to popularize the work of Mrs. Gaskell and 
the subsequent volumes of Froude's Carlyle and 
Cross's George Eliot, aroused a discussion, not yet 
silenced, regarding the use of epistolary matter. 
The recent publication of the Browning, Stevenson, 
Bismarck, and Victor Hugo Letters has still further 
agitated the critic's mind. There are misanthropes 
who deride everything that wins popular favor. As 
biography has become vital and thrilling through 
the media of letters and personal reminiscences, 
such critics aver its deterioration, and refer its 
popularity to " that appetite for slander which is 
common to all the sons of Adam, though kept down, 
like other vulgar appetites, by the influence of edu- 
cation and manners." The earlier writers used let- 
ters in the few instances where they existed, but 
their quantity was so scanty that the narratives be- 
came documentary and inferential in tone. When 
Carlyle published the Letters and Speeches of Crom- 
well, in 1845, he placed new value upon such ma- 
terial, and by personal photograph revealed the 
man, who could no longer be veiled as soldier, dic- 
tator, or regicide. Current biographies are still 
documentary, but they are photographic rather than 
conjectural. 

If one questions the legality of use of letters and 
journals, one must inquire the primal purpose of a 
biography. It is not to eulogize, not to moralize, 
not to satirize, but to portray the true character in 
its entirety, to show the many-sided humanity in 
private no less than public life. Such biography 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



127 



meets two distinct social characteristics of the pres- 
ent: individualism and altraism. The man in his 
inner aspirations, faults, and hidden virtues, is por- 
trayed, no less than man as part of the great social 
organism ; we seek to find the animating and com- 
pulsive forces behind the public work. If, then, the 
purpose is to show the truth, without smirch of 
burlesque or veneer of eulogy, of a surety letters 
form the authentic material. With the journal, they 
represent a confessional of aims, moods, affections, 
faults. Cardinal Newman wrote to his sister : 
" It has been a hobby of mine, though perhaps it 
is a truism and not a hobby, that the true life of a 
man is in his letters. . . . Not only for the interests 
of the biography, but for arriving at the inside of 
things, the publication of letters is the true method." 

Against this popular form of epistolary biography 
three arguments have been deduced. First, mal- 
contents affirm that the public has really no interest 
in the inner life of a celebrity, and that such demand 
for information has been created by mercenary, 
sensation-loving biographers. While supply may 
occasionally create a fleeting demand, such reversion 
of law seldom sustains a long life. Undoubtedly 
the publication of the letters of Chesterfield and 
Cromwell and Walpole created an interest in such 
material ; but if such letters had not stimulated the 
readers, the demand would not have become the 
present-day clamor. Second, it is claimed that, 
even if such material does please the public, the 
substance is mere purility, and does not ensure a 
judicial knowledge of the character ; in fact, that 
the reader's pruriency may be pampered, but his 
mental and spiritual nature receives no betterment. 
The answer to such censure lies in the corrective 
force of many current biographies, compiled from 
private epistolary sources, often published with re- 
luctance as defense against calumny. Such has 
been the reverent mission of Mrs. Ritchie's " Mem- 
ories." The publication of Thoreau's " Familiar 
Letters " revealed the hidden heart of of the poet- 
naturalist, and annihilated forever the charge of 
cold, hermit-like character. The tragic anxieties 
of Lanier, and his mystic, unwritten songs, that 
moan for utterance through his letters, tell the story 
of his life as no biographer could do. 

The third objection to the use of letters demands 
more consideration, — " the breach of social pri- 
vacy." This phrase suggests one great stigma upon 
the present age. Independence is still each indi- 
vidual's possession ; privacy seems fast becoming 
obsolete. Four decades ago Dickens suffered, as 
nearly all celebrated visitors have suffered since, 
from America's disregard of private rights and 
seclusion. It seems one of the results of extreme 
democracy that equality and fraternity exclude 
secrecy. This defiance to all decent reserve, this 
prurient curiosity regarding individual tastes in all 
commodities from books to cheese, has encouraged 
the publication of some private letters wherein 
sacred delicacy has been violated with no return 
other than scandal and degradation. To assume, 



however, that the larger proportion of letters and 
journals, when published, violate privacy and de- 
grade the reader, is an extreme and false conclu- 
sion. The readers of Froude's Carlyle, Kingsley's 
Memoirs, or the Love- Letters of the Brownings or 
Victor Hugo, do not rank among the sensation- 
loving public that scans the personal gossip of the 
yellow journals or gloats over the last erotic novel. 
The readers of biography, as a rule, bring a rever- 
ential spirit ; the personality of the subject becomes 
vital to them, and a sense of friendly relation ensues. 
This question of propriety must be submitted to the 
tact and good taste of the editor. In spite of the 
world's great elegies, there will always linger in 
some sensitive minds a doubt whether it is not an 
artificial form, wherein the poet 

" Loves to make iiarade of pain. 
That with his piping he may gain 
The praise that comes to constancy." 

" Margaret Ogilvy " is a tender, exquisite memorial 
to motherhood, yet many questioned before they 
read it — never afterwards — if its publication did 
not suggest a slight irreverence toward the most 
sacred of human bonds. It is true that Browning 
wrote, — 

" God be thanked, the meanest of his creatnres 
Boasts two sool-sides, one to face the world with. 
One to show a woman when he loves her," — 

but he did not affirm that the latter phase should 
be hidden from those who sought with loyal sin- 
cerity to know the entire man. To publish such 
letters during the life-time of their authors would 
violate dignity and personal reserve. Death hal- 
lows such memorials, and bestows upon them an 
illuminating vitality at once universal yet reveren- 
tial. Severe is the task allotted the modern biog- 
rapher who utilizes internal material. A truthful 
portrait does not consist of a series of instantaneous 
photographs. Many trivial incidents are not rep- 
resentative of the true rounded character. Mr. 
Birrell says, with force: " An editor is not a sweep, 
and, by the love he bears the author whose fame 
he seeks to spread abroad, it is his duty to exclude 
what he believes does not bear the due impress of 
the author's mind." 

Biographies of the fervid eulogistic type are still 
occasionally found among current volumes, showing 
that their inoculation has not caused entire preven- 
tion. Such volumes in the past have called forth 
answering depreciations, and the pendulum has 
been long in finding balance. Volumes of argu- 
ment and decades of transforming judgment have 
been required to recover from the severe and reac- 
tionary estimates of Poe and Southey. A peculiar 
temptation assails the family or intimate friends to 
exclude significant defects. A taint of inadequacy 
must cling to a volume of current biography with 
this confession in the preface : " The writer of this 
memorial has not thought it necessary to call at- 
tention to defects in the character she has sought 
to portray." 

Modern biographical subjects have greatly ex- 



128

ceeded the limits of the past. The subjects of earlier 
portrayal were men or women of some special era, — 
leaders of some political or religious movement, — 
St. Augustine, Mahomet, Turgot, Napoleon,Wa8h- 
ington. The spread of social democracy gave new 
interest to wider types of humanity, and the age 
of industrialism has further expanded its confines. 
Carlyle wrote, in his Life of Sterling: "I have 
remarked that a true delineation of the smallest 
man, and his pilgrimage through life, is capable of 
interesting the greatest man." Some of the most 
charming biographies of recent times have made 
alive some humble, uneventful life, with latent ele- 
ments of nobility and genius. Beside the volumes 
of letters of Washington and Wellington recently 
published, are large volumes devoted to the lives 
and letters of the Earl of Selborne, George Borrow, 
and John Donne. The average reader who vaguely 
recalled the last writer as a satirist and poet, quoted 
often by Lowell and Thoreau, could scarcely pre- 
dict such a charming and ennobling life-record as 
that written by Mr. Gosse. One of the most un- 
selfish of lives was that of Dorothy Wordsworth, 
and her inspiration and self-effacement have brought 
to her a merited and tardy fame at the hands of 
biographers and editors. Mr. Pater delighted to 
vivify recondite characters from past history and 
art, and "Marius the Epicurean" is a monument 
to his vivid analysis and matchless style. When 
Mrs. Ward translated the " Journal Intime " of 
Frederic Amiel, she gave English readers a wide 
acquaintance with a life singularly unknown yet re- 
plete with grandeur and poetry. 

Current biography is sufficiently varied to satisfy 
the demands of this complex age of realism, science, 
and romance. As the subjects are extended in num- 
ber, and the incidents are expanded to include 
" the round of littles 
That large life compound," 

80 the forms of modern biography are most diverse. 
The reminiscent and anecdotal type, largely ob- 
jective, dating back to Tacitus and Pliny, is yet 
among the modes of to-day, but it has been ex- 
panded to give psychologic emphasis to the periods 
of adolescence and early manhood, which in the 
past received scanty notice, in the zeal to recount 
mature deeds. A few critics scoff at such " puerili- 
ties," but this is an age of child-study and the public 
greet such anecdotal morsels with avidity. They 
supply the fiction element, and at the same time 
proclaim the scientific perspective. The memory 
of Goethe's mother and her "serial stories" is of 
vital import in tracing the novelist's impulse. The 
little Jane Welsh, at nine years of age, making a 
funeral-pyre of lead-pencils and cinnamon-sticks, 
reciting the speech of Dido, and offering upon the 
altar of childhood her pet doll, is a significant pro- 
phecy of the imaginative, brilliant, neurotic woman. 
In some few recent biographies there is a tendency 
to submerge the serious life-purpose beneath excess 
of episodal trifles ; anecdote and witticism are only 



marginal readings, and a wise biographer has ulte- 
rior aim beyond a collection of after-dinner stories. 

In all subjective biographic forms, letters, journals, 
personal memoirs, the subject is his own photogra- 
pher, yet the editor must carefully adjust the focus 
and plates that the man may be revealed in his true 
entirety. Phillips Brooks well emphasized the triple 
relationship in all biography, — the conferees being 
the subject, the author, and the reader. In the best 
works of past and current times, the subject has the 
vital and undisputed right of way. While the editor 
or narrator should be in the background, and the 
personal element should be eliminated as far as pos- 
sible, yet the presence of a loyal, gifted compiler 
will be subtly felt upon every page. The tendency 
of current biography is to include rather than ex- 
clude the medium of narration, with a distinct loss 
of dignity and perspective. In no other branch of 
literature is greater responsibility thrown upon the 
reader. His part is to become accordant at once, 
to "enter the heart and mind " of both subject and 
guide. A reader's mental and moral calibre are 
easily recognizable in the lasting impression from 
some carefully-edited biography which portrays all 
phases of its subject. The reader whose memory 
retains most vividly the picture of Cromwell's warts 
and Carlyle's dyspepsia, who has classified Cole- 
ridge and DeQuincey and Rossetti as opium-eaters 
first and authors second, who recalls only the awk- 
ward himsquerie of Lincoln and Grant, whose only 
interest in Landor was aroused by the apocryphal 
story that in a passion he threw his cook out of the 
window, — such a reader has written his, or more 
often her, own character-analysis. Biography is 
too sacred and dignified a literary form to meet the 
vapid tastes of this class of readers; it demands 
broad and sympathetic intellection. 

In spite of the increased scope and forms of 
biography, some historic and literary characters 
defy any dramatic or vivid presentation ; toward 
others, the readers of all decades assume a hostile 
tone or an unconscious prejudice. Shakespeare the 
man is still unknown, for he has left few " human 
documents " for reproduction beyond his general 
portrayal through his works, where it is still impos- 
sible to distinguish the subjective touches from the 
objective mastery of mankind. Readers will never 
feel sympathetic admiration for Smollett, Godwin, 
or Southey ; while Shelley and Burns and Irving 
gain warm friends in each generation. Recognizing 
the superior artist in Mendelssohn, the interest 
in his life pales before the casual narrative of 
Beethoven, — 

" O Psalmist of the weak, the strong, 
O Troubadour of Love and Strife." 

The humanity of a subject, rather than his intellect 
or his genius, assures his strongest popularity. 

Many lives that do not readily yield to extended 
biography are admirably adapted to brief critique 
or miniature sketch. Current literature abounds 
in such volumes, a distinct form of later biography.

The studies of Mr. Leslie Stephen, Mr. Hatton, 
and Mr. Gosse belong to the realm of criticisna 
more than of biography, if one is to retain the land- 
marks of the past. The biographic, in condensed 
studies, has its model in " Yesterdays with Authors." 
The pithy, sentient essays of Lowell, Saintsbury, 
Lang, and Birrell, and the later political interpre- 
tations by McCarthy, Lodge, and Higginson, com- 
mingle the narrative and critical elements. The 
popularity of such volumes attests their adaptation 
to the crowded days of the present, with the de- 
mand for the essence and the kernel which the 
scholar shall extract for the public. Charming as 
are such succinct essays, — and they have that 
double charm of the evanescent which Poe empha- 
sized, — they should serve their full purpose as 
suggestion and temporary enjoyment, or as source 
of those clever anecdotes and hon-mots which add 
zest to criticism in general conversation. There is 
meagre danger that they will usurp the place or 
time devoted to careful life-studies ; they are tooth- 
some entrees, well suited to the clever, rushing age 
that has produced them. Nearly all of the most 
popular biographies of the last few years have con- 
sisted of at least two large volumes ; the " Life and 
Letters of Spurgeon," which won enthusiastic read- 
ing and ready sale, aggregated over two thousand 
pages in four bulky volumes. Perhaps this is 
merely a device of the publishers in this mercantile 
age which guages a book's success by aggregations 
in pages and copies sold, which too often confuses 
the " big " with the great ; yet there seems also a 
healthful sign in the earnest and responsive reading 
of voluminous editions of the more serious and in- 
structive literature. 

Biography is the true link between the past and 
the present, and its universal favor is assured. 
Current issues from the press deal with characters 
of all ages. New lives of Robespierre and Danton, 
Jeanne D'Arc and Cromwell, Milton and Shake- 
speare, " The True George Washington " and " The 
Many-Sided Franklin," studies of Da Vinci, Ru- 
bens, and Turner, — one might recount scores of 
volumes, yearly reclothing past scenes and charac- 
ters to suit the tastes of this composite age which 
exacts vitality, accuracy, and literary judgment. 
With reverent skill and scholarship, writers of 
diverse creeds are awakening a world-interest in 
the greatest narrative of all time, the life of Jesus. 
Current biography is an antidote to the enervating 
tendencies of much current fiction and drama ; it 
is one of the safeguards against neurotic, thought- 
less reading ; it is recreative, but it is also stimu- 
lative ; to form a taste for biography should be one 
of the primal aims of parent and teacher. Through- 
out life it ministers to the higher emotional and 
mental natures ; on its pages we read the vital 
lessons of humanity, — " There is no life of a man, 
faithfully recorded, but it is a heroic poem of its 
sort, rhymed or unrhymed."

The Selborne Naturalist.* 



What is the secret of the popularity of "The 
Natural History of Selborne," that it should 
have passed through more than eighty editions 
in little over a century, and still remain the 
great classic in its kind ? It appeals not merely 
to English readers, whom we may suppose to 
be generally familiar with the plants and ani- 
mals it discusses, but almost equally to Ameri- 
cans, who are to some extent without this 
advantage. The explanation lies probably in 
the fact that the author was a prince among 
observers, and that he set down simply and 
without self-consciousness the results of his 
observations. That he was a poet, too, as well 
as a naturalist, helps to explain the charm of 
his book, unless indeed it be true that no ar- 
dent lover of nature can fail to be also a poet. 
A certain stiffness of style characteristic of 
the period is, we must admit, manifest in his 
pages ; but still they hold the attention. Those 
who have the best things to tell us seem to have 
as well the best way of telling them. 

Like many another masterpiece of litera- 
ture, " The Natural History of Selborne " was 
begun more to amuse its author than with any 
thought of publication. Gilbert White's turn 
for metrical composition early inspired some 
of his friends with high hopes for him as a 
poet ; but he disappointed them, and devoted 
himself to studies which, in the end, won him 
a far more enduring fame than any they could 
have predicted for him. His uneventful life 
was passed almost wholly at " The Wakes," his 
modest place at Selborne. Except for the 
year (1752-3) of his proctorship at Oxford, 
he seems to have stirred but little abroad after 
taking his degree. He was a victim of coach- 
sickness, so that his quiet seclusion was partly 
forced upon him. He held an Oriel fellow- 
ship for fifty years, relinquishing it only at 
his death in 1793. His admirers must regret 
that he incurred the odium of being a sinecure 
non-resident and pluralist. Nor does his pious 
descendant and biographer succeed in clearing 
him. He rather befogs the whole matter. 
Though he assures us repeatedy that his great- 
grand-uncle was blameless, and that he never 
accepted any of the college livings offered him,

yet he distinctly tells us that Gilbert White 
did accept the small living of Moreton Pinkney, 
tendered him by Oriel College, and that he 
hired a curate to discharge its duties. For 
twenty-five years, too, he himself was curate 
of Faringdon, still residing at Selborne ; and 
all the while he continued a fellow of Oriel, 
and a non-resident one at that. What in the 
name of honesty does the author mean by as- 
serting, in the footnote to page 100, Volume I., 
that his ancestor never accepted a college liv- 
ing, and then, only three pages farther on, 
calmly recording the fact of his " taking and 
holding with his Fellowship the small college 
living of Moreton Pinkney " ? The sum and 
substance of his labored apology seems to be 
that Gilbert White did only what fellows be- 
fore him had done, and that he suffered no 
qualms of conscience for it. His best friend, 
John Mulso, the holder of several sinecures in 
the church, approved his conduct, and White 
was content. He certainly was not a rich 
man, as has been alleged ; but we wish he had 
avoided even the appearance of evil. 

The work before us is made up largely of 
extracts from the naturalist's diaries, his letters, 
and his friends' letters to him. Thus it serves 
as an admirable supplement to the " Natural 
History," and helps us to know the man him- 
self. In his Kalendar, under date of August 
20, 1765, we have him as a keen-eyed observer 
of all that met his notice. " The water wag- 
tail," he says, " seems to be the smallest En- 
glish bird that walks with one leg at a time : 
the rest of that size and under all hop two 
legs together." Again, dipping at random into 
the letters, we find the poet. The following, 
from a letter to a nephew, has a savor of its 
own : 

" Blank verse is, no doubt, when well conducted, full 
of dignity; but then perfection in that way is so rare, 
that we never had but two or three poems that were 
worth reading. A desire of raising the diction above 
prose pushes men into fustian and bombast. Even the 
great Milton, the father of blank verse, is not always 
free from this vice; but ransacks the whole circle of 
sciences for a set of hard words and rumbling terms 
that make his readers stare." 

Another letter, dated July 1, 1776, contains 
this item of historic interest : 

" As I was visiting last Tuesday at Bramshot I saw 
on the Portsmouth road Burgoyne's light horse march- 
ing down to embark for N. America: the horses were 
fine, and the men fine young fellows; but they all 
looked very grave, and did not seem much to admire 
their destination. The Atlantic is no small frith for 
cavalry to be transported over. The expense will be 
enormous ! " 



Mulso's letters to White are good reading. 
It is a pity that White's to Mulso are lost. A 
little touch of character is betrayed by the 
fact that while Mulso always addressed his 
friend as " my dear Gil," the latter would 
never descend from his high stilts, but, as we 
are told, invariably began his replies with " my 
dear Sir." Even when writing to a nephew, 
he sometimes used this form. It is another 
trait of his character that he would never sit 
for his portrait, having been to some extent 
disfigured by the smallpox in his student days 
at Oxford. Consequently the many good 
illustrations contained in the Life include no 
likeness of Gilbert White himself. 

Though partial deafness overtook the natu- 
ralist in 1774, and somewhat crippled him as 
an inquirer into nature's secrets, he pushed 
his work on to its final publication fifteen years 
later. In January, 1788, he writes that he 
has put his " last hand " to the book, but that 
the index still remains to be prepared, — "an 
occupation full as entertaining as the darning 
of stockings." Writing to the Rev. Ralph 
Churton, in August, he says of his book : 

" The fate of my work is now determined ; and as 
the tree is fallen, it must lie. My brother and nephew 
have spared no expense about it, and particularly on 
the engravings, which have cost a considerable sum. 
This book will as you suppose not be published until 
autumn, when the town begins to fill. In the interim 
the author will be in no small a squeeze ; and will feel 
like a school boy who has done some mischief, and 
does not know whether he is to be flogged for it or 
not." 

The work was well received from the first. Dr. 
Scrope Beardmore, Warden of Merton Col- 
lege, Oxford, in speaking to a nephew of the 
author, made the following prediction : " Your 
uncle has sent into the world a publication 
with nothing to call attention to it but an ad- 
vertisement or two in the newspapers ; but, 
depend upon it, the time will come when very 
few who buy books will be without it." 

In seeking to account for the remarkable 
success of the "Natural History," Mr. Holt- 
White says, among other things : 

" Its author did not, as a boy and young man, enjoy 
the benefit of any instruction in the facts of science; 
instruction which would in our time be dignified with 
the name of a scientific education; but his reasoning 
faculties were strengthened and improved by the study 
of the classical languages, which not only introduced 
him to the noblest literature, but also taught him to be 
logical and careful in thought, and accurate in state- 
ment." 

This biography of the Selborne naturalist 
will prove rather heavy reading to those not

already interested in Gilbert White and his 
writings. The author's zeal and industry in 
tracing family history and pedigree will be 
admired and appreciated by all descendants of 
the Jutae or Viti of Jutland, but may not be 
so warmly applauded by less favored mortals. 
However, it was high time somebody wrote a 
life of Gilbert White, and probably no one 
was better equipped for the task than the pres- 
ent head of the family.

The Ixvkxtory of a Cestury.* 



It is certainly not extraordinary for beings of 
large discourse to look after as well as before, 
but there is something mildly amusing in the 
disposition to make progress move by centu- 
ries, and especially the centuries that end in 
cyphers. So long as the creation stood un as- 
sailed at the year four thousand and four B.C., 
the Teutonic tendency to pursue the history of 
even the newest thing out back to chaos could 
be tolerated if not always cultivated. But now 
that the beginning of things has had such ter- 
rific set-backs that a thousand years are but as 
yesterday, we must draw the line somewhere 
when we attempt to take stock. And after all, 
however it may seem that we discover breath- 
ing-places and post-stations in the development 
of nature and society, every seeming beginning 
is but the climax and close of some other move- 
ment, and one method of parceling out time 
and progress is at bottom quite as arbitrary as 
any other. 

The writers of the articles in the books be- 
fore us plainly feel the awkwardness of start- 
ing from the line. Most of them reach back 
for a flying start at least to the last quarter- 
pole of the eighteenth century, and one or two 
even return to the dewy dawn of memory. As- 
tronomy alone, and very properly too, seems 
to have had any regard for dates, Piazzi hav- 
ing inaugurated the century by discovering 
the planetoid Ceres on the evening of Janu- 
ary 1, 1801. Quite as naturally, few of the 
competitors are able to stop under the pole of 
the year 1900, but trail off shorter or longer 
reaches into the alluring future. 

But on the whole the present volumes consti- 
tute valuable retrospects of the world's prog-

ress, and can be recommended as most genuine 
instruments of culture to those who will read 
them with care. It is one of the most serious 
drawbacks of our specializing age that each 
tenth of mankind is as a rule too ignorant of 
what the other nine-tenths are doing and think- 
ing about. While this knowledge can indeed 
be obtained by a wide and constant reading of 
periodical literature, it is just this reading for 
which the busy man lacks time. And, besides, 
one year brings announcements of achieve- 
ments and discoveries which the next year re- 
verses and ridicules. Only the specialist is 
competent to sift year by year the solid and 
permanent from the transient chaff. In these 
volumes, and so far as they cover the field of 
human interests, we have this work done for us 
by competent judges, and in terms intelligible 
to all. It is the ambition of the man of cul- 
ture to be reasonably well-informed on all im- 
portant fields outside his special profession or 
interests. These volumes afford him an oppor- 
tunity to obtain this information under intel- 
ligent guidance and within practicable propor- 
tions. 

And not only will the reading furnish the 
desired information, but the comparison and 
the differing methods of the two volumes will 
afford ground for many interesting observa- 
tions regarding the scope of human interests 
and the differing emphasis placed upon them 
by different men. For instance, the first of our 
two volumes contains articles on the following 
subjects : Evolution, Chemistry, Archaeology, 
Astronomy, Philosophy, Medicine, Surgery, 
Electricity, Physics, War, Naval Ships, Liter- 
ature, Engineering, and Religion. While there 
is no subject here on which the citizen of the 
world will not wish to be informed, no one can 
help wondering at the curious order of the 
topics and at the many staring gaps in the 
list. Electricity receives a chapter in addition 
to physics, and surgery in addition to medi- 
cine ; while commerce, sociology, history, gov- 
ernment, and the arts, aside from literature, 
are ignored. Each of the topics named is 
treated by a single eminent writer, including 
such names as Wallace, Mahan, and Lang, ex- 
cepting religion, which confesses its peculiar 
standing in the world by requiring consider- 
ation from four different points of view, and a 
space of 127 pages as compared with 40 for 
the average. 

The method of the second volume differs 
at the very beginning, in attacking the task in 
eight larger groups of subjects : Law and Gov-

eminent, History, Sociology, Literature and the 
Fine Arts, Education and Science, Applied 
Science, Transportation, and The Science of 
War. As will be seen, this plan includes 
the topics omitted from the plan of the other 
volume, but in its turn it ignores philosophy, 
archaeology, and religion, save for a single 
article on Evolution and Religious Concep- 
tions, although these topics might have found 
room under one or another of the larger heads. 
Neither volume touches the sciences of phil- 
ology and psychology, in both of which the 
nineteenth century made marvelous achieve- 
ments ; nor charities, nor penology, nor social- 
ism, all of which have been paramount inter- 
ests with the foremost rank of mankind during 
the past hundred years. 

Our second volume has no less noble a list 
of contributors to display than the first, among 
them Leslie Stephen, Andrew Lang, Simon 
Newcomb, Edmund Gosse, Horace White, and 
Kenyon Cox. But it has, on the whole, a 
more local, a narrower, point of view than the 
first volume. With all the neglect of great 
and absorbing subjects, it yet has the heart to 
furnish articles on The Gold Standard and 
Gold Production, The Development of Steel 
Manufacture, American Life Assurance, " Psy- 
chical Research," Printing and Railroad Econ- 
omy. A notable peculiarity of the general plan 
of the second volume, which should almost re- 
ceive recognition in the title of the book, is 
its distinctive Americanism. Eight or nine of 
the thirty-seven articles are expressly limited to 
the American side of the subject, while many 
more are treated with more or less special ref- 
erence to the American point of view. Thirty 
of the thirty-seven writers are Americans- 
There is perceptible, also, a little more of the 
tendency to glorify the century just past, to 
the discredit of earlier times. 

Among so many vastly interesting topics by 
such eminent authorities it would lead too far 
to attempt detailed comment. The reading of 
them ought to make a profound impression of 
gratitude and optimism, not one of mere infla- 
tion and conceit, at seeing " Wie wir's dann 
zuletzt so herrlich weit gebracht." If some 
chapters make this impression of gratitude 
more than others, they are probably those on 
medicine, surgery, and astronomy, in which 
both volumes have a somewhat similar story 
to tell. Both are well printed and worthy of 
preservation as well as careful reading.

The Paston Ijetters.* 



The Paston Letters are far from being the 
annals of a quiet neighborhood, although the 
familiar correspondence of an English family 
whose position was originally that of small 
gentry. For their time is those eventful years 
in English history when the white rose of York 
and the red rose of Lancaster were dyed a 
common color on Wakefield Heath and Bos- 
worth Field. 

The intense human interest of these famous 
letters has commanded the admiration of read- 
ers ever since John Fenn edited them, — or, 
rather, those then known, — in 1787. It re- 
mained for Mr. Gairdner, in 1872-5 to give 
them to the world in what then seemed as 
complete form as could be hoped for, since 
some of them were supposed to be irretriev- 
ably lost. At first sight, the present set of 
volumes would seem to be a reprint of that 
edition ; but a more careful examination dis- 
closes that this is not the case. An entirely 
revised preface and introduction have been pre- 
pared, and the welcome information is given 
that above a hundred newly-discovered letters 
have been added. The story of the errant ways 
of the leaves of this famous correspondence is 
told by the editor in the preface. Between this 
and the supplement of letters hitherto unedited 
is the admirable historical introduction. 

Our knowledge of the social life of the men 
and women of the Middle Ages is not great ; 
but so much is known that it is not for us to 
cast imputation upon either our forefathers' 
knowledge or their culture or their attainments 
in the fifteenth century. In an age of blood 
and iron, like our own, they yet felt that the 
essence of civilization was not in material in- 
vention or mere political achievement, but in 
the sway of principles of mind and heart. The 
amount of education possessed by the common 
people of England in that day was not slight. 
Mr. Gairdner truly observes that 
"These letters show that during the century before the 
Reformation the state of education was by uo means so 
low, and its advantages by no means so exceptionally 
distributed, as we might otherwise imagine. For it is 
not merely that Judge Paston was a man of superior 
cultivation, and took care that his family should be 
endowed with all those educational advantages that he 
had possessed himself. This was no doubt the case. 
But it must be remembered that the majority of these 
letters were not written by members of the Paston

family, but were only addressed to tbem ; and they 
show that friends, neighbors, lords, commoners, and 
domestic servants possessed the art of writing, as well 
as the Fastens themselves. No person of any rank or 
station in society above mere laboring men seem to 
have been wholly illiterate. All could write letters; 
most persons could express themselves in writing with 
ease and fluency." 

In 1479, William Paston, a lad of ninetecD, 
is at Eton "versifying" in Latin hexameters 
and sending his effusion to an elder brother 
for criticism, which implies a classical training 
in the latter also. Sir John Paston's library 
contained (and his letters show that he read 
them with pleasure) Chaucer's " Troilus and 
Cressida," " The Legend of Good Women," 
" The Parliament of Birds," '• La Belle Dame 
Sans Mercie," and Lydgate's " Temple of 
Grlass," though the circumstance that one of 
the landed possessions of the family, the manor 
of Gresham, had been purchased from the son 
of the first laureate, may have increased Sir 
John's interest in that poet. The Shakespeare 
scholar will be even more interested in these 
letters, for in their pages Sir John Falstaff — 
or Fastolf, as the name is properly spelled — 
appears in veritable reality, not as a type of 
the pseudo-chivalry of the fifteenth century. 
Judge Paston was executor of Falstaff's will, 
and the latter left his fairest po8session,Caister 
Castle, to him, with the understanding that the 
property be ultimately devoted to the founding 
of a college wherein were to be maintained 
"seven priests and seven poor folk." The 
spirit of the will was faithfully kept by his ex- 
ecutor, who, finding it impracticable to found 
an independent institution in Norfolk, devoted 
O^ister to the support of Magdalen College. 
If Shakespeare perverted Falstaff in order to 
point the moral of decadent feudalism, yet in 
one particular he was not altogether unfaith- 
ful to his character. Falstaff — yet Shallow 
more so — was fond of interlarding his con- 
versation with legal terms. His numerous let- 
ters to Judge Paston regarding the execution 
of his will attest his familiarity with the intri- 
cacies of the law touching property. 

The claims of property are continually thrust 
upon the reader of these letters. Betrothal or 
marriage where the question of dowry was not 
considered, even between those outside the 
aristocracy, were deemed scandalous, and the 
finer sensibilities of both men and women were 
singularly blunt. Yet they were not without 
sentiment. The love correspondence of John 
Paston and Margery Brews is a curious com- 
pound of sense and sentiment. The girl's 



father long held back with reference to the 
match. Writing to the elder Paston, he says : 
" The cause of my wryting un to yow, at thys tyme 
is, I fele wele . . . that ye hafe undyrstondyng of a 
mater, whech is in commynicacyon tochyng a maryage, 
with Godds grace, to be concluded betwyx my saide 
cosyn yowr broder, and my doghter Margery, wheche 
is far commonyd, and not yyt concluded, ner noght 
schall ner may be tyll I hafe answer from yowe." 

Margery was loyal to her father's wishes and 
the custom of the country, but her woman's 
heart was sad at times. " If that ye hade not 
halfe the lyvelode that ye hafe, for to do the 
grettest labur that any woman on lyve myght, 
I wold not forsake yowe," she writes on St. 
Valentine's Day, to " My ryght welebeloved 
Voluntyn." 

The quality of the sentiment of the fifteenth 
century seems hard to us. We may admire 
more the simplicity and honesty of the people 
as a whole. One John Gy wne, a servant, finds 
a purse on the highway near Cambridge, and 
sends it to his master at Trinity College to 
know if any of his knowledge, or any other, 
have lost such a purse, and that the tokens 
thereof being told he shall have it again. An 
unknown man, evidently young, writes to his 
friend in Lincoln, who is of superior station, 
in a letter of straightforward friendship and 
manly purpose: "A man shall never have love 
of God, nor love nor dread of good men for 
miskeeping of much good as though it were 
his own ; but where it is truly dealt with and 
goodly disposed then followeth both great 
merit and worship." 

Space fails to tell of the minute things of 
interest in this correspondence. The student 
of economic and social history, the purely po- 
litical historian, the genealogist, and the an- 
tiquarian will all find a mine of profitable 
study in these pages, which so conclusively 
prove that history is not the study of dead 
peoples but the mirror of humanity.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



of Edward John Phelps, Diplomat and States- 
man," which is now before us. 

Mr. Phelps was so prominent a public char- 
acter up to the time of his demise, and his 
views on burning questions of the hour were 
so well known, that the thoughtful reader of 
the present day will be glad to possess those 
views in a convenient and enduring form. But 
the volume will serve another end. It will 
stamp the author and his opinions as worthy 
products of the best of which American insti- 
tutions and American life is capable, and it 
will pass down to future generations the pa- 
triotism and scholarship of one of the first men 
of our time. 

In his address before the American Bar 
Association, on Chief Justice Marshall and 
the constitutional law of his time, Mr. Phelps 
brought out what he conceived to be some of 
the true elements of greatness in the great 
jurist. These utterances were so original, so 
comprehensive, and so eminently fair withal, 
that they won for the author the highest en- 
comiums from this very conservative body. 
Here is an illustration : 

«' It is not, in my judgment, as a great judge merely, 
or in comparison with other great judges, that Chief 
Justice Marshall will have his place in ultimate history. 
The test of historical greatness — the sort of greatness 
that becomes important in future history — is not great 
ability merely. It is great ability combined with great 
opportunity, greatly employed. The question will be, 
how much a man did to shape the course of human 
affairs, or to mould the character of human thought. 
Did he make history, or did he only accompany and 
embellish it ? Did he shape destiny, or was he carried 
along by destiny ? These are the inquiries that pos- 
terity will address to every name that challenges per- 
manent admiration, or seeks a place in final history. 
Now, it is precisely in that point of view, as it appears 
to me, and I venture to present the suggestion, that 
adequate justice has not yet been done to Chief Justice 
Marshall. He has been estimated as the lawyer and 
the judge, without proper consideration of how much 
more he accomplished, and how much more is due him 
from his country and the world, than can ever be due 
to the mere lawyer or judge. The assertion may per- 
haps be regarded as a strong one, but I believe it will 
bear the test of reflection, and certainly the test of 
reading in American history, that, practically speaking, 
we are indebted to Chief Justice Marshall for the 
American Constitution. I do not mean the authorship 
of it, or the adoption of it — although in that he had a 
considerable share, — but for that practical construction, 
that wise and far-seeing administration, which raised it 
from a doubtful experiment, adopted with great hesi- 
tation, and likely to be readily abandoned if its practical 
working had not been successful, — raised it, I say, from 
a doubtful experiment to a harmonious, a permanent, 
and a beneficent system of government, sustained by 
the judgment and established in the affection of the 
people. He was not the commentator upon American 



constitution law; he was not the expounder of it; he 
was the author, the creator, of it. The future Hallam, 
who shall sit down with patient study to trace and 
elucidate the constitutional history of this country — 
to follow it from its origin, through its experimental 
period and its growth to its perfection, to pursue it 
from its cradle, not I trust to its grave, but rather to 
its immortality, — will find it all, for its first half- 
century, in those luminous judgments in which Mar- 
shall, with an unanswerable logic, and a pen of light, 
laid before the world the conclusions of his court. It 
is all there, and there it will be studied by future gen- 
erations. The life of Marshall was itself the constitu- 
tional history of the country from 1801 to 1835." 

Mr. Phelps discusses the American Com- 
monwealth in a lengthy essay, taking as his 
text some views expressed by Mr. Bryce in his 
book on that theme. There is much food for 
thought and investigation in this paper. Mr. 
Phelps is inclined to the opinion that many of 
the evils of representative government are the 
" outcome of a vicious and altogether unneces- 
sary enlargement of the electorate," and " are 
not the natural consequence of free institu- 
tions. American politics have simply been de- 
based and corrupted by admitting to the right 
of suffrage the class who are utterly unfit for 
it." He argues that " if from every constitu- 
ency there was eliminated every man who could 
not prove, by his neighbors, that he had the 
reputation of a decent and respectable life and 
character, public affairs would be improved 
thereby. The demagogue would, of course, ob- 
ject to this. The material thus excluded from 
the electorate is his stock in trade. But his loss 
would be the nation's gain. Representative 
government would rise, as political handicraft 
declined." 

This is not the place to discuss these views 
at length. It is enough for our present purpose 
to say that the history of municipal experiment 
shows the necessity of some such radical change 
as is here suggested. These utterances empha- 
size the courage of Mr. Phelps, as well as the 
constructive quality of his mental fibre. 

The volume is replete with thoughts that 
could well pass as maxims. We will quote only 
a few: 

•' The gift of prophecy is mercifully withheld from 
man. Hope, kindlier than prophecy, stands in the place 
of it, — the just and reasonable hope, instructed by what 
has gone before." 

" The man who makes no mistakes does not usually 
make anything." 

" There is no ultimate support for law but in na- 
tional enthusiasm. It must appeal to the heart as well 
as to the reason." 

" The test of all political theories, however erudite 
and plausible, must be found in experience." 

" No demagogue, no self-seeker, no man who ' f ol-

liberty or has advanced the cause of human freedom a

The book is prefaced with an appreciative 
memoir by the Hon. John W. Stewart, ex- 



Governor of Vermont.

Recent Fiction.* 



The Indian seems to be coming back into Amer- 
ican fiction. By this we mean, not the Indian of 
to-day, as he is depicted for us by those writers of 
the younger school who have observed him at first 
hand in the Southwest, nor the Indian in his char- 
acter as a victim of corrupt politics, as he is pre- 
sented in the stirring pages of " Ramona," but 
rather the Indian of the earlier time of which 
Cooper wrote, the Indian of romance proper and of 
the heroic age of the American pioneer. Miss 
Mary Johnston brought back this type of Indian 
for our sympathy and admiration in her vigorous 
portrayal of life in colonial Virginia, and we have 
just now two historical romances, strikingly similar 
in theme, which serve to recall the youthful days 
in which we read, with breathless attention, of the 
last of the Mohicans, and the tragedy of the dark 
and bloody ground. Mr. Burton Egbert Stevenson's 
" A Soldier of Virginia " is not altogether an Indian 
story, but its chief interest centres about Braddock's 
ill-fated expedition, and the savage strategy which 
struck with panic and disaster his unfortunate fol- 
lowers. Colonel Washington figures pleasantly in 
this narrative, although the post of hero is reserved 
for his imaginary friend Stewart, who takes an 
active part in the campaign, and at once wins mili- 
tary renown and the love of the charming heroine. 

The second of these books is " The Wilderness 
Road," from the practiced and skilful hand of Mr.

Joseph A. Altsheler, whose name always guarantees 
a vigorous and manly tale, true to the essentials of 
historical fact, and of sustained and exciting inter- 
est. This is a romance of the campaign against 
the Indians at the close of the eighteenth century, 
the campaign which seemed to end in disaster with 
the defeat of St. Clair's forces, but which achieved 
a lasting success a few years later under the leader- 
ship of Anthony Wayne. One of Mr. Altsheler's 
earlier heroes again occupies the foreground in this 
book — the John Lee who suffered unmerited dis- 
grace through the villainy of a relative, and who 
left the Continental army to seek his fortunes in 
the West. As the central figure in the present 
tale, he achieves distinction in border warfare, and 
the stigma is removed from his name through the 
devoted efforts of the courageous woman whose 
love he has won. The scene of his restoration to 
rank and honor in Philadelphia, after his return 
from the field of Wayne's victory, is highly thrill- 
ing, and must be reckoned one of the author's most 
successful efforts. 

" D'ri and I " is a particularly obnoxious title 
for a book, and creates an initial prejudice not easy 
to overcome. Since the story is written by Mr. 
Irving Bacheller, and follows close upon the success 
of " Eben Holden," it is assured of a numerous 
clientele of readers, and no title could interfere 
greatly with its vogue. It begins like its predeces- 
sor, with a man and a boy, working their pioneer 
way through the wilderness of northern New York. 
It is needless to add that " D'ri " is " Eben " under 
a new name, but practicing the old rustic speech 
and the old homely philosophy. The time is early 
in the present century, and the chief incidents are 
more or less directly connected with the War of 
1812. The book is one of detached episodes rather 
than a continuous narrative of organic plan, and 
we must say that the episodes themselves, although

strikingly unhackneyed, are far f rona being distinctly 
worked out. In fact, the story bears marks of 
undue haste in its preparation, and moves along 
with little regard for either unity of design or finish 
of execution. The book has a noticeably pretty 
cover, and shows otherwise marks of the good taste 
that characterizes the recent work of its publishers. 

Mr. Hancock's novel, " Henry Bourland," de- 
serves to share the favor which the public has been 
bestowing on " The Crisis." It is a novel of almost 
the same period, and almost as good. There are 
certain tricks of craftmanship which Mr. Churchill 
has learned to perform more successfully than Mr. 
Hancock, but the two books are about equally 
matched in their consciousness of the deep gravity 
of the historical period with which they deal, and 
in their power to interpret the passion of the Civil 
War to the generation that has grown up since the 
days of Gettysburg and Appomattox. The differ- 
ence is that Mr. Hancock writes with Virginian 
sympathies, and the lost cause does not seem to him 
to have been a wholly unrighteous one. Another 
difference is that " Henry Bourland " is only fairly 
well started when the surrender of Lee's army is 
reached, for the novel is concerned less with the 
war itself than with the period of reconstruction 
that followed. There are several indications in 
both serious and fictive recent literature that the 
time has come for a true appraisal of the life of 
that period in the South, of the acts and devices by 
means of which the white man regained his political 
ascendancy, and saved civilization from an intoler- 
able menace if not from an irretrievable disaster. 
The means were not those which honorable men 
like to use, but when civilization itself seems to be 
at stake, even honorable men will not reckon the 
cost of saving it too closely. This novel stands 
with Mr. Page's " Red Rock " as a vivid picture of 
the struggle against scalawags, negro politicians 
and white carpet-baggers, and we do not believe 
that either novelist has colored his canvas unfairly. 
But it remains true that we cannot touch pitch 
without defilement, and the most impressive moral 
lesson of Virginia history is unfolded in the story 
of Mahone's conspiracy against the honor of the 
State. Readjustment the wise called it, but the 
world knows that it was repudiation. With this 
subject the latter chapters of Mr. Hancock's book 
are concerned, and we cannot help tracing its con- 
nection with the episodes of illegal voting and 
intimidation of which we have been reading a little 
earlier. 

Mr. Frank Norris has evidently determined to 
become the American Zola. The brutal realism of 
his first books indicated a marked intention of fol- 
lowing in the footsteps of his French prototype, and 
all that was needed to make the parallel complete 
was the invention of some large scheme of social 
portrayal which should link together a series of 
semi-independent novels. Such a scheme he has 
now elaborated, and the general subject of the pro- 
jected series is indicated by " The Epic of the 



Wheat," its collective title. Three books are 
planned, dealing respectively with the production, 
the distribution, and the consumption of our chief 
agricultural product. The first book of the series, 
" The Octopus," is a story of the struggle between 
the wheat-growers of California and the railroad 
company upon which they are dependent for access 
to their market. " The Pit," taking us to Chicago, 
will follow; and "The Wolf," shifting the scene to 
Western Europe, will complete the trilogy. This 
is a large conception, and Mr. Norris has dealt 
with its first phase in a manner that cannot fail to 
win respect and even admiration, in spite of the 
defects of a method that is essentially inartistic. 
With him, as with M. Zola, realism means the 
piling up of great masses of trivial fact, reporting 
in place of true characterization, and the enforce- 
ment of his argument by the bludgeon rather than 
by the rapier. Allowing for all that may be urged 
against the methods of railway companies in gen- 
eral, and in particular against the methods of the 
corporation that has held California within its con- 
stricting tentacles, we think that Mr. Norris has 
shown himself too evidently a partisan of the agri- 
culturist, and has failed to deal impartially with the 
forces that contend for mastery in his pages. If 
only he had given the devil his due, we might be 
willing to admit the diabolic character of the cor- 
poration which he assails ; as it is, we are rather 
inclined to sympathize with the octopus, which 
stands, after all, for practices that come within the 
form of law, whereas the practices of the wheat- 
growers stand for the most part without the law, 
and illustrate nearly every form of violence and 
anarchy. If the writer means to preach anything, 
it is that a certain degree of outrage justifies indi- 
viduals in taking the law into their own hands, and 
this is the most dangerous sophistry that now con- 
fronts our civilization. We have little doubt, for 
example, that if Mr. Norris were writing of an 
earlier generation in California, he would be on the 
side of the Vigilance Committees rather than on 
the side of law and order. But his book is made 
an impressive one by virtue of its mere bulk and 
overwhelming particularity, as well as by certain 
dramatic episodes that are presented with remark- 
able vividness and intensity of feeling. And the 
vein of mysticism that crops out here and there is 
not only distinctly Zolaesque, but also provides a 
welcome relief from the oppressive atmosphere of 
the narrative. 

A not dissimilar theme has been chosen by Mr. 
Charles K. Lush for his novel called " The Auto- 
crats." In this book the allied forces of capital 
and corruption are shown at work under municipal 
conditions, and the struggle is between the people 
of a great Western city and the franchise-grabbers 
who operate the system of local transportation. 
The methods employed by the traction companies 
to enrich themselves by means of iniquitous legis- 
lation are laid bare with merciless surgery, and 
those of us who live in cities know only too well

how trathfal is the analysis. Mr. Lash brings to 
his task both knowledge and sincerity, and adds a 
fine element of indignation to his account of the 
situation described. These are qaalities that win 
oar respect, althoagh we feel all the time that the 
writer has little of the novelist's essential equip- 
ment. His characters are abstractions, and his 
powers of invention are far from remarkable. If 
the problem with which he is concerned were not 
one of vital present interest to our civic life, he 
would have no close hold upon his readers as a 
8tory-t«ller. We follow him with absorbing inter* 
est, but it is the same kind of interest with which 
we should follow a history of Tammany Hall or of 
the operations of the late Jay Gould. It is not the 
interest of art, but of politics or of sociology. 

" The Puppet Crown," by Mr. Harold MacGrath, 
is a story of romantic adventure fashioned after the 
model of " The Prisoner of Zenda," and not greatly 
inferior to that entertaining production. The scene 
is a small kingdom in Southeastern Europe, invented 
for the occasion, ruled over by a weak monarch, 
and menaced by a neighboring state, to which, in 
fact, it is mortgaged. There are two heroes and 
two heroines. The former are an Englishman of 
fabulous wealth, intent upon saving the kingdom 
for its people, and a dashing young American dip- 
lomate. who scents danger from afar, and always 
finds himself in the thick of it. The heroines are 
the princess of the kingdom and the beautiful bat 
unscrupulous duchess who sways the fortunes of the 
rival power. The story is extremely animated, and 
presents a bewildering succession of intrigues, and 
adventures, and hairbreadth escapes. It is envel- 
oped in a semi-humorous atmosphere, but, on the 
whole, takes itself seriously enough to appeal rather 
deeply to the sympathies. It is one of the best of 
the class of romances to which it belongs, and we 
confidently recommend it for good summer reading. 

'* Graustark," by Mr. George B. McCutcheon, is 
another romance of the same general type, only in 
this case the writer has thrown all considerations of 
verisimilitude to the winds, and indulged in the fan- 
tastic license of the newspaper reporter. It is one 
of the larkiest of tales, made racy by slangy speech 
and houffe invention. Curiously enough, this story, 
like the one before mentioned, deals with the for- 
tunes of a petty state in the same part of the world, 
mortgaged to an unfriendly neighbor, and rescued 
from its difficulties by the daring of the young 
American who becomes enamoured of its princess. 

" The Kidnapped Millionaires," by Mr. Fred- 
erick Upham Adams, is an audacious story of the 
capture of half a dozen of our wealthiest men, their 
conveyance on a private yacht to an inaccessible 
spot on the Mexican coast, their stay in this en- 
forced seclusion for some months, and their event- 
ual escape and safe return. Incidentally, the book 
is a picture of the most lurid form of journalistic 
enterprise, a graphic account of Wall Street in its 
most exciting phase, and a serious discussion of the 
trast problem, together with its possible solution. 



The book teems with actuality, and makes an in- 
teresting story, except for the chapters in which 
the trusts are dealt with, and these may easily be 
skipped. The personalities concerned are so thinly 
disguised that no difficulty is offered in attaching 
to the figures their real names. Such a cognomen 
as Andras Carmody speaks for itself, and we quickly 
recognize Simon Pence when he tells us that he 
stops his clock every night to save it from wearing 
out too fast. The taste of this sort of exploitation 
of well-known characters is rather dubious, but Mr. 
Adams is so effective a narrator that much may be 
forgiven for the sake of his interesting inventions. 
Without any pretence to the possession of literary 
art, " The Kidnapped Millionaires " provides ex- 
cellent entertainment, and even food for serioos 
thought, in the case of the financial questions 
brought under discassion. 

The book written by Mr. Arthur R. Ropes and 
Miss Mary E. Ropes, entitled '* On Peter's Island," 
is a somewhat belated narrative of the Russian 
revolutionary movement in the early eighties. In 
fact the book was planned as long ago as that, 
which accounts for its rather old-fashioned man- 
ner. These nihilistic plots and counterplots, with 
their natural outcome of criminal act and merciless 
suppression, have lost most of their freshness for 
twentieth centary readers, and it requires an effort 
to think back to the period in which they were 
essentially real. Much extraneous matter is here 
united with the nihilist framework of the story, 
and there is very little organic connection between 
its several parts. In a number of cases, our inter- 
est gets well started in some particular direction, 
when we find that we are pursuing a by-way of the 
narrative, and our attention is sharply diverted. 
We cannot say much for the book as a whole ; it 
is too loose in construction and too rambling in 
style to prove effective. Two or three fairly strik- 
ing dramatic situations help the interest out, bat 
they are not skilfolly welded into the substance of 
the story. 

A woman of country breeding and little educa- 
tion, but of finely-endowed character and marked 
physical charm, finding herself rather thoughtlessly 
married to a man who turns oat to be generally 
worthless, besides specifically anfaithful, she de- 
termines to leave him, and seek to earn her own 
living. Coming to Chicago, she finds employment 
in a publishing-house and a long struggle with pov- 
erty begins. Presently, she finds herself drawn 
into the companionship of a young man who occu- 
pies a responsible position with her employers, and 
love appears as the natural sequence of their re- 
lations. They decide to live together as man and 
wife, and are successful in imposing apon society. 
The man has refinement and generous impulses, 
but the weakness of his character is such that when 
the worthless husband dies, the relation is not 
immediately made legitimate. The realization of 
this despicable trait in the man to whom she has 
given herself determines her upon a second separa-

tion, which is about to be accomplished, when the 
man is aroused to a sense of his dastardly conduct 
and makes what atonement is in his power. This 
is " The Story of Eva," told for us with much art 
and sensibility by Mr. Will Payne, who has made 
a clear advance upon his earlier work. It is all 
skating on thin ice, no doubt, but the situation is a 
perfectly legitimate one for a novelist, and Mr. 
Payne has treated it with good taste, and with no 
touch of offensiveness. He has pathos at his com- 
mand, and the gift of vivid sympathy. His method 
is one of minute realism, but we hasten to add that 
it is the realism of Mr. Howells, and not that of 
M. Zola. Indeed, as much might be inferred from 
what we have already said. The character of the 
heroine is presented with singular charm, and even 
the hero is made to seem deserving of a sort of 
qualified forgiveness before we take leave of him. 

Mr. Max Pemberton always contrives to tell a 
good story, and to secure a certain artistic finish in 
the minute details that is a constant source of sat- 
isfaction to the critical reader. In " Pro Patria " 
he has told an even better story than is his wont, 
having for his theme an attempt of the French gov- 
ernment to invade England by means of a secretly- 
constructed tunnel beneath the English Channel. 
How this attempt was discovered by an officer of 
the English army, and foiled by his persistent, and 
for a time unthanked, vigilance, is the plot which 
we are invited to contemplate. The weak point of 
the story is that it requires us to believe that a work 
of this gigantic description, involving the united 
efforts of thousands of men, could be carried nearly 
to completion without the secret's leaking out. This 
inevitable difficulty is fairly realized by the author, 
who does his best to give an air of probability to 
the situation, but it remains a nearly insuperable 
difficulty despite his best efforts. Another thing 
that strains credulity is the fact that the warning of 
the English officer is unheeded by the War Depart- 
ment ; such carelessness would b6 simply impossible, 
no matter how preposterous seeming the tale brought 
to the attention of the officials. But the story re- 
mains a good one, for all of this inherent flaw, and 
we have enjoyed it thoroughly. 

Mr. E. F. Benson once more gives evidence of 
his remarkable versatility in "The Luck of the 
Vails," which is as different as can be from 
" Dodo," on the one hand, and from his novels of 
the Greek war of liberation, on the other. It turns 
out to be an essentially melodramatic novel of En- 
glish life, involving the fortunes of a young noble- 
man, whose life is menaced by the ingenious 
machinations of the hoary-headed scoundrel who, 
in the event of the hero's death, will succeed to the 
estate. Failing to thwart the proposed marriage of 
Lord Vail, this interesting and subtle contriver of 
villainies seeks to do away with him in a surprising 
variety of fashions. An ancestral jewel has an 
inscription warning the possessor of danger from 
frost, fire, and rain. In seeking to ally himself 
with the fate that hangs over the young man's 



head, the villain invokes all three of these agencies, 
one after another, and only a series of happy acci- 
dents prevents his fell purpose from being accom 
plished. We must say that a hero who is so dense 
to the warning suggestions of his friends, and who 
remains unsuspicious of the person who thus seeks 
his life, hardly deserves the luck which attends him 
throughout the history, but since the story could 
not exist at all without this requirement, and since 
it is a rather thrilling story to read, we must accept 
this weak feature for the sake of the strong ones. 

Mr. Rider Haggard's " Lysbeth " must be de- 
scribed as a pot-boiler. It has not even the imper- 
fect powers of imagination and characterization 
that saved his earlier books from being mere rub- 
bish, and of historical atmosphere there is hardly 
a trace, although the scene is laid in one of the 
most fascinating of historical periods. Briefly, it is 
a tale of the Spanish persecutions in the Nether- 
lands, and has all the stock figures that we asso- 
ciate with this hackneyed setting. Mr. Haggard 
has enough invention to keep the story going, and 
that is about all we can say in his favor. 

One of the most entertaining of the many novels 
written by the late Grant Allen will be found in 
" Linnet," a romance of the Tyrol in particular, 
and cosmopolitan Europe in general. It is the 
story of a Tyrolese girl who becomes a famous 
singer, and of an English poet and composer who 
loves her in her primitive unsophisticated days, who 
is separated from her by her marriage with her 
mercenary manager, and who, when the husband 
is conveniently disposed of by the very useful vil- 
lain, achieves the desire of his heart. Linnet is a 
singularly charming person and she at once wins 
her way to a place in. our affections. A capitally 
conceived secondary figure is that of the hero's 
friend and companion, a critic whose glib speech 
and pretentious assumption of omniscience furnishes 
entertainment at all times, and who turns out to be 
a cad of the basest type. The neatness of Mr. 
Allen's craftsmanship and the ingenuity of his in- 
vention were never better displayed than in this 
bright and animated story. 

A novel by the author of " The Gadfly " is sure 
to attract attention, and we opened Mrs. Voynich's 
" Jack Raymond " with high anticipations of pleas- 
ure. They were not rewarded, for the book is 
about as unpleasant a performance as we have met 
with of recent years. To say this is not to deny 
it the possession of much force and feeling ; un- 
fortunately, these qualities are exhibited in connec- 
tion with a story that has little unity of design, and 
that is based in considerable part upon motives of 
perverted sexuality. " There are some vices whose 
grotesqueness stirs us more deeply than downright 
atrocities," says Mr. Morley, writing of the " Con- 
fessions " of Rousseau, and the text is suggested to 
us by more than one episode of the book before us. 
We do not wish to take a narrow view of any form 
of art, but if ever the rule of reticence demands 
obedience, it is in such matters as these. The value

of " Jack Raymond " consists almost wholly in its 
sympathetic study of the temperament of the youth 
who is the principal figure. 

A number of translations, more than usually in- 
teresting, call for mention before the close of this 
review. First of all, there are three books by the 
veteran Hungarian novelist. Dr. Maurus Jokai. 
"The Day of Wrath " is a story written more than 
half a century ago, when the pace of fiction was 
still set by the fashion of German romanticism and 
when the author, saddened by the failure of the 
Hungarian revolution of 1848, was disposed to take 
a gloomy view of life. It is essentially the story 
of a peasant uprising in rural Hungary, brought 
about as the natural consequence of a pestilence, 
when unscrupulous agitators played upon the super- 
stitions of a credulous folk. It is a lurid and ex- 
travagant tale, abounding in horrors and heroisms, 
and like most of the author's books, racy of the 
soil upon which the scene is laid. The translation 
is slovenly to a degree beyond excuse. 

Dr. Jokai's " Manasseh " is a novel of somewhat 
later date, with a more cosmopolitan cast, although 
the most striking chapters take us to Transylva- 
nia and among the " Szeklers," or frontiersmen, 
who long resisted the Austrian domination. The 
principal characters are Unitarians, which accounts 
for the real title of the book, " Egy az Isten," mean- 
ing " One is the Lord." It seems that there are 
something like seventy thousand Unitarians in 
Transylvania, the sect dating from a grant of re- 
ligious toleration in the sixteenth century. Histor- 
ically, the story takes us to the fifties, and the bat- 
tle of Solferino comes into one of the later chap- 
ters. We regret to note that the translator has 
seen fit, or been constrained, to abridge the narra- 
tive extensively, which we cannot believe is a justi- 
fiable thing to do. 

The third of Dr. Jokai's novels before us is one 
of his latest productions, having been translated 
from the manuscript under the author's supervision. 
It is entitled " Dr. Dumany's Wife," and is of the 
period culminating in the war between France and 
Prussia. A publisher's note tells us that the author 
was born in 1825, and is now sixty-six years of age 
— two statements difficult to reconcile. The first 
lines of the story itself tell of a traveller who took 
the St. Gothard road for Paris at a date preceding 
by several years the opening of that road for traf- 
fic. A little later in the book, when we are pre- 
sumably in the sixties, we meet with amateur pho- 
tographers (long before dry plates were invented), 
and come upon discussions of such things as the 
simian descent of man and the insidious doings of 
microbes. The author has frequently displayed his 
magnificent disregard of historical facts, but his 
anachronisms are not usually quite so evident as 
these. The story is essentially a modern one in 
both incident and feeling. It is picturesque, melo- 
dramatic, and full of the national spirit of Hungary. 
Like most of the author's works, its inventions are 
quite untrammelled by any considerations of prob- 



ability, and the cost is never counted when a bril- 
liant effect is to be reached. His work is always 
more suggestive of the "Arabian Nights" than of 
anything in modern fiction. 

In Hungary, we are told, the stories of Mr. Kal- 
man Mikszath are almost as popular as those of 
the more widely famous writer we have just been 
considering. Upon reading " St. Peter's Umbrella," 
the book with which this writer is now introduced 
to the English public, we can easily understand its 
success. It is a quaint, whimsical narrative of life 
in a Slovak village, with much folk-lore and local 
coloring, rich in a shrewd sort of philosophy, and 
brightened by flashes of the most unexpected yet 
unmistakable humor. The story itself is of the 
slightest, and there is little attempt at serious char- 
acterization, but upon the thread of his invention 
the author has strung such a succession of pretty 
pictures and witty remarks that the interest is not 
allowed to flag for a moment. We feel that a real 
treasure has been unearthed for as by the transla- 
tor of this delightful book. 

M. de Soissons, prefacing his translation of "An- 
ima Vilis" from the Polish of Miss Rodziewicz, 
declares it to be his purpose to supply a corrective 
for the false impressions of Siberia that many peo- 
ple get from melodramatic books about nihilists and 
from " cannibalistic newspaper articles." Here is a 
story that has nothing to do with dungeons and con- 
spirators, with the Third Section and administrative 
exile. It is a story of the real Siberians, of their 
struggle for a livelihood under difficult conditions, 
of the monotony of their lives, and of the ordinary 
human and domestic relations. There are no verv 
striking figures in the book, and the story, as such, 
is hardly worth considering. But truthfulness to 
life and sincerity of purpose are apparent in its 
every line, and the writer is one well deserving the 
acquaintance of the English-speaking public. 

In *' Sigurd Eckdal's Bride," the author, Herr 
Richard Voss, has evidently been inspired by the 
ill-fated Andree expedition. Sigurd Eckdal, with 
a single companion, starts to discover the North 
Pole in a balloon. The companion, who is the 
rejected lover of Sigurd's betrothed bride, returns 
alone after a year or more, and reports that Sigurd, 
confronted by failure, has thrown himself from the 
balloon. In fact, the companion has murdered 
him. After a while, he persuades the bereaved 
"bride" to marry him, but his conscience allows 
him no rest. Oppressed by the burden of his aw- 
ful secret, he makes a written confession of the 
crime, without, however, intending that any one 
shall read it. But death overtakes him unexpect- 
edly, in a great fire at Throndhjem, while he is 
heroically engaged in saving lives. Thus doubly 
a national hero, his fame seems secure, but his 
widow, discovering the fatal confession, feels it her 
duty to proclaim the truth to the world. The iron- 
ically tragic situation thus created is exceedingly 
powerful, and the writer has a firm grasp of its psy- 
chological capabilities. Incidentally, the book por-

trays with much impressiveness the dreariness of life 
in the north of Norway, and in this respect is strik- 
ingly like the Siberian novel previously mentioned. 

Signora Serao's "The Land of Cockayne" is a 
story of Naples, and of the evil effects of the 
National Lottery upon the characters of a people 
without self-control. Her canvas is a crowded one 
and includes all the types of Neapolitan society, 
from the humblest to the most aristocratic. The 
realism of the story is of the sort that accumulates 
all the minute details conceivable, and leaves the 
reader to select for himself those that are signifi- 
cant. But there is no denying the power of this 
gifted writer or the faithfulness of her depiction of 
the life that she knows so well. In its character as 
a tract, or a crusade, the book deserves to rank with 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." It has the same faults of 
vehemence and exaggeration, but it also stirs the 
conscience in the same way. The lottery evil may 
be a far less serious menace to the social welfare of 
the nation then is here assumed, and yet deserve 
the most energetic and impassioned measures for 
its suppression. Still, a book goes artistically wrong 
that shows us hundreds of people who make gam- 
bling the principal object of their lives, yet none of 
whom ever draw prizes. The odds strongly favor 
the government, no doubt, but there are still many 
chances to win ; otherwise the Neapolitan folk could 
not be presented to us as rational human creatures. 

Last upon our list of recent translations comes 
the " Labor " (Travail) of M. Zola. It is a far 
cry indeed from the Rougon-Macquart books, with 
their accumulation of repulsive details, to this 
lyrical exaltation of the dignity of toil, to this 
impassioned presentation of the noblest ideals of 
social justice and the solidarity of mankind. The 
author does not escape from his earlier methods, 
however, for he still gives us interminable technical 
descriptions and family histories. But his spirit 
is a new one, or rather it is a spirit not readily to 
be found in the books that first made him famous, 
although we suspect that it better represents the 
man behind the work than all the realistic elabo- 
rations of " L'Assommoir " and " La Terre." As 
a matter of fact, M. Zola is of the romantic school 
by instinct, and has now given up the attempt to 
suppress his true character. The essential purpose 
of " Labor " is to present the author's ideal of the 
sort of cooperative endeavor that he believes will 
prove the ultimate solution of the great social prob- 
lem. His socialistic community offers an enticing 
spectacle, and his belief in the perfectibility of hu- 
man nature is so whole-hearted that it proves con- 
tagious while we remain under the spell of his 
glowing pages. Afterwards, doubts creep into the 
mind, and we begin to realize the artificial charac- 
ter of the whole scheme. But the book is so fine 
in its conception, and so noble in its idealism, that it 
can hardly fail to quicken the most sluggish heart, 
and bring hope to the soul that is most despairing of 

social progress. „„

oi Singing. Her " len cjinging J^es- 

sons" (Harper), though they necessarily take ouly the 
form of a few bints, tell something of the method that 
has made her name famous. That a smooth and well- 
trained voice has more elementary beauty and is capa- 
ble of more intense and varied expression than any 
instrument, we are all aware; but few of us realize the 
natural attributes which proclaim the successful vocal- 
ist. The author names them totidem verbis : an attract- 
ive appearance, the gifts of the musician, quickness of 
conception, and the power of representation, together 
with requisites of relatively minor importance — a good 
ear, a sound and rich voice of extended compass, added 
to an ardent desire to become an artist, — such is the 
essential equipment of those that would travel the fair 
if thorny road that stretches out before them. Madame 
Marchesi, herself a pupil of the eminent master Manuel 
Garcia (who is living at nearly ninety years of age, in 
London), has been especially successful with exponents 
of the art of pure bel canto, the style of singing which 
calls for the nicest adjustment and balance of the vocal 
means. Her art is founded on truth and nature; as to 
the success of her theory of tone formation, we have 
but to recall Mmes. Etelka Gerster, Emma Eames, 
Emma Calv^, and Nellie Melba, all of whom owe so 
much to their teacher. As has been pointed out, she is 
something more than a great teacher of singing — she 
is at once the great enthusiast and philosopher of her 
art. Her present volume embraces an elaborate analy- 
sis of the connection of music with the human voice, as 
well as critical comment on its position with reference 
to individual ability, in such a manner as to enable one 
to discriminate and determine a voice that has no po- 
tentialities of successful training. The volume contains 
intimate recollections of persons famous on the concert 
and lyric stage, and includes a brief review of the mu- 
sical conditions prevailing in Paris. No more noble 
tribute can be paid to the ability of Mathilde Marchesi 
than to quote the words of Mme. Melba: "When in the 
fulness of time this mistress of her art elects to retire 
from the position she has so long adorned, and to seek 
rest from the labors of her long and illustrious life, she 
will do more than lay down her burden of toil — she 
will lay down a Sceptre."

the general reader rather than the specialist, and for 
that reason the details of such things as Scott's en- 
tanglement in the failure of the Ballantynes are given 
only so far as they are necessary to our understanding 
of the story. The experiences out of which Scott's 
writings were to grow are carefully traced from boy- 
hood, and in " The Lady of the Lake " and " Guy Man- 
nering" we find again the spirit of spectacular and 
picturesque romance that had kindled his early imag- 
ination. The pathos of Scott's ambition to maintain a

sented, and so also is his final manliness and heroism in 
meeting the overwhelming obligations involved in the

failure of the publishing house in which he was inter- 
ested. Graphically told, too, is the story of his infatu- 
ation with royalty in the person of George IV., by whom 
he was created a baronet. In some quarters, Scott has 
been greatly over-rated ; but in the two concluding 
chapters of criticism in this book there is full recog- 
nition of the faulty construction of his novels, of the 
diiSuseness and slovenliness of his style, of the lac]^ of 
verbal felicities, and the absence of any inspiration be- 
yond the commonplace in his poetry. Yet, as Professor 
Hudson says in conclusion, " Obsolete, it is certain 
Scott will never become till men have ceased to under- 
stand in literature the difference between the real and 
the factitious, the true and the false." 

Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones's second vol- 
Bioqu^ biu Of yj^g of .. 3itg j,{ Wayside Gospel " has 

(Macmillan). It is a series of chapters no less inter- 
esting than its predecessor " Jess," and no less full of 
striking instances of Mr. Jones's power to find " ser- 
mons in stones," and ringing words for high thoughts. 
No fact or situation is too familiar or too commonplace 
to be untranslatable by him into terms both of poetry 
and of religion. For example, take this passage a propos 
of standing by the bank of a city river: "The river 
gathers up the filth and garbage of the city until it 
becomes fetid and loathsome, but a dozen miles be- 
yond it is again clear and pure. Filth is always foreign 
substance, and Nature is never at a loss to know what 
to do with it. She filters it through gravel beds, strains 
it through cloud sieves, plants her rivers with water- 
cresses and lilies, and peoples her deeps with a thousand 
forms of animal life, revelling in a beauty of their own, 
and all for the purpose of purifying her waters. . . . 
Life, like water, may hold in solution a thousand sub- 
stances; but through all its restless motion, it is per- 
manent and changeless. Rocks crumble into sand, 
mountains are carried into the valleys, but the sea re- 
mains. So forms, dogmas, and institutions may change, 
but the sea of life ever rolls in great tides toward the 
heavenly attractions." These pregnant and stimulating 
discourses are well worthy of the permanent preserva- 
tion and handsome dress given them by the publishers. 

In the " Highways and Bvwavs of

of mutie themes. ,, \ r ■ , , i Vk tt i 

a collection of six lectures by Dr. riugh 

A. Clarke, of the University of Pennsylvania. With a 
vigor and originality that charm always and convince 
very often. Dr. Clarke discusses sundry up-to-date mu- 
sical practices and theories. In discussing "Art Music," 
he denies that this is essentially, although sometimes it 
may be, an outg^wth of the folk-song, the folk-song 
having as little to do with the noble melody of Mozart 
or Beethoven as the pretty prattle of an intelligent child 
with the weighty sayings of the same child when grown 
into a world-wise poet. The great German composers 
having shown how themes must be treated to produce 
great works of art, all great works must conform to 
these conditions until some better form is discovered. 
A folk-song can do no more than give a sort of quasi- 
local color to a composition; consequently it is vain to 
look for an American school of music to grow out of 
" plantation melodies. " Dvorak's " American Sym- 
phony " is in no sense a development from indigenous 
American music. It is a symphony constructed in ac- 
cord with the well-known plan that owes its existence 
to the Teutonic element in music. The only result at- 



tained by the choice he has made of its themes is that 
it sounds like the apotheosis of the " minstrel show." 
In discussing "Modern Tendencies in Music" Dr. Clarke 
finds a trend toward harmonic freedom and toward 
formlessness, and away from melody and " tune." To 
give up melody for recitative, and form for vagueness, 
seems akin to atavism rather than prog^ssive evolu- 
tion; but Dr. Clarke finds gains to offset the losses. 
Despite the extravagences into which some composers 
have fallen, the emancipation of harmony is a great 
step forward, and it is quite possible that from the pres- 
ent formlessness some new and more beautiful forms 
may be evolved. Also, there is hope in the cultivation 
of the best class of music in which there is now a wide- 
spread and ever-growing interest. Whereas, in our 
country, music formerly was a luxury within the reach 
of the wealthy and cultivated classes exclusively, its 
most interested patrons at the present time are found 
among the people at large. By the formation of choral 
and other musical organizations, and in very great de- 
gree by the generous liberality of men of means and 
public spirit, it is now possible for everyone to hear the 
greatest of instrumental compositions — performed by 
orchestras of unsurpassable excellence. Only a master- 
mind can treat large subjects in the brief yet scholarly 
fashion of this little book, in which both the amateur 
and the professional will find matter well worth his 
while. 

AteanshMtke "Th® Philosophy of History," by Mr. 
law^kuwttm S. S. Hebberd, is a carefully-wrought 

developmenL essay, in which the attempt is made to 

establish a single law of thought which will successfully 
explain the course of human development. The author 
finds this fundamental law in the statement that " causes 
can be known only through their effects; and, con- 
versely, effects can be known only through their causes." 
Taking this fundamental law as a key, the author ap- 
plies it in turn to the doors of human history, and 
makes it open them all in succession, from the contem- 
plative systems of Indian thought to the industrial con- 
flicts of the nineteenth century. The book cannot be 
even summarized here; but it may be said that its 
treatment of old problems is fresh, logical, and in many 
respects convincing. Especially is this true of the chap- 
ters on classical and mediaeval art, in which the law of 
" unity in dependence " is admirably illustrated. How 
the book will be received by the followers of the great 
school of philosophy which it antagonizes, is not certain ; 
but it is likely to command their interest. Mr. Heb- 
berd's close adherence to his thesis occasionally betrays 
him into some extravagances, as when (p. 305) he 
makes the newspapers and churches, and in large degree 
the colleges and universities, subservient to the conjoint 
rule of the bosses and the monopolists. But in general 
his thought is temperately and lucidly expressed, and 
appeals both to reason and right feeling. Mr. Hebbard 
is his own publisher, at La Crosse, Wisconsin.

atmosphere in which the soul prospers or droops or 
faints." Hence the value of having at hand a book like 
this, vital with so much fine wisdom of experience, in- 
spiring through its faith in the worth and sacredness of 
human life, in the joy of living, in civilization and pro- 
gress, in God and the soul. The lovers — and they are 
many — of Bishop Spalding's earlier books will rejoice 
in this precious addition to the series. 

With the greatest admiration and even 
enthusiasm for his subject, Mr. Frank 
B. Sanborn's volume on Emerson, in the 
series of " Beacon Biographies " (Small, Maynard & 
Co.) is not what we should expect from one who knew 
Emerson so well. There is a lack of color and definite- 
ness in the picture which is hard to explain, but which 
all Emerson lovers will feel. Perhaps Mr. Sanborn has 
been oppressed by the weight of hifi material, for he 
knew Emerson long and intimately, and, moreover, he 
feels that previous biographers have failed to grasp the 
principal spring of Emerson's character. This trait 
he conceives to be versatility, and the presence of his 
subtle and sincere thought in every pathway of the hu- 
man intellect. But that Mr. Sanborn has been success- 
.ful in presenting this aspect of his subject will not be 
granted. The principal value of the book to many 
readers will be its chronology of Emerson's life. Even 
the bibliography of a dozen volumes fails to mention 
some of the best sources for Emerson research.

three narratives in which the life-stories of Josephine,

BRIEFER MENTION. 



For the many who are unable to view the annual 
exhibitions of the Royal Academy a large measure of 
consolation is offered in the volumes of " Royal Acad- 
emy Pictures," issued for several years past by Messrs. 
Cassell & Co., Ltd. In comprehensiveness and author- 
ity, as well as in the artistic quality of its reproductions, 
this work holds a foremost place among publications of 
its kind. The issue for 1901, just published, is made 
doubly attractive by the inclusion of five full-page 
photogravures, instead of but one as heretofore. With 
Mr. Spielmann's Preface, and the numerous notes, this 
latest volume of "Royal Academy Pictures" forms as 
satisfactory a black-and-white reproduction of the late 
exhibition at Burlington House as could be desired. 

When people began to take sides for and against the 
King and Parliament in the rising tide of the American 
Revolution, much alarm was felt by the patriots because 
the Loyalists, as the pro-British were called, were so 



strong and influential in the city and colony of New 
York. This was due largely to the predominance then 
of mercantile interests, which were unwilling to see 
trade interfered with for the sake of political principles. 
At the close of the war the feeling against these Loyal- 
ists found vent in the treatment which is usually ac- 
corded the vanquished by the victors in warfare. A 
thorough study of this phase of the Revolution has been 
made by Mr. A. C. Flick in his " Loyalism in New 
York during the American Revolution " (Columbia 
University Press). The author has wisely compiled a 
systematic presentation of the facts concerning the 
origin of the Loyalists, their activity against the patriots, 
and their subsequent hardships, rather than a justifica- 
tion or condemnation of their attitude toward their 
country. 

Mr. Charles Alfred Downer's " Frdd^ric Mistral, 
Poet and Leader in Provence " (Macmillan) is a careful 
critical study of "Mirfeio" and its fellow-poems, and an 
account of the author's life based upon careful research 
as well as personal acquaintance. Furthermore, it is a 
history of the Felibrige movement and a treatise upon 
the Provencal language. The work belongs to the 
series of literary studies that have been prepared by 
recent candidates for the doctorate of Columbia Uni- 
versity, and illustrates a sort of original work far better 
worth doing than the counting and cataloguing that too 
frequently do duty for a doctor's thesis. 

In a bulky monograph entitled " Political Nativism 
in New York State " (Columbia University Press) 
Mr. Louis Dow Scisco traces the history of the anti- 
foreigner movement from the first riot against the 
Catholics in New York City in 1806. He finds the 
feeling against aliens especially strong in that city and 
state, both because this region was the first destination 
of immigrants, and also because it had been peopled 
previously by Englishmen — the hereditary foe of the 
Irish, who predominated among the new comers. The 
effect of this social question on national politics between 
1835 and 1860 occupies the largest part of the author's 
attention. The movement is summed up by him as 
peculiarly un-American and narrowing in its aim, al- 
though a prominent factor in rounding out the ideal of 
the nation. The latter paradox is satisfactorily ex- 
plained by showing that it led to more homogeneity in 
religion and in social life, and thus became ultimately 
a benefit, although outwardly a failure. 

For all to whom the humor of Eugene Field's 
" Tribune Primer " makes its appeal no better edition 
could be found than that lately issued by the Mutual 
Book Co. of Boston. The broad caricature of Mr. F. 
Opper's seventy-five drawings is well adapted to the 
work in hand, and the volume has the further advant- 
age of including, in addition to the " Primer," a number 
of Field's earlier miscellaneous writings, such as the 
" Auto- Analysis " and "The Two Friars." 

Maryland, a Border State, which did not secede 
from the Union in 1861, was exempt from the Emanci- 
pation Proclamation of President Lincoln, which pri- 
marily destroyed slavery in so many of the States. 
How the anti-slavery element in that state succeeded in 
freeing her from the system is told by Mr. William 
Starr Myers in a monograph on " The Maryland Con- 
stitution of 1864 " (Johns Hopkins Press). The author 
thinks that the Civil War simply hastened an action 
bound to come eventually from economic and senti- 
mental causes.

" Julius Csesar," edited by Mr. Cyrus L. Hooper, is 
the first volume of a school Shakespeare to be published 
by Messrs. Ainsworth & Co. 

A new volume of verse by the Right Reverend J. L. 
Spalding, Bishop of Peoria, will be issued at once by 
The Grafton Press of New York. 

An entirely new and revised " Twentieth Century " 
edition of Messrs. Isaac Pitman & Sons' " Complete 
Shorthand Instructor " is announced for early issue. 

Messrs. Eaton & Mains publish a new and revised 
edition of Professor Richard T. Ely's well-known 
" Introduction to Political Economy," which first ap- 
peared twelve years ago. 

"The Story of King Alfred," by the late Walter 
Besant, is a new volume in the Messrs. Appletons' 
" Library of Useful Stories." It is both a timely and 
an interesting publication. 

Two of the most recent dramatizations of popular 
novels are those of Mr. Opie Read's "Old Ebenezer" 
and Mr. Charles Clark Munn's " Uncle Terry." Both 
plays will have their initial presentation this Fall. 

A series of " Little Biographies " will be inaugurated 
this Fall by Messrs. Knight & Millet of Boston, the 
first two volumes being devoted to "Dante," by Mr. 
Paget Toynbee, and "Savonarola," by Mr. E. L. S. 
Horsburg. 

Dryden, Gray, Goldsmith, Bums, and Coleridge, are 
illustrated by one or two pieces each in Miss Mary E. 
Litchfield's " Selections from Five English Poets." 
This is an annotated school book published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. 

"Arline Val^re," by Mr. Joseph Hall worth, is a 
novel published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. It is a 
novelty in bookmaking, being a facsimile reproduction 
of the author's manuscript, adorned with quaint mar- 
ginal illustrations. 

A historical romance having to do with the little- 
known career of Charlotte de Bourbon, wife of William 
of Orange, will be published this month by the Griffith 
& Rowland Press of Philadelphia. The author is Mrs. 
Caroline Atwater Mason. 

" The Great Mother of the Gods," published by the 
University of Wisconsin, is a doctoral dissertation by 
Mr, Grant Showermau. A feature unusual in works of 
this description is provided by a series of illustrations, 
both artistic and archaeological in their interest. 

The sixth annual report of the John Crerar Library, 
covering the year 1900, has just been issued. Its most 
noteworthy feature is the portrait and memorial sketch 
of the late Huntington W. Jackson, who was one of the 
original trustees named in the will of the founder. 

What is probably the first English translation of Bal- 
zac's dramatic works will be published this month by 
Messrs. Laird & Lee. These plays, five in number, 
were written during the best period of the author's lit- 
erary career, and have all beeu produced upon promi- 
nent Parisian stages. The translator's name is not g^ven. 

The American Economic Association has completed 
the first volume of the new (third) series of its publi- 
cations. The volume for 1900, now at hand, inclndes 
four numbers, the last of which is a monograph on " Cur- 
rency and Banking in the Province of the Massachu- 
setts Bay," by Mr. Andrew McFarland Davis. Although 
this work comprises nearly five hundred pages, it covers 



only the " currency " half of its subject, and the sec-ond, 
or " banking " half, will receive treatment in a later 
publication, to be included in the 1901 volume of the 
Association. The Macmillan Co. are the publishers of 
these books. 

Mr. Frank M. Morris of Chicago annonnces a limited 
reprint of the " Basia of Johannes Secundus Nicolaius," 
including also the " Ephthalaminm," in the original 
translation of George Ogle, first published in 1771. 
Mr. Ralph Fletcher Seymour has designed the decora- 
tions for the volume, and an introductory memoir is 
supplied by Mr. Wallace Rice. 

A second impression of Mr. William Vaughn Moody's 
Poems, published a few weeks since, is announced by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Lovers of genuine 
poetry will be glad to learn that there is such a demand 
for Mr. Moody's book, for by general consent of the 
critics no volume of American verse has appeared for 
many a day so strong in the higher qualities of poetry. 

Dr. Horace Howard Furness's life-work, the prepara- 
tion of the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare's plays, 
has now been advanced to the thirteenth volume, which 
J. B. Lippincott Company will issue this autumn. The 
new volume will contain " Twelfth Night," and will be 
supplied with the voluminous notes, various readings, 
discussion of the plot and composition, and bibliog^phy 
and index which characterized the other volumes. 

" Blossom Hosts and Insect Guests," by the late 
William Hamilton Gibson, is a publication of Messrs. 
Newson & Co. It is a compilation, made from peri- 
odical and other sources by Miss Eleanor E. Davie, of 
all that Gibson ever wrote on the subject of the fertili- 
zation of flowers. Other volumes of bird and insect 
studies are now in preparation, forming a series mainly 
educational in purpose, yet interesting to the general 
reader. 

The series of " British Anthologies " compiled by 
Prof. Edward Arber, and published by the Oxford 
University Press, is now completed by the appearance 
of the first and last volumes of the set, — the " Dunbar 
Anthology" and the "Cowper Anthology." The ten 
volumes of this admirable work cover a period of four 
centuries, from 1401 to 1800, and include no less than 
1935 selections. A complete index to first lines is con- 
tained in the final volume. 

The combination of all forms of insurance in one 
group is advocated by Mr. Allan H. Willett in " The 
Economic Theory of Risk and Insurance " (Columbia 
University Press) . The individual producer would then 
no longer feel reluctant to enter an industry on account 
of the risk. There would result a perfect static adjust- 
ment of capital which insures its greatest productivity, 
and the negative loss caused by unequal degrees of 
risk would disappear. 

The collotype facsimile of the Shakespeare First 
Folio of 1623, which the Clarendon Press has in prepa- 
ration, is being reproduced from the Chats worth copy, 
owned by the Duke of Devonshire. The reproduction 
will be the exact size of the original, with the necessary 
margin; and the whole of the 910 pages of the First 
Folio wUl be included in one volume. A brief Intro- 
duction by Mr. Sidney Lee will be prefixed, giving 
bibliographical details, with as full a catalogue as prac- 
ticable of all known copies of the First Folio. The 
edition will be strictly limited and sold by subscription. 
It is not likely that the work will be completed before 
the end of next year.

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and " Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass ot historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

WORLD OF THE THOUGHTFUL." 

FOMA QORDYEEFF 

A powerfully realistic novel, by MAXIM GORKY, the literary Hon 
of the day in his native Russia and throughout Continental 
Europe, and now, through his most forceful novel, introduced 
to the American public by his authorized publishers for America. 

" But even aside from its moral aspect the work is a remarkable piece of 
literature. It was fittingly chosen for Gorky's debut. " — Philadelphia Record. 

Herman Rosenthal, Librarian of the Russian Department, 
New York Public Library, describes Gorky as ^'' the future master 
destined to create a new epoch."

Amateur Cracksman," etc. With illustra- 
tions by P. C. YOHN. 

A new series of adventures of the clever 
and amusing rascal who made hosts of friends 
in the "Amatenr Cracksman." His further 
exploits illustrate the extraordinary range of 
the author's inventive faculty, as well as his 
ingenuity in extricating his hero and his com- 
panion, Bunny, from the dangers into which 
their gentlemanly rascality carries them. The 
book contains adventures that have never been 
published serially, bringing to a definite and 
heroic conclxision the career of a character alto- 
gether unique in literature. $1 .50.

Dreams," "My Friends and I," etc. 

A brilliant novel of England and Constanti- 
nople during the Russo-Turkish war by a gifted 
story-teller. It involves an absorbing study 
of the conflict of natures in a character half 
Oriental half English. The action is rapid and

delicate and vigorous, and the denouement 
logical and satisfying. $ 1 .50.

Cnrtin's unerring sense of what is the most interesting in contem- 
porary Polish literature, is a novelist whose earlier stories had 
already given her some vogue at home, when her "Argonauts"

novel of power and melodramatic intensity on the old but inexhaust- 
ible theme of the essential powerlessness of human power. $1.50.

mont , " " The History of the Lady Betty Stair, " etc . With many

THE TEMPTING OF FATHER ANTHONY 

By George Horton, author of " Like Another Helen," etc. With six full-page illustrations, 

and a striking cover design. 1 2mo, pp. 246, $1.25. 

Mr. Horton has again happily chosen modern Greece for the background of a story. During his long resi- 
dence there as American consul, he made a close study of life and conditions in the smaller villages, and he has 
utilized his knowledge by introducing into his latest book scenes and episodes that will be of new and unusual 
interest to the reading public. Father Anthony, the son of a village priest, aspires to follow in the footsteps of 
St. Anthony by giving up the joys of the world and leading an ascetic's life. The way in which the attractions of 
a village maiden cause him to abandon his ambition is told with much humor and charm.

WORD AND PHRASE 

True and False Use in English. By Joseph Fitz- 
gerald, izmo, S^r. 2^ net. 

A most novel and unusual book on the use, misuse, 
and derivation of the English language. The author's 
wide and searching scholarship has enabled him to im- 
part valuable instruction in such an easy and agreeable 
style that it will be welcome to anyone who cares to 
improve the use of his English, either in writing or 
speaking.

Some Verses Gay and Grave. By R. C. Rose. i6mo,

touch and happy fancy. The author is a young Chi- 
cago newspaper man, the third in three generations of 
poets. The poems in this book figured for a number 
of years in a popular department of a daily paper, and 
have been revised and edited for this edition. They 
deal with a broad range of subjects, and are frequently 
relieved by humor and satire. 



RECENT SUCCESSFUL FICTION

Miss Potter's greatest success has been made in this 
story of the reign of King John. The leading charac- 
ter, Anthony Fitz-Hubert, is a brilliant young courtier, 
son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who turns monk 
to insure the safety of his father's soul. The book is 
especially significant for its interpretation of King John' s 
character and acts, which differs widely from the tradi- 
tional view. 

The Chevalier de St. Denis 

By Alice Ilgenfritz Jones, izmo, $1.23. 
The love of the Chevalier for the fair Senorita de 
Villescas is the thread of continuous interest in the story, 
which moves at a swift pace through the splendors of 
Louis XIV.'s court, the fighting in the War of the 
Spanish succession, and adventures amid the forests of 
Louisiana. 



By Katharine Tynan, author of "The Handsome 

Brandons," "The Dear Irish Girl," etc. izmo, 

$1.30.

upon relieving her. 

"This novel abounds in delightful pen pictures of country life in 
Ireland, which are admirable in their idyllic charm as well as in 
their truthful rendering of actual conditions. " — Chicago Inter Ocean. 

Heirs of Yesterday 

By Emma Wolf, izmo, $1.00. 

A brilliant and interesting story of social life in San 
Francisco, dealing principally with the higher type of 
Jewish-Americans. 

" The author knows her people well, and has drawn all the figures 
of her story with a firm hand. Her book will win its way to the re- 
gard of many readers."— TAe Argonaut, San Francisco. 

" Miss Wolf's book is really the first American Jewish novel that 
can take its place with the work of Howells in New England, Cable in 
Louisiana, and Garland in the West." — American Hebreic, New York

A NEW EDITION OF 

HENRIK IBSEN 

1828-1888. A Critical Biography. By Henrik Jaeger. Translated by William Morton 
Payne. With an additional chapter by Mr. Payne covering the period from 1888 to 1898. 
Also a photogravure frontispiece from a rare portrait of Ibsen. i2mo, pp. 315, $1.50. 
When Henrik Ibsen celebrated his sixtieth birthday in 1888, his friend, Henrik Jaeger, wrote the critical 
biography which, in Mr. William Morton Payne's English translation, was published eleven years ago. Mr. 
Payne was probably the first American reader, not Scandinavian by descent, to become acquainted with Ibsen's 
work, and he has borne in this country the same pioneer relation to Ibsen criticism that Mr. Edmund Gosse has 
borne in England, and is unquestionably the most competent Ibsen critic in America. The work has for some 
time been out of print, owing to the destruction of the remaining copies in the fire of February, 1899. Since it 
is the standard English work upon its subject, a new edition has been greatly needed, and this the publishers are 
now about to supply. Mr. Payne has written for the new edition a supplementary chapter which gives an analy- 
sis of the six plays that Ibsen has produced since Jaeger's book was written. This makes the book a complete 
account — the only one existing in English — of the life and writings of the great Norwegian whose career is now 
unhappily drawing to a close.

A History of the American People 

By Francis Newton Thorpe, Ph.D., author of "A 

Constitutional History of the American People," etc. 

With maps and index, izmo, pp. 627, ^/.jo net. 

A one-volume history of our country, comprehensive, 
scholarly, readable, and exact. 

"An American history that should devote more space to the arts 
of peace than to the wiles of politics and the thunders of war has 
long been needed. Francis Newton Thorpe has filled the want with 
his 'History of the American People.' The book is more readable 
than historical romance — it is the romance of history. ... A full, 
well-rounded statement of the conditions of existence in this country 
from the earliest to the latest recorded times."

Aphorisms and Reflections 

By Rt. Rev. J. L. Spalding, Bishop of Peoria, author 
of "Opportunity," "Means and Ends of Educa- 
tion," etc. i2mo, 80 cts. net. 
In his new book. Bishop Spalding has collected — 
in the form of short paragraphs — many of his finest 
theories regarding conduct, culture, and religion. They 
are written with the simplicity and directness that indi- 
cates sincerity of thought, and a clear, unbiased point 
of view. The subjects discussed cover such a broad 
field that every reader is likely to find many suggestions 
which may be given a personal application. * 

A General \Survey of 'American 
- 'Literature] 

By Mary Fisher. i2mo, 382 pages, and Index, 

" Miss Fisher says that her book ' has grown largely out of her 
work ' in the clasa-room. Rarely has a book so admirably adapted 
to class-room study been made so notably interesting to the general 
reader. The volume contains terse, clear, honest studies of those 
men and women who have done most to raise the standard of literary 
work in the United States." — Inter Ocean, Chicago. 

McLaughlin and Old Oregon 

A Chronicle. By Eva Emery Dye. i2mo, 381 

pages, St. so. 

"It depicts Oregon in the periods immediately preceding and 
following that eventful entry of American missionaries among its 
Indian tribes, in 1836, which soon secured the northwestern territory 
on the Pacific to the United Stotes. The hero. Dr. John McLoughlin, 
the 'White-Headed B^le,' as the Indians called him, was no less 
efficient a factor in securing the American occupation than the 
missiouaries themselves." — The Outlook.

Selections from the September List of 

Houghton, Mifflin & Company 



THE TORY LOVER 

By Sarah Orne Jewett, author of " The Country of the Pointed Firs," " The Queen's Twin," 
etc. Illustrated by Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Woodbury. 1 vol., crown 8vo, $1.50. 
[^September 21.'\ 

This is the longest and the strongest book that Miss Jewett has yet written. It is a story of the Revolution, 
and the stirring scenes and powerful passions of the time give it a highly dramatic character. The spirit of the 
epoch is finely reproduced, and the Tory lover, Roger Wallingford, who became a Patriot for love of Mary Ham- 
ilton, is a noble character, while Mary Hamilton herself is one of the most attractive heroines in modern fiction. 

OUR LADY VANITY 

By Ellen Olney Kirk, author of " The Story of Margaret Kent," etc. 12mo, $L50. 
«' We are all puppets of our Lady Vanity, who pulls the strings and leads us many a dance," says Mrs. Kirk 
in her new novel, which is even fuller of movement and interest than any of her other books. The " puppets " of 
the story are right interesting characters ; the self-made man, and the achievement of two ambitions in his son's 
marriage, lend decided interest to a story which is marked by Mrs. Kirk's kindly satire, genial philosophy, and 
wise humor.

Talks on Writing English 

Second Series. By Arlo Bates, Professor of English 

in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Crown 

8vo, $1.30 net; postpaid, $1.45. 

Professor Bates's First Series of Talks on Writing 

English has been highly successful. This series is of 

equal value. The opening talk is on " what, besides 

pen, paper, and ink, is needed for Composition." Other 

talks treat Little Foxes, the faults which spoil writing ; 

and Composition and Revision. The book is rich in 

the wisdom and experience of a teacher and author.

Announcement of Publication 



THE 

Voyage of Ithobal 

By Sir EDWIN ARNOLD 

Its subject is the circumnavigation of Africa by the Phoenicians six hundred years 
before Christ. 

Ithobal is a sea-captain of Tyre, who takes service with Neku, King of Egypt, to 
explore the unknown waters beyond the Red Sea. After picturesque scenes at Tyre, 
where he buys in the slave market, with a priceless pearl, an African princess, made 
captive in the Dark Continent, and alone knowing its secrets, he builds three ships at 
Suez and sets forth. 

All this is minutely described, together with full details of the voyage of fifteen 
thousand miles round Africa. Returning, with two out of three ships, after numerous 
and exciting adventures, which bring out almost every feature of African life and scenery, 
Ithobal relates the story of his enterprise, in a discourse of seven days, before the throne 
of Pharaoh, who loads with honors the successful captain, the Princess (his wife), and 
his crews. 

It is the opinion of able critics who have read the work that the poet has never done 
anything better than this prophetic and imaginative production, which is at once forceful 
and original, but most faithful to fact, reality, and geography. 



SIR HENRY M. STANLEY, in a leUer to the author, says of it : 

" You have added greatly to the happiness of many of your race, in 
every continent, by the production of so unique a poem, so rich in tJie 
beauties of the sweet English langvuge."

A New Novel hy the Author of*''' Ralph Marlowe,'^ 

DR. JAMES BALL NAYLOR 

A charming historical novel of the War of 1812, 
of the times of Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, The 
Prophet. At the instigation of the English, 
Tecumseh attempted to form a confederacy among 
the western tribes, which was defeated by the hasty 
action of his brother. The Prophet, during the 
absence of the former, resulting disastrously for the 
Shawnee Indians in the famous Battle of Tippe- 
canoe. Romance is happily blended with the his- 
torical, and pathos is supplied through the trials and 
unhappy fate of the early heroine of the book, while 
the beautiful ward of The Prophet, the real heroine 
of the story, will keep the reader in keen expectancy 
until the closing chapter. The book also has a counter- 
part of the talkative Jep Tucker, the yarn-spinner 
of "Ralph Marlowe," in the veteran hunter, Joe 
Farley, with his quaint provincialisms and drollery.

NEWEST BOOKS OF INTEREST 



Marcus Whitman and the Early Days of 
Oregon 

By William A. Mowrt, Ph.D. 358 pp. Illustrated. 
Cloth. 81.50. 

A book at once a history, biography, and an argument, throwing 
new light upon the history of the Pacific Coast. 

"The book is a valuable addition to the literature of the century. 
Its author has ably and conscientiously rendered a service to future 
historians by gathering the records for their possible use ; he has vin- 
dicated the claim to an honored memory of a figure which we should 
be loath to class among the indefensible myths of the past. He is not 
an iconoclastic enthusiast, but a sober-minded investigator. He pre- 
sents the case for his client moderately, appealing to facts and reasou 
alone; therefore he is convincing." — RIchaed Hbnbt Stoddakd in 
The Mail and Express, New York. 

International Law

Professor of Social and Political Science, Brown Univer- 
sity, and George Fox Tucker, Ph.D., lately Reporter

By WiLLiSTON Walker, Ph.D., D.D., Hartford Theological 
Seminary. 480 pp. Cloth, uncut edges, gilt top. $2.00. 

Biographical sketches of ten men representative of Congregational 
New England. 

" The style is admirable, clear, and unimpassioned, yet sympa- 
thetic. Beginning with the events which led up to the Pilgrim 
exodus, the series brings us down>o our own day ; for many readers of 
the volume have seen the last mentioned of its great men. Dr. Leonard 
Bacon, in the pulpit or upon the platform. In this day when so much 
has been written flippantly about the fathers of American society, 
church, and State, it is most pleasant to find a defender coming forward 
who speaks with the authority of a specialist, the gravity of a histo- 
rian, and the gratitude of one who realizes that the twentieth century 
inherits full as much as it ever can convey." — The Nation. 

The Religious Use of Imagination 

By Elias H. Johnson. Professor in Crozer Theological 
Seminary, Chester, Pa. 236 pp. Cloth, gilt top, $1.00. 
A fresh and awakening discussion of that ever present factor in life 
— the imagination. Its use as a guide to truth ^nd duty, and its 
invaluable service in portraying ideals, in arousing energy, and in 
enlisting perseverance, are some of the points made by the author.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... 191 
(A classified list of 1,800 titles announced for pabli- 
eation during the coming season. ) 



BOOKS OF T HE C OMING YEAR. 

The task of indicating, among the contents 
of a list of books that numbers not far from 
two thousand titles, the really important and 
significant announcements, is one that cannot 
be performed with any degree of thoroughness. 
We have taken a cursory and impressionistic 
survey of this vast field of prospective publica- 
tion, and noted a few things that seem par- 
ticularly deserving of prominent mention, but 
we have doubtless passed over two or three 
times as many more that will prove equally 
valuable additions to our libraries. The inad- 
equacy of this brief summary grows more ap- 
parent with every year, as the activities of 
anthors and publishers become multiplied, and 
as our classified catalogue of Fall announce- 
ments fills with every year an increasing num- 
ber of our pages. 

For American readers at least, we should 
say that the long-awaited biography of James 
Russell Lowell is likely to prove ** the book of 
the year." Intrusted to the competent hands of 
his intimate associate and friend, Mr. Horace 
E. Scudder, this biography has been prepared 
with leisurely industry, and the author has had 
access to practically all of the available bio- 
graphical material. We have no doubt that 
Mr. Scudder has risen to the occasion, and 
produced at the same time the most important 
of his own works and one of the most important 
works of biography in American literature. 
Our English friends, perhaps, will take a less 
exalted view of Lowell and his books than our 
own ; to them the leading biography of the 
year is likely to be found in Mr. Graham Bal- 
four's life of Robert Louis Stevenson, or, if 
not in that, in Mr. Le&lie Stephen's ** Life and 
Letters of John Richard Green." The three 
books together will certainly make this season 
memorable for biographical writing, even if we 
take no account of such other works as " The 
Making of an American," by Mr. Jacob A. 
Riis, the " Reminiscences " of Mr. George S. 
Boutwell, Bishop Creigh ton's life of Lord 
Grey, the two- volume life of Pasteur by R. 
Vallery-Radot, Mr. David Masson's biography 
of Chatterton, Miss H. Augusta Dodge's " Gail 



174 



THE DIAL. 



[Sept. 16, 



Hamilton's Life in Letters," Mr. Norman 
Hapgood's life of George Washington, Miss 
Mary S. Austin's "Philip Freneau, the Poet 
of the Revolution," and others too numerous 
to mention. 

In the department of historical writing, we 
find no books of such striking prominence as 
the three biographies above mentioned, but we 
find many attractive titles, such, for example, 
as the Right Hon. James Bryce's " Studies in 
History and Jurisprudence "; Mr. Andrew 
Lang's "The Mystery of Mary Stuart"; a 
three-volume history of "The American Fur 
Trade of the Far West," by Capt. Hiram M. 
Chittenden ; " The Civil War," by Professor 
John W. Burgess ; " George Washington, and 
Other American Addresses," by Mr. Frederic 
Harrison ; the concluding volume of " A His- 
tory of Scotland," by Mr. Andrew Lang ; 
" Historic Towns of the Western States," 
edited by Mr. Lyman P. Powell ; and many 
new volumes in the standard series. 

One of the most noticeable features of this 
year's list is found in the extraordinary num- 
ber and variety of reprints of the best literature 
of the past. In spite of the seeming craze for 
new books, and the unprecedented sales of the 
popular fiction of the day, the evidence grows 
stronger every year that bookbuyers are turn- 
ing more and more in the direction of good 
standard literature, and are creating a demand 
for reprints that makes this field of bookmaking 
one of the safest as well as one of the most 
profitable in which the publisher of taste and 
discernment can work. Here are a few titles 
that fill us with pleasurable anticipations: 
" Colonial Prose and Poetry," in three volumes, 
edited by Messrs. W. P. Trent and B. W. 
Wells ; a " Temple " Balzac, in forty volumes ; 
a "Temple" Bronte, in twelve volumes ; Lane's 
" Arabian Nights," in six volumes ; an edition 
of Samuel Richardson, in twenty volumes ; a 
" Temple " Bible, in twenty-four volumes; a 
new edition of Mr. Forman's Keats, in five 
volumes ; a new Dickens, in twenty-nine vol- 
umes ; a new Carlyle, in twenty-six volumes ; 
and several new editions each of Scott, Shake- 
speare, and Dumas. After all, these are the 
books that one places upon the shelves of his 
library with the greatest satisfaction. 

A few miscellaneous announcements, which 
we cannot refrain from mentioning, may be 
brought together in a paragraph. " More Let- 
ters of Edward FitzGerald " will delight thou- 
sands of refined readers. Mr. W. C. Brownell 
will have a volume of essays on " Victorian 



Prose Masters." Professor Miinsterberg's 
" American Traits " will provide us with good 
reading and wholesome instruction. Mr. How- 
ells will be sure to discourse charmingly of the 
" Heroines of Fiction." Lovers of T. E. 
Brown's poems and letters will be glad to add 
his " Essays " to their collection. " Societol- 
ogy," by Professor W. G. Sumner, will deal 
soberly with themes that occasion much irre- 
sponsible vaporing. The first volume of Pro- 
fessor J. M. Baldwin's great " Dictionary of 
Philosophy and Psychology " will take its place 
among the standard works of reference. The 
"Modern Scandinavian Literature" of Dr. 
Georg Brandes will for the first time in the 
English language deal readably and author- 
itatively with its deeply interesting subject. 
Finally, we can name the titles only of such 
books as Mr. Edmund Gosse's " Hypolymia, or 
The Gods in the Island," Mr. Richard Garnett's 
" Essays of an Ex-Librarian," a new volume 
of essays by Mr. Augustine Birrell, Professor 
Henry A. Beers's " History of English Roman- 
ticism in the Nineteenth Century," Captain 
Sir Richard F. Burton's " Wanderings in 
Three Continents," and the late Benjamin 
Harrison's "Views of an Ex- President." 

Coming last of all to poetry and fiction, we 
note under the former category only one book 
that can be safely taken beforehand as a con- 
tribution to the permanent treasures of the 
language. That book is Mr, W. E. Henley's 
" Hawthorn and Lavender," a volume of lyrics 
that will be sure to have the true singing qual- 
ity. On the other hand, the promised output 
of novels seems to include more interesting 
titles than we remember to have seen brought 
together at one time. Here, indeed, the hope- 
less nature of our task becomes most evident, 
for who shall say in advance what successes 
are to be soored by the fiction of the year? 
Confining ourselves to well-known writers, we 
will at least mention a few books that can be 
bought on faith and on the reputation of their 
predecessors. Here is the random list : " The 
Right of Way," by Mr. Gilbert Parker; 
" Some Women I Have Known," by "Maarten 
Maartens"; "The Secret Orchard," by Mr. 
and Mrs. Egerton Castle ; " New Canterbury 
Tales," by Mr. Maurice Hewlett ; " A Maid 
of Venice," by Mr. F. Marion Crawford ; "The 
Cavalier," by Mr. George W. Cable ; " Kim," 
by Mr. Rudyard Kipling ; " Tristram of 
Blent," by " Anthony Hope " ; " Circumstance," 
by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell ; and " Count Hanni- 
bal," by Mr. Stanley J. Weyman.

THREE LYRI CAL A NTHOLOGIES. 

Shortly before his death Francis Turner Palgrave 
pat forth the fifth book of " The Golden Treasury," 
thus completing, as far as he could do, a work which 
has had more influence on recent English literature 
than almost any other book. The determination 
of poetry to the lyric form was probably decided 
before. Burns, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, 
and Poe, the great influences, were lyric; democ- 
racy, with its dispersion, its lack of criticism, was 
lyric; even science, with its denial of design, its 
reference of the frame of things to spontaneous 
genesis, was lyric. Everything thus held together, 
and Falgrave's book came at the right moment to 
fix the tendency to regard the Song as the highest, 
almost the only, form of poetry. It was perhaps a 
necessary phase of human thought, though it will 
be a pity if it becomes permanent. With the Greek 
anthology, Greek literature practically came to an 
end. But the poets of Alexandria did not claim 
equality with the great Athenians. They were fall 
of admiration for them. Even the immodest Mar- 
tial, in late Roman literature, only put forth a 
modest claim for the short poem. But many mod- 
ern lyric poets, and the critics who aid and abet 
them, are of a different mind. They claim for 
their song a unity, an intensity, and a perfection 
denied to other kinds of literature. Certainly they 
are wrong. No lyric in existence has the unity, 
the totality of impression, of the great dramas and 
poems. As for intensity, there are single moments 
in Dante or Shakespeare which outblaze all the 
lyric poetry of the world. Among mountains the 
greatest masses push up the highest peaks. In 
execution alone, in splendor of music and phrase, 
can lyric poetry vie with the blank verse of our 
best poets. Aristotle demanded "a certain magni- 
tude" for literary greatness, and he ignored lyric 
verse: "nor am I confident he erred." But the 
deed is done; modern poetry is overwhelmingly 
lyrical, and it is worth while to try to assess some 
of the results. 

We open the lately-added fifth book of Falgrave's 
" Grolden Treasury " expecting to find Tennyson 
enthroned supreme; and the surprise is great when 
we discover Arnold usurping the seat of rule. The 
number of lines quoted from each is about the same, 
but it is impossible not to feel that the weight and 
power is with Arnold. Tennyson's shorter bursts 
of keen and piercing song are fairly quoted, but 
not his rich earlier music ; and it would seem that 
Palgrave had deliberately set aside his most massy 
and profound pieces. " The Palace of Art," " In 
Memoriam," "Maud," the Duke of Wellington ode, 
have no place. Instead of these, Palgrave gives 
the later ballads, dramatic realizations of eccentric 
character or embodiments of pathetic themes. With 
the exception of " Rizpah," these hardly seem to me 
of sufficient importance to shoulder aside the more 
exclusively lyrical work of a great lyrical poet. 



Browning is abundantly represented, but again 
dramatic narrative takes the place of those pieces 
where with intensity of pathos Browning atones, if 
at all, for a lack of simplicity and sensuousness. 
"Evelyn Hope," I should say, is worth half the 
things quoted. Specifically, Browning is hardly a 
poet at all, though a subtle and stimulating intel- 
lect. Had he gone in for law, he would have been 
the g^eat«st special pleader in England; had he 
entered the Church, he might have become the 
Head Master of the Jesuits. There is a good deal 
of Barnes and Clare, who were especial pets of Pal- 
grave's. Their poems hardly seem to me more than 
pretty. David Gray, who is not admitted, had 
probably a more intense gift than either. One of 
the surprises of the book is the prominence given 
to O'Shaughnessy. By one of Palgrave's most 
felicitous touches of arrangement, his best poem 
opens the section, and gives a promise hardly ful- 
filled by the rest of his work, which has a delicate 
etheriality suggestive of both Shelley and Poe, but 
far inferior to either. 

All in all, the "Golden Treasury" is a wonder- 
ful book. Using the poems of others, Palgrave 
has made a mosaic of his own — a work of design 
and creative art. Many other collections exist 
which contain the same poems and masses of equal 
work. But in all these the pieces are ill-arranged ; 
they are chaotically heaped; they swear at each 
other; they have no general effect But in Pal- 
grave's work, so true is the tone from beginning to 
end, so absolute the harmony, that the poems help 
each other with reflected lustre ; they deepen each 
other's notes with choral echo. This effect has been 
produced by ruthless suppression of much of the 
mightiest lyric poetry of the language. Palgrave 
knew what he was about, and sacrificed without 
pity, especially in the earlier editions of his book, 
many a piece whose brilliancy or whose glare woald 
have thrown his general sober coloring out, as he 
did many a one whose elemental power would have 
been dissonance in his cultured orchestra. The 
fierce expressions of love, of revolt, of despair, — 
ecstatic visions or opium dreams, — nothing of these 
is here. And what is the result ? The book brings 
up before us a perfect image of that England which 
we all keep in our thoughts — the image of a land 
of rich woods and long-tamed fields, of flowery 
hedges and rose-fronted cottages, of war-cradled 
castles and pensive homes of fame. No stain is on 
the picture, which is one of ordered splendor and 
secluded peace. 

Turn now to the " Treasury of Irish Poetry," 
edited by Mr. Stopford A. Brooke and Mr. T. W. 
Bolliston. Everything that is wanting in Palgrave's 
volume is here. The Celtic madness and the Celtic 
inspiration — the glamor of a ghostly past, the 
bloodthirsty cry of exultation, the wail of defeat, 
the farewell of exile — revolt and fury and fun — 
all these are here. Comparing the two books, one 
might almost say that Ireland has been in a spirit-

ual as well as a physical sense the breakwater of 
England; that the force of the ocean of passion 
and the fury of the stomas of thought had been 
expended upon it, leaving the English spirit to ride 
at anchor in the calm beyond. Palgrave could not 
have admitted "The Jolly Beggars," but "The 
Night Before Larry was Stretched " is a matter of 
course in the Irish Anthology. Yet, the purity of 
the Celtic poetry is notable. Archness and gal- 
lantry there is in plenty, but no taint of sensuality. 
The Irish Celt is an idealist, while his Scottish 
brother and his Saxon foe are both liable to lapses 
of the flesh which often make their song defiant of 
decency. 

We have heard a good deal of the Celtic Revi- 
val recently, and have had perhaps a dim suspicion 
that the young leaders of this movement belonged 
to the amiable body of Log-Rollers. It was Mat- 
thew Arnold who, more than anyone else, revealed 
to them the genius of their race ; and they have 
been making some rather unfounded claims based 
upon his criticism. Take, for example, the matter 
of style — of natural magic in expression. Judg- 
ing from Messrs. Brooke and Rolliston's selections, 
I should say that with a single astounding excep- 
tion the modern Irish poets fail in the very quality 
which Arnold indicated by that term, and which he 
thought entered into English poetry from Celtic 
sources. English poetry tends to the pictorial, Irish 
to the musical. Now style is really a two-fold thing 
of form and phrase. Form is that gift which looks 
before and after — which regards the unity, the 
flow, the total effect of a whole piece; phrase is 
the concentrated flash, the ruddy flush in the words. 
The Irish poets are preeminent in the first quality. 
Beside their art, so profound as to seem unpremed- 
itated, of easy lilt and interwoven rhyme and 
echoing refrain, Shelley himself is cramped and 
Swinburne monotonous. They have doubtless in- 
herited this art from the Celtic bards of old, who 
made a business of poetry, and went about with a 
train of apprentices, and kept school for the mys- 
teries of rhythm and rhyme. But for the appoint- 
ment of words to body forth a visual image, the 
modern men at least have no particular genius. If 
Irish verse were challenged to tell down its coins of 
speech line by line with contemporary English or 
American poetry, it would be bankrupted before 
the others had begun to draw upon their treasuries. 
There is, however, as I have said, one remarkable 
exception, George Darley, and the five or six pieces 
in the collection quoted from him burn and blaze 
like a handful of opals amid a mass of colorless 
crystals. Palgrave slipped one of his poems — 
" True Loveliness" — into the Seventeenth Century 
section of the " Golden Treasury " as originally pub- 
lished, and it has passed muster ever since as an 
exceptionally beautiful poem of that age. An even 
greater piece is quoted from the " Fight of the For- 
lorn." There is nothing like this in English litera- 
ture save Gray's few translations from the Norse, 
and they are pale in comparison. 



Even James Clarence Mangan, the greatest 
name in modern Irish poetry, is not a stylist in the 
sense of mastery of vivid words, but he is second 
only to Poe in richness of rhythm, haunting melo- 
dy, and the power of total effect. " My Dark Ros- 
aleen," " Karaman," " A Vision of Connaught," 
"Gone in the Wind," — these and many others are 
potent and overwhelming poems. They demand 
to be read aloud, to be chanted, and, like certain 
strains of music, they almost compel the listener to 
rise to his feet — to dance, to express in motion the 
feelings they convey. 

Emotion, then, rather than intellect, is the mark 
of Irish verse. From the Street Ballads, through 
Tom Moore, Lover, Callanan, Gerald Griffin, Sir 
Samuel Ferguson, Aubrey de Vere, and Graves, 
down to the younger men and women of to-day, 
Irish poetry cries, laughs, threatens, despairs, in 
verse which is the very echo of the meaning. A 
sense of the contrast between Ireland's romantic 
past and its deplorable present is always in the 
poet's mind, whoever he may be. No literature is 
so affectionately national. And no literature, it is 
to be feared, ever effected so little practically. 
Ossian's Celt, " who always went out to fight, but 
who always fell," seems the permanent type. 

It is refreshing to have left in the world a race 
which knows nothing about common sense, but 
which, at least, has never mistaken the glint of the 
guinea for the rising of the sun, and which has 
always been as easily intoxicated by wit and poetry 
as by potheen. The literature of this race is gifted 
and attractive, but it would be uncritical to praise 
it as a revelation or place it among the great liter- 
atures of the world. It is doubtful whether it can 
show any work of the first importance, and it has 
a narrow range. Irish poetry is local. English 
poetry is cosmopolitan. English wits have never 
been home-keeping youth. Before England sent 
her fleets to the four quarters of the earth to gather 
old empires and new discovered continents into its 
ring-fence of rule, the English poets swept over all 
times and climes and made booty of the best themes 
and figures of the distant and the past. They seized 
upon the heroes of other races to be the Janissaries 
of their poetic array ; they made a Circassia of 
every country to stock their seraglios of song. En- 
gland's greatest epic is Hebrew; its mightiest 
dramas, Roman, Italian, and Danish ; its greatest 
history is European. Splendid piracy! — but the 
result is that English poetry is the most imperial 
poetry of the world. 

Palgrave's Anthology covers a period of three 
hundred years of poetic bloom ; the Irish Treasury 
extends over thrice that time, for a great part of 
the poems are translations or imitations of the 
ancient Gaelic. The recently published book of 
Mr. Stedman includes only one hundred years of 
American song. How do we stand the comparison? 
Miraculously well, considering the enormous diffi- 
culties our poets have had to contend with. They 
have been under a tacit convention to deal only 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

with home themes. Yet American life has been 
new, it has been prosperous, and it has been domes- 
tic, — thiee disenchanting conditions for poetry to 
deal with. Generation after generation of the 
leaves of song have not fallen to enrich the soil for 
fairer growths. The spirit of oar nation has not 
been unified by foreign conquest on any large scale, 
or deepened by disaster at home. Our national 
ideal has been to get rich. We have believed that 
we could be saved by commerce and made glorious 
by manufactures. Yet the American public is some- 
what inconsistent. It thanks Grod, like Audrey, 
that it is not poetical, — yet it bridles up with anger 
when a candid friend ventures the same opinion. 
"What!" it says, "have we not all the heredita- 
ments and appurtenances of human beings ? Are 
not our men brave? Are not our women beautiful, 
and therefore, ex officio, poetical? Have we not 
had sieges, battles, backwoods life, and piratical 
adventures? What more do you want? One can 
only say that these things are facts, and that facts 
have to suffer a sea-change before they can become 
poetical. Out of the millions of great hap(}ening8 
of the world, out of the myriads of millions of 
heroic or beautiful human beings, how many have 
become permanently interesting and poetical? En- 
gland has had a hundred wars, but only two of 
these, perhaps, — the War of the Roses and the 
Scotch Invasion of the Young Pretender, — were 
of much use for poetry or romance. Why do poets 
cling to the Tale of Troy and Pelop's line? Why 
have they hailed with delight the revival of the 
cycle of Norse myths and the Irish legends ? For 
one reason, a subject does not become poetical all 
at once. The fact must be half forgotten and a 
slow accretion of fancy grow around it. History 
is not poetical, and legend is. What specially 
qualifies a subject for poetry it is impossible to say. 
It is enough that a poet can seldom make a theme 
poetical out of his own head. 

All the greater American writers have instinct- 
ively known these truths, they have felt the bare- 
ness of American life, and, each in his own way, 
have fought against it. Hawthorne did a great 
trade in importing to our shores the abstractions 
and allegories and ipantastic imaginations of the Old 
World. Longfellow and Cooper idealized the In- 
dian and the Backwoodsman, and the dark and 
bloody borderland which they discovered is one of 
the few things of American experience which has 
impressed itself on foreign literature. Poe turned 
his back on realities, and colonized a region of inter- 
stellar space with wraiths of human fate and 
phantoms of his own imagination. Everybody 
experimented. 

It is not my desire to claim for the body of im- 
aginative work so produced equality with the con- 
temporary literatures of other countries. It is 
certainly inferior to that of France, and probably 
to that of England. But lyric poetry does not 
depend so much on subject. In it the poet's soul 
and art are the prime factors. And here it seems 



to me we have no need to take off our hats to any 
literature in the world. Take the three Anthologies 
I have been comparing : Mr. Stedman's volume 
enormously outweighs Mr. Brooke's in intellectual 
force and splendor of language. And Poe alone 
sums up and surpasses the special Celtic gifts of 
unity, impression, and music. The issue between 
Mr. Stedman and Palgrave is more doubtful. Let 
us run over the muster-roll of the chiefs on either 
side, — name the warriors who must meet in single 
combat in the middle field. Against Tennyson we 
must send forth Poe. Tennyson is immensely the 
most varied, but he is in great part derivative, a 
good deal of his work is trivial, and he has no new 
secrets of art to communicate. Poe is sole, original, 
self-born. His every stroke tells, and as a teacher 
of technique he is only beginning his career. I 
believe the judgment of posterity will follow that 
of foreign nations, and count him the victor. Ar- 
nold is a harder man to dispose of. Emerson is 
more than his match in high thought, and deep, 
divine, pellucid phrase ; but, unfortunately, he sel- 
dom moulded thought and vivid words into good 
poetic wholes. To oppose him to Arnold is like 
sending out a boy with a handful of golden pebbles 
to fight a knight incased in glittering armor. As 
a lyric poet, Whitman would overwhelm and oblit- 
erate Browning. I neither object to nor admire 
Whitman's metre. It gives up most of the ad- 
vantages of verse, yet it is a sufficiently sounding 
instrument; and when Whitman gets rid of his 
price-current lists of poetic materials, and gives as 
a poem with a theme, a poem with a beginning, a 
middle, and an end, he is very great. His two best 
pieces are large and glowing odes, and are stamped 
with immortality. Longfellow's poetry has lost a 
good deal of its original brightness, but still we may 
leave him to take care of the English ladies, Mrs. 
Browning and Miss Rossetti. Lowell, with his 
Barns-like ardor and his Drydenic energy of line, 
is surely equal to Rossetti. Both are stylists, and 
Lowell has the better themes. No English inheritor 
of the lyre of Wordsworth has drawn such austere 
and majestic strains from that instrument as Bryant. 
As for the ranked followers of these leaders, they 
are at least most numerous on the American side. 
There are in particular a great number of writers 
of single poems which are or will become classics. 
Edward Coates Pinckney's " A Health " (our best 
love-song), Ticknor's "The Virginians of the Val- 
ley," Cooke's "Florence Vane," O'Hara's "Bivouac 
of the Dead " (a poem which if its verbiage were 
cut out would outrival the masterpieces of Campbell 
and Wolfe), Parson's " Lines on a Bust of Dante," 
and Ly tie's " Antony to Cleopatra," — these are a 
few of the superb estrays of our literature. On 
the whole, I do not hesitate to claim for American 
lyrical verse an equal place with England's con- 
temporary work. 

A nation's crown is won at last by the song of 
the poet.

COMMUNICA TION. 



THE SONNETS OF DE HEREDIA. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The appreciative notice, in your issue of July 16, of 
Mr. Frank Sewall's excellent translation of " The 
Trophies " of Jos^ Maria de Heredia leads me to sup- 
pose versions of two of the sonnets, lying by me, may 
be of interest to your readers. They were made seven 
or eight years ago, on the appearance of M. de Here- 
dia's book. M. de Heredia has a way of fitting the 
movement of his verse exquisitely to the thought, which 
of course, like the other subtle beauties of his work- 
manship, is quite inimitable. In order faintly to hint 
it, I have allowed myself an anapaestic movement in 
the sonnet called The Conquistadores, Mr. Sewall's 
version of which you have quoted. This will at least 
institute a contrast between its tone and the dreamy 
air of the Cartagena, however illegitimate such a move- 
ment may be thought to be in a sonnet. 

THE CONQUISTADORES. 

Like a flii^ht of gerfalcons out of their nest, 
Tired of the pomp that exalts but enslaves, 
From Palos or Moguer, the captains and braves 

Sailed forth, by a vision heroic possessed. 

Of the fabulous wealth they were going in quest 
That Cipango had ripened in far-away caves. 
And the trade-winds were driving them over the waves 

To the mysterious shores of a world in the West. 

Each evening, in hopes of an epical morrow, 

A golden mirage for their dreams they would borrow 

From the phosphorent blue of the tropical sea ; 

Or over the prow they would gaze wistfully. 
And watch from the depths of the ocean arise 
Strange stars climbing slowly the unknown skies. 

TO A DKAD TOWN. 

[Cartagena of the Indies, 1532-158S-1697 .] 

Ah, mournful town ! once ocean's queen wert thou, 
And to thy harbor giant galleons drew, 
Where unscared birds in peace their prey pursue 

And errant clouds alone cast shadow now. 

Black heaps, thy crumbling walls lie low enow, — 
Such work did Drake and England's miscreant crew, — 
While Pointis' bullets, pearls of ebon hue, 

With coronet of glory ring thy brow. 

Between the burning sky and murmuring sea, 
When noontide casts the spell of sleep on thee, 

These old conquistadors come back in dreams ; 
And, in the stillness of the hot night-calms, 

Thou nursest thy old glory, and it seems 
Returned to thee a-slumbering 'neath thy palms.

liEAVBS FROM A BUST IjIFE.* 

" Is it possible that by any even chance pos- 
terity can get hold of these egotistic letters 
and hold me up to the howls of hoi polloi ? " 
inquires " Gail Hamilton " in one of them. 
And hoi polloi, who were her eager supporters 
through a life of varied usefulness — and mis- 
chief, will be glad to know that their knowledge 
of that bright and indefatigable personality is 
not to end with her published writings, innu- 
merable as these were, but is to go on to the 
greater intimacy which her sister has now made 
possible. 

" Gail Hamilton," as most of at least the 
older readers know, is the pen-name of Mary 
Abigail Dodge, the " Gail " from the final 
syllable of her middle name and the " Hamil- 
ton " from the little town in Massachusetts 
where she was born, as had been her ancestors 
for some hundreds of years. Her life extended 
from March, 1833 (the day of birth is not 
given), to August 17, 1896. Into these sixty- 
three years she crowded the work of many 
personalities, busying herself about scores of 
projects, writing not less than twenty-six vol- 
umes of prose, verse, juvenilia, essays, history, 
biography, politics, sermons, editorials, biblical 
exegesis, and what not. Some of these topics, 
but not all, can be found discussed in the two 
duodecimo volumes containing 1090 pages 
which have been massed together by an elder 
sister. Miss Hannah Augusta Dodge, to whom 
many of the letters were addressed. 

Through her whole life, Miss M. A. Dodge 
insisted upon the separation of her private per- 
sonality from that involved in her authorship 
and public writings. Letters sent to " Miss 
Abigail Dodge " she refused to answer. She 
always felt it a burden upon her to have the two 
sides of her life brought together, and believed 
that her power would have been magnified 
greatly if her pen-name had remained a secret. 
Yet she took the frankest pleasure in the 
measure of fame her published work brought 
her, and these letters reveal a desire for praise 
and appreciation which is almost childlike. 

In the face of this fact, the good taste of 
such an exposure as is here made of her inmost 
heart is questionable ; nor has the editor showed 
the highest qualities of her office in making

her selections. Small matters which shed no 
light upon the character of Gail Hamilton, 
little personalities which must work harm to 
the living, crude ideas which were carefully 
worked over for public print, and a thousand 
minor matters which should have had minute 
censorship, are among the sins of commission ; 
while great gaps in the author's life, failure to 
mention some of the most important things in 
her career, or to glean from her letters expres- 
sions of opinion on historical facts where her 
opinion would have been valuable, are as evi- 
dently sins of omission. Such is the absence 
of any reference to Miss Dodge's connection 
with the family of James G. Blaine, a connec- 
tion first one of blood alone, but soon deepening 
into one of warm and almost bitter partisanship 
in the objects of Blaine's ambition. More ex- 
asperating still is the editor's fancy that her 
function does not extend to the correction of 
obvious errors, even of spelling, though she 
must have known that these are literally the 
first of her sister's writings to be given the 
public without such consideration. One reads 
of "Raphael Meng," "Hamilton Aidee," 
" Gen. Berdau," " Mrs. McVeigh," and many 
more. The use of initials for persons who do 
not wish to be better known is also annoying, 
and the occasional use of an illuminating foot- 
note takes away all excuse for there not being 
hundreds more to cast light upon dark places 
and give these letters their full value. Xor is 
it possible, except in the minority of instances, 
to learn to whom the letters are addressed at 
any given time. More specific defects may be 
noted on page 695, where a word dropped 
from one line into another makes the latter 
read " fault it was the fault of society "; on 
page 998, where " a pair of O's " should evi- 
dently read " a pair of naughts "; while the 
use of the expression " contrabander " in a 
letter given date as of September 25, 1859, 
must surely have been written after General 
Butler's decision in 1861 had made that term 
applicable to the negro slaves of the South 
(p. 245). These faults, and many more easily 
perceptible, should find correction in the second 
edition, to which we hope the book will come. 
For, in spite of everything, there was little 
that Gail Hamilton did during her public 
life which was not interesting, and her writings, 
whether in public prints or to private persons, 
have the charm of a fascinating and always 
intelligent personality. She had a clever knack 
of hitting ojff the characteristics of those with 
whom she was brought into contact, of which 



the following account of an experience in Con- 
cord, Mass., in June, 1855, is a good example: 
" Rose Hawthorne met me at the statioD, and I was 
cordially welcomed. . . . Thursday evening, Emerson, 
William Ellery Channing, and < Conversation Alcott ' 
called. Emerson and Alcott occupied me most of the 
evening. Emerson has the sweetest smile possible, is 
very courteous, speaks slowly but distinctly. . . . After 
they were gone, Mr. H. [Hawthorne] took out his 
watch, and with an indescribable look towards me, said, 
' Only half-past nine, and we have been through all this 
siege.' . . . Saturday, Mr. H., Una, and I walked to 
Walden in the morning, went to Mr. Emerson's on the 
way to get his oars and thole-pins. The philosopher 
took us out into the bam, and climbed over old sleighs 
and wagons, dug down under old boards, brought up 
one rusty thole-pin, one short oar and one long one, and 
transmitted us through the back bars to Walden. His 
sister-in-law told me afterwards that she asked him 
when he came in if he had been shutting Gail Hamil- 
ton up in the cow-yard, as she saw him putting up the 
bars. . . . The boat we fonnd, but padlocked to a tree; 
the oars, stool, thole-pins, and everything, locked down. 
We lamented the inhospitality of the owner, and Haw- 
thorne said, < Miss Dodge, get in the boat and sit down 
on this seat. Perhaps he wonldn 't like it.' " 

In this same paragraph Mr. Frank Sanborn is 
mentioned, the recently published volume on 
Emerson from his hand bringing a vastly re- 
moved past and the immediate present into 
almost perplexing contact. Here is a portrait 
of her host, Nathaniel Hawthorne, taken some 
time later : 

" He is a glorious man, a very ideal man in his per- 
sonal appearance, with an infinite forehead, his gray, 
dry, long hair thrown back from it in all directions, 
deep lamps of eyes glowing out from under their heavy 
arches, black eyebrows and moustache, a florid, healthy 
face — a pure, sensitive, reticent, individual man whom 
it is enough to have seen, to have looked at, to have 
been in the same house with. He talks little, but he 
talks extremely well." 

" Mary Abby Dodge," as she called herself, 
was at the first inaugural ball given President 
Lincoln, and leaves this sketch of it : 

<< It was so late before Mr. Lincoln came that they 
began to dance before he got there. When he came, 
the band struck up ' Hail to the Chief Who in Triumph 
Advances.' Everybody formed on each side of the 
room, leaving a passage between, Mr. Lincoln being 
conducted through it, bowing right and left, to a raised 
platform at the end of the room. Mrs. Lincoln fol- 
lowed, led by Mr. Douglas. Then the crowd filed np 
and were introduced. Before this was half through we 
went out to supper, and when they came back, my 
attendant . . . took me up. I said, ' Mr. Lincoln, I 
am very sorry for you, but indeed I must shake hands.' 
He then gave me another shake, and with a very pater- 
nal and benevolent and gentle squeeze, said, < Ah! your 
hand does n't hurt me,' and then the crowd came np 
and I passed on." 

This is capital, but lacks just the touch of per- 
sonal portraiture that she gave Buchanan, of 
whom she said :

[Sept. 16, 



" He is tall and stout, with a very vi^ite, flabby face, 
and something peculiar about one of his eyes. He 
wore black, and a white cravat, and seems old." 

William Lloyd Garrison, as he appeared iu 
his native town of Newburyport in 1865, is 
also happily described : 

" There he sat upon the platform, a bland old man 
with a shining white head, a few side-locks brushed 
smoothly down by his ears, a conservative, solid-man- 
of-Boston-looking person, with not the smallest evil 
design against the existing order of things. . . . That 
evening I was invited to supper with him, and the next 
morning drove over with him to Whittier's, where I 
remained till Saturday, feeling, as I always do with 
Whittier, a kind of demi-goddess, simply by force of 
association, not from any inward spouting. And so 
Garrison and Whittier reminisced, . . . and I saw the 
inside of many things of which I had previously seen 
only the outside, and even that often through a glass 
darkly." 

Of Whittier Miss Dodge speaks frequently, 
and her letters to him are among the most in- 
teresting in the volumes, tender, humorous, 
bright, and uniformly deferential. Some of 
the things she says about him and his sister 
are well worth setting down. 

" Is n't Whittier irresistible ? Is n't the Merrimac 
peerless ? Do n't talk about the Arno aud the Rhine. 
They 're no better than the Merrimac, and I do n't be- 
lieve there [they ?] are any such rivers, either. Is n't 
Whittier even sweet ? Is n't their Charles and Mary 
Lambness a perpetual poem ? " 

" I went to Amesbury, to Whittier's. . . . They did 
not know I was coming. I rang the bell, was shown 
into the sitting-room where Miss Whittier sat reading 
facing the door, and he writing, back, ditto. . . . He 
jumped up aud came to me with both hands extended. 
* Why, it is Gail Hamilton,' and then we all three 
walked into Paradise, shut the gate, and threw away 
the key. . . . Miss W. is a modest, large-eyed, but not 
beautiful woman, gentle, timid rather, but opening to 
acquaintance — not well, full of tastes and sympathies 
and sense, no silliness — heart not very demonstrative, 
nor very the contrary. He is the king of men, and 
what is the good of talking ? " 

A few additional characterizations and crit- 
icisms must be included : 

" Young Henry James, I think, is one of the most 
promising writers we have. His stories are studies. 
He has a way and a thought of his own. How much 
there is in this last story of his just begun. [This was 
in April, 1867, four years before his first published 
book.] All his stories have body. His women, if they 
are wicked or foolish, have their own way of being so. 
They are not the old block women handed down by 
tradition, with only the change of waterfalls and rats, 
or whatever is the last new style." 

"Maria Mitchell, the astronomer, was there, about 
fifty or so, iron gray hair in curls, dark and rather 
masculine complexion, fine eyes, peculiar mouth, rather 
full lips, talks rapidly aud a little recklessly like me 

— saucy and witty, and funny and entirely original — 
and very natural — and gives you an idea of strength 

— not in the least seminary-ish, or teacher-ish, or fine 
lady-ish, or pedantic." ■ 



" Professor and Mrs. Stowe appeared. . . . They 
stayed until near four o'clock. The first half-hour I 
did not like her. After she came out to her lunch she 
glowed up and was very simple, natural, agreeable, and 
entertaining. About half an hour before she went 
away she gave out again and was silent, but I under- 
stood it and did not mind. He rallied her and declared 
she did not come up to his expectations. . . . She is 
plain at first sight, but not after five minutes. Her 
face is very attractive and her smile charming and 
sometimes very expressive. When she was silent it 
said a great deal. . . . They are evidently very happy 
together." 

" I heard Charles Dickens read the other night. It

both together they are absorbing. My eyes ached all

think his voice naturally particularly fine, but he uses 
it with great effect. He has wonderful dramatic power 
— a command over his face which recalls the old stories 
of Garriek. He reproduces, recreates almost(,) the 
characters with whom his pen has made you familiar. 
I like him better than any public reader I have ever 
beard. He has less mouthing and unnaturalness." 

" Gail Hamilton," it will be remembered, 
had a certain reputation as a public scold, which 
these letters of hers do little to diminish. Here 
is a really choice bit of sarcasm : 

" Quite an event happened in church yesterday. A 
minister got hold of an idea, — not our own, but a 
neighboring clergyman, — a man of rut aud routine, — 
got a real, living truth on his lips, and announced it as 
the theme of his discourse, and I sat wondering where- 
unto this thing would grow, and mentally warning him, 
a la Joe Gargery, ' Pip, old chap, you '11 do yourself a 
mischief. You can't have chawed it, Pip! ' However, 
he did no more harm with it than a child with a silver 
dollar. It was too big for him to swallow, so he did 
not strangle, and he was not strong enough to hurl it 
away, so he neither lost it uor broke the windows with 
it, but quietly put it in his pocket, and walked home 
under his umbrella, complacently unconscious of the 
jewel he had been sporting with." 

The more spiritual side of the letters is by 
no means the least interesting part of them. 
The steady growth of liberal ideas, from the 
beginnings in old-fashioned New England 
" Orthodoxy " to an acceptance of " St. Her- 
bert Spencer " beside St. James and St. Paul, 
is set forth with force and candor. So, too, 
are her views on the duties and privileges of 
authorship, and her sense of woman's place 
in the world. To some correspondent, prob- 
ably a kinswoman, she has something to say 
about the papers which are prepared and read 
in women's clubs, none the less pertinent be- 
cause it was written in 1885 : 

«' It requires a great deal more and a great deal 
higher skill to write a paper on Mrs. Browning than it 
does to make a shoe. Nothing that you, or probably 
any other member of the club, should write about 
Mrs. Browning would be worth reading, because writ- 
ing that is worth reading can no more be done by an

amateur in a fortnight than can a statue, or a temple, 
or a picture. Not that you could not have made the 
best of writers, but nobody can write without practice, 
any more than he can speak French. Remember above 
all things not to worry about that essay. If you do n't 
worry about it, it will be only because you do n't know 
enough about writing to know what a weight and 
work it is." 

It may be said, in conclusion, that the index 
is deplorably meagre, and requires expansion 
to double the present size, to be adequate to 
the book. There is a failure to refer some of 
the most interesting letters to the persons ad- 
dressed, — the one beginning on page 819 
(possibly to James G. Blaine) being a notice- 
able example. Yet the book, for all its short- 
comings, is one to be read and re-read, not only 
for the entertainment it affords, but also for the 
light it casts upon many places in our literary 
and political history. Wallace Rice. 



A New History of the americax 
PEon.E.* 



A suggestion made by George Washington 
regarding the importance of educating public 
opinion furnishes the keynote of Professor 
Thorpe's latest publication, " A History of the 
American People." This is apparently de- 
signed to meet the long-felt want of a one-vol- 
ume history of the United States for the use 
of the reader in the home rather than for a 
text-book in school or college. The six hun- 
dred pages of the volume are readily grouped 
into chapters relating to three themes : the 
consideration of legal and constitutional ques- 
tions, the discussion of changes and improve- 
ments in social conditions, and the account of 
the running history from Columbus to the 
present day, — this last apparently being the 
least important in the general scheme. 

The style is that of the college lecture, with 
topical rather than chronological treatment, 
and with frequent pauses for recapitulation and 
retrospect. This method encourages repetition, 
and unless carefully watched plays havoc with 
chronology, especially when several somewhat 
distinct lectures are bound together into a book 
for connected reading. Class-room lectures 
must often be technical, with many a reference 
and illustration ; and not every successful lec- 
turer in the class-room can use his material 
satisfactorily for the larger audience of the 
reading public. Mr. Thorpe's sentences often 

*A HiSTOKY OF THE AMERICAN People. By Francig 
Newton Thorpe. Chicago : A. C. McClnrg & Co. 



drag their weary length along through involved 
clauses into obscure paragraphs, and it is not 
uncommon to find ideas and suggestions in the 
book suffering from a lack of clearness in the 
language used to describe them. A typical 
illustration is the sentence, " One of the Sen- 
ators from Florida and Nebraska was of En- 
glish birth." In the method employed, in the 
character of the literary style, and in the ne- 
cessity of condensation in order to cover four 
centuries in a single volume, Mr. Thorpe has 
found three serious obstacles in the way of his 
laudable endeavor to make an easy-to-read, in- 
teresting story of American progress. 

The development of American constitutional 
law, especially as illustrated by a study of State 
constitutions, forms the backbone of the his- 
tory, as it has done for three or four other 
publications by this author. There is no more 
interesting field for investigation than this, and 
Mr. Thorpe has profited from frequent excur- 
sions into it. In the present instance several 
of the faults of former histories have disap- 
peared, the condensation of the subject-matter 
being noticeable in comparison. Even yet, 
however, the difficulties of long and involved 
sentences present themselves, and useless rep- 
etitions mar otherwise interesting paragraphs. 
There may well be question, too, whether the 
average reader cares so much for detail regard- 
ing constitutional changes in various decades, 
and whether many other topics might not sat- 
isfactorily have been disposed of by the com- 
mon footnote reference to the author's " Con- 
stitutional History." 

The chapters of the second group, which are 
devoted to a study of social life, are interesting 
and suggestive. They contain a vast amount 
of matter, so much, indeed, that the proper 
distribution of it into readable sentences must 
have been a difficult undertaking. Changes in 
manners, customs, habits of life, material com- 
forts, and the modes of thought of the people, 
make good subjects for description, and the 
only danger, perhaps, comes from a tendency 
to generalize. 

The third group of chapters includes those 
that tell the general history of the country. 
The pages devoted to colonial life are very 
readable, and in the main are carefully worked 
out. Those concerned with the history from 
the time of Washington's administration to the 
present are marred by many inaccurate state- 
ments, half-truths, anachronisms, and com- 
parisons with conditions of " to-day," a sort of 
essay feature not valuable in a finished history.

Discussing the political situation in 1793, it is 
stated of England that " she treated our min- 
ister, John Adams, with meagre politeness," — 
a disposition of that statesman which would 
tend to increase his discontent with the Vice- 
Presidency, if he were to read about it in Mr. 
Thorpe's book. The importance of the treaty 
with Spain in 1795 is set forth, and then the 
southern boundary of the United States, the 
most important feature of the treaty, is wrong- 
ly described. In the account of the election 
of 1796 occurs an example of a very common 
fault — carelessness as regards chronology. 
The candidates are mentioned, the results of 
the vote are stated, the method of voting in the 
various States is described, and then the decli- 
nation of Washington is discussed in such 
words as to suggest that it followed the election 
instead of preceding it. In like manner there 
is a description of Perry's victory at Put-in-Bay, 
where reference is made to Lawrence's famous 
utterance, although the account of Lawrence's 
battle is given in a succeeding paragraph. In 
the account of the Civil War, one paragraph 
ends with the words, " Vicksburg remained the 
only obstruction to the free navigation of the 
river," and the next one is given up entirely to 
an account of the taking of New Orleans. On 
" the 23d of July McClelland was relieved of 
the chief command and restricted to command 
of the army of the Potomac. A series of en- 
gagements now began, culminating in the bat- 
tle of Fair Oaks, May 31." On page 446 Ten- 
nessee joined the Confederacy ; on page 447 
Tennessee " kept in the Union." The Holy 
Alliance appears from the text to be planning 
in 1818 to help Spain " beat down those new 
American Republics and to regain her colon- 
ies," although on a previous page the year 1820 
is mentioned as the date of beginning of the 
Spanish- American revolutions. These are typ- 
ical examples, in every one of which the reader, 
unless otherwise fortified, will be misled as to 
the true sequence of events. 

The chapter on Reconstruction is a disap- 
pointment in the light of present history, and 
more recent developments in our national life 
find faulty treatment. It is hard to account 
for the author's version of the incidents just 
prior to the beginning of the Spanish- American 
war, which might easily have been described 
correctly if there had been an examination of 
the published diplomatic correspondence of that 
period. Mr. Thorpe records : " President Mc- 
Kinley appointed General Stewart L. Wood- 
ford minister to Spain. He neglected no op- 



portunity to conciliate the Spanish government 
and secure a peaceful solution of the Cuban 
question. He discovered that no such solution 
was possible." These are astonishing statements, 
in view of the fact that Minister Woodford's 
diplomatic correspondence gives no evidence 
of any such " discovery," but shows, on the 
contrary, that two of the three demands made 
by the United States government were imme- 
diately complied with and that steps were 
taken to secure the third. In fact, Mr. Wood- 
ford discovered such evidence of willingness 
on the part of the Spanish government to find 
a peaceful solution, that he himself felt it near, 
and urged the President to support his efforts 
to secure it. 

Mr. Thorpe is a manifest hero-worshipper, 
the eulogy of Lincoln and Grant being espe- 
cially marked. To show Jackson's popularity, 
the half-truth is stated that " Andrew Jackson 
was a typical American of his day. He had 
received more votes than were ever before cast 
for anybody in America." The account would 
have been more complete had he added that 
Jackson's opponent, John Quincy Adams, was 
another typical American of his day, and that 
he also received in this same election more 
votes than were ever before cast for anybody 
in America. The same spirit of hero-worship 
leads to the surprising statement, following 
the account of the Second War, " The war 
produced two popular heroes, the 'Hero of 
the Tippecanoe ' and the ' Hero of New Or- 
leans.' Ovations befell them thick and fast. 
Everybody said that each would be Presi- 
dent some day." Reading such nonsense, 
one wonders what disposition Mr. Thorpe 
would make of the attitude of the New York 
Democracy some years later, when Tennessee 
suggested Jackson for the presidency, and what 
method he would take to obscure the attitude of 
the Democrats toward the " imitation old hero " 
when Harrison was " mentioned" some twenty 
odd years after the battle of New Orleans. 

A few typographical errors occur, such as 
"George B. Meade," on p. 458; "Phohibi- 
tion," on p. 477; and the division of " Semmes " 
in two syllables, on p. 458. But the volume 
is in the main a good specimen of bookmaking 
and reflects credit upon the publishers. It is to 
be hoped, however, that they will take measures 
to put forth an edition of the work better fitted, 
by a full and searching revision, to fill their de- 
scription of it as a " comprehensive, scholarly, 
readable, and exact " history of our country.

Some Present-Day Methods in Ethics.* 

In the moral experience, as in the Bible, 
every man may find his favorite dogmas. The 
field is so broad and the phenomena are so 
complex that it is easy for a group of facts to 
seize and hold the attention when they agree 
with either preconceived theories or personal 
tastes. Thereupon these facts, in their sepa- 
ration from their context, will give just the 
results that the student desires to reach. 

This principle is illustrated in certain recent 
works on ethics. It is an indubitable truth, 
for instance, that there are persons who can 
answer the most complicated questions of con- 
duct with the readiness and the assurance of a 
" lightning calculator." Again, there are those 
for whom creature comforts and " outward suc- 
cess" are comparatively insignificant matters. 
What they desire most is nobility of character ; 
and this, not for what it brings but for what 
it is. Finally, to some members of this latter 
class the obligation to develope and strengthen 
character, as distinguished from the aspiration 
to that end, seems to have its source in a de- 
mand made upon them by God. Given a mind 
in which these phases of experience and this 
cast of temperament are predominant, and the 
outcome at one time usually was, and even to-day 
occasionally is, the theory called Intuitionism. 

Professor Davis's treatise on the " Elements 
of Ethics " is an excellent representative of this 
type of thought. The fundamental datum of 
ethics, he holds, is the recognition of a law 
which we are under obligation to obey. Its 
requirements we know by intuition. Its source 
is God. Our own response to the law, the 
consciousness of obligation, is an elementary 
and unique phenomenon, miraculously im- 
planted in us, it would seem, by our Creator. 
Such are a few of the leading doctrines of this 
little book, one of the most satisfactory com- 
pendia of orthodox Intuitionalism that has yet 
been written. But plausible as these views 
may appear to some persons, the demonstration 
that they overlook important phenomena is 
unwittingly supplied by the author when he

attempts to answer the question. What actions 
are commanded? The basis of ethics, he 
writes, is the intuition. " A man has a right 
to a free use of his native powers in the grati- 
fication of his normal desires." All trespass 
upon such rights is immoral. What desires, 
then, are normal ? The only reply that can be 
obtained from pages of exposition is the barren 
tautology — those desires which it is right for 
us to indulge. The traditional Intuitionistic 
theories never escape this rock. Thus severe 
is the penalty for neglecting facts. 

In Mr. Kedney's brief treatise on "Prob- 
lems in Ethics " we find again a mutilation of 
the moral experience in the interest of what 
appeals to the idiosyncracies of the writer ; but 
the mutilation proceeds, on the whole, upon 
other than conventional lines. His deepest 
longings go out to a social state in which every 
man can reckon upon the good-will, and, if 
necessity arises, the hearty, joyous cooperation 
or assistance of his fellow-men. That and that 
only is right which hastens the advent of this 
commonwealth. The supreme obligation is the 
development, in ourselves and others, of a 
character that will fit us for membership in 
such a society. In its failure to see anything 
in the moral experience except what appeals 
to a narrow, even if inspiring, ideal, Mr. 
Kedney's work does not even supply a genuine 
representation of the facts it succeeds in appre- 
hending. On the other hand, as the revelation 
of an exceptionally attractive personality it is 
interesting and stimulating throughout. 

The school that made morality nothing more 
than a divine fiat, apprehended by a faculty 
working as independently of the emotional life 
and of experience as the so-called mathematical 
faculty appears to work, has long been con- 
fronted by a rival sect that looks upon the 
moral code as a system of rules for the attain- 
ment of the best collective and individual life. 
Its psychology has often been crude and frag- 
mentary. Even as late as the middle of the 
nineteenth century, therefore, the most it had 
accomplished was to show the intimacy of the 
relation between human happiness and right 
conduct. The conflict dragged on, like many 
of its kind, because each party was able to 
explain about half the observable facts, when 
the second or naturalistic theory received a 
great impetus from the promulgation and rapid 
acceptance of the theory of Evolution. It is 
probable, however, that supernaturalistic ethics 
would have been more successful in maintain- 
ing its position had it not been for the appear-

ance of a new class of moralists. These were 
men whose devotion to their subject was based 
not merely upon its usefulness for practice, or 
its availability as a quarry for metaphysics, 
but also upon their interest in it for its own 
sake. Pledged in advance to no particular 
conclusions, approaching the subject with no 
particular bias except that which is the life of 
every science, the expectation that all phenom- 
ena will turn out to have a natural — i. e., a 
non-miraculous — explanation, they have been 
largely successful in getting the points of view 
of both parties to the old controversies and in 
building up a theory true to all the experience 
from which the contending factions drew their 
life. 

Of this movement the recent text-books of 
Professor Thilly and Professor Mezes are rep- 
resentative examples. Within a comparatively 
narrow compass. Professor Thilly has given a 
very readable, and in the main clear and accu- 
rate, picture of present-day ethical investiga- 
tion, its tendencies and conclusions. There 
are chapters on conscience — i.e., the nature 
of the emotions of approbation and obligation, 
their source and history; on the criterion by 
which conscience distinguishes between right 
and wrong ; on the nature of welfare, or the 
honum; and on the kind of freedom involved 
in moral responsibility. Each of these subjects 
is discussed first with reference to the history 
of doctrine, then systematically. In the former 
division. Professor Thilly unfortunately prefers 
to supply a large number of very short sketches, 
instead of using his space for a more detailed 
presentation of a few typical theories. But 
this defect could easily be remedied by a good 
teacher. 

Professor Mezes's " Ethics, Descriptive and 
Explanatory" is hardly a text-book of the con- 
ventional type. It passes over in haste or 
omits entirely many topics in which the under- 
graduate is much interested, and confines itself 
in the main to the detailed discussion of such 
subjects as the nature of the moral judgment, 
what can be said of its origin and growth and 
its relation to the other mental processes? 
what kinds of action arouse the moral judg- 
ment? and finally, what actions are judged right 
and what wrong? In working out the solution 
of these problems, a wide range of literature 
has been utilized, the influence of Professor 
Clifford and Professor Sidgwick being most 
pervasive. But the author has done something 
more than make a copy out of the authorities ; 
at almost every turn he has added material of 



his own, so that the book stands as an original 
contribution to ethics, on the whole the best 
and most noteworthy that has come from this 
generation of American moralists. 

Professor Mezes indicates with clearness the 
points in which modern naturalism meets the 
older metaphysical theories of ethics. He 
shows why we are able, under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, to decide off-hand what is right in 
a given case. He explains in part how char- 
acter can have both an intrinsic and extrinsic 
value. Finally, he points out the actual place 
of the will of God in ethical theory. If it be 
true that morality is a system of rules for the 
attainment of human welfare, if it be admitted, 
furthermore, that the fundamental reality of 
the universe is a personal being possessed of 
holiness and love, it will follow that He will 
care supremely for perfection of character in 
His children ; and that to believe in His exist- 
ence is to believe that He demands such per- 
fection of us. It is just this sense of a demand 
from above that is the essential feature in the 
supernaturalistic theories of obligation. The 
relation of metaphysics to ethics on such a view 
as the above is admirably stated by the author. 
Morality certainly has a significance for this 
world of ours ; it may also have a cosmic sig- 
nificance. But in order to discover anything 
about the latter, we must understand the moral 
life that is being lived here and now before 
our eyes. Therefore a metaphysics of ethics 
can build only on a foundation of data supplied 
by those whose immediate aim is merely to 
give a description and a " natural " explana- 
tion of the facts of the moral consciousness. 
Frank Chapman Sharp. 



If ever plain men wrought out an epic in pursuit 
of duty, this was done by Meriwether Lewis and 
William Clark when they reached the head-waters 
of the Missouri and passed down the Columbia to 
the Pacific Ocean in the years 1804-1806. The 
epical character of the expedition has been well 
preserved in the volume on these worthies which 
Mr. William R. Lighton has added to the " River- 
side Biographical Series " (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) . 
The story is one with which every American child 
should be familiar. Wisely enough, Mr. Lighton 
has permitted the two great explorers to tell their 
own tale through Captain Clark's happily preserved 
journal, though he fails to set forth the effect of this 
journey upon our magnificent continental empire. 
But the hardships uncomplainingly endured, not by 
the commanders alone but by every member of their 
party, afford a monument to American manhood 
not likely to be exceeded in the years to come.

Some New I^atube Books.* 



An increasing pleaaare is being added to the en- 
joyment of modern books by the artistic features 
with which they are generously embellished. An 
instance in point is famished by the treatise on 
"Oar Ferns in their Haunts," by Mr. "Willard 
Nelson Clute. It is a mere text-book by first inten- 
tion, a manual to be subject to the wear-and-tear of 
every-day use ; and yet it is a dainty work of art, 
delighting the eye with the uniform beauty of its 
external features. Pictures appeal to us more 
quickly than print, and with these the work is lav- 
ishly adorned. There are eight exquisite colored 
plates, with a multitude of full-page and minor 
illustrations in black and white, executed with ad- 
mirable truth and delicacy. The text, when we 
turn to it. is equally satisfying. It exhibits a mas- 
terly command of the subject. Every species of 
fern known as a native of North America, from 
the Gulf States to the eastern slope of the Rocky 
Mountains, is described with a fulness that leaves 
nothing to be desired, and with a literary charm 
that is enticing. " If it be required," said Thorean, 
"' to know the position of the fruit-dots or the char- 
acter of the indusium, nothing could be easier than 
to ascertain it ; but if it is required that you be 
affected by ferns, that they amount to anything, 
signify anything to you, that they be another sacred 
scripture and revelation to you, helping to redeem 
your life, this end is not so easily accomplished." 
Mr. Clute has done what man may to kindle an 
enthusiasm for the ferns, the most graceful forms 
of pure leafage the earth produces ; and he has

Mr. Almond Dexter built him a summer home 
on an island in Insley lake, which, in a mountainous 
region of Maine, is famous for the sport it yields in 
trout-fishing. How he accomplished the enterprise 
of turning into a civilized estate a tract of wild and 
dense forest-land, two miles from the main shore 
and twenty miles from a railroad, is related in his 
book entitled " And the "Wilderness Blossomed." 
He would surround himself with all the comforts 
and luxuries of refined life ; he would have a spa- 
cious and picturesque dwelling, ample pleasure 
grounds, and kitchen and flower gardens, — though 
to carry out his purpose he must rely upon the 
services of unskilled men, backwoodsmen in fact, 
whose main business was to act as guides and pack- 
ers for the strangers who people the country in the 
leisure season. Mr. Dexter found these rude " men 
of Maine" equal to every requirement, and no plans 
depending upon them failed of fulfilment. He de- 
votes one chapter of his book to their peculiar traits 
and capacities. Another is filled with discourse 
pertaining to his library and the books that prop- 
erly furnish a country house. A third deals with the 
birds in the vicinity, and the remainder is occupied 
with his experiences in the culture of flowers and 
vegetables. The writer adheres closely to the ex- 
ternal aspects of his topics, offering no reflections 
savoring of sentiment or of a philosophical disposi- 
tion. He is everywhere the man of affairs, ener- 
getic and effective with the business in hand. His 
book is handsome in every detail and furnished 
with appropriate illustrations. 

The sketches which have been brought together 
in a volume entitled '• Nature Biographies," by Mr. 
Clarence Moores Weed, have the charm with which 
such work can be invested by the sympathetic ob- 
server and skilful writer. Each of the fourteen 
separate articles treats of a special member of the 
insect tribe. In one we have a story of " The 
Making of a Butterfly," of its passage through the 
several stages from the egg to the imago. In others 
there are histories of tent-caterpillars, walking-sticks, 
locust mummies, potter-wasps, grasshoppers, para- 
sitic insects, and some of the commoner moths and 
butterflies. The chance reader, knowing and car- 
ing nothing for the creeping and flying things pic- 
tured with pen and burin in these pages, will soon 
find himself interested in the descriptions of Mr. 
"Weed, who quickly proves that no living creatures 
have more curious and interesting habits and fac- 
ulties than those of which he writes. The copious 
illustrations are photographed from life by the 
author. 

An edition in colors of the excellent treatise on 
" Insect Life," by Mr. John Henry Comstock, com- 
mends this work anew to the consideration of the 
public. It is prepared for the needs of teachers 
and students who would pursue a thorough course 
in the science of entomology. The writer has had 
large experience as an instructor in his specialty in

Cornell and Stanford Universities, and understands 
the necessity of presenting his subject in an at- 
tractive as well as systematic manner. The volume 
opens vt^ith lessons in the structure, metamorphoses, 
and classification of insects and their near relatives, 
and in the varied forms that abound in still and 
running water, in the orchard, the forest, and by 
the roadside. Part second is taken up with direc- 
tions for the collection and preservation of speci- 
mens. Eighteen colored plates, with a multitude 
of wood engravings, give completeness to the de- 
scriptive letter-press. 

"The First Book of Birds," by Mrs. Olive 
Thome Miller, which has enjoyed a deserved pop- 
ularity, is now followed by " The Second Book of 
Birds," of merit similar to that of its predecessor. 
The supplementary volume leads the reader a step 
onward in the study of the feathered races, by 
showing how they are divided into families, and 
what are the prominent characteristics which unite 
them in these distinctive groups. One or more of 
the species common in the United States are selected 
as representatives of each family, and described 
in language suited to young persons. For many 
years Mrs. Miller has spent her summers in the 
field watching the birds with an intelligent and 
patient eye. The mass of facts thus obtained has 
been augmented by diligent gleanings from the 
books, until she now maintains an estimable place 
among American ornithologists. She is as honest 
in her statements as in her investigations, and both 
carry the weight of authority. This latest of her 
publications will be found useful, not only to the 
beginner, but to the advanced student in ornithology, 
because of the interesting incidents regarding bird- 
life which have rewarded her personal notice or 
have been witnessed by trustworthy observers. The 
book is enriched by a profusion of full-i)age plates 
from designs by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, eight of 
them being colored. 

A favor to bird students is offered in the re- 
production of Mr. Frank M. Chapman's '< Bird- 
Life " with illustrations in colors, at a greatly re- 
duced price. Without pictures, the book is richly 
worth its cost ; and with them it is a treasure in- 
deed. The portraits are after drawings by Mr. 
Ernest Seton-Thompson, whom everybody knows 
as a remarkably spirited delineator of the form and 
attitude of " our little brothers of the air." In this 
edition they are clothed with colors and so are true 
to the very life. Seventy-five full-page plates are 
interspersed through the text, giving it the value 
of veritable object-lessons. Of the text it is su- 
perfluous now to speak. It is crammed with in- 
formation of a valuable sort not easily obtained 
elsewhere, and here presented in compact and per- 
spicuous order. 

What is there of promise in a boy who idles away 
all the time he can steal from home and books and 
healthful play, to sit like a stock or a stone for hours 
together watching the strange ways of the frogs and 
the ducks, the otter and the muskquash, that haunt 



the brook or the lake and hide their life from all but 
the most patient of prying eyes; or who wanders 
through the woods and remote by-places to come 
silently upon the wild folk dwelling there and win 
them to friendly confidence or startle them into a 
betrayal of their best-kept secrets? What profit is 
there in a man who spends weeks of winter and 
summer in the heart of the wilderness, alone with 
his rod and gun, an Indian guide at hand for camp- 
service and timely help at need, but living under a 
separate roof, while the hunter paddles his bark 
canoe on solitary waters or travels on snow-shoes 
weary miles in the track of the moose, the deer, 
and the caribou ? Open one of the little books that 
have been recently produced by Mr. William J. 
Long, and you will find a gracious answer to these 
questions. There are three of these books, cheap 
in price and unpretentious, yet neat and attractive 
in every detail. First comes '' Ways of Wood 
Folk," then " Wilderness Ways," and lastly " Se- 
crets of the Woods." More charming entertain- 
ment for readers of varied tastes has seldom been 
provided within book covers. 

The author has made wonderful use of his op- 
portunities for nature study. One would suppose 
from his intimate knowledge of birds and beasts 
that his whole time must have been given to a study 
of them. But he is college-bred ; this we learn from 
indirect statements. That he is a man of fine cul- 
ture, his style attests. It is flowing, graceful, and 
well suited to convey the stores of curious informa- 
tion with which his books abound. The following, 
from the story of "Chigwooltz the Frog," whom by 
quiet coaxing Mr. Long had won to a genuine at- 
tachment, is a good example : 

" One day, to try the effects of nicotine on a new 
subject, I took a bit of Simmo's black tobacco and 
gave it to Chigwooltz. He ate it thankfully, as he did 
everything else I gave him. In a little while he grew 
uneasy, sitting up and rubbing his belly with his fore 
paws. Presently he brought his stomach up into his 
mouth, turned it inside out to get rid of the tobacco, 
washed it thoroughly iu the lake, swallowed it down 
again, and was ready for his bread and beef. . . . 

" Chigwooltz, unlike many of my pets, was not in the 
least dependent on my bounty. Indeed, he was a re- 
markable hunter on his own account, and what he took 
from me he took as hospitality, not charity. One morn- 
ing he came to me with the tail of a small trout sticking 
out of his mouth. The rest of the fish was below, be- 
ing digested. Another day, towards twilight, I saw him 
resting on the lily pads, looking very full, with a sus- 
picious looking object curling out over his under lip. I 
wiggled my finger in the water, and he came from pure 
sociability, for he was beyond eating any more. The 
suspicious-looking object proved to be a bird's foot, and 
beside it was a pointed wing-tip. That was too much 
for my curiosity. I opened his mouth and pulled out 
the bird with some difficulty, for Chigwooltz bad been 
engaged some time in the act of swallowing and had it 
well down. It proved to be a full-grown male swallow, 
without a mark anywhere to show how he had come by 
his death. Chigwooltz looked at me reproachfully, but 
swallowed his game promptly the moment I had fin- 
ished examining it." 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



187 



Mr. Long surprised Chigwooltz one day in the 
very act of trapping a tree-sparrow. The bird 
was taking a morning bath, when Chigwooltz dis- 
covered him. He stole cautiously from the lily pads, 
" Nearer and nearer, sinking himself till only his eyes 
showed above water. The ripple that flowed away on 
either side was gentle as that of a floating leaf. Then, 
just as the bird had sipped and lifted himself for a last 
swallow, Chigwooltz hurled himself out of water. One 
snap of his big mouth and the sparrow was done for. 
An hour later, when I came down to my canoe, he was 
sitting low on the lily pads, winking sleepily now and 
then, with eight little sparrow's toes curling over the 
rim of his under lip, like a hornpont's whiskers." 

The books are filled with similar histories of Mr. 
Long's friendship with the timid and wary beings 
in fur and feathers, and smooth and shelly integu- 
ments, of which the world of men knows all too 
little. Much has been made of Thoreau's intimacy 
with wild animals, but his experience pales in com- 
parison with that related by Mr. Long. "With as 
keen a fondness for nature as Thoreau possessed, 
this later investigator has a tenderer feeling for his 
own and for inferior races, which gains our regard 
as it does that of the secluded, suspicious tenants 
of the wilderness. He stops and studies until he 
understands them, and they respond trustfully to 
his tactful sympathy. He has pathetic interviews 
with a veteran deer whom he rescued from a cruel 
death from a pack of blood-thirsty hounds ; he 
strokes the neck of a fierce bald eagle, and sits 
calmly by his nest on a cli£f to which he had climbed 
three hundred feet above the spruce tops of the level 
wilderness, while the male and female take their 
bold stand within ten feet and look him in the eye 
with mingled courage and anxiety ; he made friends 
with Killoleet — "Little Sweet Voice" — as the 
Indians call the white-throated sparrow, one of the 
most enticing and unapproachable of our wild birds. 
Killoleet slept on the ridge-pole of the tent, and 
was ever there to welcome his benefactor when he 
returned from his tramps, and to eat the crumbs 
that were bountifully scattered for him. Killoleet 
had a nest in the dark underbrush bard by, and 
we are glad, as Mr. Long was afterwards, that he 
"Never saw that nest, though it was scarcely ten yards 
from my tent, until after the young had flown, and 
Killoleet cared no more about it. I knew the bush in 
which it was, close by the deer path; could pick oat 
from my fireplace the thick branch that sheltered it; 
for I often watched the birds coming and going. I 
have no doubt that Killoleet would have welcomed me 
there without fear; but his mate never laid aside her 
shyness about it, never went to it directly when I was 
looking, and I knew he would like me better if I re- 
spected her little secret." 

It was his delicate consideration for their sacred 
rights which put the author on easy footing with 
his comrades in the vast solitude. He fed and pro- 
tected them, and they were free in his presence 
almost as when alone. It was human-like, it was 
bird- like, for Killoleet to greet him with a song 
when he pitched his tent in the same spot a second 



summer, and to come down and eat erambs from 
his plate as he had done before. 

It is a service to the public to present books of 
such high quality in such inexpensive form as these. 
They are educational in a high sense ; and it is a 
pleasure to know that more of them may be looked 
for from the same genial hand.

Sixteen years ago the American and 

sLiZ'mL ?"t'«»^ ^^J«°^ Companies joinUy 
issued the Revised Version of the 
Bible. They did not agree on all the changes that 
should be made in the King James Version of 1611 ; 
consequently the British Committee inserted in ap- 
pendices such preferences of the American Com- 
mittee as they deemed wise. At the same time they 
required this American Committee to enter into an 
agreement not to issue or sanction an issue of the 
Revised Version within fourteen years. The Amer- 
ican Committee kept its promise, and perpetuated 
its organization. During these past sixteen years, 
the able-bodied members have steadily labored to 
perfect their work. Unhampered by any British 
Committee, they have not only incorporated their 
preferences into the text, but have in many other 
ways improved the Revised Version of 1881-1885, 
80 as the better to adapt it to the needs of the 
American reading public. The result of their stu- 
pendous labor is now published under the title, 
" The Revised Version ; the American Standard 
Edition," by Messrs. Thomas Nelson & Sons of 
New York. The form of the book is a good inno- 
vation in Bible-making. It is 8^ inches by 6|^ inches, 
printed in long-primer type, double-column page, 
with scriptural references in single column between 
the reading columns, and variant readings on the 
two margins. At the top of each page, in black- 
faced type, is a summary of the contents on that 
page. A closer examination shows that the matter 
has been re-paragraphed and re-punctuated — most 
acceptable improvements. The substitution of 
"Jehovah" for "the Lord" and "God"; of 
" who " and " that " for "which," when referring 
to persons ; of " are " for "be " ih indicative clauses ; 
the omission of " for " before infinitives, and the 
change of " an " to "a " before " h " aspirated, are 
changes which every reader of the Bible will in- 
stantly approve of. Archaic words — altogether 
too numerous in the Revised Version — are dis- 
placed by their modern equivalents, as, " chapiter " 
by "capital," "astonied" by "astonished," " heath- 
en" by "nations," "minish" by "diminish," 
" reins " by " heart," " hardly bestead " by " sore 
distressed," and scores of others. There is also a 
vast improvement in the proper use of "shall" and 
"will." Another feature of this Bible which 
greatly enhances its value is the new set of Script-

ural and marginal references, which really refer to 
passages of value in understanding the text in ques- 
tion. All these and other improvenaents easily give 
this version the first place among the English trans- 
lations of the Bible. In mechanical make-up, in 
literary form, and in faithfulness to every interest 
involved, this American Standard Revised Bible is 

facile princeps. 

More than ordinary interest attaches 
to the life of the Rev. Isaac Thomas 
Hecker, as told by Mr. Henry D. 
Sedgwick, Jr., for the " Beacon Biographies " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.). Father Hecker was one 
of the few men who went from practical Amer- 
ican life and Protestant rearing to the mystic side 
of Roman Catholicism, just as he is one of the 
few Americans who have given the Church of Rome 
another instrument for the promulgation of her 
doctrines through his establishment of the mission- 
ary order of Paulist Fathers. Born in New York 
City on December 18, 1819, a member of the com- 
munity at Brook Farm from January to June, 1843, 
Hecker was baptized a Roman Catholic on August 
1, 1844. Two years later he sailed from his native 
land to make his novitiate with the Redemptorists, 
to which order he was duly admitted in 1846, being 
priested by Cardinal Wiseman in London three 
years later. After a life of great usefulness in the 
United States, he was expelled from the Congrega- 
tion of the Most Holy Redeemer in 1857, by a 
decree the effect of which was virtually abrogated 
by the papal permission to establish the order of the 
Missionary Priests of St. Paul the Apostle. An 
earlier experience had taught Father Hecker the 
value of journalism in the spreading of opinion, 
religious or secular, and he founded the "Catholic 
World" in 1865 and the "Young Catholic" in 
1870, in pursuance of his ideas. He died on De- 
cember 22, 1888, in New York City, deeply regretted 
by many thousands of his countrymen who had 
learned to know and love him through his preach- 
ings and writings. Mr. Sedgwick tells the story of 
this saintly life with simplicity and candor, and 
makes it a worthy addition to the admirable series 
of biographies of American leaders in thought and 
action. 

In the delightful series of hand- 
books bearing the Dent-Macmillan 
imprint, and devoted to mediaeval 
towns, the latest and certainly one of the most 
charming is that which tells the story of Bruges. 
Mr. E. Gilliat-Smith, the author, is in every true 
sense at home in his subject. He has lived many 
years in the quaint old Flemish city, " the fairest 
of the North," and is fairly saturated with the lore 
of her thousand years of civic life. Back to the 
days of Baldwin of the Iron Hand, the first Count 
of Flanders, Mr. Gilliat-Smith takes his readers; 
and then, with swift, unwavering fingers, he turns 
for them the blood-stained pages where tyranny 
and treachery, freedom and loyalty, Fleming and

Frenchman, have left their red record. Belgium's 
claim to be the " battle-ground of Europe " receives 
fresh and full vindication in this stirring recital, 
which occupies twenty-two of the twenty-five chap- 
ters. Then follows an appreciative survey of the 
architecture of Bruges in its " bloom-time," the 
fifteenth century, when so many picturesque struc- 
tures were either begun or received their final 
glories. The great Belfry, the H6tel de Ville, the 
Cathedral and a score of other churches, the guilds' 
halls and chapels, were the salient landmarks ; but 
'* even working men, humble members of the great 
guilds of smiths, or masons, or carpenters, were 
making their homes beautiful with the fruit of their 
handicraft ; constructing canopied niches at street 
corners, or over the doorways of the hovels in which 
they lived, and placing in them graven images of 
Our Lady or of some favorite saint; hammering 
out exquisite lanterns, which it was their delight to 
hang before them, from brackets of no less dainty 
fashion ; fabricating, of wrought iron, those quaintly 
beautiful trade signs by which it was their wont to 
call attention to their avocations ; making door, and 
lintel, and chimney, and rafter comely with fruit 
and foliage, fascinating with heraldic devices, and 
grotesque and leering heads, and the images of 
devils and saints." The painters too, who are no 
small part of the glory of Bruges, are given a chap- 
ter : the van Eycks, Gerard David, Roger van der 
Weyden, and Hans Memling are appreciatively 
described and some of their most famous pictures 
reproduced. Of all these things Mr. Gilliat-Smith 
writes alertly and enthusiastically, though not with- 
out some looseness and repetition. The book's at- 
tractiveness and usefulness are at least doubled by 
the felicitous illustrations, some sixty in number, 
contributed by Miss Edith Calvert and Mr. Herbert 
Railton. Quite in the Pennell style, and varying 
in size from thumb-nail to full-page, they have left 
no monument unrepresented, and complete the 
value of a handbook which must share or dispute 
the place of Baedeker in the side-pocket of the 
tourist's jacket. 

In "Pleasures of the Telescope" 
(Appleton) Mr. Garrett P. Serviss 
has written a book that is not des- 
tined to a popularity so immediate as that which 
followed his earlier " Astronomy Through an 
Opera-Glass," the value of its contents depending 
on the possession of an optical instrument of con- 
siderable value, and one not to be found in the 
ordinary household. After learning all that can be 
learned with the customary opera-glass, the telescope 
follows as a matter of course, if the interest in as- 
tronomy is to extend beyond that accorded a mere 
pastime. Here it is that Mr. Serviss's really nota- 
ble abilities as a popular writer come into play. 
Though the person willing to comply with the sim- 
ple instructions given in these compendious pages 
will find himself with something more than a smat- 
tering of one of the grandest of the exact sciences

at the end of his reading, it will have been acquired 
with an ease that entitles the work to praise as 
affording almost a royal road to learning. The 
illustrations and diagrams are numerous and valu- 
able, the text easily grasped and suflBciently exten- 
sive, and the whole admirably designed for both 
recreation and instruction. — Of quite another sort 
is Professor A. W. Bickerton's " Romance of 
the Heavens" (Macmillan). The entire book is 
devoted to a demonstration, in language as little 
technical as possible, of the truth of the writer's 
theory that variable stars, spiral nebulae, and a 
number of similar celestial phenomena, are due to 
a grazing contact in mid-space of roaming suns or 
other bodies of similar nature. The text is closely 
reasoned ; all the latest discoveries of physics and 
chemistry are drawn upon, and the whole culminates 
in the postulation of renovation and immortality in 
the material universe.

ttncM and CllXti. ■> n- • mi -ri 

Towns and Cities ; or. The Practi- 
cal Basis of Civic ^Esthetics" (Putnam) is offered 
as an aid to the development of civic consciousness. 
It takes up the general question of beautifying 
American cities by whatever means, and deals with 
the broad field of effort manifested in Italy, France, 
and Teutonic Europe, drawing conclusions from the 
older civilizations which are likely to benefit our 
own. Within comparatively small compass the 
work now in progress in American cities, for the 
most part by bodies outside of the municipal gov- 
ernments, is detailed ; while the economic advan- 
tages to flow from an increase in the beauty of every 
citizen's surroundings are also set forth with con- 
vincing particularity. Beginning with city sites 
and street plans, the author passes through such 
topics as " Beauty in the Street " and " The Adver- 
tisement Problem " to considerations of the aesthetic 
phases of social, philanthropic, and educational 
effort, and concludes with two chapters of practical 
advice concerning the beautification of our cities, 
whether by individuals and voluntary associations 
or by the oflBcials. It is to be regretted that Mr. 
Robinson has not familiarized himself with the work 
to this end already accomplished in the States of 
South America, where a round score of cities far 
surpassing anything north of Mexico are flourishing 
amain. The contemplation of the practical work 
actually done by our half-despised fellow-republicans 
might shame us into decency in this regard — a 
most desirable consummation, even if attained 
through the sacrifice of a little of our national igno- 
rance and conceit.

The fact that the subjects of the 
Tsar have a duty toward their ex- 
panding frontier not dissimilar to 
that of Americans toward their vanishing boundary 
on the western plains, and the growing realization 
of the fact in this country, may justify the reader 



in seeking Mr. Francis H. E. Palmer's " Russian 
Life in Town and Country " (Putnam) for infor- 
mation not to be found in any similar work. How- 
ever remote the Russian noble may seem to be 
during his winter life in one or another of the great 
cities of the empire, Mr. Palmer shows us how inti- 
mately blended with the soil he is during the summer 
time. All Russian estates are based upon tillage 
during the short, fierce season when the sun coaxes 
into being the uncertain crops. Whether the season 
is good or bad determines the amount and charac- 
ter of the winter's pleasure, and the margin of profit 
is too small to permit the delegation of supervision 
to another. The pictures drawn by the author of 
the homely patriarchial life which is the lot of 
every Russian of old descent and fortune for a part 
of his year is not an alluring one, though enlivened 
with glimpses of the frailties and humors of a simple 
folk only recently out of slavery and not yet famil- 
iar with their changed economic status. In addi- 
tion, Mr. Palmer discusses the more important 
questions arising out of the social conditions of 
Russian life, the Church and the dissenters, the 
Jews and the commercial and mechanical monop- 
olies they secure, " Education and the Army," and 
many more. No more informing book, nor one 
admitting its readers to more intimate acquaintance 
with the realities of Russian life, has been pub- 
lished of late years. 

A book of mingled essays and bits of 
hpv^ipt^" fiction has been written by « Violet 

Fane " (Lady Currie), with the title 
of " Two Moods of a Man, with Other Papers and 
Short Stories" (imported by Charles Scribner's 
Sons). Three or four of the sections of the book 
are fiction of the slightest sort, several are of inter- 
est to lovers of books, and one deals with the same 
"Jem," the Turkish "young pretender," whose 
life was told so much better by the late Eugene 
Schuyler ; yet all have a certain literary value and 
grace of style. The most ambitious of the stories 
is called " A Romance of Kensington Gardens," in 
which the heroine is a noblewoman whose years 
have outstripped but not extinguished her love for 
adventure, leading her to pose in the most amusing 
manner before a distinguished-looking stranger, 
whom later she is chagrined to learn is totally 
blind, and nothing more than a "Klondike million- 
aire " at that. The concluding paper, on " The 
Ideal Country House," is one of the most interest- 
ing in the book, being written with full knowledge 
and lively understanding. 

The recent anniversary celebration 
of John Marshall's selection to be 
Chief Justice of the United States 
adds to the value of the life of that distinguished 
jurist now prepared for the '• Riverside Biogjraph- 
ical Series" (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) by Mr.

upon a paper read at Cambridge, Mass., last Feb-

ruary, for his material. Mr. Thayer is entirely 
sympathetic with Marshall's methods and char- 
acter, according to him with enthusiastic apprecia- 
tion the distinction of having set the judiciary above 
both the legislative and executive branches of the 
government, and of having left the American people 
content with this interpretation of their Constitu- 
tion. In a work so limited in size it was hardly to 
be expected that the pleas of Marshall's adversaries, 
few as they are at this day, should be considered, 
and Mr. Thayer has probably done better by con- 
tenting himself with showing why the American 
people permitted the establishment of a practice at 
variance with that of all other civilized nations of 
the globe, his argument from our colonial history 
being cogent and succinct. Recent decisions, like 
that in the income-tax case and the cases growing 
out of the Porto E.ican annexation, have not added 
to the complacency with which many Americans 
regard the powers conferred by Marshall's genius 
on the Supreme Court, for all that. It is signifi- 
cant that the manner of Marshall's appointment is 
not even hinted at in this book. 



Pioneer towns

In addition to literary duties which 
would break down a less industrious 
man, Mr. James Otis has undertaken 
the preparation of a number of small volumes for a 
series to be called " The Pioneer Towns of Amer- 
ica," those of the State of Maine falling. to his share. 
The first of these, " The Story of Old Falmouth " 
(Crowell), has just been issued, and is a pleasantly 
discursive history of an interesting spot. If the 
series is made sufficiently inclusive, — and the 
amount of available material is immense, — taking 
in all parts of the country, there should be no doubt 
of its success. Few American towns worthy the 
name, east or west, north or south, are without 
pioneer traditions. 



Notes. 



Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles's " Golden Treasury 
of American Lyrics " (Page) is reissued in a neat " pop- 
ular edition," in a mechanical form similar to that of its 
English namesake. 

We learn that the whole edition of the Oxford 
University Press collotype facsimile of the First Folio 
Shakespeare, referred to in our last issue, was sub- 
scribed for within six weeks of the issue of the pre- 
liminary prospectus. 

A contemporary account of the battle of Lexington, 
by the Rev. Jonas Clarke, being an appendix to a ser- 
mon delivered on the very day of the conflict, provides 
the contents of a very interesting pamphlet just issued 
by the Lexington Historical Society. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. are the publishers of 
" A Brief Topical Survey of United States History," 
by Messrs. Oliver P. Cornman and Oscar Gerson, This 
is a text-book intended for use, not as a substitute for 
the standard works, but rather as a supplementary aid 
to the teacher in the work of review. It is distinctly a 
book for study and not for reading, and is admirably 



fitted for its purpose. Among the topics summarized 
are " Discoveries and Explorations," " Troubles with 
Foreign Countries," " Financial History," " History of 
Political Parties," and the " Growth of American Lit- 
erature." 

Lorimer Stoddard, the only son of Mr. Richard Henry 
Stoddard, died at Sag Harbor, N. Y., on the last day of 
August, at the age of forty. He was a successful actor 
and dramatist, being the author of the stage version of 
" Tess of the D'Urbervilles " and other familiar plays. 

Mr. John R. Effinger, Jr., instructor in French in 
the University of Michigan, has just edited in one vol- 
ume the "Preface de Cromwell "and " Hernani " of 
Victor Hugo (Scott, Foresman & Co.), with an histor-

American collectors will do well to have. 

An elaborate folio edition of Shakespeare will be 
issued this Fall by Messrs. Frederick A. Stokes Co., 
under the editorship of Mr. W. E. Henley. The

ten volumes. The edition is limited to 360 sets for 
America.

Alice Emerson, is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. Its 
chief features are a cumulative method of treatment 
and the placing of a constant emphasis upon the pupil's 
own thinking and writing. It is a book of generous 
dimensions and tasteful typography. 

We have just received Volumes VII. and VIII. con- 
taining " Middlemarch," in " The Personal Edition of 
George Eliot," published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co. This edition is specialized from its many com- 
petitors by the introductions that Mrs. Wood has writ- 
ten for each of the novels, and by the many pictures of 
places made familiar by the novelist's pen. 

Two French texts are among the recent publications 
of the American Book Co. " L'Enfant Espion," edited 
by Mr. Reginald R. Goodell, is a volume of eight short 
stories by Daudet, Coppde, Maupassant, and M^rim^e — 
two from each author. •' La Neuvaine de Colette," 
by Mile. Jeanne Schultz, is a story that needs no intro- 
duction to the public. It is edited by Miss Florence 
I. C. Lye. 

Evelyn Abbott, Jowett lecturer in Greek history at 
Oxford, and author of various works on Greek history 
and literature, died in London a few days ago. His 
literary output included a three- volume history of 
Greece, a study of Pericles, and a collection of essays 
entitled " Hellenica." He was also joint author, with 
Prof. Lewis Campbell, of the " Life and Letters of Ben- 
jamin Jowett." 

Among the more important Autumn announcements 
of Mr. T. Fisher Unwin of London, we note an edition 
de luxe of the " Mermaid Series " of plays by the old 
dramatists, the collected poems of Miss Mary Robin- 
son, Prof. Pasquale Villari's " The Barbarian Invasion 
of Italy," Mr. Albert Chevalier's autobiography " Be- 
fore I Forget," and a new Haymarket play by Mrs. 
Craigie ("John Oliver Hobbes ").

Announcements of Fal-l. Books. 



Again The Dial's list of books announced for Fall 
publication sbows an advance over auv season in the 
history of the American book trade, — the number of 
titles this year being nearly 1800 ; as against 1700, the 
highest number of any previous year. With the increase 
in population there is an increase in the number of 
book - readers ; and the demand for books grows, 
besides, with the growth of the reading habit as the 
country advances in intelligence and prosperity. 

The list here given is prepared entirely from advance 
information secured especially for this purpose, and 
represents the output of about 75 publishing firms. 
All the books entered are presumably new books — new 
editions not being included unless having new form 
or matter; and, with a few necessary exceptions, the 
list does not include Fall books already issued and 
entered in our regular List of New Books. Juvenile 
books are, from their great number, deferred to another 
issue, — although reckoned with in the above eoum- 
eratiou. 

The more important literary features of the list are 
commented upon in the leadiug editorial in the present 
issue.

Tbe author's fame as a Preacher and Lecturer is a guarantee of the literary excellence of the book,

"The Dial" has always stood for character. It has 
the old Paritan conscience on which everything that is 
lasting in oar country is built. It is sane, wise, trnthful ; 
it is honest, hopefal, and kindly, and with all this it is the 
best joamal of literary criti- 
cism which we have, and we 
ask no better.

"The Dial" seems at present the most unbiased, 
good humored, and sensible organ of American 
criOcism. —BARRETT WENDELL 

in " Literary History of America." 



The good sense, the sound critical judgment, the liberal 
spirit, the hieh principles of "The Dial," all maintained 
with simplicity, steadiness, and without pretension, have 
secured the respect as well as the cordial regard of its 
readers.

"The Crown of Thorns " is a story of the time of Christ. It is 
fiction of the character of legend, utilizing materials preserved in both 
the canonical scriptures and the Apocryphal traditions, but giving 
preference to the former. The hopes and beliefs of the main person- 
alities, however, can throughout be verified by documentary evidence. 
The religious milieu is strictly historical, and is designed to show the way 
in which Christianity developed from Judaism through the Messianic 
hopes of the Nazarenes as interpreted by the Apostle Paul of Tarsus.

r/f£ GREAT NOVEL 



The right of WAY 



BY 

GILBERT PARKER 

Author of " The Seats of the Mighty " and " The Battle of the Strong " 

The New York Times Saturday Review says: 

" The plot is dramatic. * Things happen ' right along from the first page 
to the last, . . . We are left with the mental image of a vivid, dramatic pic- 
ture, painted in a masterly fashion. Mr. Parker is an artist, and lie is to be 
thanked for a story of unusual freshness, power, and ' visualization. ' " 

The Brooklyn Eagle says: 

" Beyond all doubt an extremely powerful story. * The Right of Way ' 
is a great novel." 

The New York Tribune says: 

"Mr. Parker has never written anything quite so good as *The Right 
of Way.'"

John Fiske's Latest Book 

Life Everlasting 

By John Fiske. 16mo, $1.00 net; postpaid, $1.10. 
This book completes the remarkable group to which belong Mr. Fiske's books on The Destiny of Man, 
The Idea of God, and Through Nature to God. Its argument is on the line of Evolution, inferring from 
what man has already become by the play of the Infinite Force in whose beneficent hand he is that the 
logical next step in his progress is the attainment of life everlasting. The book is great in the grasp of 
principles and in the vastness of the future which it prophesies for humankind. 

The Marrow of Tradition 

By Charles W. Chesnutt, author of " The House Behind the Cedars," " The Conjure 
Woman," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. [October i^.] 
Upon a background of contemporary Southern life Mr. Chesnutt has written a strong, virile, and exciting 
novel. The story involves the fate of a child for whom its parents forsee a bright future, but for whom a 
superstitious old black nurse sees grave misfortunes ahead — a fancy which seems curiously borne out by an 
adverse fate. There are an interesting love story, an injury avenged with Old Testament rigor, and a 
greater wrong nobly forgiven. Among the characters are an editor who heads a reactionary political move- 
ment in a Southern state, set off against whom is an educated colored man seeking by wise methods to ele- 
vate his people. 

A MULTITUDE OF COUNSELLORS 

Being a Collection of Codes, Precepts, and Eules of Life from the Wise of All Ages. 
Edited, with an Introductory Essay on the Ancient and Modern Knowledge of Good 
and Evil, by J. N. Larned, author of " A School History of England," " History for 
Keady Reference." Large crown 8 vo, $2.00 ne^; postpaid, $2.15. lOctoherO.^ 
Mr. Larned, from his very wide range of reading, has gathered a singularly rich and varied collection 

of the maxims and condensed wisdom of sages of all times. It includes Egyptian, Greek, Roman, mediaeval, 

and modern aphorisms and proverbs, concise and pithy expressions of the world's best judgment on the 

most important matters of human life and conduct. 



The Ethnic Trinities, 

and Their Relation to the 

Christian Trinity 

By Levi Leonard Paine, D. D., Professor of 
Ecclesiastical History in the Bangor Theological 
Seminary, and author of " The Critical History 
of the Evolution of Trinitarianism." Crown 8vo, 
81.75 net; postpaid, $1.90. 

Dr. Paine here extends to the whole field of re- 
ligious thought concerning God and His relations to 
mankind, the historical survey which in his previous 
book was restricted to Christianity. The Trinita- 
rian idea is shown to be inwrought more or less in 
all world-religions, and this book traces its growth. 
It is a very significant work, a strong, fearless, rev- 
erent study of great religious questions. 



The Teachings of Dante 

By Rev. Charles A. Dinsmore. With photogra- 
vure of portrait of Dante by D. G. Rossetti, and 
a reproduction of the " Figura Universale." 
Crown 8vo, $1.50 net; postpaid, $1.65. 
Mr. Dinsmore has long been a student of Dante, 
and here approaches him from the modern religious 
point of view. He finds in Dante a corrective to 
some present tendencies in religious thought and a 
source of permanent inspiration to faith. 

Footing it in Franconia

ELLEN 

Or, The Whisperings of an 
Old Pine. 

A Philosophical Novel 
By JOSEPH BATTELL. 



This book demonstrates through the great principle 
of the universality of natural laws, the principle upon 
which all science rests, that the Darwinian theory of 
evolution and all undulatory theories are alike absurd 
and impossible. It follows that the same is true of all 
materialistic conceptions of existence, i. e., of any con- 
ceptions of existance which do not give to mind, and 
mind only, the creative power. A man, through the 
operations of his mind, can make a spade, but the spade 
cannot make a man. 

Although antagonizing some of the theories of 
science, the book is thoroughly and entirely scientific, 
placing science upon a permanently firmer, truer, and 
sounder basis. In the same direction all of the most ad- 
vanced scientific thinkers are tending, as was shown at 
the recent meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, 
^at Paris, when it was demonstrated that X-ray light is 
composed of material particles. This, of course, does 
:away with all Undulatory theories, for it would be as 
{)robable or possible for nature to have two or more 
•methods for the production of rain, or any or all phe- 
nomena, as for the production of light; besides, as the 
ibook shows, the law of creation itself must be univer- 
.-sal, and this means that every material thing is made 
by the combination of matter in its different elements 
^nd proportions. There is no possible question in re- 
:^gard to this, nor do we consider it possible that any 
•man of intelligence, when the matter is brought to his 
■attention, will seriously undertake to question it, any 
•more than he would that the sun shines. For the uni- 
versality of natural law is not an hypothesis or opinion 
"Twhich, as Socrates said, " are bad all," but a great 
truth, supported by every fact which comes within our 
knowledge. 

"A book with much ingenious construction of the most vital truths." 
— SIbnby Wattsbson, in Louisville Journal. 

"A very interesting book." — W. J. Bbtan, in The Commwier. 

"The work is not a criticism of science, but of certain theories of 
-scientists, and enlarges the sphere of human knowledge by demonstrat- 
ing the homogeneousness of physical phenomena that hitherto have 
been considered the independent results of remote and distinct causes. 
'This feature of the work marks a material advance in physical science 
hat is very auspicious for the beginning of the new century." — T. H. 
JCoLiOD, in Middlebury (Yt.) Regitter.

A WORD OF W ARNING. 

The system of publishing books at net 
prices, with a uniform discount of twenty-five 
per cent to the trade, as agreed upon last 
Spring by the American Publishers' Associa- 
tion, is now supposed to be in full operation, 
and many people who are neither publishers 
nor booksellers will be interested in learning 
how it works. It will be remembered that we 
gave our hearty approval to the plan because 
it promised to rehabilitate the old-time book- 
store, and because we believed the book-store, 
which seemed to be fast passing out of exist- 
ence except in a few of the largest cities, to be 
a civilizing agency that no community of any 
size could afford to dispense with, to be an 
institution worthy of making some sacrifice to 
preserve. Under the ruinous system of com- 
petitive prices as fixed by retailers, and of 
discriminations in favor of large purchasers as 
allowed by publishers, the bookseller, in the 
good old sense of that term, was going the way 
of the dodo and the megatherium. 

In comparing the old system with the new, 
let us take the " dollar book " as a convenient 
basis for our discussion. That book, as we all 
know, although listed at one dollar, and thus 
advertised, found few purchasers at so high a 
price. The only people who paid a dollar for 
it were those who ordered it by post from the 
publisher (in which case the latter paid the 
charges), those who lived in out-of-the-way 
places or in places where a single bookseller 
took an unwise advantage of his monopoly, 
and those who were imposed upon by unscru- 
pulous dealers in cities where the usual dis- 
count was to be had by all who asked for it. 
The true retail price of this book was eighty 
cents, thus allowing the dealer, who paid sixty 
cents or less for it, a profit of at least one-third 
of the wholesale price. 

Now under the net system, as explained with 
great care by the publishing interests that have 
been influential in securing its adoption, this 
dollar book — that is, any new book, not a 
novel, that would have been listed at one dollar 
under the old system — must be listed at 
eighty cents, and sold by the publisher to the 
bookseller for sixty cents, thus allowing the 



228 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



latter exactly the same profit as before. The 
object of the new system, as has been repeat- 
edly declared, is to eliminate the artificial 
price altogether, and make the published price 
of a book correspond to the price at which the 
book-buyer obtains it. While the system, in 
this aspect, has for its purpose to keep the 
retail price down, in its other aspect its pur- 
pose is to keep the price up to the net figure 
by refusing to supply dealers who make a 
practice of underselling. As far as the public 
has given its approval to the new system, it has 
been with the distinct understanding that both 
of these purposes should be maintained by pub- 
lishers in good faith. The refusal to supply 
dealers who are not willing to adhere to the 
list prices of books is possible only through the 
concerted action of the publishers, and such a 
combination in restraint of trade would rightly 
be viewed with suspicion were it not for the 
compensating features whereby the purchaser 
is protected from the imposition of the old 
artificial list price, and whereby the true inter- 
ests of the retail dealers are conserved. 

The word of warning which we have to 
address to publishers is this. If it should ap- 
pear that they are taking advantage of the new 
system in their own interests alone, and ignor- 
ing the interests of book-buyers, they would 
clearly be acting in bad faith toward the pub- 
lic. In other words, if their new net prices 
should turn out to be substantially the same as 
their old retail prices, thus increasing by twenty- 
five per cent the amount paid by purchasers 
for their books, the trick would soon be dis- 
covered. They are bound by every considera- 
tion of fairness not to do this, and not to 
appear to be doing it ; should they fail to 
recognize this obligation, their sympathy for 
the declining trade of the bookseller will 
quickly be recognized as so much hypocrisy, 
and as quickly resented by the public. To come 
back to our illustration of the dollar book, 
they are bound to make the published price of 
this book eighty cents ; the best way to con- 
vince the public that they are thus acting in 
good faith is to base all retail prices upon mul- 
tiples of twenty, instead of basing them upon 
multiples of twenty-five, as in the past. In 
trying to gain popular acceptance for the new 
system, the publishers have given us every 
reason to believe that they were not actuated 
by a desire for gain so much as by a desire to 
simplify the whole question of prices and dis- 
counts, and to restore the retail book trade to 
something like its earlier flourishing condition. 



It is legitimate for them to expect an indirect 
benefit from the improved conditions of book- 
selling ; it is not legitimate for them to expect 
higher prices for their books than heretofore. 
We have been examining with much inter- 
est the prices set upon publications announced 
for the present season, in order to gain some 
idea of the extent to which publishers are 
recognizing their obligations under the new 
system. The evidence that they are so recog- 
nizing these obligations is not as convincing 
as we could wish. In some cases, we find that 
practically all prices are, as heretofore, multi- 
ples of twenty-five cents ; in other cases, we 
find that some prices give evidence of the new 
system, while others do not ; in still other 
cases, we find a close approach, at least, to a 
systematic attempt at readjustment. One page 
of advertisements, for example, covering six 
announcements of a certain firm, gives us the 
following net prices: 11.80, $0.84, $1.20, 
$0.90, $1.35, and $1.10. These figures are 
a little puzzling, but they certainly indicate 
an attempt to deal fairly with the public. 
Another page yields these net prices ; $1.15, 
$3.75, $2.50, $3.00, $2.00, $1.75, and $1.00. 
If these are books that would have been priced, 
under the old system, respectively at $1.50, 
$5.00, $3.25, $4.00, $2.50, $2.25, and $1.25, 
we get approximate reductions of twenty or 
twenty-five per cent, but we need to see the 
books themselves to feel sure about it. Still 
another specimen page gives us the following 
net prices : $1.50, $1.25, $2.00, $ l.OO, $7.50, 
and $2.50. Here there is no indication that 
the prices are lower than they would have 
been under the old system, although it is, of 
course, quite possible that in every case the 
price might have been twenty or twenty-five 
per cent higher. But we think the publishers 
are acting unwisely, if that be true, in failing 
to make the fact more apparent to the casual 
reader. In a word, the ultimate success of 
the new system will depend, not upon pub- 
lishers' agreements and disciplinary measures, 
but upon the approval of the public ; and the 
public, which is naturally suspicious in all mat- 
ters that directly concern the pocket, should 
be made to understand in the clearest possible 
terms that it will not be asked to pay more 
for its new books than it has paid in the past. 
We believe that the simplest and best way of 
convincing the public that their purveyors of 
books are acting in good faith would be, as we 
have already suggested, to make the list prices 
of all new books multiples of twenty cents.

THE DIAL

Another aspect of this general question is 
in urgent need of consideration. We have 
seen what are the duties of publishers toward 
the purchasers of books under the new system ; 
something must now be said concerning their 
duties toward the authors of books. In this 
country, the prevailing royalty, as we all know, 
is ten per cent of the retail price of the book. 
As compared with the royalties paid in other 
countries, it is a low rate, and certainly should 
not be made any lower. Again taking our 
dollar book as a convenient example, we see 
that under the old system an author received 
ten cents for every copy of the book sold. 
Since the publisher got about sixty cents for 
the book, it amounted to paying the author 
one-sixth of the publisher's receipts. Also, 
since the book sold at retail for eighty cents, 
the author got one-eighth of the price paid by 
the individual purchaser. Now let us see how 
this arrangement is affected by the system of 
net prices. Assuming that the publisher acts 
fairly toward the public, and lists this book at 
eighty cents, the author, on a ten per cent 
royalty, would receive only eight cents a copy. 
In other words his earnings would be reduced 
one-fifth to the gain of the publisher. This 
is clearly wrong, and should be remedied by 
increasing the customary royalty to twelve and 
one-half per cent. In other words, an author, 
to be as well off as he was before, must still 
receive his ten cents a copy on the dollar book, 
which means one-eighth of the net retail price. 
Authors are proverbially careless of their own 
financial interests, but this question is one that 
affects them so seriously that they will have 
to take it into account, and insist upon the 
new basis of agreement with their publishers, 
should the latter fail to take the initiative in 
thus doing simple justice to the men whose 
books they publish. If publishers should show 
a disposition to cling to this special margin of 
profit accruing to them under the new system 
of prices, an American Walter Besant will 
need to arise to convince them of the error of 
their ways, and to champion the rights of 
American authors. 



An elaborate subscription edition of the works of 
James Fenimore Cooper, in thirty-two yolnmes, is an-

will be the inclusion of the famous series of steel en-

AN INTERESTING MEMORIAL OF TWO 
GREAT AUTHORS. 

(London Correspondence of Thb Dial.) 
The finding of any unpublished writing from the 
pens of two each illastrioas aathors as John Stoart 
Mill and Robert Browning would seem to be an ex- 
tremely unlikely event at this late date. However, 
this interesting experience has lately been mine in 
London. The literary world has long been familiar 
with the fact that the first poem written by Robert 
Browning — '' Pauline " — was published anony- 
mously ; that it was either completely ignored, or 
for the most part reviewed unfavorably, John Stuart 
Mill being one of the few who cared to enter some- 
what closely into the study of the poem. Bat when 
he offered a notice of it to "Tait's Magazine," 
his contribution was rejected by the editor on the 
ground that the book had already been noticed in 
a previous number, — said notice consisting merely 
of one line : " Pauline, a piece of pure bewilder- 
ment." Mill being young and obscure — for this 
occurred when Browning was but twenty-two and 
Mill but twenty- eight years old, — and having ac- 
cess to the pages of no other magazine, his com- 
ment was unpublished at the time, and has re- 
mained so, I believe until now. 

Copies of the first edition of " Pauline " are now 
extremely rare ; but within the past year the par- 
ticular copy owned first by Mill, afterward by 
Browning himself, and later presented by him to 
John Forster, has become the property of the South 
Kensington Museum in London. For some reason 
it was withheld from the •' Forster Collection " be- 
queathed to the Museum at Forster's death ; and the 
librarian looked not a little amazed when I asked 
for it, answering, " How do you know we have it ? 
It is not on our catalogue." However, no other 
formality than my register of name and address 
was necessary to bring the book out of its locked 
cupboard and into my hands, with the privileges of 
such memoranda as I should care to make. It 
proved to be even richer in interest than I had 
anticipated, containing not only Mill's marginal an- 
notations in pencil and Browning's rejoinders with 
the pen, — sometimes accepting, sometimes reject- 
ing Mill's strictures, — but also on the blank pages 
at the end Mill's entire article, still legible though 
written with the pencil, and probably in the exact 
words as rejected by " Tait's Magazine " sixty-eight 
years ago, before either poet or critic suspected 
his own future fame. This belated book-review, 
now receiving its first publication, can hardly fail 
to have a keen interest for lovers of litera 
ture ; nor can they fail to speculate on the prob- 
able loss to Browning by its suppression, in those 
early days when he waited so long for any kind of 
recognition from the public. To be sure, Mill's 
comments are far from being altogether fiattering, 
but to a young writer any serious treatment is bet- 
ter than absolute indifference. Here is the review : 



230 



THE DIAL. 



[Oct. 1, 



" With considerable poetic powers, this writer seems to me 
possessed with a more intense and morbid self-consciousness 
than I ever knew in any sane human being. I should think 
it a sincere confession, though of a most unloveable state, if 
the ' Pauline ' were not evidently a mere phantom. All 
about her is a halo of inconsistency, — he neither loves her 
nor fancies he loves her, yet insists upon talking love to her. 
If she existed and loved him, he treats her most ungraciously 
and unfeelingly. For all his aspirings and yearnings and re- 
grets point to other things, never to her ; then he pays her 
o£P toward the end by a piece of flummery amounting to a 
modest request that she will love him and live with him and 
give herself up to him without his loving ker, — moyennant 
quoi he will think her, and call her everything that is hand- 
some, and he promises her that she shall find it mighty pleas- 
ant. Then he leaves off by saying he knows he shall have 
changed his mind by tomorrow, and begins 'those intents 
which seem so fair,' but that having been thus visited once 
no doubt he will be again, — and is therefore ' in perfect joy,' 
and luck to him 1 as the Irish say. 

"A cento of most beautiful passages might be made from 
this poem, and the psychological history of himself is power- 
ful and truthful — truth-like certainly, all but the last stage. 
That, he evidently has not yet got into. The self-seeking 
and self-worshipping state he well described, — beyond that, 
I should think the writer had made, as yet, only the next 
step, viz., into disguising his own state. I even question 
whether a part of that self-disdain is not assumed. He is 
evidently dissatisfied, and feels part of the badness of his 
state ; he does not write as if it were purged out of him. If 
he could once muster a hearty hatred of his selfishness, it 
would go ; as it is, he feels only the lack of good, not the posi- 
tive evil. He feels not remorse, but only disappointment ; a 
mind in that state can only be regenerated by some new pas- 
sion, and I know not what to wish for him but that he may 
meet with a real Pauline. 

" Meanwhile he should not attempt to show how a person 
may be recovered from this morbid state, — for he is hardly 
convalescent, and ' what should we speak of but that which 
we know?'" 

"Pauline" was published in 1833, and that 
Mill's annotations were seen by Browning soon af- 
ter they were written is probable from the fact that 
on the fly-leaf is written in his own hand "R. 
Browning, October 30th, 1833." The inscription 
on the next page, " To my true friend, John For- 
flter," is probably of much later date. 

Browning's answers to Mill's marginal notes are 
highly interesting. Apropos of the lines, — 

"I rather sought 
To rival what I wondered at, than form 
Creations of my own ; so, much was light 
Lent back by others, yet much was my own," — 

Mill wrote: 

" This writer seems to use 'so ' according to the colloquial 
vulgarism in the sense of ' therefore ' or ' accordingly,' from 
which occasionally comes great obscurity and ambiguity, as 
here." 

To which Browning responds : 

" The recurrence of ' so ' thus employed is as vulgar as 
you please ; but the usage itself of ' so ' in the sense of ' ac- 
cordingly ' is perfectly authorized. Take an instance or two 
from Milton: 'So farewell Hope, and with Hope, farewell 
Pear.' — ' So on he fares and to the border comes of Eden.' — 
'So down they sat, and to their viands fell,' — 'So both 
ascend in the visions of God.' — ' So death becomes his final 
remedy.' — ' So in his seed all nations shall be blest. — ' So law 
appears imperfect.' — 'So all shall turn degenerate.' — 'So 
violence proceeded, and oppression.' " 

Browning's well-known later disapproval of his 



own early work is here definitely stated, these 
words being written opposite the title-page : 

" The following poem was written in pursuance of a fool- 
ish plan which occupied me mightily for a time and which 
had for its object the enabling me to assume and realize I 
know not how many different characters ; — meanwhile the 
world was never to guess that ' Brown, Jones, Smith, and 
Robinson ' (as the spelling-books have it), the respective au- 
thors of this poem, the other novel, such an opera, such a 
speech, were no other than one and the same individual. The 
present abortion was the first work of the Poet of the batch, 
who would have been more legitimately myself than most of 
the others ; but I surrounded him with all manner (to my 
then notion), poetical accessories, and had planned quite a 
delightful life for him. Only this- crab remains of the shapely 
Tree of Life in this Fool's paradise of mine. R. B." 

But to students of Browning's inner life, perhaps 
the most interesting page of all is the last one of 
the volume. Perhaps others have wondered, as I 
have, why this poem is always printed with the 
date, " Richmond, October 22nd, 1832," since 
Browning never lived at Richmond. In this volume 
Browning has underlined Richmond, and added : 

" Kean was acting there ; I saw him in Richard III. that 
night, and conceived the childish scheme already mentioned ; 
there is an allusion to Kean, page 47. I don't know whether 
I had not made up my mind to act, as well as to make verses, 
music, and God knows what, — que de chateaux en Espagnt ! " 

The lines on page 47, referred to, are these: 

" I will be gifted with a wondrous soul. 
Yet sunk by error to men's sympathy. 
And in the wane of life ; yet only so 
As to call up their fears ; and then shall come 
A time requiring youth's best energies ; — 
And straight I fling age, sorrow, sickness off, 
And I rise triumphing over my decay." 

It must have been one of the last, if not the very 
last, of Kean's performances when Browning saw 
him, for Kean was then acting but seldom, and he 
died in the following May. The critics have been 
in the habit of attributing " Pauline " mainly to 
Shelley's influence over Browning, but no one seems 
to have interpreted this passage with any reference 
to Kean, or to be aware that he had any part in in- 
spiring this " first heir of the invention " of Robert 
Browning. This will be <' new matter " for the 
Browning societies, direct from headquarters. 

A coincidence occurred to me just here, perhaps 
sufficiently striking to be worthy of mention. As 
I raised my eyes from this " Kean " note, I saw 
hanging exactly opposite a life-size painting of Ed- 
mund Kean as Richard III., painted by John 
James Hall. It was the merest accident, of course, 
that I had chosen the one seat in the room where 
this could have happened. Yet for the moment it 
gave me a distinct thrill, almost a shock, as if some 
magic had called up the actor's presence as Brown- 
ing saw it ; and for that moment Kean and Brown- 
ing and Mill seemed more real presences than the 
actual persons in the room, — an impression scarcely 
dimmed as I write now to describe a book so long 
inaccessible, but vital with the touch of two of the 
greatest minds of our century.

Stoby of an Earnest liiPE.* 



Only too few public careers in America have 
attested the single-minded devotion to principle 
which marks the life of the lawyer, legislator, 
soldier, governor, senator, and presidential can- 
didate whose story is told by himself in the 
large octavo volume styled " Personal Recollec- 
tions of John M. Palmer." Though presented 
in a manner far too artless to claim attention 
as literature, the book is so successful in inter- 
preting the man to his innumerable friends 
and acquaintance that it is deserving of every 
attention from students of history and public 
polity. 

John McAuley Palmer was born in Scott 
county, Kentucky, September 13, 1817, the 
son of a cabinet-maker who served his country 
in the war of 1812, and grandson of a revolu- 
tionary pensioner. The lad was reared by a 
God-fearing father who placed his earthly 
trust in the doctrines of Thomas Jefferson and , 
hated slavery with a hatred so thorough that it 
led to his removal from Kentucky to Madison 
County, Illinois, in 1831. It is to be observed, 
also, that the elder Palmer was one of the first 
advocates of total abstinence in a place and 
time when persecution followed rebuke of an 
almost universal custom of liquor- drinking. 
The boy attended Shurtleff College at Upper 
Alton, an institution which claims the distinc- 
tion of being the " oldest college in the 
Mississippi Valley," supporting himself by 
manual labor during his schooling and entering 
upon the study of law before obtaining his 
degree. He was admitted to the Illinois bar 
in December of 1839, Stephen A. Douglas 
being his sponsor to the court, his political 
shallop having then been launched through his 
acceptance of the nomination for county clerk 
a few months before. In 1842, young Palmer 
married Miss Malinda Ann Neely, such success 
as a young practitioner could boast having 
already fallen to his portion. In 1843 he was 
elected probate justice of the peace by a large 
majority, retaining his office until it was abol- 
ished by the constitution of 1848, an instru- 
ment in the making of which he had a full 
share, being a delegate to the convention which 
formulated it. In 1851 he was elected a senator 
of Illinois, taking his seat in a legislature which

Story of an Earnest Life. An Antobiogrraphy. Cincinnati: 
The Robert Clarke Company. 



numbered many men of great distinction, then 
and in after life. 

In 1854 the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska 
bill by Congress sent John M. Palmer, always 
a hater of slavery though never an abolitionist, 
over to the new-born Bepublican party. He 
assisted at the organization of the party in 
Illinois, was permanent president of the Bloom- 
ington Convention in 1856, and went as a 
delegate from that to the National Republican 
Convention which convened at Philadelphia in 
July of the same year. In September, 1859, 
he was unanimously nominated for Congress, 
but was beaten by four thousand vot«s, John 
Brown's attack upon Harper's Ferry strength- 
ening the opposition. Palmer was a delegate 
to the Republican State Convention at Decatur 
in May, 1860, and to the National Convention 
in Chicago a few weeks later. He served as 
one of the five Illinoisans in the Peace Con- 
vention on February 4, 1861, and while there 
was reconciled to Douglas, with whom he had 
quarrelled on leaving the Democratic party. 

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War Palmer 
was sent to Cairo by Governor Yates, and upon 
his return was chosen Colonel of the Sixth 
Congressional District Regiment, the Four- 
teenth Illinois Infantry. The modesty of the 
man leaves much of his military service unre- 
corded, but he was with the reinforcements 
after the battle of Wilson Creek and through 
the Springfield campaign, and was made brig- 
adier-general on December 20, 1861, taking 
command of a division of Indiana volunteers 
in the operations of General Grant against 
Island No. 10. He was at the battle of Stone 
River, and was made major-general soon after- 
wards. Efficient services were rendered by 
him at the battle of Chickamauga, but he re- 
garded the breaking- up of the Twenty-first 
Army Corps as a reflection upon the entire 
command and resigned his office. Lincoln 
refused to accept the resignation, and put him 
in command of the Fourteenth Army Corps 
soon after. At the beginning of Sherman's 
invasion he was embroiled in a controversy over 
seniority of office with General Schofield, who 
had received his commission a full year later, 
and again resigned. Again the resignation 
was disregarded, and General Palmer was giv- 
en command of the Department of Kentucky. 
The manner of his appointment is worth re- 
peating in detail, beginning with his conversa- 
tion in the White House: 

" I said to him, ' Mr. Lincoln, I wrote you a letter 
last September, saying that I did not wish to be one of

[Oct. 1, 



your unemployed generals, and you answered me on a 
card, saying " When I want your resignation, I will tell 
you." ' He said, « I have a job for you now, the com- 
mand of the Department of Kentucky.' I replied, ' I 
have commanded troops in the field during my military 
service, but I don't want to go to Kentucky and spend 
my time quarrelling with politicians.' He said, • Go to 
Stanton and get your orders, and come back here at 
nine o'clock to-morrow, and I '11 tell you who are our 
friends and what makes a change in that command 
necessary.' When I returned in the morning, I saw 
several persons going in and out of his room, and be- 
came slightly impatient, but when the colored door- 
keeper came and inquired for me, I entered the room 
and found him [Lincoln] seated in an office chair en- 
gaged in being shaved. He said, 'You are home folks, 
and I must shave. I cannot do go before senators and 
representatives who call upon me ; but I thought I 
could do so before you.' We then commenced to talk 
of the affairs of Kentucky. I repeated what I had said 
the evening before about my reluctance to go to Ken- 
tucky and quarrel with the politicians, and he said, ' Go 
to Kentucky, keep your temper, do as you please, and 
I will sustain you.' Then occured an incident which 
affords a key to Mr. Lincoln's policy and accounts for 
his successful conduct of the civil war. I was silent 
while the barber was shaving him about the neck, but 
after he was through with that particular part of his 
duties, I said, ' Mr. Lincoln, if I had known at Chicago 
that this great rebellion was to occur, I would not have 
consented to go to a one-horse town like Springfield, 
and take a one-horse lawyer, and make him president.' 
He pushed the barber from him, turned the chair, and 
said in an excited manner, ' Neither would I, Palmer. 
If we had had a great man for the presidency, one who 
had an inflexible policy and stuck to it, this rebellion 
would have succeeded, and the Southern Confederacy 
would have been established. All that I have done is, 
that I have striven to do my duty to-day, with the hope 
that when to-morrow comes, I will be ready for it! '" 

General Palmer left the army in September, 
1866 ; though General Grant offered him a 
brigadier-generalcy in the regulars, to which 
he replied, " I would rather be the police 
magistrate in the town where I live than a 
brigadier-general in time of peace." He prac- 
ticed law until November, 1868, when he was 
elected Governor of Illinois. Two things dis- 
tinguished his four years of administration : 
his steady resistance to the granting of all 
forms of special privilege, and his resentment 
of the authority assumed without warrant of 
law by the Federal authorities at the time of 
the Chicago fire of October, 1871. 

There is a gap of four years in the auto- 
biography, but it is known that Governor 
Palmer supported Greeley for the presidency 
in 1872. In 1876 he was one of the distin- 
guished men sent by the Democratic party into 
Louisiana to secure to Tilden the votes cast for 
that candidate, but the endeavor to go behind 
the returns was unsuccessful, and Hayes took 
the chief magistracy of the nation. In 1877 



Palmer was nominated as a candidate for the 
United States Senate, but declined. In 1888 
he accepted the Democratic nomination for the 
governorship, and was defeated. In 1890 he 
was placed in nomination for the United States 
Senate once more at the Democratic State 
Convention, and was duly elected by the Legis- 
lature to that position the following March. 
In 1896, he was placed in nomination for the 
presidency by the Democrats who had refused 
to accept the regular nomination of their party 
at the Chicago Convention. 

His first wife having died in 1885, Senator 
Palmer was married three years later to Mrs. 
Hannah L. (Lamb) Kimball, a widow, aud in 
her arms he died September 25, 1900. To 
her he acknowledges help in preparing this 
interesting memorial of a long life well spent. 
General Palmer's memory will live long in the 
hearts of those of his countrymen who admire 
moral greatness and unswerving sincerity of 
character. Wallace Rice. 



A Book about Rugs.* 



Rug-making in the Orient is an art, which, 
like all living arts, has been developed simply 
and naturally from the habits of life and cus- 
toms of the people. Useful as we find rugs 
and carpets to be in our households, their rela- 
tive value is beyond all comparison greater in 
the domestic economy of the nomad, or the 
man whose dwelling is arranged upon the 
simple model of the tent, as is the case through- 
out a large part of Asia. For him they are 
the chief furnishings of his habitation, and are 
a recognized form of property, scarcely less 
important than his weapons, his flocks, and his 
herds. It is no wonder then that he should 
strive to make them as perfect as possible for 
the purposes they have to serve, and as beau- 
tiful as his fancy can compass. In this way, 
what was doubtless in the beginning a mere 
industry, developed into an art which has been 
handed down from generation to generation, 
and kept alive until the present day by the 
conservatism of the hitherto immutable East, 
where manners, customs, and habits of life 
have persisted for centuries upon centuries 
substantially unchanged. Now, alas, the trans- 
forming power has appeared in the shape of 
foreign markets and the seductive cheapness

of foreign dyes. This transformation has been 
in progress for some twenty-five years or more, 
and latterly western merchants have invaded 
the rug-weaving countries, where they seek to 
control and direct the business of manufac- 
turing. 

Although it would seem obvious that it is for 
the interest of the western merchant to pre- 
serve the old methods intact, there is grave 
reason to fear that the Oriental craftsman's 
inherited skill in design, and more especially 
in dyeing, will in the not distant future be 
utterly lost. Commercialism has many sins to 
answer for, not least among which is the de- 
struction of the arts of primitive peoples. 
Among such peoples production is never upon 
what we would consider a commercial basis. 
For example, neither time nor labor enter into 
the calculation of the nomad weavers as an 
element of cost which they need consider when 
selling. The members of a family work to- 
gether, and having made such rugs as they 
require for their own use, they sell their sur- 
plus product for what they can get, be it much 
or little. The change comes when the opulent 
foreign buyers appear and compete against 
each other. Then it invariably happens that 
the stimulus of unusual demand causes haste in 
production and deterioration in the product ; 
while the habit of suiting the wares to the for- 
eigner's taste as certainly results in loss of fine 
perception on the part of the makers, and we 
wonder to what extent skill in design and in 
harmonious blending of color are attributable 
to traditional rules rather than to innate feeling. 

Happily, although every kind of error con- 
ceivable in connection with rug manufacture 
has been persistently introduced by European 
and American merchants, the art still lives, 
albeit in a crippled condition. If anything can 
save it from further decay it will be the educa- 
tion of the people who make the foreign mar- 
ket. While it is too much to expect that this 
can proceed upon such a scale as to materially 
affect trade conditions, yet the publication 
within a year of two important and sumptu- 
ously-illustrated books about rugs and rug- 
weaving, and their cordial reception by the 
public, may be taken as a favorable symptom. 

Miss Holt's book, as indicated by its sub- 
title, is designed as a " Handbook for Ready 
Reference," and as such it should serve a use- 
ful purpose. It is not intended to challenge 
comparison with Mr. Mumford's elaborate and 
epoch-making work, but " to present in concise 
form certain facts that may enable a novice to 



appreciate the beauty and interest attaching to 
rugs, and assist a prospective purchaser in 
judging of the merits of any particular rug he 
may desire to buy." To the general reader 
who does not care to delve deeply into the de- 
tails of the subject this treatment has its advan- 
tages. That there should be a good many 
points about which more ample information 
would seem desirable is inevitable under the 
circumstances. On the whole the leading facts 
are presented quite lucidly and accurately, and 
in very compact and readable form. 

As this review is written from advance 
sheets it does not seem worth while to com- 
ment on minor errors which may be corrected 
before the book is printed. It may however 
be noted that while most of the proper names 
are correctly rendered, the spelling of Sinna 
for Sehna, and of Derbent for Derbend are 
open to objection from the point of view of 
scientific transliteration. There is hardly suf- 
ficient warrant for the statement that " in de- 
sign and color the rugs woven to-day in the 
Orient are similar to the Assyrian and Baby- 
lonian textile fabrics of B. C. 1000-607 (Fall 
of Nineveh) and 538 (Fall of Babylon)." And 
it is obviously a blunder to say that there is 
now in the possession of Mr. Hay in England 
" a small rug discovered in that city [Thebes] 
some time between the years 666 and 358 
B. C." 

A book upon such a subject as that under 
consideration would be comparatively useless 
without the aid of illustrations. The twenty- 
four full-page reproductions of rugs with which 
the volume is adorned add much to its value. 
Twelve of these are in color, and present with 
wonderful truthfulness the effects of the beau- 
tifully harmonious and soft coloration of the 
fabrics reproduced. The other twelve, which 
are in monochrome, show the patterns as clearly 
and satisfactorily as could be expected from 
black and white. There are also six half-tone 
plates showing the conditions under which 
Oriental rugs are produced. The great cost 
of illustration in color forbids the introduction 
into a single volume of reproductions of all the 
typical weavings. The lack of such adequate 
illustration was a shortcoming in Mr. Mum- 
ford's book, and the plates in both books taken 
together suplement each other admirably and 
furnish material assistance to the student.

Two Views of Southern Recon- 
struction.* 



The attractiveness of the Reconstruction 
period of American history for doctorate dis- 
sertations is attested afresh by the appearance 
of " Reconstruction in Mississippi " by Mr. 
James Wilford Garner, and " The Reconstruc- 
tion of Georgia " by Mr. Edwin C. Woolley. 
The task of getting the seceded States back 
into their " proper practical relations," as Lin- 
coln expressed it, has been made the subject 
of a monograph for almost every State that 
revolted in 1860 and 1861. In nearly every 
instance these writings have been the fruits of 
class-room instruction and library investiga- 
tion, and as such they form a strong contrast 
to books written by those who participated in 
the work they describe, being the product of 
a younger generation than that which engaged 
in the practical work of Reconstruction. The 
partisan spirit characterizing such books as 
Logan's " Great Conspiracy " on the one side, 
and Herbert's " Why the Solid South ? " on the 
other, is replaced in these dissertations by a 
calm presentation of the testimony on both 
sides and conclusions reached from its study. 
Although one of these volumes was written by 
a native of Mississippi, and the other by a 
native of Illinois, the reader searches their 
pages in vain for evidences of sectional ani- 
mosity or even prejudice. It is true that the 
darker aspect of the " carpet bag " rule appears 
in the Southern author, while the Northern 
man finds evidences of nothing much worse 
than extravagance in that unsavory regime. 
But that the Southern people should have been 
willing to return, repentantly or unrepentantly, 
to the bonds they had been trying to break, 
both authors agree in thinking would have been 
" unnatural " and " extraordinary." 

The volume on Mississippi is the more am- 
bitious of the two, being really a political his-

tory of the State from 1860 to 1875. The 
author describes the devastated condition of 
the State at the close of the war, and the 
eagerness with which many of the citizens un- 
dertook to accept the mild terms of President 
Johnson in the summer of 1865. But the 
situation was greatly aggravated by the pres- 
ence of troops, and especially black troops, 
most obnoxious to the South. To the lax and 
partisan white commanders of these troops, the 
records point much of the friction that oc- 
curred. Mr. Garner deplores the " black laws " 
passed by these Johnson governments for regu- 
lating the freedman, although his abundant 
quotations from newspapers show a state almost 
reaching terrorism from the license of the 
blacks. Yet he sees that these laws gave to 
Congress, flushed with triumph and regarding 
President Johnson as a Southern man and 
sympathizer, an opportunity to gain an ascend- 
ancy, which culminated in the harsh acts of 
1867. An account of the " revolution of 
1875," which overthrew the Congressional 
governments in the reconstructed States and 
brought the Democratic party again into con- 
trol of Mississippi, concludes an interesting 
and scholarly volume. In three rather distinct 
chapters, side phases of Reconstruction — the 
Freedman's Bureau, the Ku Klux, and Educa- 
tion — are thoroughly treated. 

Mr. Woolley, in his study of " The Recon- 
struction of Georgia," has confined himself to 
the political question involved, arguing from a 
political-science standpoint. He weighs care- 
fully the constitutionality of the many questions 
that arose in the rapidly succeeding govern- 
ments in Georgia. So far as the Southern 
view of Congressional government is concerned, 
he thinks the people hated this government 
" partly for what it did, but more for what it 
was." He regards the enfranchisement of the 
negro as a grievous mistake, since it checked 
the friendly spirit of the white man toward 
him, a check from which it has not yet recov- 
ered. From a political viewpoint also he thinks 
it was a mistake. The Republicans lost the 
support of the Southern whites who had been 
opposed to secession, and these formed a large 
party in Georgia. For a time this loss was 
made good by the negro vote, but not long.^ 
Reconstruction brought the Fourteenth Amend- 
ment, but a long line of decisions of the 
Supreme Court has determined that the Four- 
teenth Amendment did not achieve the nation- 
alization of civil rights.

appears to good advantage, since he writes 
from a critical or polemical purpose, while Mr.

Epochs and Epoch-Makbrs.* 



Modern educational reading has come to be 
pretty highly organized ; and among its effect- 
ive agencies a definite place and function have 
been found for the various " series " which 
present in compact form (usually one moderate 
volume) the results of scholars' studies in the 
world's history and biography. Standing mid- 
way between the scattered original sources and 
the constraint of an Encyclopjedia article, 
these '' stories " of the nations and of the 
nations' heroes seem to divine and to meet the 
temper of our time. As most of the writers of 
these monographs are university professors, it 
would seem, too, that we are learning to utilize 
our scholars for a direct popular advantage in 
a way unimagined by a former generation. 

One of these series, under the suggestive — 
if somewhat Teutonic — title of " The World's 
Epoch-Makers," is that edited by Mr. Oliphant 
Smeaton, and intended to present, when the 
issue is complete, a conspectus of the most 
prominent movements that have taken place in 
theology, philosophy, and the history of intel- 
lectual development, from Buddha to the present 
day, — the last name being Cardinal Newman. 
Of the twenty-eight volumes announced, seven 
have thus far appeared, the subjects naturally 
not being chosen in chronological order ; and 
the three latest of these form the occasion of 
this notice. 

In " Francis and Dominic, and the Mendi- 
cant Orders " by Professor Herkless of the 
University of St. Andrews, we have an account 
of the lives of these mediaeval saints which 
lifts their personality into sharp relief against 
the confused background of their time. Though 
Dr. Herkless is calm, he is not cold ; and his 
portrayal of the lovely character of Francis of 
Assisi is warmly sympathetic to a degree not 
looked for in a Scottish professor. Yet it is 
just the idyllic sweetness of such a soul as that

of St. Francis that finds its quickest response in 
North British thought and feeling ; and we 
recognize without surprise that the writer has 
the right key to at least one door when he says : 
« His [Francis's] education in the school of the Troa- 
badoors, more than the education of the Church's 
school, prepared him for the wandering life of poverty 
in which his love to Christ had a lyric sweetness and 
his actions for men bad often the character of romance." 

It is made the glory of Francis, with his car- 
dinal virtues of poverty, humility and love, 
that 

" He spread religion beyond the cloister and carried 
it into family life. . . . Poverty was for Francis, 
as for Dominic, not simply a question of property 
or money ; it meant for them the sum of the vir- 
tues or graces in the character of Jesus Christ. . . . 
Poverty was the watchword of Francis. Before his 
day religion was little more than attention to the 
observances of the church. He, on the other hand, was 
the preacher of personal piety. His love flowed to 
Christ, and conduct was an imitation of His sacred 
life. Dominic in the same manner sought to invite 
men to religion, preaching the gospel and teaching 
the truths of the Church's dognta. Francis chose to 
preach, but also to show forth the beauty of holiness 
by imitation of Christ. The end sought by the two 
saints alike was to stimulate piety, not by drawing 
men to the cloister for contemplation, but by keeping 
them in the world for the practice of righteousness. " 

The fact that the mendicant orders so often 
and so far fell away from the noble standard 
set by their founders only serves to identify 
them, mournfully enough, with Christianity 
in general ; but in spite of defects in morality 
and excesses in superstition their services to 
religion and civilization were real and impor- 
tant. Professor Herkless does not hesitate to 
say: 

" The mendicants, while acting as the servants of the 
church, unintentionally fostered the tendency to criti- 
cize ecclesiastical pretensions and priestly professions, 
and to examine the validity of the dogma. Stimulated 
to piety, the soul found freedom and rejoiced, and in 
its freedom took up the task of testing authority, and 
the Reformation was the far-off result. Taught by the 
mendicants that religion must govern conduct, men 
listened to their doctrine, and inquired and thought, 
and judged. " 

The progress of the Franciscan and Domi- 
nican orders, and their prominence in ecclesi- 
astical and scholastic history, are discussed 
by the author in a couple of interesting chap- 
ters. " In 1825, at the close of six hundred 
years of history, the Dominicans counted among 
their numbers four popes, seventy cardinals, 
four hundred and sixty bishops, four presi- 
dents of General Councils, twenty-five legates 
a latere^ eighty apostolic nuncios, and one 
prince- elector of the Holy Roman Empire. " 
The Franciscan Minorites show a shorter roll

of five popes, fifty cardinals, and a host of 
minor prelates ; but in the realm of scholas- 
tic thought their list lengthens with such 
names as Alexander Hales, John Bonaven- 
tura, Duns Scotus (Doctors respectively Irre- 
fragable, Seraphic, and Subtle), Raymond 
Lully, William of Occam, and Roger Bacon ; 
as against only two great Dominican fathers, 
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, 
"Universal" and "Angelical" though these 
were. On the whole. Dr. Herkless has given 
us a book to be commended. He " sees things 
steadily and sees them whole "; and reports 
what he sees without prejudice, and yet with 
appreciation and even sympathy. His wide 
range of reading is attested by a copious bib- 
liography, and his consideration for students 
by an unusually minute index. 

Another volume in the same series is a 
study of the life and work of Savonarola, by 
the Rev. George M'Hardy, D.D. It is not 
necessary to expect at this day any additions 
to our knowledge of what the great preacher 
of San Marco said and did in Florence in 
the closing years of the fifteenth century. We 
can only read the story again, and try to 
measure the potency of the motives which dis- 
tracted that heroic soul. Dr. M'Hardy has 
made good use of his authorities, from Villari 
down to George Eliot and Frederick Myers ; 
and in simple straightforward language he 
tells the tale of Savanarola's troubled life, 
from his leap into fame by the apocalyptic 
sermon preached at Brescia in 1486, to the 
final tragedy of the Piazza della Signoria in 
1498. The limitations of his character are 
not denied, but are explained by his temper- 
ament and the conditions of the age. In jus- 
tifying his resistance to the fulminations of 
the infamous Alexander VI., Dr. M'Hardy 
takes the only possible Protestant view of that 
world-old question. He deprecates George 
Eliot's criticism of Savonarola's failure to 
interfere on behalf of the condemned Medi- 
cean conspirators ; claiming reasonably enough 
that the right of appeal to the Greater Coun- 
cil was one that he had never advocated, and 
further that, as an excommunicated priest, he 
was debarred from any suitable opportunity of 
moving the public mind. On the other hand, 
our author goes too far in becoming an apolo- 
gist for Savonarola's iconoclastic zeal in con- 
signing works of art to the flames along with 
the wigs and masks which were proper fuel 
for the " Pyramid of Vanities. " 

The fatal embarrassments which obscured 



Savonarola's real greatness are well summed 
up in the concluding chapter, and assigned to 
the following causes : First, his attempt to 
combine the role of political director with that 
of religious teacher and reformer. Second, 
as a reformer of morals, he imposed restraints 
which inevitably provoked revolt. Third, he 
assumed a hazardous prerogative by his per- 
sistent though sincere claim to direct divine 
illumination. In spite of these, however, the 
author fairly establishes his thesis, claiming 
for the eloquent Fra Girolamo a place among 
the world's epoch-makers by virtue of " the 
moral passion he inspired — the feeling he 
awakened in a sordid, pagan age of the great 
ends of life, of the needs and claims of man's 
immortal nature, of the glory of truth and the 
noble endeavor for right." 

In all her age-long history, the Church never 
had a nobler son than Ansel m of Canterbury. 
It fell to him to illustrate the passive virtues 
of Christianity in a degree which could only 
remind men of the Founder himself. Italian 
by birth, Norman by adoption, English by for- 
cible translation, this gentle soul yearned for 
cloistered peace, spiritual growth, and the win- 
ning of souls ; but after thirty-three years of 
monastic life, he was coerced into accepting 
(if that be possible) the primacy of all England. 
How he bore himself in that great office ; how, 
in the unending wrangle between Church and 
State, he held out with infinite patience against 
the blasphemous and brutal William Ruf us and 
the cautious and unscrupulous Henry I., and 
won for the Church, the monarchy, and En- 
gland more than any of them dreamed of, — 
all this, and more, is admirably set forth in 
the Rev. A. C. Welch's volume. Aside from 
the clear and consistent narrative, this little 
book deserves a place in literature by the 
felicity of its style. Nearly every page con- 
tains some bit of pungent observation, some 
telling comparison, some convincing exposition 
of motive ; and all couched in chaste, spon- 
taneous English, which rarely falters. 

One fairly representative passage may be 
cited, from the description of the great council 
held at Rockingham Castle in 1095, to decide 
whether the Archbishop should be allowed to 
go to Rome to receive the pallium from the 
hands of Urban II., whom William the Red 
refused to recognize. Abandoned by his bish- 
ops, beset by cynical courtiers, threatened by 
the Red King, he could only pray and wait and 
be firm. 

"And in the gathering dusk where the frail monk

sat wearied among his few supporters a sense of the 
dignity of this one man who alone in all England dared 
to show front to the dreaded Rafos crept into the minds 
of some among the commons. Suddenly a knight de- 
tached himself from the rest, and kneeling before the 
archbishop bade him be of good cheer. 'Remember 
how holy Job on the dungheap routed the devil and 
avenged Adam whom the devil had routed in Paradise.' 
The quaint, uncouth words went round the archbishop's 
heart like wine. For it is something, let a man have 
fought for as high ends as he will and be fully convinced 
of the righteousness of his cause, to know that he is 
not alone. Probably the knight knew little about the 
immediate issue of the struggle, understood little about 
papal claims and royal rights. But the English sense 
of fair-play was appealed to, and that deeper sense of 
the right to appeal to law against power which has 
rarely deserted the race. It was a day to be marked 
with a white stone in the cause of English liberty and 
English law, the day when the lustful arrogant Norman 
kings learned that there was a limit set to their power, 
and that any man, monk, priest, or layman, dared resist 
their will."

The Psychologt of Play.* 



The earlier work of Karl Groos on " The 
Play of Animals," already published in an 
English translation, made a profound sensa- 
tion ; and with the present volume on " The 
Play of Man," it is probably the most compre- 
hensive and satisfactory study yet made of the 
psychology of play. The matter in the new 
book is divided into three parts — Playful 
Experimentation, Playful Exercise of Impulses 
of the Second or Socionomic Order, and The 
Theory of Play. The child — or the man — 
in playful experimentation, exercises his sen- 
sory apparatus, his motor apparatus, and his 
higher mental powers. Groos exhaustively 
considers the matter of experimentation in each 
of these directions. From such experimenta- 
tion, a valuable training for the individual 
results. Not that the playful use of the various 
powers aims at discovery, improvement, and 
development ; intentionally directed to useful 
ends, the exercise ceases to be play. Passing 
from individual play experimentation to play- 
ful exercise of impulses of the second or socio- 
nomic order, the author considers this under 
the divisions of fighting play, imitative play, 
and social play. The review is remarkably 
complete. The method is inductive and com- 
parative. Play of the animal, of the child, of

Elizabeth L. Baldwin. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



the savage, and of civilized man, are brought 
into relation and made to contribute mutually 
to conclusions. In the final very brief part of 
the book, the theory of play is discussed. The 
difficulty of adequately presenting Groos's 
treatment in a brief notice is greatest at this 
point. The theory of play is considered from 
six standpoints — the physiological, biological, 
psychological, aesthetic, sociological, and peda- 
gogical. We may briefly refer to some of 
these. In the explanation of play there are 
three views, " none of which science should 
neglect " : (a) Play serves as a discharge for 
superabundant vigor ; (b) Play is an oppor- 
tunity for relaxation and recreation of ex- 
hausted powers ; (c) Play has a teleological 
significance, it is a training, preparatory to 
the tasks of life. The author grounds the 
physiological theory of play upon the first and 
second of these, though the first is admitted to 
often act alone in youth. But the statement 
of a physiological theory, as such only, is un- 
satisfactory. It reduces itself largely to the 
propositions — we play because we have an 
impulse to play ; we repeat the playful act 
until weary, because we have an impulse to 
repetition. To find the origin of these impulses 
and a basis for his teleological practice theory, 
the author turns to the biological standpoint. 
Here, in the advantage of experimental play 
and the action of natural selection, he finds 
that of which he is in search. When speaking 
of the theory of play from the pedagogical 
standpoint, Groos says : " There are two ways 
of regarding the relation of play to education. 
Instruction may take the form of playful ac- 
tivity, or, on the other hand, play may be con- 
verted into systematic teaching." He warns 
against the extreme in either method. 

The book requires careful and thoughtful 
reading and re-reading. The matter is none 
of the simplest, and we may question whether 
it has been rendered easier by the translator. 
If she found the following passage as she gives 
it, she ought to have changed it : " She adopted 
the rather forward manner of speaking, prac- 
tised by a boy of whom she was thrown with 
for a while " (p. 296). The translator is un- 
fortunate in her rendering of geographical and 
ethnic terms. The Marquise Islands^ Moluh- 
ken dwellers, and Botohu are neither English 
nor German. But we are too thankful for 
having this important work in English to find 
much fault with a translation the preparation 
of which presented unusual difficulties.

Recent Poetry.* 

The accumulated poetry of somethiDg like half 
a year is clamorous for attention, and we have 
selected from a considerable pile of volumes those 
that seem to be deserving of examination. The 
names are for the most part unknown to fame, 
although a few are poets of repute, if not of dis- 
tinction. In the case of Mr. George Meredith, 
who must occupy the first place in this review, the 
distinction is unquestioned, and he has only his 
own perversity to thank if gratitude and admira- 
tion are not invariably linked with the respect 
evoked by his productions. One of the greatest 
and sanest spirits that have been working in the 
English literature of the past forty years, he has 
chosen, by an afiEectation of the grotesque and ob- 
scure in expression, to estrange the larger cultivated 
public from his following, and to appeal only to 
the few who are courageous enough to force a 
path through the thicket of his thorn-set utterance. 
His endowment both as poet and thinker is proba-

bly equal to that of Robert Browning, but he has 
outdone even the poet of " Sordello " in the matter 
of reckless cacophany and darkly elliptical forms of 
expression. As we write these words we have in 
mind the last volume by Mr. Meredith that occu- 
pied our attention, the volume of " Odes " upon 
the major happenings of a century of French 
history. We recall the strange verbal monsters 
that guarded the approach to the thought of those 
fearful and wonderful compositions — 

" The friable and the grumous, dizzards both " — 
and it is with no slight apprehension that we open 
the pages of " A Reading of Life, " the new 
volume that now calls for consideration. It is 
pleasant to be able to say that this volume, 
although still typically Meredithian, reverts in some 
measure to the poet's earlier manner and exhib- 
its more of the poetical graces of harmony and 
lucidity than we had expected. The " Reading of 
Life," with which the volume opens, is a set of 
four pieces which bid us choose between Artemis 
and Aphrodite, setting forth the rapture of either 
worship — the spiritual and the sensual — and 
reconciling the conflicting claims, in one high syn- 
thesis. 

" Not far those two great Powers of Nature speed 

Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead ; 

Not either points for us the way of flame. 

From him predestined mightier it came ; 

His task to hold them both in breast, and yield 

Their dues to each, and of their war be field. " 

This is " The Test of Manhood," to be — 

*' Obedient to Nature, not her slave : 

Her lord, if to her rigid laws he bows ; 
Her dust, if with his conscience he plays knave, 
And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse." 

This is the substance of Mr. Meredith's deepest 
meditations upon the conduct of life. It is the 
ideal of upright, temperate, balanced manhood, 
recognizing the claims of both sense and spirit, 
alike avoiding the snare of the licentious and the 
ascetic. We find its deepest expression in these lines 
from the poem called " Foresight and Patience." 

"Ay, be we faithful to ourselves: despise 
Naught but the coward in us ! That way lies 
The wisdom making passage through our slough. 
Am I not heard , my head to Earth shall bow ; 
Like her, shall wait to see, and seeing wait. 
Philosophy is Life's one match for Fate. 
That photosphere of our high fountain One, 
Our spirit's Lord and Reason's fostering sun. 
Philosophy shall light us in the shade. 
Warm in the frost, make Good our aim and aid." 

Before taking leave of this volume, we must find 
room for one delicate lyric. 

"They have no song, the sedges dry, 

And still they sing. 
It is within my breast they sing. 

As I pass by. 
Within my breast they touch a string, 

They wake a sigh. 
There is but sound of sedges dry ; 

In me they sing."

Desire," has doubtless widened the circle of Mr. 
W. B. Yeats's readers, and all those who felt the 
exquisite charm of that bit of dramatic poetry will 
be glad to make the acquaintance of " The Shadowy 
"Waters," the poet's latest work. This, too, is 
dramatic in form, but woven of a dream-tissue so 
impalpable that ordinary words are well-nigh pow- 
erless to convey the impression that it leaves upon 
the mental vision of the reader. The poet says in 
a proem, 

" My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires ; 
And the images I have woven in this story 
Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters 
Moved roand me in the voices and the fires." 

The story is of a galley of adventurers who have 

sailed far northward, and whose 

"Sail has passed 
Even the wandering: islands of the gods. 
And hears the roar of the streams where, dmids say, 
Time and the world and all things dwindle oat." 

The sailors seek to slay the leader who has thus 
taken them far from the haunts of men and the 
hope of booty, but are restrained by the music of 
his magic harp. Unexpectedly a strange ship is 
sighted, presently captured, and its crew put to the 
sword. A fair woman alone is spared, and she, at 
first defiant, succumbs to the spell of the harp, and 
gives herself heart and soul to the player. Their 
companions left upon the captured ship, these two, 
filled with a vision of the land of heart's desire, 
where love shall be changed from " brief longfing, 
and deceiving hope, and bodily tenderness " to 
" imperishable fire," speed still further northward 
" to the streams where the world ends." As the 
poem closes, Dectora puts her arms about Forgael, 
and thus adjures him : — 

" Bend lower, O King, 
O flower of the branch, bird among the leaves, 
O silver fish that my two hands have taken 
Oat of a ninning stream, morning star 
Trembling in the bine heavens like a white fawn 
Up>on the misty border of the wood, — 
Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair. 
For we will gaze npon this world no longer." 

Even so summary an account as has here been 
attempted does wrong to the haunting beauty of 
this poem ; for its finer qualities elude both analysis 
and exhibition. 

One does not expect great poetry from Sir Lewis 
Morris, and one must be prepared to find in his 
work whole tracts of bald platitude and incurable 
commonplace. Yet it is impossible to withhold a 
certain tribute of respect from a man who has 
through a long life so respected the art of song, 
and, to use his own words, " has throughout endeav- 
oured to follow the honoured traditions of English 
poetry." In his new "Harvest-Tide" he has brought 
together his poems of recent years, and the collec- 
tion includes an ode for the Victorian jubilee of 
1897, a long narrative poem called " A Georgian 
Romance," a philosophical disquisition on " The 
March of Man," and a considerable variety of 
lesser pieces. Tennyson's " The Higher Pan- 



theism " is followed — at a marked distance — in 
the couplets of " A New Orphic Hymn," which 
opens in the following fashion : 

" The stars, the skies, the peaks, the deeps of the fathom- 
less seas, 
Inmianent is He in all, yet higher and deeper than these." 

The Tennysonian influence is apparent in many of 
these productions, and notably in the writer's in- 
sistence upon the spiritual struggle which man is 
ever called upon to wage with the brutal strain in 
his inheritance. One poem, " The Union of Hearts," 
is a paean of praise for the defeat of Spain by the 
United States. 

" The isles once more are free. 
No more the down-trod peoples cry in vain. 
In long-anheeded pain ; 

They are free, they are free once more, after rebellious years 
Of misery and tears." 

In view of subsequent happenings, these lines have 
an nnintended irony that even the writer can hardly 
fail to see. 

Mr. Lawrence Binyon's " Odes " are eight in 
number, moderate in length, upon such themes as 
" The Bacchanal of Alexander," " The Death of 
Tristram," " Orpheus in Thrace," and " The Belfry 
of Bruges." We quote a fine passage from the 
'* Orpheus " poem, the singer's apostrophe to his 
lyre. 

" Ah, marvelloas once was thy power 
In the marvelloas days of old ! 
I touched thee, and all hearts heard. 

And the snake had no thought to devoar. 
And the shy fawn stayed and was bold. 
And the panther crept near in desire ; 
And the toppling symplegades hong 
To hearken thy strings as I sung, 
And Argo glanced through like a bird. 
Like a swallow, to hear thee, my lyre I " 

These " Odes " are not deeply impressive, but they 
are serious and dignified poems, with striking dr^ 
matic effects, and inspired by a noble idealism. 

Mr. Sidney Boyse Lysaght, the author of " Poems 
of the Unknown Way," is a new writer to us, and 
one whose first volume (if this be his first) strikes 
a note of austere idealism that is uncommon enough 
to arrest attention. It is the note of failure, in a 
sense, of disillusionment, and of brooding melan- 
choly, but it is also the note of determination to 
make the best of spiritual defeat, and to rise above 
the wreck of an old faith to the plane of a new and 
higher hope. There is nothing finer in the volume 
than its dedication " To my Comrades," from which 
we quote. 

" You, who once dreamed on earth to make yonr mark. 
And kindle beacons where its ways were dark ; 
To whom, for the world that had no need of you. 

It once had seemed a little thing to die ; 
Who gave the world your best, and in return 
No honors won, and no reward could earn ! 
Sad Comrade, we were shipmates in one crew, — 
Somewhere we sailed tc^ether, you and I. 

" You against whom all fates have been arrayed ; 
Who heard the voice of Qod and disobeyed ; 
Who, reckless and with all your battles lost. 
Went forth again another chance to try ;

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Who, fighting desperate odds yet fought to win, 
And sinning bore the burden of your sin I 

We have been on the same rough ocean tossed, 
And served the same wild captain, you and I." 

Mr. Lysaght's poems are grouped in two sections, — 
" The Undiscovered Shore," and " A Ritual." 
From the former group we take " The Penalty of 
Love," a sonnet quite beautiful enough to be its own 
excuse for being. 

" If love should count you worthy, and should deign 
One day to seek your door and be your guest. 
Pause ! ere you draw the bolt and bid him rest, 

If in your old content you would remain. 
For not alone he enters : in his train 

Are angels of the mists, the lonely quest, 

Dreams of the unfulfilled and unpossessed. 

And sorrow, and Life's immemorial pain. 

" He wakes desire you never may forget. 
He shows you stars you never saw before. 
He makes you share with him, for evermore, 

The burden of the world's divine regret. 
How wise are you to open not I — and yet. 
How poor if you should turn him from the door." 

More in keeping with the suggestion of the sub- 
title is such a poem as " The Ends of the Earth," 
with its almost Swinburnian movement. The follow- 
ing stanza may be said to sound the keynote of the 
poet's whole thought: 

" When man wins truth from the years, the loss with his 

dreams he pays ; 
Bat in time the knowledge he won but leads again to a 

dream. 
And the wonder ever remains ; and a mystery more supreme 
Than the distant promised of old, is hidden in homely ways. ' ' 

Mr. Lysaght's '' Ritual " expresses a faith that is 
well represented by the following lines: 

" Be it our ritual to read 
In Life our Faith, in Truth our Creed. 
Let Fear its graven tables break. 
And Love our ten commandments make. 
Let us, when heaven no light imparts. 
Our gospel seek in human hearts ; 
Our hymns of praise on children's lips ; 
In Beauty, our Apocalypse, 
And let the burdens all must bear 
In silence, be our common prayer ; 
Let every flower that cleaves the sod 
Become to us a word of God ; 
And, lifting heavenward Life's intent. 
Love be, itself, our Sacrament 1 " 

The religious feeling of these lovely verses may seem 
unsatisfactory to souls stiffened by formalism and 
wedded to outworn creeds, but it is nevertheless 
religious feeling of the most vital and inspiring sort, 
and its sanctions spring from the deepest founts of 
the spiritual life. 

"The Queen's Chronicler and Other Poems " is a 
volume of verse by Mr. Stephen Gwynn. We say 
" verse " advisedly, for Mr. Gwynn, although an 
excellent craftsman in various forms of prose, has 
little of the poet's inspiration, and plain sense rather 
than emotional quality is the salient characteristic 
of his measures. The title-poem is a versification of 
the Mary Stuart story after Brant 6me. The follow- 
ing stanza is typical of the form, besides serving to in- 
dicate the author's attitude toward the rival queens. 



" Well, there they stand, pursuer and pursued. 

Famous alike now by the common voice. 
One is the bad, no doubt, and one the good : 

In one the gods, in one the devils, rejoice. 
One has been canonised by Mr. Froude, 

The other by old Brantome ; take your choice. 
Say, for the name that each has after death. 

Would you be Mary or Elizabeth ? " 

This is the longest poem in the volume. The others 
are of miscellaneous sort: descriptions, personal 
tributes, historical episodes, and philosophical mus- 
ings. " A Death Mask " is a pathetic piece, sugges- 
tive of Browning, inspired by the sight of a woman's 
body in the Paris Morgue. 

"Those baffling eyes ! — Behind each lid. 
Each drawn-down lid, the soul shines through, 
And yon can tell that they were blue, — 
And yet what message hold they hid ? 
Dumb eyes ! But he that saw them turn. 
How deep ! how soft I and melt and yearn 
In utter love upon him bent. 
Never saw them so eloquent. 
Who shall divine ? But if her leap 
To other lands than lands of sleep 
Launch her, and he may follow, where 
He can confess till his life lies. 
Pierced through and thrilling with her eyes. 
He yet may be forgiven there.'' 

Mr. Arthur Legge's " Town and Country Poems " 
are fairly described by this title. Some of the pieces 
evoke images of natural beauty, and the thoughts 
that cannot escape the reflective mind when in the 
presence of the woods and the fields ; others betray 
the shrewd observation of a dweller among men, 
inspired to a semi-satirical philosophy by the trivial 
preoccupations and the feverish unrest of modern 
life. In both classes of poems, the manner is pleas- 
ant enough, but the technique is mechanical, and 
there is little of the deeper sort of poetic emotion. 
The author is at his best in such a piece as " Gipsy 
Souls," from which we will quote. 

"There is a secret brotherhood, whose rules 
Are never framed, whose watchword is unknown, 
Whose dogmas flourish not in learned schools. 
Whose creed is but a precept to disown 
The wisdom of a world that names them fools ; 
A band where brother scarce encounters brother. 
But treads the maze alone. 
Doubtful of life's enrichment with another 
To share his thought, bruised in the human press. 
And as the roving wind companionless." 

" They glide like shadows through the trailing years, 
Their voice a cry from an eternal Past. 
Their laughter floats across a wave of tears ; 
They play with all the passions, and are cast 
Into Love's furnace of delights and fears; 
But Hope's brave banner, on the tide of Sorrow, 
Floats proudly from their mast. 
They lose not Yesterday, yet win To-morrow ; 
And, where the golden sunset flames afar. 
They seek their haven in an unborn star." 

These are the first and last stanzas of a poem that 
has given us unusual pleasure. 

" Deirdre Wed " is the title poem of Mr. Herbert 
Trench's volume, and is longer than all the " other 
poems " taken together. Since Mr. Trench affects 
an almost Meredithian obscurity of diction, and since 



1901.]

Celtic legend at its best is misty in outline, the 
poem is a difficult one to follow, and we shall make 
no attempt to describe it, beyond saying that the 
story is told in sections by bards of several far- 
separated centuries. The pages that follow this 
poem prove more quotable. The following lyric is 
well deserving of reproduction : 

" Come, let ns make love deathless, thoa and I, 

Seeing that our footing on the Earth is brief — 
Seeing that her multitades sweep out to die 

Mocking at all that passes their belief. 
For standard of oar love not theirs we take : 

If we go hence to-day 
Fill the high cup that is so soon to break 

With richer wine than they ! 

"Ay, since beyond these walls no heavens there be 

Joy to revive or wasted youth repair, 
I'll not bedim the lovely flame in thee 

Nor sally the sad splendor that we wear. 
Great be the love, if with the lover dies 

Our greatness past recall. 
And nobler for the fading of those eyes 

The world seen once for all," 

If this message fail to prove acceptable to the soul 
of broader faith, there can at least be no quarrel 
with such counsel as is given us in " A Charge." 

" Last, if upon the cold green-mantling sea, 

Thoa cling, alone with Troth to the last spar. 
Both castaway 
And one must perish — let it not be he 
Whom thou art sworn to obey I " 

" An Iseult Idyl, and Other Poems," by Mr. G. 
Constant Lounsbery, is a volume of classical and 
romantic echoes, with a few graceful lyrics of no 
definite provenance. "We like the following " Ron- 
del " about as well as anything in the collection, 
although choice is difficult where all is exquisite : 

" Sleep is a thornless rose upon Life's breast. 
Whose opalescent petals breathe forth rest ; 
More mellow than the moon's melodious light. 
Subtle of fragrance, fraught with strange delight 
Of fragile dreams and delicate repose. 
Sleep is a thornless rose ! 

" Love is a blood-red rose of poignant thorn 
Whereby the flower-soft heart is bled and torn. 
While all the crimson leaves bum brighter, gain 
New lustre from the crimson drops of pain. 
How brief its beauty ; yet, while still it glows. 
Love is a blood-red rose ! " 

Herodotus tells us how Neco, King of Egypt, 
believing Libya (Africa) to be surrounded by 
water, " sent certain Pbcsnicians in ships, with 
orders to sail back through the Pillars of Hercules, 
into the Northern Sea, and so return to Egypt." 
This passage is the text upon which Sir Edwin 
Arnold has written his long narrative poem, " The 
Voyage of Ithobal." The story of the journey is 
told by Ithobal himself, at the court of Pharaoh, 
after the successful accomplishment of his task. 
The recital fills seven days, and thus occasions a 
division of the poem into as many cantos or sec- 
tions. The adventures of the mariners are many 
and various, and the author has given free scope to 
his picturesque invention. There are prophetic 
foreshadowings of Vasco da Gama and Mr. Stanley, 



and the wild beasts of Africa are described in the 
light of modern knowledge. The story is stirring, 
and one can hardly escape a thrill when Gibraltar 
is reached on the homeward voyage. 

" Here is the Ocean-Qate I Here is the Strait, 
Twice before seen, where goes the Middle Sea 
Unto the Setting Sun and the Unknown — 
No more unknown. Ithobal's ships have sailed 
Around all Africa. Our Task is done ! 
These are the Pillars ! this the Midland Sea I 
The road to Tyre is yonder." 

Sir Edwin's blank verse is not distinguished, but it 
is fluent and vigorous. His poem is a creditable 
addition to the long list of his writings in verse. 

In the sequence of sonnets which he calls " The 
Oxford Year," Mr. James Williams sings the vari- 
ous charms which the changing seasons bring to the 
beautiful city where Thames and Cherwell meet in 
gentle confluence. The tribute is heartfelt, as 
almost any page will attest. 

" In thee I learned to love the toil that brings 
Forth from the treasured wisdom of the wise 
The truth that must be truth forevermore. 
In thee my soul first dared on golden wings 
Afar in empyrean realms to soar. 
And from the child first felt the man arise." 

In many other forms besides that of the sonnet are 
the praises of Oxford set forth by this graceful 
writer, its legendary past renewed, and its modern 
humors exploited. In his lighter vein Mr. Williams 
is not a little suggestive of Calverley, although his 
fun is not quite so riotous. These verses on Chaucer 
may serve to illustrate the author's grave fooling. 
It seems that Mr. Courthope, in one of his books, 
says that <' in one sense Chaucer is the poet of the 
schools." Whereby the author is thus inspired : 

" Fet«h me forth a cnp and saucer. 
Pour the coffee ere it cools. 
Let me drink the health of Chaucer, 
Poet of the Oxford schools. 

" Mr. Courthope with his far sight 
Revolutionizes ns. 
Gives us Palamon and Arcite, 
Obsolete is .^schylns. 

" Sophocles and Jebb are owls. 

Dug by Skeat their humble grave is. 
While the Parliament of Fowls 
Vengefally repeals the Aves. 

" But of all the change the best is 
That we lose Euripides, 
Hecuba, and with Alcestis 
His stout champion Heracles. 

" Gleefully through Moderations 

Passmen tread the primrose path, 
Scoring in examinations 
Triumph with the Wife of Bath. 

" Hand upon an English tiller 
All the stormy seas are past. 
Now the sumpnour and the miller 
Steer one safe to port at last," 

This is excellent satire, and a deep meaning lies 
beneath its surface. More reckless in its fun is 
such a piece as " How I Was Ploughed in Smalls," 
which thus begins : 



242 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



** We were rang^ed in long rows in those horrible halls. 
And the funk it was great though the papers were Smalls, 
And we wrote down a patois we called Latin Prose, 
Such as ' solus jam rosa,^ ' The sun now arose.' " 

Some of Mr. Wilson's things are amazingly clever, 
his Dantesque description of a football match, for 
example, and his " Oxford Horace," of which this 
is a specimen : 

" Fair child of mother scarce less fair, 
Go, cast these verses to the air, 
Or let the doggrel be 
The sport of flame or sea. 

" Thine anger overwhelms thee sore, 
No irate God or priest of yore. 
Not even Jupiter, 
Could make so great a stir. 

'"Twas anger dug Thyestes' tomb 
And caused full many a city's doom. 
And in the Schools ere now 
Oft drave the hostile plough. 

"To-day I'll get me down and fill 
The weary hours with golf until 
Cool tea again I get 
At Lady Margaret." 

The transition is a natural one from this Hora- 
tian imitation to " The Book of the Horace Club," 
which also comes to us from Oxford. Mr. Will- 
iams is a member of this Club, being reckoned 
among its " past Arbiters," and his associates in- 
clude such well-known writers as the Hon. A. M. 
Herbert, Professor F. York Powell, Mr. H. Belloc, 
Mr. Laurence Binyon, Mr. Humphry Ward, Mr. 
Owen Seaman, Sir Rennell Rodd, the Rev. H. C. 
Beeching, and Professor Courthope. Most of these 
writers, as well as others, are represented in the 
volume now published, the contents of which are 
written in English, French, Latin, and Greek. The 
poems are both grave and gay, Horatian by sug- 
gestion and finish rather than by imitation, and 
they include many charming pieces. Since we 
cannot represent all the writers, we are forced to 
make an invidious selection, and these verses by 
Mr. John Buchan must stand for the quality of the 
whole collection : 

" O Thou to whom man's heart is known. 
Grant me my morning orison. 
Grant me the rover's path — to see 
The dawn arise, the daylight flee, 
In the far wastes of sand and sun ! 
Grant me with venturous heart to run 
On the old highway where in pain 
And ecstasy man strives amain, 
Conquers his fellows, or, too weak, 
Finds the great rest which wanderers seek. 
Grant me the joy of wind and brine. 
The zest of food, the taste of wine, 
The fighter's strength, the echoing strife. 
The high tumultuous lists of life — 
May I ne'er lag, nor hapless fall, 
Nor weary at the battle-call. 
But when the even brings surcease 
Grant me the happy moorland peace ; 
That in my heart's depth ever lie 
That ancient land of heath and sky ; 
Where the old rhymes and stories fall 
In kindly, soothing pastoral. 



There in the hills grave silence lies, 
And Death himself wears friendly guise. 
There be my lot, my twilight stage. 
Dear city of my pilgrimage." 

Lady Lindsay has published several volumes of 
pleasing verse, and the last of them, now before us, 
is called " The Prayer of St. Scholastica, and Other 
Poems." Not only the title-poem, but a consider- 
able number of the others, are suggestions from 
the lives of the saints, as, for example, this sonnet 
upon " The Portiuncula " of St. Francis : 

" little house within a house of prayer — 
Thyself a sanctuary ! We softly tread 
Thy time-worn floor ; we stand with bended head 
Before thy walls where every stone 's more rare 
Than precious gems, for loving pilgrims there 
Have planed it smooth with kisses. Lies he dead. 
Or lives he yet ? Assisi's saint, who led 
Christ's barefoot band the Master's toil to share. 

" Here oft spake Francis, and his voice yet rings 
That called the swallows : ' little sisters dear.' 
Hard by, his cell with memories teems, and near 
Is the grey cave which saw him weep and pray. 
Where his soul wrestled, to the rosebush clings 
A stain of blood, as though of yesterday." 

Lady Lindsay writes lyrics and ballads, as well 
as religious verse ; it is all sincere in feeling, but 
rarely rises above the commonplace in expression. 
The " cycle of song " called " Heartsease " 
(anonymous, but clearly the work of a woman), 
fills a dainty little volume of about sixty pages. 
There are nearly as many songs as there are pages, 
which gives us free range for our illustrative ex- 
ample. " A Woman's Hope " seems to be one of 
the best of these graceful lyrics. 

" The sands of human trust run low. 
And life is all unrest ; 
But the faith that fades in the doubting mind 
Lies deep in a woman's breast. 

" The after-glow dies out of the skies, 
And fate like the sun is set ; 
But the light that goes from the golden world 
In a woman's soul lives yet. 

" The night-storm gathers o'er sea and land 
And Nature's heart beats high ; 
And the Storm-master is holding fast 
The love in a woman's sigh." 

Others of the songs strike a note of more passion- 
ate utterance, but the one we have quoted must do 
duty for the rest. 

Our first acquaintance with " The Lyric Library " 
is made through a booklet called " Song-Surf," by 
Mr. Cale Young Rice. It contains such things as 
this description of fate : 

" Nor fights she for the love of fight. 
Or vict'ry's valiant thrill ; 
But ghastly to God, and godless to man. 
Bemadded of haunting Chaos' den. 
She bursts thro' barriers good or ill 
With measureless maniac might." 

Mr. Young can write, on occasion, more intelligi- 
bly and melodiously than this, but we are inclined, 
on the whole, to dismiss his poems with a refer- 
I ence to 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



24S 



" The iiDiniti^ble dense yoid 
Of this abjsm, in which all things are cloyed 
And lost in nnremembered Nothingness " — 

A motto to which he cannot object, since it is of 
his own devising. 

A second volume of this " Library " is by Mr. 
Madison Cawein, and is called " One Day and 
Another." It turns out to be a re-publication, with 
considerable additions, of a volume called " Days 
and Dreams," which appeared some ten years ago. 
The poems of which the volume consists are con- 
nected by descriptive headlines so as to form, not 
exactly a continuous story, but a continuous account 
of the thoughts and moods of two lovers through 
the seasons of the year. The writer styles it " a 
lyrical eclogue." The maiden dies before the year 
is over, and the man is left to bear the winter with 
his g^ef. 

*' So long it seems since last I saw her face. 
So long ago ic seems. 

Like some sad sool in nnconjectnred space 
Still seeking happiness throngh perished grace 
And unrealities. — a little while 
Illosions lead me, ending in the smile 
Of Death triumphant in a thorny place 
Among Love's ruined roses and dead dreams." 

Mr. Cawein evidently writes too much to do him- 
self full justice. Rather richly endowed with the 
poetical temperament, and aiming at the sort of 
mastery attained by Keats and Tennyson, he is yet 
willing to publish much work that is unpolished. 
Throughout his pages one may find, side by side 
with passages of true and delicate inspiration, other 
passages that reveal hasty composition, to say noth- 
ing of infelicitous words and jarring rhymes. This 
statement is as true of the volume just mentioned, 
which the author has had ten years to revise, as of 
the new volume also in our hands upon the present 
occasion. But we always examine Mr. Cawein's 
work with pleasure, for every volume affords a few 
lyrics, at least, that are real additions to the wealth 
of our national song. Such a poem as '' Transub- 
stantiation," for example, may be criticized only 
upon the ground that there is little new in the 
imagery or the sentiment. It certainly is an ex- 
quisite poem. 

" A sunbeam and a drop of dew 
Lay on a red rose in the South : 
Ood took the three and made her moutli. 
Her sweet, sweet month, 
So red of hue, — 
The burning baptism of His kiss 
Still fills my heart with heavenly bliss. 

" A dream of truth and love come true 
Slept on a star in daybreak skies : 
God mingled these and made her eyes, 
Her dear, dear eyes. 
So gray of hue, — 
The high communion of His gaze 
Still fills my soul with deep amaze." 

Mr. Walter Malone appears to be a poet of 
Tennessee, and the dedication of his "Songfs of 
North and South " to Mr. Cawein betokens not 
merely personal friendship, but also a kindred in- 



spiration and a similar choice of themes. It must 
be said that this incessant cataloguing of vegeta- 
tion, and these impassioned tributes to various young 
women are rather cloying in their effect, and that 
we are glad when Mr. Malone gets away from his 
native South, as well as from his own sentimental 
experiences, and fi^nds other themes upon which to 
exercise his talents. These lines upon " A Western 
Plain " are fairly typical of his work, and as good 
as anything that we have been able to find in the 
volume. 

" A lonely white-washed farmhouse where I wait, 
A sweep of swirling cornfields, far and nigh, 
A flight of crows across a dreamy sky. 
Fast-fading morning-glories at the gate, 
A lonesome field-lark seeking for his mate. 
No hazy purple mountains meet the eye. 
No giant white-capped ocean thunders by. 
The land is quiet as the face of Fate. 
A craving for the moimtains and the sea, 
A pining and a waiting evermore ; 
A longing for the crags and cascades free, 
A yearning for the seaweeds of the shore ; 
A hopeless hope, on cloud-swept cliffs to be. 
To hear the stormy ocean billows roar." 

Unlike the work of his friend, Mr. Malone's pieces 
are frequently touched with social feeling, and have 
some outlook upon the larger world of men and 
events. 

The author of " The Book of Jade " is a modest 
person who does not reveal his name. From the 
gloom that hangs like a pall over his vaporings we 
judge that he is also a very young person. Bau- 
delaire is his model, and he sings of charnel-house 
subjects in measures that would have startled even 
the poet of the " Fleurs du Mai." 

" I love all sombre and autumnal things," he 
tells us, 

" Regal and wonderful and funereal. 
Things strange and curious and majestical. 
Whereto a solemn savor of death clings ; 
Coemlian serpents, mark'd with azure rings ; 
Awful cathedrals where rich shadows fall ; 
Hoarse symphonies sepulchral as a pall. 
Mad crimes adomM with bestial blazonings." 

We have sought to realize the image of that last 
line, but it is beyond our powers of imagination. 
Perhaps the writer is making fun of as after all. 
We get a horrid suspicion that this is the case 
when we read his sonnet entitled '' Ennui," and 
come to its petulant close. 

" I sat in tall Gomorrah on a day. 
Boring myself with solitude and dreams. 
When, like strange priests, with sacerdotal tread. 
The seven mortal sins, in rich array, 

Came in and knelt : one old. and weak, and gray, 
One that was shrouded like a person dead. 
And one whose robes cast reddish-purple gleams 
Upon her scornful face at peace alway. 

They swung before me amischirs of strange gold. 
And one most beautiful began to pray. 
Dreamily garmented in pallid blue. 

But I said only, — I have dream'd of you. 
Naught really is ; all things are very old, 
And very foolish. Please to go away."

And when we come to the end of the volume, we 
even have doubts of the author's modesty, for he 
describes his own work as 

" These paltry rhymes which loftier shall pursue 
Than aught America of high or great 
Hath seen since first began her world-wide State." 

If American poetry is to have its school of deca- 
dents, this ingenious writer sets them a pace that 
they will find it diflficult to keep. 

In looking over " The Dead Calypso, and Other 
Verses," Mr. L. A. Robertson's volume of poems, 
one balks a little at such a title as " When Lulu 
Comes," and a little more at such futile artifice as 
is exhibited in the sonnet on " Golgotha," which 
works a sacred phrase, letter by letter, into the 
fabric of the verse. But these suggestions do not 
afford an adequate measure of Mr. Robertson's 
talent for serious composition, which is undeniable. 
And yet a sort of sturdy good sense, rather than 
poetic inspiration, seems to be the most befitting 
phrase with which to characterize his work. Take 
for example the double ballade, "The Man Is Noth- 
ing, the Work Is All," of which this is a specimen 
stanza : 

" To some misleading guides we owe 

Lights that have made us retrograde ; 
While others up Time's ramparts throw 
For us a shining escalade, 
By which we shall at last invade, 
Truth's glorious and eternal hall ; 

Or fair or foul, in Life's crusade, 
The man is nothing, the work is all." 

The expression here is rather prosaic than poetic, 
and many others of the pieces would require the 
same comment. The sentiment of the following 
lines is excellent, but their manner is that of the 
journalist at work upon a leader. 

" These mongrel miscreants from o'er the sea 
Would any country, any cause betray. 
As witness our own Civil War, when they 

In scores of thousands from the flag did flee. 

Let everlasting shame be ours if we 
Should in one balance their black perjuries weigh 
'Gainst England's friendship." 

We have read with much satisfaction the sonnet on 
that very unpoetical subject, " Dialect Verse," 
which thus concludes : 

" The poor provincial's patois may be strong 
With the rude eloquence that stirs the soul ; 
But when in raucous rhyme, or senseless song. 

The uncouth verbs and nouns together roll 
In tangled tropes — then must I turn away. 
And let the yokel's sponsor have his say." 

But this excellent literary criticism seems to lose, 
rather than gain, by being couched in the forms of 
verse. 

The " Poems " of Mr. James B. Kenyon are 
concerned mostly with religious sentiment and the 
domestic life. They are always tastefully com- 
posed, and sometimes have a touch of the exquisite. 
"In the Market-Place" is a fair example. 
" Muse, we have piped, but none have danced, 
And now we sit in the market-place, 
(While the shadows of noon on the flags lie tranced), 
With idle fingers and drooping face. 



" Why should we vex our souls to send 

Our laboring breath through the hollow reed ? 
No ears are charmed, save those that bend 
To scrannel straws at the lips of greed. 

" Come, let us rise from these sordid ways ; 

Let us flee to the conscious woods and streams, 
And though we have fallen on evil days. 
We will dwell apart and keep our dreams." 

One of Mr. Kenyon's pieces voices the desire for 
the appearance of " The New Poet." 

" He comes not, though we tarry long ; 
He comes not — and the noon is near ; 
The anxious world awaits his song ; 
Men hush their very hearts to hear." 

Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles, in his volume 
called "On Life's Stairway," has in mind the same 
thought of the new poet who is one day to appear. 
" When the tunesters of our time 
Learn to live before they rhyme, 
Burn their sonnets to a star. 
Love the brown earth where they are " — 

When these things, and several others, shall come 
to pass, then the new poet will find his opportunity. 
" He shall stand — with brow of flame. 
As the Hebrew prophets came, 
Shouting, as he smites the string, 
' In Jehovah's name I sing I ' " 

Meanwhile, the case of our poets is parlous, and 

evokes the following adjuration : 

"O juggler with the fire divine, 
O hoarder of God's bread and wine, 
Your dark and doleful sprigs of verse 
Nod like the plumes above a hearse." 

This is a very fair description of more than one of 
the writers reviewed in the present article, but it 
does not apply to Mr. Knowles, whose utterance is 
usually sane and robust. At his prettiest, he can 
write verse like this : 

" O rose, climb up to her window 

And in through the casement reach. 
And say what I may not utter 
In your beautiful silent speech I 

" She will shake the dew from your petals, 
She will press you close to her lips, 
She will hold you never so lightly 
In her warm white finger-tips. 

" And then — who can tell ? — she may whisper 

(While the city sleeps below), 
' I was dreaming of him when you woke me. 
But, rose, he must never know.' " 

" The Glass of Time " is a very small volume of 
sonnets and songs by Miss Charlotte Becker. Her 
careful workmanship may be illustrated by " Lin- 
gua Toscana." 

" With tender reverence the dying sun 
Haloes in golden peace the ancient ways 
Where treasured shrines bear witness to the days 
When art and beauty knew their laurels won 
By noble, fearless souls, whose race was run 
With dreams alone ; who trod life's wondrous maze 
Through trails of glowing color — but to gaze 
On other dreams more perfect, yet undone. 
Down dusky street and narrow winding lane, 
The music of dead greatness fills the air 
With happy melody, half kin to tears — 
Even as Tuscan eyes are sad with pain. 
But Tuscan lips, through centuries of care. 
Laugh with the gayest laughter down the years! " 



1901.]

Miss Becker's themes are of old-world scenes, and 
classical motives intermingle with Alpine remi- 
niscences. The verse is almost uniformly pleasing, 
and frequently touches the deeper chords of feeling. 
Last upon our list comes " A Rose of Dawn," 
by Miss Helen Hay. This is a tragic idyl, in blank 
verse, of love and jealousy in the South Sea islands. 
It tells of 

"The land 
Where history is but a charming tale 
Droned by old men at twilight, future days 
Pleasantly certain as the next repast, 
Where gods and goddesses appear as birds. 
Trees, plants, or moonlight, gently rising tide. 
And shining girdle of leaves, — all homely things. 
Which hold the people's hearts." 

The poem is a rather slight performance, and its 
sentiment seems a little sophisticated ; but the story 
is clearly told, and the metrical form is managed 
with much skill. William Morton Patnb. 



Briefs on New Books. 

Vital problem* ^®^ books SO well deserve reading 
ofEngiuh as "The Heart of the Empire " (T. 

life andpoiuics. > pigher Unwin), a work from various 
hands, which deals with the shortcomings of modern 
civilization as exhibited in the English cities, 
London in particular. Wholly free from chau- 
vinism and national self-opinionation, the several 
authors have brought to their task unusually clear 
vision and calm minds. Failures to grapple with 
the crying questions of the day by legislatures and 
that better class which sets the fashion in legislation, 
are discussed and dissected by a critical method 
which is never timid and yet never merely destruc- 
tive. In the same breath with a merciless arraign- 
ment of methods may be found a putting forth of 
remedial agents, these in turn to meet with approval 
or condemnation in the light of fuller knowledge 
and comprehension. To do all this from a practical 
point of view, with a freedom from the methods of 
the doctrinaire as rare as it is delightful, is the final 
merit of a work which is the more certain to meet 
with condemnation, either loud or tacit, from the very 
conviction which must follow its unprejudiced pe- 
rusal. The Preface of this interesting and valuable 
production gives the note of the whole in announc- 
ing that the Victorian Era has passed, ♦• that new 
problems [are] were arising with a new age," and 
that something more must be done than " to con- 
front the evils of national life with the old remedies." 
In all the papers following, it is noteworthy that 
the essayists are men with university degrees, four 
of them being fellows of one or another college in 
Cambridge University, and five of them engaged in 
University Settlement work or activities of similar 
nature. Within the limits of this criticism it must 
suffice to give the titles of the respective treatises and 
the names of their authors, with the statement that 
the work throughout, whether in manner or matter, 



is homogeneous and logically interrelated. " Reali- 
ties at Home," by Mr. Charles F. C Masterman, 
M.A., deals with the general problem of poverty in 
London, and finds there the reason for the change 
of the phlegmatic Englishman of tradition into the 
inflammable neurotic of recent London mobs ; " The 
Housing Problem," by Mr. F. W. Lawrence, M.A., 
" The Children of the Town," by Mr. Reginald A. 
Bray, B.A., " Temperance Reform," by Messrs. 
Noel Buxton, B.A., and Walter Hoare, " The Dis- 
tribution of Industry," by Mr. P. Whitwell Wilson, 
B. A., " Some Aspects of the Problem of Charity," 
by Mr. A. C Pigou, B.A., and " The Church and 
the People," by Mr. F. W. Head, M.A., explain 
themselves. Then follows an important paper on 
"Imperialism," by Mr. G. P. Grooch, M.A., which 
contains not only the best summary of recent world 
movements and by far the most enlightening review 
of the South African war and its antecedent causes, 
but also a word or two to Americans which deserve 
to be learned by heart. " The descendants of the 
men who fought and died for the right to live their 
own national life under their own flag," Mr. Gooch 
observes, "now explain that when the authors of the 
Declaration of Independence declared government 
to derive its authority from the consent of the gov- 
erned, they only meant ' the probable consent of the 
governed at some future time ' [quoting Professor 
Giddings on ' Democracy and Empire '], the gov- 
ernors themselves being judges of the probability. 
And the politics are worthy of the logic. The 
Philippine War goes far to cancel the debt of liberty 
that the world owes to the United States." The 
volume closes with " The Past and the Future," by 
Mr. G. M. Trevelvan, M.A., a survey, acute and 
discriminating, of what England was, what she ex- 
pects to become, and what the hope is for her con- 
tinued existence as a moral force. It is significant 
in this last connection that the great English univer- 
sities should grapple with problems of the vital 
significance of these in such a book as this. 

Viewi of ^® *^° ^°* suppose that even a dis- 

18th century cussion, or rather a resumi of the 

family life. discussions, Concerning the "Letters 

of Junius" will make Sir Philip Francis a person 
of literary note once more. Nor was Francis him- 
self, in his private capacity, an especially agree- 
able letter-writer. But "The Francis Letters, by 
Sir Philip Francis and other members of the 
Family " (Dutton) is a good book notwithstanding. 
It is edited by Beata Francis and Eliza Keary, and 
although it has a " Note on the Junius Controversy 
by Dr. C F. Keary," its real value consists in the 
great abundance of letters by the various ordinary 
members of the Francis family, which give us many 
good side-lights on English life in the second half 
of the eighteenth century. The most amusing letter- 
writer of all is Mr. Alexander Mackrabie, the 
brother of Lady Francis. It is true that this 
opinion comes in part from the fact that Mackrabie 
spent a number of years in America just before the

Revolutionary War. We are naturally interested 
in his remarks that "the people have all too violent 
principles of independence," that New York was a 
better place than Philadelphia for company and 
amusements, though Philadelphia was more public- 
spirited ; that the climate was so variable that you 
could wear cloth clothes in the morning, at noon sit 
in your shirt with door or window open, and want 
a fur cloak at night ; that if the Americans were not 
so hospitable they would grow immensely rich "too 
rich, mon ami, for your system of American 
politics"; and a hundred other matters. But it is 
not merely Mackrabie's American letters that are 
amusing: when he went with Sir Philip to India 
he did not lose his gift of wit and ease. Francis 
himself is a bit commonplace by comparison;' still 
he appears in quite as excellent a light when we 
read that in India " in an age and country of corrup- 
tion, with every opportunity of enriching himself at 
the expense of the Indian public, he preserved his 
hands and his conscience clean." There is much 
other good meat in the book : Burke defends his 
"Age of Chivalry is past and gone"; Godishall 
Johnson affirms that in the war times at Oxford he 
saw a Doctor of Divinity knock down an under- 
graduate with his musket ; Francis tells of his elec- 
tion to Parliament for the ancient borough of Ap- 
pleby Castle by the one elector, " after which a great 
dinner at the castle." In fact, the book is on the 
whole very interesting to those who like to read 
memoirs and letters for the view they give of the 
conditions of life of our fathers. 



True and false 
ute in Englith 



In "Word and Phrase" (McClurg), 
Mr. Joseph Fitzgerald has made an 
interesting contribution to the sub- 
ject of true and false use in English. Like Richard 
Grant White, William Dwight Whitney, George P. 
Marsh, and other predecessors in the same field, 
Mr. Fitzgerald treats language as one of the natural 
sciences, and one by no means inferior in interest 
and importance to any other whatsoever. But 
both as to matter and manner, he strikes out in a 
path of his own and is in no sense a follower of 
these older writers. He takes a middle route be- 
tween the purists on the one hand who would have 
the language put under the absolute rule of Author- 
ity without appeal, as is done by the French Acad- 
emy; and the philological anarchists on the other, 
who defy all law, and maintain that in language 
whatever is, is right. Mr. Fitzgerald believes that 
the voluntary acquiescence of the people, ruled by 
the classic writers of their language, is the saving 
element of correct speech. Moreover, he declines 
to accept the authority of England as superior to 
our own. In such cases as the effort of the English 
to restrict the meaning of the word " sickness " to 
nausea, he calls attention to the fact that it is an 
effort of finical connoisseurs, and entirely at vari- 
ance with their own best usage, adding: " The Anglic 
people in their several divisions are really or virtu- 
ally autonomous as regards their use of the langu- 



age, and they are not subject to the language laws 
that may be enacted in the isle oversea." This 
is a Declaration of Independence that will be ac- 
ceptable to many like-minded Americans. Some 
of the most suggestive passages of the book are 
those in which the English is compared with other 
languages, though here one may not always agree. 
Especially, we must protest against such a sweep- 
ing conclusion as that the German language is 
easier to master than the English, because its vo- 
cabulary is more homogeneous. This is to take a 
most partial and puerile view of what is meant by 
"knowing " a language. Indeed, the author grants 
this himself on an earlier page by saying, " He who 
learns no more of a language than the child learns 
will remain in mental stature a child." The section 
devoted to "Some Faults and Excellencies of En- 
glish " is one of great discrimination and even 
originality, the superiorities and the failings of our 
tongue being pointed out with equal candor. In a 
work devoted to corectness of diction it is a pity 
that the first page of the Preface should offer 
an example of such awkward and incorrect writing 
as this: "No article, except two or three, was 
published in the Forum in its first four or five 
years that was not corrected or revised before it 
went to the compositor." But such slips as this 
are not frequent. There is so much animation of 
style, such fertility and aptness in illustration, that 
not a page in the whole four hundred that make up 
the volume is dull reading. 

The American ^**®^ '^^ Y^^^^ ^^ usef ul existence 
" WhoU Who " in its first edition, " Who 's Who in 
inrevuedform. America" appears in revised and 
enlarged form (Marquis). The new volume has 
been prepared by Mr. John W. Leonard, under 
whose competent editorship the venture was first 
undertaken. The pages are now increased by about 
fifty per cent, and the names included are increased 
from 8,602 to 11,651. Since over seven hundred 
of the old names have been dropped, for death or 
other reasons, there are nearly four thousand new 
biographies. As for the old biographies, nearly all 
have been revised and brought down to the present 
year. The special features of the new edition are 
the statement of parentage wherever possible, and 
the very complete lists of the publications of the 
many writers included. It seems from a comparison 
of the two editions that three per cent is the annual 
mortality among men and women of achieved repu- 
tation. Since there can be few people included 
who are under forty years of age, this mortality is 
not as alarming as it first appears. Rear Admiral 
Selfridge (1804) has the distinction of being the 
oldest American of distinction now living, while 
Miss Margaret Potter (1881) and Miss Mary Antin 
(1883) are the youngest. The present addresses 
of the subjects are given in almost every case, a 
matter which has involved enormous labor, and for 
which readers cannot be too thankful. One man 
testified that through the agency of this book " he

had been enabled to open correspondence with a 
score of college friends whose addresses he had 
sought in vain for years." The statistics of birth 
and present residence by States are extremely inter- 
esting, New York leading both lists, with Massa- 
ehasett« second, and Pennsylvania third. After 
these States and the District of Columbia, comes 
Illinois in the figares denoting present residence, 
although it has to be content with the eighth place 
in the figures for birth. About eleven per cent of 
the subjects are foreign born. No one of distinc- 
tion seems to have been born thus far in Alaska, 
Arizona, Oklahoma, Wyoming, or the Dakotas. 
We might fill a page more with the interesting 
facts and deductions which this work brings into 
view, but space forbids us to do more than conclude 
this notice with an enthusiastic commendation of 
the publication, and a tribute to the painstaking 
industry that has made it one of the most indis- 
pensable of all books of reference. 



Amethier aecontmt 
the Iron Matk. 



Another book on " The Man in the 
Iron Mask " is the patient work of 
Mr. Tighe Hopkins, whose researches 
have been confined with some strictness to the ro- 
mantically historic. But though he comes to no new 
conclusion in the matter, which was long ago taken 
from the field of vexed questions, he marshals his 
facts in a manner that takes the romance out of this 
famous story and leaves it a commonplace instance 
of the old French commonplace despotism. After 
discussing all the various myths and fables that have 
grown up around the reality, the author proceeds 
to his demonstration of the identification of the Man 
in the Iron Mask with one Ercole Antonio Matioli, 
born in Bologna on December 1, 1640, of an old 
and distinguished family of lawyers. He grew to 
be a favorite of the young Charles IV., Duke of 
Mantua, and aided that princeling in negotiating 
the sale of the important fortress of Casale to Louis 
XIV. of France. But Matioli played double, and 
betrayed the confidence and plans of le roi soleil in 
a manner that earned the enduring displeasure of 
that self-centred tyrant. Biding his time, Louis 
cajoled Matioli into custody, and in the strictest 
custody he remained, condemned without the un- 
needed formalities of a trial, until death put an end 
to his discomforts in the Bastile, to which he had 
finally been removed, on November 19, 1703. The 
story of this unfortunate man is told interestingly 
and with much vivacity, though it must be confessed 
the truth is not so fascinating as the lies which have 
been told, though doubtless equally strange. Re- 
productions of many portraits embellish the book, 
which is handsomely printed and bound. (Scribner.) 



Thediteate 
tf life in 
freat eitiei. 



Men of letters are not, or at least 
were not, commonly regarded as 
very practical people, at least by no 
means so practical as hard-headed lawyers or scien- 
tific doctors. Their opinions or exertions in law or 
medicine would rarely be matters of interest. But 



when a lawyer or a doctor turns to letters, the boot 
may be on the other leg. Thus a judge condescends 
to show by evidence that would convince a court of 
law that Shakespeare's sonnets were not written 
by Shakespeare, and the absolute lack of interest 
with which his decision is greeted shows the value 
of his labors. We have now in " Newyorkitis " 
(Grafton Press), by Dr. John H. Girdner, a hand- 
ling of a social topic by a literary method, namely, 
satire. If a doctor who lived in Chicago observed 
that his townsmen, on nearing the age of fifty, were 
apt to be getting bald, and wrote a medical treatise 
called " Chicagoitis " tending to show that the living 
in Chicago caused people to lose their hair, he 
would in some respects resemble Dr. Girdner. 
For with all the display of technical language and 
method, this treatment of Newyorkitis amounts to 
nothing more than a statement of some of the 
general characteristics of a plutocratic civilization. 
Some people in New York have these characteris- 
tics, just as some people in Chicago are bald. The 
disease is more common in New York than else- 
where, only because New York is the largest of our 
gre&t cities. So one need not expect in this book 
any particular cleverness in diagnosing the specific 
difficulties of New York. We find in this treatise 
little that has not been noted by the satirists of all 
times. And we may add that in offering a cure 
Dr. Girdner does not get much farther than when 
he describes the disease. "Culture," says he, "in 
its widest signification." We do not believe that he 
is mistaken. But it is probable that if he would 
indulge more largely in his own specific, he would 
learn that something more than a word, even in a 
very broad sense, is needed for the serious conditions 
he has in mind. 

Thehumort ^° Concluding the introduction to 

oj EngixA " A Student's Pastime " in 1896, the 

etymotcgy. Reverend Walter W. Skeat, LittD., 

took occasion to say, " If the reception of the pres- 
ent book is sufficiently encourag^ing, it will be easy 
to produce another volume, or even two more, of a 
like kind." The reception was sufficiently encour- 
aging, and now we have " Notes on English Etymo- 
logy" (Frowde), a volume of like kind, for the 
delectation of those who like to know about the 
bones of the language, whether living or dry. This 
latter volume is similiar in content to the former, 
but it is successful in omitting, partially at least, the 
didacticism of its predecessor, and being of more 
general interest. It is supplementary both to the 
Etymological Dictionary from the same hand and 
to Dr. Murray's New English Dictionary, and at the 
same time it contains the material gleaned in many 
fields of diverse application. No one unfamiliar 
with Professor Skeat at his best could prophesy the 
amount of humor which can be set in such discus- 
sions as arise here, — this, for example : " Wallop, 
to castigate. This is merely the causal use of the 
M. E. toalopen, to gallop. We speak of galloping a 
horse, t. e., making him gallop ; and the way to en-

sure his doing so is to use the whip freely. The 
verb to wallop is also used with reference to the 
boiling of a pot ; this likewise is only a particular 
use of the same M. E. walopen, to gallop. The 
rapid boiling of the pot is compared to the galloping 
of a horse. Hence also pot-walloper, one who boils 
a pot." And so on, for half a page more. In ad- 
dition to the " Notes," the work contains chapters 
on the language of Mexico, on words from the lan- 
guages of Brazil, Peru, and the West Indies, a 
rough list of English words taken over into Norman 
French, and some observations on Anglo-French 
spelling. The book is bound uniformly with its 
predecessor. May the promised third volume not 
be long delayed ! 

In the Introduction to his five hun- 
dred-page volume on " The Founda- 
tions of Knowledge" (Macmillan), 
Prof. A. T. Ormond states that " some fundamental 
reconsideration of the whole problem of Philosophy 
will be one of the first duties of the century upon 
which the world is about to enter." After a brief 
survey and criticism, in the Introduction, of the 
intellectual movements of the past century, the 
author takes up the task of construction. The book 
is divided into three parts, "Ground Concepts 
of Knowledge," "Evolution of the Categories of 
Knowledge," and " The Transcendent Factor in 
Knowledge." In the first part, the notion of ex- 
perience is subjected to a careful analysis, and is 
distinguished from consciousness, knowledge, and 
reality ; and the problem of epistemology is set forth. 
In the second part, the clear distinction drawn be- 
tween perceptual and conceptual space and time, 
and the discussion of the subject-consciousness, may 
be especially mentioned ; while the third part shows 
that the trancendent is necessarily present in ex- 
perience, and that, without concepts which involve 
the transcendent, science is unable to escape 
from the internal instability of the relative and 
achieve a stable basis of certitude. The functions 
of mysticism and symbolism in knowledge are also 
discussed in a masterly way, and the bearing of the 
general conclusion upon ethics and religion is traced 
out. The work is scholarly throughout, and while 
controversy is avoided, "the whole effort," as the 
auther says, "may be regarded as a plea for the 
rights of the spiritual and for the reality of spirit- 
ual knowledge."

life of Ulysses S. Grant in the 
" Beacon Biographies " (The Dial, February 16, 
1901, page 112) applies with equal force to Mr. 
Walter Allen's compendious story of the life of the 
soldier-president in the " Riverside Biographical 
Series" (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). With entire 
sympathy for the great good in the man, yet with- 
out the slightest condolence for the evil his political 
career wrought to the nation, with a complete un- 



derstanding of the virtue which steadfastness toward 
friends implies, yet with no denial of the fact that 
Grant made it a vice by carrying it beyond con- 
siderations of public duty, Mr. Allen has given an 
unusually accurate and significant portrait of a 
national hero, who with feet of clay could still lay 
claim to something of the stature of a god. Mr. 
Allen's is a book to be read and pondered over; 
seldom does any biography contain an equal share 
of plain unvarnished truth. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The popular series of reprints entitled the " Handy 
Volume Classics," published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell 
& Co., is increased this year by seven new volumes. 
The titles are as follows: "Aurora Leigh," by Mrs. 
Browning; " Unto this Last," by John Ruskin; "The 
Oregon Trail," by Francis Parkman; a volume of "His- 
torical Essays " by Macaulay; Southey's "Life of Nel- 
son "; Bacon's " Essays "; and Lowell's youthful but still 
charming volume of " Conversations on Old Poets," 
Each of these volumes has a special critical Introduc- 
tion by a competent hand, Professor E. G. Bourne 
writing of Parkman, Professor R. T. Ely writing of 
Ruskin, and Mr. W. H. Hudson writing of Bacon. 

" The American Jewish Year Book " for 5662 
(1901-02), edited by Dr. Cyrus Adler, is the third 
annual issue of that useful work of reference. It leaves 
out the directories of the previous issues, as well as the 
bibliography of Jewish periodicals, and new matter is 
provided for the vacated space. An account of the 
Jewish situation in Roumania is a noticeable feature of 
the new volume, and the list of references to the Jew- 
ish books and articles of the year is upon a larger scale 
than hitherto. The work bears the imprint of the Jew- 
ish Publication Society of America. 

A striking illustration of the attention now paid to 
the needs of children in our public libraries is aflPorded 
by the " Index to St. Nicholas " which has been com- 
piled by Miss Harriet Goss and Miss Gertrude A. 
Baker, and published at Cleveland by the Cumulative 
Index Co. The work is a dictionary catalogue of the 
contents of twenty-seven volumes of "St. Nicholas," 
and the expert hands that have prepared it have done 
their work in accordance with the best modern practice 
in indexing. Something like twenty thousand articles 
are catalogued, and librarians, at least, will appreciate 
the magnitude of the undertaking and the usefulness 
of the work. 

Dr. John Rae's work on " Contemporary Socialism " 
(Scribner) was first published in 1884. Ten years ago 
it reappeared in a secoud edition, considerably enlarged, 
and now a third edition, with important additions, is 
placed before the public. The new matter of the third 
edition takes the form of a chapter of about fifty pages 
upon the historical development during the past decade 
of the various movements that are roughly grouped 
under the general name of socialism. The German 
developments are particularly noteworthy, although 
they by no means occupy the entire field. The work is 
distinctly the most sober, scientific, and interesting 
treatment of its subject now accessible to the English- 
reading public.

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," "Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and " Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

Fleming H. Revell Company Announcement 

JAMES M. LUDLOW 

Deborah. a Tale of the Times of Judas Maccabaeus. By the author of «The Captain of the 

Janizaries." 12n]o, cloth, illustrated, $1.50. 

A thrilling romance of a thrilling time, inTolving the career of Judas Maccabaeus, the chief hero of the Jewish nation, who is 
counted as one of the seven greatest uncrowned men of human history. The four battles in which this peasant chieftain rescued his 
land from the Syrian monarchy are regarded by military critics as masterpieces of strategy. They are vividly and picturesquely de- 
scribed with that brilliant oriental coloring which won for the author his reputation through his earlier works. The martyr patience of the 
Jewish patriots, the sweet home-life of the people, the intrigues of priests and diplomacy of princes, are inwoven with a story of love as 
delicate as it is strong. Deborah, the heroine, is the creation of a character, strange yet true to its type, which fascinates the reader and 
enriches the imagination of those who love the truly beautiful and heroic. It is a book which provides rarest entertainment while moving 
among the highest ideals. The publishers submit this work to the public, confident that it will be a valued contribution to the richest lit- 
erature of the day. Of the author's style we subjoin the opinion of a few eminent critics : " Of that rich oriental character which fires the 
fancy." "Straightforward, almost in the great style of Scott." "Some of the finest pieces of historical fiction ever produced in America." 

ARTHUR H. SMITH 

Author of << Chinese Characteristics," <* Village Life in China." 

China in Convulsion. The Origin, The Outbreak, The Climax, The Aftermath, A Survey 
of the Cause and Events of the Recent Uprising. Very fully illustrated, with numerous maps and 
charts. Two volumes. 8vo, cloth, $5.00 net. 

Not only was Dr. Smith in Peking during the siege, but he has resided in the district most affected for the past thirty years. He 
made a close study of the inception of the movement in the centre of " Boxerdom," and after the siege was raised, in spite of tempting 
allurements to return home, he preferred to remain on the field of action so as to study the new conditions at close range and complete 
this record. 

"China in Convulsion," therefore, is written by a man unequaled in his qualification to convey to the West a conception of the 
tremendous upheaval in the East. The five or six hundred pages sum up in a graphic way all the essential events leading up to the 
catastrophe, as well as the better known occurences of last year; salient incidents of the war not generally known, thrilling stories of 
massacre, and narrow escapes from death, and striking facts connected with the pacification. It will be elaborately illustrated from 
hitherto unpublished photographs, and will contain several very valuable maps. It is safe to predict that this book will be recognized at 
once as an authoritative record of the Chinese outrage, and as such will become the standard work on the subject. 



W. A. P. MARTIN 

Author of « The Cycle of Cathay." 

The Lore of Cathay, in five parts: 

Arts and Sciences, Literature, Philosophy and 
Religion, Education, History. By the President 
of the Imperial University. Illustrated, $2.50 net. 

While " Cycle of Cathay " exhibits the people of China, this 
companion volume is a mirror of their intellectual life. In every 
branch of the subject the material is drawn exclusively from na- 
tive sources. Nothing has been included which is not worthy of 
preservation as a result of original researches. As the internat- 
ional law and diplomacy of the ancient Chinese were unearthed by 
Dr. Martin, so he may fairly claim to have thrown fresh light on 
their literature, science, and philosophy. 

" He is one of the scholarly Americans, who, whether as mis- 
sionaries, teachers, diplomatists, or educators, have shed lustre 
upon the name of the United States. If one were to erase from 
the record of American negotiations with China, or of American 
scholarship in things Chinese, the names of missionaries, then our 
country's record in the Middle Kingdom would be scarcely higher 
than that of a semi-barbarous nation. . . . Dr. Martin, as the head 
of the college created by the Chinese Foreign Office, learned at 
first hand what he describes, and his story is a modest narrative 
of things seen and known." — T/ie Critic. 



HENRY OTIS DWIQHT 
Constantinople and Its Prob= 

lems. Its Peoples, Customs, Religion, and 
Progress. Fully illustrated. 12mo, $1.25 net. 

Most writers on the Queen City of the Levante content them- 
selves with its topography and political history. The inner life of 
its heterogeneous and picturesque population, their habits, 
thoughts, motives, environment are a sealed book. Tet after all, 
this is the real Constantinople, and it is to it that Dr. Dwight in- 
troduces the reader. Turk, Armenian, Greek, Bulgarian, Jew, 
Arab, and the less-known Levantine, each find their place in the 
panorama, and contribute their share to the social and religious 
ideas, and national and commercial influences which are at the 
foundation of Constantinople's power, not merely in Turkey, but 
in the world, and which make it so important as a Missionary centre. 

CoNTSNTS — Introduction; Chap. I., The City as a Centre of a 
World; Chap. II., The Mohammedan Question; Chap. III., The 
Woman Question; Chap. IV., The Oriental Church; Chap. V., Outside 
Influences at Constantinople; Chap. VI., A Half Utilized Agency. 

"Dr. Dwight has had continuous and exceptional opportunity 
to become acquainted with life in Constantinople, both in its higher 
and more commonplace aspects. What he has to say in his forth- 
coming volume will be authoritative, free from amateur sentimen- 
talism, sane, straightforward, and up-to-date. He has lived there in 
peace and war, as a keen observer of the intricacies of its political 
and social life, and an active worker for the promotion of its higher 
interests." — Jamet S. DennU. 



FRANKLIN WELLES CALKINS 

My Host, the Enemy, and other Tales. Sketches of Life and Adventure on the Border 
Line of the West. Fully illustrated. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1,50. 

These tales of a borderman are fresh and crisp and intensely interesting. For the most part the scenes are laid in the French- 
Canadian and Indian settlements of our great Northwest. The stories are full of the wild, free air of the prairie, the scent of the forest, 
and not infrequently is heard the whoop of the Indian, but the blending is good and the moral helpful. 

CoNTKNTS — My Host, the Enemy; Our Celebration at Two-Owe-Tee; The Picked Seven at Hat Band; A Pair of Chapparejos; The

The Cavalier 

With spirited illustrations 
by 

Howard Chandler Christy. 

The New York Tribune says: 
**TT is packed with incident, 
1 with a soldier's adventures, 
but each detail is deftly adjusted 
to a single aim, which is to carry 
certain lovers and their sweethearts 
through thrilling and unhappy 
times to joyous peace. We are 
grateful to the author for his vivid 
picture of Confederate camp life 
and fighting. But we are most 
grateful to him for a romance 
which in interest and in literary 
quality is one of the best things 
he has ever produced.'*

The 

Ruling Passion 

With eight drawings in 

color by 

Walter Appleton Clark. 

IN this book, the highest accomplishment 
of Dr. van Dyke's literary career, the 
ruling passion is shown in its season of em- 
pire over a few lives. 

In almost all lives romantic love has its 
season. But there are other passions no less 
real. Music, nature, honor, strife, revenge, 
pride, loyalty, duty — to these and others 
the secret power of personal passion often 
turns and the life unconsciously follows it. 

To tell something about these ruling pas- 
sions, simply, clearly, and concretely, is Dr. 
van Dyke's object.

FIVE IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS 

FROM A. C. MCCLURG & CO.'S FALL LIST 



A BOOK OF LITERARY SIGNIFICANCE. 

A History of American Verse 

Bv James L. Onderdonk. iimo, pp. 395, 

^1.2 J net ; delivered, $i.j8. 

Mr. Onderdonk was a constant contributor to 
newspapers and literary journals up to the time of his 
death in 1899. During his entire life he made a close 
study of American literature, and this book represents 
the definite results of his extended researches. He 
has covered his subject from the primitive efforts of 
one of the Jamestown Colony in 1610 to the close 
of the Nineteenth Century. His book is sufficiently 
comprehensive and scholarly to satisfy the most ex- 
acting student of American literature. 



A VALUABLE WORK ON ENGLISH. 

Word and Phrase 

True and False Use ik English. By 
Joseph Fitzgerald. 121110,^7.^5 net; 
delivered, $i.j8. 

During the author's editorial work on " The North 
American Review" and "The Forum," he made 
many notes on the use of words and phrases, and the 
present work is the result. It will be found a most 
novel and interesting book on the subject, with many 
new ideas and much original thought. 

" There is so much animation of style, such fertility and apt- 
ness In illustration, that not a page in the whole four hundred that 
make up the rolume is dull reading." — The Dial, October 1. 



A NEW EDITION COMPLETE TO DATE OF 

Henrik Ibsen 

A Critical Biography. By Henrik. J.ffiGER. Translated by William Morton Payne. 
With an additional chapter by Mr. Payne covering the poet's later life ; a frontispiece 
from a new portrait, and other illustrations. i2mo, pp. 315,^7.50 net; delivered, ^/. (5^. 
Mr. William Morton Payne was probably the first American reader, not Scandinavian by descent, to 
become acquainted with Ibsen's work. He has borne in this country the same pioneer relation to Ibsen 
criticism that Mr. Edmund Gosse has borne in England, and is recognized as the most competent Ibsen critic 
in America. It is fitting, therefore, that he should be the one to introduce Ibsen to a larger circle of Amer- 
ican readers, through his excellent translation of the work of Henrik Jaeger. This book has for some time 
been out of print, owing to the destruction of the remaining copies by fire. Since it is the standard English 
work upon its subject, a new edition has been greatly needed, and the present one will be thoroughly appre- 
ciated. Mr. Payne has written a supplementary' chapter which gives an analysis of the six plays that Ibsen 
has produced since Jaeger's book was written. 



A LOVE IDYLL OF RARE CHARM. 

Nanna 

A Story of Danish Love. Translated from 

the Danish of Holger Drachmann. 

With Introductorv Note by Francis F. 

Browne. i6mo, pp. 208, ^i.oo. 

This is the latest addition to the popular <♦ Tales 
from Foreign Lands" series, and its literary value is 
of the same high standard as the preceding volumes. 
The story is of a fishing town, on a bay on the shore 
of the cold Northern sea, whose inhabitants are grimly 
silent seafarers and simple villagers. Nanna is the 
daughter of Captain Spang, and Tonnes has risen to 
be first mate on the Captain's ship. During this 
time he has been falling in love with Nanna; and she, 
being young and capricious, has made his wooing 
difficult. Captain Spang is lost at sea, and Nanna 
holds Tonnes responsible and sends him away, but 
finally relents when she has a chance to save his life. 



STORIES OF UNUSUAL INTEREST. 

Lady Lee 

And Other Animal Stories. By Hermon 
Lee Ensign. With 18 full-page photo- 
gravure plates from original drawings by 
Hambidge, Klepper, Beard, and Drake. 
Large 8vo, gilt top, pp. 256, $2.00. 

Lady Lee is a beautiful horse, and the sympathetic 
account of her noble life and tragic death is somewhat 
similar in standpoint to "Black Beauty." The nine 
other stories deal with unusual and interesting phases 
in the lives of domestic animals. 

" Beautifully illustrated and in erery way channing. . . . Seton 
Thompson's interest and sjrmpatby toward wild animals is here 
well matched by Mr. Ensign's sense of kindness and appreciation 
toward domestic animals." — Chicago Tribune, October 9. 

" With that only perfect eye, called sympathy, the author has

WORLD LITERATURE. 



In the happy mediaeval days it was easy to 
be a world-writer. When Latin was the lan- 
guage of scholarship everywhere, and when to 
be educated meant more than anything else the 
ability to read Latin, whatever writings were 
worth heeding promptly made their appeal to 
the whole educated public. It was not a very 
large public in point of numbers, but it was a 
widely-scattered one, and it had a thirst for 
ideas that puts us modems to shame. When 
j the confusion of tongues seized upon the Euro- 
I pean peoples, as a regrettable but inevitable 
incident in the development of their several 
nationalities, the world-writer in the old sense 
became extinct. Yet we cannot altogether re- 
I gret that Dante, for example, wrote his great- 
est work in the vulgar tongue, or that Petrarch 
sought diversion from the serious business of 
the epic in writing certain Italian sonnets to a 
young woman named Laura. Nevertheless, 
" The Divine Comedy " and the " Canzoniere" 
could not hope to find readers outside of Italy, 
whereas the " De Monarchia " and the " Af- 
rica " could command the attention of all the 
world. We can easily understand why Petrarch 
looked slightingly upon his sonnets, and why 
Dante hesitated a long while before turning 
from Latin to Italian. We can also picture 
to ourselves the astonishment of these men, 
could they have foreseen that posterity would 
hold of slight account all that thev wrote in 
the language of scholars, and would treasure 
among the most precious of its literary posses- 
sions their compositions couched in the despised 
language of the common people. 

When the languages of modem Europe 
came to be the recognized vehicles of literary 
expression, there could be no more world- 
writers in the mediaeval sense. The Latin 
classics, of course, retained their prestige, and 
the Greek classics, so eagerly studied by the 
men of the Renaissance, quickly took their 
place beside the Latin, or rather took the 
superior place to which their extraordinary 
spontaneity and perfection entitled them. Bat 
the new writers of the Renaissance centuries 
were nearly restricted to the public of their 
respective peoples. We have seen how Dante 
and Petrarch, standing as it were upon the 



270 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



water-shed that divides ancient from modern 
culture, contributed with doubt and hesitation 
to the streams that were to flow down into 
modern life for its refreshment and quicken- 
ing. Boccaccio was in similar case, although 
perceiving rather more clearly that the vitality 
of Latin literature was well-nigh spent. When 
we come to Ariosto and Tasso, to Rabelais 
and Montaigne, to Cervantes and Lope de 
Vega, to Shakespeare and his starry train, we 
come to an age in which the most remarkable 
manifestations of literary activity are evidently 
indigenous to their own soil. There are no 
longer any world- writers, unless we apply the 
term to such belated classicists as Poliziano 
and Erasmus. If we contrast Erasmus, par- 
ticularly, with any of the great writers just 
named, Shakespeare and the others not only 
write in the languages of their own people, but 
each of them embodies in his thought the dis- 
tinctive characteristics and ideals of his own 
race. Erasmus, on the other hand, is no more 
Dutch than Italian, no more Italian than Ger- 
man, and he is almost as much English as he 
is anything else. While it is true that the 
Elizabethan English displayed a remarkable 
zeal in the work of translation, their activities 
in this direction could not disguise the fact 
that the time for the development of European 
literature upon a common basis of interests 
and aspirations had forever gone by. 

If we take a broad view of the three cen- 
turies from the sixteenth to the eighteenth 
inclusive, we shall see that for the history of 
literature they were centuries of nearly inde- 
pendent development in the five countries that 
really count. National interactions there were, 
no doubt, such as the influence of Italian upon 
English literature, or of French upon German 
literature, but these were on the whole super- 
ficial, and did not in any case seriously modify 
the bent of the national genius. Even the 
unifying influence of the classical heritage 
could not avail to accomplish such a result. 
This statement needs no further proof than is 
offered by a comparison between the treatment 
of classical subjects by Shakespeare and his 
fellows, on the one hand, and by the French 
dramatists, from Corneille to Voltaire, on the 
other. And when we remember that it is not 
much more than a hundred years since Shake- 
speare received adequate recognition in Ger- 
many, or any sort of recognition in France, 
that it is even less than a hundred years since 
Dante came to his own in the hearts of En- 
glishmen and Frenchmen and Germans, we 



shall realize the full meaning of the decentral- 
izing process of modern literary evolution. We 
now speak familiarly of Shakespeare and Dante 
as belonging to the literature of the world, but 
for hundreds of years they belonged only to 
the literatures of their respective peoples. 

Although world literature as a fact has a 
history of many centuries — a history which 
covers the whole classical and mediaeval period, 
down to the development of the modern tongues 
as suitable organs of expression — world lit- 
erature as a name is of rather recent birth. 
In other words, the point of critical self- 
consciousness at which the idea assumed defin- 
ite shape was not reached until very modern 
times. Goethe was the first, we believe, to 
speak of the world literature which to the pro- 
phetic view was even then shaping itself anew, 
and rising upon a broader foundation than its 
classical prototype. Goethe also expressed the 
belief that Germany would contribute some 
share of this new literature to come, a belief 
to which he of all men was best justified in 
giving utterance, for his is the one name since 
Shakespeare's that has by the common agree- 
ment of posterity been added to the list of the 
world's literary immortals. Since Goethe's 
time, the idea has taken shape in many minds, 
and every decade of the past century has seen 
the conditions grow more favorable under 
which a world literature in his sense is possible. 

Let us inquire a little into these conditions. 
Some of them have to us the familiarity of the 
commonplace, although they were startling 
novelties not so very long ago. The linking 
together of the continents by electric wires and 
steel rails, the new means of transportation 
which have made of travel at once a de- 
light and an easily- attainable method of self- 
cultivation, the multiplication and cheapening 
of printed matter whereby the news of the 
whole world is brought to us with little delay 
— these are the conditions that obviously sug- 
gest themselves, and it is plain to see that they 
have accomplished great things for the soli- 
darity of mankind. But this solidarity of 
sympathetic interest has for its necessary con- 
comitant the solidarity of intellectual effort 
that is attested in so many ways, in cooperative 
movements and congresses, in broad educa- 
tional programmes, in the increase of friendly 
intercourse among the peoples, and in the gen- 
eral growth of the cosmopolitan spirit. Under 
these modern conditions, the sort of world lit- 
erature that Goethe had in mind has been 
shaping itself in spite of the barriers of Ian- 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



271 



guage that tend to restrict the free communi- 
cation of ideas. This difficulty is overcome 
partly by translations, and partly by a frank 
recognition of the fact that an educated man 
in our time must be able to read freely at least 
two modern languages besides his own. Neither 
of these agencies alone would suffice, but taken 
together they work wonders. Given a trained 
minority of students, all the time exploring 
and reporting upon contemporary foreign lit- 
erature, and given also a public of readers who 
have acquired the habit of looking abroad for 
ideas and inspirations, and no significant mes- 
sage uttered anywhere in Christendom can long 
escape the attention of cultivated mankind. In 
Goethe's own later years, his dictum was strik- 
ingly illustrated by the European vogue of 
Byron, and all through the century, now by 
Heine, now by Hugo, now by many another 
writer, the free currency of thought that has 
made for a world literature in Goethe's sense 
has appeared among the most insistent phe- 
nomena of the age. 

Finally, glancing at the intellectual life of 
the present time, we find corroborations of our 
thesis upon every hand. To say nothing of 
the work done in science and general scholar- 
ship, which becomes the common property of 
scholars everywhere almost from the moment 
of its first publication, we may find in the field 
of literature proper all the evidence we need. 
One has only to mention the names of Bjorn- 
son, Ibsen, Tolstoy, Sienkiewicz, Hauptmann, 
Sudermann, Maeterlinck, and Zola, to make it 
clear that contemporary literature, in its higher 
ranges and when occupied with large ideas, 
knows no barriers of race or speech, and has 
the whole world for its readers. It is a particu- 
larly impressive fact that of the men just men- 
tioned, the two who would by almost unanimous 
consent be singled out as world-writers 'par 
excellence, write their books in lansruages that 
lie outside the province of the most liberal 
education, and are known only in translations 
to the world at large. There is no writer living 
to-day who is making world literature of the 
permanent sort for which the names of Dante 
and Shakespeare stand, but there are numerous 
writers whose envisagement of the chief aspects 
of modern civilization is so sincere and profound 
that they can command almost equally the at- 
tention of readers in all countries, and fairly 
deserve to be called world-writers. That their 
number will increase rather than diminish 
during the present century is a prediction that 
it seems reasonably safe to make. 



ON THE SHORT STORY. 



The London " Academy " has seen fit recently 
to scoff at the critics who have been exercising 
themselves over the so-called art of the Short 
Story. The Short Story, the " Academy " thinks, 
is a short novel, and its art is distinguished by just 
one thing, and that is inferiority. 

Perhaps there has seemed to be a greater oat- 
pouring of criticism and discussion than this literary 
fashion of the Short Story warrants, since in some 
respects it is a very old fashion indeed, and the 
story of Rath, for instance, or the Paolo and Fran- 
cesca incident in the " Inferno," differ from their 
modern prototypes only in certain characteristics 
of internal structure and external relation. Bat 
the new Short Story has gained more individuality. 
It supports the magazines and has invaded the 
newspapers. It gets itself bound into books and 
has made many authors famous. Is it a separate 
genus of literary expression, belonging to the nar- 
rative family, but distinct from the novel, or is it 
merely a variety of that well-recognized form ? 
Professor Brander Matthews holds to the former 
view, and bases his opinion largely upon a certain 
" unity of impression," which be says is character- 
istic of the Short Story. Mr. Wedmore, the English 
critic, strenuously affirms the distinction between 
the two ; and it may be assumed that Edgar Allan 
Poe held some such belief, for he says that '' Terror, 
passion, horror, most fields but that of pare beauty, 
can be best treated in a tale." 

Considerable evidence will be necessary before 
the Short Story can be proved deserving of a sepa- 
rate classification, and " unity of impression " needs 
some defining before it is ranked under this evi- 
dence. Poe used the phrase in argument, and 
thought mainly of the time element. A tale could 
be read at a sitting ; a novel must be read in gulps, 
as it were, of a handful of chapters each, and the 
impression, which the unity of the tale should con- 
vey, naturally suffered. But Professor Matthews, 
wielding the same phrase, seems to refer to the 
effect of the design of the narrative upon the 
reader, whether read at one sitting or a dozen. 
A single vivid impression is to be the result of the 
Short Story ; while many, diverse yet harmonious, 
impressions are to follow upon the reading of a 
novel. Yet surely many novels, such as George 
Eliot's "Romola" or Meredith's "The Egoist," 
leave a unity of impression not essentially differing 
from that of which Professor Matthews speaks. In 
the first, the degeneration of the beautiful Greek 
is not only the central thread, but the digest of the 
whole story; as in the other book is the egoism of 
Willoughby. Neither this quality nor the unity 
gained by condensation is a completely sufficing 
reason for the separate classification of the Short 
Story. 

There is another way of getting at this matter. 
The great difference between a poem, an historical 



272 



THE DIAIi 



[Oct. 16, 



essay, and a novel upon the same subject, lies in the 
point of view. The poem works through imagi- 
nation and suggestion. The history deals with the 
facts that the poem almost neglects, and has to do 
with selection among these facts. The novel, sup- 
posing it to be historical, uses first the methods of 
the history, leavens the result with fancy, sets it 
forth suggestively, and, keeping in view the end of 
art instead of the necessity for truth, produces 
still other results. Compare, for instance, Carlyle's 
life of Cromwell, Milton's sonnet on Cromwell, and 
Scott's novel based upon the life of the same hero. 
It is such a distinction in the point of view which 
differentiates a novel from a Short Story. 

From the eighteenth century downward, novel- 
ists have tried from their little Olympus to get the 
all-embracing view, to record the good and the bad, 
the thought and the action, the youthful deed and 
the aged penalty. Either by details, or, when that 
was not practicable, by suggestion, their transcrip- 
tion of life has been as full as they could make it. 
Their art is always to imitate the breadth and the 
fulness of living. At one extreme of this imitation 
is realism, and there the picture is somewhat photo- 
graphic ; at the other extreme is romance, where 
the reader's imagination is tickled into supplying 
much not plainly told by the author. In either 
case the life depicted in the books, like the life in 
the world, has many facets ; though the multiplicity 
of actual experience may not be present, the sug- 
gestion of it will not be lacking, if the book is good. 
Thus the novel is natural, in so far as any artistic 
transfer of the real world into the world of imagi- 
nation can be natural. 

In the Short Story, as in the poem or the his- 
tory, there is a different point of view, and there- 
fore a different treatment. Just the reverse of 
this might be true if the story that Mr. Kipling 
writes is merely a variety of the longer form that 
Mr. Hardy uses. But the primal difference lies in 
the way the authors view their crude materials, 
which is to say the life about them. While the 
novel-writer aims at an eminently natural method 
of transcription, the author of the Short Story 
adopts a very artificial one. His endeavor is to 
give a striking narrative picture of one phase of the 
situation or the character, as the case may be. His 
aim is toward a strip lengthwise, disregarding much 
that a cross-section might show. He deals with a 
series of incidents, closely related to one another 
but not at all related to the by-play of life which, 
in reality, must accompany them. He treats of a 
mood always existing, but in the story supremely 
indicated ; perhaps of an adventure or a catastrophe, 
which differs from the dSnouement of a novel in 
that the interest is concentrated, — the cause in the 
hero's character, ready-made for the occasion, the 
results in the circumstances of the tale. If all nar- 
ration amounts, as critics say, merely to a simpli- 
fication of experience, imaginative or real, then a 
Short Story is simplification to the highest degree. 
We are selecting, far more than in a novel, and this 



because we are looking only for the chain of related 
incidents that go to make up one event. We are 
picking out the steps that make the tragedy, as in 
Maupassant's famous tale "La Parure," or in 
Bret Harte's " The Outcasts of Poker Flat "; we 
are looking only for what bears upon our narrow 
purpose, that the interest may be concentrated and 
the conception vivified beyond the power of a novel. 
The process is very artificial but very powerful : it 
is like turning a telescope upon one nebula in the 
heavens. Thus it is the standpoint of the author 
that makes the distinction between a short novel 
and a long Short Story. In the one the writer di- 
gests life histories, or portions of them ; in the other 
he looks only for the episode, which, like the bubble 
on the stream, is part of and yet distinguished from 
the main current. Recognizing the futility in cer- 
tain cases, and the needlessness in others, of ex- 
pressing the whole truth, he succeeds much better 
with the half. He foregoes completeness and gains 
in force, and this by a change in the standpoint 
from which he views his world of fact and fancy. 

There is a great deal of truth in the charge that 
this point of view means superficiality, provided the 
word be taken in its root sense. Of course the 
Short Story is superficial in this way; it is that 
which chiefly distinguishes the form. It is intended 
for surface work ; it is meant to catch and record 
the striking things and make them more striking. 
It is a precipitate of the important things from the 
general solution, and these must be the most easily 
precipitated. There is no room for intricate sub- 
jectivity and plot in a dozen pages. The function 
of the Short Story is to be interesting, to convey 
vivid impressions ; and therefore it must, to a de- 
gree, work with the evident and superficial things. 
Such an endeavor has produced its characteristic 
form, potential for the powerful expression of the 
daily facts about us. Thus, though the novel with 
a purpose is bad enough, the Short Story with a 
purpose beneath its expression of interesting fact 
or fancy, or which forsakes its natural field to delve 
deep into the mystery of things or the confusion of 
psychological character-subtleties, is usually a flat 
failure. Such are some of Hawthorne's tales, — 
good allegories but poor Short Stories. 

New developments in literature do not arise nor 
become popular without reason. There are causes, 
artistic and otherwise, for the present blossoming 
of the Short Story, causes which in themselves differ 
from those which have made the novel flourish. In 
a time of much writing, tastes are quickly jaded, 
and the Short Story, because it is terse, striking, 
highly-colored, and somewhat new, meets with quick 
applause. Its length is of advantage, for many 
people can be made to swallow good literature in a 
pill who reject it in larger doses. But the class of 
readers thus gained accounts less for the literary 
development of the tale than for the vast number 
of poor Short Stories now breeding manifold. Such 
a clientele can increase the production, and will 
usually debase the quality, of any form of literary

production, as the attitude of the prurient-minded 
popalaee of the Restoration increased and debased 
the eatput of the contemporary dramatists. Unin- 
telligent appreciation is not likely to be responsible 
for a high development in art. That there has 
been an artistic advance, and a great one, in Short 
Story telling, needs for illustration only a compari- 
son of a Blackwood's tale of the 30 's and a Kipling 
Indian story. 

The old desire for something new and more 
pungent would account for the encouragement 
which this new development has received. And 
there is an undoubted need, in a generation whose 
life is greatly varied by widely-diffused knowledge 
and extensive intercommunication, for the vivid ex- 
pression of little things. This would add another 
impulse. But a literary structure which displays 
the greatest nicety of form to be found outside the 
domain of poetry indicates some more aesthetic 
cause than those so far mentioned. In simple truth 
the Short Story has attained a wonderful perfection 
because wonderful men have worked with and 
through it It has just come into its own. In 
England of the SO's, publishers would not look upon 
anything less than a volume in fiction as a serious 
literary effort, — and they preferred three volumes. 
It was only in the 40*s that Poe and Hawthorne in 
America began the cult of the tale. Copp^e's 
search for the inevitable word and Maupassant's 
refinement of the conte came later still. The Short 
Story was adapted to the needs of the time and the 
tastes of the people. Men of genius found through 
it a new voice, and the attempt to perfect, to give 
laws and a form to the instrument, progressed be- 
cause of the men who tried. In pre-Hawthornian 
times these authors employed the tale for the by- 
products of their minds ; afterwards it has served 
to express some of the great conceptions of their 
genius. It is this which best accounts for the 
chastening of its form. 

Except in one instance, which is the vivid ex- 
pression of single incidents or detached movements 
in life, the Short Story is not to be chosen before 
the novel ; but in its capabilities for perfection of 
structure, for nice discrimination in means, and for 
a satisfying exposition of the full power of words, 
it is much superior to the novel, and can rank only 
below the poem. But the novel and the Short Story 
are distinct instruments, differently designed, for 
diverse needs. Perhaps if the " Academy " should 
itself take a different point of view, it might not be 
so unwilling to grant to the latter a separate use 



and classification.

Our liAXD OF THE Midnight Sun.* 

A summer in artic seas is the ambition of 
many a traveller, and the land of the midnight 
sun has become the Mecca of an ever-increasing 
number of seekers after the novel and beautif a) 
in nature. It is perhaps to be expected that 
we Americans should seek the picturesque 
fiords of Norway and neglect the arctic shores^ 
of our own Alaska, whose principal products- 
are pay dirt and salmon and whose leading 
ports are Skagway and Nome. The commer- 
cial and industrial exploitation of our north- 
land have, however, already made its shores 
somewhat accessible, and must in time make 
possible a much wider enjoyment of its aesthetic 
treasures. 

" Fiords of the far west shore, where peaks sublime 
Are cloudward thrust 'neath folds of glistening snow, 
With hoar and frigid streams that tideward flow, 

"Mid islets forested, past shores that stand, 
Dark portals opening to enchantment's land." 

But, alas, if we go to Alaska we must see the 
rest of the world first or surfeited stay at home 
thereafter. For as Mr. Henry Gannett says : 
" There is one word of advice and caation to be given 
those intending to visit Alaska for pleasure, for sigbb- 
seeing. If you are old, go by all means; but if you are 
young, wait. The scenery of Alaska is much grander 
than anything else of the kind in the world, and it is 
not well to dull one's capacity for enjoyment by seeing 
the finest first." 

Few travellers may hope to make the journey 
to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and Siberia, 
under circumstances so auspicious, or in com- 
pany so well chosen to utilize the possibilities, 
social, literary, scientific, and artistic, as did 
the members of the Harriman Alaska Expe- 
dition. But he who reads may now in the two 
handsome volumes of the narrative of the ex- 
pedition share in its enjoyment, catch some 
glimpses of the bonhomie which prevailed in 
the party, learn much of the scenery, peoples, 
and resources of Alaskan shores, and — thanks 
to the exquisite illustrations — feast his eyes 
on many bits of Nature's great panorama. His 
sportsman's instincts will be roused by the sight 
of great Kadiak bear, the lone ursine trophy

of the trip. This paucity of the spoils of the 
chase may perhaps be explained by this state- 
ment in the Preface : " Although big game 
played an important part in the original plan, 
no extended or organized effort for hunting 
was made, the sportsmen unselfishly foregoing 
their own pleasure and allowing the scientific 
-workers to use their camp equipment." In 
this combination of big game hunting and 
scientific exploration the Harriman Expedition 
has a parallel, on a much smaller scale, in the 
voyage to Spitzbergen in 1898 of the German 
steamer " Helgoland," which in like manner 
carried a small party of scientists, the results 
of whose work are now appearing in " Fauna 
Arctica." 

The two volumes in hand deal with the nar- 
rative of the expedition, and contain a number 
of additional papers, all of general interest, a 
combination presenting the various phases of 
the subject in topical rather than chronological 
sequence. The technical reports, principally 
in the fields of the natural sciences, will be 
gathered in subsequent volumes. Already 
twenty-two papers of this series have been 
issued through the liberality of Mr. Harriman 
and with the cooperation of the Washington 
Academy of Sciences. Over fifty specialists 
have been at work upon the collections, and 
our meagre knowledge of the natural history 
of the Alaskan region will ultimately be greatly 
extended as a result of the expedition. 

The party consisted of Mr. E. H. Harriman 
and his family, twenty-five scientists, three 
artists, and two photographers, all his guests. 
The guests were invited from leading univer- 
sities in the East and on the Pacific Coast, 
together with representatives from the scien- 
tific departments at Washington, comprising 
altogether, as Mr. Burroughs facetiously re- 
marks, "zoologists, botanists, geologists, and 
other specialists, besides artists, photographers, 
two physicians, one trained nurse, one doctor 
of divinity, and at least one dreamer." 

The steamer " Geo. W. Elder," specially 
chartered for the trip, carried the party from 
Seattle by way of the Inside Passage northward 
for a thousand miles through probably the 
finest scenery of the kind in the world which 
can be viewed from the deck of a ship. The 
glaciers of the Glacier Bay region, including 
the famous one named after Mr. John Muir, 
were visited, and in Prince William Sound a 
new fiord fifteen miles in length, abounding in 
glaciers, was discovered and mapped. Here 
the world-shaping forces are at work : 



" We were really in one of the workshops and lab- 
oratories of the elder gods, but only in the glacier's 
front was there present evidence that they were still at 
work. I wanted to see them opening crevasses in the 
ice, dropping the soil and rocks they had transported, 
polishing the mountains or blocking the streams, but I 
could not. They seemed to knock off work when we 
were watching them." 

Leaving the forests and glaciers of the main 
coast they turned along the treeless Alaskan 
peninsula to the peaceful isle of Kadiak, which 
won a place in the hearts of all the company. 
" If we had other days that were epic, these days 
were lyric. I feel as if I wanted to go back to Kadiak, 
almost as if I could return there to live — so secluded, 
so remote, so peaceful; such a mingling of the domestic, 
the pastoral, the sylvan, with the wild and the rugged; 
such emerald heights, such flowery vales, such blue 
arms and recesses of the sea, and such a vast green 
solitude stretching away to the west, to the north, and 
to the south — bewitching Kadiak! the spell of thy 
summer freshness and placidity is still upon me." 

Past the green hills and meadows of the Shu- 
magin Islands, they steamed northward to the 
home of the fur seal, turning aside only to the 
new volcano Bogoslof, a smoldering witness 
of the recent Titanic struggle of fire, earth, 
and sea. Brief calls were made at the Eskimo 
settlements on the Siberian and American 
shores of Bering Sea, and the prow of the 
" Elder " was turned homeward, passing in re- 
view once more the majestic panorama of the 
Pacific's shores. The ship reached port two 
months after departure, having gone far — 
nine thousand miles — and fared well. 

The narrative of the cruise is from the pen 
of Mr. John Burroughs, the well-known inter- 
preter of nature. His vivid pen pictures vie 
with the exquisite illustrations in their aesthetic 
charm. A chapter upon the glaciers of Alaska 
is written by Mr. John Muir, the veteran of 
the Sierras. He discusses among many other 
things the changes which have taken place 
about Glacier Bay since his visit a score of 
years ago. One of the chief novelties of the 
Alaskan trip is the insight it gives into the 
aboriginal life and culture of the Indian, Aleut, 
and Eskimo. Dr. George Bird Grinnell, the 
editor of " Forest and Stream," writes enter- 
tainingly of these peoples, and the chapter is 
very fully illustrated. Here lies the sad side 
of the Alaskan story. The canneries are rap- 
idly exhausting the salmon streams, the fur 
companies have already reduced and in many 
cases almost exterminated the fur-bearing ani- 
mals, and with them have gone the resources 
for the life of these primitive peoples. Liquor, 
firearms, and the diseases and vices of the

white man are rapidly completing the ruin. 
Indeed, the contamination of the civilized is 
heavy upon them, and the outlook is gloomy. 
The half-hearted attempts made by some of 
the corporations to re-stock the salmon streams, 
and the more successful fox farms, make some 
reparation for the havoc wrought in nature; 
while the peaceful, prim, but dependent colony 
of Metlakahtla — thanks to the altruism of one 
generous soul — has brought the blessings of 
civilization to one isle at least and barred out 
its curse. But even here the shadows are now 
looming. 

The history of the country is written by Dr. 
William Healy Dall, an authority on all things 
Alaskan, and familiar with the country and 
its people through many years of exploration 
along its coast and iuland waters in connection 
with the coast survey. Though brief, this is 
one of the most illuminating chapters in the 
book, especially in its analysis of the forces 
operative in Alaskan history. Matters were 
in a bad way during the last years of Russian 
control, and the transfer to the Republic did 
not work an immediate cure. 

" A history of conditions in Alaska from 1867 to 
1897 is yet to be written, and when written few Ameri- 
cans will be able to read it withont indignation. A 
coantry of which it could be said with little exaggeration 
that 

* Never a law of God nor man 
Runs north of fifty-five '; 

a country where no man could make a leg^l will, own 
a homestead or transfer it, or so much as cut wood for 
his fire without defying a Congressional prohibition; 
where polygamy and slavery and the lynching of witches 
prevailed, with no legal authority to stay or punish 
criminals; such in great part has Alaska been for thirty 
years." 

Mr. Charles Keeler, the well-known au- 
thority on Californian birds, writes of them 
in their northern homes, and of the sea-fowl 
that congregate in Alaskan waters. Colored 
plat«s after drawings by the bird artist, Mr. 
Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and many interesting 
photographs of water-fowl in their rookeries, 
embellish this chapter. The forests, interest- 
ing from a phytographic point of view, but of 
slight economic value, are described by Mr. 
B. E. Fernow; while atmospheric conditions are 
dealt with by Professor Brewer. The geogra- 
phy, climate, and resources are treated fully 
by Mr. Henry Gannett of the U. S. Geolog- 
ical Survey. In his opinion one of the chief 
assets of Alaska, if not the greatest, is the 
scenery. Man can never exhaust it, and he 
can mar it but little. 

"The Alaska coast is to become the show-place of 



the earth, and pilgrims, not only from the United States, 
but from far beyond the seas, will throng in endless 
procession to see it. Its grandeur is more valuable 
than the gold, the fish, or the timber, for it will never 
be exhausted. This value, measured by direct returns 
in money received from tourists, will be enormous; 
measured by health and pleasure it will be incalculable." 

The history of the Bogoslof volcano is given 
in detail by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, an account 
of the salmon canneries by Mr. Grinnell, and 
of the fox farms by Mr. M. L. Washbam. 
The cheery " Song of the Innuit People," by 
Dr. Dall, completes the second volume. 

The division of subjects among many writers 
in a work of this kind of necessity detracts 
somewhat from the unity of the whole, and 
eliminates largely any dominating personal 
element, — both qualities of literary strength, as 
evidenced in the narrative of Nansen. On 
the other hand, as we see in this work, a com- 
bination in authorship can afford a scope and 
a variety both in matter and form which is 
rarely if ever secured from a single pen. 

The editing and the illustration of these 
volumes has been superintended by Dr. C. Hart 
Merriam, and the result merits the highest 
praise. The illustrations are bountifully sup- 
plied and exquisitely executed. They include 
one hundred and twenty-five full-page plates, 
of which thirty-nine are in colors. The photo- 
gravure plates, made by various firms, are prin- 
cipally of Alaskan scenery, having been selected 
from the five thousand negatives, official and 
private, taken on the expedition. The colored 
plates of scenery are from paintings by Mr. 
R. Swain Gifford and Mr. Fred S. Dellenbaugh. 
About two hundred and fifty line drawings by 
Messrs. W. E. Spader, Charles B. Hudson, 
and Louise M. Keeler further illustrate the 
text, and five specially-prepared maps serve to 
mark the route and to set forth some of the 
geographical discoveries. In this wealth of 
illustration these volumes surpass all previously 
published works of American travel. The 
typography, binding, and paper exhibit excel- 
lent taste, and the volumes are fine examples 
of the book-maker's art. 

The skill which the host of the Harriman 
Expedition has manifested in the world of 
finance in marshalling and directing men and 
means for definite ends has been shown in his 
conduct of this Alaskan expedition, the out- 
come of which is given to the public in these 
two sumptuous volumes. It is certainly not 
too much to claim for them a place in the front 
rank of books of American travel. Chaste and 
elegant in design and execution, artistic from

A Dictionary of Philosophy and 
Psychology.* 



Dictionaries are rarely inspiring subjects 
for review, any more than they are profitable 
material for continuous reading. Yet they 
possess an interest peculiarly their own, and 
their profitable use forms one of the important 
aids to scholarship. The bringing together in 
convenient form of the equipment — the rolling 
stock as it were — of a given trunk-line of in- 
tellectual commerce is naturally a task of con- 
siderable magnitude and difficulty, to be entered 
upon with deliberate appreciation of its inherent 
limitations, to be pursued with perseverance and 
tact, with fortitude and patience unassailable by 
trials of the spirit or drudgery of the flesh, to 
be completed with undisguised expressions of 
gratitude and appeals to charity. And surely 
must this be the case in a work dealing with 
the intricate and vast and imperfectly-coordi- 
nated discipline described as Philosophy and 
Psychology. 

In speaking of Professor Baldwin's under- 
taking the reviewer's first duty is to record his 
appreciation of the task thus accomplished ; 
and with it, in the present instance, may be 
coupled an equally appreciative word of con- 
gratulation to the editor and his able and rep- 
resentative staff of contributors and sub-editors. 
This dictionary is not only the first adequate 
work of its kind in English, but may be said 
to be the first adequate philosophic dictionary 
in any language. It is accordingly with much 
proper pride that attention is called to the very 
large proportion of contributions emanating 
from American scholars. The work is, however, 
international in character; and the inclusion of 
foreign equivalents, and still better the inclus- 
ion of foreign sanction and revision by special- 
ists of all nationalities, is one of the important 
and commendable features of the undertaking. 
And yet in plan, and considerably in execution, 
it remains an American product. It is directed 
primarily toward meeting the needs of English

readers, though it prevents the English usage 
from assuming any undue importance by giving 
to philosophical terms their proper historical 
setting. It is the purpose of the Dictionary 
" to understand the meanings which our terms 
have, and to render them by clear definitions ; 
and to interpret the movements of thought 
through which the meanings thus determined 
have arisen, with a view of discovering what 
is really vital in the development of thought 
and term in one." While terms that require 
only a definition to indicate their local habitat 
and their relations to larger conceptions are 
thus merely defined, the terms with larger 
intention or with eventful life-histories are 
sketched in outline yet with some suggestion 
of detail. For such a discipline as Philosophy 
and Psychology a mere skeletonizing of terms 
would be of but very limited and doubtful 
value. The vital qualities of flesh and blood 
must be indicated, even if only by a line or 
two ; it must be clear with regard to all but 
merely historical usages that not museum- 
specimens but natural life-forms with an actual 
environment are being described. This means 
that the work in regard to the more important 
and more modern terms must be encyclopaedic 
in character ; this it is, and is the more success- 
ful in those parts in which this policy has been 
carried through. The landof Philosophy and 
Psychology does not need mere indexing : it 
requires a descriptive guide-book that has a 
definite and consistent perspective, that ob- 
serves the " stars " and " double stars " of im- 
portance and handles the reader authoritatively 
yet intelligently. In these aspects the work 
is in the main successful, though by no means 
equally so in the several departments; 

With regard to the fact-material of the work, 
the separate and coordinate specification of 
Psychology is the most significant point. This 
reflects the importance of the psychological 
factor in all modern treatment of philosophical 
problems, and it reflects the many and diverse 
enlargements of the psychological outlook 
which recent investigation has brought about. 
Psychology as a specialty is a far more com- 
prehensive and consistent discipline than it 
was a half-century ago ; and the psychological 
aspects of other sciences — notably biology, 
sociology, medicine, ethics, anthropology — 
have been more distinctively and appreciatively 
recognized. In the distribution of space, Phil- 
osophy and Psychology flnd a coordinate first 
place ; Ethics together with Anthropology, and 
Mental Pathology together with Neurology, are

second in space representation ; the third places 
are filled by Esthetics and by Logic ; the fourth 
by Philosophy of Religion and by Biology ; 
the fifth by Sociology together with Political 
Philosophy, and by Economics together with 
Physiology ; the sixth by Philology and by Law ; 
the seventh by Education, and by Physics in- 
cluding Mathematics. This distribution is 
interesting in itself, and may serve to indicate 
the scope of the several departments of learn- 
ing for which the dictionary is to serve more 
or less fully as a guide. 

A mildly critical scrutiny is sufficient to dis- 
cover inequalities and deficiencies of execution ; 
this is the natural result of the many minds of 
many men, and editors, however encyclopaedic 
and diplomatic, can hardly equalize or adjudi- 
cate individual differences. The inclusion of 
disciplines — such as law or biology — that 
offer a direct contribution to the general con- 
tent and conceptions of philosophy, is eminently 
proper ; but the inclusion in a philosophical 
dictionary of terms under these heads without 
such philosophical bearing seems very ques- 
tionable. A work that passes from " Admiralty 
Jurisdiction " to " Antenna " seems almost too 
comprehensive : and surely neither psycholo- 
gist nor biologist nor student of law seems 
likely to look for such terms in a dictionary of 
philosophy. That there are occasional lapses 
from the spirit of the editor's Introduction 
will not surprise the editor. The skeleton form 
of exposition is now and then to be met with, 
and sometimes in important articles. The 
article on " Binocular Vision " tells almost 
nothing, and may be contrasted with the article 
on the " Blind-spot " — a far less extensive 
term but one occupying more space and satis- 
factorily outlined. Two other faults of defini- 
tion are also to be met with : the one the 
securing of a brief definition at the cost of 
extreme technicality ; the other the lack of 
brevity by reason of trying to describe too 
much in the definition. The first is unfair to 
the student who goes to the work for enlight- 
enment ; the other is unfair to the scholar who 
goes to the dictionary for a terse formulation 
of conceptions already familiar. Of the latter 
the only available definition given under " An- 
alogy " is an example : it is introduced by the 
word " briefly," and then goes on to the extent 
of seventy-two words, arranged intelligently 
enough, but by no means cogently. But when 
all is said and done, these faults are distinctly 
of a minor order, and are not frequent enough 
to mar the general excellence of the whole. 



The plan and scope of the dictionary are 
conceived in an admirable spirit ; and the work 
will doubtless promptly find its way to the 
shelves of our libraries and studies as the 
standard work of its kind. It remains to add 
that the work will appear in three volumes, of 
which the first — including from A to Law — 
covers 644 pages ; that the third volume will 
supplement the introductory bibliographies 
given under the several terms by more com- 
prehensive and classified bibliographical lists; 
and that in mechanism and convenience the 
volume leaves nothing to be desired.

IfrSETEENTH CKXTURT lilTERATTJKE.* 



It is now just thirty years since Dr. Georg 
Brandes began, in Copenhagen, to deliver a 
series of lectures upon European literature. 
These lectures were continued for about ten 
years, and constituted a survey of the whole 
modern intellectual movement, as it found ex- 
pression in the literature of France, Germany, 
and England, from the time of the French 
Revolution down to about the middle of the 
century just ended. As one phase after another 
of this survey was completed by the lecturer, 
the results were published in a series of vol- 
umes bearing the general title of " Main Cur- 
rents in Nineteenth Century Literature" 
(Hovedstromninger i det Nittende Aarhund- 
redes Literatur). Six volumes were produced 
altogether, the whole constituting a truly monu- 
mental work of combined literary history and 
criticism — certainly one of the half-dozen 
most important critical works of the century. 
Few readers outside of the Scandinavian conn- 
tries could benefit by a work written in the 
Danish language, but German translations 
were promptly made, and in this form the vol- 
umes of " Hauptstrbmungen " have for the 
past quarter- century been an indispensable part 
of the apparatus of every worker in the field 
of modern European literature. For many 
years it has been to us a source of wonderment 
that so important a work should have remained 
untranslated into our own language ; now, a 
full score of years from the date of its com- 
pletion, the work is to appear in English, and 
the first volume has recently been issued. 

In an introductory chapter, the author sets

forth his conception of nineteenth century lit- 
erature as " a historical movement partaking 
of the form and character of a drama." He 
goes on to say : 

" The six different literary groups it is my intention 
to represent may be looked on as six acts of a great 
play. In the first group, the French Emigrant Liter- 
ature inspired by Rousseau, the reaction begins, but 
here the reactionary are still everywhere mingled with 
the revolutionary currents. In the second group, the 
semi-Catholic Romantic school of Germany, the reaction 
is on the increase; it is more vigorous and holds itself 
more aloof from the contemporary struggle for progress 
and liberty. The third group, consisting of such men 
as Joseph de Maistre, Lamennais in his strictly ortho- 
dox period, Lamartine and Victor Hugo when they 
(after the restoration of the monarchy) were still 
mainstays of the Legitimist and Clerical party, repre- 
sents the militant, triumphant reaction. Byron and his 
English contemporaries form the fourth group. It is 
this one man, Byron, who produces the revulsion in the 
great drama. The Greek war of liberation breaks out, 
a revivifying breeze blows over Europe, Byron falls 
like a hero in the cause of Greece, and his death makes 
a tremendous impression on all the productive minds 
of the Continent. Shortly before the Revolution of 
July a change of front occurs among the great authors 
of France; they form the French Romantic school, 
which is our fifth group, a new Liberal movement on 
the rolls of whose adherents we find such names as 
Lamennais, Hugo, Lamartine, Musset, George Sand, 
etc. The movement passes from France into Germany, 
and in that country also Liberal ideas are victorious. 
The writers forming the sixth and last group which I 
shall depict. Young Germany, are inspired by the ideas 
of the Greek war of liberation and the Revolution of 
July, and, like the French authors, see in Byron's great 
shade the leader of the Liberal movement. The authors 
of Young Germany, Heine, Borne, Gutzkow, Ruge, 
Feuerbach, etc., prepare, together with the contempor- 
ary French authors, the great upheaval of 1848." 

Such was the ambitious programme of the 
young Danish doctor of philosophy when he 
began to lecture in his capital city thirty years 
ago. Here was a conception of literature cal- 
culated fairly to take the breath away from 
the mere aesthetician. Here was a critic who 
believed literature to be intimately and vitally 
connected with human life and with the his- 
torical development of the social organism. 

That there should be no mistake concerning 
the author's enlarged conception of literary 
history, he more than once, in the course of his 
lectures, emphasized his purpose of bringing 
literature into its proper relations with life. 
A fine passage in the second series gives us a 
typical expression of the attitude which he 
throughout maintains. 

" It follows from my conception of the relation of 
literature to life that the history of literature I teach 
is not a history of literature for the drawing-room. I 
seize hold of actual life with all the strength I may, 
and show how the feelings that find their expression in 



literature spring up in the human heart. Now the 
human heart is no stagnant pool or idyllic woodland 
lake. It is an ocean with submarine vegetation and 
frightful inhabitants. The literary history and the 
poetry of the drawing-room see in the life of man a 
salon, a decorated ball-room, the men and the furnish- 
ings polished alike, in which no dark corners escape 
illumination. Let him who will look at matters from 
this point of view, but it is no affair of mine." 

The preparation of a work undertaken in this 
spirit evidently called for an unusual equip- 
ment on the part of its author. He must have 
philosophical breadth of view, an unerring in- 
stinct for the typical as distinguished from the 
accidental, and a frank acceptance of the con- 
clusions of modern thought. It is not too much 
to say that the completed work justifies its 
ambitious programme, and that Dr. Brandes 
has proved himself one of the soundest of criti- 
cal historians. The very matters which aroused 
violent controversies at the time when his lec- 
tures were delivered are those which to-day, 
after the lapse of a quarter-century, appear of 
the most vital importance. Most literary criti- 
cism is apt to seem a little old-fashioned a gen- 
eration after it is produced, and it is a striking 
tribute to the author's large conception of lit- 
erature and life that, except for a few details, 
his work remains essentially true in perspective 
and convincing in exposition. 

In some respects it seems truer and more 
convincing than it could have seemed in the 
seventies, when critical tradition weighed 
heavily upon men's judgments, and the author's 
voice was as of one crying in the wilderness. 
Let us take one of his boldest pronouncements 
as an illustration. It took more courage than 
it would take to-day for a young man thirty 
years ago to write the following lines : 

*' I believe that the time will come when Goethe's 
Iphigenia will not be considered appreciably more 
Greek than Racine's, when it will be discovered that 
the German Iphigenia's dignified morality is as German 
as the French Iphigenia's graceful refinement is French. 
. . . The spirit of the French people resembles the 
Greek spirit in its absolute freedom from awkwardness, 
its love of lightness, elegance, form and colour, passion 
and dramatic life. No reasonable person would dream 
of ranking the French with the Greeks. The distance 
between them is so great as to be practically unmeasur- 
able. Still one must maintain their right to the place 
of honour against those who assert that the Germans 
stand nearer to the Greeks. ... If France is far from 
being a Greece in art, Germany is still farther. Of all 
the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, the Germans 
have only succeeded in acclimatising one — Pallas 
Athene, and in Germany she wears spectacles. Mme. 
de Stael might have observed to Schlegel that an 
Athene with spectacles is not much more beautiful than 
a Jupiter with a wig." 

The best criticism, we believe, has in our

time come around to substantially this view, 
but how strangely the words must have sounded 
to their first Teutonic hearers. 

The volume now published, as has already 
been stated, deals with what Dr. Brandes calls 
the " emigrant literature." He means by this 
the literature of opposition to the Napoleonic 
order, whether legitimist or liberal, and he 
calls it " emigrant literature " because in those 
days " it was only far from Paris, in lonely 
country places, where he lived a life of death- 
like stillness, or beyond the frontier, in Swit- 
zerland, Germany, England, or North America, 
that the French man of letters pursued his 
calling." After noting the profound influence 
of " La Nouvelle Heloise " and " Werther " 
upon the literature of the period, the author 
takes up the special group of writers which 
includes Chateaubriand, Senancour, Nodier, 
Constant, and Mme. de Stael. An account of 
Barante's retrospective view of eighteenth cen- 
tury literature completes the survey. The 
group at first sight seems to have little unity, 
but Dr. Brandes provides the philosophical 
nexus, and we close the volume with the feeling 
that he has justified his design. He shows 
also how these writers were the logical pre- 
cursors of those who came after them. 

" Looked at from one point of view, this group pre- 
pares the way for the later religious and political 
reaction in French literature; looked at from another, 
it prepares the way for the Romantic School in France. 
It is the best of introductions to the study and under- 
standing of the Romantic School in Germany, it has 
even points of contact with such remote phenomena as 
Byron and Balzac. In a word, the Emigrant Literature 
constitutes the prologue to the great literary drama of 
the century."

Under Both Fl-ags in South Africa.* 



The feeling of weariness with which the 
usual narrative of a South African war corre- 
spondent is taken up dissipates itself quickly 
in the case of Mr. Unger's entertaining and 
instructive book. The author's candor has 
much to do with this engagement of the atten- 
tion at the threshold of his story. The spirit 
of adventure had taken him to the Klondyke 
and he had undergone much suffering there. 
The news of the outbreak of hostilities between 
the two Republics and Great Britain reached

ican War Correspondent in the Field with Both Armies. By 
Frederic William Unger. Illustrated from Photographs 
taken by the Author. Philadelphia : Henry T. Coates & Co. 



him at a moment of depressed fortune in the 
North, and he made up his mind forthwith to 
seek employment in this new field. Nothing 
but discouragement followed his efforts to ob- 
tain work from the New York and Philadelphia 
papers, so he set out for Cape Town with a 
little borrowed money, hoping to find some 
local journal which needed his services. 

After a series of experiences which would 
have discouraged an older man, or anyone less 
self-reliant, Mr. linger found himself at the 
front as the authorized correspondent of the 
Grahamstown " Daily Mail," with a certain 
minor connection with the London " Times," 
gained through the good offices of Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling ; but these commissions were not ob- 
tained until after desperation had forced him 
to offer his services to the British Crown as a 
member of a command which required the 
ability to ride well and shoot straight. Mr. 
Unger could do neither, and is doubtless glad 
that he was so promptly found out and rejected. 
He was at the battle of Paardeburg, the occu- 
pation of Bloemfontein, attached himself to 
General French's column in pursuit of General 
DeWet after witnessing the capture of Cronje 
and the battle of Poplar Grove ; and, while 
taking part in the general advance upon Pre- 
toria, received a commission from the London 
" Express " and New York " Journal " to pro- 
ceed to the capital of the Transvaal. 

By a bit of bravado Mr. Unger succeeded 
in passing through the Portuguese territory, 
and was soon busily engaged in ingratiating 
himself with the Boer authorities, just as he 
had done a few months before with the British. 
He was for many days after the occupancy of 
Pretoria and the transfer of the seat of gov- 
ernment to Machadodorp the only source of 
news received in England and America from 
the burgher government, and it was he who 
announced to the world President Krueger's 
determination to go on fighting without refer- 
ence to the loss of Pretoria and Bloemfontein 
— a determination which seems to have found 
some of its inspiration in our own War of In- 
dependence, so far does a good deed shine in 
a naughty world. Mr. Unger relates a con- 
versation which he had with Secretary Reitz, 
whom he found studying a child's history of 
the United States. 

"•I've been reading here,' went on Mr. Reitz, be- 
tween successive puffs of smoke, ' all about your Revo- 
lutionary War, and I find it is extremely interesting; 
and what 's more, so very encouraging to us at this 
time. Look here,' and he began to turn the pages; 'I 
read here that in the winter of 1777, when your General 



280 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Washington was at Valley Forge, near Philadelphia, 
his army was reduced to only fifteen hundred in num- 
ber, and he knew the name of every man under him, 
and that at the same time the English held your prin- 
cipal cities of New York and Philadelphia. The com- 
parison between that time and our present situation is 
so very striking and so much in our favor that I feel 
greatly encouraged. You see, this is our winter, and 
our burghers are suffering severely; the British have 
possession of all our principal cities — Bloemfontein, 
Johannesburg, and Pretoria, — yet we have a fairly com- 
fortable capital here at Machadodorp; our armies have 
plenty of supplies, and, though scattered, they number 
at least fifteen thousand men, and their hearts are full 
of hope and determination. Do n't you see how much 
better off, in comparison, than you were, we are in this 
our darkest hour. And yet you won your liberty and 
independence; and I think we will also, for I know we 
are in the right, and I believe God will help us! ' And 
the old man looked intently at me, his eyes glistening, 
his entire being radiating belief and complete confidence 
in what he was saying. 

" What an appeal to my school-boy enthusiasm and 
patriotism! I felt tears coming to my eyes; I sought 
in vain for something to say to encourage and comfort 
the old statesman and patriot sitting beside me, his 
eyes sparkling with hope and enthusiasm as he talked 
and turned over the pages of that familiar school-book. 
Then, as I thought how my country, where almost every 
man and woman and school-child within its boundaries 
were watching this unequal struggle, half a world away, 
with sympathy for one contestant and anger for the 
other, our own hereditary enemy — as I thought how 
my country had stood aloof, her administration crying 
Neutrality! neutrality! while with her left hand she 
allowed and encouraged the selling of millions worth 
of horses and forage to England to use in the war, and 
with her right hand refused to insist on the enforcement 
of neutrality on the part of Portugal where American 
supplies for the burghers were being wrongly detained 
in the customs-house, that the armies of the Republics 
might be starved into submission — as these things 
passed through my mind I grew sad and sick at heart." 

Mr. Reitz assured Mr. Unger that the burghers 
could hold out six months longer, and the 
sequel proves that they have been able to ex- 
tend that time already more than eleven months, 
with prospects of an almost indefinite extension, 
completely justifying President Krueger's 
statement to Mr. Unger on June 5, 1900, " We 
will never surrender as long as five hundred 
armed men remain together." 

Nor will the difficulties be ended when the 
last of the burghers lay down their arms, if 
ever they do. One of the government officials 
told Mr. Unger at Machadodorp this story : 

" The [Transvaal] government originally leased the 
mines [about Johannesburg] with the provision that if 
at any time they should remain unworked for a period 
of six months the leases would revert to the government. 
Of course, the beginning of the war put a stop to all 
mining operations, and when the war was six months 
old the government privately sold the reverted leases 
to French and German capitalists. Now when the war 
is officially declared over, these capitalists, through 



their governments, will insist on their claims, and all 
sorts of unpleasant complications for England will be 
the result. Nothing will be done in this matter until 
the war is entirely at an end, for the Powers desire 
that England shall have expended as much of her re- 
sources as possible in her contest with the Republics. 
. . . England will certainly object to surrendering the 
mines, and then the trouble will begin," 

As Mr. Unger adds, it will be interesting to 
remember this phase of the complication. 

The post at Machadodorp was abandoned a 
short time before President Krueger took ship 
for Holland, Mr. Unger finding it a difficult 
one. His sympathies seem to have been divided 
between the two contestants in such a manner 
that he was able to avoid much of the prejudice 
in favor of either. This is not shown in his 
final chapter, however, where he gives credence 
to the British tale of a general conspiracy on 
the part of the Afrikander Bund to drive the 
English out of South Africa, in the face of 
the authorities to the contrary ; and his state- 
ment that the aims of the United States and 
Great Britain in the world are identical, in the 
face of Washington's warning and all our 
earlier history. Still, this attitude makes the 
book one from which both sides can obtain en- 
lightenment ; and his parting advice to the 
victors, to use their victory honestly and avoid 
pressing toward the total extinction of the Re- 
publics, is undeniably sound. 

In addition to its presentation of the serious 
side of the war and its diplomacy, there are 
scores of entertaining anecdotes in the book 
concerning the men with whom Mr. Unger was 
brought in contact during his sojourn in Africa, 
including several of Mr. Kipling, who seems 
to have been something more than a leader and 
benefactor to the British soldier.

The Opinions of a Statesman.* 



When one considers the methods by which 
political parties choose the men who fill our 
offices and manage our public affairs, and the 
kind of men who pull the wires that bring 
about nominations, it is a cause of profound 
satisfaction as well as of wonder that our highest 
office has been filled by a succession of men of 
ability and honor, of whom we have good reason 
to be proud. It is really a most striking tribute 
to the insight and discrimination of the mass

of our voters, with perhaps a wholesome ad- 
mixture of fear of the independent minority 
whom the party managers cannot count on to 
vote as they dictate, that the men nominated 
for the office of president are worthy in char- 
acter and ability to stand at the head of a 
great nation. And it is interesting to see how 
men who have been rated as second class by 
their opponents, if not by their friends, have 
risen to meet their responsibilities, and have 
given the nation no cause for shame ; and to 
see what unsuspected gifts lay concealed in 
some politicians who had been long in promi- 
nent positions before the people. 

While these remarks are not intended to 
apply especially to Mr. Harrison, they are 
illustrated in a way by the volume under con- 
sideration. It is made up of his papers and 
addresses on subjects of public interest written 
after the close of his administration in 1893. 
The collection shows an earnest devotion to the 
public good, a sound wisdom on public ques- 
tions, and a felicity of presentation, that make 
the volume an admirable memorial of a distin- 
guished public servant. 

First in the book come six lectures on 
the origins of the Constitution, delivered 
at Stanford University in 1894. They go 
over ground that is familiar to every student 
of our history, but they have a distinct value 
in their clear statement of the principles of 
development of our institutions, a power which 
the distinguished author developed through a 
long course of speaking to popular audiences 
in political campaigns. His treatment of the 
well-worn subject is also enriched by his famil- 
iarity with the practical affairs of government 
gained through senatorial discussions and law- 
making, and through the intense labors of ad- 
ministration incident to his position at the 
head of the nation. The lectures bear on their 
face the evidence that they are not the work 
of a professional scholar, but rather of a prac- 
tical man of scholarly tastes ; the general 
reader will find no disadvantage in this. 

The first lecture discusses the vital principles 
of the Constitution, partly as inherited through 
ages of national growth in England, and partly 
as the result of a combination of these inherited 
principles with the religious, social, and physical 
conditions of the new world. The author rightly 
makes much of the influence of Puritanism in 
the development of our national character 
through New England ; of the fidelity to con- 
viction that it bred ; of the ideas of freedom 
and equality as a result of the levelling doe- 



trine of the equality of man in the sight of 
God ; of the individual's right to decide what 
things were Caesar's and what things were 
God's ; and of the doctrine that king and sub- 
ject were brothers equally insignificant in the 
sight of God. He shows also the influence of 
unstinted land upon the character of the people, 
of the nearness of hostile savages, and of the 
simplicity and absence of distinctions of the 
life of the colonists. The lecture closes with 
a discussion of local government both as a tra- 
ditional principle among Englishmen, and as a 
necessity under the conditions prevailing in 
the New World. 

The nature of the other five lectures is in- 
dicated sufficiently by their titles : The Co- 
lonial Charters, Legal Aspects of the Contro- 
versy between the American Colonies and 
Great Britain, Early Attempts at Union and 
the Union De Facto, The Confederation, and 
The Institution of State Governments. 

Next follow three papers into which the vet- 
eran statesman evidently put his whole heart, 
which, though they have been violently criti- 
cized for their political bearings, yet show a 
statesman's grasp of fundamental principles as 
applied to great political questions at home 
and abroad. These papers were published in 
the "North American Review" early in the 
present year, and are yet so fresh in the public 
mind that there is now no need of a synopsis 
of them. The author may have belonged to a 
generation that is too old to reverse its long- 
cherished ideas as to the nature of our govern- 
ment and its relation to the territory that lies 
beyond immediate reach, a generation that is 
beyond the point where it can change its con- 
ception of the Constitution even at the bidding 
of the Supreme Court, — especially when the 
reasoning of that court does not command con- 
fidence. But we cannot but honor him for his 
courage in opposing the policy of the party 
that had highly honored him, and in striking 
sturdy blows for those principles that he be- 
lieved vital to the welfare of the nation that he 
loved ; and we must recognize the strength of 
argument and ardent patriotism that we see in 
the Michigan University address on " The 
Status of Annexed Territory " and in the 
"Musings on Current Topics." 

The second part of the book contains, besides 
a legal argument on " The Inheritance Tax 
Cases " and several brief occasional addresses, 
the strong address on " Some Hindrances to 
Law Reforms " given to the students of the 
University of Michigan, and the similar one

on "The Obligations of Wealth" spoken be- 
fore the Union League Club of Chicago on 
Washington's Birthday. Both are striking 
appeals to the conscience of the people to ex- 
tirpate from the body politic an evil that threat- 
ens to corrupt our public life at its source, 
and one that offers most encouragement to pub- 
lic lawlessness. This evil is the corrupt use of 
wealth to prevent reforms aimed at the unright- 
eous advantages that such wealth holds and 
uses to take more than its share of the products 
of industry or the gifts of nature; and the twin 
evil of robbing the people by avoiding just 
taxes, and thus compelling others to bear more 
than their share of public burdens for the ben- 
efit of those most able to pay. If the earnest 
and weighty words of this tried public servant 
could only reach and touch this class of public 
robbers, respectable men though many of them 
are, he would be a public benefactor indeed. 

The inspiring addresses delivered by Mr. 
Harrison as president of the Ecumenical 
Missionary Conference last year are worthy of 
special note. Nowhere has he shown greater 
felicity of expression or greater nobility of 
ideas and spirit than in these brief utterances. 

It is necessary to speak, unpleasant though it 
may be, of the great change of tone that becomes 
evident in turning from the sincere and earnest 
speeches that show a wise statesman and good 
man at his best, to the few partisan addresses 
and articles contained in the book. Instead of 
deep indignation at corruption and at what he 
deemed destructive public policy, we have the 
politician's professional and perfunctory indig- 
nation at the policy and alleged corruption of 
the other party. Instead of the statesman's and 
the lawyer's sound reasoning, we have the poli- 
tician's fallacies of half-truths and the poli- 
tician's misrepresentation of the men and 
measures on the other side. As stump speeches 
these papers serve the purpose, but they make 
a sorry showing beside the dignified and sound 
contents of the volume.

which we have in him is many-sided. As the lover 
of Heloise his name is immortal in romance; as 
the keenest dialectician of his age he is of import-

vanced thinker on matters of religion he reached 



conclusions which, rejected by the church of his 
day, have become the fundamentals of modern 
theology. That up to the present time we have 
had, in English, no satisfactory life of so remark- 
able a man is more than strange, but now Mr. 
Joseph McCabe's volume (Putnam) atones ex- 
ceptionally well for the deficiency. The story of 
the brilliant controversialist's career is one of ab- 
sorbing interest, dramatic, full of striking incidents, 
glowing with the warmth of an ardent and high- 
hearted personality, and Mr. McCabe has made the 
most of its possibilities. Thoroughly familiar with 
the philosophical and ecclesiastical discussions of 
the time, and with the characters of those who 
were shaping men's lives then, as he shows himself 
to be, he makes the men and the movements, the 
passions and purposes that stirred them, clear and 
convincingly real at once. From the beginning the 
interest centres in the man rather than in his ideas ; 
and for this reason, perhaps, the reader not famil- 
iar with the wranglings of the schoolmen may 
sometimes, like little Peterkin, wish to know what 
it was all about. This, however, will be true of 
details only ; the general course of Abelard's rea- 
soning, the basic principles of his thought, are made 
sufficiently clear, and more than this might easily 
have interrupted the rapid movement of the story. 
As it is, the misfortunes of a life devoted to truth 
in an age of ecclesiastical tyranny are full of a 
pathos which is heightened by the strangely sweet 
and enduring love of Heloise, whom Mr. McCabe 
portrays with singularly clear and true penetration. 
So manifestly unjust and cruel were the persecu- 
tions that chastened Abelard's eager spirit towards 
the last sad days among the monks at St. Marcellus 
that the indignant reader will be tempted to repeat 
his heart-wrung question, " Good Jesus, where wert 
Thou?" For readers of all classes, the writer's 
sympathy with his subject will be found infectious, 
and both for its scholarly and for its human inter- 
est the book should be widely read by those who 
care to trace the development of the human spirit.

to the impecunious, and Rossettians of slender purse 
could but await in patience the appearance of a 
cheaper edition, which usually follows in due course 
the first publication of such a book. After nearly 
two years the work is now issued (Macmillan) in a 
form which, though by no means inexpensive, may 
be had for considerably less than half the price of 
the original edition. Of books dealing with Ros- 
setti the man there are enough, — more than enough, 
perhaps, — and Mr. Marillier has not sought to add 
another to the list. His volume is essentially an 
account of Rossetti's art, and is concerned with 
biographical details only so far as necessary to con- 
nect and illustrate the artistic record. In critical 
soundness, thoroughness, and manner of presenta-

tion, the work leaves little to be desired. It was 
readily accepted on its first appearance as the aa- 
thoritative account of Rossetti's art, and we are not 
likely ever to have a better. In addition to the 
correction of some minor errors of statement, the 
present edition has been considerably abridged in 
both text and illustrations. The excisions are such, 
however, as only the closest student of Rossetti's 
work need miss. They consist mainly, in the text, 
of some of the detailed descriptions of particular 
works ; and the chronological list of pictures, one of 
the most valuable features of the book, now appears 
without the historical notes. As regards the illus- 
trations, the absence of some important pictures, 
notably several from Mr. Rae's fine collection, is 
explained by the fact that arrangements with the 
owners of originals made it impossible to include 
reproductions in any other than the first edition. 
But even with these omissions, the pictorial equip- 
ment is lavish indeed. There are twelve finely- 
executed photogravures, no less than eighty full- 
page plates in half-tone, and a number of line 
illustrations in the text. The frontispiece is a 
beautiful photogravure from Rossetti's masterpiece, 
"The Beloved," — a painting which, to quote Mr. 
F. G. Stephens, " is in English art what Spenser's 
gorgeous and passionate ' Epithalamium ' is in 
English verse." A very full index makes Mr. 
Marillier's splendid volume readily accessible for 
purposes of reference. 

Recognition of the rights of dumb 
animals is one of the gifts for which 
mankind may thank the vanishing 
nineteenth century, and one of the advances of 
civilization of which we have great cause to be 
proud. Not the least of the bequests of that time 
to this is to be found in the beautiful book by the 
late Hermon Lee Ensign, just published under the 
title of " Lady Lee, and Other Animal Stories " 
(McClurg). The author was born in Carbondale, 
Pennsylvania, June 30, 1849. but his boyhood and 
early youth were passed in Bureau county, Illinois. 
At the age of twenty-one he removed to Chicago, 
in which city several years later he aided in the 
establishment of " The Alliance," a weekly journal 
of great promise and short life. With the experi- 
ence gained here, the young man took up the busi- 
ness of advertising, and soon amassed a competency, 
a successful invention or two adding to his wealth. 
From infancy a lover of animals, he gave freely 
during his lifetime to the various societies for the 
prevention of cruelty to beasts and the humbler 
creatures, and The National Humane Alliance, to 
which he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune, was 
of his own institution. Always a lover of his pen, 
he left behind a mass of literary material at his 
untimely death in February, 1899, from which has 
been selected the stories contained in this pleasant 
volume. As might be expected, the ten little tales 
which make up the book are informed with a genial 
and tender love for animated things, and bespeak

a consideration and forbearance which make them 
the best of reading. In almost every case the old, 
old lesson is repeated which proves that kindness is 
the best policy, and that all greed and selfishness 
works to its own undoing. All of the stories, in- 
terpreting the characters of the lower animals in 
terms of our own character as they do, have just 
claim to be considered literature in the fine sense 
of the word, the simplicity and sincerity of the 
author's style leaving the matter beyond doubt. A 
word should be said for the excellent illustrations 
which have been provided for the book by Messrs. 
Max F. Klepper, J. Carter Beard, Jay Hambidge, 
and Will H. Drake, rounding it oat into a thor- 
oughly worthy whole. 

The career ^^' Perry's "St. Louis," in Putnam's 

of St. Louu " Heroes of the Nations " series, 

of Prance. jg ^ straightforward account of the 

King who consecrated monarchy in France, making 
it in fact, as it was by tradition, the fountain of 
justice. To write a successful biography of one, 
the outlines of whose personality seem so familiar 
even if they are often actually vague, is not an easy 
task. The chief difficulty is one of proportion. 
During the minority of the King there were several 
feudal uprisings which at times seriously threatened 
the monarchy, and would have crippled it but for 
the energy and tact of his mother, Blanche of Cas- 
tile. If these are related with much detail, the 
reader is fatigued by the necessity of understanding 
the feudal geography of France. Moreover, he 
quite loses from sight the subject of the tale. At 
times it seems as if Mr. Perry had committed this 
fault. At least a more general treatment of the 
incidents of the Regency would have brought his 
readers more quickly to the subject they expect to 
study, — that is to say, Louis IX. himself, and the 
meaning of his career in the history of France. A 
similar difficulty arises in the treatment of the 
Crusades in which the King took part, although 
here it is not so great because these were manifes- 
tations of his own character. Mr. Perry's account 
of them is clear and interesting. It would have 
been fortunate had he given a proportionately 
greater attention to the development of institutions 
during the King's career, because this was even 
more characteristic of St. Louis as a monarch. The 
successes which he won against the barons were 
merely symptoms of the general change which in 
his day became evident and by which the monarchy 
began to dwarf even the greatest of the feudatories. 
Consequently the change itself, and not its symp- 
toms, should be the theme of such a work. 



An attraetive 

teriet of 

art monojfrapfu. 



The first four volumes of " The 
Artists' Library " (Longmans), pub- 
lished under the general editorship 
of Mr. Laurence Binyon, have been put forth, and 
may be said to supply a want which has long been 
felt by an art-loving public. Each of the volumes 
is the work of an accepted authority, and consists

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



of a biographical and critical discussion upon some 
painter of repute, followed by numerous reproduc- 
tions in half-tone and photogravure, or half-tone 
and color, of typical works from the artist's hand. 
The first volume of the series is by Mr. Charles 
Holme, and deals with the great Japanese popularly 
known as Hokusai. A general consideration of the 
pictorial art of Japan precedes this account of one 
of its most influential practitioners. Hokusai was 
born at Yedo in 1760, and after a life of vicissi- 
tude, marked throughout by a noble devotion to 
the true spirit of art, he died in his ninetieth year 
with the prayer, " If Heaven had only granted me 
five more years I could have become a real painter." 
The second volume, by Mr. Roger E. Fry, deals 
with Giovanni Bellini, and discusses the conditions 
existent in Venice previous to the artist's birth in 
1432. Bellini lived until 1516, dividing his years 
between the city of his birth and its appurtenant 
Padua. Mr. T. Sturge Moore has prepared the 
volume on Albrecht Altdorfer, born in Amberg 
about 1480, like Bellini the son of a painter of re- 
pute. He removed to Ratisbon, where he lived in 
ease and dignity until his death in 1538. The last 
of the four volumes now published deals with Fran- 
cisco Jos^ de Goya, whose work is sympathetically 
treated by Mr. W. Rothenstein. This distinguished 
painter was born in Fuendetodos, near Saragossa, in 
1746, of humble parentage. He was a born rebel, 
driven in early life from Madrid by his independ- 
ence of political and religious expression. He 
studied in Rome and returned to the Spanish capi- 
tal to be accepted as a leader by the younger men. 
Attaining all the honor possible in his native land, 
he went to Paris in 1822, aided in the great 
romantic movement then on foot in France, and 
died in Bordeaux in 1828. All the four painters 
treated of expressed themselves also as draughts- 
men or etchers, and examples of their work in all 
the media adopted add greatly to the value of the 
illustrations. These, it should be added, are numer- 
ous, not less than twenty in any instance. 

The great success which attended the 
ZlntJL i«««e of « The Butterfly Book " pre- 

sages a warm welcome to another 
volume of the series, "The Insect Book" (Double- 
day, Page & Co.), by Dr. L. 0. Howard, Chief of 
the Division of Entomology of the United States 
Department of Agriculture. It is a popular yet 
authoritative and quite comprehensive account of 
the ants, bees, wasps, grasshoppers, bugs, flies, and 
many other North American insects. This volume 
is especially rich in the natural history of these 
animals, and offers a mine of information concern- 
ing the wonderful facts of the insect world not pre- 
viously accessible to the general reader. Life- 
histories, habits, and the relations which insects 
bear to agriculture and other forms of industry, are 
copiously treated ; while the large field still await- 
ing investigation and unknown as yet even to 
scientists is constantly brought to the reader's 



notice. The book will thus bring a legitimate 
stimulus to the nature-study movement, and in its 
perspective of relative values and its maintenance 
of interest it may well serve as a model for writers 
who seek to popularize other fields of science. 
Simple directions for collecting and preserving in- 
sects, and keys for the determination of the larger 
groups, together with suggestive bibliographies and 
abundant illustrations, will assist those who wish to 
begin the study of insects with the aid of this book. 
The sixteen colored plates by the colorotype pro- 
cess, taken from the actual insects themselves, 
demonstrate the availability of this valuable pro- 
cess of illustration for other forms than butterflies. 
It is to be hoped that the Moth and the Beetle 
books will soon follow. 

A souvenir of ^r. Walter J. Wells's " Souvenir of 
England's most Sir Arthur SuUivan " (Mansfield) 
popular composer, jg ^ timely Contribution to the rapidly 
increasing library of musical literature. It is a 
good biography of the Boswellian sort, and though 
the author leaves to others the more attractive 
field of generalization, and contents himself with 
the grouping of facts, we are given a comprehen- 
sive view of the life of the most popular composer 
England has ever known. Sir Arthur was born of 
musical parents in London on May 13, 1842, and 
first came into public notice when fourteen years 
of age as the successful candidate for the Men- 
delssohn Scholarship at the Royal Academy. His 
career up to the time of the famous collaboration 
with W. S. Gilbert was that of many another strug- 
gling and ambitious composer. Then came the 
" Pinafore," — after which the career of Gilbert 
and Sullivan is too well known to bear repetition j 
yet in writing of the collaborators it seems difficult 
to avoid the temptation to digress into the endles* 
successes with which they were associated. Not- 
withstanding the success of his vocal works, in- 
cluding his well-known hymns, it is as a composer 
of orchestral music that Sir Arthur Sullivan will 
be remembered longest. The last work he ever 
composed, and which he finished almost on hi» 
death-bed, was a " Te Deum," intended to be sung^ 
at St. Paul's on the termination of the war in South 
Africa. The volume is handsomely printed andr 
adequately illustrated. 

Tke problems The first half of Mr. F. W. Headley's 

of applied "Problems of Evolution " (Crowell). 

Darwinism. deals with the well-known arguments 

for the truth of organic evolution as propounded 
by Darwin and elaborated by Wei8mann,the Neo- 
Darwinian leader of to-day. The author enforces 
his straightforward argument by many apt illus- 
trations and some new points of view, seeking 
throughout to maintain the supremacy of natural 
selection as the dominant force in the diversification 
of life, and discrediting the Lamarckian factors of 
exercise, environment, and effort. He also shows 
very lucidly the part that variation plays in the 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

drama of development, a part limited the more 
narrowly by heredity as evolution advances. In 
his later chapters the application is made to the 
problems of human progress, the argument being 
carried to its logical conclusion as regards conscious- 
ness, the moral sense, and religion. The physical 
degeneration of man which has resulted from the 
suspension in civilized life of the rigorous weeding 
process of natural selection, is counterbalanced by 
the higher morality attained ; and the author sug- 
gests that this physical degeneration may find its 
ultimate correction in the moral and religious mo- 
tives which will make the propagation of misery and 
weakness a sin. The great unprogressive people 
— the Chinese — will eventually, according to our 
author, take their place among civilized nations in 
accordance with this inevitable law of evolution. 
The tenor of the work is thus optimistic and whole- 
some, though vigorously partisan for one of the con- 
tending schools of evolutionary thought. It deals 
with some of the most pressing problems of the 
hour in terms of the prevailing mode of thought, 
and is a work of unusual power and attractiveness 
for the thinking reader.

dense and omit, for its purpose is 
not to present the field in detail, but to give a care- 
fully-proportioned general survey. A history, how- 
ever, not intended primarily as a textbook, and 
covering only part of the subject, should give a 
fairly-detailed outline, with quotations enough (at 
least from the less accessible material) to justify 
the author's estimate of its historical and intrinsic 
importance. Mr. James L. Onderdonk's " History 
of American Verse" (McClurg) too of ten assumes 
the reader's acquaintance with the originals, especi- 
ally in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 
The author has gone over the field with great care 
and thoroughness ; and his estimates, though they 
often fail to carry conviction because phrased in 
the humorously-meant circumlocutions of journal- 
istic English, are always careful, sensible, and in- 
dependent. If it is true, as another historian of 
American literature has lately said, that " current 
criticism tends perceptibly to depreciate our native 
literature," Mr. Onderdonk's interesting volume 
should help to counteract the tendency and to lead 
us to a juster view. 



A study m 
Hungarian 
romance. 



In " The Christian in Hungarian 
Romance " (Jas. H. West Co., Bos- 
ton) Mr. John Fretwell gives us, in 
the space of a little over a hundred pages, a sort 
of abstract of Maurus Jokai's novel, " There Is a 
God," together with such comment on the religious 
and social aspects of the life treated as seems to be 
called for. The novel is a setting of Unitarian 
purity and idealism in Transylvania against the 
background of Catholic corruption, worldliness, and 
insincerity as found in Rome and Vienna in the 



first half of the present century. Inevitably the story 
loses in vividness and dramatic power, and this 
study of a novel of purpose becomes valuable mainly 
for the light it throws on social and religious con- 
ditions in a part of the world with which we have 
been but little acquainted. A style with more of 
color would have helped in the telling ; but the 
mixture of politics, love, religion, and intrigue is 
interesting in spite of the baldness of the author's 
literary art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The standard sets of popular authors published by 
the Messrs. Crowell are now sixteen in number, and 
constitute a library of no less than one hundred and 
seventy- four volumes. These sets are noteworthy for 
their bimple tastef ulness of manufacture, their excellent 
editing, and their moderate price. They are all attrac- 
tively illustrated. The latest of these sets to be com- 
pleted by the publishers gives us a selection from the 
romances of Alexandre Dumas. There are ten volumes 
in all, including " Monte Cristo," the '« Musketeer " 
tales, and the " Valois " tales. Professor Adolphe Cohn 
contributes a general critical and biographical intro- 
duction to the series, and each separate romance has 
its own preface as well. Each volume has one photo- 
gravure and eight balf-tone illustrations. 

The important and useful series of books, eight in 
number, entitled " Periods of European History," 
(Macmillan) and edited by Mr. Arthur Hassall, is now 
completed by the publication of the volume, " Modern 
Europe, 1815-1899," by Mr. W. Allison PhilUps. We 
now have in this series a complete, compact, and read- 
able survey of the whole European history (England 
excluded), from the fall of the Western Empire to the 
close of the nineteenth century. 

A " Handy Dictionary of Prose Quotations," and a 
" Handy Dictionary of Poetical Quotations," both edited 
by Mr. George W. Powers, are two volumes of pocket- 
able size published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 
There is a key word for each quotation, and these words 
supply the basis of an alphabetical arrangement. Each 
volume has an index to authors and an index to the 
quotations given. " Who 's the Author," edited by Mr. 
Louis Harman Peet, is a companion to the two above- 
mentioned volumes, and gives, in alphabetical arrange- 
ment, the titles of thousands of American writings 
(including single poems), with the names of authors, 
the dates of publication, and frequently a line or two of 
characterization. It strikes us as a very useful little 
book. 

In producing a neat and inexpensive, set of " The 
Complete Works of John Keats," as edited by Mr. 
Harry Buxton Forman, the Messrs. Crowell have done 
a great service to all lovers of English literature. The 
edition is in five volumes, and is even more complete 
than the monumental four-volume library edition first 
published by Mr. Forman eighteen years ago. Since 
that time many important Keats papers have come to 
light, and these have been drawn upon for the present 
edition. In form, this set of books is a little like the 
" Temple Classics." The volumes have frontispieces 
and rubricated title-pages. The text is fairly legible, 
although we must say that the typography of the pre- 
faces and notes is a little trying for the eyes.

A complete and unabridged translation of Count 
Tolstoi's " Anna Karenina," made from the original 
Russian by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, will be issued at

In the familiar form and typography of the Bohn 
libraries, we have from the press of the Macmillan Co. 
a new issue, in three volumes, of Prescott's " Conquest 
of Mexico," as edited by Mr. John Foster Kirk. 

A second series of " Famous Actors of the Day in 
America," by Mr. Lewis C. Strang, is a companion to the 
similar volume on actresses recently mentioned in these 
columns, and is published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 

Dr. David Masson's " Chatterton," an essay now 
nearly fifty years old, has just been made into a book, 
with considerable revisions and extensions by its vener- 
able author, and is published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co. 

" The Personality of Thoreau," by Mr. F. B. Sanborn, 
is announced for publication in a finely-printed limited 
edition by Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed, Boston. The 
volume will include several verses by Thoreau hitherto 
unpublished. 

" England's Story," by Miss Eva March Tappan, is 
a school history for the intermediate grades — the kind 
of book with which to end the grammar school or begin 
the course in the high school. It is published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

The " Pocket Edition of Balzac," now being issued 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., is to fill thirty vol- 
umes, which may be purchased separately. The trans- 
lation is Miss Wormeley's, and the volumes have 
photogravure frontispieces. 

Mr. David Nutt of London has in preparation for 
early issue an edition of Sheridan's Plays, printed for 
the first time from the author's MSS., and edited by 
Mr. W. Eraser Rae. Sheridan's grandson, the Mar- 
quess of Dufferin and Ava, will contribute an Introduc- 
tion to the edition. 

" American Authors and Their Homes " is the title 
of an attractive volume just published by Messrs. James 
Pott & Co. The sketches, twenty-two in number, which 
make up the contents of this volume have been written 
by various hands, and originally appeared in the New 
York " Times." They have now been revised and ed- 



ited for this publication by Mr. Francis "Whiting Halsey, 
who was responsible for their original preparation. The 
volume has many illustrations, of both persons and 
places, and the subjects of the sketches are all living, 
with the single exception of John Fiske. 

The Oxford University Press is about to add to its 
" Oxford Poets " series Professor Skeat's complete 
edition of Chaucer, and a miniature volume of Brown- 
ing's " Dramatic Lyrics and Romances and Other 
Poems." The first two volumes of the Oxford India 
paper edition of Dickens will be issued at once. 

Miss Caroline B. Le Row's " English As She Is 
Taught," with its introduction by " Mark Twain," is an 
amusing little book that enjoyed a considerable vogue 
some fifteen years ago, and it was no doubt worth re- 
producing, as has recently been done by the Century 
Co. It may be recommended as a source of unfailing 
delight to its readers. 

The American agency for the sale of the publications 
issued by the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Antwerp has 
been secured by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
These publications consist, for the most part, of limited 
proofs in portfolio form of the copper and wood cuts 
originally used by the famous Plantin-Moretus family 
of printers, and now in the possession of the Museum. 

To the " Day's Work Series," published by Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co., five volumes have just been added. 
They are: "The Lonely God" and "A Strange Sin," 
both by Mr. Coulson Kernahan; "Consolation" and 
"Faith as Related to Health," both by Mr. William E. 
Barton; and "The Unknown Singers," which is a vol- 
ume of selections from the Psalms, made by the Rev. 
C. F. Dole. 

Dr. Windelband's " History of Philosophy," in the 
authorized translation of Professor James H. Tufts, has 
reached a second edition, which comes to us from the 
Macmillan Co. There are numerous revisions in the 
text, and the translator has added " a brief notice of 
certain aspects of recent English thought, which natur- 
ally have more interest for the readers of this transla- 
tion than for those of the original." 

" The Meditations, and Selections from the Principles 
of Ren^ Descartes " is a new volume in the " Religion 
of Science Library," sent us by the Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co. The translation is by Dr. John Veitch. 
These publishers are doing a highly valuable educa- 
tional work in thus making easily accessible the philo- 
sophical classics of the world, and their enterprise 
deserves generous recognition and support. 

There appears to be a distinct place for the new 
monthly periodical that Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
are just issuing. It is called " Country Life in America," 
is largely modelled upon the lines of a similar English 
publication, and is edited by Mr. Liberty H. Bailey. It 
appeals to everybody who lives in the country, even for 
a part of the year, and to everybody who wants to live 
in the country. The page is large, strikingly handsome 
in typography, and adorned with many illustrations. 

" A Bibliographical Contribution to the Study of 
John Ruskin " is a privately printed issue of the Cam- 
bridge Riverside Press. The work is by Miss M. Ethel 
Jameson, and represents a thesis presented to the school 
of Library Science in the University of Chicago. An 
outline sketch of Ruskin's life, and a few critical quo- 
tations, precede the bibliography proper, which fills 
nearly a hundred pages. The list of review articles is 
somewhat lengthy, and should prove particularly useful.

SOME EDITORIAL OPINIONS OF 
BRUSH AND PENCIL 



"Brush and Pencil is one of the best publica- 
tions devoted to art published to-day. Its articles 
are always in line with the accepted tenets of 
modern art, and its illustrated designs are of the 
most informing character." — Philadelphia Item. 

" The superlative excellence of the reflection of 
current arts and crafts by Brush and Pencil is 
always to be depended upon." — Boston Globe. 

"Brush and Pencil, the Chicago art maga- 
zine, is supplying a distinct want long felt by art 
students. There is a lack of literature dealing 
with the development and achievements of Ameri- 
can art, and this attractive publication is endeavor- 
ing to meet that need. Biographical and critical 
articles regularly appear, while reports of exhibi- 
tions, doings of art clubs, and art movetnents in 
all lines, are given space. It is typographically 
handsome, and its illustrations are admirable." — 
Indianapolis Journal. 

" A unique publication and one that will come 
as an aid in many ways to the schools." — JVew 
York Commercial Advertiser. 



" Brush and Pencil ranks with any magazine 
of art selling for the same price, or a little more 
even. While it is but 25 cents, it is not easy to see 
wherein it is specially weaker than the several 35- 
cent art magazines." — Hoboken Newsdealer. 

" Brush and Pencil is one of the best art 
magazines in the country, and a credit to Chicago." 
— The Epworth Herald. 

"Brush and, Pencil has been, since its incep- 
tion, an exemplification of that which is good, not 
only in the art graphic but in the art typographic." 
— Des Moines {Iowa) Ledger. 

"A valuable magazine for those interested in 
the progress and development of art and, while of 
interest to the artist, is not too far in advance of 
the needs of the student." — St. John's {N.F.) Globe. 

" The best-known artists lend their productions 
to this periodical and find perfect parallels in the 
excellent accompanying articles. Its appearance 
is an inspiration to new ideas and better work." — 
Book Notes.

RALPH CONNOR'S NEW NOVEL — His Most Conspicaous and Substantial Work 

THE MAN FROM GLENGARRY 

A Tale of the Great Northland 

12mo, Cloth, Decorated, $1.50 

' I UK baU million or more admirers of Ralph Comior'a inimitable minert of " Black Bock " and eovboy* of " The Sky Pilot " will giTe 
* cordial welcome to his lumbermen in " The Man from Olengarry." It is a wild scene in the Oreat Northland, its rough-hewn shanties 
and log-jams, but not so wild as the tumult in the hearts. The strong current of the river farther down was not more mighty in its peace 
than those same hearts under the influence of a woman, an angel of mercy to the hardy pioneers. 

Among them stands out in bold relief " The Man from Glengarry." At first a turbulent boy, whose sturdy Scotch blood boQs as did 
that of his Covenanter ancestors. The boy becomes a man. The sledge-hammer blows remain. The action is not less rigorous. He 
fights the great fight that strong men must put up if they would retain their manhood. The control of self develops the boyhood charm 
into a maturity of character which once known can never be forgotten. It is full of local color, and the types of Scottish Highlander, 
French Canadian, and American character form a vivid picture drawn by a master hand.

" DALPH CONNOR knows his ground welL He writes of the cowboy and frontier trader as living realities. ... He recognizes in 
1\ them traits which only the man who knows these men can depict. . . . This is no novel dealing with the rough existence of seem- 
ingly rough cowboys which can approach in the charm of its telling, its pathos and beautiful descriptions." — Stat Franeueo Btilietin. 

*' Ralph Connor's ' Black Rock ' was good, but ' The Sky Pilot ' is better. The matter which he gives us is real life ; virile, true, 
tender, humorous, pathetic, spiritual, wholesome. His style, fresh, crisp, and terse, accords with the Western life, which he under- 
stands. Henceforth the foothills of the Canadian Rockies will probably be associated in many a mind with the name of ' Ralph Connor.' " 

— The awtooi(N.T.) 
" Ralph Connor uses a pen dipped in the very colors and tones of the canyon and sunlit hills. ... It touches just the chords which 
vibrate luxuriously in the popular heart." — Sotton Transcript.

Tristram of Blent anthonyhope 

IN WHICH FATHER TIME PLAYS A PART 

A story of modern England in which the twelve days' difference between the Russian and English cal- 
endars, affecting in turn a marriage, a birth, and the ownership of lands, furnishes the complications for a 
most unique plot. Not since " The Prisoner of Zenda " has Anthony Hope written anything so strong, so 
original. Never before has he portrayed character with such keen discrimination. W. L. Alden says in the 
New York Times : " • Tristram of Blent ' is certainly a book which deserves to be read. It shows a wonderful 
insight into character, and it is full of the brilliant and subtle conversation in which Mr. Hope so easily 
excels his rivals." 

The Westerners stewart edward white 

TELLING A TALE OF THE BLACK HILLS 

Well-told tales of the frontier will always appeal to American readers. Here is one which deals with 
a picturesque and little-known land in a decade when the mining fever was at its height. Such a period 
signifies variety, excitement, striking characters, an abundance of local color. " The Westerners " contains 
all of these. 

Jack Rucer henry somerville 

• ' iirUCING ONE OF THE MOST LIKABLE CHAPS IN FICTION 

"- "rhis story of a typical small town of the West and its typical people is as bright and breezy as the 

name itself. Jack Racer is a refreshing, happy-go-lucky chap, a hearty winner every day in the week. The 
book is a little lesson in optimism. 

Irish Pastorals shan f. bullock 

PORTRAYING THE LIFE OF THE IRISH PEASANTRY 

Mr. Bullock is doing a great work both for literature and for the hardworking plodders of his own 
land in his sympathetic sketches of the Irish peasantry. His new stories, " Irish Pastorals," depict within 
a life more rigorous than we can realize abundant elements of keen native wit, irrepressible good nature, 
and shrewd practical wisdom. 

By Bread Alone / k. friedman 

GIVING AN INSIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY 

Seldom has a book been more fittingly introduced by current events. The toiling life of the steel- 
workers amid the loming scenes of a great foundry, a bitter labor struggle, a love story which softens the 
rigor of it all, afford a theme which is rich in possibilities which the author has realized.

Twelve Important New Books 



Warwick of the Knobs 

By JOHN URI LLOYD, author of "Stringtown on the Pike," etc. 12mo, cloth, illustrated, $1.60. 
A powerful tale of "Stringtown" (Boone) County, Kentucky. The action takes place during the Civil War, when the 
Kentucky Knobs were on the border line between the contending factions and the people were divided in their allegiance. 
The Great Confederate leader Morgan figures in the story. 



The Lady of Lynn 

By Sir WALTER BESANT, author of " The Orange Girl," 

etc. 12mo, cloth, illustrated, $1.50. 

The lady of Lynn is a young heiress. During her long minority it 
had been the aim of her guardian to keep the knowledge of his ward's 
wealth a secret, that she might not fall a prey to fortune-hunters. A 
conspiracy against her is carried out, apparently with success, but she 
is finally rescued. 



Light Freights 



By W. W. JACOBS, author of " Many Cargoes," etc. 12nio 

cloth, $1.50. 

These delinations of the life of the sailorman, both ashore and 
afloat, show most convincingly his manner of life, his trials, his pleas- 
ures, and bis point of view. The book is justly considered the best 
work that Mr. Jacobs has done along this line, and he already has some 
excellent work to his credit. 



The Lion's Whelp 



By AMELIA E. BARR, author of " A Bow of Orange Ribbon," etc. 12mo, cloth, illustrated, $l.-50. 
A romance having to do with the fortunes of two families during the English civil war. The story brings Oliver Crom- 
well, "The Lion's Whelp," in close touch with the reader, and leaves a vivid impression of his greatness of character not 
easily effaced. 



Young Barbarians 

By IAN MACLAREN, author of "The Bonnie Brier Bush." 
12mo, cloth, illustrated, 81.36 net. (Postage extra.) 
A charming story of school life in Muirtown ; among other things, 
showing how the French " Count," a lonely man in a foreign land, con- 
quered the prejudice, specially strong in Scotch hearts, against his race, 
80 that when he died he was followed to his grave by every boy at 
Muirtown Seminary. 



A Dream of Empire 

By WILLIAM HENRY VENABLE. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" This volume should take high rank among American historical 
novels. Aaron Burr was a dramatic character, and this book gives a 
most vivid and interesting picture of him and his associates. The story 
is well planned and executed, and there is a touch of adventure about 
it that is delightful." — Worcester Spy. 



The History of Sir Richard Calmady 

By LUCAS MALET (Mrs. St. Leger Harrison), author of "The Wages of Sin," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50 

This is a frankly realistic romance, the scene of which is laid in Hampshire, in London, and in Naples. The action deals 
with the adventures of an English country gentleman of an essentially normal type of character subjected to very abnormal 
conditions of life. The long drama, though tragic in incident, ends amid such secure happiness as should satisfy the most 
exacting reader. 



The Shoes of Fortune 

By NEIL MUNRO, author of "John Splendid," "Qilian 

the Dreamer," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

A tale of charactor and adventure, the period being 1755. The 
hero inherits from his uncle his diary and the so-called Shoes of For- 
tune, which are credited by the nephew with magic qualities of inspi- 
ration and stimulation. They play a curious part in all that follows. 



NorselStories 



By HAMILTON W. MABIE. Revised edition, with illus- 
trations, in colors, making a most attractive children's gift 
book. 12mo, cloth, $1.80 net. (Postage extra.) 
Mr. Mabie has here retold, with all the charm of which he is mas- 
ter, the old stories of the battles of the gods and the giants which have 
been repeated for hundreds of years by the Norse firesides in the long 
winter evenings. 



A Child of Nature 

By HAMILTON W. MABIE. Handsomely illustrated. Small 8vo, cloth, $1.80 net. (Postage extra.) 

A descriptive story of the life of a man of poetic nature with the gift of imagination, who ripens in close companionship 
with nature into a beautiful and rare character, but without the faculty of expression ; whose]|genius'is,tin the end, inter- 
preted and expressed by one who enters into his experience and gives his thought form and shape for the world. 



Love Idylls 



By S. R. CROCKETT, author of " Cinderella," etc. 12mo, 

cloth, $1.50. 

A portrayal of some of the varying phases of the " divine passion," 
a theme of which this old world has never grown weary and never will. 
The characters offer a great variety, but cannot fail to come close to 
the heart of every reader, since " all the world loves a lover." 



Love the Harvester 



8vo, 



By MAX PEMBERTON, author of "Pro Patria," etc. 

cloth, illustrated, $1.50. 

A story of the days when George the Third was King, showing how 
Mistress Nancy Dene outwitted her cousin, who had schemed to de- 
fraud her of her property, and in the end found herself not only mis- 
tress of Belton Abbey but of the heart of Master Jack Danvers as well.

A Story of American Politics. 

Mr. Barr has produced a novel of politics in the West which 
shows the richness of a field comparatively undeveloped. The 
evolution of his central figure, who passes throngli various stages as 
clerk, lobbyist, legislator, and Governor, is sketched with a graphic 
realism which is absolutely convincing.

12mo. Cloth. $1.50. 



Mr. Brady stands at the head of contemporary writers of sea 
romances. This is the first novel of the sea that he has written for 
over two years, and it is the longest and most picturesque and 
stirring tale which he has offered to the public. He has opened a 
fresh field, in which readers will meet " the great Lord Hawke " 
and his picturesque environments for the first time, it is believed, 
in fiction. " The Quiberon Touch " is not only delightful history, 
but it brings with it the genuine savor of the salt and the very 
breath of the waves.

Maarten Maartens is recognized by all readers of fiction as one 
of the most artistic and finished novelists of the day, and he has 
done nothing that shows certain fine characteristics of his work 
better than this gallery of charmingly executed miniatures. These 
stories indicate character, relations, environments, the development 
of incidents, with a lightness and grace of a true artist. The adroit- 
ness of these tales is never suffered to overshadow the real quality 
of human interest. " Some Women " is a book that will enhance 
the fine reputation earned by the author of "God's Fool " and " The 
Greater Glory."

Julien Gordon's new story of modern society is in her most brill- 
iant vein. Glimpses of social life in New York are accompanied by 
vivid pictures of political life and society in Washington. Her novel 
is a story of the world of fashion and intrigue, written with an in- 
sight, epigrammatic force, and a realization of the dramatic and 
the pathetic as well as more superficial phases of life, that stamp 
the book as one immediate and personal in its interest and convinc- 
ing in its appeal to the minds and to the sympathies of readers.

WOMAN A ND T HE ESSAY. 

At first thought, it might seem that if there 
is one field of literature more than another in 
which women are likely to excel, that field 
would be the light essay. But the facts show 
precisely the contrary. There is no lack of 
articles, profound, clever, and able, written by 
women on all manner of subjects. Miss Scud- 
der, Mrs. Deland, Mrs. Van Rensselaer, and 
Mrs. Sangster, are but a few out of the many 
American women whose names come readily 
to mind as writers of philosophical, historical, 
biographical, or practical papers. But for 
critical essays m light vein, such as those of 



Mr. Lang, Mr. Gosse, Mr. Howells, and Mr. 
Matthews, or for those on life and society cor- 
responding to the essays of Stevenson, or to 
the short papers of George William Curtis, 
Charles Dudley Warner, and Mr. Higginson, 
we shall look in vain among women writers. 
We have, in truth, no women essayists. 

Miss Repplier might perhaps be cited as an 
exception ; but though undeniably clever, she 
is overweighted by her voluminous reading, 
and lacks both of the indispensable qualities of 
the essayist. For whether the essay be as keen 
in insight and as subtle in interpretation as 
Pater's on Leonardo da Vinci, or as simple as 
Warner's in the " Editor's Drawer," its essen- 
tial charms are to be looked for in the indi- 
viduality and style of the writer. In other 
forms of literature the author may project his 
work from himself, and literary finish is not so 
indispensable ; but the essay must have the 
flavor of personality and the distinction of 
style. In both of these requisites the work of 
women is lacking. There are no papers writ- 
ten by women in which we feel the attraction 
of individuality, and no woman has yet written 
in the English language who can be said to 
have literary style in the sense in which it can 
fairly be claimed for fifty or more men among 
living or recent writers. 

Do we find such slight indications of per- 
sonality in the writings of women because they 
have less individuality than men ? A writer 
in one of the leading periodicals a few years 
ago was at some pains to prove this to be the 
ease. But granting a measure of truth in the 
hypothesis, there are other possible explana- 
tions for the fact that women show little per- 
sonality in their writings. 

Women are at once more self-conscious and 
more conventional than men. They may be 
spontaneous and individual in an intimate cor- 
respondence, but in anything more public they 
rarely show their real selves freely and natur- 
ally. Probably the desire for self-revelation 
is stronger in women than in men, but there is 
always a pose in conscious efforts to communi- 
cate one's self, whether the striver be a Marie 
Bashkirtseff or a Rousseau. It is only when, 
in self-forgetfulness, one says straight out what 
he genuinely thinks and feels, that he becomes

personally interesting. This, women never do, 
and apparently cannot do. They do not seem 
to know how to let go of themselves, and either 
practice severe self-repression, or else they at- 
titudinize, or become unduly confidential and 
familiar with their public. 

Probably another reason why the short, 
bright essay, dealing cleverly with men and 
things, is not written by women, lies in the 
incompatibility between the feminine tempera- 
ment and the tone of the essay. Women are 
by nature partisans. They take themselves 
and their views too seriously to handle a sub- 
ject with humor and impartiality. The attitude 
of the disinterested spectator is impossible to 
the sex. Rarely do we find a woman who is 
both a keen and a tolerant observer of life. In 
fact, the knowledge of life which constitutes 
the recognized background of the essayist is 
wanting in women. They may, through social 
settlements and charity organizations, come to 
know " how the other half lives "; but that is 
quite a different thing from knowledge of life. 

The lack of literary style among women 
writers, which would hinder a compiler of a 
book of model prose extracts for analysis from 
making a selection from the work of any 
woman, is largely due to causes already men- 
tioned. If the style is the man, individuality 
in style cannot be separated from individuality 
in thought. Women frequently are fluent, 
easy, and graceful in expression, but they sel- 
dom attain a distinguishing any more than a 
distinguished style. When they attempt to be 
serious or profound, they are usually labored ; 
when, on the other hand, they essay the light 
touch, they become flippant and diffuse. The 
easy conversational tone degenerates with them 
into triviality, through lack of being subjected 
to the rigid control of good taste. 

Undoubtedly a choice diction and fine liter- 
ary finish do not come to anyone by nature. 
They are achieved only with infinite pains. 
Women, as a rule, are not willing to exercise 
the tireless patience necessary to acquire the 
little touches that distinguish the artistic from 
the commonplace use of language. Conse- 
quently they are never artists in the use of 
words. These are at least among the reasons 
why women, though they may excel as writers 
of fiction, history, biography, travel, of prac- 
tical and theoretical articles of all sorts, and of 
clever sketches, are not as yet contributing 
anything worthy of mention to the most finished 
of all forms of prose literature. 

Edith Dickson. 



SOME EARLY ANTI-SLAVERY 
PUBL ICAT IONS. 

A few months ago a writer in The Dial took 
Professor Barrett Wendell to task for omitting to 
mention in his " Literary History of America " 
Mrs. Lydia Maria Child's book, issued in 1833, 
entitled " An Appeal for that Class of Americans 
called Africans," which he claimed was incontestably 
" the first Anti-Slavery book published in America."* 
Knowing that there were a number of earlier anti- 
slavery books, I have made a point of picking them 
up as rapidly as I have run across their titles in the 
catalogues of second-hand booksellers. A rough 
list of " Anti-Slavery Publications from 1750 to 
1863," compiled by the Rev. Samuel May, Jr., was 
added to the " Report of the Third Decade Meet- 
ing of the American Anti-Slavery Society," and a 
list of publications before 1835 is given by General 
William Birney as an appendix to his " Life of 
James G. Birney." Notices of the earlier anti- 
slavery publications may be found in the " Life of 
Garrison " by his sons, and in other similar works. 
The test of what constitutes a book is somewhat 
arbitrary ; but, in the popular sense, any publica- 
tion bound in board covers is a book. 

Passing over a number of sermons and tracts 
belonging to the Colonial period, the earliest original 
anti-slavery book published in the United States ap- 
pears to have been a little 16mo, issued in Philadel- 
phia in 1816, entitled " The Book and Slavery Irre- 
concilable," by the Rev. George Bourne. It might 
be questioned whether this may properly be called an 
American book, as the author was born in England ; 
but it was certainly " an anti-slavery book published 
in America." This book was the source of many of 
the most telling phrases afterward used by Garrison. 
Little biographical information respecting Bourne 
is now accessible. There is a short notice of him in 
Appletons' " Cyclopaedia of American Biography," 
but most of the statements contained in it appear to 
be erroneous. He came to America early in the 
century, and encountered the institution of Slavery 
during a residence in Maryland and Virginia. Per- 
secution finally drove him to Canada, whence he 
returned and in 1832 settled in New York, where 
he engaged in editorial work until his death in 1845. 
He continued writing against slavery to the end of 
his life. A book by him entitled " Pictures of 
Slavery in the United States," published in 1834, 
was illustrated by curious wood-cuts of " Selling 
Females by the Pound," " Ladies Whipping Girls," 
and the like. 

In 1817, two more anti-slavery publications were 
issued. The first was not a book but a little tract 
of 59 pages, issued in blue paper wrappers at 
Cambridge, Mass. It was entitled " Horrors of 
Slavery: In Two Parts," by John Kenrick of 
Newton, Mass. It contained no original matter. 
Part I. consisted of extracts from parliamentary

speeches taken from Clarkson's " History of the 
Abolition of the Slave Trade," and Part II. was 
made up of opinions of various American and 
foreign writers respecting slavery. Among the 
extracts is one from a pamphlet to which I find 
no other reference. It was written by Jarvis Brew- 
ster, entitled " An Exposition of the Treatment of 
Slaves in the Southern States," and printed at New 
Brunswick, N. Y., in 1815. Kenrick caused a 
copy of his tract to be laid upon the desk of every 
U. S. Senator and Member of Congress. The 
second anti-slavery publication of this year was 
entitled " Portraiture of Domestic Slavery in the 
United States," by Jesse Torrey, Jr., an octavo of 
94 pages, bound in boards and issued in Phila- 
delphia. The book describes a trip from Pittsburg 
to Washington, and the abuse of slaves that was 
witnessed en route. The author was a physician, 
who wrote a number of books upon other subjects, 
the titles of which are given by AUibone. Kenrick's 
tract and Torrey's book were both denounced in a 
speech delivered in the Senate March 6, 1818, by 
Wm. Smith of South Carolina. 

The next anti-slavery book was entitled '' A 
Treatise on Slavery," by the Rev. James Duncan, 
printed at Vevay, Indiana, in 1824. I have not 
seen a copy of the original edition, but a reprint 
issued in 1840, by the American Anti-Slavery 
Society, makes a closely-printed little book of 136 
pages. It is written in the dry and formal style 
of the old-time sermon. Very little can be learned 
of the author. The editor of the reprint says that 
he had intended to give a biographical sketch of 
him, but had mislaid the notes for it. 

In 1826 a little book entitled " Letters on Ameri- 
can Slavery " was published by the Rev. John 
Rankin at Ripley, Ohio. The letters were very vio- 
lent in tone, and became extremely popular with the 
radical abolitionists. Garrison reprinted them in 
the second volume of " The Liberator," and they 
afterwards ran through half a dozen editions. Its 
author continued a vigorous war against slavery 
until the victory was achieved. 

One other book that should be mentioned here 
is a " Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery in 
the Several States of the United States," by Mr. 
George M. Stroud, the first edition of which, pub- 
lished in Philadelphia in 1827, made an octavo of 
180 pages. This book is still extremely interesting 
and instructive reading. Though not professedly 
an anti-slavery book, it is strongly imbued with 
anti-slavery principles, and in its plain statement 
of leg^ conditions constitutes to the mind of the 
present-day reader a much stronger indictment of 
slavery than the more direct attacks upon the in- 
stitution. The author was Judge of the Circuit 
Court of the City and County of Philadelphia. 

The next anti-slavery book issued in the United 
States was Mrs. Child's work, an able book and 
longer than its predecessors, but certainly not " the 
first anti-slavery book published in America." The 
main point is that the rise of anti-slavery sentiment 



in the United States was due not to any one person 
or coterie of persons, but to a very large number 
of people working independently in different parts 
of the country, most of them not writing for 
publication but using their influence in public and 
private station in furtherance of the cause. Inci- 
dentally it may be remarked that a great deal of 
work still remains to be done upon the history of 
the beginnings of the anti-slavery movement in

COMMUNICA TION. 



MR. FREDERIC HARRISON AS A CRITIC OF 

TENNYSON. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Mr. Frederic Harrison, in bis essay on Tennyson in 
his recent volume of " Literary Estimates," says of " Itt 
Memoriam": "Indeed, with all its art, melody, and 
charm, we see from time to time in < In Memoriam ' a 
little too visibly the ' sad mechanic exercise ' which is 
the Lnevitabie result of too rigid and prolonged devotion 
to the uses of ' measured language.' " 

That would do very well, alone; but a little farther 
on in the same essay Mr. Harrison seems so to alter his- 
opinion as to speak of " Tennyson's religions and philo- 
sophical pieces (especially < In Memoriam,' the most 
perfect of his poems), because his claim to rank as the 
supreme poet of the nineteenth century must rest on this if 
on anything." And a little farther on still, he says: 
" It is a far happier task to turn to the more distinctly 
lyrical work of Tennyson — that whereon his permanent 
fame must abide." The italics, in both cases, are mine. 

Now, it seems to me that most admirers of Tennyson 
will agree with Mr. Harrison in his latter statement; 
but it is hard for them to understand his singular dis- 
agreement with himself. In two different books, or 
even in two different essays in the same book, such con- 
tradictions of view might be excused on the ground of 
changed views (" I do not let what I think to-day keep 
me from thinking what I ought to-morrow"). Bat in 
the same essay they cannot be allowed to pass unchal- 
lenged, — especially as Mr. Harrison's Tennyson " esti- 
mate " is full of " this sort of thing." 

Another example may perhaps suffice. Mr. Harrison, 
having spoken of Tennyson as " the supreme poet of 
the nineteenth century," surprises ns by remarking, a 
little later on : " It may be doubted if his ultimate 
place in our literature will at all overtop that of Burns, 
Wordsworth, Byron, or Shelley." In the name of 
" serious, patient, and absolutely impartial criticism,"^ 
it may be asked what Bams is doing in such high com- 
pany. Barns is a minor poet of very genuine if very 
limited merit, but he has no claim to a place among the 
" far-darters " of " the peaks of song." Concerning the 
ratings of the other three, competent critics would have 
us believe that it will be " merely a matter of opinion "■ 
for a score of years at least. 

If the fame of Tennyson's lyrics is " that whereon 
his permanent fame must abide," it may be well to dis- 
cover which of those lyrics are of greatest worth. Mr. 
Harrison says: "Above all others are the songs in 'The 
Brook,' ' The Princess,' and in • Maud.' " I cannot 
think that " the concensus of critical opinion " agrees 



312

[Nov. 1» 



with these dicta of Mr. Harrison. He speaks of " the 
songs in < The Brook,' " but after an exhaustive search 
through the ten volumes of the definitive edition of 
Tennyson, I can find but one song in " The Brook." 
This, it is true, is broken into several parts. Mr. Har- 
rison, as a critic, should be more careful in his state- 
ments. The song in "The Brook" is charming; but is 
it very much more? Or rather, is it as much more 
than charming as are many others of Tennyson's lyrics? 
In fact, I think it the very slightest in merit of Tenny- 
son's twenty or twenty-five best lyrics. The songs in 
"The Princess," — "The Splendor Falls on Castle 
Walls," "Tears, Idle Tears," "O Swallow, Swallow," 
" Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal," and " Come Down, 
O Maid," — are of course delightful lyrics; that almost 
goes without saying, since they are Tennyson's lyrics. 
But, even admitting that they are in the first rank of 
Tennyson's lyrics, are they, in the language of the 
Oxford schools, such " good firsts " as the lyrics " A 
Farewell," "Choric Song," "Far — Far Away," "In 
the Valley of Cauteretz," " Requiescat," " Sir Galahad," 
" Crossing the Bar," " The Deserted House," and " The 
Silent Voices"? The songs in "The Princess," Mr. 
Harrison says, " are most bewitching." That is true, — 
but Tennyson at his lyric best is more than that. 

Mr. Harrison speaks of " Ulysses " as one of the 
" Idylls." It, and " Vastness," are the two poems of 
Tennyson which most evade classification. It is of 
course easy to classify and measure after this fashion. 
It is more difficult to classify and measure correctly. 
If Mr. Harrison gave more attention to helping " the 
reader who wants criticism," both writer and reader 
would be better off. 

Mr. Harrison quotes the first line of " Despair " — 

*' la it you that preach'd in the chapel there looking over the 

sand?" 
And says: " This is not poetry, with 16 syllables and 
52 letters in the line." It is true that this line is not 
utter poetry, but not especially because it contains 16 
syllables and 52 letters. It would probably be neither 
better nor worse poetry if it contained 49 letters, or 63 
letters. Perhaps, if the line were printed, 

" la it you that preach'd in the chapel, 
There, looking over the sand ? " 

Mr. Harrison would have less trouble in deciphering 
what poetic quality it possesses. Yet where is the essen- 
tial difference? I think the difficulty Mr. Harrison 
says one ought to find in reading this line of " 16 syl- 
lables " is chiefly non-existent. Mr. Harrison also finds 
fault because Tennyson has so many monosyllables in 
his poetry, and so few polysyllables. But so long as 
the result is poetry, one doesn 't care whether the words 
are long-syllabled or short-syllabled. If the result is 
not poetry, one ought not to care much about it, either. 

With such futilities as these does Mr. Harrison 
regale us in his essay on Tennyson, Such captious 
dissections, and philological peckings, are but the tin- 
soldiery of literary criticism. Some there are who give 
us "this sort of thing" because they cannot give us 
real literary criticism. Less often we are confronted 
by cases in which a critic persists in this minute method 
because he is of the opinion that it is " scientific." Mr. 
Frederic Harrison can write good criticism, and he does 
write it elsewhere in this volume; but the essay on 
Tennyson is " of little worth."

James Russell. Lowell,.* 



" I am richer than he thinks for," Lowell 
once wrote to his friend Briggs, apropos of a 
recent notice which had intimated that the 
young poet was in easy circumstances. " I am 
the first poet who has endeavored to express 
the American Idea, and I shall be popular by 
and by. Only I suppose I must be dead first. 
But I do not want anything more than I have." 
These words were written in the annus mira- 
bilis of Lowell's youth, the year which pro- 
duced " The Fable for Critics," " The Biglow 
Papers," and " The Vision of Sir Launfal." 
It is as the poet of the American Idea, so nobly 
expressed in these early writings, and even 
more nobly in some of the later ones, that we 
cherish the memory of Lowell, and turn to him, 
rather than to any other, for cheer and conso- 
lation in such a time as our own, when the 
Idea upon which he had fixed his faith seems 
to have become submerged beneath a flood of 
corruption, self-seeking ambition, and the cyn- 
ical disregard of our national obligations. It 
may be urged that the American Idea, as Lowell 
voiced it, was nothing more than the New 
England Idea, or the Puritan Idea, but we are 
of those who believe that the best expression 
thus far given to Americanism in its finer 
sense is the expression given it by the group 
of New England writers who for many years 
held the national conscience so largely in their 
keeping, and of whom Lowell was at once the 
raciest and the most deeply imbued with those 
moral principles which are the only real basis 
of our national greatness. And it is because 
in these dark recent days those principles seem 
to have lost their old-time hold upon our na- 
tional life that we listen more yearningly than 
ever for some echo of the voice that thrilled 
with indignation in " The Biglow Papers " and 
with the pride of American manhood in the 
great ode consecrated to the sacred memory of 
Abraham Lincoln. 

It is now ten years since the death of Lowell 
bereft us, not merely of our foremost man of 
letters, but of our foremost man. While he 
was yet with us, the story of his life had been 
in many ways an open book, and since his 
death, our knowledge of that life has received

large accessions. First in importance among 
these accessions stands, of course, the collection 
of Lowell's letters, as edited by Professor Nor- 
ton. These volumes gave us so intimate a view 
of the man himself, as apart from his books, 
that they in a measure made a formal biog- 
raphy seem unnecessary. At least, they en- 
abled us to wait patiently the appearance of 
such a biography, knowing that when it did 
appear it could hardly alter the main outlines 
of the portrait that had already been drawn 
for us. Nevertheless, the biography, as we now 
have it, is a welcome contribution to the his- 
tory of American literature and of American 
manhood, and the discreet sympathy which Mr. 
Seudder has brought to its preparation deserves 
our warmest gratitude. The previous publica- 
tion of the " Letters " has mainly determined 
the lines of the present biography. Concern- 
ing this matter, Mr. Seudder says : 

" If they had not been published, I might have made 
a ' Life and Letters ' which would have been in the 
main Lowell's own account of himself, in his voluminons 
correspondence, annotated only by such further aecouat 
of him as his letters failed to supply. As it is, though 
I have had access to a great many letters not contained 
in Mr. Norton's work, I have thought it desirable not 
so much to supplement the < Letters ' with other letters, 
as to complement those volumes with a more formal 
biography, using such letters or portions of letters as I 
print for illustration of my subject, rather than as the 
basis of the narrative." 

Having thus introduced what is probably the 
most important publication of the present year, 
it remains for us to illustrate its quality by a 
few extracts, and to call attention to a few of 
its more noticeable features. 

When Lowell had got through with college, 
and, among other experimental ventures, started 
♦' The Pioneer," he wrote a prospectus which 
shows how serious were his aims thus early in 
his career. The object of the new periodical, 
we read, was to furnish the public 
" With a rational substitute for the enormous quantity 
of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby 
love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to 
them by many of our popular magazines, — and to offer 
instead thereof, a healthy and manly Periodical Litera- 
ture, whose perusal will not necessarily involve a loss 
of time and a deterioration of every moral and intel- 
lectual faculty." 

If such things might fairly be said sixty years 
ago, what language would be adequate to de- 
scribe the state of things existing to-day, both 
in America and England, as respects the peri- 
odical literature which really enjoys a popular 
vogue I 

As we all know, political passion became at 
an early age as important an element in Low- 



ell's being as literary passion, and his inde- 
pendent attitude toward political questions 
receives constant expression in his writing 
when still a young man. Given the approval 
of his own conscience, and he cared not how 
many were leagued against him, or how for- 
midable were the forces which he had to com- 
bat. How characteristic of the whole man is 
this satirical comment upon the time-serving 
politicians of the forties : 

" The word xo," he wrote, " is the shibboleth of poli- 
ticians. There is some malformation or deficiency in 
their vocal organs which either prevents their uttering 
it at all, or gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be 
unintelligible. A month filled with the national pud- 
ding, or watering in the expectation of it, is wholly in- 
competent to this perplexing monosyllable. One might 
imagine that America had been colonized by a tribe of 
those nondescript African animals, the Aye Ayes. As 
Pius Ninth has not yet lost his popularity in this coun- 
try by issuing a bull against slavery, our youth, who are 
always ready to hurrah for anything, might be practised 
in the formation of the refractory negative by being 
encouraged to shout Viva Pio Nono." 

The culmination of Lowell's application of lit- 
erature to politics was reached, of course, with 
the publication of that memorable masterpiece 
of satirical hamor, the first series of "The 
Biglow Papers." What Mr. Seudder says of 
the work is so just and discriminating that it 
deserves quotation. 

" The force which Lowell displayed in this satire 
made his book at once a powerful ally of a sentiment 
which heretofore had been crassly ridiculed; it turned 
the tables and put Anti-slavery, which had been fight- 
ing sturdily on foot with pikes, into the saddle, and 
gave it a flashing sabre. For Lowell himself it won an 
accolade from King Demos. He rose up a knight, and 
thenceforth possessed a freedom which was a freedom 
of nature, not a simple badge of service in a single 
cause. The book in its fullest meaning is an expression 
of Lowell's personality, and has in it the essence of 
New England. The character of the race from which 
its author sprang is preserved in its vernacular and in 
the characters of the dramatis personal. Not unwit- 
tingly, but in the full consciousness of his own inherit- 
ance, Lowell became the spokesman of a racy people, 
whose moral force bad a certain acrid quality, and, when 
thrown to the winds, as in the person of Birdofredom 
Sawin, was replaced by an insolent shrewdness. Nor 
is the exemplification of New England less complete for 
that infusion of homely sentiment and genuine poetic 
sensibility which underlie and penetrate the sturdy 
moral force." 

Lowell's course of lectures given at the 
Lowell Institute during the winter of 1854-55 
marked a sort of turning-point in his career. 
They not only led to more lectures elsewhere, 
but they also led to the recognition of Lowell's 
peculiar fitness to succeed Longfellow at Har- 
vard. College lecturing, as he shaped it, was 
much to his taste, which cannot be said of the 



314 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



public and itinerant lecturing of his apprentice- 
ship to the art. " I hate this business of lec- 
turing," he wrote from Wisconsin. 

" To be received at a bad inn by a solemn commit- 
tee, in a room with a stove that smokes but not exhil- 
arates, to have three cold fish-tails laid in your hand 
to shake, to be carried to a cold lecture-room, to read 
a cold lecture to a cold audience, to be carried back to 
your smoke-side, paid, and the three fish-tails again — 
well, it is not delightful exactly." 

But lecturing at Harvard, in his own way and 
on a subject that he liked, was a different 
matter, and he cannot have failed to receive 
some reflex influence from the inspiration that 
he gave year after year, to his classes of eager 
students. Here is a description of his way of 
dealing with Dante, upon whom he lectured 
for many years : 

« The classes were not large, and the relation of the 
teacher to his students was that of an older friend who 
knew in a large way the author they were studying, 
and drew upon his own knowledge and familiarity with 
the text for comment and suggestion, rather than 
troubled himself much to find out how much his pupils 
knew. A student would trudge blunderingly along 
some passage, and Lowell would break in, taking up 
the translation himself very likely, and quickly find 
some suggestion for criticism, for elaboration, or inci- 
dental and remote comment. Toward the close of the 
hour, question and answer, or free discussion yielded 
to the stream of personal reminiscence or abundant 
reflection upon which Lowell would by this time be 
launched. Especially would he recall scenes in Flor- 
ence, sketch in words the effects of the Arno, Giotto's 
Tower, the church in which Dante was baptized, where 
he himself had seen children held at the same font; 
and so Lowell gave out of his treasures, using that form 
of literature which was perhaps the most perfectly 
fitted to his mind, free, unconstrained talk." 

For the formalities of academic work, however, 
he had little concern. Mr. Barrett Wendell 
tells the following anecdote of an academic 
exercise : 

" Weeks passed, and no news came of our marks. 
At last one of the class, who was not quite at ease con- 
cerning his academic standing, ventured at the close of 
a recitation to ask if Mr. Lowell had assigned him a 
mark. Mr. Lowell looked at the youth very gravely, 
and inquired what he really thought his work deserved. 
The student rather diffidently said that he hoped it 
was worth sixty per cent. • You may take it,' said Mr. 
Lowell, ' I don't want the bother of reading your book.' " 

This reminds us of a story of Walter Pater in 
his character as a college teacher. He also, 
when questioned concerning his neglected 
marking of a set of themes, found a sufficient 
answer in the observation, " They did not 
greatly impress me." 

It is from Lowell's " Atlantic " period that 
the following example of his humor is taken : 

" Just as Lowell's fun could find its way even into 



an index, so in his sober criticisms he would sometimes 
hide a jest for the delectation of especially discerning 
readers, as when in his article on White's Shakespeare, 
he remarks incidentally: * To every commentator who 
has wantonly tampered with the text, or obscured it 
with his inky cloud of paraphrase, we feel inclined to 
apply the quadrisyllable name of the brother of Agis, 
king of Sparta.' Felton, Longfellow tells us in a letter 
to Sumner, was the first to unearth the joke and to 
remember or discover that this name was Eudamidas.'*' 

Lowell was in charge of the " Atlantic " for 
about four years. The most distinguished of 
a distinguished line of editors, he was by tem- 
perament far from fitted for the work, and he 
chafed under its routine, its practical details, 
and its petty exactions. The constant flood of 
manuscripts appalled him ; on one occasion he 
wrote jubilantly that he had cleared them all 
away, but the respite could not in the nature 
of things be lasting, and it was with a distinct 
sense of relief that he resigned the editorial 
desk to Mr. Fields. Under great difficulties 
he had accomplished much for the magazine,^ 
and given it that foremost place among our 
monthlies that it has ever since retained. 

The chapter which deals with " Lowell and 
the War for the Union " is one of the strongest 
and most interesting in the biography, but it 
covers familiar ground, being mainly concerned 
with Lowell's political essays, and the second 
series of " The Biglow Papers." During this 
period, the " North American Review," of 
which he had assumed the editorship, became 
the medium through which he chiefly addressed 
the public. It is interesting to note the develop- 
ment of his appreciation of the great President 
who bore the burden of the Civil War. Lowell 
had favored the nomination of Seward, and 
was much disappointed when Lincoln proved 
to be the successful candidate in the Conven- 
tion. He did not know the man, and hfr 
doubted. As the war went on, he expressed 
his impatience more than once at what seemed 
the temporizing policy and excess of caution 
displayed by Lincoln. But as the drama drew 
near its close, and the President was seen to be 
so magnificently justified by the event, Lowell's 
admiration for the man grew deeper and deeper, 
the heroic figure was at last seen in its true 
proportions, and Lowell more than made up 
for his early questionings in the apotheosis of 
his " Commemoration Ode." But it is curious 
to note that the sixth stanza, in which the won- 
derful characterization of Lincoln appears, was 
not recited at Harvard, and not even written 
at the time of the delivery of the " Ode,"^ 
although added almost immediately afterwards.

<' It is so completely imbedded in the structure of 
the ode that it is difficult to think of it as an after- 
thought. It is easy to perceive that while the glow of 
•composition and of recitation was still upon him Lowell 
suddenly conceived this splendid illustration and indeed 
climax of the utterance of the Ideal which is so im- 
pressive in the fifth stanza. So free, so spontaneous is 
this characterization of Lincoln, and so concrete in 
thought, that it has been most frequently read, we sus- 
pect, of any single portion of the ode, and it is so elo- 
<juent that one likes to fancy the whole force of the ode 
behind it, as if Lowell needed the fire he had fanned to 
white heat, for the very purpose of forging this last, 
firm, tempered bit of steel. Into these threescore lines 
Lowell has poured a conception of Lincoln which may 
justly be said to be to-day the accepted idea which 
Americans hold of their great President. It was the 
final expression of the judgment which had slowly been 
forming in Lowell's own mind, and when he summed 
him up in his last line, — 

'New birth of our new soil, the first American,' 
He was honestly throwing away all the doubts which 
bad from time to time beset him, and letting his ardent 
pursuit of the ideal, his profound faith in democracy as 
incarnate in his country, centre in this one man." 

We must pass over the period of combined 
literary and educational activity that followed 
upon the close of the war, and turn at once to 
JLowell's career in the diplomatic service of his 
country. He was offered the Austrian mission 
soon after Hayes took the presidential chair. 
He told Mr. Howells, who approached him on 
behalf of the President, that he must decline 
the offer, but remarked, at the close of the con- 
versation, " I should like to see a play of 
Calderon." The hint was sufficient, and soon 
thereafter he was officially invited to represent 
his country at Madrid. The social and diplo- 
matic success of his Spanish Mission were so 
marked that the appointment to the Court of 
St. James followed some three years later as a 
logical consequence. 

Lowell's life in England as American min- 
ister was useful to both his country and himself. 
The country benefitted by a strengthening of 
the bonds of friendship between the United 
States and England ; the man benefitted by a 
broadening of his outlook and a refinement of 
his ideals. As early as 1848, he had written 
that " nationality is only a less narrow form of 
provincialism, a sublimer sort of clownishness 
and ill manners." But it is difficult to deny 
that Lowell, when he went to England, took 
with him something of that provincialism of 
which he himself, in his dispassionate moments, 
recognized the narrowness. An English critic 
who became one of his warmest admirers, and 
of whose sympathy there can be no doubt, 
wrote of his appearance in England as follows : 
*' He came over here full of anti-English preju- 



dices. When he said, ' We are worth nothing 
except so far as we have disinfected ourselves 
of Anglicism,' he fully meant what he said. 
Englishmen who met him then were apt to find 
this disinfecting process rather a nuisance, but 
with the American new-comer, if he is of the 
right strain, you have only to grin and bear. 
In the atmosphere of his fathers he will soon 
begin to grow. . . . The truth is that Lowell, 
having been thrown into the best circles — 
best, I mean, as regards their wide knowledge 
of man and of men — discovered (as Emerson 
had done before him) that the voice of the 
mob of New York is, in its Anglophobic tem- 
per at least, as far off from being the voice of 
God as that of any people under the sun. He 
found that between an American of the true 
strain and an Englishman of the true strain 
there is a stronger attraction than exists be- 
tween men of any other strain, however good. 
He found that John Bull is not quite so offen- 
sively taurine as the American pressmen paint 
him — that he is not in the habit of greeting 
Jonathan with ' a certain condescension,' but 
on the contrary is in the habit of treating him 
as an absolute equal in most things, and as a 
superior in some." These remarks were made 
by Mr. Theodore Watts in a reminiscent article 
published in " The Athenaeum " just after 
Lowell's death. The simple truth is that Lowell 
had misunderstood English life and thought 
before he came to live among Englishmen, and 
when he did come to understand them, he was 
honest enough to say what he thought. Yet, 
as his biographer says, 

" Throughout his stay in England he showed a certain 
vigilance as the champion of American institutions, 
speech, and manners which gave him the air of combat- 
iveness. An Englishman who was often his host said: 
' I like Mr. Lowell. I like to have him here. I keep 
him as long as I can, and I am always in terror lest 
somebody shall say something about America that 
would provoke an explosion.' " 

One incident connected with Lowell's En- 
glish experiences may be mentioned. His 
popularity was so great that it brought him, in 
1883, the election as Lord Rector of the Uni- 
versity of St. Andrews. Some indiscreet per- 
son having objected to the nomination because 
Lowell was an alien, the matter came up for 
lively discussion both in and out of print. 
" Punch," as usual, said the final word upon 
the subject of controversy, when it published 
the following verses : 

"An alien? Goto! If fresh, genial wit 
In sound Saxon speech be not genuine grit, 
If the wisdom and mirth he has put into verse for os

'T is crass party spirit, Boeotian, dense,

It turned out, however, that Lowell was ineli- 
gible for the appointment, not because he was 
an alien, but by reason of his " extra-territori- 
ality " as the American minister. 

We will close this review of a deeply-inter- 
esting work with some extracts which illustrate 
Lowell's attitude towards the larger questions 
of politics. In the strict sense, his political 
activity was confined to his services as a mem- 
ber of the Republican Convention of 1876, and 
as a Presidential Elector the following year. 
He went to the Convention as an adherent of 
Bristow and an opponent of Blaine. Writing 
of his participation in the gathering, he said : 

" I believed that a Kentucky candidate might at least 
give the starting-point for a party at the South whose 
line of division should be other than sectional, and by 
which the natural sympathy between reasonable and 
honest men at the North and the South should have a 
fair chance to reassert itself. We failed, but at least 
succeeded in preventing the nomination of a man whose 
success in the Convention (he would have been beaten 
disastrously at the polls) would have been a lesson to 
American youth that selfish partisanship is a set-off for 
vulgarity of character and obtnseness of moral sense. 
I am proud to say that it was New England that de- 
feated the New England candidate." 

Eleven years later, he visited Chicago, for the 
purpose of addressing the Union League Club 
on Washington's birthday, and intending to 
speak upon " American Politics." The result- 
ing episode is thus described by Mr. Scudder : 
" The house was completely filled and Lowell was 
given a hearty welcome. The audience, however, was 
greatly taken aback at the first words of the speaker, 
for he said when he came forward that he had changed 
bis subject and would speak, not on < American Politics,' 
but upon the principles of literary critism as illustrated 
by Shakespeare's ' Richard III.' . . . He went on to say 
that in announcing politics as the subject of his address 
he had not fully realized the conditions under which it 
was to be delivered ; that he was accustomed to speak 
frankly, but that he found himself the guest and, in a 
manner, the representative of the Club. What he had 
to say would plainly give offence to his hosts, and he 
was thus compelled on the score of courtesy to change 
his subject. The situation was one which might have 
led those present to detect some irony in Lowell's po- 
liteness. The Union League Club was a Republican 
organization under the control of the Blaine wing of the 
party. It had succeeded in getting rid of those Repub- 
licans who had been hostile to Blaine, amongst whom 
was the gentleman who was Lowell's host. But Lowell 
had made no concealment of the position he occupied. 
He made it clear enough at this time, a couple of days 
later when he was a guest of the Harvard Club of Chi- 



cago. ' I stood outside of party,' he then said, * for 
nearly twenty-five years, and I was perfectly happy, I 
assure you. . . . Party organization, no doubt, is a very 
convenient thing, but a great many people, and I feel 
very strongly with them, feel that when loyalty to party 
means worse disloyalty to conscience, it is then asking^ 
more than any good man or any good citizen ought ti> 
concede.' " 

The treatment accorded to Lowell upon this 
occasion by the press and a large section of the 
public was of such a nature that most Chicago- 
ans of intelligence and refinement blush for 
their city whenever they recall the* thing to 
mind. Both in public print and private conver- 
sation Lowell was roundly abused by those who 
should have been warmest in his defense. For 
an act prompted only by a fine sense of honor 
and exceptional delicacy of feeling he was dealt 
with as if he had been guilty of an insult to the 
public and a gross betrayal of faith. The whole 
affair was extremely discreditable to the city 
whose guest was thus treated, aud we are glad 
that Mr. Scudder has at least outlined the situ- 
ation with exact truthfulness. He might pro- 
perly have gone still further, and made some 
caustic allusion to the public exhibition of bad 
manners which this episode occasioned, for in 
this, as in all other matters, it may safely be said 
of Lowell, as Tennyson said of Wellington, 
" Whatever record leaps to light 
He never shall be shamed."

could make better use of the knowledge labori- 
ously acquired of Chinese classics and customs 
than is here disclosed. The book summarizes

a student who has so far divested himself of 
western prejudices as to see beneath the sur- 
face to the very heart of a majestic and endur- 
ing civilization. 

The sequel and complement of a former book 
from the same hand, " A Cycle of Cathay," 
it differentiates itself from that standard work, 
which was concerned with the active life of the 
Chinese, by dealing almost exclusively with 
their intellectual life. It is divided into five 
parts, dealing respectively with the various 
intellectual departments of the Empire, its lit- 
erature, its religion and philosophy, its educa- 
tional methods, and a few studies in Chinese 
history, — the latter including a consideration 
of " sources," of the Tartars in ancient China, 
of international law as the Chinese know it, 
and of their diplomacy, past and present. 

Dr. Martin has no doubt that the invention 
of gunpowder and the discovery of the magnet 
as a guide to orientation rest with the ancient 
Chinese, and cites certain classical works in 
proof of the antiquity of the knowledge. He 
believes, too, that the European invention of 
movable types for printing may be traced, in 
modified form, to this ancient race. The manu- 
facture of porcelain and silk is undoubtedly 
Chinese, and they not only invented paper 
about the beginning of the Christian era, bat 
made wood pulp into paper centuries ago. On 
the side of science, it is to be said that alchemy, 
the parent of modern chemistry, is certainly 
Chinese in its origin ; while astronomy has a 
history going back forty-one centuries in the 
Middle Kingdom. Decimal arithmetic is also 
theirs, with a possible beginning as early as 
2600 B. C, and a text-book setting forth its 
principles which is authentically dated 1125 
B. C. Dr. Martin shows, moreover, that the 
modern concept of ether was already a sub- 
ject of Chinese speculation in the eleventh 
century before Christ, just as suggestions of 
both the Baconian and Cartesian philosophy 
may be found in age-old discourses accepted 
among Chinese scholars. With interesting 
details of this sort the book abounds. 

Passing over the suggestions of the influence 
of the Christian religion upon the Chinese 
mind, in which the author holds a brief for 
Protestant orthodoxy, the fascinating chapter 
on Chinese education will be found worthy of 
careful study. " In no country," we are told, 
" is the office of teacher more revered. Not 
only is the living instructor saluted with forms 
of profoundest respect, but the name of teacher, 
taken in the abstract, is an object of almost 



idolatrous homage." Yet it becomes readily 
apparent that there are grave defects in the 
existing system, in which the teacher holds his 
pupil's esteem by the exercise of what Dr. 
Martin calls " the argument a jposteriori^^ and 
keeps his little students at work for five full 
years memorizing the Chinese classics, which 
are to-day couched in a language the meaning 
of which is "absolutely unknown to them. At 
the end of that time the period of exegesis sets 
in, and the minds so carefully exercised by 
long and meaningless learning by heart are 
slowly brought to fructification by the transla- 
tion into the vernacular of all the innumerable 
syllables with which they are stored. That the 
Chinese generally are not as well educated as 
Europeans suppose, is one of many astonishing 
statements in the book which are made to bear 
their own conviction with them. If the ability 
to read and write means what it does with us^ 
hardly one Chinaman in a thousand, and not 
one Chinawoman in ten thousand, possesses 
these accomplishments. All can read the syl- 
lables as they find them in a book, but few 
have any knowledge of what they mean ; all 
can write with the copy before them, but very 
few can indite an original composition ; all can 
cipher sufficiently for their business needs, 
but there their mathematical knowledge stops 
abruptly. 

Yet China is, emphatically, the land of the 
scholar. The civil service is in the possession 
of members of the Republic of Letters to an 
extent unknown elsewhere, and for that system 
Dr. Martin professes the utmost respect. In- 
deed, he would have Christendom take it over 
in all its essentials. 

"The bare suggestion may p»erhap3 provoke a smile; 
but are not the long duration of the Chinese govem- 
ment, and the vast population to which it has served to 
secure a fair measure of prosperity, phenomena that 
challenge admiration? Why should it be considered 
derogatory to our civilization to copy an institution 
which is confessedly the masterpiece in that skillful 
mechanism — the balance-wheel that regulates the 
working of that wonderful machinery? . . . More con- 
genial to the spirit of our free government, it might be 
expected to yield better fruits in this country than in 
China. In British India it works admirably [and in 
Egypt and the Malayan States even more admirably]. 
In Great Britain, too, the diplomatic and consular ser- 
vices have been placed on a competitive basis; and 
something of the same kind must be done for our for- 
eign service if we wish our influence abroad to be at all 
commensurate with our greatness and prosperity at 
home. When will our government learn that a good 
consul is worth more than a man-of-war, and that an 
able minister is of more value than a whole fleet of 
iron-clads? " 

Dr. Martin commends the Chinese for many

McCl.el,l,an as a Great Commander.* 



The difficulties under which a democracy 
conducts war was epitomized in the career of 
General George B. McClellan, whose Life by 
General Peter S. Michie, the latest addition to 
Appletons' " Great Commanders " series, at- 
tains its greatest value, perhaps, not from what 
soldiers may learn from its pages as to the 
proper conduct of campaigns and battles, but 
from the warnings which McClellan's career 
gives to presidents, cabinets, bureau officers, 
and congresses, concerning what civilians in 
positions of authority and influence should not 
do. From the settlement of the colonies to the 
present time, we have never been long without 
war ; and we have so persistently repeated, 
throughout our colonial and national existence 
— in the war of the Revolution, in the war of 
1812, in the Civil War, and in the recent war 
with Spain — the error of civilian interference 
in the conduct of military affairs, that the rec- 
ord as it stands must be attributed less to igno- 
rance of our own history, faulty logic, and hasty 
mistakes of judgment, than to the impatience of 
our people, our national traits of character, and 
our political and social institutions, which are 
little adapted to the making of war. 

McClellan's career is enshrouded in such 
historical confusion that the sincere biographer, 
who seeks to account for it by a scientific con- 
sideration of all the elements of the case, 
attempts a most formidable undertaking ; and 
perhaps no man who lived during the Civil 
War period, who has associated with the par- 
ticipants in the struggle, whose judgment has 
been influenced by the writings of the survivors 
of the conflict and disturbed by the conflicting 
reputations of the " great captains with their 
guns," can be expected to grapple with the

task in a way thoroughly to satisfy logical 
readers of the correctness of the explanatory 
theory at which he may arrive. From the 
very number of the contentions in regard to 
McClellan's plans and achievements, it is 
necessary that his case should be considered 
freshly, with all the industry required to weigh 
the evidence, and by a mind gifted and trained 
in the analytical power of determining which 
is the vital piece of evidence in the mass of 
testimony, and what is the weight of the evi- 
dence. Much of the confusion and many of the 
conflicting claims in connection with the mili- 
tary careers of the Civil War are to be directly 
traced to a want of the analytical power often 
combined with that defective reasoning which 
Lord Kelvin has said has lost more vessels 
than have been sunk by faulty seamanship. 

To the doubts and contentions hovering over 
all McClellan's career, the late General Michie 
endeavored to apply a simple and readily 
understood theory. To McClellan, this biog- 
raphy attributes every personal virtue, — high- 
mindedness, a noble and generous character, 
lofty patriotism, industry, mastery over details, 
great capacity for organization, fondness for 
the study of strategy. The book is also fair 
to McClellan in its enumeration of the personal 
and political difficulties with which the army 
commander had to contend. .But it also taxes 
him with persistent exaggeration of the enemy's 
strength, with lack of aggressiveness, with 
timidity, and tactical incapacity. Let us con- 
sider some of McClellan's difficulties. 

Called to the command of McDowell's de- 
feated army and the troops at Washington 
immediately after the battle of Bull Run, and 
assigned to the task of making an army out of 
a mob, McClellan on the one hand was hindered 
by the presence of General Scott, who was still 
at the head of the regular army, and on the 
other hand by the ignorance of his staff and 
line officers. The amount of personal work 
thrown upon him in the organization of the 
Army of the Potomac, because of the absence 
of competent subordinate officers, was so pro- 
digious that, strong as he was, he broke down 
physically under the burden. November 1, 
1861, Scott was retired ; and McClellan, be- 
coming General-in-Chief, had to consider larger 
plans than those which related merely to the 
Army of the Potomac. The whole theatre of 
the war was under his direction. Very notable 
at this time was his desire to have General 
Buell march to the relief of the loyal people of 
Eastern Tennessee.

Early in the winter, McClellan was stricken 
with typhoid fever. Stanton succeeded Cam- 
eron as Secretary of War, and the attitude of 
the department changed from one of cordial 
support to one of hostility to the army com- 
mander. The Congressional Committee on the 
Conduct of the War, of which Wade and 
Chandler were the leading spirits, — a com- 
mittee of whose star-chamber proceedings, of 
whose indictments, one-sided trials and convic- 
tions of prominent officers, it is difficult to 
condemn in terms of moderation, — was ag- 
gressively hostile to McClellan. The pressure 
of the politicians was for an immediate advance 
of the army, fit or unfit ; and during the period 
of McClellan's illness in the early winter, the 
President, by consulting with several of Mc- 
Clellan's subordinates in the presence of Cab- 
inet officers, tried to formulate by committee a 
plan of campaign at a season of the year which 
would have doomed any overland campaign to 
failure. On January 27, 1862, Mr. Lincoln 
ordered that a general movement of the Union 
forces be made on February 22 ; and for the 
same day the President ordered a movement 
of the Army of the Potomac upon the Orange 
and Alexandria railroad. Finally, Mr. Lincoln 
was persuaded to abandon his plan of campaign 
for McClellan's Peninsula plan. It may be 
said at this time that, coming to Washington 
in midsummer, McClellan had done everything 
that could be reasonably expected of him in 
the few months before the season of bad roads 
set in, and that thereafter nothing could be 
undertaken with any chance of success until 
the roads had again become passable. Had 
McClellan marched out to the Occoquan, in 
the fall of 1861, we may safely infer from the 
career of the Confederate General Joseph E. 
Johnston — which, from the beginning of his 
service along the Potomac in Virginia, on the 
Peninsula, in the Vicksburg campaign, and 
before Sherman, was uniformly and throughout 
one of retrogression — that the Confederates 
would simply have fallen back, and little would 
have been gained except the marching experi- 
ence. It is General Michie's view, however, 
that McClellan should have made the movement. 

By the spring of 1862, — that is, before 
there could be any reasonable hope of a suc- 
cessful general movement of McClellan's army, 
— the army commander's standing with the 
President had been so undermined that it was 
deemed necessary by McClellan, in order to 
win the President's consent to a movement by 
way of the Chesapeake Bay to Urbana on the 



Rappahannock River, that the plan should be 
submitted to the approval of his subordinate 
generals. The nature of the proposition suffi- 
ciently indicates the conditions which made it 
necessary, conditions under which no general 
could hope to conduct campaigns to a successful 
issue. On March 8, the President selected for 
him four corps commanders, — McDowell, Sum- 
ner, Heintzelman, and Keyes. Of the degree 
of capacity indicated and reputation made by 
these officers, it is sufficient to say that theirs 
are not among the great names of the war. 
Sumner and Heintzelman were already well 
advanced in years ; Keyes was soon retired : 
and McDowell, like McClellan, had already 
suffered from being expected to do with raw 
volunteers that which only an organized and 
disciplined army could accomplish. The Presi- 
dent also ordered that McClellan's movement 
should not be made without leaving in front of 
Washington a sufficient force for its protection, 
and that, this being done and the Potomac 
cleared of the foe, the movement should begin 
on March 18 ; and on March 11, the President 
relieved McClellan of all military departments 
outside of the Department of the Potomac, an 
act not calculated to increase the degree of 
confidence still felt in the General. 

It seems now unfortunate that McClellan 
abandoned his Urbana plan for the movement 
up the Peninsula between the York and James 
Rivers, from Fort Monroe as a base. The 
movement from Urbana would certainly have 
resulted in the capture or quick retirement of 
Magruder's forces on the Peninsula below, and 
would probably have compelled the retirement 
of Johnston from the immediate vicinity of 
Washington. But as Johnston retired at this 
time, of his own volition, to the line of the 
Rappahannock, we have to consider chiefly the 
superiority of a movement threatening Ma- 
gruder's rear, in contrast with the one actually 
made upon his front. What McClellan's mo- 
tives were for the change, are not clear. He 
himself said that the Administration forced the 
change upon him. The present biographer 
does not accept this view, but he does not clear 
up the matter altogether. The confusion con- 
tinued, not through McClellan's fault, when 
the General desired to make a flank movement 
up the York River for the purpose of turning 
the Confederate position at Yorktown and ar- 
riving quickly at West Point on the Richmond 
and York River Railroad, within thirty miles 
of Richmond. No adequate cooperation of the 
navy was arranged for or apparently contem-

plated by the authorities ; and McClellan was 
left to make the best of the direct movement 
upon Magruder's front. 

Once under way, McClellan was furnished 
with a map prepared by General Wool's topo- 
graphical engineer, which failed entirely to 
show that the Warwick River ran across the 
Peninsula. Behind this stream McClellan 
found the Confederates entrenched. His own 
generals and his staff proved unequal to their 
positions. General Michie says that at York- 
town McClellan encountered the most critical 
moment in his career, — implying that he 
should have attacked promptly, instead of set- 
tling down to a siege. Undoubtedly he should 
have attacked. McClellan had much to learn 
about the practical handling of an army in 
front of a foe. He had had so far little op- 
portunity to learn. But there is little more 
reason for considering Yorktown a critical 
moment inMcClellan's career than for thinking 
Shiloh a critical moment in the careers of 
Grant and Sherman. 

In spite of Yorktown, McClellan, with ex- 
perience, with better corps commanders such 
as Meade picked out later for the same army, 
and with a staff such as Meade was enabled 
later to develope, might have run the glorious 
career of a successful general. That he could 
have rushed into Richmond with the army as 
it was in the spring of 1862, is not by any 
means made clear, even if we ignore the op- 
position of hurrying Confederate reinforce- 
ments. That McClellan was steadily improv- 
ing as a commanding general is shown by his 
subsequent Antietam campaign, which, in spite 
of the serious blunder of a weak corps com- 
mander of whom McClellan said truly that he 
was only fitted to command a regiment, was 
highly successful. 

The important question of McClellan's posi- 
tion astride the Chickahominy, and the other 
question whether the retirement to the James 
River was voluntary, or was forced upon him 
by Lee in part and in part was the result of 
his own timidity, are discussed with every dis- 
position on the part of the biographer to be 
fair to the army commander ; but it is difficult 
to avoid the impression that General Michie's 
appreciation of the tactical blunders of Mc- 
Clellan's army — blunders due largely to the 
lack of practical experience on the part of 
McClellan and his corps commanders, — and 
a certain impatience with the resulting faulty 
manoeuvring in the face of the foe, prevented 
the biographer from giving due value to the 



soundness of McClellan's strategical plans. 
At the same period, and in the same campaign, 
tactical mistakes were made abundantly in 
Lee's army by Stonewall Jackson and other 
Confederate generals. In the Antietam cam- 
paign, Lee's strategical movements were of the 
most dangerous character. In the Gettysburg 
campaign, his tactics were faulty in the ex- 
treme ; and, indeed, it was not until the last 
year of the war that Lee's tactics developed to 
the point where they would bear the severest 
scrutiny. McClellan had no such opportunity 
to learn the art of war. 

With every disposition to be just toward the 
subject of his biography. General Michie early 
in his book, in his account of the Rich Moun- 
tain affair in West Virginia, indicates the 
attitude of disapproval which he steadily main- 
tains toward all McClellan's movements in the 
field. Now McClellan's movement upon Rich 
Mountain was as well planned as Stonewall 
Jackson's flank march upon Hooker at Chan- 
cellorsville ; although, of course, the battle at 
Rich Mountain was on much the smaller scale. 
But General Michie would take away much 
credit from McClellan, because it was Rose- 
crans who, by McClellan's orders, making the 
flanking movement on the right, discovered the 
theretofore unknown woods-road which led him 
to the Confederate flank unobserved. Inas- 
much as in the older parts of our country, 
wherever extensive woods exist, woods-roads 
are also to be found, McClellan in strict equity 
cannot be deprived of the credit of his victory 
because his subordinate, acting under McClel- 
lan's orders and moving in the way that 
McClellan had directed him to go, was so con- 
spicuous an element in the affair. 

The presumption in favor of the idea that 
McClellan's right was extended on the north 
bank of the Chickahominy for the purpose of 
connecting with McDowell's force when the 
latter should move down from the Rappahan- 
nock, is so strong that, even if we did not have 
the emphatic statements of McClellan himself 
and his confidants in support of it, the minor 
evidence to the opposite effect does not appear 
sufficient to overthrow it. The unfortunate 
position of the army was due to two counter- 
acting influences at work, — one being McClel- 
lan's desire to move to the James, and the 
other the desire of the civil authorities for a 
more or less direct covering of Washington. 
Lee's attack on McClellan's right set the Union 
commander free to go where he wanted to go.

Mechanicsville was made on Jane 26. But on 
the 18th McClellan had ordered supplies sent 
up the James. The movement to the James was 
already under way when Lee attacked at 
Mechanicsville, a Union victory which certainly 
gave McClellan no cause to hurry. 

Nor does General Michie appear to give full 
value to the strategical importance of the battle 
of South Mountain, the turning-point in the 
Antietam campaign. The forcing of Turner's 
Pass was most skilfully and successfully done, 
and caused Lee to prepare for and consider an 
immediate retirement to Virginia. Consider- 
ing the circumstances, the forcing of the 
mountain pass was promptly done. Lee's 
"lost orders," which came into McClellan 's 
possession, placed at the pass a Confederate 
force sufficient to hold it against a host. As 
a matter of fact, a large part of this force had 
gone on toward Hagerstown ; but of this, 
McClellan could have no knowledge. Even 
as it was, the Confederate force left at the pass 
was sufficient to prevent Cox from gaining the 
crest to the south of the pass, and Gibbon from 
making any headway in front of the pass. 
Meade's successful gaining of the crest by 
assault on the right compelled Lee to abandon 
the position. At Fairfield Pass, in July, 1863, 
a small Confederate rear-guard was sufficient 
to make so capable a corps commander as Sedg- 
wick, with so large a force as the Sixth Corps, 
think that the pass could only be forced after 
long delay ; and Sedgwick's decision has never 
been questioned. In the ensuing battle of 
Antietam — a wasteful engagement on Lee's 
part, and one fought after he had seen that his 
campaign of invasion had come to grief — 
McClellan only failed of a decisive tactical 
success because of the well-meaning Burnside's 
shortcomings as a corps commander. But even 
then, all the substantial results were with 
McClellan. Lee's scheme of invading Pennsyl- 
vania had been abandoned before. From being 
the aggressor, he had from South Mountain on- 
ward been upon the defensive ; and he now aban- 
doned the battle-field and returned to Virginia. 

The obvious tactical errors in McClellan's 
battles — some of these errors due to untrained 
subordinates and inexperience in actual war- 
fare — should not prevent a due appreciation 
of his comprehension of larger strategical prob- 
lems. It looks now as if the greatest error in 
all his campaigns was committed by the civil 
authorities in bringing his army away from the 
James. General Lee never forgot what Mc- 
Clellan's threat pointed out to him, and before 



Grant's 1864 campaign was under way wrote 
to President Davis of the possibility that the 
Union forces might cut the Weldon Railroad 
and compel the evacuation of Petersburg and 
the downfall of Richmond. 

General Michie suggests that longer experi- 
ence might have eliminated McClellan's faults 
as a tactician, — a suggestion which will also 
be found in my earlier " Life of General 
Meade " in the same series. McClellan's claim 
to be remembered, according to his present 
biographer, will rest upon his organization of 
the Army of the Potomac, — a stupendous 
work, performed under many difficulties. Im- 
portant as McClellan's work was, the organi- 
zation of the Army of the Potomac did not 
reach a state approaching perfection until the 
spring of 1864, by which time the inadequate 
staff and corps commanders had been gotten 
rid of, and Meade's orders were elaborated by 
so able a chief of staff as Humphreys, and 
executed by such competent corps commanders 
as Hancock, Sedgwick, and Warren. But to 
the foundation of McClellan's claim to the grati- 
tude of his country should be added his suc- 
cessful Antietam campaign, — the five most 
vital battles of the war (apart from sieges like 
the Siege of Vicksburg), being Gettysburg, 
South Mountain and Antietam (considered 
together), Nashville, Champion Hill (which 
decided that Pemberton should be shut up in 
Vicksburg), and Chattanooga. This list throws 
the names of Meade, McClellan, Thomas, and 
Grant, among Civil War generals, into promi- 
nence for having rendered the most conspicuous 
service to the Union in the hour of most vital 
need. Overshadowed by Gettysburg, — as it 
always will be, and justly, — still, the import- 
ance of the Antietam campaign will some day 
be better appreciated than it is now.

ating it has been such as to give these four 
volumes a secure place among the books of 
permanent value to all who are interested in 
American history. The objects sought by the 
editor were two : 

"First, to put within convenient reach of schools, 
libraries, and scholars authoritatiye texts of rare or 
quaint writings in American history contemporary with 
the events which they describe, and in the second place, 
to give, in a succession of scenes, a notion of the move- 
ment and connection of the history of America, so that 
from this work by itself may be had an impression of 
the forces which have shaped our history and the prob- 
lems upon which they have worked." 

The success of such an undertaking de- 
manded that the reader should feel absolutely 
sure of the genuineness of the extracts given, 
and, furthermore, that he should have the 
utmost confidence in the discriminating judg- 
ment of the editor. As to the latter point 
there is probably little doubt, considering Pro- 
fessor Hart's place among students of American 
history ; and for the former strict rules were 
followed : 

" First of all, pains have been taken to use the first 
authoritative edition of each work in English; and a 
faithful translation of pieces in foreign languages. 
Next, the copy is meant to be exact. . . . Words not 
easily recognized are, however, repeated in modern 
dress in brackets. Next, the quotations are meant to 
be exact, all omissions being indicated, and the place 
where the extract was found being noted at the end." 

The result of the study is found in the 
twenty-five hundred pages of gathered glean- 
ings from diaries, letters, reports, discussions, 
reminiscences, addresses, newspapers, maga- 
zines, and other sources of materials, some 
manuscripts being available for the more recent 
period. Ofiicial documents find no place, these 
having been collated by Preston, Macdonald, 
and others, but the expression of opinion 
throughout the years is clearly shown by the 
wide range of selection, the philosophy of 
" Mr. Dooley " and the words of popular songs 
being presented along with the sounding sen- 
tences of some great oration or the studied 
argument upon some great theme of present 
moment. And so the volumes may be consid- 
ered not alone a compendium of history, but 
also a study in American literature, showing 
in a wonderfully interesting way the changes 
and improvement in American writing, spell- 
ing, and thinking during nearly three hundred 
years. 

The latest volume, finishing the series, was 
no doubt the most difficult in preparation, being 
nearest to the life activity of many yet living, 
and the selection of materials to illustrate the 



history of the last twenty years must have been 
a peculiarly trying task. Upon some questions 
public opinion is not yet settled, and twenty 
years hence a selection made in 1901 may be 
rejected as entirely unrepresentative, whereas 
the judgment of history probably has been 
finally passed upon the great topics of the 
periods illustrated by the first, second, and 
third volumes. 

An idea of the skill and resources of the 
editor may be gained by a study of Part IX., 
which is devoted to recent American problems. 
The five chapters discuss the Spanish War, 
Questions of Colonization, Foreign Problems, 
Problems of Government, and Social Problems ; 
and the names of writers include Admiral 
Dewey, Captain Mahan, Ex-Secretary Day, 
Governor Leonard Wood, President McKinley, 
Ex-Secretary Richard Olney, President Roose- 
velt, Ex-Secretary Carl Schurz, Mr. Jacob A. 
Riis, Mr. Henry W. Grady, President Eliot, 
and Mr. Booker T. Washington. Not every- 
one may agree with Professor Hart regarding 
the final value of the selections printed, but 
the names just specified will convince any critic 
that an honest effort has been made to choose 
representative literature of the present day. 

The obligation due the editor for the series 
is great, and as the volumes become more and 
more familiar in private study and public 
library, the feeling of appreciation will steadily 
increase. Francis W. Shepardson. 



Memoirs of ax American Actress.* 



A theatrical memoir of more than ordinary 
interest, owing to the eventful and highly in- 
teresting career of its author, is " Life on the 
Stage," which sets forth the personal experi- 
ences and recollections of Miss Clara Morris. 
Her career was most eventful, in the ordinary 
acceptation of the term ; it was full of many 
and diverse interests, and the real measure of 
her ultimate success can only be estimated 
when all these interests are taken into account. 

Miss Morris was born at Toronto on a cer- 
tain 17th of March in the early fifties ; but 
six months completed her period of existence in 
the Dominion. Her early life in the States was 
not altogether free from hardship and pov- 
erty, and there is a pathetic strain in her 
narrative as she tells of the early struggles —

the sad neglect of a faithless father and the 
untiring toil of a loving mother. When thirteen 
years of age she went on the stage as a ballet- 
girl, taking part in the marches and dances 
of a play called "The Seven Sisters," for which 
service she received the munificent sum of 
three dollars a week. Step by step she ad- 
vanced in her profession, and as the years 
crept by she became possessed of a broader 
and more comprehensive view of the drama ; 
standing humbly at the knee of Shakespeare, 
she began to learn something of another world 
— fairy-like in fascination, marvellous in re- 
ality. It is to be remembered that at about 
this time Forrest, crowned and wrapped in 
royal robes, was yet tottering on his throne ; 
Charlotte Cushman was the Tragic Queen of 
the stage ; James Murdoch, highly esteemed, 
was still acting ; Joseph Jefferson, E. L. Daven- 
port, Charles Culdock, J. K. Hackett, Maggie 
Mitchell, and Matilda Heron were numbered 
among the popular favorites ; and Edwin Booth, 
the greatest light of all, was rising in golden 
glory in the East. 

In comparing the actor of forty years ago 
with the actor of to-day, Miss Morris makes a 
statement which will elicit protest from many 
quarters. 

"Looking back to the actors of '65, I can't help 
noticing the difference between their attitude of mind 
toward their profession and that of the actor of to-daj. 
Salaries were much smaller then, work was harder, but 
life was simpler. The actor had no social standing; he 
was no longer looked down upon, but he was an un- 
known quantity; he was, in short, an actor pure and 
simple. He had enthusiasm for his profession — he 
lived to act, not merely living by acting. He had more 
superstition than religion and no politics at all ; but he 
was patriotic and shouldered his gun and marched away 
in the ranks as cheerfully as any other citizen soldier. 
But above all and beyond all else, the men and women 
respected their chosen profession. Their constant as- 
sociation of mind with Shakespeare seemed to have 
given them a certain dignity of bearing as well as of 
speech. To-day our actors have in many cases won 
some social recognition, and they must therefore give 
a portion of their time to social duties. They are club- 
men, and another portion of their time goes in club 
lounging. They draw large salaries and too frequently 
they have to act in long running plays, that are made 
up of smartish wit and cheapest cynicism — mere froth 
and frivolity, — while the effective smashing of the 
Seventh Commandment has been for so long a time the 
principal motif of both drama and farce that one cannot 
wonder much at the general tone of flippancy prevail- 
ing among theatrical people of to-day. . . . They are 
sober, they are honest, they are generous, but they 
seem to have grown utterly flippant, and I can't help 
wondering if this alteration can have come about through 
the change in their mental pabulum. At all events, as 
I watched and listened in the old days, it seemed to 
me that they were never weary of discussing readings, 



expressions, emphasis, and action. One would remark, 
say at a rehearsal of « Hamlet,' that Macready gave a 
certain line in this manner, and another would in- 
stantly express a preference for a Forrest — or a 
Davenport — reading, and then the argument would be 
oo, and only a call to the stage would end the weighing 
of words, the placing of commas, etc." 

It was in her third season that Miss Morris's 
position became an anomalous one ; it showed 
that in the girl there dwelt a latent spark of 
genius waiting to be fanned into a flame. She 
studied in one afternoon, letter perfect, the 
part of JS^ing Charles in " Faint Heart Never 
Won Fair Lady," and played it, in borrowed 
clothes, without any rehearsal whatever. This 
was followed by a greater success when she ap- 
peared in an adaptation of " La Maison Rouge " 
in support of that sterling actress. Miss Sallie 
St. Clair — wife of Charles Barras, the wealthy 
and eccentric author of the " Black Crook." 

" All girls have their gods. Some girls 
change theirs often. My gods were few. 
Sometimes I cast one down, but I never 
changed them ; and on the highest, whitest 
pedestal of all, grave and gentle, stood the 
god of my professional idolatry — Edwin 
Booth." And when the great actor played 
Hamlet in Mr. John A. Ellsler's company, the 
author of these interesting memoirs received 
the greatest surprise of her girlhood days, 
when, in looking over the proposed cast, she 
saw the entry : " Queen Gertrude — Miss 
Morris." But, notwithstanding that he looked 
more like her father than she like Hamlet's 
mother, she added another successful role to 
her fast-increasing repertory. 

<< It would seem like a presumption for me to try to 
add one little leaf to the tight-woven laurel crown he 
wore. Everyone knows the agony of his * Fool's Re- 
venge,' the damnable malice of his lago, the beauty 
and fire of Antonio, and the pure perfection of his 
Hamlet, — but how many knew the slow, cruel martyr- 
dom of his private life! which he bore with such mute 
patience that in my heart there is an altar raised to 
the memory of that Saint Edwin of many sorrows, who 
was known and envied by the world at large, as the 
great actor, Edwin Booth." 

After a short engagement in Cincinnati as 
leading lady. Miss Morris signed a contract 
with Augustin Daly, and gained the proud dis- 
tinction of being the first Western actress 
accepted by a New York audience. She was 
likewise the first actress who attempted with 
any degree of success the modern French 
emotional drama : her success in the role of 
Alixe is one of the memorable incidents of 
New York theatrical history. She was, how- 
ever, to our mind, much better fitted for parts

requiring stormy and passionate acting than 
for pathetic scenes. 

It is impossible to trace minutely Miss Mor- 
ris's career under the managerial guidance of 
Daly and Palmer. Needless to add, her wide 
acquaintance with theatrical celebrities, her 
ability to depict their habits, talk, manners, 
disposition, and appearance, with the exactness 
of reality, combine to render her book fasci- 
nating and instructive. Her style is graphic, 
fluent, and luminous ; she has an exquisite 
appreciation of wit and wisdom ; and her ven- 
eration for contemporary actors and actresses, 
combined as it is with the most uncommon 
perspicacity, is an additional qualification. 
Her volume does not belong to that class of 
theatrical memoirs which know no distinction 
— her life was not devoid of striking events 
and her career was one of triumph ; thus there 
was full scope for narrative, criticism, and 
personal reminiscence, which forms a book of 
human, tender, and personal interest.

African war might be listed under 
the general title of " The Price We Are Paying." 
" What We Are Getting " will perhaps better serve 
as a designation for Mr. W. Bleloch's " The New 
South Africa : Its Value and Development " 
(Doubleday). It is a general survey of the natural 
wealth of the Transvaal Republic and Orange Free 
State, as seen by a man of wide acquaintance with 
those two countries, coupled with an inquiry into 
the social conditions of the Burghers, the Uitland- 
ers, and the Kaffirs, as they are likely to exist at 
the anticipated conclusion of hostilities. Mr. 
Bleloch, it is not necessary to insist, is an enthusi- 
astic British partisan, and a believer in the leader- 
ship of Messrs. Cecil Rhodes and Joseph Chamber- 
lain. He finds it necessary, therefore, to omit all 
reference to the liberal movement among the 
Burghers of the Transvaal which came within a few 
hundred votes of electing the late General Joubert 
over President Krueger in 1893, and was increasing 
in strength daily until the Jameson outrage put an 
absolute end to internal reforms and left Mr. 
Krueger the practically unanimous choice of the 
Republic in 1898. Mr. Bleloch is also a voluntary 
witness to the conspiracy against the British in 
general, which is so positively denied by Messrs. 
Brice, Gooch, and others. It may be added that 
he is an optimist of no mean order, as may be seen 
from such statements as " The successful result of 
the War . . . has fully justified the cost," which 



he estimates at less than £150,000,000 ; " England 
has entrenched her position among the nations by 
the War "; and " If the whole cost of the War had 
to be borne by the British people, they would have 
gained by having kept intact that force in the 
world which is theirs, and which it ought to be 
their steadfast and proudest aim to maintain." It 
is perhaps idle to censure historical faults in a book 
which is avowedly " an unofficial prospectus of the 
work which lies before the British administration 
in the new Colonies," for there can be no doubt of 
the value which its contents afford to those who are 
seeking wealth in South Africa, assuming that 
Great Britain finally developes a policy which will 
make such a quest possible. The gold deposits 
occupy six chapters ; the coal fields another ; dia- 
monds and other minerals, dynamite and land, each 
one more ; immigration, the Uitlanders, the Boers, 
and the black natives, each one ; while separate 
sections of the narrative are given up to "Industry 
and Commerce," "The Railways," "Summary of 
Resources and Crown Assets," " The Present and 
Future Administration," "The Fiscal Policy — 
Capacity to Pay Part of the War Debt," and a 
separate consideration of the Orange Free State 
under its new title of the " Orange River Colony." 
The work concludes with an extended series of ap- 
pendices, made up for the most part of the statistics 
necessary to support the contentions of the several 
chapters ; and there is an index. 

In an illustrated volume of five hun- 
dred pages, Dr. Bernard Hollander 
expounds "The Mental Functions 
of the Brain" (Putnams), with the purpose of 
showing that the results of modern research all 
tend to reinstate the conclusions of the early phre- 
nologists. This " first work of the subject since 
the dawn of modern scientific research " is indeed 
a curious conglomerate of latter-day knowledge, of 
distorted interpretations of clinical evidence, of far- 
fetched and one-sided presentations of questionable 
observations, and of a profound lack of appreciation 
of modern logic as a scientific implement. It is 
true enough, and is well pointed out by the author, 
that the merits of Gall as an anatomist and physi- 
ologist of his day are considerable, that many of 
the extreme forms of quackery practised under 
the name of phrenology are not traceable to him 
or to the doctrines to which his teachings properly 
led, that some of the results of the phrenologists 
find analogies in the results of the modern " locali- 
zationists," — and yet it is still truer that the spirit 
and results of phrenology at its best are totally out 
of relation with the spirit and the results of that 
form of intellectual endeavor from which the ripe 
and nutritious fruits of science have sprung. It is 
80 easy to produce a travesty of the facts and argu- 
ments of science, — of which, indeed, this able and 
painstaking work is a remarkable example ; the 
line that divides truth from error, the sublime from 
the ridiculous, is often so tortuous and indistinct

that it requires the most carefal and trained scratiny 
to distinguish the boundaries of the two. It is this 
power that forms one of the goals of a real educa- 
tion. It may be that somewhere in the arbitrary 
and logic-less teachings of phrenology is to be fonnd 
much of the cream of science ; but if so, it is safe 
to say that the cream has turned sour. 



An echo from, 
Ardm* Fvrttt, 



" How Jacques Came into the For- 
est of Arden " is the title of an 
attractive little hand - made book 
lately issued from the Blue Sky Press, Chicago. 
This " impertinence," as its author, Mrs. Elia W. 
Peattie, modestly calls it, is an original bit of read- 
ing between Shakespeare's lines, or rather between 
his acts. Jacques, for once garrulous and lucid at 
the same moment, stretches Arden-fashion in the 
shade and explains himself to Amiens, taking as 
his text that oracular reply of his to Rosalind's 
scornful arraignment : " Yes, I have gained my 
experience." It is a strange tale he has to tell, — 
t>f the Lady Lucinda, whose wondrous " moonlit 
beauty " drove him mad first for love and then for 
bate, of the revenge he took upon her, and the 
farewell of her that brought him, curttongued and 
melancholic, to share the Duke's exile ; and in the 
main he tells it as Jacques should. One wishes, to 
be sure, that he had once again " met a fool i' the 
forest," and been made to unburden himself to 
Touchstone in riddles as of old. It is hard to fancy 
Jacques, the poseur, the lover of two-edged words, 
suddenly grown quite so frank and simple or so 
tolerant of Amiens's humble understanding. But 
out of this too-mellowed urbanity the old Jacques 
breaks every now and then with a gibe or an epi- 
gram polished to his own delightful shine. And 
the little idyl is touched throughout with the spirit 
of Arden Forest. One wishes there were more of 
this sort of Shakespearean comment. The book is 
made to fit its contents, with antique board covers, 
hand-illuminated initials, and some dainty pen 
drawings, which add much to its quaint charm. 



periodleal 
mfaetimile. 



It has been known for several years 
that Mr. Elliot Stock, the London 
publisher, was at work upon a reprint 
in facsimile of " The Germ," that most interesting 
and most inaccessible of all fugitive periodicals. 
Indeed the project was formed nearly twenty years 
ago ; but it was found that certain of the magazine's 
contributors were averse to having their youthful 
writings resurrected in this way, and it became 
necessary to postpone publication until expirations 
of copyright should make such minor objections 
unavailing. The original editor of " The Germ," 
Mr. William M. Rossetti, was one of the first who 
consented to the enterprise (representing also his 
more famous brother and sister in the matter), and 
was engaged to contribute an Introduction to the 
edition. In the form in which it is finally issued, 
Mr. Stock's reprint bears evidence that the years 
of delay have been utilized to perfect the work in 



every detail, and it would be difficult to say wherein 
it could now be improved. The frontispiece etch- 
ings and outside wrappers are reproduced by photo- 
graphic process ; the text is reprinted from type, 
following the original line for line and letter for 
letter, typographical errors included. The four 
nambers of the magazine are loosely enclosed in a 
handsome case of paper-covered boards, bearing 
the title in gilt on back and side. Mr. Rossetti's 
Introduction, filling some twenty-five closely-printed 
pages, is contained in a separate pamphlet of ani- 
form size. Coming from the pen of one more 
intimately acquainted with the history of " The 
Germ " than any other man now living, it must be 
at once accepted as the most authoritative, as it 
certainly is the fullest, account of this '< amazing 
publication " that has yet appeared. It is needless 
to say that through this successful undertaking, Mr. 
Stock has placed every student of Victorian litera- 
ture in his debt. In the matter of price, there is a 
difference of some hundreds of dollars between this 
reprint and a set of the original magazine ; as re- 
gards actual desirability there is no other than a 
purely sentimental difference. The 250 copies 
imported for sale in America bear the imprint of 
Mr. Thomas 6. Mosher, who will be remembered 
as the publisher of the beautiful edition (in no sense 
a facsimile) of " The Germ " issued in 1898, and 
long since out of print. 

In Messrs. Greenough and Kitt- 
i,'^V^^ redge's "Words and their Ways in 

English Speech" (Macmillan) we 
have a history of the development of the English 
language in which the authors strike out boldly into 
new and hitherto little-trodden paths. A large part 
of the histories of Lounsbury and Emerson, for 
example, is given np to the matter of inflections. 
In the work before us, however, inflections are dis- 
posed of in a dozen pages ; while the book includes 
discussions of such topics as " Language as Poetry," 
" Fossils," " Generalization and Specialization of 
Meaning," " Transference of Meaning," " Degen- 
eration of Meaning," "Euphemism," words from 
animal, place, and personal names, and the like. 
Such chapters, filled with such a wealth of illustra- 
tion, could not have been written a few years ago, 
and show what a debt we owe the workers on the 
great Historical English Dictionary and other phil- 
ologists whom that book has stimulated to under- 
take special investigations of our speech. The 
authors have not been slow to incorporate the re- 
sults of the most recent studies, especially those of 
the science of meanings. And they have not merely 
copied etymologies ; we find here several independ- 
ent studies of the changes words have undergone. 
Throughout the book one sees traces of the profes- 
sor of Latin, and one cannot help feeling that the 
book is decidedly the better from the fact that its 
subject-matter has been scrutinized from two points 
of view, that of the English and that of the Latin 
specialist. In expounding the principles which

have governed the development of our complex 
language, and in revealing the wealth of its vocabu- 
lary and explaining the sources of that wealth, the 
writers have been eminently successful. Whether 
the book will prove a satisfactory college text-book 
can be better told a year hence ; but as a popular 
though accurate exposition of a subject which has 
always been of the utmost importance, and which 
no one can now pronounce uninteresting, we do not 
hesitate to call it the ablest work which has yet 
appeared in its field. 

"Great Religions of the World" 

Religion, progres» ^Harper & Brothers) is the title of 

xnthelatt century, v ' . '' 

a collection of essays by eleven dif- 
ferent writers. Some of the most prominent of the 
papers are " Confucianism " by Dr. Giles of Gam- 
bridge, " Buddhism " by Dr. Rhys Davids of Lon- 
don, " Brahminism " by Sir A. C. Lyall, " Positiv- 
.ism " by Frederic Harrison, " Sikhism " by Sir 
Lepel GriflBn, "Jews and Judaism" by Dr. M. 
Gaster, " The Outlook of Christianity " by Wash- 
ington Gladden, and " Catholic Christianity " by 
Cardinal Gibbons. The treatment of the themes is 
very uneven and of unequal value. Some are dis- 
cussed historically, such as Sikhism and Babism, 
while others are a recital of the doctrines and 
power of the faith under survey. Of the eleven 
papers embodied in the volume, six — possibly 
seven — only can be counted as dealing with " great 
religions of the world." These are Confucianism, 
Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Brahminism, Zoro- 
astrianism, Christianity, and Judaism. Of these 
seven, the essay on Confucianism is a fair presen- 
tation of the growth of that faith in the last century. 
Dr. Davids pictures the recent spread and power of 
Buddhism in the East. Mohammedanism is set 
before us in all its glory as seen in its conquests 
during the last few decades. The essay on Zoro- 
astrianism is both historical and doctrinal in treat- 
ment. Dr. Gladden's " Outlook of Christianity " 
is a presentation of figures, numerical and geo- 
graphical, of Christendom, and the modifications of 
doctrines and beliefs brought about by the investi- 
gations of recent years. Dr. Gaster's essay pictures 
in vivid terms the struggles for liberty through 
which the Jews have passed, especially on the con- 
tinent of Europe within the last century. Such a 
collection of essays has its value, but the disparity 
in methods and purpose of presentation is too great 
to give it first place among books on the great re- 
ligions of the world. 

The life and "Brother Musicians," a brief biog- 

letterto/ttoo raphy of Edward and Walter Bache 

£ngii»hmuHciani. ^^tten by their sister, is an unpre- 
tentious record of the lives of two gifted English- 
men. It is somewhat belated in appearance, as the 
elder brother died in 1858, and the younger in 
1888, but it has the interest which always belongs 
to the story of genius triumphing over difficulties. 
The brothers' letters to their family from Leipzig, 



Rome, and other musical centres, make up a con- 
siderable part of the volume. These letters give 
entertaining and often intimate glimpses of Wagner, 
Liszt, and many lesser musicians, as well as a quite 
unconscious revelation of the refined, enthusiastic 
natures of the brothers themselves, and the unsel- 
fishness of their devotion to the cause of music 
Edward Bache's letters on the advantages to a city 
of placing the best orchestral music within the 
reach of the poor deserve a place in the literature 
of philanthropy as well as of music. His compari- 
son of the Wagnerian and Italian schools is also 
valuable for its clearness, though perhaps too pre- 
mature to be sound in theory. A peculiar interest 
is given to the book by the fact that, in spite of 
similarity of character and early training, the Bache 
brothers took wholly different paths in music. Ed- 
ward was a composer and followed the old school, 
believing that after Beethoven's death music in 
Germany " had taken a false direction." His own 
early death at twenty-five rendered futile his ambi- 
tion to create an English opera founded on the 
Italian. Walter was a pianist and teacher, and an 
ardent follower of the newer school. He is remem- 
bered as the champion and interpreter of Liszt's 
music in England. The volume is published by 
Messrs. James Pott & Co. 



Welsh history Mr. A. G. Bradley's recent work on 
and a great " Highways and Byways in North 
WeUhhero. Wales" showed that author's apti- 
tude and enthusiasm in the treatment of Welsh 
history. The latest effort of his facile pen in the 
same direction is a volume on Owen Glyndwr, in 
Putnams' " Heroes of the Nations " series. The 
first eighty pages are a condensed history of Wales 
from its first historic records down to 1400, or from 
400-1400. The brevity of the treatment makes 
this section quite unsatisfactory to the reader. Such 
condensation is always a hazardous undertaking. 
But the body of the book, on the other hand, treat- 
ing of the last struggle for Welsh independence as 
led by Owen Glyndwr, is rather diluted. On the 
whole, however, the author has written an interest- 
ing narrative, has deftly woven in the facts of his- 
tory and many of the popular traditions of the hero, 
so as to bring out with great prominence some of 
the best elements of Welsh valor, persistency, and 
endurance. One cannot read this volume without 
gaining a new conception of the character of the 
Welsh people, particularly in their valiant and vain 
struggle against the aggressions of the kings of 
England. The book is well-illustrated by half-tone 
cuts of some of the most famous castles of Wales, 
that figured prominently in the wars of Owen 
Glyndwr.

F.R.H.S.; for the author thereof writes entertain- 
ingly upon a subject with which he is thoroughly 
acquainted. He has written within the last decade, 
besides " The Story of Our English Towns," several 
books upon rural life in England and upon old En- 
glish sports and custooas. The avowed purpose of 
the present volume is to call attention to the rich- 
ness of the English villages, not only in mediaeval 
relics, but, in many cases, in Roman remains and 
in prehistoric monuments ; to exhibit the process 
by which the part of the " scientiBc detective " may 
be undertaken by the ordinary student, and what 
facts concerning primitive man in England may be 
developed from an investigation of the turmdi, 
barrows, pit and pile dwellings, cromlechs, camps, 
and earthworks, to be found scattered throughout 
the island. Nor does he slight the historic periods 
and the features of village life in " Merrie En- 
gland " which are of never-failing interest. Full- 
page illustrations, and text cuts to the number of 
one hundred, enhance both the appearance of the 
book and the author's treatment of his subject. 

The startling and sometimes almost 
\^i^*i'^,'^'"'f incredible revelations offered in "The 

of Turkej/'t ruler. . ,, ,. , 

Private Life of the Sultan (Apple- 
ton) are, naturally enough, pseudonymous in author- 
ship. ''George Dorys," as is explained in the 
translator's preface, is the assumed name of the 
son of the late Prince of Samos, one of Abdul- 
Hamid's ministers and sometime governor of Crete. 
The author thus had abundant opportunity to gain 
inside information, and he appears to write from 
personal knowledge. Terrible is the picture he 
draws of the man whom Gladstone called <' the 
great assassin." The charitable reader will hope 
that this despot is really not quite so fiendishly 
cruel and cunning as he is represented. Other and 
less forbidding portraits of him incline one to sus- 
pect that Mr. Dorys may have written in a mood 
not wholly free from prejudice. But the truth 
would seem to be almost as hard to get at as is the 
Sultan himself in his double and triple walled seclu- 
sion. His elaborate precautions against assassina- 
tion, his childish fear of the dark, and his abject 
dread of death, certainly bespeak something other 
than " a still and quiet conscience." This volume 
maintains the high standard of interest and excel- 
lence of workmanship of the " Lives of Royalties " 
series in which it appears. 

Some intimate ^^' William C. Todd, president of 
tketehft of fammti the New Hampshire Historical So- 

Kexc Englander,. ^.j^^y^ -g ^jjg ;^uthoT of a volume of 

"Biographical and Other Articles" (Lee & Shep- 
ard), dealing with Daniel Webster, Caleb Cushing, 
and others, largely New Englanders, whose lives 
have been of moment in American history. The 
material here gathered together has been in con- 
siderable degree a part of the personal experience 
of the writer, and so, while gaining in authenticity 
and personal nearness, they are but incomplete 



portraits that he presents. Although as a whole 
the book is inorganic, there is in it a great deal of 
valuable matter, which it needed only a more pleas- 
ing literary style to make extremely interesting. 
An account of "A Summer in Norway," and the 
chapter entitled '• Some Persons I Have Seen," 
have rather less of the stilted literary quality of a 
bygone day ; but here as elsewhere the author's 
sense of values does not seem to be very sure. Such 
information as the volume contains is of a sort not 
easily accessible ; much, perhaps, is not to be found 
elsewhere ; and it is to be regretted that there is 
no index to make its real wealth of anecdote and 
story more available. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



It would be unreasonable to ask for a handsomer 
school edition of the "iEaeid" than is provided by Dr. 
Charles Knapp in his recently published volume. The 
first six books are given complete, and are followed by 
extracts from the six remaining ones. There is an intro- 
duction, historical, biographical, critical, and syntactical, 
of one hundred pages. There are copious notes (with the 
text) and a vocabulary. Interspersed among the books of 
the epic are full-page plates of famous works of ancient 
sculpture. The whole is bound in half-leather of restful 
dark green. Our only quarrel with the book is that it 
sanctions the wanton pedantry of the spelling " Vergil." 
Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. are the publishers. 

Through " The Mighty Deep and What We Know 
of It " (Lippincott), by Miss Agnes Giberne, a fair con- 
ception of the new science of oceanography and its aims 
and achievements may be had, set in language suffi- 
ciently popular to appeal to those wholly ignorant of 
its existence. With the discussions of the tides and 
their causes, the salt in the ocean and its sources, gla- 
ciers, the great ocean currents and several similar 
phenomea, the physical geographies have made us famil- 
iar. But in the descriptiuns of the curious animals 
dredged from vast depths, the varied proofs of the ex- 
istence of active life in even the profoundest valleys 
covered by the sea, and the habits of sea monsters of 
every size and most extraordinary shape, Miss Giberne 
finds an almost undiscovered country for the informa- 
tion of her readers. Xumerons illustrations, of rather 
unequal value, add to the interest of the volume. 

There is a great deal of pathos in a life that is in 
some way devoted to the interest of culture while never 
attaining culture for itself. Some such sense of the 
irony of fate must come to one who reads Mr. E. Mars- 
ton's " Sketches of Booksellers of Other Days " (im- 
ported by Scribner), so pitifully outside the currents of 
thought and feeling fed by the books they sold do many 
of them seem. The sketches cover a period from 
the middle of the seventeenth century to the year of 
Waterloo, and contain a great many things to interest 
the curious. The miseries of apprenticeship are more 
than hinted at and the stern economy of one who would 
rise from proverty to a competance are told again and 
again. Though the sketches are in the main but per- 
sonal histories touching little upon the larger concerns 
of men, they have a very real interest for those who care 
to know so much of the setting of authors' lives two 
centuries ago.

Notes. 



" Lessons in Elementary Grammar," by Mr. George 
A. Mirick, is a recent school publication of the Mac- 
millan Co. 

'« Latin Composition Based upon Selections from 
Cffisar," by Professor Benjamin L. D'Ooge, is a recent 
publication of Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

" The Book of the Greenhouse," by Mr. J. C. Tallack, 
is the second volume in the series of " Handbooks of 
Practical Gardening," published by Mr. John Lane. 

The B. F. Johnson Publishing Co., Richmond, Vir- 
ginia, send us a school text of " Macaulay's Essays on 
Milton and Addison," edited by Professor C. Alphonso 
Smith. 

" Cicero: Select Orations," edited by Professor Ben- 
jamin L. D'Ooge, is an addition to " The Student's 
Series of Latin Classics" published by Messrs. Ben- 
jamin H. Sanborn & Co. 

A new translation, supplied with original illustrations, 
of " Sintram and his Companions " is published by the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. in a dainty little volume. Mr. 
A. M. Richards is the translator. 

"Original Investigation; or. How to Attack an Ex- 
ercise in Geometry," by Mr. Elisha S. Loomis, is a 
small book which will be found useful by teachers of 
mathematics. Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publishers. 

" Elementary Experimental Chemistry " is a text- 
book and laboratory manual for secondary schools. It 
deals with inorganic chemistry only, and is the work of 
Professor W. F. Watson. Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. 
are the publishers. 

A translation of Tasso's " Amyntas," (but not the 
first, as the title-page claims), has been made by Mr. 
Frederic Whitmore, and published at the Ridgewood 
Press, Springfield, Mass. It makes an oblong pamphlet, 
and is prettily illustrated. 

" The Story of Books," by Miss Gertrude Burford 
Rawlings, is an addition to the Messrs. Appletons' 
" Library of Useful Stories." It is mainly a popular 
account of mediaeval libraries and the work of the 
early presses, with numerous illustrations. 

Mr. Gerald H. Rendall's " Marcus Aurelius Antoninus 
to Himself " is now published by the Macmillan Co. in 
the familiar " Golden Treasury " form. The translation 
has been revised and the introduction abridged, the 
book aiming at the general reader rather than at the 
student. 

Walter Bagehot's essay on " Shakespeare the Man " 
is reprinted by Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co. in a 
volume which is rather striking in its mechanical make- 
up, and is remarkable for its inexpensiveness. Bagehot 
is such good reading that we hope for more of him in 
this form. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. publish the seventh 
edition of Mr. C. W. C. Oman's " History of Greece 
from the Earliest Times to the Death of Alexander the 
Great." The work has been revised throughout, and 
even draws upon such recent material as the Cretan 
discoveries of Mr. Evans. 

A volume on " Russian Political Institutions," by 
Maxime Kovalevsky, formerly Professor of Public Law 
at the University of Moscow, is announced for publica- 
tion this month by the University of Chicago Press. 
The work is based upon a series of lectures delivered 
at the University last summer. 



The beautiful typography of the Merrymount Press 
adorns Professor John Franklin Genung's thoughtful 
essay on " Stevenson's Attitude to Life," which the 
Messrs. Crowell have made into a thin volume. It is a 
pleasure to read such a book as this, and a further 
pleasure to own it and see it lying on the table. 

Of editions of Boswell's " Life of Johnson " there are 
seemingly no end. The latest on our list comes from 
the J. B. Lippincott Co., in six handsome library vol- 
umes, edited by Mr. Augustine Birrell. The special 
feature of this edition is a series of portraits, about one 
hundred in number, selected with great care by Mr. 
Ernest Radford. 

The " Centiloquio " of Santillana is a Spanish text, 
edited, with educational intent, by Messrs. Fernando 
Stand y Ximenez and Hubert M. Skinner. There are 
notes and a vocabulary for the student. An appendix 
gives a selection of Spanish proverbs, in both the origi- 
nal and translation. Messrs. Laird & Lee are the pub- 
lishers of this welcome little book. 

What will form the first complete edition of Thomas 
Kyd's extant works is about to be published by the Ox- 
ford University Press. Mr. F. S. Boas, who has edited 
the works from the original texts, states in his Preface 
that in the recent study of Pre- Shakespearean literature 
there has been no more marked feature, especially on 
the Continent, than the increased prominence given to 
Kyd. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. send us ten new volumes 
in their dainty " What Is Worth While " series. Among 
the titles are •' The Meaning and Value of Poetry," by 
Mr. W. H. Hudson ; " Standeth God within the Shadow," 
by President D. S. Jordan; " Ecclesiastes and Omar 
Khayydm," by Professor J. F. Genung; "The Great- 
ness of Patience," by President A. T. Hadley; and 
" Religion in Common Life," by the late Principal 
Caird. 

« The Lyric and Dramatic Poems of John Milton," 
edited by Professor Martin W. Sampson, is the latest 
number of the " English Readings" published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. The introductory essay is elaborate, 
as is usual in the books of this excellent series, and the 
notes are almost equal in volume to the text. A collec- 
tion of " Questions and Comments" and an appendix on 
" Milton's Metres" complete the apparatus of this edi- 
tion. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. publish in this country 
"The Self-Educator Series," an English enterprise 
under the editorship of Mr. John Adams of Glasgow. 
There are four volumes now issued: " Latin," by Mr. 
W. A. Edward; "Chemistry," by Mr. James Knight; 
and " French " and " German," both by the general 
editor of the series. The aim of these books is explained 
by their title, although there is no reason why they 
should not be used in schools as well as at home. 

Mr. Charles Welsh, who has made practically a life 
study of the subject of children's reading, has now 
nearly completed a "Young Folks Library" of the 
world's best literature for children. The work will com- 
prise twenty volumes, containing altogether more than 
one thousand selections from every department of liter- 
ature. The selections in each volume have been ap- 
proved by well-known specialists, who have also pro- 
vided the Introductions, and the whole work has been 
submitted to the final critical judgment of Mr. Thomas 
Bailey Aldrich. The Hall & Locke Co. of Boston are 
named as the publishers of this important undertaking.

" The Love Letters of Abelard and Heloise," reprinted 
from the anonymous translation of Watt's edition of 
1722, forms a particularly acceptable volume in the 
" Temple Classics" (Macmillan). Miss Honnor Morten, 
who edits the edition, has elucidated the text with a 
number of valuable notes. Another recent volume in 
the same series is a metrical translation by Mr. Arthur 
S. Way of " The Tale of the Argonauts" by Apollonius 
of Rhodes. Both volumes are supplied with the usual 
dainty frontispiece in photogravure. 

The collection of " Lives of the English Saints," as 
written by various hands at the suggestion of Cardinal 
Newman, is republished by the Messrs. Lippiucott in a 
very attractive six-volume edition. This is the first 
complete reprint of the work since the origiual publica- 
tion of 1844—5. The editorial introduction is by Mr. 
Arthur Wollaston Hutton. Each volume has one or 
two portrait illustrations, the subjects being modern 
scholars and churchmen. We note particularly the 
fine portraits of J. A. Froude and Mark Pattison. 

Two volumes of more than ordinary literary interest 
will be issued shortly by Mr. John Laue. One of the 
two is Mr. William Archer's collection of critical essays 
on "The Poets of the Younger Generation"; the other 
is an elaborate work on *' Jane Austen: Her Homes and 
her Friends," by Miss Constance Hill. The illustrations 
will be a special feature of each book, consisting in the 
former case of thirty-three portraits engraved on wood 
by Mr. Robert Bryden, and in the latter of drawings 
by Miss Ellen G. Hill and several photogravure por- 
traits.

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, snch as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Oosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and "Richard Hakluyt's Dia- 
coorse on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

The ROAD to RIDGEBY'S 

By FRANK BURLINGAME HARRIS 

" Here is a grood story," says The Bookman, " and one that should not be lost sight of in the avalanche of antnmn 
pablications. There is something aboiit it so real, so spontaneous, so simple that one is glad to pass it on with com- 
mendation. 

" When I took np this book," writes one of the most distinguished authors in the United States, " I fonnd it so 
' worth while ' that I spent an evening finishing it at a sitting. The story is a genuine outcome of American soil, 
speech, talent, and I hope it will be ' found out ' by the press and public." 

"A romance full of action, truth, pathos, and genuine humor," writes Elia W. Peattie in the Chicago Tribune. 

"Unquestionably one of the best novels of the year, and an addition to American literature that will live," says 
Town ana Country. __^^^^__^__^

ANIMALS 

By Wallace Rice. Illustrated by 48 pictures in color. Octavo, cloth, $2.00 net. 
A book which describes for both old and young the characteristics and habits of wild animals in a most 
entertaining and breezy way. It makes them alive and vivid to the imagination. One of the chief features 
of the book is the splendid collection of animal portraits. These illustrations are included in the volume 
by an arrangement with the Nature Study Co., who furnished the illustrations for " Bird Neighbors." 

RUSKIN'S PRINCIPLES OF ART CRITICISM 

By Ida M. Street, sometime Western Collegiate Alumni Fellow in English Literature 
at the University of Michigan. 12mo, cloth, $1.60 net. 
Students find Ruskin's principles of art scattered through so many volumes, and so interwoven with 
criticisms of life and literature, without any attempt to arrange them in a convenient form for comparison 
or reference, that they often fail to get a clear conception of his principles of art in their relation to each 
other. The purpose of this book is to meet this difficulty by setting forth in detail Ruskin's philosophy of 
art. Its aim is to aid the general student in forming a standard by which to judge all works of art, and 
not simply to discuss technical points in the criticism of pictures. 

THE GOLFER'S RUBAIYAT 

By H. W. BoYNTON. With decorative borders. 16mo, $1.00. 
A very amusing little volume of quotations in Omar's style, embellished with borders, showing the 
Oriental popularity of golf and its accompanying pleasures. With notes.

344 THE DIAL [Nov. 16, 



An account of what went on and the stories that were told at a 
gathering of famous American authors, the story- 
tellers being introduced by 

Paul Leicester Ford 

the literary host of the occasion. 

LAST spring plans were made by Messrs. Small, Maynard & Company for what may be 
called a literary " House Party." The idea was suggested by a casual discussion of the 
ear-marks of authorship. What is it that distinguishes the work of one writer from that of 
another ? Is it style or a difference in the point of view ? Could you tell who wrote a story 
if the author's name was not given ? The questions were so interesting that it was determined 
to submit them to the reading public. 
Invitations to the " House Party " were extended to the following distinguished authors : 

THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH HAMLIN GARLAND F. HOPKINSON SMITH 

JOHN KENDRICK BANGS ROBERT GRANT FRANK R. STOCKTON 

GEORGE W. CABLE JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS RUTH McENERY STUART 

WINSTON CHURCHILL Mrs. BURTON HARRISON BOOTH TARKINGTON 

MARION CRAWFORD W. D. HOWELLS OCTAVE THANET 

MARGARET DELAND SARAH ORNE JEWETT MARK TWAIN 

PAUL LEICESTER FORD THOMAS NELSON PAGE MARY E. WILKINS 

JOHN FOX, Jr. CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS OWEN WISTER 

BERTHA RUNKLE 

Each author was to contribute one story, the stories to be published anonymously. The public 
was then to be invited to guess the authorship, and to add zest to the contest it was decided to 
offer a prize of 

$1000.00 for the Right Quess 

Twelve of the authors above named accepted and have each told one story. These stories are 
all published together in our latest book, entitled "A HOUSE PARTY," which will appeal 
not only to every person of literary taste, but to every lover of good stories. Ready Nov. 2j. 

CONDITIONS OF THE CONTEST 

Are given in full in the book, together with a guessing coupon, which is to be detached and 
mailed to the publishers. If more than one person guesses the correct authorship of the twelve 
stories, the thousand dollars will be divided among the winners. If no correct answer is 
received, the nearest correct will win the prize. All guesses must be in by December 31.

The Atlantic Monthly 

A Brief Outline for 1902. 

THE ATLANTIC takes pleasure in announcing that upon the completion of Audrey the serial feature 
of the magazine will be provided by George William Cable. Mr. Cable's novel is a short one, 
and will be printed in three or four installments. Its title is Bylow Hill. The admirers of Mr. Cable's 
work will be interested to know that its scene is laid, not in the South, but in the New England country 
which the anthor has now adopted as his home. 

Announcement will shortly be made of another serial story by a well-known writer, beginning in mid- 
summer of 1902. r A • ^ 

Groups of Articles 

Among the groups of articles which the Atlantic will publish may be noted a series of papers dealing 
with Disfranchisement, and other aspects of the race question. Leaders of the colored race, prominent 
public men, and students of contemporary politics, have promised to take part in this discussion. Other 
groups of papers will include Education in the Philippines and Cuba, Religious Toleration in the Territories, 
Colonial Legislatures, Army Reorganization, and the Normal Development of the Navy. The Atlantic will 
continue to devote space to the discussion of this country's new diplomatic problems and trade relations. 
Among those papers will be one upon The Latin-American Republics, by the Hon. John W. Foster, 
ex-Secretary of State. The question of the proper limits of the organization of labor will be the subject 
of another group of articles by Ambrose P. Winston. 

Confessions 

Some of the most effective Atlantic papers have been the anonymous confessions of representatives 
of various professions or stations in life. Two papers of this character will shortly appear in this magazine 
— Confessions of a Provincial Editor, who describes his attempt to run an " Independent Daily " in a small 
city, and Our State University, by one who has seen a State University " from the under side."

SCHOLARSHI P AN D CULTURE. 

The higher education of to-day, with all its 
endowments and auxiliaries, with all the re- 
sources of wealth and men at its command, is 
still open to one of the gravest of charges. Its 
fundamental aim seems to be the production of 
scholarly acquirement rather than of cultivated 
intelligence. Because scholarship is pedestrian 
in its methods, and requires only industrious 
application for its achievement, and because 
culture is to be attained only in more difficult 
ways, and under more genial guidance, our 
universities manifest a strong tendency to seek 
the path of least resistance in their educational 
effort, and to direct their activities toward 
securing results that make an imposing quan- 
titative showing, but that leave much to be de- 
sired in the quality of the product. The old 
antithesis between scholarship and culture has 
never been more strongly marked than in the 
educational programmes of the present day, 
and the need has never been more urgent of 
making a plea for the neglected interests of 
the latter. More and more do our universities 
tend to send out into the fields of thought 
young men who are narrow specialists ; less and 
less do they tend to encourage the broad- 
minded development of the intellect that cul- 
ture demands. 

In the complexity and variety of modern 
education, there are whole tracts of thought 
that may be frankly abandoned to the claims 
of pure scholarship. The entire region of 
science, mathematical, physical, biological, and 
social, may be yielded without demur to the 
work of minute investigation, orderly clas- 
sification, and logical construction. Culture is 
to be had from these subjects, but knowledge, 
and the applications of knowledge, constitute 
the immediate, and, to a considerable extent, 
the sole aim with which they are pursued. But 
humanity is a finer thing than knowledge, and 
the subjects whose consideration makes for 
humanity must suffer degradation if we permit 
ourselves to lose sight of their essential excel- 
lence. These subjects are those of the literary 
and artistic groups, and, largely also, those of 
the historical group, although in this latter 
domain mere scholarship has some claims that 
are legitimate. What the advocates of culture 



352

[Nov. 16, 



and of humane education are bound to resist 
most strenuously, and if need be to the death, 
is the intrusion of scientific methods in the 
narrow sense, and the futile industry of the 
philological or historical specialist, into the 
pursuit of literary studies. 

This subject is not a new one. It has for 
many years engaged the pens and the persuasive 
powers of able men having the interests of the 
humanities at heart. But the tendency against 
which our protest is declared remains persist- 
ent, and as long as it controls the teaching of 
the literary classics, whether ancient or modern, 
in any large number of our universities, it must 
be combated without ceasing, even with much 
repetition and the laboring of the simplest 
points. Mr. Churton Collins has said many a 
strong and vital word upon this theme in con- 
nection with the study of modern literature, 
and we do not hesitate to reproduce some of 
his observations, even at the risk of presenting 
ideas that will seem hackneyed to those who 
of late years have been following this conflict 
of educational ideals. 

" To say that the anarchy which has resulted from 
confusing the distinction between the study and inter- 
pretation of Literature as the expression of art and 
genius, and its study and interpretation as a mere mon- 
ument of language, has had a more disastrous effect on 
education generally, would be to state very imperfectly 
the truth of the case. It has led to inadequate and 
even false conceptions of what constitutes Literature. It 
has led to all that is of essential importance in literary 
study being ignored, and all that is of secondary or 
accidental interest being preposterously magnified ; to 
the substitution of grammatical and verbal commentary 
for the relation of a literary masterpiece to history, to 
philosophy, to aesthetics, to the mechanical inculcation 
of all that can be imparted, as it has been acquired, by 
cramming, for the intelligent application of principles 
to expression. It has led to the severance of our Lit- 
erature from all that constitutes its vitality and virtue 
as an active power, and from all that renders its de- 
velopment and peculiarities intelligible as a subject of 
historical study. In a word, it has led to a total mis- 
conception of the ends at which literary instruction 
should aim, as well as of its most appropriate instru- 
ments and methods." 

This indictment, severe as it is, does not exag- 
gerate the alarming conditions of literary study 
in the majority of our universities, and indicates 
clearly the need of a far-reaching reform. 

In the study of the ancient classics, even 
more than in the study of modern literature, 
the same unfortunate conditions obtain, and 
the young student's passport to success and 
professional advancement is too often found, 
not in his power to interpret the ideas upon 
which literature is based, and which make it 
significant, but rather upon the ingenuity with 



which its mechanical aspects are paraded, or 
the meticulous work of linguistic and syntac- 
tical analysis. This, too, is an old story, but 
the importance of classical studies in the de- 
velopment of culture is so great that their 
friends cannot remain silent while their very 
existence is jeopardized. Classical studies are 
already too much discredited by the men of 
their own household, and the most dangerous 
foe of these studies is the man who, while 
posing as their champion, does his best to de- 
stroy their vitality by ignoring their lasting^ 
claims to our consideration. 

The immediate suggestion for the above 
observations was provided us by a paper on 
" Classical Teaching in Italy," written for " La 
Kassegna Internazionale " by Signor Enrico 
Corradini. Of all countries in the world, Italy 
should be bound to preserve the methods of 
the humanities in its teaching of the classics — 
Italy, the birthplace of Latin literature, and one 
of the ancient seats of Greek civilization. But 
even Italy has failed in its obligations, and 
allowed its classical teaching to degenerate into 
textual and philological investigations, inta 
minute studies of historical and archasological 
questions. Signor Corradini's personal recol- 
lections are so much to the point that we have 
thought it best to translate his own words inta 
English. 

" To begin with a recollection of my own, when at 
the age of eighteen I entered the university for my 
first course in letters, my first compliment from one of 
the professors was this : Don't you know German, yoa 
must learn German if you wish to profit by your 
studies. I was a youth of moderate intelligence, mod- 
erately desirous of learning; I wished to become a 
fairly good teacher or a fairly good writer; I had en- 
tered the university knowing Italian and Latin pretty 
well, and Greek after a fashion; but I could have ex- 
pected anything rather than that an Italian youth, de- 
sirous of perfecting himself in the literature of his 
country and in the ancient literatures of which it is the 
outgrowth, should be advised to begin by learning 
German. I suddenly perceived that I and the worthy 
professor who gave me that advice must be two persons 
by nature irreconcilable, and this irreconcilability was 
soon manifested between me and the other professors, 
between the little Greek and Latin and Italian taught 
me in the good old fashion in the college of priests and 
the much Greek and Latin and Italian which they 
wished to teach me, scientifically and by modern meth- 
ods, in the university. Thus my four or five years of 
the university were for me, and, God helping me, will 
remain, the most Beotian of my whole life. What had 
happened? I had found the historical method, natu- 
rally the German, in full flower at the university; that 
is to say, a manner of teaching on the part of the pro- 
fessors and a manner of learning on the part of my 
fellow-students in no wise corresponding to my intel- 
lectual and moral inclinations, whether I wished to be-

THE DIAL

come a fair teacher or a fair man of letters, not corre- 
sponding to the nature of those same classical studies, 
or their genial tradition among us since the days of the 
Renaissance, not corresponding to the purpose of pre- 
paring youths for teaching, to the vital character of our 
people, to the ambition of any intellect or any talent, 
however modest. I found, in short, in place of geni- 
ality and moral consciousness patient, frivolous, and 
f ntile research ; in place of any attempt of the spirit of 
man, brought into contact with the most beautiful lit- 
erature in the world, to impart its fire and force to 
hundreds of youths, I found certain cold and dull ultra- 
montane senilities forcing youths to Benedictine tasks 
of minute philology and minute history, that they might 
acquire a perfectly useless education de luxe, whatever 
serious work they might otherwise have wished to do. 
In place of what we are accustomed to call belles-lettres, 
I found a scientific criticism, so-called by the ridiculous 
vanity of those who practice it. Homer and Demos- 
thenes, Virgil and Csesar, Dante and Petrarch, as if 
not sufficiently outraged by the fate that for centuries 
turned them over to priests and monks, had suffered 
final disaster by falling into the hands of the new 
Byzantines from Austria and Prtissia." 

The language is strong, but who shall say 
that the strictures are unjust? Those who 
make themselves the partisans of this sort of 
classical teaching are apt to say that they are 
opposing positive knowledge to the nebulous 
theories of the rhetoricians and aestheticians. 
But these may also claim a positive character 
for their teachings, and they may add, further- 
more, in the words of our present advocate, 
that when classical instruction in Italy was in 
the hands of the rhetorical £estheticians, '* the 
classical authors were read because they are 
great poets, because they are great artists, be- 
cause they are great philosophers, because they 
tell us great things, because they are the mir- 
ror of noble life and the witness of fair 
humanity." And again, " if Greek and Latin 
are studied throughout the world, it is because 
the people who spoke those languages were in 
large measure the fathers of our modern civili- 
zation, and civilization is humanity, not Byzan- 
tine erudition ; if Greek and Latin are studied 
throughout the world, it is because in them is 
expressed the maximum potency of life, fair 
and strong, speculative and active, with which 
men and races have ever been animated, and 
this too is humanity, not erudition." We 
should like to reproduce this vigorous and elo- 
quent argument at greater length, did space per- 
mit ; as it is, we are glad to have had the oppor- 
tunity of calling thus much of attention to it, 
and of affirming our belief that it represents 
an ideal of teaching that now more than ever 
is needed in the work of higher education, both 
in Europe and in our own country. 



SOME RECENT PHASES OF ENGLISH 
TE ACHI NG. 

It seems to be generally admitted that no other 
subject which has a place in the present carricola 
of secondary schools is so unorganized pedagogic- 
ally as the study of English. The last decade has 
seen the almost universal adoption in high Echools 
and academies of a distinct method of science in- 
straction — the laboratory method. History, too, 
has developed a pedagogy of its own, in the library 
method which the college is handing down to pre- 
paratory schools having the necessary equipment. 
In the teaching of foreigjn languages, especially of 
Latin and Greek, many of oar difficulties have been 
met by the first-year books in those languages. But 
the comparatively recent introduction into both 
schools and colleges of the formal stndy of English 
has brought into pedagogy a new and perplexing 
problem which has not as yet been solved. We are 
still in search of a scheme of English instruction 
on which all are broadly agreed, one which will do 
for this branch of study what the laboratory method 
has done for science instruction. 

One of the most obvious reasons for this slow 
development of a rational plan for the teaching of 
English is the miscellaneous character of the subject- 
matter itself. Etymology, grammar, formal rhet- 
oric, oral reading, spelling, composition, literary 
history and biography, literary criticism, sometimes 
a coarse in mythology, and the accumulation of a 
vast amount of general information necessary in 
the elucidation of the texts of the authors read, are 
all included under the general term " English." In 
handling this heterogeneous mass of material, it is 
difficult to maintain a point of view which will give 
unity and perspective ° to our teaching and make 
possible a definite and orderly progression from 
year to year. 

We shall speak first of recent phases of English 
teaching on its analytical side, — that is, of methods 
for the critical examination and study of master- 
pieces ; and secondly, of the constructive side of 
the subject, or theme-writing. 

In the study of pieces of literature, the writer 
has been unable to discover any new tendencies at 
all large in their scope or general in their accept- 
ance. The discussion of certain topics connected 
with the particular masterpieces read, the answer- 
ing of questions on the thought or form, and the 
learning of sundry footnotes, make up the body of 
this side of the work. In general it may be said 
that English teaching in its analytical aspect is still 
in bondage to the word-by-word and line-by-line 
method of foreign languages, especially of the 
classics. While one should not undervalue the 
habits of accuracy and precision in thought and 
expression which result from the practice of looking 
intently at words, it must be confessed that it is 
narrow and inadequate as a general plan, for the 



854 



THE DIAL, 



[Nov. 16, 



telescopic view of a piece of literature is often as 
important as the microscopic. To study a poem 
word by word, without realizing its plan or appre- 
ciating the broad sweep of the author's thought, is 
like studying a building brick by brick, without a 
conception of the whole. Many teachers precede 
this intensive study with a rapid reading of the 
whole selection, to give the student an idea of the 
piece as a unit. These two methods are as old as 
literature itself, one of them superficial and the 
other minute to tediousness. We need some new 
thought in this direction ; but the recent text-books 
on English, suggestive as many of them are, do not 
help us. They follow traditional lines in the analy- 
sis and study of literature. 

It is to the constructive side of the subject that 
we must look for a distinct advance. The student's 
own composition is being emphasized at present 
more than any other phase of English study. Even 
the colleges are requiring regular courses in daily 
themes. The student is spending less time upon the 
passive contemplation of the finished masterpiece 
of literature, and is trying his hand more often at 
some construction of his own, however crude. He 
is being taken, as it were, from the picture-gallery 
of literature into the studio or the workshop ; and 
his own work, as in other arts and crafts, is being 
made the basis of the instruction he receives. This 
bringing of constructive work to the front is one of 
the most promising phases of recent thought on 
English teaching. 

Another of the hopeful signs of the time is the 
extension of the sources from which material for 
composition is drawn. The student is no longer 
confined to abstract ideas and the encyclop»diafor 
his thought, but is sent to literature, art, and com- 
mon life for his theme-material. In many schools, 
home reading-books on which the class is required 
to report furnish the subject-matter for composition. 
The college entrance requirements set apart a cer- 
tain number of books to be used in this way. An- 
other means by which material for themes has been 
extended is by the use of pictures. This is a feature 
of some of the newer books on the subject, and is 
derived from the practice of the elementary schools 
which have long made use of both art and literature 
in language work. The third and most important 
source from which students are now encouraged to 
draw their material is common life. We find many 
of the colleges to-day beginning their instruction in 
English with a theme-course that allows the student 
to derive his thought from ordinary experience. 
This is the social side of the study of composition, 
and deserves more emphasis than the aesthetic side 
developed by the study of literature and pictures. 
The result of this enlargement of theme-material is 
to show the young writer that he may find his 
subject-matter in the objective world and is not 
obliged to spin it painfully from the dark recesses 
of his own brain. 



Along with this widening of the thought side of 
composition has gone a narrowing of the scope of 
the formal rhetoric required in any one year, and 
a distribution of the departments of rhetoric, so 
that in many schools narration and description con- 
stitute the first year's work, exposition that of the 
second, argumentation and persuasion that of the 
third, with a review of these five divisions in the 
fourth year. 

Another recent tendency to be noted is the in- 
creasing importance attached to the construction of 
wholes. The complete theme is being made the 
basis of instruction, and is taking the place in some 
measure of miscellaneous exercises on the smaller 
elements of discourse — the word, the sentence, and 
the paragraph. The older rhetorics made exercises 
on these minor elements their chief concern, and 
aimed mainly at mere accuracy in mechanical, 
grammatical, and rhetorical detail. They began 
with the word and ended with the theme. The 
present tendency is to reverse this order, putting 
the theme first. As a mason learns to handle and 
fit his bricks by laying them in an actual wall, so 
the young writer should be taught to handle the 
word, the sentence, and the paragraph, as parts of 
a concrete whole which he is creating. 

It is clear to any one who has been thinking on 
this very perplexing question that this emphasis 
upon the construction of wholes, the extension of 
the thought-side or subject-matter, and the narrow- 
ing of the scope of formal rhetoric to one depart- 
ment at a time, are all tendencies in the right 
direction. And yet we are far from regarding the 
problem as solved. Our recent writers on this sub- 
ject leave the student in the position of an untrained 
workman who is shown the quarry where his stones 
lie, and is told that he is not to spend his time 
chiselling and polishing separate stones, but that 
his work is to build a church in accordance with 
certain general principles of architecture, namely, 
proportion, symmetry, etc., of which laws he has as 
vague a notion as the young student has of the laws 
of literary unity, coherence, and emphasis. What 
the workman needs is a design which he can follow 
until he has learned the use and proper relation to 
each other of the necessary members or features of 
all architecture, the arch, pier, roof, wall, buttress, 
and apertures. Only after he has seen these ele- 
ments in carefully organized structures is he capable 
of making intelligent designs of his own. The in- 
experienced writer, too, needs more help than the 
text-books give him in the organization of his ma- 
terial according to long-accepted general designs 
which we can find by the analysis of pieces of litera- 
ture. We feel that the next step in the development 
of a distinct pedagogy for English teaching must be 
an attempt to solve this problem of organization. 
We have new material, but no new method for 
either literary analysis or synthesis.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



MR. JE5SSUP AS A CRITIC OF MR. FREDERIC 

HARRISON. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

That a first-hand critic may occasionally " change his 
pace " in the logical sequence of an argument is not at 
all times greatly to be marvelled at. But when a 
second-hand critic, endeavoring to expose in the un- 
broken tracks of his forerunner the existence of such 
change of pace, stumbles and falls headlong, obliter- 
ating both his own prints and those of the innocent first- 
hand critic, and scattering dust into the eyes of his 
knowledge-seeking audience, in what degree shall we 
marvel? 

In the last issue of The Dial, Mr. Alexander Jessup 
criticises Mr. Frederic Harrison's masterly estimate of 
Tennyson. And why? Because Mr. Harrison in his 
criticism of " In Memoriam " advances among the cons 
that: " With all its art, melody, and charm, we see 
from time to time in • In Memoriam ' a little too visibly 
the « sad mechanic exercise ' which is the inevitable re- 
sult of too rigid and prolonged devotion to the uses of 
* measured language.' " And, a little farther on in the 
same essay, Mr. Harrison speaks of Tennyson's '« relig- 
ious and philosophical pieces (especially ' In Memoriam,' 
the most perfect of his poems), because his claim to 
rank as the supreme poet of the nineteenth century must 
rest on this if on anything "; while a little farther on still 
Mr. Harrison continues: «* It is a far happier task to 
turn to the more distinctly lyrical work of Tennyson — 
that whereon his permanent fame must abide." 

The italics in both cases are Mr. Jessup's; and he 
italicizes because it seems to him that though "most 
admirers of Tennyson will agree with Mr. Harrison in 
his latter statement, ... it is hard for them to under- 
stand his (Mr. Harrison's) singular disagreement with 
himself"; and (to draw towards a close with Mr. Jes- 
sup's «« pique ") though " In two different books, or even 
in two different essays in the same book, such contra- 
dictions of view might be excused on the ground of 
changed views, ... in the same essay they cannot be 
allowed to pass unchallenged, — especially as Mr. Har- 
rison's Tennyson • estimate ' is full of ' this sort of 
thing.'" 

Is further exposition necessary to reveal the hoUow- 
ness of such arguments against Mr. Harrison's excel- 
lent criticism — a criticism which only misses the quali- 
fication "unequalled" because its entire dimensions — 
depth, breadth, height, — and its learned soundness, are 
almost consistently the characteristic of Mr. Frederic 
Harrison's critical work? 

However, if only for the benefit of Mr. Jessup himself, 
let me put the " vexed " question in its plainest form: 

1. " lu Memoriam " is the most perfect of Tennyson's 
poems, though it has its weaknesses; as a philosophical 
poem it strikes the key-note of nineteenth century 
thought, and in so doing it places itself in the balance 
against every circa-eonteraporary work sharing that 
characteristic; if, ipso facto, " In Memoriam " turns the 
scales, Tennyson is the poet who, as the prophet of his 
"day," may "claim to rank as the supreme poet of the 
nineteenth century." 

2. And there is also to be weighed, quite independ- 
ently, the lyrical works of the poet — work whose tune 
is in harmony with the song of all time — not merely 
with the current fugue of an epoch, — of a day. Herein 



is the immortality of the poet Tennyson proven; for it 
is to these pieces that Mr. Harrison declares " it is a 
far happier task to turn " — the work " whereon his 
permanent fame must abide." In short, not only is 
Tennyson possibly the first poet of his century, but he 
is a poet of all time. 

Mr. Jessup concludes: " With such futilities as these 
does Mr. Harrison regale us in his essay on Tennyson. 
Such captious dissections and philological peckings are 
but the tin-soldiery of literary criticism. . . . Mr. 
Frederic Harrison can write good criticism and he does 
write it elsewhere in this volume; but the essay on 
Tennyson is * of little worth.' " 

The fact is at all events patent to any logical reader 
that if such bottomless cavillings are the gist of Mr. 
Jessup's objections to the " Criticism on Tennyson," 
they, indeed, are objections " of little worth " — are the 
very tin hobby-horses of second-hand criticism.

NOTES FROM JAPAN. 
( To the Editor of Thk Dl/u,.) 

The number of Japanese honored with the degree of 
LL.D. from Occidental universities is increasing. A 
year ago Baron Kaneko, who had received LL.B. from 
Harvard University in the 80's, was honored with 
LL.D. by his alma mater. Recently Glasgow Uni- 
versity conferred the same degree on Prof. J. Sakurni, 
of the Imperial University, Tokyo, — the first instance 
in the case of a British institution. Yale University is 
to confer the same degree on Hon. K. Hatoyama, one 
of her own sons; and is reported to have offered the 
degree also to Hon. Mr. Kiknchi, Minister of Ekiuca- 
tion, and to Marquis Ito. These honors are worthily 
bestowed on able and scholarly men. 

The scholars of Japan are naturally proud of the 
fact, that, by the generosity of Baron Iwosaki, the Max 
Miiller Library has been purchased for the Imperial 
University in "rokyo, in accordance with the wishes of 
the late owner, and is expected to arrive soon. 

The Foreign Language School, Tokyo, continues to 
grow in favor and influence. At its recent graduation 
ceremony, ninety-two students were gfiven certificates, 
of which the largest number were for courses in Chi- 
nese, English, German, French, and Russian. 

A history of English literature, written in a most 
entertaining way by Dr. Tsubouchi, is meeting with 
great favor. One paper says: "Next to Chinese lit- 
erature in the influence it has had on our national life 
stands English literature." 

A recent issue of the "Japan Mail" has the follow- 
ing item: " Baron Takasaki, Chief of the Poets' Bureau 
in the Palace, says that the Emperor's love of poetry 
increases with years. Scarcely an evening passes that 
His Majesty does not compose from 27 to 30 of the 
thirty-one-syllabled couplets called Wa-ka. These are 
handed to Baron Takasaki for examination. Baron 
Takasaki has held his present position since 1892, and 
he declares that the number of couplets composed by 
His Majesty from that time up to the end of last 
March was thirty-seven thousand. The Empress also 
is very fond of writing verses, but Her Majesty's pen 
is not so prolific as that of the Emperor. She com- 
poses about two couplets twice a week — quite enough 
for any ordinary mortal, we venture to think."

"B. li. 8."* 



The task of preparing and presenting to an 
eager world an adequate life of Robert Louis 
Stevenson may well have seemed a formidable 
one, especially after the two volumes of " Let- 
ters " 80 admirably edited by Mr. Sidney Colvin ; 
and the public regret at Mr. Colvin's inability 
to write the promised biography has naturally 
been accompanied by some uncertainty as to 
the qualifications of Mr. Graham Balfour, who 
was requested to undertake the work. Mr. 
Colvin was for many years Stevenson's most 
intimate literary friend ; Mr. Balfour was heard 
of chiefly as one of Stevenson's fifty-odd first 
cousins. But Mr. Colvin saw his friend for 
the last time in 1887, when he bade him good- 
bye at the ship's side in London. Mr. Balfour 
resided as a member of the family at Vailima 
during the last two and a half years of his 
cousin's life, and was admitted to an intimacy 
shared only by the immediate members of the 
household. His acquaintance with every de- 
tail of the family history, remote or recent, 
seems both extensive and exact. His oppor- 
tunities, therefore, were unique ; and it may be 
said at once that he has not been unequal to 
them. To complain that the "Life" is less 
inspiring than the " Letters " — in other words, 
that Mr. Balfour is not Stevenson — is a criti- 
cism which should quickly be disarmed by the 
author's modest and candid words in the preface. 
" In Stevenson's case, if anywhere, the rule holds, 
that all biography should be autobiography if it could ; 
and I have availed myself as far as possible of the 
writings in which he has referred to himself and his past 
experience. To bring together the passing allusions to 
himself scattered widely throughout his works, was an 
obvious duty; at the same time my longer quotations, 
except in two or three manifest and necessary instances, 
have been taken almost entirely from the material 
which was hitherto either unpublished or issued only in 
the limited Edinburgh edition." 

On this plan Mr. Balfour has written a nar- 
rative not unlike Hallam Tennyson's Life of 
his father ; and these two volumes may with 
propriety take their place on the shelf next to 
the " Letters " and the best editions of the 
" Collected Works." 

Stevenson's ancestors, through several gen- 
erations on the father's side, were engineers to 
the Board of Northern Lights ; his grandfather, 

♦The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson. By Graham 
Balfour. In two volumes. With portraits. New York: 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 



Robert Stevenson, in 1807 "began his great 
work at the Bell Rock, the first lighthouse 
ever erected far from land upon a reef deeply 
submerged at every tide." 

" Sir Walter Scott accompanied the Commissioners 
and their officer on one of the annual voyages of the 
Pharos (the board's official steamer) ; his Journal, pub- 
lished by Lockbart, shows that he found Robert Steven- 
son an appreciative and intelligent companion. The 
Pirate and The Lord of the Isles were the direct result 
of this cruise." 

A great engineer and man of action, Robert 
Stevenson also essayed writing, and his " Ac- 
count of the Bell Rock Lighthouse " has been 
happily described as the " romance of stone 
and lime," and the " Robinson Crusoe of en- 
gineering." Mr. Balfour adds : 

"Traits are obliterated, and the characteristics of a 
family may change, but the old man's detestation of 
everything slovenly or dishonest, ' his interest in the 
whole page of Experience, and his perpetual quest and 
fine scent for all that seems romantic to a boy, ' were 
handed dowu, if ever taste was transmitted, to his 
grandson. Of the one as of the other it will have been 
said that ' Perfection was his design. ' " 

The other grandfather was the Rev. Lewis 
Balfour, D.D., minister of Colinton, a parish 
about five miles from Edinburgh. In " Mem- 
ories and Portraits " he is described as follows : 

" A man of singular simplicity of nature ; unemotional, 
and hating the display of what he felt ; standing con- 
tented on the old ways. . . . When not abroad, he 
sat much alone, writing sermons or letters to his scattered 
family in a dark and cold room with a library of bloodless 
books — and these lonely hours wrapped him in the 
greater gloom for our imaginations." 

But his heart warmed to the sprightly delicate 
little "Smoutie," his grandson, when the boy 
came in to recite a psalm. " He took me in 
his arms, with most unwonted tenderness, and 
kissed me, and gave me a little kindly sermon 
for my psalm : so that for that day, we were 
clerk and parson." " Try as I will," Stevenson 
later wrote, "I cannot join myself on with the 
reverend doctor ; and all the while, no doubt, 
and even as I write the phrase, he moves in 
my blood and whispers words to me, and sits 
efficient in the very knot and centre of my 
being. " 

Such, and much besides, were his grand- 
fathers. Of his father, Thomas Stevenson, his 
inspired pen has left us many a vivid portraiture ; 
none, possibly, of bolder outline than this, from 
" Memories and Portraits ": 

" He was a man of a somewhat antique strain ; with 
a blended sternness and softness that was wholly Scottish, 
and at first somewhat bewildering ; with a profound 
essential melancholy of disposition and (what often 
accompanies it) the most humorous geniality in com-

pany ; shrewd and childish ; passionately attached and 
passionately prejudiced ; a man of many extremes, 
many faults of temper, and no very stable foothold for 
himself among life's troubles. . . . His talk, compounded 
of so much sterling sense and so much freakish humor, 
and clothed in language so apt, droll, and emphatic, 
was a perpetual delight to all who knew him." 

We are not surprised when Mr. Balfour says 
that " the characteristics of the father in his 
boyhood might be ascribed with little alteration 
to the son. The circumstances differed, but 
the spirits, the freaks, and the idleness were 
the same. " Of their relations to each other 
he adds : 

" Thomas Stevenson's entire life was devoted to the 
unremitting pursuit of a scientific profession in which 
it was his dearest wish to see his son following in his 
footsteps. Yet it was from him that Louis derived 
all the romantic and artistic elements that drew him 
away from engineering, and were the chief means by 
which he became an acknowledged master of his art. 

" The differences between the pair were slight, the 
points of resemblance many. The younger man devoted 
his life to art, and not to science, and the bold of dogma 
upon him was early relaxed. But the humor and the 
melancholy, the sternness and the softness, the attach- 
ments and the prejudices, the chivalry, the generosity, 
the Celtic temperament, and the sensitive conscience 
passed direct from father to son in proportions but 
slightly varied, and to some who knew them both well, 
the father was the more remarkable of the two. One 
period of misunderstanding they had, but it was brief, 
and might have been avoided had either of the pair been 
less sincere or less in earnest. Afterward, and perhaps 
as a consequence, their comprehension and appreciation 
of each other grew complete, and their attachment was 
even deeper than that usually subsisting between father 
and only son." 

Stevenson left no sketch of his mother, a fact 
easily understood when it is remembered that 
she outlived him. Mr. Balfour supplies this 
deficiency with a description from which we 
can make only the briefest extract. 

"In person she was tall, slender, and graceful; and 
her face and complexion retained their beauty, as her 
figure and walk preserved their elasticity, to the last. 
Her vivacity and brightness were most attractive. . . . 
Her undaunted spirit led her when nearly sixty to ac- 
company her son first to America, and then, in a racing 
schooner, through the remotest groups of the Pacific, 
finally to settle with him in the undisturbed spot where 
he had chosen his home." 

And what a stimulus to his spiritual qualities 
must have been afforded by the society and 
conversation of his best-loved cousin, Robert 
Alan Mowbray Stevenson, — the " Bob " so 
affectionately commemorated in " Memories and 
Portraits." 

" He was the most valuable man to talk to, above 
all, in his younger days; for he twisted like a serpent, 
changed like the patterns in a kaleidoscope, transmi- 
grated (it is the only word) from one point of view to 
another with a swiftness and completeness that left a 



stupid and merely logical mind panting in the rear; and 
so, in an incredibly brief space of time helped you to view 
a question upon every side. In sheer trenchancy of mind 
I have ever been his humble and distant follower." 

These are but glances at a few of the people 
who surrounded and, so far as in them lay, 
affected the childhood of Robert Louis Steven- 
son. He was always " being a boy ": in a 
special sense he may be called the sacer votes 
of childhood. Few writers have retained such 
continuous impressions of childhood's dreams 
and realizations ; none, surely, has voiced them 
more truthfully. The delights of boyish " make- 
believe " received their crown for young Louis 
and his associates in the " lantern-bearers," a 
sport whose description it were almost profane 
to abridge. 

" Toward the end of September, when school-time 
was drawing near and the nights were already black, 
we would begin to sally from our respective villas, each 
equipped with a tin bull's-eye lantern. The thing was 
so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce 
of Great Britain; and the grocers, about the due time, 
began to garnish their windows with our particular 
brand of luminary. We wore them buckled to the 
waist upon a cricket belt, and over them, such was the 
rigour of the game, a buttoned top-coat. They smelled 
noisomely of blistered tin; they never burned aright, 
though they were always burning our fingers; their use 
was naught; the pleasure of them merely fanciful; and 
yet a boy with a bull's-eye under his coat asked for 
nothing more. . . . When two of these asses met, there 
would be an anxious < Have you got your lantern? ' and 
a gratified • Yes.' That was the shibboleth, and very 
needful, too; for as it was the rule to keep our glory 
contained, none could recognize a lantern-bearer, unless 
(like a polecat) by the smell. Four or five would some- 
times climb into the beUy of a ten-man lugger, with 
nothing but the thwarts above them — for the cabin was 
usually locked — or choose out some hollow of the links 
where the wind might whistle overhead. There the 
coats would be unbuttoned and the bull's-eyes discov- 
ered; and in the chequering glimmer, under the huge 
windy hall of the night, and cheered by a rich steam of 
toasting tinware, these fortunate young gentlemen 
would crouch together in the cold sand of the links or 
on the scaly bilges of the fishing-boat, and delight 
themselves with inappropriate talk. 

" Woe is me that I may not give some specimens — 
some of their foresights of life, or deep inquiries into 
the rudiments of man and nature — these were so fiery 
and so innocent, they were so richly silly, so romantic- 
ally young. But the talk, at any rate, was but a condi- 
ment; and these gatherings themselves only accidents 
in the career of the lantern-bearer. The essence of this 
bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night; the 
slide shut, the top-coat buttoned; not a ray escaping, 
whether to conduct your footsteps, or to make your 
glory public : a mere pillar of darkness in the dark ; and 
all the while, deep down in the privacy of your fool's 
heart, to know you had a bull's-eye at your belt, and to 
exult and sing over the knowledge." 

Stevenson had but scattered schooling, and 
his college life at the University of Edinburgh

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



(1867-70) was fruitful chiefly in giving to 
him an intimate knowledge of the highways 
and byways of Auld Reekie, and in demon- 
strating conclusively that he would never make 
an engineer, the profession for which he was 
■of course intended. As far as the University 
was concerned, he " acted upon an extensive 
and highly rational system of truantry, which 
cost him a great deal of trouble to put in 
exercise." His studies were thus mainly in 
the book of life : not unfruitful, as his readers 
well know. Perhaps the two most notable 
things of those academic days were his mem- 
bership in the Speculative Society of the Uni- 
versity — " that ' Spec ' of which the fame has 
gone abroad in the world largely by means of 
his writings," — and his coming under the whole- 
some influence of Professor Fleeming Jenkin 
and his charming wife; together with other such 
friendships, as those with Charles Baxter, James 
Walter Ferrier, and Sir Walter Simpson. 
Somewhat later, in an English visit, he met Sid- 
ney Colvin and Mrs. Sitwell, whose correspond- 
ence with Stevenson is so richly informing. 

In one of his morbid moods, now growing 
happily rarer, he had written down the chief 
desires of his heart. " First, good health ; 
secondly, a small competence ; and thirdly, O 
du lieber GottI friends." The second and 
third of these petitions were surely answered : 
but the first — I Was ever man of genius so 
ruthlessly handicapped? Almost from the 
cradle the pitiful record of the struggle begins ; 
every ugly form of pulmonary disease wreaked 
itself in experiment upon his corpus vile : pleu- 
risy, congestion, pneumonia, hemorrhages, — 
these were their household words where the 
rest of the world speaks of malaria, indigestion, 
or headache. In 1893 he wrote to Mr. George 
Meredith : 

"For fourteen years I have not had a day's real 
health: I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary; 
and I have done my work unflinchingly. I have writ- 
ten in bed, and written out of it, written in hemorrhages, 
written in sickness, written torn by coughing, written 
when my head swam for weakness. And the battle 
goes on — ill or well, is a trifle; so as it goes. I was 
made for a contest, and the Powers have so willed that 
my battlefield should be this dingy, inglorious one of 
the bed and the physic bottle." 

Of the magnificent heroism and sunny sweet- 
ness with which he endured all this, we 
must learn from these volumes of Mr. Bal- 
four ; for the " Letters " and other writings 
allow us only to guess at them. The pathetic 
record is full of reproach to common comfort- 
able existences, but has its inspiration for all 



who have ears to hear. We need feel no 
shame for the tears which start as we read 
such an instance as this, taken from the account 
of their sojourn on the Riviera in 1883-1884, 
when Stevenson was attacked with the most 
violent and dangerous hemorrhage of his life : 

" The dust of street refuse gave him Egyptian 
ophthalmia, and sciatica descending upon him caused 
him the more pain, as he was suffering already from 
restlessness. The hemorrhage was not yet healed, and 
we now hear for the first time of the injunctions to ab- 
solute silence, orders patiently obeyed, distasteful as 
they were. In silence and the dark, and in acute suf- 
fering, he was still cheery and undaunted. When the 
ophthalmia began and the doctor first announced his 
diagnosis, Mrs. Stevenson felt that it was more than any 
one could be expected to bear, and went into another 
room, and there, in her own phrase, ' sat and gloomed.' 
Louis rang his bell, and she went to him, saying, in the 
bitterness of her spirit, as she entered the room, ' Well, 
I suppose that this is the very best thing that could 
have happened!' 'Why, how odd!' wrote Louis on a 
piece of paper, 'I was just going to say those very 
words.' " 

It was on his visit to London in 1873 that 
Stevenson was "ordered South" by Sir An- 
drew Clark, and went for the winter to Men- 
tone. This was the first of those extended 
quests which were to make him an exile from 
England for practically the rest of his life, 
though he often came back and attempted to 
stay at home. " I do not ask for health," he 
once said, " but I will go anywhere and live in 
any place where I can enjoy the ordinary ex- 
istence of a human being." One after another 
they were all tried: Mentone, Davos, H^eres, 
Bournemouth ; then, with lengthening range, 
the Adirondacks, California, and finally those 
" Ultimate Islands " where he found alleviation, 
delights, a quiet home, and a mountain grave. 
His life was undoubtedly blessed and prob- 
ably lengthened by the companionship and 
devoted care of the interesting woman whom 
he met and loved in France, followed to America, 
and there married in 1880. Mrs. Osbourne's 
first marriage had been unhappy ; but her union 
with Stevenson was a source of happiness to 
both, and her two clever and affectionate chil- 
dren found in their stepfather a delightful friend 
and guide. 

Mr. Balfour's second volume describes the 
three years of life at Bournemouth, 1884-1887; 
then the winter spent at Saranac Lake in the 
Adirondacks, with the details of which Ameri- 
can readers of the " Letters " are familiar ; and 
then come the chapters devoted to those pro- 
longed and romantic cruises in the Pacific 
which meant so much to Stevenson's body and 
soul. The " Casco," a topsail schooner, ninety-

five feet in length, of seventy tons burden, was 
chartered at San Francisco ; the captain, the 
cook, and a crew of four deck-hands, formed her 
complement ; and the passenger-list included 
Stevenson, his wife, his mother, and his step-son. 

"At last, on June 26th, 1888, the party took up 
their quarters on the ' Casco,' and at the dawn of the 
28th she was towed outside the Golden Gate, and beaded 
for the south across the long swell of the Pacific. So 
with his household he sailed away beyond the sunset, 
and America, like Europe, was to see him no more." 

From the published chapters " In the South 
Seas " Mr. Balfour makes but sparing excerpts, 
relying rather on Stevenson's original rough 
journal at the time, as striking a more personal 
note and dealing to a greater extent with his 
individual experience. The first voyage carried 
them to the Marquesas Islands after a run of 
twenty-two days. His reception there was 
cordial, and his vivid impressions of this French 
possession so recently redeemed from cannibal- 
ism are for the most part recorded in his 
published works. But we have from his note- 
book a charming picture of the good French 
missionary Pere Simeon. 

" The small frail figure in the black robe, drawing 
near under the palms ; the girlish, kind and somewhat 
pretty face under the straw hat ; the strong Gascon 
accent ; the sudden lively doCBog of the hat, at once so 
French and so ecclesiastical ; he was a man you could not 
look upon without visions of his peasant ancestors, 
worthy folk, sitting at home today in France, and re- 
joiced (I hope often) with letters from their boy. 

" Pfere Simeon admired these natives as I do myself, 
admired them with spiritual envy ; the superior of his 
congregation had said to him on his departure ' Yon 
are going among a people more civilized than we — 
peut-etre plus civilises que nous-memes.' What then 
was P^re Simeon doing here ? The question rose in 
my mind, and I could see that he read the thought. 
Truly they were a people, on the whole, of a mind far 
liker Christ than any of the races of Europe : no 
spiritual life, almost no family life, but a kindness, a 
generosity, a readiness to give and to forgive, without 
parallel ; to some extent that was the bishop's doing ; 
some of it had been since undone ; death runs so busy 
in their midst, total extinction so instantly impended, 
that it seemed a hopeless task to combat their vices ; 
as they were, they would go down in the abyss of things 
past ; the watchers were already looking at the clock ; 
Pfere Simeon's business was the visitation of the sick, 
to smooth the pillows of this dying family of man." 

We cannot follow the detailed itinerary of 
these floatings through the " summer isles of 
Eden, lying in dark purple spheres of sea." 
Seen by such eyes and reported by such a pen, 
they have yielded to us all no small part of 
their magical charm. From one group to an- 
other the little party wove their way until the 
last thread was drawn ashore at Apia, there to 
await the shears of Atropos. 



Of the last years at Yaillma Mr. Balfour 
writes with considerable fulness, having been 
a resident of the place along with the family, 
though not there when the end came so 
suddenly on the 3d of December, 1894. The 
touching and romantic circumstances of the 
burial of Tusitala are known to all the world ; 
and Mr. Balfour simply repeats Mr. Osboume's 
admirable account from the " Letters." He 
allows himself, however, a chapter (headed 
with the simple initials " R. L. S.") of appre- 
ciation of the genius and character of Steven- 
son, which is so admirably conceived and so 
temperately and tenderly expressed, that few 
readers will fail to return to it a second and a 
third time. Quotation in this case is almost 
mutilation, but here are one or two of the 
closing paragraphs : 

" There was this about him, that he was the only man 
I have ever known who possessed charm in a high de- 
gree whose character did not suffer from the possession. 
The gift comes naturally to women, and they are at 
their best in its exercise. But a man requires to be of 
a very sound fibre before he can be entirely himself and 
keep his heart single, if he carries about with him a 
talisman to obtain from all men and all women the ob- 
ject of his heart's desire. Both g^fts Stevenson pos- 
sessed, not only the magic but also the strength of char- 
acter to which it was safely entrusted. 

" There linger on the lips of men a few names that 
bring to us, as it were, a breeze blowing off the shores 
of youth. Most of those who have borne them were 
taken from the world before early promise could be 
fulfilled, and so they rank in our regard by virtue of 
their possibilities alone. Stevenson is among the fewer 
men who bear the award both of promise and of achieve- 
ment, and is happier yet in this: besides admiration and 
hope he has raised within the hearts of his readers a 
personal feeling towards himself which is nothing less 
deep than love." 

The publishers have given Mr. Balfour's 
volumes a handsome setting. There is a good 
index ; and seven appendices, containing ad- 
dresses of Stevenson on education and missions, 
a list of the beautiful Vailima Prayers, four 
drafts of the opening chapter of " Weir of Her- 
miston " to illustrate the author's patient pains 
in composition, a complete chronological bibli- 
ography of his works, and a curious dozen of 
samples, nine from Stevenson and three from 
his "originals," showing his power of using 
other men's style at will while forming his own. 
Students can exercise their ingenuity in " plac- 
ing " these specimens, some of which are, in- 
deed, unmistakable. 

Besides the portraits of Stevenson and Mrs. 
Stevenson, there is an interesting chart of the 
Pacific voyages, oddly added to the first vol- 
ume, while describing events of the second.

The Origin or European Peoples.* 



The author of " The Mediterranean Race " 
is Professor of Anthropology in the University 
of Rome. He is one of the foremost workers 
in Anthropology and is notably bold and in- 
dependent in thought. He fearlessly criticizes 
those anthropological methods which he believes 
to be imperfect, and insists upon new ones, 
which he believes to be better. Anthropolog- 
ists in general give much weight to the Cephalic 
index — or the proportion between the length 
and breadth of the skull. Sergi insists that it 
has but little value, that the same cephalic 
index may be given by skulls which differ pro- 
foundly in character. He himself says : 

" According to my method of cranial forms, it is the 
forms alone that we have to take into consideration, 
and I have shown that the same cranial form may vary 
in measurements and in index without losing its char- 
acters; this is a natural method, such as is employed 
in zoology. How many species of lark we should have 
if we calculated hy measurement their indices of length 
and breadth ! " 

We shall gain the clearest idea of the author's 
treatment by stating nine propositions, which 
he formulates : 

" 1. The primitive populations of Europe, after Homo 
Neanderthalensis, originated in Africa; these constituted 
the entire population of neolithic times. 

"2. The basin of the Mediterranean was the chief 
centre of movement whence the African migrations 
reached the centre and the north of Europe. 

" 3 From the great African stock were formed three 
varieties . . .; one peculiarly African . . .; another, 
the Mediterranean . . .; and a third the Nordic. . . . 
These three varieties are the three great branches of 
one species, which I call Eurafrican, because it occupied, 
and still occupies, a large portion of the two continents 
of Africa and Europe. 

"4. These three human varieties have nothing in 
cemmon with the so-called Aryan races; . . . the Ger- 
mans and Scandinavians are Eurafricans 

of the Nordic variety. 

" 5. The Aryans are of Asiatic origin, and constitute a 
variety of the Eurasiatic speciesj the physical characters 
of their skeletons are different from those of the Eur- 
africans. 

"6. The primitive civilization of the Eurafricans 
is Afro- Mediterranean, becoming eventually Afro- 
European. 

" 7. The Mycenaean civilization had its origin in 
Asia, and was transformed by diffusion in the Medi- 
terranean. 

"8. The two classic civilizations, Greek and Latin, 
were not Aryan, but Mediterranean . . . 

"9. In the course of the Aryan invasion the lan- 
guages of the Eurafrican species in Europe were trans- 
formed in Italy, Greece, and elsewhere, Celtic, German, 
Slavonic, etc., being genuine branches of the Aryan 
tongue; iu other cases the Aryan languages underwent

a transformation, preserving some elements of the 
conquered tongues, as in the Neo-Celtic of Wales." 

To the reader who has not followed the re- 
cent periodical literature of anthropology, these 
propositions may come as a distinct shock. 
They upset some of the cherished dogmas of 
linguistic and anthropological science. Sergi 
proceeds to develope and sustain them in a 
brilliant way. He first presents an historical 
sketch of the phases of Indo-Germanism. Next, 
he presents a detailed study of the Mediter- 
ranean Race. The Hamitic peoples of North- 
ern Africa — the Libyans, Egyptians, Western 
Libyans, and the population of the Canary 
Islands, are referred to this race, and are stated 
to differ only as local varieties of one great 
type. The peoples of Syria and Asia Minor, 
past and present, are examined and referred to 
the same race. The Iberians, Pelasgians, 
Etruscans, and Ligurians are South Euro- 
peans, of the Mediterranean Race, who have 
migrated by various routes from the old African 
home. The extension of the race northward is 
claimed upon British, French, Swiss, German, 
Bohemian, Scandinavian, and Russian evi- 
dence. The light doliehocephals (long-heads) 
of the north are only locally-modified dark 
doliehocephals from the south. Sergi holds 
that the diffusion of the Mediterranean Race 
was interrupted by the immigration, from 
Asia, of the Eurasian Aryans, who in physical 
type, in language, and in culture, were unlike 
the Eurafricans. They were inferior in culture 
to the older population of Europe, but were, 
apparently, more vigorous and aggressive. The 
whole argument is fundamentally anthropo- 
logical, based upon skull-form, but much and 
able use is made of archaeological and other 
evidence. 

In the presence of this brilliant presentation 
we naturally ask whether it can be harmonized 
with the teachings of others regarding Euro- 
pean ethnology. Three good general discus- 
sions of this field have been lately published 
— Keane's, Ripley's, and Deniker's. Keane 
has been much influenced by Sergi and by 
Ripley. For him there are three European 
races — Homoeuropaeus, Homo alpinus, Homo 
mediterranensis. The first and third of these 
correspond to Sergi's two divisions of the 
Mediterranean Race ; the second to Sergi's 
Eurasians. But Keane considers the northern 
H. europaeus to be Asiatic and Aryan and 
the H. alpinus to be Asiatic and, probably, 
non-Aryan. He recognizes Africa as the 
oriffinal home of H. mediterranensis. He also

THE DIAL. 



361 



believes that an early short-headed (brachy- 
cephalic) population entered Europe from the 
south. 

Ripley recognizes three European races — 
Teutonic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. So far 
as regards the Mediterranean Race proper he 
would probably agree with Sergi. As regards 
the Asiatic origin of his Alpine (brachyceph- 
alic — short- headed) Race he would also agree 
with Sergi, but probably does not consider 
them Aryans. Regarding the origin of the 
Teutonic Race he is somewhat reserved. 

Deniker recognizes ten races and sub-races 
in Europe. He characterizes them carefully, 
employing stature, complexion, hair, cephalic 
index, nose form, etc., as his basis of classifi- 
cation. He presents the synonymy of his ten 
race-types with care, but we can hardly present 
or discuss it here. For Sergi, Deniker's ten 
types would be so many local varieties or sub- 
varieties of his two species — Eurafrican and 
Eurasian. 

It will be seen that Sergi's book has great 
importance. Some of his views, which, when 
he first proposed them, were ridiculed, have 
already gained acceptance. Whether all his 
views will eventually be accepted or not, he 
deserves a respectful hearing.

Cromwell, as a Military Tyrant.* 



The appearance of the third volume of Mr. 
Gardiner's " History of the Commonwealth 
and Protectorate," so soon after the publica- 
tion of the second volume (1897), gives new 
foundation for the hope that the author may 
live to complete the monumental work to which 
he has devoted his life. The present volume 
shows no falling off from that high standard 
of workmanship which long experience has 
taught Mr. Gardiner's readers to expect from 
his hands, — unless possibly (one hardly more 
than imagines it) in some slight traces of hur- 
ried composition. As for the rest, there is the 
same masterly handling of material, the same 
keen insight into the motives of men, the same 
cool unbiassed judgment and unflinching cour- 
age in presenting results. 

The period treated is that of the two years 
which followed the assembling of the first Pro-

tectorate Parliament ; i. e., from 1654 to 1656. 
It includes the incidents in Cromwell's career 
which are the most di£Bcult for his admirers 
to explain consistently with the idealizations of 
the cult of nineteenth century hero-worshipers. 
It goes without saying that Mr. Gardiner has 
no theory to establish, and that he strives 
simply to set forth the facts with that absolute 
integrity which has given him his high rank, 
not only among the historians of this age, but of 
all time. In fact, after one has read this volume, 
the conviction is strengthened that Cromwell 
can never be understood, much less dealt with 
justly, if he is to be held up to latter-day stand- 
ards or be pedestaled by the side of latter-day 
heroes. His motives, his ideals, were of the 
seventeenth century, and of the early seven- 
teenth century at that. With these motives he 
was consistent ; to these ideals he was true ; 
but neither men nor motives nor ideals can 
have place in this age of political and religions 
light. Cromwell was called to the government 
of the three kingdoms at a time when the fires of 
the Thirty Years' War were still smouldering, 
when its grim traditions were still fresh upon 
men's minds, and the renewal of the struggle 
between Protestant Europe and Catholic 
Europe, as statesmen regarded things then, 
was one of the possibilities of the immediate 
future. Only so can we understand the utter 
obtuseness of the Protector to the actual con- 
ditions which confronted Europe in 1654, and 
his failure to grasp the fact that the old motives 
which had determined the friendships and the 
animosities of the era of religious wars were 
passing away, and that a new series of motives, 
born not of religious traditions but of commer- 
cial hopes and ambitions, had taken possession 
of the statesmen of Europe and were to dic- 
tate the alliances and counter-alliances of the 
future. Cromwell was not without glimpses of 
the new day at hand ; but his mind was still 
darkened by the shadows of the night which 
was passing away. Hence he moved with un- 
certain step ; was frequently inconsistent with 
his own avowed purpose ; and, to the worldly- 
wise statesmen of the Continent, at times ap- 
parently " infamously hypocritical." He failed 
to discern the threat of future commercial and 
colonial rivalry that lay in the upbuilding of 
Holland and France, and wasted his time in 
striving to draw the Protestant powers of Europe 
into an offensive alliance against the Catholic 
powers. As the immediate future was to reveal, 
the real menace to England was not to come 
from poor old bankrupt Spain, or the sorely-

crippled German branch of the House of Aus- 
tria, but first from the waxing commercial power 
of Holland, and second from the waxing political 
ambitions of France. 

Mr. Gardiner does not try to apologize for 
this serious error in Cromwell's foreign policy. 
He simply sets forth the facts, leaving them to 
present to the reader the real Cromwell, — not 
the far-seeing statesman, the wise diplomat, the 
founder of British foreign policy, but a blun- 
dering soldier, thoroughly honest at heart, who 
by the accident of revolution had been put in 
charge of the delicate machinery of diplomacy 
— a machinery far too delicate for the rough 
hand of the swordsman. Hence, the great 
Oliver hardly appears here to advantage. In 
his negotiations with Charles X. he is a well- 
meaning visionary, devoted to ideals which the 
world has outgrown, and without even the nov- 
ice's knowledge of the simplest elements of Con- 
tinental politics. In his dealing with Spain, he 
is saved from the charge of most reprehen- 
sible treachery only by the plea that he did not 
know that his unprovoked attack upon San 
Domingo and Jamaica was an act of war. 
These are hard things for the admirers of 
Oliver's statesmanship to accept ; but their 
quarrel is not with Mr. Gardiner, but with the 
array of evidence which is here marshaled with 
the pitilessness of an indictment. 

Little, also, can be said in defence of the 
Protector's cold-blooded plan of removing 
"Papists and other superfluous Irish" from the 
more fertile, and hence more valuable, parts 
of Ireland to the uncultivated, unattractive re- 
gions of the west and south, in order to make 
room for a permanent settlement of his Protest- 
ant soldiers. It may be that Cromwell would 
" meddle with no man's conscience," as he wrote 
to the governor of New Ross in 1649 ; yet evi- 
dently in his scheme of toleration he had no 
place for the Mass. The Catholic religion in 
Ireland was to be virtually proscribed ; the 
priests were to be persecuted, and the estates of 
their supporters confiscated to the advantage of 
the Cromwellian soldiery and the " Adventur- 
ers." Out of a total population of less than 
one million souls, according to Mr. Gardiner's 
estimate, fully one hundred thousand were 
marked for hanging or for deportation to the 
West Indian plantations. The animus which 
could conceive of such a wholesale attainder of 
an entire people can be explained only by Crom- 
well's ignorance of the conditions which existed 
in Ireland, and by the fact that he imagined 
himself still fighting out the issues which had 



made the recently closed religious wars of 
Europe possible. The most that can be offered 
in his defense is that the orders were never 
carried out. Comparatively few people were 
deported, fewer still were hanged, and the new 
plantation of Ireland was only feebly under- 
taken. For this, however, the Protector de- 
serves little credit. He had really set his heart 
on " the great work," and yielded at last only 
because his subordinates — chiefly his own 
son Henry — to whom he had entrusted the 
conduct of affairs in Ireland, shrank from 
firing up any such devil's caldron as the Pro- 
tector's plans would have provided for his 
lieutenants. 

It is easier to understand, possibly even to 
justify, Cromwell's conduct of domestic affairs 
during these years. Ostensibly, a constitu- 
tional government had been established, con- 
sisting of a sort of strictly limited monarchy 
and a strictly limited parliament, mutually de- 
pendent on each other, and in such a way as to 
prevent either party from becoming supreme. In 
reality, however, in giving the Protector entire 
control over the army, and in forbidding the 
parliament to reduce its size without the Pro- 
tector's consent, the new constitution had 
entirely nullified any independent authority 
which it might seem to confer upon the par- 
liament, and had reduced any opposition which 
parliament might see fit to offer, to the nature 
of advice or at least a protest. 

The issue was what might have been ex- 
pected. The first Protectorate parliament had 
no sooner come together than it proceeded at 
once to strike at the foundation of the Protec- 
tor's power, by seeking to amend the Instru- 
ment of Government under which he and they 
exercised their authority, and finally denied 
the coordinate authority of the Protector alto- 
gether. After five lunar months were passed 
in useless wrangling, Cromwell, taking advan- 
tage of a technicality granted him by the 
Instrument, dismissed his parliament and pro- 
ceeded for eighteen months to rule without a 
parliament. 

So ended Cromwell's second- attempt to 
secure some sort of cooperation from what 
might be called, if not the nation, at least 
representatives of the classes who were trust- 
worthy from a Puritan point of view. He 
then proceeded to conduct the administration 
of the State much as he would conduct the ad- 
ministration of his army in the field. He dis- 
missed civil judges whose loyalty he had reason 
to doubt, exactly as James I. had done in the 



1901.]

days of Coke ; he even went a step beyond 
Charles and Wentworth, and virtually placed 
all England under martial law, dividing the 
country into eleven great military districts and 
placing over each a major-general, who was 
responsible only to the Protector and his coun- 
cil. With their assistance, the Protector pro- 
ceeded to bring England up to the Puritan 
standard, closing up the alehouses, abolishing 
bear-baiting by shooting the bears in their pens, 
and deporting people who made themselves ob- 
noxious to the Puritan community either by 
their immoral lives or an ostentatious advocacy 
of forms of Christian worship which had been 
proscribed by the State. Of the latter, however, 
it is always to be borne in mind that Cromwell 
showed little inclination to molest the sectaries 
of England and Scotland so long as their views 
were divorced from politics. But he did not 
hesitate to silence either Churchmen or Inde- 
pendent Levellers whenever they raised their 
voices against the existing order. 

With our modem respect for the sacred ness 
of constitutional forms, it is difficult to regard 
these acts of Cromwell in other light than the 
acts of a military tyrant. At every step of 
the great Protector, the unlovely jangle of the 
military spur grates harshly upon the ear. 
And yet it is to be borne in mind that few men 
of repute in Cromweirs time had any concep- 
tion of the right of a majority of the people to 
direct the ajffairs of the nation. In " the fun- 
damentals " which he tried to induce his recal- 
citrant parliament to respect, he showed a re- 
markable understanding of the true relations 
of the various arms of government to each other 
as embodied in English institutions ; and yet 
he had no conception of the authority of the 
majority as the justification of government. 
He had been set, not to execute the will of the 
nation as voiced in the expressed will of major- 
ities, but " to do God's people some good "; and 
even " God's people " did not always know 
what was best for their own good. Tried by 
the definitions of political science, Cromwell 
was unquestionably an usurper, a despot, and 
a tyrant, yet no usurpation was ever so justi- 
fied by the conditions which made it possible ; 
no despot was more sincere in his efforts to lead 
his people into righteous ways and save them 
from the results of vice on the one hand and 
anarchy on the other ; no tyrant ever tried 
harder to secure some legal basis for the 
authority which was denied him by the very 
laws which he strove to uphold.

Through Unknown Abyssinia.* 

Among the crowding calamities of the war 
in South Africa comes the death of Captain 
Montagu Sinclair Wellby, of the Eighteenth 
Hussars. Born in 1866, educated at Rugby and 
Sandhurst, and given his rank as captain in 
1894, he was then able to take up the life of an 
explorer in Africa, making extended journeys 
through Somaliland in successive years. In 
1 896 be went to Asia on the expedition through 
Cashmere, northern Thibet, Mongolia, and 
China, which is described in his well-known 
book, "Through Unknown Thibet." He re- 
turned to India, participated in the Tirah cam- 
paign, and, that ended, joined Colonel John 
Lane Harrington, British agent at the Abys- 
sinian court, at Harrar, in August, 1898. Ob- 
taining leave from the Emperor Menelik to 
traverse any part of his domains. Captain 
Wellby set out without a white companion at 
the close of 1898, explored vast regions of 
Abyssinian territory which had never before 
known the foot of a European, reached Lake 
Rudolf, met many strange tribes of natives, and 
came out at Omdurman in July, 1899. The 
South African war called him to the colors, 
and he died at Paardekop on August 5, 1899, 
having been shot by the burghers on his refusal 
to surrender after being surprised on a recon- 
noissance. 

The record of his last journey is preserved 
in the large and handsome volume entitled, 
'* 'Twixt Sirdar and Menelik," an interesting 
record of an important expedition, plentifully 
illustrated, but lacking a map and chronology 
as well as an index, which makes it less valu- 
able than its real importance deserves. The 
book is dedicated, by permission, to the Abys- 
sinian monarch, and has had the benefit of 
preparation at the hands of Colonel Harring- 
ton, who records in his introduction the unusual 
qualities possessed by his friend for the work 
he took up, noting among other things his abil- 
ity to make friends of the most uncompromis- 
ing and antagonistic material, from the " Lion 
of Judah " himself to the natives of " the devil- 
infested country of Walamo." These qualities 
appear in the book as well, leaving it a simple 
and picturesque recital of fact, modestly told 
but filled with the spirit of high resolve and 
courageous humility.

Abyssinian capital, where Captain Wellby was 
given an opportunity to study the methods of 
the Emperor's armies, the expedition set out 
from Adis Ababa with a mixed company of 
Abyssinians, Gallas, Somalis, and Soudanese, 
a Pathan native officer acting as its lieutenant. 
The caravan went along the River Maki to 
Lake Zauai, on the way south to Lake Lamina, 
previously unexplored and said to contain a 
great treasure hid by a Danakil chief on one of 
its islands in the sixteenth century, passing 
along the Suksuk to Lake Hera or Hora, and 
thence to the new body of water. Hostile natives 
prevented intimate acquaintance with the discov- 
ery, and the explorers hastened on to Wubar- 
akh. In the country of Walamo there was a 
curious experience with the " devils " of the 
country, from which Captain Wellby himself 
was not exempt — to his own surprise. Lake 
Rudolf, or Gallop, was attained and some ex- 
cellent shooting followed, rhinoceros, hippo- 
potamus, elephant, hartebeest, and gazelle con- 
tributing to the supply. Passing through many 
tribes of savages, the gigantic Turkana, the 
Abba, and the Tamata, the men suffered greatly 
from lack of water, but found relief among the 
Shingkalla. The Nile was reached at Nasser, 
and thereafter it was merely a question of float- 
ing down stream with it. The expedition dis- 
banded at Omdurman. 

The book is silent concerning the scientific 
results of the long and devious journey, but 
these will doubtless find the light elsewhere.

PoiiiTicAL Parties in the United 

States.* 



Professor Macy's contribution to the " Citi- 
zen's Library " was announced as a " History 
of Political Parties in the United States." The 
title-page, however, reads ♦♦ Political Parties 
in the United States, 1846-1861." The book 
is not an outline history of the rise and growth 
of parties and the development of party ma- 
chinery, as we expected it to be, but is a sort 
of running commentary on the political history 
of the United States with special reference to 
the period designated. 

The discussion throughout is characterized 
by breadth and liberality of spirit and by clear- 
ness of insight into the " view-points " of op- 
posing forces. Much 8pa<'e is devoted to " what

might have been." Professor Macy defends 
this course upon the ground that the principal 
purpose of historical study is to enable us to 
avoid in future the crimes and blunders that 
have resulted in disaster in the past. Never- 
theless, speculation as to what would have hap- 
pened, if that which did happen had not hap- 
pened, is capable of no positive proof and can 
result merely in the balancing of probabilities.. 
Professor Macy's principal contention is that 
the Civil War might have been averted had 
the Whig party in 1848 and thereafter taken 
strong ground against the extension of slavery 
to the territories, and made a strictly con- 
stitutional opposition to slavery a paramount 
issue. From this view we must wholly dissent. 
The Whig party furnished little ground for 
hope. It was a party of dead issues and pass- 
ing political leaders. It was a coalition of in- 
congruous elements, the protectionists of the 
North and nullifiers of the South. It had dis- 
claimed any principles in the campaign of 
1840, and received a deserved punishment in 
the accession of Tyler. The success of 1848 
was temporary and due solely to the personal 
popularity of a politically colorless candidate. 
Had the Whig party embraced its great op- 
portunity by taking a strong stand against the 
extension of slavery, it would have been im- 
mediately abandoned by its Southern wing and 
have become as sectional as the later Repub- 
lican party. It might have saved itself, but 
would not otherwise have greatly changed the 
course of history. The opposition to a reju- 
venated Whig party might have been less bit- 
ter than the opposition to the new Republican 
party, but the difference could not have been 
great enough to avert the war. The reasons 
why the war could not have been averted are 
strongly stated by Professor Macy himself. 

" We are told that the Muhammedan child is taught 
to lisp the word < infidel ' with all possible spite and 
venom. It is made a part of his religion to bate and 
despise the infidel. ... A similar training led abo- 
litionist and Southern ' fire-eater ' to hate and despise 
each other. In many a Northern family children grew 
up believing that life in the South was typified by the 
bloodhound, the auction- block, and the mob. And the 
children of the plantations were in their turn made to 
regard the pure-minded, self-sacrifieing, anti-slavery 
philanthropists as malignant aggressors, delighting in 
stirring up the negroes to exterminating warfare against 
the white South. ... A generation had grown up, 
honestly believing that the institution of slavery pos- 
sessed all moral and coustitutional sanctions. They 
could not understand the grounds of Northern opposi- 
tion ; and no more could the North understand the 
Southern position respecting slavery. For a whole 
generation a false system of moral instruction iu North

and South bad stifled the spirit of brotherhood and 
sown the dragon's teeth of misnnderstanding and mis- 
representation." 

This chasm between the sections was a slow 
and gradual development from the earliest 
times. It could have been bridged, if bridged 
at all, only by going at least as far back as 
the abolitionist agitation, and by substituting 
for it a moderate and reasoning anti-slavery 
movement which would not have excited the 
counter-revolution in the South. But such a 
substitution was scarcely within the range of 
possibility, so that affairs were bound to come, 
as they did, to such a pass that a war between 
the sections, to use the phrase of the late Gen- 
eral Jacob D. Cox, " was essential to the re- 
establishment of mutual respect."

qualities is displayed in this story of the Revolu- 
tionary War. There is much finish in the detail, 
bat there is nothing of the large imaginative sweep 
that should characterize historical romance. The 
best feature of Miss Jewett's book is found in its 
account of the brutal treatment meted oat to the 
tories in New England during the turbulent days 
that followed the outbreak of hostilities. This 
aspect of our revolutionary straggle has been treated 
in mach too gingerly a fashion by the historians, 
and it is onlv of recent years that the public has 
been told the truth aboat the matter. Miss Jewett 
tells the truth, and for this we may be thankful. 
Bat for the story of heroic deeds she has not the 
equipment, and her Paul Jones, for example, offers 
a weak contract to the figure of that captain as it 
appears in '*■ Richard Carvel," or even in the slap- 
dash books of Archdeacon Brady. We trast that 
Miss Jewett will at once go back to her study of 
the humors of the New England town. 

Mrs. Catherwood is better equipped with the 
faculty for dealing with the high and heroic mat- 
ters of history, but even she is well-advised to make 
character rather than action the main object of her 
attention. It is certainly refreshing to turn from 
the hackneyed story that Miss Jewett has told us 
to the narrative uf the lost dauphin as it has been 
reconstructed, from legend and imagination, by 
Mrs. Catherwood. Fur her " Lazarre " is nothing 
more than the youthful history of Eleazar Williams, 
that singular personality who was firmly believed 
by some to be no other than the child of the French 
king, rescued from the Temple, and brought to 
America. Both in Northern New York, where 
Williams lived among the Indians, and in the Green 
Bay region of Wisconsin, where he became one of 
the pioneers of Western civilization, the legendary 
story of his origin persists, and has resulted in a 
curious literature of the kind at which historians 
look askance, but which romantic and uncritical 
readers are apt to accept at something like its face 
value. Mrs. Catherwood appears (although perhaps 
only for the purposes of her novel) to accept the 
legend as true in its essentials, and has certainly 
achieved a remarkable success in making the figure 
of her Lazarre stand out as a living figure from 
her canvas. She follows him from his assumed de- 
portation to this country, through the early years 
of his life as the adopted son of an Indian chief, 
through the period of aroused self- consciousness 
when he comes to believe in his own exalted birth, 
down to the Western time when he puts aside all 
thoughts of claiming bis birthright, and casts in 
his lot with the new nation that be is helping to 
build up in the wilderness. Before this conclusion 
is reached, however, the author takes her hero to 
Europe, and provides him with a series of surprising 
adventures, both at the French court and at the 
far Northern court of the exiled Bourbon king. 
His final renunciation is determined by his love for 
a noble French woman, whom chance has brought 
to America, and with whose fortunes his own have

been singalarly intermingled ever since his child- 
hood. We began the reading of " Lazarre " with 
many misgivings, occasioned by the difficult nature 
of its subject rather than by doubts of the author's 
capacity, but as we read into the book, our interest 
grew deeper all the time, and its closing pages left 
OS with the feeling that, however fantastic its sub- 
stance, Mrs. Catberwood had contrived to give 
reality to both situations and characters, the feeling 
that, considering the difficulty of her subject, she 
had achieved an unusual and brilliant success. 

The figure of Aaron Burr is one that has long 
been waiting for effective portraiture at the hands 
of some artisan of historical romance. Within the 
last few months, two attempts have been made to 
attract novel-readers to this interesting personality, 
and both attempts are deserving of attention. Mr. 
W. H. Venable, in '< A Dream of Empire," takes 
up Burr's story at the time when, his term of office 
ended, he leaves the East a disgraced man, and 
embarks upon the mysterious undertaking whereby 
he hopes to carve out for himself a new political 
fortune in the Southwest. The scene is first laid 
in Blennerhassett Island, and shows us the con- 
spirator in the first stages of his enterprise. His 
fortunes are followed down to the final collapse of 
his scheme, the ruin of the Blennerhassetts, and 
the arrest of Burr on charges of treason. The story 
is picturesquely told, and is above the average as 
an example of the sort of book which it represents. 
Unfortunately, it is impossible to make a satisfac- 
tory hero of romance out of a man with Burr's 
record, and the feeling that he got no more than 
he deserved destroys the artistic effect of the tragedy 
of his life. 

Mr. C. F. Pidgin, whose " Blennerhassett" is the 
second of our Burr stories, realizes this difficulty 
so fully that he takes the bull by the horns from 
the start. Instead of apologizing for Burr, he 
champions him throughout, makes of him a com- 
pletely misunderstood and foully abused man, justi- 
fying his conduct where it has been most condemned. 
In order to carry out this plan, it becomes neces- 
sary to vilify both Hamilton and Jefferson, which 
is done without the least hesitation. The audacity 
of the thing fairly takes away one's breath. In 
order to rehabilitate his hero, the author invents 
imaginary documents, which are paraded with a 
great show of mystery ; but just as we expect to 
have their contents revealed, they are forever lost. 
As an illustration of the author's disingenuousness, 
we may cite the statement in his preface that Burr 
" was elected to the highest position in the gift of 
the American people." We cannot say that Mr. 
Pidgin has written a very good novel — in fact, he 
has not written a novel at all, but an imaginary 
biography, which is quite a different affair. It 
covers the whole of Burr's life, from the duel with 
Hamilton to Burr's death, but the portraiture is 
hopelessly distorted, and is quite unconvincing. 

Mr. Robert Neilson Stephens divides his attention 
about equally between English and American 



themes. " Captain Ravenshaw," his new novel, is 
a romance of English life in the days of Elizabeth. 
Not a historical novel in the sense of dealing with 
characters and happenings of resounding fame, it 
may be considered historical in what is perhaps a 
truer sense of the term. That is, it presents a 
carefully-studied picture of the life of the time con- 
cerned, and results from a conscientious effort to be 
truthful without being dull. It certainly is not 
dull, and we think the author has justified his own 
claim of being '< himself at home in Elizabethan 
London." Like another romance reviewed in this 
article, " Captain Ravenshaw " is occupied with the 
designs of an unscrupulous rake upon the person 
and fortunes of an heiress, and of course this vil- 
lainy is foiled after the required number of stirring 
episodes and the usual amount of agony. The novel 
is a fair average example of the class of writings 
to which it belongs. 

The " Cardigan " of Mr. Robert W. Chambers is 
far more than " a fair average example " of his- 
torical fiction. In this story of our revolutionary 
period he has even surpassed himself — which those 
who remember how highly we have thought of his 
previous work will understand to be praise indeed. 
We should call the book one of the half-dozen 
strongest and most fascinating romances of Amer- 
ican history that have been produced of recent 
years. The period is that of the single year pre- 
ceding the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington, and 
the scene is the Mohawk region whence the authority 
of Sir William Johnson was stretched forth to con- 
trol the turbulence of the Long House, and keep 
the warriors of the Six Nations on friendly terms 
with all the whites. The character of Johnson is 
depicted for us with loving skill, and we share in 
the tragedy of his death — for it was nothing less 
than a tragedy for him to see all his efforts made un- 
availing through the unscrupulous intrigues of Lord 
Danmore's agents, and to witness the hideous spec- 
tacle of his own English compatriots in league with 
savagery for the destruction of the revolting colo- 
nists. He, at least, remaining loyal to his King, and 
would have seen the battle fought out in accordance 
with the rules of civilized warfare ; it was the sor- 
row of his last days to see it waged with the sup- 
port of Indian allies. We spoke not long ago of 
the reappearance of the Indian in our American 
fiction. No better example could be afforded than 
the present novel, which presents to us the familiar 
figures of Brant and Logan, and which, further- 
more, exhibits a truly penetrative insight into Indian 
customs and modes of thought. We are almost 
inclined to look upon Johnson as the true hero of 
this romance, so commanding is his figure, and so 
compulsive of respect and admiration. But the 
story deals, after all, with the adventures of his 
ward, Michael Cardigan, a boy of sixteen in the 
opening chapters, and a man of seventeen at the 
close. It seems a purely wanton disregard of the 
probabilities to give us so youthful a hero. Nothing 
would have been lost, and much gained, by bestow-

ing upon him at least five more years. The most 
delicate piece of psychology in the book is offered 
by the gradual transformation of this boy's political 
ideals, through stress of circumstances, making in 
one short year an earnest patriot out of a fervent 
loyalist. We will not carp at this, because the 
author really performs the feat, although at the 
outset, although knowing that it must be done, we 
could not see how he was going to set about it. 

Novels of our Civil War are becoming increas- 
ingly frequent in American fiction. It would seem 
that we have at last reached the time when it is 
possible to take a dispassionate survey of that great 
convulsion, and when the spokesmen for either side 
can count upon a sympathetic hearing from the 
partisans of the other. This does not mean that 
our war novels are to acquire a neutral tint, because 
passion of some sort is essential to a vital descrip- 
tion of the war period, but it does mean that the 
majority of readers are ready to eschew bigotry in 
their championship of either cause, and are pre- 
pared to take a generous view of the motives of even 
those whom they believe to have been essentially in 
the wrong. Of recent war novels, "They That 
Took the Sword," by Mr. Nathaniel Stephenson, is 
a modest but unusually satisfactory performance. 
It deals with a few days only, in the summer of 
1862, and with a single episode of the struggle. 
The scene of the book is the city of Cincinnati, and 
its theme the attempted capture of the city by a 
sudden Confederate raid, abetted by the Southern 
sympathizers who formed a large part of the popu- 
lation of Cincinnati. The boyish hero of the story 
is pitifully weak, and his actions are such as to 
estrange our sympathies in large measure ; but he 
makes what atonement he can, and he is only a 
boy, after all. The closing scene in Washington, 
when he is pardoned by the President, is much like 
the similar scene in Mr. Churchill's "The Crisis," 
although the figure of Lincoln is not presented in 
as firm an outline. 

Since we last spoke of the monthly series of 
American novels provided by one of our oldest 
publishing houses, three new volumes have been 
added to the collection. " Westerf elt," by Mr. 
Will N. Harben, is a story of Northern Georgia, 
and introduces us to a very crude type of civiliza- 
tion. The hero is a young farmer who trifles with 
the affections of a rustic maiden, in consequence 
whereof she takes her own life and he is filled with 
remorse. Removing to a neighboring village, he 
buys a livery stable, and falls in love with the 
daughter of a woman who keeps the village hotel. 
This interferes with the designs of the village bully, 
who is a moonshiner and a leader of whitecaps. 
This ruffian makes several attempts upon the life 
of his rival, who manages to escape, although by 
no means with a whole skin. By these devices, and 
a miserable misunderstanding between the lovers, 
the story is kept going, bat it does not prove a re- 
markable performance. We may thank the writer, 
however, for his forbearance in the matter of dialect. 



" The Manager of the B. & A.," by Mr. Yaoghan 
Kester, is a much better book — in fact, it is one 
of the best of the whole series. It takes us to a 
small town in the lumber region of Michigan, and 
is concerned with the efforts of a new and energetic 
manager to build up the business of the railway. 
His reform measures make him unpopular, and he 
is soon confronted with a strike. At the same time, 
a family scandal is raked up against him, and serves 
still further to embitter the situation. The young 
woman with whom he has fallen in love treats him 
badly, and at last he gives up his job, and leaves 
the town which has become so stirred up against 
him. Presently, the safety of the town is threatened 
by a forest fire, communications are cut off, and 
the situation grows desperate. At this juncture, 
the hero has an opportunity of coming to the relief 
of his former fellow-citizens, by himself driving 
the locomotive that brings the needed fire-engines 
through the blazing forest. This act of daring 
causes a complete revulsion of feeling toward him, 
the young woman in question also sees the error of 
her ways, and everything ends happily, or at least 
as happily as could be expected. The story is a 
specimen of crisp and vigorous workmanship, typi- 
fying an important aspect of American life, and 
carries out the purpose of the series in which it 
appears rather better than most of the other volumes. 

Mr. A. Maurice Low, the author of " The Su- 
preme Surrender," is a Washington journalist and 
correspondent, and endeavors to picture the polit- 
ical and social life of our capital city. Long 
practice at his business, coupled with shrewd pow- 
ers of observation, has given him unusual qualifi- 
cations for the task which he has undertaken. We 
cannot escape the temptation to think of his studies 
of public men as partaking of the character of 
portraiture, although it is probable that most of his 
figures are composites. One Senator, however, is 
hardly to be mistaken, so accurately are his public 
activities and political methods presented. The 
time of the story is one of great political tension ; 
there is great danger of a war with England, and 
the conservative elements of the government find 
it almost impossible to keep the nation to a rational 
course. The private interest of the story centres 
about a conspicuous Senator and the daughter of 
a member of the Cabinet. The Senator is married, 
but the young woman in question falls in love with 
him, and has no hesitation in telling him about it. 
His feelings are reciprocated, and the affair goes 
on in clandestine fashion until it gets to be talked 
about, and they realize that they stand upon the 
brink of a social abyss. They both try to convince 
themselves that their love is not wrongful, and in 
this endeavor, elaborate a novel theory of the mar- 
riage state. Marriage, they conclude, should be a 
contract for three years, terminable at the pleasure 
of the parties concerned. But this theory differs 
so greatly from the practice of society in its present 
benighted stage of evolution that when the critical 
period is reached in their relations, the young

woman impalsively decides to marry a persistent 
old-time l()ver for whom she cares little or nothing, 
and the Senator, after making a great speech and 
then resigning his ofiSce, finds the problems of des- 
tiny all solved for him by the fatal bullet of an 
anarchist, conveniently provided for the occasion. 
We do not think much of this book on its ethical 
side; on its intellectual side, it has a certain hard 
and incisive brilliancy that attracts attention. It is 
a good deal like Mrs. Atherton's " Senator North," 
the resemblance being rather closer than ought to 
exist between two novels by different hands. 

For the last time, so Mr. Gilbert Parker assures 
us, has he drawn upon the Canadian storehouse for 
the material of his fiction. This is a matter of 
regret, for no one before him has made the Cana- 
dian past, as embodied in history, or the Canadian 
present, as embodied in the humble lives of the 
eoureur de hois and the habitant, so vivid to our 
gaze, or so pregnant with dramatic or pathetic 
possibilities. " The Right of Way " is a story of 
rather recent times, and the scene (except for a 
sort of prologue) is laid in a remote village of Que- 
bec. It is a strong and beautiful story, telling 
how a brilliant but dissipated lawyer of Montreal 
becomes dead to the world through an accident, 
and how he takes up life anew in the humblest 
of village surroundings, and becomes in some sort 
the good genius of the place. He will not return 
to his old home, although his reputation has been 
unjustly blasted, because his return would bring 
mictery to others ; and he is content to leave a tar- 
nished name among the circles in which he once 
moved that he may save from suffering the wife 
who, believing him dead, has become happily 
married to another. This is, no doubt, a very 
high pitch of moral heroism, and, taken together 
with his ready acceptance of a life against which 
all the instincts of such a man would have revolted, 
it strains the reader's credulity almost to the 
breaking point ; but, once admitting the essential 
improbability of the situation, the working-out is 
both ingenious and logical. " The Right of Way " 
is not a better book than Mr. Parker's two other 
long novels, but it is upon about their level of 
achievement, and is certainly one of the eight 
or ten best novels of the year. 

Mr. Kipling's new novel is a story of the India 
that he knows so well — a story entirely without 
love-making or other sentimental interest of the 
conventional sort, yet singularly enthralling. It 
is entitled *' Kim," which is the name of the 
principal character. Kim is a child of Irish par- 
entage, cast as a waif upon the sea of Indian life 
when an infant, and growing up under native in- 
fluences. He is a preternaturally shrewd little 
beggar, and has had to learn the lesson of living by 
his wits from his earliest years. Although he 
speaks English, he prefers Hindostanee, and the 
racial traits that are his by inheritance seem to 
have been almost wholly submerged. They re- 
appear after it is discovered that he is Kimball 



O'Hara, the son of a former soldier, and when his 
education is taken in hand by his father's regi- 
ment. His unusual gifts are marked out by certain 
government officials, and be is put in training for the 
Secret Service, in which department we feel quite 
sure that he will become distinguished, although 
the book ends when he is upon the threshold of his 
new career. The story offers us a great variety of 
Oriental types of race and character, including the 
winning personality of a Thibetan holy man, seek- 
ing through long years and in strange lands for the 
river of cleansing whereby he may gain the longed- 
for release from the Wheel of Change. The Bud- 
dhist attitude toward life is very sympathetically 
figured in this venerable character, who seems to 
us quite as interesting as Kim himself. It is need- 
less to say that few Europeans understand the 
workings of the Oriental mind as Mr. Kipling 
understands them, and far fewer have his gift of 
imparting the understanding to their readers. 
Among English writers, he has been matched by 
Mrs. Steel, but hardly by any other in our day. 

Mr. George Moore's '• Sister Teresa " is a sf quel 
to " Evelyn Innes." It describes the growth of 
the singer's determination to forsake the world, the 
breaking of her relations with the two lovers who 
had so influenced her life, her tentative experience 
of the convent, the death of her father, and the 
taking of her religious vows. The scene of the 
book is laid for the most part in the convent, and 
the story is little more than the analysis of her 
swaying emotions as she is urged now this way and 
now that, as the world and the church alternately 
appeal to her distracted spirit. The book is unde- 
niably a dull one — as dull as the "En Route" 
of M. Huysmanns, which it inevitably brings to 
mind, — and it is a book which leaves an unpleasant 
taste in the mouth. Its best pages are those which 
deal, as in its predecessor, with musical themes. 

" Philbrick Howell," by Mr. Albert Kinross, is 
a novel of modern English life, chiefly concerned 
with the fortunes of a young man of letters. He 
is in love from childhood with a girl who seems 
worthy of him, but who in reality is shallow and sel- 
fish. His own generous nature cannot see in her the 
defects that are evident to others, and his devotion 
is unbroken until in the end she reveals herself in 
an unmistakeable light. He finds the usual conso- 
lation in the love of another girl, but this part of 
the story is not very convincingly managed. Nor 
are the probabilities very strictly observed in de- 
scribing the hero's career as a novelist. Such im- 
mediate success as comes to him is anything but 
the rule of authorship. The story is pleasantly 
told, with animation and genuine sentiment. 

Mr. Hall Caine is doubtless a fair mark for ad- 
verse criticism, yet we cannot hold to be either 
generous or fair the dead set that the English re- 
viewers have made against " The Eternal City."

many faults of taste, granting that improbabilities

style is often mechanical and of gaide-book inspi- 
ration, yet there remain qualities sufficiently im- 
pressive to deserve for the book a more respectful 
hearing than it is receiving from most quarters. 
In the first place, its idealism, although both Utopian 
and sentimental, is on the whole of the inspiring 
sort. Then its picture of the social and political 
conditions of modern Italy, although drawn with 
melodramatic intent, is correct in its main outlines, 
and has been carefully studied from the documents. 
Finally, the plot of the story, although far from 
original, and audacious beyond what is fairly per- 
missible, is well put together, and keeps the interest 
of the reader in a condition of breathless tension. 
"We certainly do not believe in the practicability of 
Mr. Caine's special type of Christian socialism, nor 
do we condone his half-veiled apology for the 
methods of violence in revolution, but we believe 
that the book is a sincere expression of the author's 
outlook, clouded by sentiment as that may be, and 
distorted by his unbalanced judgment. And, after 
all, the author's vision of a purged Italy, of a spir- 
itualized papacy and a republican polity, is essen- 
tially no other than the vision of Mazzini, and that 
is the divinest vision that has been vouchsafed to 
any Italian of the last century. We cannot help 
balking at the improbability of the heroine's con- 
duct in betraying her husband. A woman of Roma's 
finesse and penetration could not have been tricked 
so easily, and would never have succumbed to the 
pressure put upon her. The appearances of the 
Pope as a character in the story are usually unfor- 
tunate. Despite labored attempts to maintain the 
dignity of his office and the saintly character of the 
venerable man, the author has distinctly failed in 
investing him with the attributes that both art and 
historical fact demand. For in spite of certain 
deliberate confusions of character and biography, 
this figure is in the main intended for that of the 
present pontiff, just as the figure of the King is 
that of the present ruler, and just as the figure of 
Banelli is that of the prime minister so recently 
deceased. But for all these strictures we are not 
disposed to visit " The Eternal City " with utter 
condemnation, or to deny it the possession of many 
remarkable qualities. 

" The Lady of Lynn," a posthumous novel by Sir 
Walter Besant, is an excellent example of the art, 
or artifice, of this pleasant story-teller. It is a tale 
of the last century, and has for its theme the 
machinations of a London gambler and rake, who 
learns of the existence of an unsophisticated heiress 
in the quiet seaport of Lynn, and who marshalls 
his disreputable allies to descend upon the town, 
and help him bear her off. It takes a good deal of 
rather ponderous machinery to carry this plot into 
effect, and Lvnn for a time is turned into a gay resort 
of fashion. We need not say that the villain is foiled, 
and that the virtuous maiden bestows her charms 
and her wealth upon the man who loves her for her- 
self, and who is instrumental in rescuing her from 
her persecutors. William Mobtok Patnb. 



NOTES ON NOVELS. 



The student of character will detect a certain incon- 
sistency between the recent public speeches of Mr. Will- 
iam Allen White and his well-told stories of American 
political life, now gathered together in a book with the 
excellent title of " Stratagems and Spoils " (Scribner). 
In the speeches, Mr. White extols the glory of America, 
and urges the extension of our beneficent inflaence 
throughout the world ; in the stories he paints with 
merciless truth the complete lack of idealism in our 
political methods, selecting typical examples of thieves 
and robbers in the States and nation, and apologizing 
for the universal deference to money, however obtained, 
by stating in his preface that our politicians are quite 
as moral in their way as our lawyers, merchants, and 
clergymen, in theirs. This combination of political 
optimism and pessimism in one personality, the reader 
of Mr. White's book is permitted to account for as 
best he may. Certainly the graphic and convincing 
tales he has here set down contain the trnth graphic- 
ally set forth, and with much knowledge of literary 
art. They are interesting to a degree. 

Mr. George Horton has contrived a pleasant disap- 
pointment in his new tale of modern Greece, ** The 
Tempting of Father Anthony " (McClurg). With a 
humor and quaintness quite bis own, be gives the his- 
tory of a lad, the son of the village priest, who feels 
himself called to a life of extreme asceticism after the 
manner of St. Anthony the Great. With little of pa- 
rental encouragement, he implants himself in a monas- 
tery not far from his home, leaving this, after years 
spent in holy living, for a life in a distant retreat. But 
in his wandering he meets a beautiful girl, nature as- 
serts herself above austere religion, and, it being the 
policy of the Greek Church to discourage monasticism, 
Mr. Horton is able to make that time honored happy 
ending to his book which should end all romances. 

Messrs. Samuel W. Merwin and Henry K. Webster 
continue to develope the vein of commercial romance 
they discovered in their first book through the last from 
their joint pens, " Calumet ' K ' " (filacmillan). The 
narrative is chiefly concerned with the erection of a 
huge elevator on the bank of the Calumet River in 
South Chicago, its completion within a given time being 
absolutely necessary in order to break a "corner" in 
wheat. The undertaking calls forth all the resources 
of the modern contractor, complicated by chicanery on 
the part of the railways interested in the "corner," by 
labor troubles, accidents, and a number of minor 
causes. A simple romance is threaded through the 
exciting and well-told story, which is one for business 
men to find interest in, as well as the classes more ac- 
customed to reading fiction other than that provided 
by the daily papers. 

With painstaking and patience, Mr. John Uri Lloyd 
is reaching toward literary comprehension. " Warwick 
of the Kuobs " (Dodd) is a second " Stringtown " story, 
dealing with the primitive religion and passion of the 
provincial Kentuckians of that locality. The hero, 
from whom the book takes its title, is a hard-shell Bap- 
tist preacher during war times. A Southern sympa- 
thizer on the border, he is drawn into the conflict upon 
which his two eldest sons have entered with much un- 
willingness, only to come into greater grief through the 
betrayal of his daughter by a Northern college student 
who has been his guest while investigating the geolog- 
ical formations of the neighborhood. There is the

tendency to discursiveness so marked in the former 
books from this hand, though in less degree; and a gen- 
eral formlessness in structure, though this again shows 
improvement. Mr. Lloyd will do better still. 

A well-finished novel from a new hand may be rec- 
ommended in Mrs. Elinor Macartney Lane's "Mills of 
God" (Appleton). The name of the author is an as- 
sumed one, taken for the purpose of aiding the veraci- 
ousness of the story, which deals with aristocratic life 
in Virginia at the close of the eighteenth century and 
the beginning of the nineteenth. The heroine is of 
royal descent on one side, and the hero an English no- 
bleman with whom, though married, she fell in love. 
The child of this passion plays an important part in the 
prettily told narrative, disagreeable as the facts dealt 
with must be considered. The feeling of the period is 
transferred successfully, though there is an absence of 
what might be called national Americanism rather 
startling to contemplate. 

Philadelphia, a Republican city, is in the hands of a 
political machine quite as corrupt and irresponsible as 
Tammany in its worst days. It is of an imaginary 
character who attains the headship of this vast ring 
that Mr. Francis Churchill Williams writes in "J. 
Devlin — Boss " (Lothrop), a political novel of more than 
ordinary interest. Devlin comes into view as the " copy 
boy " on a morning newspaper, entering into politics as 
he grows older as naturally as an American business 
man keeps out of it. Climbing on the heads of his fel- 
lows through sheer strength of character, he soon be- 
comes the boss of the water-ofBce, withstanding until 
the close of the book the desultory efforts of the re- 
spectable element in the community to oust him. Mr. 
Williams lets his readers see what it is that gives Dev- 
lin his power, and adds greatly to our general knowledge 
of municipal affairs. A pleasant love-story runs beside 
the political exposition. 

The " Portrait Series " which the Messrs. Harper 
are publishing shows the widest variance in the stand- 
ard of the short stories that make up the several vol- 
umes. Mr. Van Tassel Sutphen's "The Nineteenth 
Hole," for example, contains the lightest trifles written 
around the game of golf and the fashion of riding in 
self-moving vehicles. It requires a decided interest in 
either pursuit to make make them readable, the cumu- 
lative effect of a volume of them being almost appall- 
ing. On the other hand. Miss Elizabeth C. Jordan's 
«« Tales of a Cloister " afford a most interesting glimpse 
into convent life in the United States, being drawn 
largely from the writer's own education in a convent 
school. The sweetness and sincerity of the sisters, the 
innumerable problems presented by their pupils from 
the outer world, the beautiful atmosphere of unques- 
tioned faith and hope combine to make the book note- 
worthy and attractive. 

Not the kailyards, but the Scotch mid die- classes, 
are drawn upon for the material Mr. George Douglas 
uses in " The House with the Green Shutters " (Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co.). The story deals with the ac- 
cumulating misfortunes of a family whose head has 
made much money by shop- keeping. A slattern of a 
wife and a fool of a son combine to bring the story to 
an unmitigated tragedy, the doom of degeneracy. 
Sombre and unrelieved, there is a searching of hearts 
and analysis of motives which place the novel on a 
high plane among its fellows. Quite incidentally, the 
evils of unrestricted competition are shown without pal- 
iation. However little the commnnity in which the | 



story is placed may appeal to the reader, it serves as 
an admirable human background for the fate which 
creeps so relentlessly upon the house of Gourlay. 

« The Road to Ridgeby's " (Small, Maynard & Co.) 
is a tender romance in which the asperities of farming 
life in Iowa are softened and idealized. It is by the late 
Frank Burlingame Harris, a young newspaper writer of 
fine ambition, and is remarkably free from the errors 
which so often go into a first book. It tells the tale 
of a rich young man who is seized with the desire to 
wander. His journey brings him to the home of a col- 
lege girl, the adopted daughter of a farmer. Her 
academic career ended, she returns home and bravely 
seeks to repay her foster parents by pledging her hand 
to the man who holds the mortgage on their farm. 
The vivifying power of true love shines through the 
story, and keeps it sweet and spiritual. 

Henry of Navarre is a prime favorite in song and 
story, and the prevailing taste in historical novels 
leaves his memory no opportunity for neglect. It is 
about his career in early life that Mr. Hamilton Driim- 
mond has written the first of two recently published 
novels, giving the book an appropriate title, from the 
faithful servant of the King who attends his fortunes 
through its pages, "A King's Pawn" (Doubleday). 
Mr. Drummond has filled his story with war and mi- 
nor battle, the clashing of swords and rattling of ac- 
coutrements. Having done this, he is content to leave 
love quite out of the question, — a woman's vengeance 
taking its place. In the other story, " The Seven 
Houses" (Stokes), compensation is made by giving the 
book a heroine and hardly a hero at all. Here again 
France is dealt with, and there is some little fighting; 
but it is rather a war of wits than of armed men. The 
narrative is well put together, and the astrological 
prediction of the first chapter governs the rest. 

Mr. James O. G. Duffy has taken a most dramatic 
incident in the history of one of the curious religious 
sects with which America is filled, for the foundation 
of his first novel, "Glass and Gold" (Lippincott). A 
girl, misled by her teacher, a clergyman in the sect, is 
beloved by an artist. Reading a book on confession, 
by her betrayer, she is persuaded by its reasoning to 
make public confession of her fault to the Californian 
congregation to which she belongs, in order to bring a 
clean record to her affianced husband. The rest of the 
book tells how she sought to live down the consequent 
scandal, essaying an entrance upon society in New 
York and Ireland, after being left a fortune by her 
heart-broken father. 

Two recent collections of stories show a remarkable 
similarity of contents. Both are written in an English 
provincial dialect, both deal with the somewhat primi- 
tive passions of a simple village folk, and both are 
told in an artless manner, differing wholly from the 
treatment an American usually gives such themes. 
One is "Dunstable Weir" (Scribner), by "Zack" 
(Miss Gwendoline Keats) ; the other, " The Striking 
Hours" (Stokes), by Mr. Eden Phillpotts. The differ- 
ences in treatment are largely due to the difference in 
sex of the two authors. He tells, for example, of fights, 
with a zest that is somewhat lacking in those which she 
describes. The dialects used are, to an American, very 
much the same, — or no further apart, let us say, than 
the speech of Virginia and of Massachusetts. 

" The Last of the Knickerbockers " (Stone) is a di- 
verting little book, fully carrying out the promise of 
Mr. Herman Knickerbocker Viel^'s earlier " Inn of the 



1901.]

Silver Moon." It deals with the two classes that go to 
make up New York "society," — the old Dutch fami- 
lies on one side, and the newly- rich on the other. At 
the boarding-house of Mrs. Bella Ruggles, a number 
of the old families sequester themselves in shabby- 
genteel splendor. Not far away, the largest operator 
in Wall Street inhabits a palace of Roman magnifi- 
cence. Between these two households the action of 
the book is divided. The story is interesting in itself, 
and the manner of telling it is still better, with wit 
and satire, and a love for New York which is almost 
pathetic in its intensity. 

Jones Berwick is the hero of Mr. B. K. Benson's " A 
Friend with the Countersign " (Macmillan), as he was 
of " Who Goes There? " But it is a Berwick freed 
from the incubus of a dual personality, though still en- 
gaged in scouting for the Union armies. Engaged to 
Lydia Khayme as he was at the close of the former 
book, the element of romance is lacking here, as well as 
that of mystery; and the author relies upon the fascinat- 
ing life of a scout for holding his readers' interest. 
Though the book is unusually long, it will be read with 
unabated interest by those who like hairbreadth escapes, 
the frequent references to official documents m the foot- 
notes giving it the air of complete reality. 

As an excellent bit of fun. Miss Molly Elliot Sea- 
well's latest story, " Papa Bouchard " (Scribner), may 
be cheerfully commended. It deals with the revolt of 
an elderly bachelor, an advocate of Paris, against the 
domination of an elder maiden sister with whom he has 
lived for more years than he cares to acknowledge in 
his emancipated condition. He is joined by a faithful 
valet, and even by the family parrot, which developes 
into the most ribald of birds in his new-found liberty. 
The hero, from whom the book is named, comes upon 
a designing widow at the beginning of his independent 
career. She and his ward and niece, and the latter's 
husband, an army officer, contrive to get him into a tri- 
angular difficulty over a diamond necklace, which pro- 
duces a ridiculous and laughable situation. " Sprightly " 
is a favorite word of Miss Seawell's, and it well de- 
scribes the narrative. 

Mr. Guy Boothby has written a sequel to his previous 
accounts of the life-history of a strange man, with the 
title " ' Farewell, Nikola ' " (Lippincott) ; and having 
disposed of this character for a time, has gone on with 
a detective story of the approved sort, called " My 
Strangest Case" (Page). In the former book, there is 
the usual combination of hypnotism, ability to read the 
future, experimentation with unknown drugs of un- 
known powers, revenge, and death. Doctor Nikola is 
still engaged in attempting to discover the secret of 
life, and the book closes with his future apparently 
bound up in a Thibetan lamasery, whither he has gone 
to learn the mystical lore of its inmates. In the latter 
story, one man robs his two companions of the jewels 
they have discovered in Burmese China, and they de- 
vote their lives henceforth to the attempt to bring him 
to justice, the Chinese having captured the twain, 
blinded one, and cut out the tongue of the other. Fair- 
fax, the famous London thief-taker, is called in. Tra- 
gedy closes the book as it opened it. Incidentally, a 
number of Fairfax's other experiences are narrated. 
Dealing with all that is weird and uncauuy, Mr. Boothby 
holds the secret of keeping his readers' attention, and 
the two books are certainly exciting. 

Somewhere between the Alleghenies and the Miss- 
issippi River lies the little town in which the scene of 



"Jack Racer" (McClnre, Phillips & Co.) is placed. 
The author, Mr. Henry Somerville, has made a faith- 
ful picture of American life in a minor town under 
settled conditions, his knowledge of young manhood 
and womanhood enabling him to give his readers a 
subtle and interesting account of the manner in which 
the hero comes into his own, — which means, among 
other things, the love of a charming girl. A bit of 
politics, of the better sort, enlivens the story. 

As may be expected in Miss Anna B. Fuller's lit- 
erary work, "Katharine Day" (Putnam) is a worthy 
novel. The scene is laid in a New England college 
town — which is quite unmistakably Cambridge. Here 
the fortunes of the heroine are followed from her 
motherless infancy, through a disappointment in love 
and sorrow over the incapacity of an only brother, to a 
finding of herself as a trained nurse visiting among the 
poor, and eventual happiness. Four or five of the 
characters stand out as vivid portraits and studies of 
American types, not the least notable being a grand- 
mother who represents the best New England tradi- 
tions and inherited common-sense. 

One of the more recently formed territories of the 
United States makes its bow to literature in Mrs. 
Helen Church Candee's dramatic "Oklahoma Romance" 
(Century Co.). Suitably enough, the story turns on a 
contested land-claim, in which a villainons Westerner 
tries to wrest from a recent importation from the East 
his well-won acres near a growing " city," only to be 
baffled in the end by the Westerner's own daughter, 
who loves and is loved by the " tenderfoot." A vivid 
impression of life in a new and unsettled community 
is given, with ambushes, murders, and all the varied 
incidents of the frontier. 

Abandoning his field of historical romance for a 
comparatively modern day, Mr. Halliwell Sutcliffe sets 
an amiable example to his fellow romancers. But 
"Mistress Barbara" (Crowell) is a compromise at 
best, for the tale is concerned with love, like his older 
romances, its modernity being only partially apparent 
in the setting in Yorkshire about the year 1830. There 
is a strike in the woollen mills in the neighborhood, 
which the hero does not suffer from because he has 
always treated his own men with consideration — a 
distinct advance over such a contest between capital 
and labor as Charles Reade once dealt with. It is 
pleasant to observe that Mr. Sutcliffe is not a man with 
a single string to his bow, and it is to be hoped that 
he will write more books of this latter sort. 

Mrs. Sarah P. McL. Greene has woven a somewhat 
intricate love-story into her latest book, "Flood- Tide" 
(Harper). The scene is placed in a fishing village on 
the North Atlantic coast, a region just now popular 
with authors. The " natives " — curiously individual 
folk, and strongly suggestive of the loss in picturesqe- 
ness which city polish entails — throng the pages with 
their quaint sayings and beliefs, expanding the book to 
twice what its size would otherwise be, and making it 
delightfully desultory. Religion plays no small part 
in the argument, the ancient salty expounder of the 
Apocalypse being a treasure to be cherished among 
characters of fiction. 

Now that Mr. Mark Ashton has called attention to 
it in » She Stands Alone, the Story of Pilate's Wife " 
(Page), all the world will wonder why this woman has 
so long been neglected in Christian song and story. 
As the author says, it was Pilate's wife alone who 
pleaded for the life of Jesus when all his followers had

denied or left him. Utilizing the scanty legends that 
have grown up about the life of Pilate, introducing 
several historical characters of the day, and informing 
the whole with knowledge of classical times, Mr. Ash- 
ton has written a strong story, certain to command 
attention. The tone of the book is dignified and ele- 
vated; but it is doubtful taste to make pictures that 
have been made for other purposes serve as illustra- 
tions here. 

A very pretty and vivacious story has Miss Frances 
Aymar Mathews made of " My Lady Peggy Goes to 
Town" (Bo wen-Merrill). The influence of the play- 
wright's art is shown in the manner in which the work 
is put together, and few changes would be needed to 
fit it for stage presentation as a comedy. Lady Peggy 
takes on the apparel of her twin brother, and under- 
goes the most surprising adventures, at one time being 
at the point of hanging as a highwayman. Not much 
attention is paid to the historical or other probabilities; 
but the rapidity of the action and interest of the dia- 
logue would carry oflP even greater faults. The illus- 
trations by Mr. Harrison Fisher are excellently done. 

A charming humanity lifts "'Lias's Wife" (Page) 
far above most studies of American rural life. The 
inhabitants of one of the little islands off the coast of 
Maine constitute most of the characters, but the hero- 
ine is of French descent and daintiness, and the story 
revolves around the coming of a young clergyman to 
the island to spend a summer. Quaint Yankee humor, 
the ability to draw a personality in a few sharp and 
unerring strokes, and a most interesting body of men, 
women, and children, make this latest of Mrs. Martha 
Baker Dunn's books a pleasant one to read. 

The tender history of a crippled foundling, adopted 
by a young woman of means after her convalescence 
from serious illness in the hospital at the door of which 
the baby has been left, will be found delicately and 
sympathetically told in "As a Falling Star" (Mc- 
Clurg), from the pen of Miss Eleanor Gaylord Phelps. 
The little boy is one of those hopeless physical wrecks 
of our civilization whose end is bound to come when 
life is hardly begun, but his spiritual service to the 
girl who loves him shows that he has not lived in vain. 
The theme is a difficult one, but handled with skill for 
a first literary effort. 

It must be something of a tax on the inventors of 
detective stories to bring their leading characters back 
to life after killing them at the close of an earlier book. 
"Raffles: Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracks- 
man " (Scribner) is an illustration of this, the hero be- 
ing left some miles from human aid in the Mediterra- 
nean Sea in a previous work narrating his exploits. 
But he is very much alive indeed here, and after a life 
of intelligently conducted criminality puts a climax to 
it by going to South Africa to shoot burghers. Though 
left for dead again, it will doubtless be possible for his 
creator, Mr. E. W. Hornung, to bring him forth once 
more, at least. 

In the way of historical romance. Miss Lafayette 
McLaws's « When the Land Was Young " (Lothrop) is 
both dramatic and picturesque. Much of its action re- 
volves around the old city of St. Augustine. The 
Spaniards take a Carolina Huguenot from the hands of 
his captors, the Yemasee Indians, and one of his neigh- 
bors goes to his rescue. With the help of a Choctaw 
chief, the Frenchman and his charming daughter are 
released, although the rescuer falls a prisoner in their 
stead. He in turn is released by a buccaneer ; and after 



a period of stress under Morgan, with plenty of good 
fighting, the book closes peacefully enough at Versailles. 
There is action and to spare, with no flagging in inter- 
est from beginning to end. 

Mrs. Katharine Tynan Hinkson provides her public 
with another tale of Irish life among the gentler 
classes, in " That Sweet Enemy " (Lippincott). Here 
the daughter of an impoverished house with a private 
feud against the descendants of those who have come 
into their former estates is taught, after a long strug- 
gle, to love the enemies of her family — who have been 
living in complete ignorance of the prejudice. A taste 
of the revolt against British tyranny always in the 
hearts of the oppressed Irish peasantry adds life and 
action to the pages. 

The Rev. Robert Mclntyre appears as the author of 
a •' first novel " in " A Modern Apollos " (Jennings 
& Pye). There is a great deal of the author himself 
in the narrative; his clerical experience, his knowledge 
of the Scotch character, and his early life as a black- 
smith, all being drawn upon. A huge conspiracy 
against the currency of the nation gives him a small 
army of desperate villains for a background, and 
through their instrumentality the hero proves himself 
a very muscular Christian indeed. There is material 
enough for twenty stories in the work, which is here 
rather ill digested into one. 

A modern novel, half Scotch and half English, and a 
collection of short stories with their scenes laid in Scot- 
land and Austria, are Mr. S. R. Crockett's contributions 
to the fiction of the day. In " Cinderella," a little 
Scotch girl is defrauded of her heritage by her most 
respectable uncle, who goes to the extent of ordering 
her arrest for the theft of one of the rubies brought her 
by her father from Burmah, all the others being in his 
possession. In "Love Idylls," nine tales of various 
length, all concerned with the master passion, combine 
to entertain the reader. Mr. Crockett is always inter- 
esting, and these exercises in various styles of the art 
of fiction will please many readers. Both books are 
published by Dodd, Mead & Co. 

Hostilities with the Indians on the Western frontier 
during the second war of independence against Great 
Britain give Mr. James Ball Naylor the materials for 
"The Sign of the Prophet " (Saalfield), General Harri- 
son and Chief Tecumseh both appearing among the 
characters. The siege at Fort Meigs, and the rein- 
forcements brought to Harrison by General Clay, close 
the story, which owes much of its interest to the daring 
of Mr. Naylor's hero, a scout. The book is simply con- 
structed and of considerable historical interest. 

A somewhat conventional love-story is to be read in 
"The Marriage of Mr. Merivale" (Putnam), by Mr. 
Cecil Headlam. The hero is forced to care for an 
invalid mother during the ten years that elapse before 
seeing the girl of his heart again, and in that time he 
gets into trouble with the inevitable Frenchwoman of 
the English novelist, — a woman so much more attract- 
ive than the other that the reader's sympathies are in 
danger of confusion. The book begins with a cricket- 
naatch, — reminding one of the rarity of that game in 
English fiction. 

Still more conventional, though a society detective 
story, is Miss Adeline Sargent's " My Lady's Dia- 
monds " (Buckles). A woman received freely into the 
best houses of England turns out to be the wife of a 
convict who has served his term, using her position for 
the purpose of robbing her hostess. She manages to

throw suspicion on the betrothed of an Englishman, 
who is certainly not a Sherlock Holmes, and his blun- 
dering spins the story out to the usual length. The 
wrongfully accused girl suffers much through her 
lover's stupidity, but it all comes right in the end. 

Life in a little town on the New England coast is 
described in Miss Mary Devereux's " Up and Down 
the Sands of Gold " (Little, Brown, & Co.). The story 
is discursive, filled with anecdotes of the quaint folk 
who populate the place in rather abrupt contrast with 
a family of Creoles living iu one of the old houses. 
The book is not as impressive as the author's earlier 
*' From Kingdom to Colony," though its action takes 
place in the present day. 

Such an atmosphere as dwells around the Knights of 
the Round Table is used with great skill by K. and 
Hesketh Prichard in their " Karadac, Count of Gersay " 
(Stokes), "Gersay" being an ancient spelling of the 
name of the island between France and England better 
known as Jersey. The time is that of William the 
Conqueror; but the hero is a Celt, the deeds are those 
of romantic chivalry, and the book is in no strict sense 
historical. Such legendary lore as it utilizes is more 
than welcome, and the idealism and interest of the 
book make it notable among its fellows. 

Mrs. Hugh Eraser (a sister of Mr. Marion Craw- 
ford) has made a readable book of «' Marna's Mutiny " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.). It is concerned, like others of 
her writings, with the always interesting country of 
Japan; a daughter of one of the Scandinavian consuls 
being the heroine. Into every incident of the book 
something of the country itself is brought, and it 
makes an admirable background for the little idyl it 
enshrines. In addition, there is a minor love story or 
two, by way of variety. 

Piety is the dominant note in Miss Amy Le Feuvre's 
" Heather's Mistress " (Crowell). Twin girls, orphaned 
in early life and left quite alone in the world, except 
for faithful servants, by the subsequent death of their 
stern old grandmother, are taken from Quaker sur- 
roundings out into the great world. Then, after tast- 
ing of its pleasures, they return home to find peace 
and comfort in religion. We think Miss Le Feuvre 
is writing without knowledge of Quaker life, thought, 
or ideals, turning that amiable sect into an evangelical 
Christian body without compunction. 

Austria is seemingly remote from the world of the 
novelist, and it is with unusual interest that Madame 
Longard de Longgarde's novel, "The Million" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), will be read. The author's earlier 
books, in which she made her maiden name of Doro- 
thea Gerard well-known, is guarantee of good work- 
manship, and her residence since her marriage in 
Austria opens up a new field for her English readers. 
The action of " The Million " takes place in a city of 
Galicia, not far from the Roumanian frontier. The 
story is strong and convincing, and must add to the 
reputation of the author. 

A sculptor in posse catches a glimpse of a pretty 
girl who has gone in bathing with some of her fellows 
in a decidedly unconventional manner, as he is passing 
with a tray of plaster casts on his head. The girl's 
mother befriends him, when she hears that he is ambi- 
tious to study in Italy. A few years after, the family 
go to that delightful land, and learn in Rome that the 
young peddler has risen to fame through a statue 
which he has made. This achievement gives name to 
Mr. Franklin Kent Gifford's " Aphrodite, the Ro- 



mance of a Sculptor's Masterpiece " (Small, Maynard 
& Co.). The resemblance of the statue to the girl 
who really inspires it gives rise to gossip. The narra- 
tive is clouded by doubts as to whether the sculptor is 
really in love with the mother who befriended him, or 
the daughter who admired him. The characters are 
well drawn, and the theme a novel and entertaining 
one. The main situation, it may be noted, is not unlike 
that treated by Mr. Bret Harte in one of his latest 
short stories. 

"Caleb Wright, a Story of the West" (Lothrop) is 
a good, hearty, wholesome account of a married couple 
from the East who went out West to grow up with the 
country, and in the operation made the country grow 
up with them. It is written by Mr. John Habberton, 
and shows that understanding of the inventive Amer- 
ican and his abilities in many directions which makes 
the story a criticism of life in something like Arnold's 
comprehension of the phrase. 

One of the few lads who sees life as it really is, 
without illusions, is the hero of Mr. Henry M. Hyde's 
" One Forty-Two, the Reformed Messenger Boy " 
(Stone). Told in a dialect that is distinctive from its 
free use of slang rather than from any marked vari- 
ance from the standard iu pronunciation, the sixteen 
tales in the book are vivid, picturesque, and, it may be 
worth while adding, strictly true. If not a pleasing 
picture of life in a great American city, the story has 
the merit of accuracy, and, within the limits set, of 
literary feeling and proportion. 

There is a humorous side to house-moving, for all 
Franklin's ranking it among the calamities; and this is 
brought out to the full by Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine 
in " The Van Dwellers " (J. F. Taylor & Co.). Though 
concerned with New York, the name is not derived 
from the Knickerbockers, but signifies those mortals 
who spend so mnch time in changing their domicile 
that they are said to dwell in the furniture vans which 
convey their chattels. A couple come from Oshkosh 
to the metropolis to live. They find just the place they 
have longed for. Experience proves it undesirable. 
They move on. More experience teaches the same les- 
son. After passing through all the grades of knowl- 
edge, they complete a post-graduate course and become 
"commuters," — it is so good for the children. 

Mr. H. G. Wells, the English Jules Verne, again 
challenges comparison with his prototype in scientific 
fiction by " The First Men in the Moon " (Bowen- 
Merrill). By the discovery of a substance which is as 
impervious to gravity as iron is to light, it becomes 
possible to shut off the earth's attraction from a prop- 
erly constituted hollow receptacle, which thereupon 
goes over to the moon. Though dead on the surface, 
as astronomers hold, the inmates of the receptacle find 
an abundance of intelligent folk iu the caverns that 
extend through the satellite, and these creatures are 
shaped something like insects externally but with as- 
tonishing diversities of habit and structure. We like 
M. Verne's story best. 

"The Grip of the Bookmaker" (Fenno) is a better 
book than its title. Mr. Percy White is not telling the 
story of a commonplace entanglement with a gambler, 
but the life of a young Oxford man whose father, an 
usurer and seller of chances on the turf, has determined 
to make a gentleman of him, though he still forces him 
into constant companionship. The young man loves 
above his father's station, as a matter of course, and his 
trials are spiritual in good part and very real.

Old Holland '^^® quaintness and picturesqueness 

in picture of Holland, so long as they endure, 

and text. ^jj| form a tempting subject for 

pencil and brush, and a charming pleasure-ground 
for the still larger class of sojourners in quest of 
the artistic. Messrs. Boughton and Abbey, a dozen 
years ago, indulged in a "Sketching Ramble in 
Holland "; and nothing that has appeared since has 
equalled their account in good-humoured apprecia- 
tion of the Dutchman and his country. The volume 
with the title " Old Dutch Towns and Villages of 
the Zuider Zee" (Lippincott), which has for the 
writer of the text Mr. W. J. Tuyn and for its illus- 
trators Messrs. Nieuwenkamp and Veldheer, is far 
more sumptuous in appearance, but can hardly be 
said to convey the charm of its predecessor. The 
text, though it brings to light many interesting bits 
of antiquarian lore, is little more than a collection 
of notes setting forth pertinent information in re- 
gard to the subjects of the illustrations. It is for 
the latter that the work will be examined by those 
interested in artistic Holland. It can hardly be 
said that the artists' severe, poster-like treatment 
of the old Dutch architectural lines, mellowed and 
even decrepit with age, at all carries with it the 
feeling which the originals inspire. The intense 
conventionalization of black and white that is cul- 
tivated by artists who come close up to their sub- 
jects seems decidedly inappropriate for old Holland, 
which very properly demands a modest share of the 
enchantment of distance. The scenes chosen are, 
on the whole, typical and pleasingly reminiscent. 
The omission of the entire east coast of the Zuider 
Zee detracts from the comprehensiveness of the 
work and deprives the artist of some choice material, 
such as may be found in Franeker, Harlingen, 
Workum, Hindelopen, and several other cherished 
embodiments of departed glory. The volume will 
be valued by those to whom scenes quaint and Dutch 
have a peculiar fascination ; but it can hardly be 
said to fill the very real need for an adequate and 
sympathetic account of what Holland offers to the 
artist and the tourist. 



In 1894, Professor J. F. McCardy 
l:n:r;ri «* *^« university of Toronto issued 

the first volume of his " History, 
Prophecy, and the Monuments" (Macmillan). In 
1896, the second volume appeared, carrying the 
history down to the fall of Nineveh in 606 B. C. 
After nearly five years we have the third and con- 
cluding volume, which closes with the end of the 
Babylonian exile. The whole series is a remarkable 
presentation of Semitic history previous to and con- 
temporaneous with the writers and literature of the 
Old Testament down to the fall of Babylon. More 
than this, it weaves together both the contempo- 
raneous and Old Testament records in such a man- 
ner as to present the facts in their interrelations. 
The work is thus a kind of historical commentary 



on the Old Testament writings down through the 
Second Isaiah, or to 538 B. C. This third volume 
is divided into three books : Book IX. treats of 
" Hebrews and Egyptians "; Book X., of " Hebrews 
and Chald»ans"; and Book XL, of "Hebrews, 
Chaldseans, and Persians." The larger part of the 
volume is a discussion of historical questions and 
material. But the author presents two chapters of 
more than ordinary interest : " Deuteronomy and 
Hebrew Literature " (pp. 19-80), and " Religion 
and Morals " (pp. 81-125). In the first of these, 
the author specifies the beginnings and growth of 
Hebrew literature. He discusses the origin of 
writing, and even the source of the alphabet now in 
use — showing that the Phoenicians probably did 
not get their alphabet in Egypt. In tracing the 
origin of Hebrew literature, the author has reached 
grounds quite surprising to most Old Testament 
scholars. The Pentateuch is composed of the dif- 
ferent documents now commonly found there by 
Old Testament scholars. Belief in David's Psalms 
is "impossible" (p. 51). Even Psalm 18 contains 
a theophany (vss. 7-17) " to which David and his 
age were incompetent." The book of Deuteronomy, 
" found " at the time of Josiah, was the chief source 
of inspiration in the reformation inaugurated by 
that ruler. The chapter discussing the " religion 
and morals " of Israel is full of interesting facts 
regarding the prevalence and power of religion 
among the Israelites during the successive ages of 
their history. The remaining chapters of the vol- 
ume are replete with the results of a careful and 
discriminating scholarship, fully abreast of the latest 
discoveries in archaeological fields touching the Old 
Testament. The volume is concluded by indices to 
the complete series, but we have no maps on which 
to trace out the momentous history pictured in 
these full volumes. 



The study and 
criticism of 
Italian art. 



Mr. Bernhard Berenson's latest 
work, " The Study and Criticism of 
Italian Art" (Macmillan), is a col- 
lection of seven essays written at intervals during a 
period of ten years, but all having a common pur- 
pose — to illustrate a method of studying the his- 
tory of art more abstractly than it has been studied, 
and freed as much as possible from entangling 
irrelevahcies of personal anecdote and the sterile 
prosings of so-called connoisseurs. The world's art, 
he urges, should be studied as independently of all 
documents as is the world's fauna or the world's flora. 
Documents should be consulted chiefly for mere 
convenience of naming. The most striking of the 
present essays is one which applies this method to 
certain pictures hitherto variously ascribed to either 
one of the Lippis, to Botticelli, or to Ghirlandajo. 
In these pictures, not only their characteristics in 
common but their differences from each of th© 
others seem to Mr. Berenson a sufficient warrant 
for constructing a new artistic personality, — prob- 
ably a follower of Sandro Botticelli, whom he 
names " Amico di Sandro." Even the famous 



1901.]

<* Bella Simonetta " of the Pitti, ascribed to Botti- 
celli by 80 many generations, is taken away from 
him and given to " Amico," on the ground that 
" no serious critic who looks at the gawkiness of the 
figure and the timidity of the execution will think 
of Sandro as the real author"; whereas certain 
merits — drawing, folds, lighting and perspective 
of the o])ening — are distinguishing merits of 
*' Amico." By similar processes of comparison, 
Filippino loses and '• Amico " gains several pictures ; 
the general conclusion being that this newly discov- 
ered personality was artistically neither so deep nor 
so gifted as Botticelli, more fascinating but not so 
serious as Filippino Lippi. Each of the essays is 
illustrated by fine and clear full-page copies of 
great paintings, forty-three in all ; and text and 
pictures combine to make this one of the most at- 
tractive art-books of the year. 



Agmidelo 
the byyeayt 
o/ Surrey. 



Surrey is the subject of the new vol- 
ume in Dent's " County Guides " 
series (Macmillan). Unlike the tra- 
ditional guide-book, it makes delightful reading for 
the stay-at-home; and any tourist who gets hold 
of it will certainly steal a day or so from London 
highways to make some of what its author felicit- 
ously calls its *^ intimate excursions " along the by- 
paths of Surrey County. The book is in three 
parts, of which the first and most important deals 
with the story and scenery of the county, grouping 
its detail in seven itineraries. The author, Mr. 
Jerrold, is apparently an enthusiastic cyclist and 
pedestrian, a lover of scenery, and finely apprecia- 
tive of the literary and historic associations of the 
county whose quaint chroniclers are all his friends. 
With equal zest — and always in charming English 
— he tells us of the yew-lined Pilgrims' Way, of 
the Thames meadows where Shelley lounged and 
wrote " Alastor," of the castles visited by Elizabeth 
in her stately summer progresses, or of Moor Park 
where Swift flirted with Stella and learned of 
William III. how to cut asparagus. Then the 
author drops a hint to the cyclist to avoid a rut- 
ted bit of road, or calls attention to a picturesque 
little coppice with an alluring foot-path through it ; 
so that the reader who finds nothing to interest him 
must indeed be difficult to please. The second part 
of the book consists of special articles upon the bird 
life, flowers, moths and butterflies, geological for- 
mations, and cycling tours of Surrey ; while the 
third contains a gazetteer of the county. Maps and 
illustrations add much to the interest and practical 
value of the book, which is attractively bound in 
flexible cloth covers. 



Bote to build 
a Church. 



That there is need in this country 
for expert information on the subject 
of ecclesiastical architecture, reduced 
to such form that it can be used practically by 
church builders, one has but to take a cursory view 
of our church buildings to determine. But it is 
doubtful if Mr. Ralph Adams Cram's " Church 



Building, a Study of the Principles of Architecture 
in their Relation to the Church " (Small, Maynard 
& Co.), will fill any such " long-felt want." It is 
pitched in too high a key to be of much practical 
service to those who are forced to face the problems 
of church building. It is a beautiful book, and so 
abundantly illustrated (there are 125 illustrations 
besides frontispiece and vignettes) that one might 
almost " read the book by looking at the pictures "; 
and such a process would not be without profit or 
the acquisition of new ideas. But after the beauty 
of the typography has impelled one to pursue the 
letter-press, one feels that he finds therein but one 
man's ideas, and that, if it were desired to build 
any of the churches therein recommended, but one 
architect could be found who could design it. The 
book presents high ideals, — which is quite right; 
but where, under the conditions of life existing in 
this country, would it be wise or possible to build 
the style of " Country Chapel " (costing $5. 000 to 
$10,000) which is here recommended ? And the 
author's "Village Church" (costing S30,000) 
seems misplaced in a small town, as things are in 
America. The author's dogmatism is likely to be 
repellant to many who would in an exigency turn 
to this book for help, and his style is flippant in 
some cases and likely to be misunderstood. His 
use of such terms as "wicked" and "vicious," in 
connection with things pertaining to the church, 
brings them in the category of slang. The book is 
a collection of articles recently published serially in 
a religious periodical, and in preparing them for 
republication the author has not quite given them 
that quality of permanence which should differen- 
tiate a book from a magazine polemic. 

"Deafness and Cheerfulness" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.), by the Rev. A. W. 
Jackson (who will be remembered as 
Dr. Martineau's biographer), cannot fail to bring 
comfort and strength to those dwellers in a world 
of silence, more or less complete, who have ceased 
to invoke the aurist's aid and now turn to the phy- 
sician of the soul for such balm as he may have to 
offer. Himself a sufferer, and an uncomplaining 
one, the writer deprecates any excess of tenderness 
from those about him. " I would rather," he says, 
" have them take it for granted that, though the 
way of suffering is appointed me, there is yet some 
toughness in my fibre, that I can take the natural 
discomforts of my infirmity with a reasonable de- 
gree of equanimity." He compares the deaf and 
the blind, and, judging from personal observation, 
thinks the latter the happier, as they certainly are 
the more fortunate in eliciting sympathy. Distract- 
ing head noises harass the deaf, as a rule, which 
may partly explain the apparently greater serenity 
of the blind. The chapter on " The Pathos of 
Deafness " is enlivened with anecdotes, amusing as 
well as pathetic. It is of interest to learn, from a 
noted aurist's experience, that more than sixty per 
cent of an average community are below the normal

in hearing power — generally without consciousness 
of their defect. Mr. Jackson urges the deaf frankly 
to acknowledge their infirmity, to use an ear- 
trumpet, and, most important of all, to learn lip- 
reading if possible. The book was written, as we 
are in a position to know, from an intense desire on 
the author's part to do something for those who suf- 
fer as he has suffered, and is from beginning to end 
a reflection of his own experience. It thus appeals 
with conviction to all readers, and especially to the 
deaf. Both practical and spiritual is its lesson, 
manliness and courage its dominant note. 

Felix Reville Brunot, the subject of 
iitiri^ti^itum. an appreciative memoir by Dean 

Slattery, of Faribault, Minn., was a 
good man and a devout Episcopalian, whose life 
touched closely that of the nation, particularly dur- 
ing the troublous period of the Civil War, and 
subsequently in dealing with the Indians and in 
attempting a solution of the Indian question. Mr. 
Brunot was a successful business man of ample 
fortune, and during the Civil War he gave largely 
of his means to aid the Union cause and to mini- 
mize the sufferings of the brave boys in the field. 
Perhaps Mr. Brunot will be longest and most grate- 
fully remembered for his ef&eient labors among the 
Indians, and especially for his services as presi- 
dent and a member of the Board of Indian Com- 
missioners. It was his constant purpose to see that 
the Indian agents did their duty by the poor red 
men in their keeping. This was a herculean task ; 
for practically all the government's agents had pur- 
sued an almost uniform policy of looting the Indians 
of that which was allotted to them. But most of 
all, Mr. Brunot pursued a policy of peace and edu- 
cation among the Indians. And this policy was suc- 
cessful in a marked degree. He was able to prove 
to any fair-minded person that General Sheridan's 
terse statement that "the only good Indian is a 
dead Indian " was not true. The absolute unsel- 
fishness and deep religious convictions of the sub- 
ject of the memoir are marked features of the 
book. Perhaps it is quite natural that this should 
be so, coming, as it does, from one of his own faith, 
and an admirer. The book contains several excel- 
lent illustrations, and a map of the Indian reser 
vations in 1874. (Longmans, Green, & Co.). 

There could not well be a more ge- 
naiureiovert. "^*^ *°*^ kindly student of the bird 

world than Mr. Bradford Torrey 
shows himself to be in the beautiful little volume en- 
titled "Footing it in Franconia" ( Houghton, Mifl3.in 
& Co.), a series of nine essays recounting the au- 
thor's experiences during vacation rambles through 
the woods and over the hills of Franconia. It may 
be well to state that the Franconia in the case is 
neither a duchy nor a district in Germany, as the 
reader outside of New England might suppose, but 
a delightful region in Grafton County, New Hamp- 
shire. The bird-visitors to Franconia, and the 



author's efforts to catch sight of some of the rarer 
among them, are the chief themes of the essays, 
which are, however, quite informal, even pleas- 
antly rambling in manner, and in no sense constitute 
a " loird book." It is the lover of birds, and the 
wild woods and hillside nooks which they most fre- 
quent, rather than the professional student of birds, 
who speaks in these essays. Indeed, it is clear 
that the author could no more kill a bird for the 
purpose of classifying or mounting it than he could 
kill a human being for that purpose. The reader 
who is not a bird enthusiast, however, need hardly 
fear that the book will bore him, since it is written 
in a refined and very pleasant style. Moreover, a 
mild and engaging humor, not so obvious or insist- 
ent as to interfere with the main purpose, is dif- 
fused throughout, and helps the book to escape 
tediousness — a fault which the general reader may 
feel is not always avoided by some otherwise admir- 
able nature books. It is not too much to say that 
"Footing it in Franconia" is a very good book in 
a fine if not a very widely popular kind, as popu- 
larity is measured in these days. 

In "An Introduction to Psychology" 
Anewtexi-book (Macmillan), Miss Mary W. Calk- 

of psychology. V -or c "du-i u j 

ins, Professor ot Philosophy and 

Psychology in Wellesley College, has added a note- 
worthy volume to the existing aids to the teaching 
of Psychology. The work represents the results of 
the author's teaching experience, and conveys a 
vital sense of close-range instruction. It embodies 
no particularly novel or unusual features, but pre- 
sents a very comprehensive range of psychological 
topics with lucidity and interest and with apprecia- 
tion of the bearings of recent discussion and research. 
The inclusion of chapters upon Comparative and 
upon Abnormal Psychology is a praiseworthy step ; 
as is also the constant illustration of psychological 
principles by direct reference to experiences of every- 
day life. The value of a text-book, apart from its 
readability, has come to lie more and more in its 
adaptability to the peculiar needs of courses, and to 
the points of emphasis maintained by instructors. 
Those who share Miss Calkins's views of the gen- 
eral plan and scope of a collegiate course in Psy- 
chology will find in her book direct aid and much 
indirect stimulus. It seems not inappropriate to 
note in connection with this contribution, that it is 
the first text-book in Psychology written by a 
woman ; that this distinction should be reserved for 
America argues well for the cause of American 
education. 



The Spinster's 
Own Book. 



The unappropriated blessings of the 
earth need not suffer for the conso- 
lations of literature, when such a work 
as Miss Myrtle Reed's " Spinster Book " (Putnam) 
is to be had. To be sure, nine-tenths of the volume 
is about love and marriage ; but in giving such 
preponderance to those subjects, the author only 
proves her intimate knowledge of the spinster heart. 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

The last chapter, which encourages every singly 
blessed woman to hope that the belated Prince noay 
yet arrive, is especially sympathetic and consoling. 
But perhaps the greatest charm of the work is that 
the writer has so far lived up to the motto " Not 
for ourselves " — which all spinsters have apparent- 
ly adopted toward man — as to extend it to books 
also, even her own. Her chapters will consequently 
be a delight not only to the " unattached " but to 
everyone. The wedded in every degree of bliss, 
the widowed and the widowered as well as the un- 
wedded in every grade of approach to the confirm- 
ed state — which it seems spinsters never reach — 
will find something here to learn and to laugh at, 
about themselves and about each other. With a 
great fund of shrewdness and wit, and no little 
delicate sentiment, Miss Reed has explored the 
matrimonial side of man's vanity and man's tender- 
ness, of woman's folly and woman's virtue. Her 
style is a little too pretensely Emersonian, and the 
brittle and unwelded sentences sometimes grow 
monotonous. Nor has she always escaped the 
temptations of the epigrammatic to sound more 
cynical than they are, and to appear anxious to say 
clever things. But underneath these few surface 
faults there is much genuine "Stardust" — worthy 
to be found and enjoyed by men, women, and 
spinsters. 

Never have the Jesuits been so 
numerous and prosperous in En- 
gland as now, with their seven col- 
leges, their numerous churches, and their two hun- 
dred and fifty fathers engaged in active work, be- 
sides lay brothers and those under training and 
absent on foreign missions. But the outlook was 
decidedly dreary for them when the first emissa- 
ries of the Society courageously landed on British 
soil in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Rev. Ethel- 
red L. Taunton's painstaking " History of the Jesu- 
its in England" (Lippincott) fills acceptably a gap 
in the voluminous annals of the Society of Jesus. 
But the author seems to underrate the difficulty of 
the historian's ta^k when he says, in closing his 
preface : " In these days when archives are open to 
all, an author can proceed with a firm and sure 
hand in unraveling the records of the past." This 
jaunty attitude is hardly the one to be assumed, 
we should think, by a writer who has to handle a 
perplexing topic like the Gunpowder Plot, which 
still baffles the ablest historians. In point of style, 
this bulky volume can scarcely be said to possess 
the fascination of romance. Perhaps it is not pos- 
sible, or indeed desirable, that it should.

A lavD book 
Jor vomen. 



" Woman and the Law " (Century 
Co.) is a useful compilation by Prof. 
George James Bayles, of Columbia 
University. It contains in comparatively little 
space, a discussion of the legal condition of woman- 
kind in America. The treatment is popular, in the 
sense of not being technical, and is not uninterest- 



ing, when the nature of the information given is 
taken into account. Marriage, divorce, and ali- 
mony take up the first of the three parts, and here 
the seeker after knowledge can obtain it on points 
as widely removed as the " Plural Marriages of the 
Mormons" and the "Change of Name after Di- 
vorce." Less space is given to woman in connection 
with business but the discussion is still thorough, 
and few questions could be propounded for which 
an answer is not at hand. Such topics as feminine 
citizenship, the suffrage, the appearance of women 
in court as attorneys or as witnesses, and the em- 
ployment and protection of women, take up the 
last part. Throughout, the differences in the reg- 
ulations of the several States is made clear ; and 
the value of the work is enhanced by a preliminary 
essay on " The Study of Law for Women," by 
Professor I. F. Russell. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Century Co. publish this year five new volumes 
of " Century Classics." " The Autobiography of Ben- 
jamin Franklin " has an essay by Professor Woodrow 
Wilson, " Tales by Edgar Allen Poe " are introduced 
by Mr. H. W. Mabie, while Ruskin's " Sesame and 
Lilies " and " The Crown of Wild Olives," which are 
put into a volume together, have no prefatory matter 
save the author's own. " Hypatia," in two volumes, 
completes this list, and has a critical foreword by Mr. 
Edmund Gosse. 

"The Government of the American People," by 
Messrs. Frank Strong and Joseph Sbafer, both of the 
University of Oregon, is a recent educational publica- 
tion of Messrs. Houghton, Mi£Bin & Co. It is suited 
for the higher grades of the grammar school or for 
lower grades of the high school. Among the many re- 
cent text-books of this subject for young students, this 
seems to us one of the very best. It is logical in its 
presentation, and its plan is such as to provide a con- 
tinuous narrative, from the government of the early 
towns and counties down to the government of the 
Federal Constitution. Although a small book, it con- 
tains much matter, and, what is still better, puts the 
student on the track of further information and inves- 
tigation. 

The following modern language texts have recently 
appeared: "Germany and the Germans " (being Herr 
P. D. Fischer's " Betrachtungen Fines in Deutschland

The " Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin " is pub- 
lished as a " Pocket Classic," for use in schools, by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Beginning with the November number the well- 
known " English Illustrated Magazine " will be pub- 
lished by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin of London. 

Messrs. Benj. H. Sanborn & Co. announce for publi- 
cation in January a new Classical and Historical Atlas, 
consisting of some thirty carefully-executed maps. 

«• A Primer of Political Economy," by Mr. S. T. 
Wood, is a recent publication of the Macmillan Co. It 
is a very small book indeed, but it contains the essen- 
tials. 

" Tony Butler " and " The Fortunes of Glencore " are 
two new volumes in the Standard library edition of 
Charles Lever's novels published by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. 

"The Story of Little Nell," extracted from the 
" Old Curiosity Shop," and edited for school purposes

Arthur and his Court," retold in simple English by 
Miss Frances Nimmo Greene. 

" The Epigraphical Evidence for the Reigns of Ves- 
pasian and Titus," by Mr. Homer Curtis Newton, is 
one of the " Cornell Studies in Classical Philology," 
published by the Macmillan Co. 

Miss Louisa Parr's " Dorothy Fox," published by the 
Messrs. Lippincott, provides an acceptable reprint, with 
illustrations, of one of the most popular novels for 
feminine readers of the past generation. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. are the publishers of 
" An Elementary French Reader," with notes and vo- 
cabulary, prepared by Mr. Gaston Douay. Each au- 
thor represented is made the subject of a biographical 
note, which is an excellent idea. 

" England," by Mrs. Frederick Boaz, and " America," 
by Miss Mary Ford, are two small volumes of history 
for children, just published by Mr. Thomas Whittaker. 
They are neatly printed, and the former of the two 
volumes has a number of illustrations. 

Mr. William S. Lord, Evanston, is the publisher of 
a tasteful booklet which contains "The Passing of 
Mother's Portrait," a story of gentle albeit satirical 
humor, by Mr. Roswell Field. The story appeared in 
" The Atlantic Monthly," but in an abridged form, a 
few months ago. 

Nothing could well be prettier, daintier, or in any way 
more attractive than the new " Temple " edition of the 
"Bronte Sisters," with the Dent-Macmillan guaranty 
of careful editing and textual accuracy. There are 
twelve volumes in the set, which includes one volume 
of poems. Each volume has a frontispiece illustration. 
The set makes an ideal holiday gift. 

The interesting announcement of a complete " Vario- 
rum and Definitive Edition" of the works of Edward 
FitzGerald is made by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
The edition will comprise seven large volumes, with 
a full bibliography and introductory matter by Mr. 
George Bentham, and a preface by Mr. Edmund Gosse. 
The manufacture of the work has been entrusted to 
the Merry mount Press. 



Pope's " The Rape of the Lock," with Aubrey Beards- 
ley's illustrations, forms the latest volume in the 
"Flowers of Parnassus " series, published by Mr. John

these characteristic specimens in so convenient and in- 
expensive an edition. 

The " Artistic Craft Series," a collection of illus- 
trated technical handbooks, is announced by Messrs. 
D. Appleton & Co. Each craft will be dealt with by 
an expert qualified to speak with authority on design 
as well as on workmanship. The series is to be in- 
augurated with a volume by Mr. Douglas Cockerell on 
" The Craft of Bookbinding, and the Preservation of 
Books." 

About one hundred short speeches selected for prac- 
tice in declamation are brought together in Mr. A. 
Howry Espenshade's " Forensic Declamations," just 
published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. The 
selections cover a wide range of authors and subjects, 
from Burke to Mr. W. J. Bryan, from the civilizing in- 
fluence of Athens according to Macaulay, down to the 
spoils system according to Mr. Carl Shurz. We are 
glad to commend this little book. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. have sent us five new 
volumes of their " Silver Series of English and Ameri-

Mr. Charles F. Lummis, editor of " The Land of 
Sunshine," makes the interesting announcement that 
the magazine, beginning next January, will be enlarged 
to " standard magazine size," its scope broadened to 
take in the entire region of the Pacific coast, and its 
title changed to " Out West." We not only wish the 
enterprise success in its enlarged venture, but we feel 
quite confident that it will be successful. The peri- 
odical already has a considerable constituency, and 
needs only to become better known to gain a much 
larger following.

BOOKS FOR 

THE LAST OF THE KNICKERBOCKERS 

By Herman K. Viele, author of "The Inn of the Silver Moon." i2mo., cloth^ $i-50. A 
novel of to-day, with the principal scenes laid in New York City. The heroine of Mr. Viele's 
novel is one of the most distinct literal^ creations which has appeared in a number of years, and 
the book will have a ready sale among the author's large following. 

ANIMALS 

By Wallace Rice. Illustrated in color. Octavo, cloth, $2.00 net. A book which describes for 
both old and young the characteristics and habits of wild animals in a most entertaining and 
breezy way. It makes them alive and vivid to the imagination. One of the chief features of 
the book is the splendid collection of animal portraits. These illustrations are included in 
the volume by an arrangement with the Nature Study Co., who furnished the illustrations for 
"Bird Neighbors." 

THE INDIANS OF TO-DAY 

By George Bird Grinnell. With fifty full-page portraits of the most famous Chiefs, po, 
$^.00. There is hardly a feature of Indian life and history which is not taken up and discussed 
by one who has made the matter a life study, and who knows. It required years to secure the 
data from which the work is written. As an addition to libraries of Americana, the volume is 
indispensable. The book is illustrated with a remarkable series of photographs, taken by Mr. 
F. A. Rinehart during the Congress of Indians at the Omaha Exposition. 

THE LIFE OF WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY 

By Lewis Melville. With portraits, fac simile of handwriting, and several drawings, many now 
printed for the first time. In two volumes, demy 8vo, cloth, gilt, $7.50. Although five and thirty 
years have passed since his death, until now there has never been published a life of Thackeray 
which has had any pretentions to finality. The present work has been written to fill this void 
in the literary history of the century. It is a complete record of the career of the great novelist, 
and throws many new lights upon his private as well as his public life. Thackeray is pre- 
sented as novelist, poet, artist, and art critic, and his friendships and tastes are recorded. 

THE COMPLETE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE 

Newly collected, edited, and for the first time revised after the author's final manuscript corrections, 
by Edmund Clarence Stedman and George Edward Woodberry, with many portraits, fac similes, 
and pictures by Albert Edward Sterner. This is the only complete edition of Poe's works. The 
entire writings have been revised ; innumerable errors have been corrected ; quotations have been 
verified, and the work now stands — for the first time — as Poe wished it to stand. The editors 
contribute a memoir, critical introductions, and notes; the variorum texts are given and new 
matter has been added. The portraits include several which have never appeared in book form 
before, and the printing has been carefully done at the University Press, Cambridge, on specially 
made deckle-edged paper. In fine, the edition aims to be definitive, and is intended alike for the 
librarian, the student, and the book lover. The ten volumes, cloth, together in a box, $1^.00 net; 
half-crushed levant, ten volumes, $/f.o.oo net, or the five volumes of tales, $20.00 a set.

QRAUSTARK: The Story of a Love Behind a Throne 

By George Barr McCutcheon. izmo^ cloth^ $1-50. GRAUSTARK is the first book of a 
new author. GRAUSTARK is already in its one hundred and tenth thousand. GRAUSTARK 
is to-day the fourth best selling book in the United States. GRAUSTARK is to-day the best 
selling book in the Dominion of Canada, and a large edition has been placed in Great Britain. 
GRAUSTARK has been dramatized for Miss Mary Mannering, and will be produced in the 
United States in the Autumn. GRAUSTARK has been dramatized for Miss Julia Neilson, 
who will produce it in England in the Autumn. 

TWO GENTLEMEN IN TOURAINE 

By Richard Sudbury. 8vo^ cloth^ illustrated^ $3-50- A delightful account of the wanderings 
of an American gentleman and a member of the French nobility through the historical chateaux 
of France. These buildings arc to be classed among the great architectural achievements of the 
world ; and the author has given a lightness and variety to his narrative which are unusual in 
books of this kind. He gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the famous people 
who lived in them, and admirable descriptions of the country. 

SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN 

His life story, with letters, reminiscences, and many illustrations, by Arthur Lawrence. The 
authorized biography of the great composer. Prepared under his personal supervision and revised 
by him in proof. It contains many of his letters^ and much intimate personal matter of great interest. 
8vo^ cloth^ $J.SO. The volume, fully illustrated as it is with letters, portraits, and musical 
scores, is an ideal gift for anyone interested in music. The " Gilbert and Sullivan " operas have 
such a firm place on the stage of our time that a close acquaintance with one of their authors 
cannot fail to appeal to a large part of the public. 



THE LOVE OF AN UNCROWNED QUEEN 

An important work by W. H. Wilkins, the author of " The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton." 
Sophie Dorothea, Consort of George L, and her Correspondence with Philip Christopher, Count 
Konigsmarck (now first published from the originals). A new edition, complete in one volume. 
8vo, $2.00 net. " Now that the public curiosity aroused by ' An Englishwoman's Love Letters ' 
has been somewhat satiated, we should like to call attention to a work which is more deserving 
in the interest of that world that loves a lover. Some time ago Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. 
published a book entitled * The Love of an Uncrowned Queen,* which for pure passion and 
genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest the fictitious and artificial ' letters ' 
said to be the work of Mr. Laurence Housman. Nothing could be more significant of the 
tyranny of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane 
regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An English- 
woman's Love Letters' on the one hand, and the utter lack of interest in 'The Love of an 
Uncrowned Queen ' on the other." — The New York Times Saturday Review.

THE LIFE OF 

Robert Louis Stevenson 



The New York Times 

Saturday Review 

says: 

"It seems clear that Mr. 
Balfour's work could scarcely 
have been done better. The 
volumes, moreover, contain 
much entirely new matter. 

" His entire sympathy with 
his subject, never degenerating 
into mere hero worship, makes 
his concluding chapter of some 
thirty pages — • R. L. S.' — 
one of the most fascinating 
portions ot an altogether fas- 
cinating book." 



By GRAHAM BALFOUR 

With valuable autobiographical mat- 
ter never published elsewhere; also 
unpublished portraits of Mr. and Mrs. 
Stevenson. 



Its Special Purposes 

pvESIGNED as a record of Steven- 
*~^ son's career and a study of the 
development of his character. It 
aims to record the successive expres- 
sions of his most varied and fascinating 
personality. Also specially intended 
as a study in portraiture, a supplement 
to the Letters as they are a supplement 
to the published works of the author. 
Treats essentially of Stevenson the 
man. 

In tiuo 'volumes, uniform nvith 'the 
Letters, ^oo pages, S^.oo net [postage 
JO cents). 



Tlie Spectator (London) 
says: 

"The latter half of Mr. 
Balfour's second volume will 
always be indispensable to any 
judgment of Stevenson, for 
Mr. Balfour was closely asso- 
ciated with, and has excellently 
described, the man in what was 
almost a different incarnation. " 

Literature (London) 
says: 

"Mr. Graham Balfour's life 
of his famous cousin is more 
than adequate, if one may say 
so; it is a dignified, scholarly, 
frank, and at the same time 
very loving piece of work, 
which is wholly worthy of its 
subject."

dents in addition to their intrinsic interest, dramatic, humorous, or 
what not, of high value for the light they throw upon the traits of the 
man — his kindliness, his sweetness, his love of practical jokes and 
all kinds of fun, his taste for books, his hatred of shams and pretense, 
his interest in politics and the theatre, his affection for children, etc.

FICTION OF AN UNUSUAL TYPE 
A T rare intervals the routine prcxluction of love stories and 
'^ romantic novels is varied by the appearance of a book that 
compels attention on account of its genuine inspiration and 
power. Mr. Hermon Lee Ensign's " Lady Lee and Other Animal 
Stories" is a book of this kind. They are true stories of animal 
intelligence and heroism, and their most appealing charm is due 
to the tenderness and affection with which they are written. 
There are a number of beautiful illustrations in photogravure. 
(Price $2.00.) No one has been able to present so successfully 
the atmosphere of Modem Greece as Mr. George Horton, and 
his latest stor)% "The Tempting of Father Anthony," has 
achieved the popularity which is the natural right of any book 
that conducts its readers away from the beaten path. "As 
original and witty as Don Quixote," one reviewer writes, " and 
delightfully simple and idyllic." (Illustrated, price $1.25.) 

NEW ROMANTIC NOVELS 

pOR some readers, however, nothing takes the place of dra- 
•*■ matic excitement and the clash of swords. Miss Mary Imlay 
Taylor's new story of Colonial Massachusetts has plenty of the 
former, for the heroine of " Anne Scarlett " has been wrongfully 
accused of witchcraft, and the story of her peril and final release 
is one of absorbing interest. (Price $1.25.) Another romantic 
novel with all the elements of popularity is " A Parfit Gentil 
Knight," by Charlton Andrews. The " parfit gentil knight " 
in this case is a young Huguenot, and there are enough deeds of 
chivalry and daring to satisfy the most exacting admirer of 
romance. (Illustrated, price $1.50.) 

FOR THE CONNOISSEUR 
"IXriTH the increasing interest in the study and collection of 
fine rugs has come a demand for more available and 
practical literature on the subject. Unfortunately the most use- 
ful books have been the most expensive. This demand for a 
practical and easily understood reference book has led to the

practical value, (Price, $5,00 net.) 

POPULAR FICTION AND STORIES 

'T'HE popular " Tales from Foreign Lands" series has received 
a recent addition in " Nanna : A Tale of Danish Love," by 
Holger Drachmann, the greatest of living Scandinavian poets. 
It is a beautiful love-idyll from the Northern Sea, and a volume 
of most unusual literary charm. (Price, $1.00.) The recent 
success of Mrs. Catherwood has caused a demand for her earlier 
books, and a new edition of her first popular book, " The Story 
of Tonty," in a larger form, and with a new introduction by the 
author, has just been published. (Price, $1.25".) Especially 
acceptable gift books by reason of the character of their subjects 
and their dainty attractive appearance are " As a Falling Star," 
by Eleanor Gaylord Phelps, and " Lincoln's First Love," by 
Carrie Douglas Wright (each, with frontispiece, $1.00). Five 
short stories of unusual power are contained in "The Battle 
Invisible," by Eleanor C. Reed, whose delineation of New Eng- 
land character has been favorably compared with that of Mary 
Wilkins. (Price, $1.25.) Equally strong in local color are the 
" Tennessee Sketches" of Louise Preston Looney. (Price, $1.00.) 

FOR YOUNGER READERS 

A/TISS MARGUERITE BOUVET has a large circle of en- 
thusiastic young admirers who consider a new book from 
her pen an event of great importance. They will not be disap- 
pointed in "Bernardo and Laurette," the story of two little 
people of the Alps. It is a lively account of their adventures on a 
long tramp from Alsace to Savoy, seeking a home. The pictures 
are by Helen Maitland Armstrong, who has been unusually suc- 
cessful in the illustration of Miss Bouvet's stories, (Price, $1.00 
net.) Miss Armstrong has also made the drawings for "Swedish 
Fairy Tales," a fairy book by Anna Wahlenberg. The familiar 
figures all appear — princes, goblins, brownies, and princesses —

but in each story there is an original touch that makes the book 
different from any that have come before. (Price, $1.00 net) 
Another book which has been equally fortunate in its illustrarion 
is " Margot : The Court Shoemaker's Daughter." The author, 
Millicent E. Mann, has realized that young people enjoy histori- 
cal romance quite as much as their elders, and in " Margot " the 
youthful heroine has many adventures on account of her father's 
Huguenot faith. The artistic binding and the notable originahty 
of the pictures, by Troy and Margaret Kinney, complete one of 
the most attractive juveniles of the season. (Price, $1.00 net) 

AN AMUSING AND FANTASTIC BOOK 
'VTOTHING seems to delight young readers more than stories 
of animals endowed with conversational powers. Mr. 
George W. Bateman has discovered among East African folk- 
lore some rare material of this kind which he has made into a 
remarkably diverting book called " Zanzibar Tales." There are 
a number of exceedingly clever illustrations by Mr. Walter 
Bobbett, and the book is likely to make a sensation in the world 
of juvenile Hterature. (Price, $1.00 net) Another fairy book 
is " Stories of Enchantment," by Jane P. Myers. These are twelve 
delightfully simple and direct little stories intended for children 
of ten years or so. (Illustrated, price $1.00 net) 

FOR GIRLS AND BOYS 

N abrupt contrast to these imaginative tales is "Maggie 
McLanehan," by Miss GuUelma Zollinger. It is an every- 
day story of a young Irish girl who shows remarkable pluck and 
good judgment in earning her own living. (Illustrated, $ 1.00 net) 
The story is written in the same spirit as Miss ZolUngef s previous 
book, " The Widow O'Callaghan's Boys " which has achieved a 
wide success and become one of the standard works of juvenile 
fiction (illustrated, $1.25). Although Mr. Byron A. Duim's 
new book "From Atlanta to the Sea" is intended for readers 
of all ages, the American boys who have enjoyed the "Young 
Kentuckians " series will be interested to know that in this volume 
the career of Fred Shackleford is brought to an interesting and 
happy termination. (Illustrated, price $1.25.)

Monopolies: Past and Present 

An Introductory Study, by 
JAMES EDWARD LE ROSSIQNOL, Ph.D. 

"In view of the rapid multiplication of books on 
the subject of monopoly, one is inclined to regard a 
new one with considerable dismay, as being in all 
likelihood only a repetition of the familiar hysterical 
shriekings against trusts, or the equally extreme denun- 
ciations of all who doubt the advantages of our latest 
form of industrial organization. The volume by Dr. 
Le Rossignol belongs, however, to neither of these 
groups. It is, on the contrary, a fair, scholarly pre- 
sentation of the history of monopoly." 

— Neiv York Commercial Advertiser. 
Price, $1.25. 



The Jew in London 

A Study of Racial Character and Present-Day 
Conditions, by 

C. RUSSELL and H. S. LEWIS. 

{Introduction by Canon Bamett; Preface by James Bryce) 

" A calm, unbiased discussion of a problem which 
has a parallel side in this country. Its good temper, 
candor, and penetration predispose the reader to the 
same state of mind. The volume will do much to 
bring about a clearer and fuller apprehension of the 
difficulties which beset native and alien."

The French Revolution and Modern French Socialism 

A Comparative Study of Principles and Doctrines, by 
JESSICA PEIXOTO, Ph.D. 

"This study will commend itself to students of economics and to thorough-going readers 
who prefer to trace principles back to original sources. The book seeks neither to further 
nor retard any ism ; it confines itself to an analysis of the great French upheaval of a century 
ago, and the resultant creed which has exerted so wide an effect upon history." Price, $1.50. 



Municipal Monopolies 

Public Regulation and Public Own- 
ership of Utilities Contrasted, by 
EDWARD W, BEMIS 
and others. 
••By all odds the most important 
book on municipal matters that has 
appeared since Dr. Albert Shaw's 
' Municipal Government in Great 
Britain.' . . . The whole field of 
municipal monopolies has been cov- 
ered, and every paper has been writ- 
ten in a spirit of judicial fairness 
toward private corporations, as well 
as of warm devotion to the public 
interests. . . . To writers and 
thinkers on municipal problems the 
volume is almost indispensable." 
— Outlook, New York. 
Price, $2.00. 



Socialism 

Its Strength and Its Weakness, 
by 

RICHARD T. ELY, Ph.D., LL.D. 

'< Here for the first time the 
public is presented 'with a full 
and accurate account of Socialism 
as it is — its nature, its philosophy, 
its history, and its literature, with 
a lucid analysis of its strength and 
its weaknesses — from the stand- 
point of one who is neither advo-

tical suggestions would save millions 
of dollars now wasted in this coun- 
try by reason of preventable crime,

The Man Who Knew Better 

By T. GALLON 

Author of "Tatterley," etc. Illustrated by Gordon Browne. 

8vo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Gallon's sympathetic quality, his genuine sentiment and fine humor, established

This fresh novel, with its singularly attractive features, is certain to strengthen his hold 
upon readers. He has written a story which shows the meaning of the Christmas spirit in 
its broadest sense. His novel is a striking romance of hard-hearted worldliness redeemed 
by bitter experience, and the lessons of love and sympathy which it teaches will thrill and 
touch every reader.

for every one who cares for tales of the sailor's life, and for 
every one who holds to the brotherhood of man.

excellent story to give a vivid delineation of character.

tives that have distinguished this talented author's work.

An Unequalled Edition of the 

Life of Samuel Johnson 

By JAMES BOSWELL 

Printed by J. M. Dent ^ Co. of London for McClure^ Phillips ^ Co. Edited by Jrnold Glover^ 

with an introduction by Austin Dobson. 

QAMUEL JOHNSON was one of the most interesting personalities in the history of 
^ English letters, made so to us by Boswell's splendid biography. This work is often 
considered of greater excellence than Johnson's own writings. At all events, it is the standard 
of biographical literature, and deserving of the best in the art of book-making. This it has 
received in this new edition. It is handsomely printed and bound in three large octavo volumes, 
and richly illustrated. One hundred drawings by Herbert Railton, based on old topographic 
engravings and on such localities as still exist, form a lasting record of the places connected 
with Johnson and his times. In addition, the volumes contain ten photogravure portraits, done 
in colors, of Johnson and his contemporaries. Per set., j vols.., $g.oo net ; postpaid., $g.^6. 

A large-paper edition has also been prepared, limited to 350 copies for America, with a 
series of 30 portraits, reproduced in tinted photogravure, of Boswell, Johnson, and other con- 
temporaries. Per set., ^18.00 net ; postpaid., ^18.66. 



Life on the Stage 

By CLARA MORRIS 

Personal Experiences and 
Recollections. 

A LTHOUGH this is a book of the stage,

lights. It is but a collection of simple narra- 
tives, told with a peculiar tenderness and 
frankness, a gayety and a buoyancy, showing 
the "man and woman" side of the great per- 
sonages of the stage. In these true stories, 
the Booths, Lawrence Barrett, Jim Fiske, 
Augustin Daly, and many another figure out 
of the past in whom the world is interested, 
live again.

Much has been written with more or less 
accuracy concerning Pasteur's discoveries, but 
these volumes tell his life story. The work 
will never be equalled as a revelation of the 
man and of the methods by which he effected 
his tremendous achievements. It is author- 
ized by the Pasteur family, and written by 
Pasteur's own son-in-law.

"The startling realities of the 'Oolliwogg' and the grotesque 
attitudes of his feminine retainers, to say nothing of the entertaining 
doggerel upon which the pictures are threaded, will exert an almost 
inexhaustible influence for the entertainment of four years old and 
five. For absolute individuality and tenacity of charms there is no 
one to compare to the great black ' Oolliwogg ' and his Dutch-doll 
friends." — Literary World (Boston).

Nature as seen from a country house. 

NEIGHBOURS OF FIELD, WOOD AND 
STREAM 

By MORTON QRINNELL 

A book of country life that possesses a real interest for country- 
dwellers or visitors. Its characters, however, are not men or women. 
Instead, it deals with the lives and habits of the wild creatures of 
the fields, swamps and forests, thus treating of nature as it exists all 
about us. 

The natural history it accurate, and itt facts are given to entertain- 
ingly that the reader follows the story, quite unconscious that he is be- 
ing instructed. For the book's purposes, the birds, beasts and fishes 
are endowed with human intelligence and speech so that their actions 
and the motives that govern them are made vivid to the reader, and the 
characters become actual personalities. 

The illustrations are from life or the author's specimens placed 
with their natural surroundings, and so become object lessons to the 
young naturalists.

One of the motl beautiful editUnu of Shakespeare ever published. 

THE EDINBURGH SHAKESPEARE 

Edited by W. E. HENLEY 

In these days of notable and comely books, the Folio has somehow 
been left apart; this although it has ever been the pride and the deligkk 
of the true book-lorer. In the belief that here is a mistake, the 
Edinburgh Folio edition of Shakespeare will, it is hoped, prove a type 
and exemplar of modem bookmaking. 

Much nf the best printing of our time eonet from Edvtburgh; and 
the fact that thit Shaketpear". wiU be the especial effort of the Me$tr*. 
Contlable, vchote example hat been (U it not too much to taif) anin^tr- 
atUm, it enough to thotc that it* purpose and tffrct xcill be largeif tgfO 
grophieal and monumental. 

The Edinburgh Folio will be illostrated by ten aathentic portraits — 
several of Shakespeare himself, and others of Jonson, Fletcher, Barb- 
age, Southampton and Pembroke. 

The edition will consist of 1,000 copies, of which only 360 are for 
•ale in America. Each set will be numbered. 

The coat of each part will be $2.00 net, but the worit will be Mdd 
only in complete sets. 

The first part was published in October, 1901. The others will be 
issued in due sequence, two parts in each month.

THE RIGHT READING FOR VERY 
YOUNG CHILDREN. 



In considering the old-world and classic 
Nursery Books for children, and in discussing 
their suitability and value, one is confronted 
with two difficult problems, about which there 
has been of late much difference of opinion 
expressed. One problem is as to the literary 
style, and the other as to the content of the 
stories. 

There are those who desire to reduce all the 
classic stories to one uniform level of langaage, 
suited to what they consider to be the child's 
stage of mental development. On the other 
hand, there are those who believe that it is de- 
sirable to give the stories as nearly as possible 
in the form in which they were originally 
written. 

There are those also who object to anything 
like what may be called, for the want of a more 
definite expression, the " blood and thunder " 
element in some of the older nursery tales, and 
would eliminate altogether from the children's 
reading such stories as "Jack the Giant- 
Killer," "Jack and the Bean Stalk," etc.; 
while there are others who do not deem such 
stories to be harmful. 

Now, the selection of books for children 
should not be governed by any fads or passing 
fancies, but should be based upon principles 
that lie deep down and are permanent ; and as 
a great responsibility attaches to all who have 
anything to do with the upbringing of youth 
in connection with the choice of their books, it 
is very desirable to find out the right path and 
to pursue it. It should be premised that the

class of books to which I am referring are books 
intended to be pleasure-books for children, not 
lesson-books out of which they are to be 
taught, but books which they may read for their 
delight and gratification, and out of which they 
may get some mental nourishment to aid their 
growing intelligence and power of imagination, 
and help in the development of character. 

First, as to this question of style. Will not 
the child in reading for his pleasure, to get at 
the sense of a story, unconsciously absorb a 
more varied vocabulary, and therefore acquire a 
greater power of self-expression, if we give him 
books which have various and distinct charac- 
teristics of style? In the old-world wonder 
stories, as they may be called, the flavor of the 
style is that associated with books that belong 
to an earlier period of our history, a style 
adapted to the thought and action of the story ; 
and is it wise to attempt to reduce them to the 
common level of " schoolbookese," carefully 
adapted to every grade of school work, in order 
to make the task of the teacher smooth and his 
path straight? 

These stories, with their archaic flavor, 
written in a style remote from the present, are 
not as a rule unintelligible to the child in his 
pleasure reading at home or in school. Should 
not the child, from the beginning of his read- 
ing, be accustomed to varied styles in liter- 
ature, for the very same reason that his food 
should be varied ? Do we not want the child 
to absorb, not to discriminate, by means of his 
pleasure reading? Many of the archaisms 
which are objected to in these stories have a 
current value as much as those in the Bible 
and in Shakespeare. They are employed in 
later life, on rare occasions it is true, and gen- 
erally when the emotions are most deeply 
stirred ; they have the ring of true metal in 
them. I would not give children stilted or 
awkward sentences, or bad grammar, or coarse 
and vulgar language ; but I think there is 
much to say in favor of retaining the flavor of 
these earlier versions as much as possible. 

With reference to this question of variety 
of style, I have found in some very young 
children, long before one would have expected 
it, very considerable variations in the degree 
of their sensitiveness and appreciation. One 
child will enjoy the lilt of the ballad, while 
another child will become impatient with it. 
A very interesting story was recently told me, 
by an intelligent and highly cultivated lady, of 
her experience with her own little boy. One 
day, before he could speak, he was very un- 



quiet and fretful. She took him in her arms 
to quiet him, and purely by accident took up a 
book of English ballads and began to read 
aloud. She continued for some time, until the 
child, soothed, fell asleep. The next day at 
about the same hour the boy went to his 
mother and said, " Mamma, Mamma, la-la, 
la-la." She could not understand what he 
meant ; but he continued persistently. She put 
her hand upon everything within reach, and 
finally upon the green book from which she 
had read the ballads the day before. With 
intense excitement the child cried, " Mamma, 
la-la ; Mamma, la-la," and she repeated the 
reading of the day before. Day after day for 
months that child insisted upon having his dose 
of ballad ; and now that he is a grown-up young 
man, he still keeps his love for that particular 
form of literature. 

A careful observation of children will indi- 
cate, too, that character is early indicated by 
the tastes they evince in these directions. The 
first bit of rhyme learned by a little boy whom 
I once knew well was the action- verse of Mother 
Goose, — 

"There was a man of Thessaly, 

And he was wondrous wise, 
He jumped into a bramble bush, 

And scratched out both his eyes." 

The next thing that attracted him as he grew 
older, and which he appropriated of his own 
accord, was 

" Drive the nail aright, boys, 
Hit it on the head." 

Vigorous rhymes of this kind always appealed 
to him ; and when he grew up he became a 
sturdy, indomitable, forceful man of action. 

Now, with regard to the content of such 
stories as those of the " Jack " series, it is 
necessary to repeat that they are not put before 
children with a view to teaching them the tales; 
but is there any reason why healthy children 
of to-day should not read these stories with as 
much delight and as little possibility of harm 
as the children of past generations have done, 
whereof the memory of man runneth not to the 
contrary ? 

If a boy is left to grow up without making 
acquaintance with such stories in his early 
days, is he not far more likely to get hold of 
the " blood and thunder " literature which he 
will find on the news-stands, at an age when it 
is more likely to be hurtful to him, than if the 
natural desire for reading about deeds such as 
those described in the tales to which I am refer- 
ring had been satisfied at an earlier period ?

President G. Stanley Hall tells us that the 
love of fight is " biological and self-preserva- 
tive "; behind all that we call moral courage 
there must be something of the physical to back 
it up. In fact, what we call moral courage is the 
outgrowth of something physical ; and do not 
the pictures of physical courage and prowess 
in these stories, without always exactly impel- 
ling the child to go and do likewise, inspire 
him with a sense of conflict and conquest, which, 
when once stirred, can be led in directions 
where it tends to the making of strong char- 
acter ? 

A great deal has been said on the subject of 
the heritage of fear with which every child may 
be said to be born. I know of a boy who was 
never painfully disturbed by any of the " Jack- 
the-Giant-Killer " stories, but who was rendered 
miserable and unhappy for many years of his 
little life by the nameless horrors with which 
the teaching of the doctrines of Calvinistic 
Christianity filled his little soul. It is quite 
right to shield the young from needless and 
nameless terrors, but the most fearful child 
thrills with delight and glows with satisfaction 
when he finds that the giants and other beings 
that inspired him with terror are defeated; 
and are not these perfectly legitimate sensations 
to evoke ? 

We older folk are stirred to the depths of 
our being by a dramatic representation, but all 
the while at the back of our minds we know 
that the actual tragedy is not actually taking 
place before our eyes ; and has not the boy, 
long before he reaches the age of scepticism 
about his fairy stories, a similar kind of sub- 
consciousness which does not interfere with the 
emotions evoked ? Charles Welsh. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE BOOKS CHILDREN PREFER. 
(To the Editor of Thk Dial.) 

Wishing to know what books children prefer (rather 
than what books parents prefer for their children), I 
recently took the vote of about two thousand young 
people, between the ages of nine and fifteen, belonging 
to the " Advance Society," an association which I organ- 
ized several years ago for the encouragement of good 
reading among the young, and which has a weekly 
department in the St. Louis "Christian-Evangelist." 
These children live in thirty-nine states, and Canada, 
and I feel justified in the conclusion that the lists for- 
warded are fairly representative of the tastes of Ameri- 
can childhood. 

I have often suspected that joTenile works are writ- 



ten upon the supposition that youthful minds cannot 
digest strong intellectual food. When I was young, 
I looked with disfavor upon all works ostentatiously 
" for boys and girls." But was I an exception ? It 
was this point I determined to settle. Why are juve- 
nile works usually for the day, only ? If they reach 
the heart of the young, should they not possess the 
perennial freshness possessed by great novels — since 
the young we have always with us ? But if the young 
prefer books which older readers enjoy, why should we 
seek to disguise the truth ? That such works cannot 
be appreciated in all their depths, is apparent enough ; 
but do young people find so much which they can 
appreciate in mature works, that they prefer them to 
books carefully written down to the comprehension of 
boys and girls ? When the cautious mother presents 
her daughter with a copy of "Little Flossy's Rainy 
Day," or " How Lena Did," is that daughter secretly 
wondering if David Copperfield will find his aunt's 
house, or if Jean Yaljean will reach a happy, serene 
old age ? 

In taking the vote, each child was requested to send 
a list of his or her ten favorite books, in the order of 
preference, and a list of the three authors found per- 
sonally most enjoyable. I was assured by mature 
readers that few lists would be sent, since children of 
from nine to fifteen years of age have not read ten 
books for pleasure; but, still mindful of my own youth- 
ful experiences, I put from me the thought that I 
might have been a g^at exception to the human race, 
and waited. I heard from nearly all of the two thou- 
sand members, and the thiity-five books which fol- 
low are those oftenest named in the lists forwarded. 
The little girl who, in her list of ten, named the 
books which received the greatest popular vote, was 
ten years old. I name the works in the order of their 
popularity : 

Little Women, Uncle Tom's Cabin, Robinson Crusoe, 
Old Fashioned Girl, Black Beauty, Little Men, Under 
the Lilacs, Longfellow's Poems, Dickens's Child's His- 
tory of England, John Halifax, Pilgrim's Progress, 
Joe's Boys, Little Lord Fauntleroy, David Copperfield, 
Eight Cousins, Rose in Bloom, Barriers Burned Away, 
Last Days of Pompeii, Ten Nights in a Bar-Room, 
Swiss Family Robinson, The Lamplighter, Helen's 
Babies, Wide Wide World, Lady of the Lake, Ivan- 
hoe, Jane Eyre, .33sop's Fables, Elsie Dinsmore, OUver 
Twist, Prince and the Pauper, Lamb's Tales from 
Shakespeare, Alice in Wonderland, Through the Look- 
ing-Glass, Green Mountain Boys, Titus. 

A great many other books were general favorites, 
coming close behind the leading thirty-five. A few of 
these, standing high in the list of favorites, were the 
following: Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, Prince of 
the House of David, Deerslayer, Thaddens of Warsaw, 
Scottish Chiefs, Old Curiosity Shop, Adam Bede, Mad- 
cap Violet, Scarlet Letter, Vicar of Wakefield, Frank- 
lin's Autobiography. 

The following authors proved the most popular: 
Miss Alcott, Longfellow, Dickens, Whittier, Scott, E. P. 
Roe, Sophie May, Mrs. Stowe, Mrs. Burnett, Bryant, 
J. T. Trowbridge, Martha Finley, James Whitcomb 
Riley, Eugene Field, Mary E. Wilkins, Kate Douglas 
Wiggin, Irving, Thomas Moore. 

These facts carry their moral with them. Are they 
not of more value than a world of theories ?

John Richard Grebn.* 



The author of "A Short History of the 
English People " was born in 1837, and died 
in 1883, at the comparatively early age of 
forty-five. Although eighteen years have 
elapsed since his death, his life has not hith- 
erto been written. Mr. Leslie Stephen has at 
last undertaken the task, at the request of Mrs. 
Green, and the result is a biography, chiefly 
compounded of Green's letters, and thus essen- 
tially autobiographical in character, which is 
one of the most important books of the year, 
and one of the most fascinating books of its 
kind in English literature. Just why there 
has been so much delay in the publication of 
this material, which is treasure-trove in the 
highest sense, is not explained. Mr. Stephen 
simply asks his readers " to take for granted 
that there have been sufiicient reasons " for 
the postponement. The work consists mainly 
of the letters, as has already been stated, and 
the editor's own contributions to the text con- 
sist of introductory narratives to the four 
chapters into which the book divides, and a 
few connective and explanatory passages. For 
this matter, Mrs. Green supplied most of the 
facts, although the editor has also drawn upon 
articles by Mr. Bryce, H. K. Haweis, E. A. 
Freeman, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and one or 
two others. Most of the early letters are ad- 
dressed to Professor Boyd Dawkins, the famous 
geologist, who was a life-long friend of the 
historian, while the later letters are mostly 
addressed to Freeman, who always had a warm 
place in his affections for the "Johnnie 
Green " whose early efforts he had encouraged. 
An appendix to the work contains a bibliog- 
raphy of Green's writings, and the text of the 
sermon which he preached in memory of his 
dear friend, Mrs. Henry Ward, mother of Mr. 
Humphry Ward, who died in 1862. 

Green was born at Oxford, and entered 
Magdalen Grammar School at the age of eight. 
Here is a reminiscence from those earliest days 
of his self-consciousness. 

" All was not fun or poetry in those early school 
days. The old brutal flogging was still in favour, and 
the old stupid system of forcing boys to learn by rote. 
I was set to learn Latin grammar from a grammar in 
Latin! and a flogging every week did very little to help 
me. I was simply stupefied, — for my father had never

Stephen. With portraits. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



struck me, and at first the cane hurt me like a blow, — 
but the ' stupid stage ' soon came, and I used to fling 
away my grammar into old churchyards, and go up for 
my ' spinning ' as doggedly as the rest. Everything 
had to be learned by memory, and by memory, then, as 
now, I could learn nothing. How I picked up Latiu 
Heaven knows; but somehow I did pick it up, and when 
we got to books where head went for something I be- 
gan to rise fast among my fellow schoolboys. But I 
really hated my work, and my mind gained what it 
gained not from my grammars and construing, but 
from an old school library which opened to me treas- 
ures I had never dreamed of." 

This distaste for the routine methods of edu- 
cation debarred him from high university 
distinctions, but was in reality, as the event 
proved, his scholarly and artistic salvation. 
His genius was too original to suffer compres- 
sion into the academic mould, which would 
have deadened his most vital intellectual im- 
pulses. Religion was an early preoccupation 
with him, and for a time his youthful bent 
seemed to be in the direction of Catholicism. 
But this inclination never went any farther 
than the announcement, at the age of fifteen, 
that he intended to join " the Church of Rome 
as soon as his brother Anglicans should be ready 
to accompany him." Since this amounted to 
putting the matter off until the Greek Kal- 
ends, there does not seem to have been any 
real danger. 

Green was matriculated at Jesus College in 
1855, and it was there that he contracted the 
friendship with Dawkins for which the readers 
of these letters have such cause to be thankful. 
The chief intellectual influence of those col- 
lege years was Stanley, who helped him when 
he most needed spiritual succor, and probably 
determined his choice of the clerical vocation 
by making him realize that the church stood 
for something more than Oxford theology. 
When it came to his examination for orders, 
he " flatly refused to read Paley's ' Evidences ' 
even at the cost of rejection, because, he said, 
the argument was out of date." Stanley ap- 
preciated the difficulty, and told him to take 
up the " Horse Paulinae " instead. When the 
examination came, the bishop, who was strong 
on Paley, made difficulties, and summoned 
the young man to an interview. Green told 
the story, and the bishop said, " O Stanley, 
Stanley !" During his college years, he wrote 
busily on his favorite subjects, but also min- 
gled with people, and gave evidence of his 
remarkable social talent. He even indulged 
in an occasional flirtation and began to think 
of marriage. This is his ideal in the year of 
his majority :

" I have not settled on the individoal, but I can tell 
you the species. Xot the beautiful — your Junos, Min- 
ervas, or Venus's, — but some quiet, demure, little party 
whose beauty at the best will be that of expression ; 
who won't mind pets, humors, and eccentricities ; who 
will never invade my study or pop in on my musings 
with some vapid suggestion to visit the Blinks's or 
some bothering inquiry about papering and painting. 
Some one who won't talk of her love, or expect demon- 
strations in return, but whose love will be like sunshine, 
changing and warming and comforting, and lighting 
up all the dark corners of one's morbid temperament. 
Some one who can decipher my horrible scrawl and copy 
my manuscripts for the printer. Some one who can pet 
our little ones without spoiling them ; who will care for 
me without overcaring for me ; who will be charitable 
without any anxiety for niggers at Timbuctoo ; and 
good without confession twice a week or working slip- 
pers for some « dear ' curate. Some one who can play 
without being constantly strumming ; who can paint 
without having her fingers always smudgy ; who can 
contrive a good dinner and yet not degenerate into a 
mere housekeeper." 

Green's friendship with Dawkins gave him 
a lively interest in science, and this contributed 
not a little to the value of his historical work. 
He always wrote history with an eye to the 
physical characters of the scenes wherein it 
was enacted, and readers of his most popular 
book will know the charm of his descriptions. 
One of the finest qualities of his writing results 
directly from the fact that he consulted nature 
as well as books and brasses, manuscripts and 
monuments. But humanity always had the 
first place in his interests. Writing once to 
Dawkins, he said : " Interesting as ' the anti- 
clinal axis of Old Red,' ' the flexures and dips ' 
of the Mendip range may be, Man and Man's 
History to my mind is worth them all. XihU 
geologicum a me alienum puto, but still Tri- 
lobites and Echini are only Kingcrabs and 
Starfishes, while Man is Man." Speaking of 
his scientific interests, we may note that the 
epoch-making book of Darwin found him ready 
to understand it without making the usual 
theological di£Bculties. He was one of those 
who witnessed, with glee at the discomfiture 
of the theologian, the famous passage-at-arms 
between Wilberforce and Huxley in the Sum- 
mer of 1860. The story has had several 
versions, and Green's is one of the liveliest of 
them all. 

" I was introduced to Robert Chambers (the supposed 
author of the ' Vestiges ') the other day, and heard him 
chuckle over the episcopal defeat. I have n't told you 
that story, have I ? On Saturday morning I met Jen- 
kins going to the Museum. We joined company, and 
he proposed going to section D, the Zoology, etc., « to 
hear the Bishop of Oxford smash Darwin.' « Smash 
Darwin ! Smash the Pyramids ! ' said I, in great wrath, 
and muttering something about ' impertinence,' which 



caused Jenkins to explain that the Bishop was < a first- 
elass in mathematics, yon know, and so has a right to 
treat on scientific matters,' which of course silenced my 
eavils. Well, when Professor Draper had ceased his 
hour and a half of nasal Yankeeism, up rose ' Sam- 
mivel,' and proceeded to act the smasher ; the white 
chokers, who were abundant, cheered lustily, a sort of 
* Pitch it into him' cheer, and the smasher got so up- 
roarious as to pitch into Darwin's friends — Darwin 
being smashed — and especially Professor Huxley. 
Still the white chokers cheered, and the smasher rattled 
on. < He had been told that Professor Huxley had said 
that he did'nt see that it mattered much to a man 
whether his grandfather was an ape or not. Let the 
learned Professor speak for himself ' and the like. 
Which being ended — and let me say that such rot 
never fell from episcopal lips before — arose Huxley, 
young, cool, quiet, sarcastic, scientific in fact and in 
treatment, and gave his lordship such a smashing as he 
may meditate on with profit over his port at Cuddeston." 

The rest of the story, as contained in the words 
of Huxley's reply, has frequently been printed, 
and is familiar to the public. 

Green's clerical career began at the close of 
1860, and lasted for over eight years. He oc- 
cupied five posts, and his work was mostly done 
in the East End. " He made friends with the 
poor individually as he did with more culti- 
vated persons. He sympathized with their 
troubles and planned amusements for them, 
getting up penny readings or taking them 
to Rosherville or Epping Forest." Green's 
activity during his clerical period would be 
astonishing in a strong man ; it is doubly 
astonishing in a man of his delicate consti- 
tution. He was early threatened with danger- 
ous disease, and the last fifteen years of his 
life were one protracted struggle against the 
ravages of the malady that finally proved fatal. 
But he worked manfully away at his parish 
duties besides doing an incredible amount of 
Saturday Reviewing and other miscellaneous 
writing, and at the same time gathering material 
and strength for his own most serious work. 
A great grief came to him early in his clerical 
life in the death of Mrs. Henry Ward, the 
wife of his incumbent, and the sermon here re- 
printed as an Appendix gives expression to his 
appreciation of her character. The letters to 
Freeman begin in 1864, and become increas- 
ingly frequent and meaty. The following, 
written with reference to the second volume 
of the "Xorman Conquest," is a typical speci- 
men : 

"My dear Freeman — this is simply to tell you I 
have done it — appendices and all — and vote for the 
greatest living historian we have. Not that that will 
astonish you — or that if I say it as I shall in print you 
will do anything but write an immensely long letter 
blowing me up ! But never mind, that < Seolac ' is

When edition 2 comes, run your pen through two- 
thirds of the ' Now's ' and three-quarters of the ' Then's.'

swell to believe it.' 

" But never mind — you are the Gt. Hn. now living, 
and you have a right to be as mad as a hatter, and to 
believe what you please. Q. E. D. — Good-bye." 

A sharp attack of pleurisy in 1867 gave 
Green warning that he must change his mode 
of life if he would not speedily terminate his 
career. After much hesitation, he decided to 
give up the Church, and devote himself to his- 
torical writing in more favorable surroundings 
than he had hitherto enjoyed. How he felt 
about this change of life is indicated in the 
letter from which we take this passage : 

" I have a great wish not to part cable altogether — 
the hold the church has over me, however slight, is a 
really healthy hold to a mind like mine. Moreover, I 
have still a great faith in the capacity of the Ecclesia 
Anglicana to meet the national requirements of En- 
gland in a way that no sectional action can do. And 
then, too, there is the feeling of honor which tells 
against quitting a ship when she looks as if she were 
getting into rough water." 

A sort of commentary on these words may 
be taken from an earlier letter describing an 
excursion of Green's parishioners to Eosher- 
ville. 

" One never realizes what the monotony and narrow- 
ness of the life and thoughts of the ordinary shop- 
keeper is, till one spends a whole day in the midst of 
them, as one does on the excursion day once a year; 
twice a year it would kill me. Luckily I have immense 
social powers with these people, and they all voted me 
most chatty and agreeable; but the blank burthen of 
the day was indescribable. I retreated from it coming 
home into a corner and found a charming little maiden 
of 17 who prattled to me of everything in heaven and 
earth, with a great many 'Mr. Green's' in every sentence. 
I told her I usually carried a book in my pocket in 
case I had nothing to do for half an hour. « Oh, yes,' 
she said, « I suppose it is the Bible.' Ah, me ! it was 
the Physiologie du godt. But are these the thoughts 
of little maidens concerning parsons — are we ideals 
with perennial Bibles in our pockets ? " 

When Green found himself at last freed 
from clerical duties, the sense of relief was very 
great, and even the knowledge that his physical 
condition was precarious could not curb his ex- 
uberance of spirit. " Won't it be jolly to have 
no sermons to preach on Sundays !" he writes to 
Freeman ; and a few days later, " Oh, Freeman, 



my good fellow, how I wish you were here. I 
am in such tearing spirits at the prospect of 
Freedom. William Tell, ora pro nobis. Oh, 
Leonidas, Garibaldi, all illustrious Bards of 
freedom, hoorah-te pro nobis !" The next five 
years of his life belong to the " Short His- 
tory " — " Little Book," he calls it in his let- 
ters. The Macmillans had offered him terms 
which relieved him of the problem of liveli- 
hood, — at least in its more pressing aspects — 
and he was not called upon to struggle against 
poverty and disease at the same time. His 
long projected work on the Angevin kings was 
set aside, for he realized that the chances were 
against his living to complete it. But the 
" Short History " represented a task that lay 
well within his powers and the span of life that 
probably remained to him, and he set about the 
work with zest. The plan is first mentioned in 
a letter dated near the close of 1869, and from 
that time on the correspondence is largely 
concerned with the progress of the work. 

The remainder of Green's life was spent 
largely abroad. He had visited Normandy in 
1867, and Anjou the following year, but it 
was not until the autumn of 1869 that he had 
his first glimpse of Italy. He wrote of this 
trip: 

'« I came back last week very tired, but with a new 
sense of the world's beauty, and — what will you say 
to me — a resolve to go to Italy every year till I die. 
The land has cast its spell on me as it did on Theodoric 
and the Ottos." 

It was just after his return from this visit that 
a consultation with his physician revealed the 
fact that his life was hanging by a thread. 
Instead of discouraging him, this knowledge 
seemed to supply a new inspiration for work ; 
and, for a man in his condition, his activities 
during the remaining years of his life seem 
almost incredible. A letter of 1871 has this 
acute bit of philosophy: 

" The Piazza at Florence gave me the same thrill that 
I remember on the Lake of Lucerne : — I am afraid an 
even more delightful thrill, for after all Swiss dem- 
ocracy is a democracy of institutions, we admire its 
constitution, its landesgemeinde and the like, but Flor- 
entine democracy was a democracy of men. Teu- 
tonic freedom is too often a development of man on 
one side only, the political, while Italian was (I feel 
all the answer that lies in that ♦ was ') a development 
of the whole man — political, intellectual, religious, 
artistic." 

The next extract is written from San Remo : 

" I am going to high mass to-morrow, inasmuch as 
Catholicism has an organ and Protestantism only a 
harmonium, and the difference of truth between them 
don't seem to me to make up for the difference of in- 
struments."

This seems to indicate that it was just as 
well Green should have given up his duties as 
a priest of the Anglican communion. His sense 
of humor remains as keen as ever. Meeting 
Professor Mahaffy in Rome, he writes thus of 
the encounter: 

" He was on his way to Athens, and simply picking 
up stray bits of Hellenism, sculptures and what not, by 
the road. One of his aims is to verify Greek busts ; 
he doubts « Pericles,' and a little doubts Alexander — 
whereat I wept and fled. Likewise he is seeking to 
know how Hellenic youug women kept their clothes on, 
a question wrapped in the deepest mystery, and in- 
soluble by the Highest Germany. Perhaps it was too 
insoluble for the Hellenic young women themselves, 
as to judge from the later sculptures they seem soon 
to have dropt the effort to keep their clothes on. Per- 
haps that is why Mahaffy calls the Periclean time the 
age of Decadence." 

The " Short History " was published in 1874, 
and had a great and immediate success. It 
took the public by storm, much as Macaulay's 
history had done a quarter of a century before. 
It was no sooner off his hands than Green was 
busy with projects for extension and revision. 
The revision of the one-volume work proved 
beyond his powers, but the extension into the 
four-volume " History " became an accomp- 
lished fact in 1880. " The Making of Eng- 
land " followed in 1882, and " The Conquest 
of England " a year later, the year of the 
author's death. The " Stray Studies from 
England and Italy " were first collected in 1876, 
the " Readings from English History " were 
edited in 1879, and the " Short Geography of 
the British Islands " was published in the same 
year. This latter work was done with the help 
of his wife, for Green was married in 1877 to 
Miss Alice Stopford, and his last six years 
were blessed with a wedded companionship of 
unusual sympathy and intimacy. A series of 
articles on " Oxford during the Last Century " 
and a selection of the " Essays of Joseph Ad- 
dison " completes the list of books bearing 
Green's name. The series of " Primers " which 
he edited should not go unmentioned, nor the 
many articles written for the " Saturday Re- 
view," of which over one hundred and sixty 
are here listed. And all this work was done 
by a man who never knew what robust health 
meant, and the last fifteen years of whose life 
were one protracted struggle with the arch 
enemy. His life was heroic in a higher than 
the usual sense, and the revealing record now 
published endears him to our memory even 
more than do his books.

Clipping the "Wings of Romance.* 



Many a reader today, as he looks back over 
the current flood of historical fiction, will re- 
member the time when it first became apparent 
that Realism was not the only force in litera- 
ture. With some " The Ballad of East and 
West" marks the moment, with some "The 
Prisoner of Zenda," with some " Under the 
Red Robe." With some it was "Doctor Pascal'* 
or " Lourdes." There were many even, watch- 
ers in the dawn, who felt the truth within 
them when they confessed a wild delight at 
" King Solomon's Mines," when they speculated 
deeply upon " Mr. Isaacs," when they sat up 
all night over "The Wreck of the Grovener." 
Whatever the moment, the time came when 
Realism was not the one thing needful, when 
Naturalism seemed unnatural, when Psycho- 
logy was captured by the laboratory, and 
Human Documents were no longer seen in 
the magazines. Then began for many a very 
happy time : they could read a novel, enjoy 
it immensely, and yet feel that they were 
literary. Then Stevenson became the idol of 
the hour. 

We have lived on since those days with minor 
literary movements, but still we remain in the 
temper to think well of Romance, to like to 
read about it, in fact to welcome such a book 
as Professor Beers's " History of English Ro- 
manticism." We feel in touch with Romance 
to-day. 

This new volume of Mr. Beers's work is more 
interesting in its subject than was the first, on 
the eighteenth century, as anyone will under* 
stand. But not the subject only is interesting. 
The book is easily written, has much curious 
detail, much just criticism. It informs us on 
many points, recalls to mind a good deal with 
which we were sub-consciously familiar, differs 
with us on a good many points where we can 
argue pleasantly. It is not too scholarly for 
general reading, nor so popular as to be useless 
for the student. 

I do not myself agree with the author as to 
his conception of Romanticism. This may be 
ancient history now, for that conception was 
put forward in the previous volume and debated 
by his critics a year ago. But the matter is 
even more important in this volume, and as it 
is hardly possible to give an idea of the book 
without saying something about its subject, I

make no apology for discussing the matter 
again. 

Prof. Beers defines romanticism as medieval- 
ism in modern letters and art. He explained 
and defended this view in his first volume, and 
now he remarks upon some criticisms, that 
*' every writer has a right to make his own 
definitions ; or at least to say what his book 
shall be about." His own book he wishes to 
be about the revival of medievalism in nine- 
teenth century literature. Hence he writes of 
Scott's poems and of some of his novels, of 
Coleridge's poetry and of Keats and Leigh 
Hunt, of the romanticists of Germany and 
France, of Tennyson, of the Pre-Raphaelites 
and the neo-Pre-Raphaelites ; and, finally, of 
the medievalising tendencies outside of litera- 
ture, such as the Anglo-Catholic movement, 
the revival of interest in Gothic architecture 
and the socialistic interpretation of the Middle 
Ages. That is surely an interesting set of 
topics ; if a man likes to read of those matters 
and write of them, why not read his work with 
pleasure ? 

I have read his book with pleasure ; indeed 
I rather think that that is the reason why I 
cannot be wholly satisfied with it. Call it ro- 
manticism or not, I feel that there should be 
something more. If only Professor Beers 
would say, " All in good time, my little sir." 
Perhaps he is about to write other volumes still. 
Quarreling about the definition of terms is 
stupid business for third parties, but after all 
is it not tantalizing for a man to give you a 
book about the romance of " Ivanhoe " and 
*' Quentin Durward " and yet say nothing about 
"The Bride of Lammermoor " and "Waver- 
ley," to tell of the romance of Tennyson and 
yet be silent concerning the Brontes, to tell us 
about " Lautrec " by Payne and " Lays of 
France " by O'Shaughnessey and to omit en- 
tirely all mention of Stevenson ? 

Ivanhoe is a romanticfigure and so is Quentin 
Durward. But is not Lucy Ashton ? Her 
brother thought so. And is not Edward Wa- 
verley ? He himself at least, felt that he had 
known romance. Professor Beers chose to 
write of the medieval part, but how can one 
write well of one without saying a word of the 
other ? Lucy Ashton and the Master of Ra- 
venswood are typical romantic figures, — 
typical certainly of the romance of their time, 
which no doubt had its weak and its silly side. 
But aside from all that, it had something posi- 
tive, and its positive power was not different 
from that of Rebecca and Wilfred when the 



stage tinsel of medievalism had been taken 
away. Scott went directly from one to the 
other ; how can we say, it was romance in the 
summer of 1819 but not in the spring? 
Surely there must have been something in com- 
mon, and that something very probably the 
thing worth knowing about. Medievalism was 
largely stage setting, — even Professor Beers 
sees nothing very meritorious in it, — just as 
the sighing and sternness was largely sentiment ; 
but how can one look beneath and not see that 
the real thing is that which they have in com- 
mon ? 

Scott set a fashion of medievalism, and there 
were other fashions too in the years following 
the Waverleys. Professor Beers is not writing 
of Realism and he has nothing to say of 
Dickens. But Dickens himself (who can doubt 
it?) had his fancy for romance. Without 
counting Sidney Carton on the scaffold, think 
of Lady Dedlock lying before the grated ruin 
where her lover was buried, of Lizzie Hexam 
rowing her father about as he plied his strange 
vocation on the river, of Miss Haversham in 
her rotting wedding dress and her one satin 
slipper, and of how many more. Dickens often 
thought of himself as dealing with romance, 
as he says in the preface to " Bleak House," 
the romance of real life. Better examples still 
of the same sort of thing are " Jane Eyre " and 
" Wuthering Heights." Not medievalism of 
course, but that spirit of romance was not so 
different from the spirit which underlay the 
medievalism, that we can appreciate the one 
without the other. 

And then Stevenson. Surely Professor Beers 
might have let him in. He was of the nine- 
teenth century and he wrote " The Black Ar- 
row." It is true that he cared very little for 
" The Black Arrow " (called it tushery, never, 
oh never, read it, once published) ; but after 
all is the spirit of the book so different from 
that of '• Kidnapped " and " Treasure Island" ? 
Professor Beers does not write of Stevenson : 
he prefers to write of the medieval revival, and 
he holds that he has the right to use the defini- 
tion of romanticism that he finds in the dic- 
tionary. Quite so : a man should certainly 
have preferences and he certainly cannot be 
blamed for using a dictionary. Still, a historian 
of literature will want to be something more 
than a chartered libertine and a colleague of 
the Earl of Chatham and Theophile Gautier. 
He will want to be one who in all the superficial 
appearances of literary history perceives the 
true tendencies, one who is not misled by fancies

and eccentricities but perceives true likenesses 
and affinities, one who can make clear and 
intelligible and interesting matters which had 
been confused and without sense. 

The fact that men of letters were interested 
in medievalism, though it may itself be ex- 
plained, does not do much to explain the course 
of literature in the nineteenth century. I 
should like an explanation of " Waverley," for 
instance, and especially of " St. Ronan's Well"; 
I should like Byron and Browning given a 
place in the general movement; I should like 
to know why Dickens loved the romance of 
real life; why the Pre-Raphaelites became 
aesthetics and then decadents ; in what ways, 
beside the individuality of genius, Stevenson 
differs from Scott. Doubtless Professor Beers 
has no desire to explain these matters. 

I avoid saying what I consider romance. 
Professor Beers describes others who offer 
definitions as seeking " to express the true in- 
wardness of romantic literature by analyzing 
it into its elements, selecting one of those 
elements as essential and rejecting all the rest 
as accidental." That process seems to me well 
enough, provided always that the one element 
selected turned out really to be essential. 
Such a result I should say was one of the tests 
as to whether the work were well done or not. 
Professor Beers certainly cannot imagine that 
the true critical method consists in analyzing 
something into elements and considering them 
all equally important. That at least is not his 
own method, for he goes through no analysis 
at all, but settles on one quality (an accidental 
one, by the way) and decides that his book 
shall be about that. 

All this discussion about the name of a 
book may seem hypercritical. It is not, for 
only when we understand just what his subject 
is, can we understand why Professor Beers 
does not say upon it anything really illuminat- 
ing or final. I should say he failed to explain 
the one element which he considers. In dealing 
with the romance of medievalism apart from the 
other forms of romanticism, he makes it im- 
possible to get the true understanding of either. 
That is why his book, though careful and 
abounding in curious and interesting points, 
does not have any of those real generalizations 
and keen bits of insight that are so exhilarat- 
ing to the reader, and when well-founded so 
valuable to the student. 

Professor Beers really knows better. He 
knows that romanticism is something more 
than medievalism, for he often uses the word in 



the broader sense. And if it means something 
more, that is only because a greater number 
of things to which the word may be applied 
have something in common, and if they have 
something in common, it is probable that they 
will be better understood by an exposition of 
it. This Professor Beers is well aware of For 
it is the principle which guided him in his 
first volume, which, although based on the 
same definition, really deals with many things 
which have not the slightest touch of medi- 
evalism. He saw that a true history demanded 
a treatment of various things which lay out- 
side his definition. I am sorry that he did not 
take the same liberty in the present volume.

A Queen's Comrade.* 

It seems odd, after a reading of "The 
Queen's Comrade," that no writer of biogra- 
phy before Mr. Molloy has thought of exploit- 
ing the life of Sarah, first Duchess of Marl- 
borough. Comrade of one queen and influential 
enemy to another and two kings besides, she 
played a part in English politics such as no 
woman before or since her day has aspired to. 
She was possessed of an almost Napoleonic 
effrontery and an outspoken brusqueness wor- 
thy of Cromwell himself. And yet, through 
the recent flood of memoirs, lives, and letters 
she has waited until now for her Boswell. 
Possibly this is because she has inspired her 
would-be biographers with the same awe which 
kept most of her contemporaries in unwilling 
subjection. It was certainly no easy task to 
reconstruct from the appalling mass of letters, 
journals, contemporary history, and state pa- 
pers, which confront the student of the Stuart 
period, first the strange, strong personality of 
the Duchess, and then as a background the 
stirring days in which she lived. Yet there 
was the material for a fascinating narrative, 
and Mr. Molloy has written it with a finish 
which betrays the practiced hand. 

The best thing about his book is that it has 
both vitality and accuracy. The author does 
not allow his wealth of material to oppress the 
reader whose interest is in results, not pro- 
cesses ; neither does he permit his imagination 
to indulge in any riotous games of theoretic 
chance. His history — for, as we shall see, the

book is practically an account of the English 
court during the Duchess's lifetime, with the 
stress laid on personalities rather than on 
principles — is detailed, anecdotal, vivid, but 
trustworthy because supported in every in- 
stance by documentary evidence. Gossippy of 
course so intimate a narrative is bound to be, 
but the gossip is authentic and no modern 
invention. 

Judged by a narrowly conventional standard 
Mr. Molloy is open to criticism for a tendency 
already noted to disregard the requirements of 
a strict sense of unity. For nearly a chapter 
every now and then we lose sight of the 
Duchess, while we read of club life in Queen 
Anne's London, of Monmouth's rebellion, or 
William's intrigues, presented with a detail 
that has little if any direct bearing on the 
Duchess's career. But her royal acquaintances 
are so well worth knowing that we are very 
willing to condone the lack of subordination 
resulting from undue attention to their high- 
nesses, merely for the sake of the broader out- 
look thus afforded. Also — and here is the 
real defense for the introduction of so much 
seemingly extraneous material — there is noth- 
ing in the book which does not help the reader 
to a grasp of the curious ethical standard of 
the times, without an understanding of which 
the Duchess would be incomprehensible, — a 
monster of insincerity, cupidity, and ingrati- 
tude. As it is, she moves before us very hu- 
man, completely in and of the world around 
her, now the centre of that world's shifting 
interest, then pushed into the background. So, 
like all but the greatest of mankind, — the few 
indisputable heroes who can hold the stage 
against all comers, — she played her varying 
part, now heroine, now supernumerary ; and 
thus Mr. Molloy has wisely chosen to repro- 
duce her. 

She was born on the gala May-day of 
Charles II. 's glad return from exile, and spent 
much of the impressionable period of her life 
at the Merry Monarch's brilliant and vicious 
court, as playmate to the shy little Princess 
Anne and maid of honor to the second Duchess 
of York, Anne's step-mother. It was while 
she was acting in this latter capacity that Col. 
John Churchill, Master of Robes to the Duke 
of York, met her at a ball and was caught 
fast in the toils of her wilful beauty. Utterly 
incapable apparently, even in girlhood, of any 
deep affection, Sarah was keenly appreciative 
of her lover's brilliant prospects ; and, after 
repeated avowals of love undying on his part 



and insolent rebuffs and accusations of insin- 
cerity on hers, she was finally pleased to be 
gracious ; and at the age of seventeen became 
Col. Churchill's wife. In spite of her self- 
ishness, her caprices, her frightful temper, and 
her dangerous outspokenness which ultimately 
wrecked his career at its height, her husband 
seems always to have loved her warmly and to 
have found his truest happiness in her society. 
She, on the other hand, appears to have re- 
garded him from the first as chiefly a tool of 
her ambitions, a convenient threat to hold over 
the head of the hapless Anne when, like the 
traditional worm, she ventured to turn upon 
her oppressor. 

It was not until the close of the tragic reign 
of James, whose hard fate it was always to 
act against himself, that Lady Churchill, 
whose influence over Anne had by this time 
become absolute, began to take an active part 
in politics, her first move being, characteris- 
tically enough, to incite Anne against the king 
who had been to her the kindest of fathers and 
to the Churchills the most generous of bene- 
factors. Highly typical of the heartless fri- 
volity of the time is the account Mr. Molloy 
gives us of Anne's light-hearted desertion of 
her father. Accompanied by Lady Churchill, 
who seems to have planned the affair as a con- 
venient means of escape for herself from the 
monarch her husband had betrayed, the doting 
Anne " stole down a backstairs " to the coach 
which was awaiting her. 

" The escapade had for her something of the excite- 
ment and pleasure of an elopement. The fact of her 
high-heeled shoe sticking in the mud caused much 
merriment, and Lord Dorset's pulling off his leather 
gauntletted glove and begging her to slip her foot into 
it as he half carried her to the coach, gave him the air 
of a second-hand Raleigh. She was in such mirth that 
none who heard or saw could think there was a possi- 
bility of her father losing his crown or of the nation 
being in a state of civil war." 

Lady Churchill's next step was to influence 
Anne to forego her claim to the crown in favor 
of William. In her " Account of her Con- 
duct," written years after, she tells us that she 
was then " so very simple a creature " as never 
to guess King William's real design in coming 
to England. 

" Having never read, nor employed my time in any- 
thing but playing cards, and having no ambition myself, 
I imagined that the Prince of Orange's sole design was 
to provide for the safety of his own country by obliging 
King James to keep the laws of ours; and that he 
would go back as soon as he had made us all happy." 

The Duchess of Marlborough as a type of 
guileless simplicity is very amusing, but it is

probably true that William did deceive her as 
well as her husband and many another of 
James's whilom friends. How the " glorious 
Revolution " dwindles, when Mr. MoUoy shows 
us the men behind the issue, from a great blow 
struck at tyranny to a clever bit of political 
chicanery foisted by the crafty William upon 
a bewildered and unsuspecting people — a 
cow/> d'etat almost as dramatic and quite as 
unprincipled as Napoleon's of the eighteenth 
Brumaire I 

In spite of the services Lord and Lady 
Marlborough had rendered in securing William 
his throne, they straightway fell out of favor 
for their violent partisanship of Anne. Lady 
Marlborough's dismissal shortly became the 
bone of contention between the two royal sis- 
ters, who ceased wrangling over it only when 
Mary died. Then William, who "entered 
into the quarrels of women as if he had been 
one," saw fit to patch up a reconciliation, which 
was empty and formal, and was followed, 
both for the Princess and her favorite, by just 
such slights and insults as had preceded it. 
All this must have been exceedingly trying to 
the high-spirited Sarah, who assures us, how- 
ever, that she was not glad at hearing of 
William's death, — " so little is it in my na- 
ture to retain resentment against any mortal 
(however unjust soever he may have been) 
in whom the will to injure is no more." In 
view of later events we commend the Duchess's 
sincerity in adding the final clause. 

With the accession of Anne begins the most 
familiar and likewise the most brilliant chap- 
ter of the Duchess's story. As she herself 
puts it : 

" From this time I began to be looked upon as a 
person of consequence, without whose approbation, at 
least, neither places, nor pensions, nor honours were be- 
«towed by the Crown. The intimate friendship with 
which the Queen was known to honour me, afforded a 
plausible foundation for this opinion. And I believe 
therefore it will be a surprise to many to be told that 
the first important step which Her Majesty took after 
her accession to the government was against my wishes 
and inclination; I mean her throwing herself and her 
affairs almost entirely into the hands of the Tories." 

Whatever the " many " may have thought 
of Anne's mild self-assertion. Lady Marlbor- 
ough's surprise was genuine and her displeas- 
ure too keen to be afPected by any obligation 
that Anne's munificent bounty could bind upon 
her. The war of words that followed between 
poor peace-loving Anne and the haughty in- 
tolerant Duchess is very vividly presented by 
means of extracts from their letters or bits of 



the gossip that buzzed about the court with 
reference to their stormy meetings. Increas- 
ingly turbulent interviews and impertinent 
letters marked the stages of the famous quar- 
rel which raged for four weary years and rent 
the whole court in twain. Finally the Queen, 
sick of lectures and reprimands, forbade the 
Duchess the court. The long and unpopular 
reign of the Marlboroughs was over. The 
Duchess, furious at her husband's counsel of 
mildness, flung her keys of o£Bce at the Duke's 
head and he carried them to Anne, who a few 
months later wrote him that he too was dis- 
missed from her service. 

But though thus summarily stripped of her 
power, neither the distaste for court life which 
she declares she had felt ever since she was 
fourteen, nor her advancing years, brought 
the indomitable Duchess any desire for peace 
or real retirement. To the end of her days 
she was busy, like Martha before her, about 
many things ; " though her activity was not 
productive of peace or good will to any man." 
We get a very vivid picture of her old age, 
spent in marrying off her granddaughters, 
acting as nurse and purser to the Duke, or 
swearing at his physician, quarrelling with her 
daughters, reviling Anne and the Georges in- 
discriminately, husbanding her vast wealth, 
and publishing first a lively " Account of her 
Conduct," and then a vindication of the afore- 
said " Account " and of her character in gen- 
eral from the storm of condemnation her first 
book had drawn upon her. So did the first 
Duchess of Marlborough continue to war with 
the world until she left it ; the art of which 
she had most perfect control being that of 
making enemies. 

No brief review of " The Queen's Comrade " 
can do it real justice, for its chief charm is its 
detail. The interest is well sustained and 
pungently spiced with variety. It is meant 
for leisurely, luxurious reading, which it well 
repays ; but it is made available to the student 
in search of a particular point by the very co- 
pious synopses that head the chapters.

Standards of Typographic Taste.* 

Printing, as ordinarily practised, is a mere 
question of craftsmanship, like stone-cutting, 
or wood-carving, or a score of other trades. 
But, just as the line that separates the stone- 
cutter from the sculptor, or a Swiss peasant from 
an Andreas Zorn, is a difficult one to draw, 
so printing proceeds by stages infinitesimally 
small from the status of a post-mediaeval mys- 
tery to that of a handicraft, and finally to that 
of a fine art. Indeed, taken in connection 
with its kindred perplexities of type-founding, 
paper- making, and book-binding, it was the one 
art that fairly baffled the genius of William 
Morris, the one over which he never obtained 
complete mastery. 

Of late years there has been a woeful falling 
off from typographical excellence on one hand, 
and a most determined attempt to revive its an- 
cient glories on the other. The renascence of 
the ars conservatrix was at first complicated by 
the endeavor to do too much, — to substitute for 
modest and simple excellence in typography an 
effect that was largely decorative or pictorial. 
It was here that Morris made his most conspicu- 
ous failure, ^hat time of experimental groping 
was succee^^ by a series of more or less doleful 
imitators of the work of the Kelmscott Press, 
some of whom have not yet gone to their reward 
in the limbo reserved for false prophets. Many 
of our ambitious workers and self-imagined ex- 
perts have yet to learn that the best printing fol- 
lows the good old rule embodied in the phrase 
ars celare artem; and they must learn it in the 
good old school of experience. Nothing, per- 
haps, is better suited to bring a neophyte to 
some degree of typographical connoisseurship 
than some of the monstrosities that pass for fine 
books among a sadly misled class to-day, — ill- 
shaped pages printed on pretentious and inap- 
propriate paper, from grotesque or freakish 
type, with poor ink unevenly applied, and given 
to the world in flimsy or tawdry binding, a work 
un-proof-read, unregistered, and inept. Such 
poisonous-looking volumes have a single merit : 
they carry with them their own antidote to all 
discerning minds.

But the love of luxury which grows with 
increasing wealth demands excellence, since 
it can afford to pay for it ; and in England 
and the United States printers who retain 
for themselves the noble simplicity of the best 
traditions of their art are striving worthily 
to supply this new demand. Mr. Cobden- 
Sanderson, with the newly established Doves 
Press in England, and in this country the 
De Vinne Press in New York, and the special 
book-making department established in 1899 
at the Riverside Press in Cambridge under 
the direction of Mr. Bruce Rogers, are the 
most notable examples of this praiseworthy 
movement. It is with three notable volumes 
put forth this season by Messrs. Houghton, 
Miffin & Co. at the latter press, that we are 
now concerned. 

" Obermann," the masterpiece of Etienne 
Pivert de Senancour, is known to English- 
speaking people chiefly through the two poems 
of Matthew Arnold which bear the name of 
Senancour's book, and those others that attest 
its influence. This work, almost inaccessible 
even to the few to whom it makes its timid but 
passionate appeal, and, when obtained, found 
to hold between its covers much that has lost 
its savor " in this our troubled day," is an 
ideal book to be issued in selections and in a 
fastidious edition, with discreet editorial super- 
vision. Accordingly, Miss Jessie Peabody 
Frothingham, pleasantly remembered for her 
translation of the " Journal " of Maurice de 
Guerin, has rendered the vital portions of 
" Obermjmn " into English, prefixing a critical 
and biographical essay on the author and his 
work, and adding copious notes that reveal her 
width of reading and keenness of critical per- 
ception. 

This is the first of the three volumes under 
consideration. Xavier de Maistre's widely 
known and greatly admired " Voyage autour 
de ma Chambre " is the second. Popular as 
this book is, and justly so, among those of 
literary judgment, it is known chiefly through 
the repeated editions of it that have been pre- 
pared for the use of school-children . Ad j udging 
it worthy of a better fate, Professor de Su- 
michrast of Harvard University has written a 
charming little preface for this new edition, 
from that authorized in France, in which he 
says, among other things : 

" ' U ne s'^tait pas dont6,' dit Sainte-Beuve, ' qu'il devenait 
durant ce temps-l^, un de nos anteurs les plus connus et lea

pas avoir sonpgonn^ I'ezistence, qa'efit-il pens^, qa'eQt-il dit

Jacqaes Roasseaa, — les premiers jours da vingti^me si^cle 
verraient la pablication d'ane edition de laze de son ' Voyage 
4iatoar de ma Chambre ' ? " 

The third of these books needs no introduc- 
tion, since it has steered its way successfully 
for a long generation between the semi-oblivion 
of slender appreciation and the merciless popu- 
larity of a text-book. This is " Mr. Brown's 
Letters to a Young Man about Town," con- 
tributed by Thackeray to the columns of 
*' Punch " during the year 1849. These letters, 
addressed by an elder among men of the world 
to one just about to enter upon the pleasant 
life of the leisure class, are as witty and sound 
to-day as when first published, and abundantly 
deserve the characterization given them by 
James Hannay, quoted in the publishers' note, 
as being "inimitable, wise, easy, playful, worldly 
social sketches." Most fit, like the other books 
mentioned, are such writings for a limited 
edition suited to their luxurious content. 

So much for the literary and intellectual side 
of these three works ; we will speak briefly of 
the habiliments in which they are clad. " Ober- 
mann " is printed in two volumes, in a style 
following closely, but without servility, that in 
vogue in France at the time of their publication 
a century ago. The heavy unsmoothed paper, 
the clear print, the complete absence of decora- 
tion and color, the perfect registering of the 
pages, the accurate and intelligent proof- 
reading, the chaste binding in heavy cadet- 
blue paper with paper labels on the back, all 
combine to give the book a pleasing aus- 
terity of appearance in happy harmony with its 
•contents. 

In de Maistre's book more of decoration is 
permissible. The frontispiece is a likeness of 
the author, from a portrait hitherto unpublished. 
The title-page is printed from an engraving on 
copper by Mr. Sidney L. Smith, after the man- 
ner of the eighteenth century. Engraved head- 
pieces, and half-title vignettes and tail-pieces 
from wood, are employed with good effect. The 
initials, in rococo style, are rubricated. Where 
*' Obermann " has the effect of chasteness and 
austerity, this volume is more light and fanciful. 
The vellum back alone seems out of complete 
harmony. 

Thackeray's book is bound in boards, like 



the others, but these are covered with a marbled 
paper in S-shaped sworls, admirably old fash- 
ioned, — even, like the " Letters," to the point 
of the sentimental. A vignette, in a manner 
not unlike Thackeray's own, decorates the title- 
page. The type and paper reflect the feeling 
of the book to a remarkable degree, and the 
whole effect is finely and completely har- 
monious. 

It is a pity that some benevolently disposed 
person, in an age when money for libraries is 
flowing in millions, cannot establish small 
collections of these correctly made books at in- 
tervals throughout the land, for the purpose of 
establishing comparisons, and cultivating typo- 
graphic taste. Wallace Rice. 



The iNxrsGS of the Animai^s.* 



The hunting instinct is by no means eradi- 
cated from the human breast, though it plays 
but little part, directly, in the economy of the 
civilized life of to-day. The old habit still 
lurks in our veins, and most of us follow a good 
animal story with something of the zest of the 
chase. Authors — and publishes too — have 
found this out ; and, following in the wake of 
" The Jungle Books " and " Wild Animals I 
Have Known," come new claimants for our in- 
terest. 

Some naturalists and more scientists are 
half inclined to quarrel with this newly-fledged 
method of depicting animal life, and some 
would even relegate the whole anthropomor- 
phic menagerie to the forests of Wonderland. 
Mr. Seton-Thompson seems to have heard of 
these criticisms, for in the preface of his latest 
collection of stories, "Lives of the Hunted," 
he takes particular pains to state that " The 
material of these accounts is true. The chief 
liberty taken is in ascribing to one animal the 
adventures of several." Nevertheless, we note 
that a particularly interesting adventure of 
" Johnny," the dyspeptic bear cub of Yellow- 
stone Park, is told by Mr. Seton-Thompson —

and it looses nothing in the telling — on the 
authority " of three bronzed mountaineers." It 
is obviously unfair to ask for an extension of 
the list of authorities. It is equally unfair to 
fail to recognize the fund of animal lore from 
which the material of these tales is drawn. They 
should not, however, be judged as scientific re- 
ports upon the habits and instincts of animals 
where unvarnished fact and cold logic admit of 
no embellishment for the reader's delectation. 
They are essentially and primarily stories with 
an underlying basis of fact and observation. In 
any case, the court of final appeal is open, and 
we can all take to the woods and plains and ob- 
tain a first-hand acquaintance with their furred 
and feathered denizens. The stories in Mr. 
Seton-Thompson's present collection include 
his recent as well as some of his earlier con- 
tributions to periodical literature. Krag, 
Biddy and Randy, Johnny Bear, Tito, Chink, 
and the Kangaroo Rat, are most of them old 
friends ; and whether old or new are sure of 
a welcome from hosts of readers among the 
children of all ages. In the humor and the 
human element which this author finds in his 
animal friends, lies one of the secrets of his 
well-deserved popularity. 

In Mr. Frazer's " The Outcasts " we have an 
example of what a fellow-writer is pleased to 
call " the archaic method, making the animals 
talk." His theme is the origin of the Wood 
Buffalo, the surviving herd of American bison 
in the forests of Athabasca. The characters are 
A'tim the outcast dog-wolf, and Shag the old 
bull driven from the herd. The portrayal, 
which at times is Kiplingesque, may be true to 
life, but as a story it lacks humor entirely, and 
the chief actors are not pleasing additions to 
one's animal acquaintances. The grim horror 
of the struggle for life is the main impression 
to be derived from the book, while the springs 
of the reader's sympathy are not touched as by 
the work of Kipling and Seton-Thompson. 

The tales which Mr. Foster has gathered 
together under the title " In the Forest " deal 
with the larger beasts of the woods. They are 
in some cases biographies in which the animal 
traits, good and evil alike as judged by human 
standards, are portrayed with equal faithful- 
ness, and withal with force and vividness. The 
ring of genuineness and the spirited treatment 
add further charm to these tragic tales of wood- 
land life. Perhaps it is true, as Mr. Seton- 
Thompson has said, that the only way to make 
an animal's history un-tragic is to stop before 
the last chapter. 



Mr. Dallas Lore Sharp's " Wild Life near 
Home " belongs in a somewhat different cate- 
gory of animal books. These sketches recount 
the rambles of a naturalist whose sharp eyes 
and indefatigable patience have brought to 
light much of interest concerning the birds and 
fishes, rabbits and opossums, muskrats and 
squirrels, in their haunts in the fields, woods, 
and swamps of New Jersey. The book follows 
the conventional lines of nature-books, but with 
more than the usual diversity of theme and with 
exceptional vivacity of style. 

The illustration of nature books has come 
to be a fine art, — indeed, a very special fine 
art. In the books here reviewed we have the 
work of several artists, exemplifying as many 
methods. The stilted wood-cuts of our older 
natural histories look strangely out of place be- 
side the work of the artists of to-day. The 
pictures in " The Outcasts " are the least ef- 
fective. They are stiff and wooden, and one 
instinctively looks for evidence of the taxider- 
mist's work. The illustrations by Rungius for 
" In the Forest " are very spirited, full of ac- 
tion, and wonderfully life-like, though the one 
entitled " The Yearling Buck " is evidently in- 
correctly named. In " Lives of the Hunted '* 
the author is the illustrator — a rare and most 
effective combination. These illustrations are 
as unique as the text. Their great effective- 
ness lies in the suggestiveness of the drawings 
— the greater at times by reason of their some- 
what hidden meaning. Mr. Sharp's work is 
abundantly illustrated by Mr. Bruce Horsfall 
with much delicacy and skill, the artistic finish 
of the work standing in strong contrast to the 
few bold lines of Mr. Seton-Thompson's mar- 
ginals and tail-pieces. The two books last 
named are fine examples of the bookmaker's 
art, showing taste and skill in every detail.

Stories of the English IjAkes.*

of thi8 region from such different points of 
view as to be mutually supplementary, includ- 
ing, as they do, little in common. If both of 
the books are to be at one's disposal, Mr. 
Bradley's " Highways and Byways in the Lake 
District " should be read first, not because it 
is the more important or the more enjoyable, 
but because it gives the necessary understand- 
ing of the country and the life of the people. 
A map in the back of the volume, and the 
characteristic drawings of Mr. Joseph Pennell, 
of which there are some eighty or ninety, help 
very much to a vivid realization of scenes and 
places. It is a region of but little more than 
thirty miles square, and yet there is crowded 
in it so much of lake and river, of mountain, 
brook, and fell, that, but for the author's ani- 
mated showing, it would be hard to believe 
that all of its localities are genuinely interest- 
ing. Keswick, Skiddaw, Derwentwater, Shap 
Fell, Carlisle, — names known and unknown, — 
follow one another so rapidly that only the 
author's easy literary art saves us from confu- 
sion. Many of the places he fastens in our 
memories indelibly by a telling story or a 
characteristic anecdote. Here on the border 
of Scotland there were stirring deeds for many 
centuries ; and indeed, to say nothing of the 
border warfare, the annals of the internal affairs 
of this part of the country are not lacking in 
dramatic interest. 

" It is Cicely, the yonngest of all these, that with 
pale face and golden hair now looks down on us from 
the window in Penrith church. She was a famous and 
haughty beauty, well-known in London, where she was 
commonly styled « proud Cis of Raby.' Her chief claim 
to notoriety, however, lies in the distinction acquired 
by her marriage and her motherhood. For she became 
the wife of Richard Duke of York, the Yorkist heir- 
presumptire to the English throne, and mother of Ed- 
ward IV. and Richard III. The first was captured at 
the battle of Wakefield and hurried instantly to the 
block, and his head, decorated with a paper crown, im- 
paled on York gates. Their son. Lord Rutland, on this 
same occasion, begged on his knees for mercy from the 
Black Clifford, the fiercest member of the strenuous 
Westmoreland line. « As your father killed mine,* cried 
the ' northern wolf,' plunging his dagger into the boy's 
breast, ' so will I kill you.' Richard Duke of Clarence, 
too, who was slain by Edward IV., was Cicely's brother. 
She herself was grandmother to Henry the Seventh's 
Queen, while her nephew Warwick the kingmaker suc- 
ceeded to this same manor of Penrith, where he kept 
prodigious state." 

Castle, church, village, all call up legend or 
more recent story, and each takes color from 
Mr. Bradley's ready understanding of the spirit 
of time and place. 

In the new edition of the " Literary Asso- 



ciations of the English Lakes," first published 
in 1894, Canon Rawnsley touches not so much 
upon the scenes and their historic interest, as 
upon the lives of men of letters who have spent 
here a day or a month or a year. Wordsworth 
and Southey are perhaps the heroes of the 
book, and it seems at times that the writer's 
attitude toward them is, to say the least, not 
seriously critical. He quotes commonplace 
lines from Wordsworth very freely, and seems 
not to have any idea of the feeling about the 
poet which Mr. Bradley expresses : 

" One may be permitted, I think, some disappoint- 
ment that Wordsworth seems to have been almost in- 
different to the moving pageants of history, the passions, 
the humours and the pathos of olden days. It is nothing 
that he wrote a few unremarkable poems on such sub- 
jects, or published a guide-book which deals chiefly with 
landscape detail and breaks ultimately into verse. Nor 
will the few notes he has left on manners and customs 
seem of much moment when compared with the ampler 
evidence of local antiquaries and historians. How much 
is Wordsworth read nowadays ? — if such a question in 
snch a spot is permissible. How many of the younger 
generation have worked conscientiously through * The 
Excursion'? ... It is not in the least strange that 
wherever in the Lake Country yon find a man or 
woman of literary tastes you find an enthusiastic dis- 
ciple of the Rydal bard; but their pious belief that suck 
devotion is common to all Anglo-Saxondom is more 
noteworthy." 

The list of literary celebrities who have 
been in some way connected with the Lake 
Region is a long one ; and whether they came 
for a chance view, for a vacation ramble, or 
for the purpose of establishing a home, we 
here make acquaintance with them in an inti- 
mate fashion. What we learn of each is always 
significant. 

In the putting together of so many things 
unrelated save for the fact of a common place 
of action, it inevitably results that the reader 
feels the lack of some unifying thread of nar- 
rative or of argument. Here came Shelley 
with his young wife, and here the poet-reformer 
grew to have a bitter aversion for Southey. 
Christopher North the hearty and happy, 
Coleridge the mystical, Carlyle the strenuous 
and prophetic, Matthew Arnold the polished, 
and Gray the delicate, met here, drawn by a 
common interest. The company is a motley 
one, but the keen observer will not fail to 
get many new items of understanding of those 
that come and pass. In the presence of the 
mountains and the lakes, each man becomes 
himself, and the best and the worst in him be- 
comes clear to us as the face of nature.

r No figure in contemporary art-history is more 
imposing than Professor Hubert von Herkomer, 
B.A. It is therefore quite fitting that the most 
distinguished of the art books of the season should 
be a study of his life and works (Macmillan). 
The volume is a truly magnificent super-royal 
quarto of one hundred and thirty-five pages, with 
special binding designed by Professor von Herko- 
mer himself, and illustrated with sixteen photo- 
gravure plates and about ninety half-tone blocks. 
As a sympathetic study of an unusual and versatile 
genius, nothing could be better than the text of Mr. 
A. L. Baldry. To the average mind, why and how 
an artist paints pictures or brings into existence 
great achievements in bronze or marble is an un- 
accountable mystery. In the general estimation, 
there is an uncanny touch of heredity in the way 
that an artist's personality stamps an odd family 
likeness upon everything that comes from his hand. 
The public, not understanding the facts of art, in- 
vests it with an array of fancies, and allows imag- 
ination to run riot in sentimental ideas about the 
men who can put their thoughts into a tangible 
form. The skilful biographer is he who shows 
there is a necessary and most intimate relation be- 
tween an artist's personality and his life-product, a 
vital connection of cause with effect, although not 
always written where he who runs may read. In 
the present case, this dissection — or, perhaps more 
properly, vivisection — is greatly satisfying. It 
gives us the clue to an understanding of a man who 
gives the lie to the old proverb about Jack-of-all- 
trades. It explains what are the elements, and 
how mixed, in this artist, that at one moment it is 
a portrait or a picture that engages him, at another 
it is an enamel, or he turns for awhile to music, 
teaches, lectures, does etchings, invents a new pro- 
cess of engraving, goes deeply into artistic crafts- 
manship, makes audacious innovations in theatrical 
art, and intrudes into many professions that ac- 
cording to the popular notion are quite outside his 
sphere. Eight chapters are given to the record of 
this varied activity year by year ; the two concluding 
chapters describe the unique Herkomer art colony 
in the English country village of Bushey, and the 
sumptuous dwelling he has built for himself there. 
But, unlike many of his brother artists, the building 
of this house was not through a desire to construct 
an impressive pedestal for himself, but through an 
almost devotional intention to be true to a tradition 
that has been handed down to him from his ances- 
tors. For, in the last analysis, pride of race is the 
leading motive in Herkomer's life. His wholly En- 
glish art is the production of a man who, in mind, 
habit, and temperament, is strongly and character- 
istically German. He is now in the best period of 
his maturity, with capacities highly trained, and a 
deep and comprehensive knowledge of the details 
of his profession. As there is no symptom of wan- 



ing in his energies or of weakening in his entha* 
siasm, his development in coming years is almost 
certain to be as significant as it has been during the 
time that has passed. 

To the supply of new editions of Shakespeare 
there seems to be practically no end. The latest 
comes from the house of Lippincott, consists of 
twenty handy volumes, and is called " The Twentieth 
Century Edition." The special feature of this edition 
lies in the numerous full-page illustrations, some 
forty in all, finely reproduced in colors from designs 
by prominent English illustrators of the day, in- 
cluding Mr. Byam Shaw, Mr. Patten Wilson, and 
others. Except for these illustrations, and the gor- 
geously decorative title-page, the books are severely 
simple in style, entirely lacking in critical comment- 
ary, and are issued without any editorial name. The 
only introduction to the respective plays consists of 
two lines — one giving the date of first publication, 
and another the number of acts, scenes, and lines. 
Each play is also provided with a glossary, and, 
where the folio or quarto text is obscure, a note 
stating on whose authority the present reading has 
been adopted. Numbered lines, and an index of 
Shakespearean characters with the plays in which 
they occur, are also useful features. The general 
appearance of the volumes, and their lightness in 
the hand, commend them ; and readers wearied with 
the over-weight of comment and of "editing" in 
some editions. of Shakespeare may find here a wel- 
come relief. 

Art lovers will give a warm welcome to the new 
and enlarged edition of Mr. W. C. Brownell's valu- 
able work on "French Art" (Scribner), with its 
forty-eight fine full-page illustrations of famous 
masterpieces, and a new chapter devoted to " Rodin 
and the Institute." The earlier edition closed with 
" The New Movement in Sculpture "; since that 
edition appeared nine years ago, this new movement 
has firmly established itself, with Auguste Rodin as 
its master spirit. The distinction between M. Rodin's 
art and the art of the Institute sculptors is well 
expressed by Mr. Brownell when he says : " The 
Institute is inspired by tradition and guided by 
nature ; Rodin is inspired by nature and guided by 
tradition." There can not be much doubt as to 
which type produces the higher art. To be guided 
by tradition is legitimate ; an originality that is a 
pure abstraction is characteristic of no great artist 
since the evolution of art began. Everything de- 
pends upon the way in which one makes use of his 
patrimony. There is an eternal opposition between 
using it in a routine and mechanical way, drawing 
the interest on it, so to speak, from time to time, 
on the one hand, and on the other reinvesting it 
according to the dictates of one's own feeling and 
faculty. The latter is what every great artist has 
done, and what M. Rodin is now doing. He has 
been called a French Michael Angelo ; but, with a 
temperament in some measure analogous to that of 
the great Florentine, his art is his own. Some of 
his figures are conceived in somewhat the same

spirit as Angelo's, bat they are never ran in the 
same moald. Both the old portions and the new 
of this beaatifal volume are fall of fiae and jast 
criticisms of art, and the illastrations place it among 
the best of the season's art-books. 

The ^' Other Famous Homes of Great Britain and 
their Stories " (Putnam) will find an eager public 
awaiting it, the two earlier books of the same series 
having won a host of friends. Like its predecessors, 
the present volume is edited by Mr. A. H. Malan, 
the separate descriptive articles being written either 
by the owners of the homes, or by those closely as- 
sociated with the reigning families. Great Britain, 
by favor of her governing class, possesses artistic 
treasures — pictures, sculptures, and articles of 
virtu — in a series of private galleries which no 
other country can hope to rival. What yoanger 
nations, later in their awakening to artistic life, are 
striving to do in their museums and public galleries 
has already been done by the aristocracy of En- 
gland in their own homes. They have lavished 
their wealth upon the purchase of sculpture and 
pictures, and with a generous hospitality have, in a 
large sense, made them the property of the public. 
Scattered throughout the length and breadth of the 
land, these stately homes stand with doors open to 
the student, the owners and occupiers regarding 
themselves as trustees and custodians for the public 
weal. The descriptions of twelve of these ancestral 
houses, with their traditions, their treasures, and 
their architectural and picturesque features, are 
illustrated by about two hundred photographic 
plates, making a traly sumptuous as well as in- 
stractive volume. 

"New Tales of Old Rome" (Houghton) is the 
newest of that delightful series of archaeological 
books on Rome which, from time to time during the 
last dozen years, have come from the pen of Mr. 
Rodolfo Lanciani. In this volume the author's his- 
torical and archaeological researches are brought 
down to date, and classified under eight different 
heads, as follows : The New Discoveries in the 
Forum, The New Discoveries of the Sacra Via, 
The Sacred Grove of the Arvales, The Truth 
about the Grave of St. Paul, Strange Superstitions 
in Rome, Jewish Memorials in Rome, Scottish Me- 
morials in Rome. The present campaign of ex- 
ploration is one which will remain memorable for- 
ever in archaeological records of the Eternal City. 
Former undertakings seldom touched the deepest 
levels, but this new movement has for its object to 
reach the early imperial, the republican, the kingly, 
and even the prehistoric strata, wherever it is pos- 
sible to do so without special injury to the later and 
higher structures. In the course of the work, many 
important discoveries have been made, the most im- 
portant being a cenotaph which Professor Lanciani 
believes to be the veritable national monument 
of Romulus, the founder of the city, raised not 
long after his death. This discovery is regarded 
by the author as a distinct victory for the conserva- 
tive body of stadents, to which he has always be- 



longed — even at a time " when a lecturer could not 
name the founder of the city as a man who had actu- 
ally existed, without blushing before his audience." 
The history of ancient Rome cannot longer be 
written in the distrustful spirit of the hypercritical 
school. The twenty-three full-page plates and the 
one hundred and seventeen illustrations in the text 
are important features of this learned and beautiful 
work. 

A romantic interest always attaches to lands of 
which not very much is known ; and hence from 
the earliest times the countries of Scandinavia have 
been invested with a peculiar charm. As long ago 
as Tacitus, we find it written : " Here the light of 
the setting sun lingers on until sunrise, bright enough 
to dim the light of the stars. More than that, it is 
asserted that the sound of his rising is to be heard, 
and the forms of the gods and the glory round his 
head may be seen." For hundreds of years stories 
such as these, and others, of the battles between 
grods and giants, were repeated at Norse firesides 
in the long winter evenings ; and at last, more than 
one thousand years after Tacitus, they were brought 
together in books known as the Eddas. These an- 
cient books, which a brave and noble race carried 
in its heart through all its wide wanderings and 
conquests, take one back to the beginning of time, 
and tell of the birth of the worlds and the coming 
of the gods to rule over them. Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead, & Co. have this year given us a new collection 
of these " Norse Stories," re-told by Mr. Hamilton 
Wright Mabie in a very pleasant way, and illustrated 
by ten colored plates and marginal decorations on 
each page by Mr. Greorge Wright. There are seven- 
teen of these tales, beginning with " The Making 
of the World " and the creation of man. Out of 
the ash and the elm trees were created the first 
human pair, the gods calling the man Ask and the 
woman Embla. The last two stories are " The 
Twilight of the Gods " and " The New Earth." 

We are continually hearing that all the good work 
of the world, whether in literature, music, or art, be- 
longs to the past, — to which frequently is added the 
corollary that none of it exists or has existed in 
America. Especially when American art is in ques- 
tion it is likely to be set aside as briefly as '■^ Snakes 
in Iceland " in the famous treatise. But that there is 
no American art will be hard to prove after reading 
Mr. Sadakishi Hartmann's two delightful volumes, 
"A History of American Art" (Page), with its 
sixty-six reproductions of sculpture and painting 
from American hands. In most cases each artist is 
represented by but one picture, the exceptions being 
three from C. J. Brush, and two each from Hunt,

[Dec. 1, 



Bcientious recognition that there is a nobler and far 
more difficult mission compulsory upon the critic, 
namely, to seek out and set forth the innermost 
essence of every work, — the thought the artist has 
endeavored to express. 

The lives of all great men furnish interesting 
stories in connection with their labors, but it is quite 
a surprise to find how often these have appealed to 
artists as subjects for pictures. Last year, Mr. "Wal- 
ter Rowlands published two volumes devoted re- 
spectively to the musicians and the authors; now 
we have from the same hand " Among the Great 
Masters of Painting " and " Among the Great Mas- 
ters of Oratory " (Dana Bates & Co.) which carry 
on the same scheme and are equally fascinating and 
instructive. In dealing with the artists, the unique 
feature is that instead of reproductions of their own 
works we have some incident in their lives as con- 
ceived by the imagination of some brother-artist of 
a much later generation. Phidias giving a " private 
view " to Pericles and Aspasia of his newly-com- 
pleted frieze of the Parthenon, by Alma-Tadema ; 
Cimabue's Madonna carried in procession through 
the streets of Florence, by Sir Frederick Leighton ; 
Raphael and Michael Angelo in the Vatican, by 
Horace Vernet, — these are instances of the nature 
of the pictures, while the text recalls the attending 
circumstances and gives some account of the modern 
artist. In " Among the Great Masters of Oratory," 
the text is naturally devoted chiefly to quotations 
from the respective " Masters," the range being 
through a list extending from Demosthenes to Lin- 
coln, Beaconsfield, and Gladstone. There are thirty- 
two illustrations in each volume, and in all respects, 
exterior and interior, these books will please the fas- 
tidious. 

There have been seven English editions of the 
famous work by W. Hepworth Dixon called " Her 
Majesty's Tower." But there is still room for the 
American holiday edition of Messrs, Crowell & Co., 
issued under a new name — "The Tower of Lon- 
don." The subject is of course perennially inter- 
esting, both to students of history and of literature. 
The Tower colors Shakespeare's page, casts a mo- 
mentary gloom over Bacon's story, and Raleigh's 
History of the World was evolved in its gloomy 
vaults. By turns a prison, a palace, and a court, 
the whole edifice is alive with story — the story of 
a nation's highest splendor, its deepest misery, and 
its darkest shame. But if the imagination needs 
any aid in such a case, it is here abundantly sup- 
plied by sixty choice illustrations, largely new, and 
representing a truly wide range of research, often 
in private galleries not easily accessible to the pub- 
lic. From the collection of His Majesty King 
Edward VII., at Windsor, we have portraits of 
Queen Elizabeth as a young Princess, two portraits 
of Anne Boleyn, the Holbein portraits of Henry 
VIII. and Thomas Howard third Duke of Nor- 
folk, and Van Dyck's Charles I. Hatfield House, 
Sherbourne Castle, and Montague House have fur- 
nished other pictures, while the list of artists rep- 



resents nearly every European nationality in addi- 
tion to the English names. 

In " A Child of Nature " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), 
Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie tells a very sweet and 
touching story of an unsuccessful life — as the world 
counts success. As a lad, John Foster seemed set 
apart and alone in his fellowship with Nature, 
while all his neighbors were fighting the stubborn 
fields inch by inch ; if he had ambitions, he never 
spoke of them; there was no touch of romance in 
the work or in the home ; there were few books to 
read, and these, with a single exception, had nothing 
to say to the boy who had found that another and 
a finer crop could be taken o£P the farm, if one knew 
how to harvest it. His discovery of the heart in 
Nature came to him very young ; later he grew 
into a sense of the Universal Spirit, and lived in 
the light which has shone on the path of every poet 
since time began. He dwelt in the creative mood, 
although the power to create was denied him. But, 
in the end, every man comes to his own. With 
John Foster, this was only years after his death, 
when another man, a kindred spirit, found in the 
old farm-house the loose sheets which bore the faint 
and disconnected tracings of Foster's inarticulate 
experience. With the generosity of a fine spirit, 
the young man interpreted the life of the older man 
through the rich atmosphere of his own tempera- 
ment ; thus at last the life sown in secret bore 
harvest in the wide field of the world. Illustrations, 
in photogravure, and decorations are provided for 
this volume by Mr. Charles Louis Hinton, and none 
more refined and beautiful are to be found than on 
these artistic pages. 

It has often happened that a novelist or poet, by 
the sheer force of his creative imagination, has 
given vitality to regions otherwise almost unknown 
and quite dead. In this way, Mr. Thomas Hardy 
has resuscitated, one may even say recreated, the 
old half- forgotten kingdom of Wessex in England. 
Before his time, those who used this term at all 
were thinking of a land made memorable by the 
ravages of a horde of sea-borne adventurers who 
gradually drove before them the earlier possessors 
of the country-side. But Wessex as a living, 
breathing reality, Wessex as a part of nineteenth- 
century life, sprang first into existence under the 
touch of the magic wand of its novelist. Accord- 
ingly, Mr. Hardy's ardent admirer, Mr. Bertram 
C. A. Windle, assisted by the artist Mr. Edmund 
H. New, has issued a goodly octavo of three hun- 
dred and twenty-five pages called " The Wessex of 
Thomas Hardy" (Lane), text and pictures combin- 
ing to identify the localities of the different tales. 
The plan of the book is to take readers to the scenes 
where the stories are laid, and when there to allow 
Mr. Hardy himself to describe them. There are 
those who do not care greatly for his type of rustics ; 
there are those who dislike his themes ; but there are 
few who will deny that when he writes of scenery 
and of nature he is almost unrivalled. Therefore 
these twenty chapters of commentary, with their

illastrations, maps, and with their incidental refer- 
ences to the tragedy and comedy of the novels as 
each place is visited, famish forth an attractive and 
asefal volume, and one freed from the occasional 
unpleasantness of this master of English fiction. 

To old and young, to the wise and the simple, the 
collection of oriental tales known as the '' Arabian 
Nights' Entertainments " has for many generations 
afforded a source of abounding delight. The French 
were its first translators among Europeans, and 
through them our first English versions were ob- 
tained. The first complete translation of the " Ara- 
bian Nights " direct from the Arabic into English 
was that made by Mr. E. W. Lane, about the mid- 
dle of the present century ; the first attempt among 
English artists to portray the life and customs of 
the mysterious East as unfolded in these stories was 
that of Mr. Stanley "Wood. But these pictures were 
made for a limited edition, while Mr. Lane's monu- 
mental work was published without illustrations. 
To combine this test and these illustrations in a 
popular edition is to supply a real want ; and this 
has now been done by the publishing house of J. M. 
Dent & Co. (New York: Macmillan). The work 
consists of six volumes, has a hundred illustrations 
in photogravure, is neatly but simply bound, and 
is handsome enough to serve as a gift for anyone 
who has grown a bit tired of psychological introspec- 
tion in fiction, and who will be glad to return for 
awhile to the harem or the caliph's court "in the 
golden prime of good Haroun Alraschid." 

In one sense, Alphonse Daudet was the pioneer 
of the modern short story in France. At least he 
was the first to apply this form of literary art to a 
passing phase of thought, to a momentary emotion, 
and to incidents that are psychological in character 
rather than anecdotic. Reading life deeply, he 
found that the least important event is full of sol- 
emn significance, that the humblest life holds in 
itself potentially the elements of the sublimest 
drama, the profoundest tragedy. *'The least page 
he has ever written will preserve the vibration of 
his soul as long as onr language shall exist," said 
Zola at his grave. The new holiday edition of his 
best short stories, " Monday Tales " and " Letters 
from my Mill," published by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co., is as exquisite in outward appearance as in 
subject-matter. The " Monday Tales " are trans- 
lated by Miss Marian Mclntyre. To the " Letters 
from my Mill " are added " Letters to an Absent 
Ooe," both translated by Miss Katharine Prescott 
Wormeley. Each of the two volumes is supplied 
with four photogravure illustrations by such artists 
as Moreau, Avril, Bourgain, and Rossi. 

" A "Widow and her Friends " (Russell) is the 
title of Mr. C. D. Gibson's sixth book of published 
drawings. The " widow " is, of course, the " Gibson 
girl " in crepe garments, and perhaps just a little 
more charming in consequence. Her adventures 
occupy about half of the volume, the remainder 
being devoted to social satires of one kind or an- 
other. " Good wine needs no bush," nor do Mr. 



Gibson's drawings need any praise-words. That no 
one can do more with a few lines than Mr. Gibson, 
has been granted long ago ; and from those who 
care for his thendes there is sure to be instant de- 
mand for everything signed by his name. 

In "Travels Round Our 'Village" (Button), 
Miss Eleanor G. Hayden shows that she is mistress 
of the " art of putting things " by making an enter- 
taining book of three hundred and twenty pages out 
of what to most persons would appear material un- 
profitable to the last degree. Old-world customs 
and archaic forms of speech still linger in this Berk- 
shire village of rural England, whose name is not 
to be found in Bradshaw nor yet in the Postal 
Guide. Men there go about their tasks in a spirit 
of serene leisureliness ; the village touches the high- 
way only to fly from it again, as if in an excess of 
shyness. Yet even in such a sequestered corner 
there are humors, homely comedies, and simple 
pathos. Of these the author writes, believing it to 
be good in these days of bustle and strife to drift 
for awhile into some quiet backwater which the tide 
of progress stirs but just enough to avert stagnation. 
The leisurely reader will find much suited to his 
mood in this handsome volume, with its picturesque 
drawings by Mr. L. Leslie Brooke ; but lovers of the 
sensational or the thrilling may spare themselves 
the trouble of cutting its leaves. 

In " The Isle of the Shamrock " (Macmillan ) 
Mr. Clifton Johnson adds to a reputation already 
established by his previous volumes of a similar 
character entitled "Among English Hedgerows" 
and "Along French Byways." Mr. Johnson travels 
with his camera, and furnishes his own illustrations 
of poverty-stricken but picturesque Ireland. " A 
Knitter on the Highway," " A Farmyard Pump," 
" A Jaunting Car," the subjects of some of Mr. 
Johnson's photographs, are wayside pictures that 
hardly could be seen elsewhere. The author's diffi- 
culty in identifying the shamrock will appeal to 
all tourists who have had similar experiences. Al- 
though several of the chapters have had previous 
publication in various magazines, the book is not 
without unity, and is one of the pleasantest records 
of travel that has been offered this season. 

A Japanese author, Onoto "Watanna, and a Ja- 
panese artist, Genjiro Geto, have combined to pro- 
duce a book of rare beauty — "A Japanese Night- 
ingale" (Harper). From the charming colored 
frontispiece depicting the lovers with " the thousand 
petals of cherry blossoms falling about them " in 
the Japanese garden, to the end of the last chapter, 
there is a delightfully oriental flavor to the whole 
volume, which gives it a distinctive place in the 
holiday list. The story is unusual, the scene being 
laid almost entirely in Japan ; and after numerous 
tragic and pathetic episodes it finally ends happily. 
The admirers of " Madame Butterfly " will give 
this new work an equal place in their affections. 

Daintily bound in white and gold, and boxed 
together, come two volumes from Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co., "Jan Oxber " and "Love in Our "Vil-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



lage," by Orme Agnus. These are tales of rustic 
life in a remote English village, seven miles from 
any railway or telegraph station ; and the charac- 
ters use a curious dialect governed by no rules of 
grammar. But for him who has eyes to see, the 
peasant is something more than an awkward man 
with a sun-tanned face and wearing a smock. 
Village life has its palpitating dramas, and the ele- 
mental passions of mankind exist wherever men 
and women congregate, be it in obscure hamlets or 
crowded cities. They only await their chronicler 
of sufficient insight to behold and sufficient skill to 
set forth. Whether or no the village called " Bar- 
leigh " exists on any map, or the character of " Jan 
Oxber " ever existed outside of the author's imagi- 
nation, certainly this is a most touching and tender 
story. In the mean cottages of Barleigh shines 
the magic light that kings have desired in vain to 
see, and careworn faces are the masks of saints. 
The illustrator. Miss Bertha Newcome, has availed 
herself of the picturesque opportunities of these 
books with charming results. 

Upon the first publication of Motley's " Dutch 
Republic," forty-five years ago, it was recognized 
immediately as one of the most interesting histori- 
cal books ever written in any language. Few pre- 
vious historians had so united laborious scholarship 
with dramatic intensity. In truth, the work is 
essentially an epic, having William of Orange as 
its hero; and, like the ^aeid, recounts the fortunes 
of a noble nation. Consequently, after the lapse 
of nearly half a century Motley's work continues 
to hold its general popularity as well as the force 
of its appeal to cultivated minds. For many rea- 
sons, the new holiday library edition just issued by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. outranks all previous 
editions. An introduction by Professor John 
Franklin Jameson of Chicago University gives a 
summary of the principal events of interest in the 
life of Motley, and reveals the plan and underlying 
purpose of his writing; over fifty illustrations, 
many of them reproductions from rare portraits 
and famous paintings, help to a realization of the 
characters and scenes ; the colored map is probably 
the most elaborate one of the Netherlands yet 
printed in this country. This general literary and 
artistic excellence is sustained in the fit setting 
given the edition by the publishers. 

" Beasts of the Field " and '< Fowls of the Air" 
(Ginn & Co.) are the titles of two beautiful com- 
panion volumes that come side by side in a flat 
white box. The author of these books, Mr. William 
J. Long, is not a stranger to the nature-loving pub- 
lic ; indeed, these volumes include most of his pre- 
vious sketches dealing with life as it is lived by the 
animals in the woods and the fields, with enough 
of new material to give variety and a wider range 
of acquaintance with the Wood Folk. It is the 
human interest — if the paradox may be per- 
mitted — in these animal lives that strikes the key- 
note of these stories. Each animal is endowed 
with a distinctive personality, and a name borrowed 



from the Milicete Indian. For example, "Meeko 
the Mischief-Maker " is the red squirrel ; " Kagax 
the Bloodthirsty " is the weasel ; " Little Tookhees 
the 'Fraid One " is the wood-mouse, etc. In the 
marginal decorations, by Mr. Charles Copeland, 
each page shows us the creature in the performance 
of some characteristic act ; and this feature fur- 
nishes a continual artistic delight. There are also 
a dozen delightful full-page illustrations by the 
same hand. The volumes are dedicated to the 
teachers of America who are striving to make 
nature-study more vital and attractive by revealing 
a vast realm of Nature outside the realm of Science, 
and a world of ideas above and beyond the world 
of facts. 

Nearly half a century ago, when Charles Dick- 
ens was giving public readings from his own writ- 
ings, among the most popular of his selections both 
here and in England were those taken from " The 
Holly Tree." The public has always ranked this 
composition high among the minor writings of 
Dickens ; and now, bound together with his earlier 
Christmas story, "The Seven Poor Travellers," 
and copiously illustrated by Mr. C. E. Brock, this 
old favorite will rank high among the Christmas 
books of this year. The names of Dent of London 
and Lippincott of Philadelphia are a guarantee that 
nothing is wanting artistically. The introduction, 
by Mr. Walter Jerrold, sets forth the nature of the 
inspiration for the motive which Dickens frankly 
avowed in all his work. Granting that strained 
sentiment and unreal pathos may be found here and 
there in the wonderful series of Dickens's books, 
there are by no means wanting stories where the 
sentiment is as real as it is beautiful, and where 
the pathos is absolutely unquestionable. And even 
after making all deductions that the most captious 
critic can suggest, who can name a successor to 
Charles Dickens in the marvellous gift of telling 
tales for the Christmas-tide? 

Two new volumes of the " Thumb-Nail Series " 
(Century Co.) are entirely worthy of the good com- 
pany of their predecessors. Lincoln and Horace 
are the respective subjects of these volumes, and 
their unlikeness is indicated by the cover-design in 
each case — one modern and American in its sym- 
bolism, the other classic and poetic, but both daintily 
developed in stamped leather of the familiar coloring. 
The Lincoln volume consists of thirty-seven ex- 
tracts from his most famous speeches and lectures, 
prefaced by a sympathetic introduction by Mr. 
Richard Watson Gilder. Mr. Gilder has selected 
passages which show Lincoln at his literary best, 
namely, those that were uttered when he was 
dealing with a cause in which his whole heart was 
enlisted. Through all the prose of Lincoln's later 
life there runs, like a Leitmotif in music, a burden 
of high hope, touched with a heroism which is akin 
to pathos. — The " Odes of Horace," a hundred in 
number, selected by Mr. Benjamin E. Smith, are 
given in translations representing English authors 
of all periods, from Milton to Dobson and Father 



1901.]

Proat, and show how attractive Horace has been 
to the poets of saccessive generations. It was a 
happy thoaght to bring this little sheaf of ancient 
poems to modern hands in so acceptable a form. 
"Among Flowers and Trees with the Poets" 
(Lee & Shepard) conjures up all sorts of idyllic 
images ; and these are not shattered, but supple- 
mented, by the charming book of selections com- 
piled and arranged by Miss Minnie Curtis Wait 
and Professor Merton Channing Leonard. The 
original purpose of the volume was to place at the 
disposal of teachers a multitude of poems such as 
are needed in connection with nature-study, but 
which, from being so widely scattered, are not 
readily available. But the book will serve a much 
wider circle than this, and, indeed, will be wel- 
comed not only by all lovers of nature, to whom it 
is dedicated, but by all lovers of poetry as well. 
The poems are classified into six groups : Flowers, 
in General ; Flowers, Specified ; Trees and Shrubs, 
in General ; Trees and Shrubs, Specified ; Flower- 
less Plants ; National Flowers. There are sixteen 
full-page illustrations, the frontispiece being an 
illustration of the opening lines of Bryant's 
** Fringed Gentian " — 

*' Thon blossom bright with antnmn dew. 
And colored with the heaven's own blue." 

The latest addition to the " Travel-Lovers' Series " 
(Page) is a work on Florence, by the late Grant 
Allen. Illustrated with eighty photogravure and 
half-tone plates, bound in two volumes of white and 
gold, with cover design of Florentine symbolism, 
and neatly boxed, the familiar little hand-book is 
transformed into one of the choicest holiday books 
of the season. The text is well worthy of this new 
setting. Whoever undertakes to write about Flor- 
ence finds himself burdened by an embarassment 
of riches. But Mr. Allen's scientific order of mind, 
bis power of classification, and his ability to separate 
the essential from the non-essential, serve a good 
purpose here; and thus the arrangement of the 
book is of great value, whether one consults it as 
student or as traveller, or simply as a lovely picture- 
book. In looking through its pages one realizes 
anew the force of Shelley's lines : 

" Florence, beneath the son. 
Of cities, fairest one," 

" The Maids and Matrons of New France " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.), by Miss Mary Sifton Pep- 
per, is the story of the part played by women in 
the making of Canada. Twelve years before the 
Pilgrim Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock, a ban- 
ner bearing the lilies of France was planted on the 
headlands of Quebec. A comparison between these 
two companies of pioneer women, the Canadian 
gentlewomen and the Pilgrim mothers, would result 
in no discredit to the former. Although the French- 
women were dominated by strange superstitions and 
frequently inspired by supernatural visions, they 
never became slaves to witchcraft, as did their New 
England contemporaries. Many of them would even 
nowadays be looked upon as " emancipated " and 



" advanced." The author is well equipped for deal- 
ing with her subject, owing to similar works in the 
same field ; so that the book is important from an 
historical standpoint, and for the first time justice 
has been done to the brave and gentle women who 
made civilized life a possibility in a land of bar- 
barism. The illustrations, twenty in number, are 
mainly copied from authentic life-portraits. 

Abundant illustrations of excellent quality, be- 
sides a large number of colored maps, are features 
that serve to bring even so substantial and standard 
a work as Duruy's " General History of the World" 
into the category of Holiday publications, for which 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s new two-volume edi- 
tion is obviously intended. The two photogravure 
frontispieces and forty-odd plates in half-tone are 
copied from famous engravings and paintings, form- 
ing together a collection of much interest. The 
historical record is brought down to the present 
year, its continuation from 1848, where Duruy left 
it, having been made by Professor E. A. Grosvenor 
of Amherst College, who has performed this diffi- 
cult task, and also that of editing the entire work, 
with marked ability and success. It is a tribute to 
Duruy's great work that after more than half a 
century it still holds a place which no other world- 
history quite fills ; and this complete pictorial edi- 
tion will be deservedly prominent among the sea- 
son's books of the more solid and enduring sort. 

The picturesque costume and romantic adventure 
of colonial life in America furnish a fine field for 
the illustrator as well as the story-teller. That 
stirring novel of Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 — 
"White Aprons" (Little, Brown, & Co.), by Mrs. 
Maud Wilder Goodwin, gains in its already well- 
established favor by its half-dozen illustrations from 
different hands. The portrait of the heroine, Pen- 
elope Payne — a frontispiece in colors, by Mr. 
Thomas Mitchell Pierce, — is especially captivating. 

Mr. Paul Laurence Dunbar has already won 
wide recognition as a poet, using the dialect of his 
race. A selection of nine of these poems, bearing 
the name " Candle-Lightin' Time" (Dodd), beau- 
tifully illustrated with photographs by the Hampton 
Institute Camera Club, and with marginal decora- 
tions by Miss Margaret Armstrong, will be likely 
to win him fresh popularity. The book also reveals 
the great possibilities of artistic photography for 
purposes of illustration. No studied "composition " 
by the engraver or etcher could surpass some of 
these glimpses of picturesque nature, or the poses 
of the human figures. The three interiors and the 
one landscape of the opening poem — " Dinah 
Kneading Dough " — are enough to establish the 
artistic value of the book, and those following are 
equally good. 

Similar in subject and in dialect is the volume 
of " Plantation Songs " (Russell) by Mr. Eli Shep- 
perd. This too is illustrated by photographs from 
life, by Mr. J. N. Otis, reproduced in half-tone. 
Both these books are handsome and do great credit 
to their respective publishers ; but the differences 



448 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



between the two are, after all, very marked. Mr. 
Dunbar writes poetry ; Mr. Eli Shepperd writes 
more or less musical dialect verse. There is a 
♦' catchy " lilt in Mr. Shepperd's lines that possibly 
will win for them a place among classic negro mel- 
odies to be sung. The major part of the volume 
is given to " Hymns of the Black Belt " ; they show 
an intimate knowledge of the church-life of South- 
ern negroes, and are marked by artlessness and 
spontaneity. 

In the "Glories of Spain" (Macmillan), Mr. 
Charles W. "Wood writes as delightfully as in his pre- 
vious volume, " The Romance of Spain." Compara- 
tively few tourists visit the regions chiefly described 
in this volume, yet all who read it will certainly 
wish to do so. Whether one's interest be in archae- 
ology, architecture, picturesque scenery, history, or 
humanity, he will find good meat here. A land so 
old that it contained cities of a million inhabitants 
before the coming of Christ, and that it still uses as 
a prison the house once occupied by Pontius Pilate ; 
80 rich that for centuries Moors and Christians 
strove for its possession ; so beautiful that Byron and 
many other poets have made it the theme of song ; so 
happy in some ways, so unfortunate in others that 
it arouses us to sympathy whenever we speak the 
name, — these are the materials which both text and 
illustration serve to reveal in all their variety and 
charm. There are about eighty-five illustrations, 
and the book externally forms a fit setting for the 
content. 

The permanent value of Philip Gilbert Ham- 
erton's works on art is shown by the fact that 
among the multitude of entirely new books his 
writings are still sufficiently in demand to make 
re-publication desirable. Although more than thirty 
years have elapsed, his "Contemporary French 
Painters" and "Painting in France" are still 
charming and profitable reading. Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. have furnished the earlier volume 
with sixteen illustrations in photogravure, the front- 
ispiece being Bouguereau's "The Eldest Sister"; 
the later volume has fourteen illustrations, with 
Aubert's " The Flower " as frontispiece. French 
art will not be likely ever to have a more just as 
well as sympathetic interpreter than Hamerton. 

A more fortunate illustrator for Mr. Anthony 
Hope's " Dolly Dialogues " than Mr. Howard 
Chandler Christy could hardly have been chosen. 
The piquant personalities of " Dolly " and " Mr. 
Carter " seem thoroughly congenial to this artist's 
pen, and add to the already long list of his " fair 
women and brave men." Doubtless Mr. Hope's 
book will take on a new lease of popularity, with 
this edition, the publisher, Mr. R. H. Russell, hav- 
ing given it an attractiveness in form and execution 
that will satisfy the most fastidious of holiday 
purchasers. 

" Amos Judd " (Scribner) by Mr. John A. 
Mitchell, editor of " Life," is a story of love end- 
ing tragically, in which the interest centres around 
the occult power of the hero to foresee future 



events. Those who like to read with cold shivers 
chasing up and down the spine, may enjoy this 
book ; for it is well-written, sparkling and gay 
when it is not uncanny. This new edition is for- 
tunate in having for its illustrator Mr. A. I. Keller, 
whose eight drawings, reproduced in colors, do 
much to relieve the tension of the weird and mystic 
tale. 

Public interest in the great artistic crusade that 
marked the middle of the nineteenth century in 
England has never flagged, consequently it is not sur- 
prising that Mr. Percy Bate's " The English Pre- 
Raphaelite Painters" (Macmillan) should have 
reached a second edition. The letterpress has been 
carefully revised, completed, and brought up to 
date ; the illustrations include an even more com- 
plete and representative selection of pictures by 
the Brethren and their associates, with others by 
painters who were temporarily under their in- 
fluences, and still others of the most typical recent 
manifestations of Pre-Raphaelism. Among the lat- 
ter, Mr. Bate gives the place of prominence to the 
work of Messrs. Cayley Robinson and Byam Shaw. 
Mr. Shaw, though still young, has given evidence 
already of great technical accomplishment and 
daring in the use of pure color, along with an intense 
desire to express his theme clearly, with a distinct 
preference for subjects of a high poetic order. Mr. 
Robinson, on the other hand, is a dreamer of 
dreams, and a dweller in the twilight land of old 
romance. The author is convinced that the prin- 
ciples of Pre-Raphaelism remain as essentially true 
to-day as when first promulgated ; he feels, also, 
that there is reason to trust that the coming men 
may do as fine work as their forerunners. 

The noblest poem of religious faith in the En- 
glish language is Robert Browning's " Saul." It 
has been called a " Messianic oratorio in words." 
It is also a great picture-poem, and even a very 
unimaginative mind can hardly read it without con- 
juring a series of mental images. Such verse nat- 
urally attracts the illustrator, and more than ten 
years ago a large volume with photogravure illus- 
trations drawn by Mr. Frank 0. Small tempted the 
book-buyer of liberal purse. Now the same choice 
work is furnished to the more economical buyer by 
Messrs. T. Y, Crowell & Co. It is a duodecimo, 
bound in cloth with gilt top, beautiful paper and 
letter-press, and nineteen fascinating illustrations. 
In an introductory note of seventeen pages by Pro- 
fessor John Angus MacVannel of Columbia Uni- 
versity, Browning is classed with Wordsworth and 
Tennyson as a " consecrated voice," one of "God's 
truth-tellers." This poem, among Browning's re- 
ligious utterances, is described as expressing the 
attitude of the poet's middle life, while certain 
" Pauline " passages voice the early years, and the 
" Reverie " in " Asolando " the final confession of 
faith. To any lover of Browning this volume can- 
not fail to be a most acceptable gift.

have each reached the "Second Series," and in- 
clude a practically complete history of the stage in 
this country up to date. The present volumes differ 
from the first series in giving criticism prominence, 
rather than biography and anecdote. Thus, where 
noteworthy work has been done recently the same 
names occur that have been considered before, 
but this time with the stress laid upon their charac- 
terizations rather than upon their careers. Illus- 
trations representing each character in some favorite 
part add to the interest; but why the peacock 
design of the cover ? This is something which we 
can imagine might be repugnant to a serious-minded 
actor or actress. 

The Macmillan Company have been the means 
of adding several delightful gardens to modern 
literature, — such as " Elizabeth and her German 
Garden," Mrs. Earle's '• Old Time Gardens," etc. 
In now publishing " The Garden of a Commuter's 
"Wife " they give us another, less attractive in title 
but really a peer of the others. The scene is a 
New England garden of the old-fashioned sort, in 
the real country, not in a " tailor-made " suburb. 
There is a good deal about flowers, but there is 
even more of sparkling generalities and piquant 
personalities apropos of the human characters con- 
cerned in the garden-making. Each chapter has 
its date, but this is only a starting-point, and, like 
the text of a good sermon, may develope in mani- 
fold directions. The name of the author of this 
charming work is withheld, as is also the name of 
the artist of the eight beautiful photogravure illus- 
trations. 

Balzac's "The Chouans" in the " Luxembourg " 
edition (Crowell) will, if possible, be more enjoyable 
than ever. The novel furnishes many opportunities 
for the illustrations which form a prominent feature 
of this edition, and the introduction, by Professor 
William P. Trent of Columbia University, is all that 
can be desired. It tells us the date of the publication 
of this story, its place in the " Comedie Humaine," 
its purpose and chief characteristics. The photo- 
gravure frontispiece, as well as the twelve illustra- 
tions in half-tone, are by Julien Le Blant. 

" Mother and Baby " ( Russell) is a collection of 
twenty-six lullaby poems by Miss Mary D. Brine, 
with a full-page picture in illustration of each poem. 
The poems voice the maternal sentiment with much 
sweetness of melody and depth of feeling. The pic- 
tures are sometimes copies of paintings by famous 
artists, sometimes photographs from life ; but all are 
beautiful, and the volume as a whole will appeal 
strongly to the Mother-Heart of womankind. 

A capital book to while away dull moments — if 
any such there be — at a country club is " The Gol- 
fer's Rubdiydt " (Stone) by Mr. H. W. Boynton. It 
is a clever adaptation of the metre and philosophy of 
Omar Khayydm to the scenes and emotions of the 
golf links. There are seventy-nine stanzas, each 
illustrated with a pictorial border that fills the page, 
these being unsigned but full of ingenuity and 



variety. As a sample of the book's quality, here 
is the opening stanza : 

" Wake ! for the snn has driven in eqnal flight 
The stars before him from the Tee of Night, 
And holed them every one without a Miss, 
Swinging at ease his gold-shod Shaft of Light." 



Books for the Young. 

L 



It seems cause for congratulation that there are com- 
paratively few books designed particularly for children 
this year which deal with battle, murder, and sudden 
death. The English-speaking nations, giving an example 
and a warning to all the world in South Africa and the 
Philippines, have apparently grown weary of much 
fighting, and the national distaste for the course they 
have taken is apparent in the character of the volumes 
put out for the instruction and amusement of our chil- 
dren. This has led to an increase in the number of 
books of travel and adventure, as well as of those that 
stimulate the imagination — fairy stories, and the like. 
More volumes of the sort that has long had the esteem 
of the world, — works, that is, of real and approved 
merit, in some cases made over for little people, — are 
also to be noted. The prevailing fondness for sociological 
studies shows itself in this minor department of human 
activity also. Reflecting even better the spirit of the 
times are the various works telling of boys earning a 
living for themselves, or of the roads to commercial 
success. Historical subjects, giving the author an oppor- 
tunity to amuse and instruct at once, have lost none of 
their popularity in the books for children both large and 
small. If there is a growing desire for the rare quality 
called serenity in our literature, the great library now 
announced for the young fails to show it. And, generally 
speaking, there is a woeful lack of all literary quality 
here, the old rewritten stories exhibiting it far more than 
the new ones. Apart from these works, which shine by 
reflected light, there is hardly a title in the long list 
which bids strongly for renown beyond the passing year. 
Boys' books are still greatly in the majority, and those 
in which both boys and girls play a part are hardly 
fewer in number than those designed for girls alone. 
A noticeable feature of the children's books for the 
holiday season of 1901 may be foimd in the lack of 
eminent names of those concerned in their production. 
The great masters of English fiction did not think that 
writing tales to tell to their juniors was in any way be- 
neath their dignity a generation ago ; to-day there seems 
to be a great gulf fixed, and those who write of the 
juvenalia have little or no reputation in the broader paths 
of literature. The exceptions, by their rarity, prove the 
existence of the role. 

The best of the books of travel and ad- 
Bookjo/trarel venture is probably Mr. Noah Brooks's 
and adventure. t-.- . ■, /^ .■ - ., o^ 

" First across the Lontment, the Story 

of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1803-4-5 " 
(Scribner). Complete reliance is placed upon the diary 
of the explorers, and most of the narrative is set forth 
in the very language of Jefferson's two captains. Noth- 
ing but good can follow the perusal of this well-illns- 
trated volume, whatever the age of the reader. — Mr, 
Ilezekiah Butterworth has prepared the second volume 
of the " Traveller Tales " (Estes), dealing this year 
with China. Proper regard has been shown for the tra-

ditions of the great empire, and in contrast the Trans- 
Siberian railway and the new seaports of Russia and 
Britain are described. Travellers of note are quoted, 
and many interesting bits of folk-lore preserved. The 
book has numerous full-page pictures. — " The Bears 
of Bear River" (Doubleday) is a story of early pi- 
oneer days in Indiana, describing the life of children 
in the second quarter of the last century. Mr. Charles 
Major tells the exciting little stories, and, though he 
taxes the credulity of older readers and fairly throws 
himself upon their mercy in his diction, his book de- 
serves favorable mention Mr. Francis Hill, a new 

writer, brings some of the vigor and breeziness of the 
far West into "The Outlaws of Horseshoe Hole, a 
Story of the Montana Vigilantes" (Scribner). Law is 
here vindicated, vice punished, and virtue rewarded, in 
a manner ethically sound if a bit sensational A simi- 
lar environment answers for " Boys of the Fort " (Mer- 
shon), by Captain Ralph Bonehill (Mr. Edward Strate- 
meyer) . An army outpost is in this story besieged by 
Indians and renegade whites, and the boys take a promi- 
nent part in raising the siege Another of Captain 

Bonehill's volumes is called " Three Young Ranchmen " 
(Saalfield), telling of boys who found work not the 
most disagreeable thing in the world when success fol- 
lowed closely after. — Mr. Frederick A. Ober deals with 
the Southwest, where his small hero has accompanied 
his father in a search for health. There is an Indian 
boy for a chum, and much excitement of a healthy sort. 
The volume is called " Tommy Foster's Adventures " 
(Altemus), and is plentifully illustrated by Mr. Stanley 
M. Arthur. Mr. Ober is a great traveller, and really 
knows the Indians. — A new edition, with pictures, of 
Mr. Samuel Travers Clover's " Paul Travers's Adven- 
tures " (Lothrop) must revive interest in this true story 
of a boy who went around the world on his own re- 
sponsibility. — Four books by Mrs. Mary Hazelton Wade 
constitute the " Little Cousin " series (Page). They 
deal, respectively, with the home life of children in 
Russia, Borneo, Japan, and aboriginal America, and 
have numerous pictures by Miss L. J. Bridgman. All 
are wholesome, and of a sort to remove irrational preju- 
dice against people of another color and nationality 

from our own Mrs. Chaplin Ayrton has written, and 

Dr. William Elliot Griffis edited, « Child Life in Ja- 
pan, and Japanese Child Stories " (Heath), an inter- 
esting compilation with twenty-seven pictures, well- 
known to a former generation in its complete form 

Professor Frederick Starr's " Strange Peoples " and 
" American Indians " (Heath) deserve mention in this 
connection, though published somewhat earlier in the 
year. They are scientifically sound and wholly inter- 
esting. — Two boys who take an involuntary flight in a 
balloon and alight in an Inca city in the Peruvian 
mountains may be read about in " An Aerial Runaway, 
the Balloon Adventures of Rod and Todd in North and 
South America" (Lothrop). The authors are father 
and son, Messrs. William P. and Charles P. Chipman. 
The book is uncommonly exciting, the illustrations, by 
Mr. W. A. McCuUough, bearing out the text. — " The 
Rover Boys on the Great Lakes " (Mershon) is the fifth 
of a series by Mr. Arthur M. Winfield, in which kid- 
nappers play a leading part. There are adventures by 
the dozen, with the boys awake to every move in the 
game ; somewhat more awake, it must be confessed, 
than most of their elders. — A transcript from real life, 
illustrated by reproductions from actual photographs 
taken during the cruise, is " A Year in a Yawl " (Dou- 



bleday, Page & Co.), by Mr. Russell Doubleday. It 
describes the extended voyage of Captain Ransom and 
his companions from a port on Lake Michigan down 
the canal to the Illinois River, thence along the Miss- 
issippi to the Gulf of Mexico, around the point of 
Florida northward up the Atlantic coast, and thence,, 
by way of the St. Lawrence, the Welland Canal, and 
the great lakes, back to St. Joseph again. It is a good 
book, which loses nothing by confining itself to facts. — 
Thirty years ago, when whaling was whaling, Mr. 
Thomas West Hammond engaged in that ancient Amer- 
ican industry. His reminiscences, softened by the years 
and enlivened by imagination, are set forth in " Oa 
Board a Whaler " (Putnam). The excellent pictures 
are by Mr. Harry George Burgess, and the work as a 
whole is informing and interesting. — "The Cruise of 
the Mary Rose ; or. Here and There in the Pacific " 
(Bradley) covers an immense extent of land and water^ 
and deals incidentally with the state of the souls of the 
South Sea Islanders. The book is by Mr. William H. C. 
Kingston, and possesses minor historical value in addi- 
tion to its being a record of exploration and early mis- 
sion work. 

Chronologically speaking, Mr. Arthur S. 
IfhiZ^." Walpole's "Little Arthur's History of 

Greece" (Crowell) leads all the long 
train of books from which children may glean facts 
from the annals of the past. It is a book that makes 
its appeal to very young children, and is simply and 
prettily told, with many illustrations. — The most pitiful 
tale of all forms the basis of " Stephen, a Story of the 
Little Crusaders" (Crowell), by Miss Eva Madden. 
Stephen of Cloyes is the salient character of the book, 
and the final catastrophe is greatly softened, as it 

should be if children are to read it " The Story of the 

Cid for Young People " (Lee & Shepard) deals with a 
fascinating and noble personality in a manner that will 
meet with childish approval. The facts are selected 
from sufficiently authentic sources, but withont crushing 
out the legendary glamour of the case, by Mr. Calvin Dill 

Wilson The Spanish appear in quite another light in 

"Wind and Wave, the Siege of Ley den" (Bradley)^ 
which Mr. H. E. Burch opens with the massacre at 
Haarlem, a scene of horror which, with its fringe of 
heroism and misery, can never be forgotten. — Coming 
down to the evil days following the revocation of the 
Edict of Nantes, Mrs. Millicent E. Mann chooses for 
her heroine a little daughter of the royal shoemaker, 
who lends her name to the book " Margot " (McClurg). 
She takes refuge in the New York colony, like so many 
Huguenots, and has many exciting times during her 

days of small girlhood Going to the other side of the 

world, " A Boy of Old Japan " (Lee & Shepard) is an 
account of the mediaeval civilization of that pleasant 
country, and the life led by a boy in it. Numerous 
colored plates from photographs somewhat destroy the 
feeling of remoteness of time. — English history begins 
with " In the Days of William the Conqueror " (Lee & 
Shepard), a slight account of the life of the Norman 
chieftain, by Mrs. Eva March Tappan, with children 
introduced to give it interest. — " My Friend Anne, a 
Story of the Sixteenth Century " (Warne) is a romantic 
biography of Anne Boleyn, by Miss Jessie Armstrong. 
It deals with the child and young girl, and follows in 
point of time " HoUyberry and Mistletoe " (Little), by 
Mrs. Mary Caroline Hyde, which has to do with the 
reign of Henry VII. Both books have merit. — Coming 
now to America, the history of Mistress Anne Brad-

street is told by Miss Edith Robinson, in " A Little 
Puritan Pioneer " (Page), in a really engaging manner. 
— Miss Ruth Hall is much more ambitions with a con- 
temporaneous account of a young man who takes part in 
the fight at Wethersfield and eventually drifts back to 
England to serve James II., after taking a gallant part 
against the persecution of the Quakers in New England. 
Her volume is named "The Golden Arrow" (Hough- 
ton) In the period immediately anterior to the War 

of the Revolution, the most exciting event is told by 
Mr. James Otis in " When We Destroyed the Gaspee " 
(Estes). This high-handed declaration of rights by the 
colonists on Narragansett Bay is receiving the attention 
it deserves after many years of forgetfulness. The book 

is one of the " Stories of American History " series 

By the same author, and dealing with the same period, 
is "Our Uncle the Major" (Crowell), which is an ac- 
count of two small boys who arrived in New York at 
the time of the Stamp Riots and were rudely hustled by 
the mob when it learned that their uncle was in com- 
mand of the King's Fort overlooking the town. — The 
period between the two wars with the French and In- 
dians is utilized by Mr. G. Waldo Browne for •' The 
Hero of the Hills " (Page), in which Joseph Stark ap- 
pears as a stripling on the frontier in company with 
Robert Rogers. It is a story of adventure rather than 

of actual fighting " With Washington in the West " 

(Lee & Shepard) is by Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, the 
first of a promised " Colonial " series from that busy 
writer's pen. Braddock's defeat is used, for the fifth or 
sixth time in recent years, for the principal incident. — 
How hard life might be made for a little girl in Revo- 
lutionary days appears in Mrs. Adele £. Thompson's 
" Betty Sheldon, Patriot " (Lee & Shepard), where the 
small daughter of an officer in the Continental army is 
taken into the wilds of Pennsylvania by her Tory uncle. 
Yorktown ends the book, as it did the war. — The fine 
defence of Ft. Stephenson, and the battle of Lake Erie, 
appear in Mr. W. O. Stoddard's "Jack Morgan, a Boy 
of 1812 " (Lothrop), the youthful Jack having a share 
in both victories. He is with General Harrison also, 
taking the part of a scout. — To this period may be 
referred " A Frigate's Namesake " (Century Co.), by 
Mrs. Alice Balch Abbot, with pictures by Mr. George 
Yarian. The small child of the story is a contemporary 
of ours who has been christened Essex. As soon as 
she grows old enough she interests herself in the brave 
deeds of our navy, and has some adventures with naval 
officers and others which are most instructive. — Mr. 
Kirk Munroe deals with the navy too, at a somewhat 
later day, in " A Son of Satsuma ,' or. With Perry in 
Japan " (Scribner). In addition to the fine story of the 
o{>ening of the ancient empire to western influences, 
there is a stunning fight, that at Qualla Battoo. — Go- 
ing back to the early history of the Plymouth Colony, 
Mr. Munroe pays tribute to a fine Indian character in 
" The Belt of Seven Totems, a Tale of Massasoit " (Lip- 
pincott). If similar wisdom had been shown by the 
other colonists in dealing with their aboriginal neigh- 
bors, it would not have been necessary for Mrs. Jackson 
to write " A Century of Dishonor." Mr. Munroe has 
left out a great deal of fighting in these two books of 
his, but they are none the less entertaining. — Mor- 
gan's Men " (Little) has Nathanael Greene and Sumter 
among its characters, and is a thrilling story of the 
Southern campaign, with a lover and his beloved for 
good measure. It is by Mr. John Preston True, with 
illustrations by Mrs. Lilian Crawford True. — The Mex- 



ican War, splendid courage in a bad cause, supplies 
Captain Bonefaill with the facts for " With Taylor on 
the Rio Grande " (Estes). This is the second of a 
series, and deals with much of the fighting in Mexico, 

from Palo Alto to Buena Vista Mr. Byron A. Dunn 

adds another volume to the " Young Kentuckians " se- 
ries with «« From Atlanta to the Sea " (McClurg), in 
which the young men of his former books make their 
appearance once more in this. The story has many 
merits, historical accuracy not the least of thepi. — 
" The Story of Manhattan " (Scribner), by Mr. Cfixrles 
Hemstreet, is to be included here. It is filled with 
historical references to places formerly noteworthy but 
now submerged in the rank growth of the metropolis, 
the numerous illustrations being taken from old books 
and prints. Anything that will teach American cities 
that they have traditions deserves welcome, and this 
book is one of the best of its kind. — Of much the same 
sort is Miss Amanda M. Douglas's << A Little Girl in 
Old New Orleans " (Dodd), one of a series of which ser- 
eral volumes have already appeared. It differs from 
Mr. Hemstreet's book in conveying its instruction under 
the guise of pleasant fiction, but is none the less com- 
mendable. — Mr. George Alfred Henty, the unwearied, 
has three more of his portly volumes published this sea- 
son, all in the manner to which a generation of boys has 
been accustomed, with a youthful hero or two moving 
through a narrative made up of- historical facts for the 
most part. " At the Point of the Bayonet, a Tale of 
the Mahratta War " has pictures by Mr. Wal Paget, and 
is concerned with the series of episodes which led to the 
overthrow of the most warlike force met during the 
British occupation of India ; " To Herat and Cabul, a 
Story of the First Afghan War," with illustrations by 
Mr. Charles M. Sheldon, deals with the awful calamity 
that overtook the British army on its retreat from 
Afghanistan in January, 1842, redeemed in part by the 
defence of Jellalabad ; " With Roberts to Pretoria, 
a Tale of the South African War," illustrated by Mr. 
William Rainey, R.I., takes up the narrative where it 
was left in " With Buller in Natal " last year, and brings 
it down to the second stag^ of the conflict. All these 
are published by Charles Scribner's Sons. — "Under 
the Allied Flag^, a Boy's Adventures in China during 
the Boxer Revolt" (Lothrop) is another volume in Mr. 
E. S. Brooks's " Young Defender "series, with the same 
hero to whom we were introduced in " With Lawton and 
Roberts." The book takes its readers into every place 
of danger during the advance of the allied armies, in 
the beleaguered legations at Peking as well as with the 
advancing column. War turns its bright side out in 
stories like this. 

Heroe* Among the peaceful books intended more 

wuiherxyine* particularly for boys, "Citizen Dan of 
of peace. jhe Junior Republic " (Bradley), by Miss 

Ida T. Thurston, is one of the best. The interesting 
experiment in self-government which is actually g^ing 
on in many places in the United States here serves as 
a frame for the biography of a wilful, lazy, half-grown 
lad, the son of wealthy parents. Under the influence 
of a little world of boys and girls, in which the passions 
and blunders of life are reproduced with much fidelity, 
the hero rises to a knowledge of himself and the sig- 
nificance of his actions. His promotion at the close is 
unnecessarily abrupt, but the story deserves study by 
educators everywhere. — " Our Jim " (Estes) is an ac- 
count of the manner in which one wholesome boy made

wilfulness, chiefly by setting a good example — " Lem, 
a New England Village Boy " (Scribner) is a story of 
healthy and simple boyhood, told by Mr. Noah Brooks 
in a manner that is certain to suggest autobiography. 
It will bring Mr. Aldrich's " Story of a Bad Boy " to 
mind more than once, though Lem was the better be- 
haved of the two. — " A Young Inventor's Pluck " 
(Saalfield) is not so much concerned with invention as 
with a gang of unredeemable villains who persecute 
the inventor and his sister. Mr. Arthur M. Winfield 
has here written a sensational tale, full of excursions 
and alarums Quite at the other extreme is the sec- 
ond of the " Randy Books," by Miss Amy Brooks, 
called "Randy's Summer" (Lee & Shepard). It is 
placid and serene, with much innocent fun of a mild 
sort. — " Out of Bounds " (Lippincott) is another of Mr. 
Andrew Home's books, a good sized volume of short 
stories of schoolboy life in England. Poachers and 
'squires figure in the scrapes into which the youngsters 
fall, and the whole atmosphere is foreign to the Ameri- 
can schoolboy, but manly and hearty for all that. Mr. 
Harold Copping provides the illustrations. — A smart 
village lad starts with nothing and brings himself to a 
great deal in "How Dexter Paid his Way" (Crowell), 
by Mrs. Kate Upson Clark. The story is wholesome 
and stimulating, with luck as well as good qualities on 
the hero's side. — " The Little Cave Dwellers " (Crow- 
ell), by Mrs. Ella Farman Pratt, tells of a little boy 
most unjustly accused of crime by some older boys who 
should have known better, together with some experi- 
ments in aboriginal life both novel and ingenious. — 
" Little Sky-High below Stairs " (Crowell) has to do 
with the small son of a Chinese family of rank, who 
lives in a Christian household for a year, and tells what 
happens when his host and employer goes to China 
with him. It is an interesting and unusual tale, by Mr. 
Hezekiah Butterworth. — One of the best things in any 
of the season's books is the letter which the lad who is 
described in "A Twentieth Century Boy" (Lee & 
Shepard) sends home to his mother. The conclusion 
of this story, by Miss Marguerite Linton Glentworth, 

is not nearly so credible as this single missive 

" Galopoff, the Talking Pony " (Altemus) carries out 
an original idea of Mr. Tudor Jenks's, in which a little 
horse tells some American boys who own him of his 
life abroad, and at the end rescues his little Russian 
master of earlier days from shipwreck. — A sentimental 
story, in which a small boy shows how much can be 
done to help the world by youngsters, is Mrs, Sophie 
C. Taylor's "The Story of a Little Poet" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). Among other precocities is the lisping 
in numbers, many of which are given. They show 
much talent in versification, and are quite as good as 
many of the drawing-room songs of the day. — Miss 
Josephine Dodge Daskam recites a series of episodes 
in the life of a normal, healthy, mischievous little fel- 
low, calling the volume containing them " The Imp and 
the Angel" (Scribner). The illustrations are by Mr. 
Bernard J. Rosenmeyer, rounding out a most desirable 
book for half-grown folk. — A real and enduring friend- 
ship between the son of a mechanic and the heir to 
great wealth used not to be remarkable enough to make 
a book of, in America at least, but it may be welcomed 
in "My Friend Jim, a Story of Real Boys and for 
Them " (Lee & Shepard). The story is honest and 
manly. — Mr. Thomas Cobb has taken time from more 
ambitious fiction, to write one of the pretty little vol- 
umes in " The Dumpy Books for Children " (Dutton), 



calling it " The Little Clown." It is a sterling book, 
in which the small sorrows of childhood appear, as they 
should, as a source of great misery to those on whom 
they fall, and is sensible, humorous, and true, into the 

bargain In the "Cosy Corner Series" (Page) is a 

story of " A Bad Penny," in which a sailor lad who is 
endeavoring to make restitution of some plate stolen 
by an uncle long before is himself accused of theft, 
and succeeds in clearing his name after long probation. 
The story is one of the early republic, and has the battle 

between the " Chesapeake " and " Shannon " in it 

Of nearly the same date is " In the Poverty Year " 
(Crowell), by Miss Marian Douglas, a pathetic trans- 
cript from the annals of New England in the year 
1816.— In "Little Dick's Son" (Crowell) a small 
boy's imaginary companion is gradually developed into 
a conscience by Mrs. Kate Gannett Wells. It is a 
spiritual little tale of more than ordinary merit. — The 
adoption of a twin by the little chap in " Boy Donald 
and his Chum " (Lee & Shepard) makes fun for the 
small readers of Penn Shirley's latest book, the sequel 
to the " Boy Donald " story of last year. 
Storiei of ^ most useful book, in a day when the 

iuccestin cities are overcrowded with ambitious 

various fields. country boys and girls, is Mr, James 
Otis's "Larry Hudson's Ambition" (Page). It tells of 
two country boys who are being worked by a severe 
taskmaster, a farmer, and of the acquaintance they make 
during a journey to New York City. The street boy 
they find saves the farmer from being swindled, and is 
taken out to the farm at his own request. He finds the 
life there, for all its hard work, so much better than 
his street life in the metropolis that he is happy all day 
long. The book makes one long for the good time when 
everyone vnll have both city and country life, each 
relieving the disadvantages and teaching the virtues of 

the other Anecdotes of those who have made various 

sorts of success in the world are embodied in the volume, 
" How They Succeeded : Life Stories of Successful Men 
Told by Themselves" (Lothrop). Dr. Orison Swett 
Marden has interviewed a number of men and women 
who are in the public eye, millionaires, inventors, authors, 
musicians, educators, and others, and has in this way 
enabled his subjects to tell their own histories. It deals 
with the various elements that go to make up success 
in the modern world, though it is silent on one of the 
most important of them all, sometimes called luck. — 
<• Pine Ridge Plantation, the Trials and Successes of a 
Young Cotton Planter " (Crowell) is by Mr. William 
Drysdale, recounting the experience of a smart farmer's 
boy who has wit enough to go to the South and start 
for himself, with his sister to give him encouragement. 
There is both humor and good sense here. — A party of 
young fellows take a contract to supply a Southern 
railway with ties. How this is done, amid many dis- 
couragements and adventures in a wild country, is told 
by Mr. George Cary Eggleston in " Camp Venture, a 
Story of the Virginia Mountains " (Lothrop). Business 
difficulties are not the only ones surmounted, and the 
story is one of real life. — " Two Boys in the Blue 
Ridge " (Estes) is, for all its title, chiefly concerned 
with the way two young men get along in a New York 
real estate office, and is a business story of interest to 
those just entering upon commercial life. Numerous 
illustrations are done by the author, Mr. W. Gordon 
Parker. — It occurs to a boy in San Francisco that there 
may be precious metal in the ruins of some old reducing 
works not far from his home, and he leases the land

from its oocnpant. His guess was quickly verified, and 
the pleasantly told subsequent history is embodied in 
" The Golden Chimney, a Boy's Mine " (Robertson), 
by Miss Elizabeth Gerberding. — Mr. Arthur M. Win- 
field has taken the material used by the late Horatio 
Alger for a boys' drama, and worked it over into " Nelson 
the Newsboy" (Mershon). It is the familiar story of 
a little castaway in city streets, who makes something 
of himself iu spite of the greatest temptations, coming 
into his own at last. — Mrs. Helen Dawes Brown has 
grasped the important factor, so little considered in the 
modern business world, of loving kindness and human 
sympathy between employer and employed. The small 
heroine of " Her Sixteenth Year" (Houghton) is only 
too anxious to be of some assistance to her father, a 
manufacturer. To this end she enters his shop at a 
moment when a strike seems imminent, and by being 
her simple self brings about an understanding which 
precludes trouble. It is a good example for others to 
follow. — How a little Irish girl in a small town won 
her way to the esteem of her neighbors is told by Mrs. 
Gulielma Zollinger in "Maggie McLanehan" (McClurg). 
Blessed with common-sense and a yearning toward in- 
dustry, Maggie begins with a single friend and ends with 
a real place in the community. But she was more for- 
tunate than most, subjectively and objectively. 

Among the books intended for little girls 
i^f^L. " 'Ti'da Jane " (Page), by Miss Marshall 

Saunders, is an unusually moving and 
interesting tale of a little inmate of one of those orphan 
asylums which serve as a field for amateur philanthro- 
pists to disport themselves in. It is an intelligent re- 
volt against that modern evil known as institutionalism, 
and is provided with suitable illustrations bv Mr. 
Clifford Carleton. — " Daddy's Girl " (Lippincott) tells 
how the thought of a small child keeps a man from 
profiting by the dishonesty into which his wife's ambi- 
tion had led him. It is by Mrs. L. T. Meade, with 
pictures by Mr. Gordon Browne; and it reveals a ten- 
dency, common in books of this class, toward showing 

a high mortality rate among good children Mr. 

Albert Bigelow Paine's " The Little Lady, Her Book " 
(Altemus) is a bright and cheerful collection of small 
adventures, inspiriting in the outlook upon life. Several 
artists have had a hand in its interpretive drawings. — 
" The Lonesomest Doll " (Houghton), written by Mrs. 
Abbie Farwell Brown, is a story of the entree upon the 
highest mundane life of a neglected soul among dolls. 
It is interesting and well written. — Postage stamps, a 
bicycle, and several other desirable articles, are the 
things referred to in "What Came to Winifred" 
(Estes), by Miss Elizabeth Westyn Timlow. The 
heroine is a wholesome little body, sane and sweet. — 
The lost luxury of hospitality in one of the Gulf States 
before the war finds sympathetic portrayal by Mrs. M. 
E. M. Davis in «• Jaconetta, Her Loves" (Houghton). 
It will be found interesting by grown people as well as 

children A friend of several years standing appears 

again in Miss Grace Le Baron's " Jessica's Triumph " 
(Lee & Shepard). There is a moral in the story, and 
a bringing to grace of a rich young girl, indicating a 
field for missionary work sometimes neglected. — It is 
a wealthy little miss who is one of the heroines in " A 
Pair of Them " (Crowell), the other being a hunchback 
from the poorest part of the national capital. The 
poor child confers beauty of soul upon her companion, 
and has a small dog to help her. The book is by Miss 
Evelyn Raymond — The favorite Cinderella theme is 



the foundation of " Only DoUie " (Lee & Shepard), by 
Miss Nina Rhoades, with pictures by Miss Bertha G. 
Davidson. A little drudge comes into her own, to the 

delight of all readers "Peggy's Trial " (Page) is a 

stepmother, and Mrs. Mary Knight Potter, the author 
of the little book, shows how great a calamity a small 

thing may be among small people Reforming a 

<' regular army man " is not an easy task, but Miss £. 
Livingston Prescott's little girl in " A Small, Small 
Child " (Page) accomplishes the feat. It is a pathetic 

little incident The utter forgetfulness which well 

disposed persons sometimes bestow upon their own 
childhood makes the negative misery of " Gatty and I " 
(Page) a book worth taking to heart by those who are 
in contact with children not their own. — A rude ex- 
terior covering a warm heart will be found depicted in 
"Marcia and the Major" (Crowell), a story of the 

Rocky Mountains by Mr. J. L. Harbour Bears, large 

black bears, enter the scene in Mrs. Harriet Prescott 
Spofford's " The Children of the Valley " (Crowell), 
disturbing, not unpleasantly, the serenity of a pleasant 

summer story " The Flat-iron and the Red Cloak " 

(Crowell) is a pretty little tale by Mrs. Abby Morton 
Diaz, imaginative in conception, though dealing with 

homely things A long series of misadventures lends 

humor to the title of " The Would-B^-Goods " (Har- 
per), by £. Nesbit, who is really Mrs. Hubert Bland. 
It is an English story, filled with innocent adventure 
and mischief. Mr. Reginald B. Birch makes the pic- 
tures " Four on a Farm, Summer at Hill Top " 

(Little, Brown, & Co.) is rather a book for girls than 
boys, though the happy four are equally divided be- 
tween the sexes. As in all Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith's 
writings, there is here a wholesome spirit, quite free 
from mawkishness. 

"The Captain of the School" (Little, 
^d^lVe- Brown, & Co.), in spite of its title, is 

rather more concerned with girls than 
with boys. A large family of children bring them- 
selves up, for the most part, and have many troubles 
and as many compensations in the process. — " High 
School Days at Harbortown " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
by Mrs. Lily F. Wesselhoeft, has certain resemblances 
to the preceding story, but is centred more on school 
affairs and less on those of a private family. It is a 
worthy book, well illustrated by Mr. H. C. Ireland. — 
In" A Nest of Girls, Boarding-School Days" (Dutton), 
Miss Elizabeth Westyn Timlow writes from the ful- 
ness of her experience, and lets her readers into the 
secrets of a young teacher in a girls' seminary of 
learning. — The ideal school in Miss Gabriella E. Jack- 
son's " Caps and Capers, a Story of Boarding School 
Life" (Altemus) is almost identical with Miss Tim- 
low's, an agreement among educators rare enough to 
be noted. In the latter book, however, a school con- 
ducted on the wrong principles is set in abrupt con- 
trast, making the story more informing but no more 
interesting.—" The Prize Watch " (Saalfield), by Mrs. 
Emily Guillon Fuller, is the tale a mother tells to her 
children of her own school days, with a generous and 

unexpected climax Miss Helen Leah Reed in " Bren- 

da's Summer at Rockley " (Little, Brown, & Co.), has 
written a sequel to a former story of school life, in 
which Brenda passes a pleasant summer at the sea- 
shore. It is a wholesome book, telling of a merry and 
healthy vacation — Miss Evelyn Sharp, discoverer and 
inventor of " Wymps," calls her latest book " The

of interests are boand up in the small heroine, who 
comes to grief through a blunder by one of her teach- 
ers while she is swinging at the gymnastic exercises of 
the school. 

Three stories about cats attest the grow- 
ing popularity of a much misunderstood 
household companion. " Madame An- 
gora " (Estes), by Miss Harriet A. Cheever, is the sort 
of story that cats in fiction have accustomed us to, with 
children always in the foreground. — In " A Jolly Cat 
Tale " (Lee & Shepard), Miss Amy Brooks tells with 
pen and pencil of an ambitious feline family who learn 
(what we human folk do not know) that the garments 
of convention are cumbersome and uncouth. — " The 
Candle and the Cat" (Crowell) has a little girl 
who sends her light into a naughty world, and a cat 
named Trolley to help her in good deeds. Miss Mary F. 

Leonard is the author, and the book is well illustrated 

Cats, being the natural companions of witches, and sub- 
ject to a deal of superstitious mistreatment on that ac- 
count, may well be associated with the numerous fairy 
books of the year. There are still unused colors in the 
spectrum, and Mr. Andrew Lang's " The Violet Fairy 
Book " (Longmans), with its handsome illustrations in 
color by Mr. H. J. Ford, has the merits of its prede- 
cessors, with some of its own added. Doubtless the 
stories suitable for inclusion in these volumes are innu- 
merable, but the later books show the tendency to go 
farther and farther afield. Many of those in this book 
are from African and Roumanian sources, and of much 
interest and worth. — Altogether African are the Rev. 
George W. Bateman's "Zanzibar Tales " (McClurg), 
translated from the Swahili of the eastern coast during 
an extended residence as a missionary. They bear a de- 
lightful vein of humor, akin to that in " Uncle Remus," 
and a morality which does not show a crying need of 
missionary effort. — Another volume in " The True An- 
nals of Fairyland " is concerned with " Old King Cole " 
(Dent-Macmillan). Familiar stories have been edited 
by Mr. J. M. Gibbon and illustrated by Mr. Charles 
Robinson into new attractiveness. The book is really 
beautiful. — Lacking color, but with pictures by Miss 
Helen Maitland Armstrong which lose nothing by 
comparison, a volume of " Swedish Fairy Tales " 
(McClurg) is a valuable addition to the child's library. 
The stories, written in Swedish by Miss Anna Wahlen- 
burg, and translated idiomatically into English by her 
brother, Mr. Axel Wahlenburg, combine sweetness and 

vigor " Fairy Tales from Afar " (Wessels) contains 

translations by Miss Jane MuUey from the Danish of 
Mr. Svend Grundtvig, with numerous pictures by Mr. 
Sydney F. Aldridge. The tales show a common origin 
with those of Miss Wahlenburg's, and are also meri- 
torious A little book but a nice one contains Mr. A. 

Comyns Carr's "The Fairy of the Rhone" (Page). 
This is a variant of an old theme, but perennially fresh 

and wholesome "Royal Rogues" (Putnam) is an 

original story by Miss Alberta Bancroft, dealing with 
two sons of the redoubtable King Goldemar, and all 
sorts of accessories, kobolds and the like. The draw- 
ings for the book, by Mr. Louis Betts, are unusually 
good, and the volume is attractive. — Abundant humor 
characterizes Mr. Frank M. Bicknell's "The Double 
Prince " (Estes), in which one fat scion of fairy royalty 
becomes two thin scions, to the great delight of all con- 
cerned. — A fairy gift makes all sorts of fun for a little 
boy in « The Magic Key " (Little, Brown, & Co.), Miss 
Elizabeth S. Tucker reaching the acme of desire in her 



story by conferring invisibility upon a boy in school 

" Prince Harold " (Page), with drawings by Miss Aline 
Witry for Miss L. F. Brown's letter-press, is concerned 
with a monkey among other things, and is very funny. — 
" Lucy in Fairyland " (Lee & Shepard) is Miss Sophie 
May's account of a little girl who visits the woman in 
the moon, the man of lunar fable having been super- 
seded in these days of petticoat supremacy. — Mr. 
William Rose tells "The Tin Owl Stories" (Estes), 
with Miss L. J. Bridgman's drawings to help him. The 
short tales of which the book is made up are quaintly 
interesting. 

There are songs and verses galore, some

a sumptuous book has been made of "Old 

Songs for Young America" (Doubleday). "Yankee 
Doodle " and " London Bridge " indicate the variety of 
the selection. All have been harmonized from the old 
airs, by Mr. Clarence Forsythe; and Miss Blanche 
Ostertag has made a number of beautiful drawings of 
children for every page, color and black-and-white 
alternating. — Music accompanies "The Owl and the 
Woodchuck, with a Few Others" (Rand, McNally & 
Co.), by Mr. William Harold Neidlinger, with illustra- 
tions in color by Mr. Walter Bobbett. Fanciful jingles 
make a series of " song stories " of interest. — Miss 
Carolyn Wells has another of the books to which lovers 
of wit are growing accustomed, "The Merry-Go-Round" 
(Russell), with a number of cheerfulpicturesbyMr. Peter 
Newell. One of the limericks, passing into a household 
word, may be given : " A canner exceedingly canny, One 
morning remarked to his granny: 'A canner can can 
Anything that he can; But a canner can't can a can, can 
he ? ' " — A new edition of Miss Agnes Lee's attractive 
"The Round Rabbit, and Other Child Verse" (Small, 
Maynard & Co.) has been published, with good pictures 

and pretty end-papers Miss Zitella Cocke writes 

" The Grasshopper's Hop " (Estes), a book of pleasant 
rhymes for young folk, for which Mr. J. J. Mora makes 
suitable illustrations. — " Jingleman Jack" (Saalfield) 
has for sub-title " His Pictures and Rhymes of the 
Callings, the Crafts, and the Trades of the Times." 
Mr. Harry Kennedy accompanies each trade, and the 
verses describing it by Mr. James O'Dea, with handsome 
pictures in color. — "Jingles from Japan" (Robertson) 
is a book printed and decorated in the Japanese man- 
ner, the verses by Miss Mabel Hyde and the pictures 
by Miss Helen Hyde. It is quaint and good to look 
at. — There is nothing better of its kind than "Dens- 
low's Mother Goose" (McClure, Phillips & Co ), for 
which Mr. William Wallace Denslow has provided the 
colored pictures in a manner that leaves little to be 
desired. A change or two has been made from the 
accepted version of the rhymes, but it is too palpable 
to set the reader wrong. — " The True Mother Goose " 
(Wessels) keeps strictly to the text, which Miss 
Blanche McManus has drawn all sorts of pleasant de- 
signs for. — " The Pirate Frog and Other Tales " (Rand, 
McNally & Co.) is made up of clever verses by W. A. 
Frisbie, with many pictures, not so clever, by Mr. 

Frederick R. Bartholomew Miss Bertha Upton has 

done the verses and Miss Florence K. Upton the pic- 
tures for another " Golliwog " book, the " Auto-Go- 
Cart " (Longmans). The work of these two sisters is 
too well known to need comment. — A useful and merry 
book is the "Frolics of the ABC" (Laird & Lee), 
the rhymes by Mrs. Fannie E. Ostrander and the pic- 
tures by Mr. R. W. Hichert. Each letter is made into

a sprite, and these sprites are kept busy throaghoot the 
story.—" Where Was the Little White Dog " (Estes) 
is done by Miss Margaret Johnson in her well-known 
manner, a picture of the thing being used instead of 
the word standing for it, whenever possible in the 
text. — Stories, pictores, rhymes, and all sorts of things 
to interest a child, appear, as nsoal, in this year's 
"Chatterbox" (Estes) perhaps the most popular book 
of them all. — Of the same sort, bnt with a leaning 
toward early piety which is implied in the name, is 
"Sunday Reading for the Young" (E. & J. B. Young 
& Co.). — Miss Alcott's "Little Men" and "Little 
Women" have both been dramatized into forty-five- 
minute plays, suitable for school children, by Miss 
Elizabeth Lincoln Gould, with numerous pictures by 
Mr. Reginald B. Birch. Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 
are the publishers. 

Old stories have been reprinted in quan- 
2^T|^ tity, and Emerson's statement to the 

effect that every time a new book is 
published one should read an old one might hold good 
with these. Mr. Peter Xewell's wash drawings for 
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (Harper) leave 
nothing to be desired, and as interpretations of the de- 
lightful humor of the text may safely challenge com- 
parison with Sir John Tenniel's excellent pictures. This 

is indeed a book worth having Mr. John J. Mora has 

done the drawings for a new edition of the perennially 
attractive "Reynard the Fox" (Estes), in the manner 

of his " ^sop's Fables " last year Miss Eva March 

Tappan has done a rather curious and daring thing in 
her " Old Ballads in Prose " (Houghton), taking a 
number of the time-honored tales in inimitable rhyme, 
the Robin Hood cycle among others, and turning them 
into prose narrative with Miss Fanny Y. Cory's pictures 
to help her. Such work could not well be less than 
interesting, bnt an argument may arise over its being 
done at all. — Blanche McManus (Mrs. M. F. Mansfield) 
makes the illustrations for a number of good old tales, 
" Undine," " Rip Van Winkle," " The Dragon of Want- 
ley," and others, published with the title, " Told in the 
Twilight" (Wessels). — "The Boy's Odyssey" (Mac- 
millan), with the adaptation by Mr. Walter Copland 
Perry and the pictures by Mr. Jacomb Hood, is excel- 
lently done throughout. — Somewhat similar work, 
more inclusive but not so thorough within its limits, are 
the two books by Mr. Alfred J. Church, " Stories from 
Homer " and " Stories from Virgil " (Crowell) . Both 
volumes have their value enhanced by suitable illus- 
trations. — In the same series as the two books just 
mentioned are issued " Don Quixote " as retold by 
Mr. Calvin Dill Wilson, " Gulliver's Travels," Edmondo 
de Amicis's "Heart, a Schoolboy's Journal," and 
Jean Ingelow's " Mopsa the Fairy," with a colored 
frontispiece in each case and numbers of half-tone 
pictures. They are handy books, and not expensive. — 
Mrs. Edgar Lucas has made a new translation of the 
"Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm" (Lippincott), 
with a cover design, illustrated frontispiece, and numer- 
ous pictures besides, by Mr. Arthur Rackbam. — On 
the heels of this comes another new translation of 
"Grimm's Fairy Tales" (Dntton), by Miss Marion 
Edwards, with many pictures by Mr. R. Anning Bell. 
There are some tales not ordinarily included in this 
edition ; otherwise there is little choice between the 
two. — Louisa M. Alcott's " Little Men " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) has been provided with new illustrations by 
Mr. Reginald B. Birch, making a sterling book. —

There is a new edition of Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge's 
" Hans Brinker ; or. The Silver Skates " (Scribner), a 
book to be numbered among children's classics. — 
" Findelkind " (Page), by Ouida (Mile, de la Ram^), 
and " Madam Liberality," by Juliana Horatia Ewing, 
are re-published in compact little volumes by L. C. 
Page & Co. — Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have founded 
a " Home Library of the World's Best Literature for 
Children," with numerous volumes, among which may 
be named Thackeray's " The Rose and the Ring," edited 
by the Rev. Edward Everett Hale; Irving's "Dolph 
Heyliger," edited by Mr. C. H. Browne; Miss Martin- 
eau's " The Crofton Boys," edited by the Rev. William 
Elliot Griffis; Mme. de S^gur's "The Story of a Don- 
key," translated by Mr. Charles Welsh ; Jean Ingelow's 
" Three Fairy Stories," edited by Mr. C. F. Dole ; and 
many more. 

Several romances for youth introdaee 
love as an element, and so make an ap- 
peal rather to growing girls than boys. 
" Chevrons, a Story of West Point " (Lippincott) is 
one of these, written by " B. H. L.," and fully illus- 
trated. An accurate picture of life in the national 
Military Academy is g^ven, and there is incident and 
sentiment both. — " A Very Naughty Girl " (Lippin- 
cott), by Mrs. L. T. Meade, is the account of an heiress 
who enters the English home which is to be hers some 
day, and does not make herself any more disagreeable 
than the daughter of the 'squire in occupancy. — " Miss 
Bouverie " (whose name, we believe, is pronounced as 
if spelled " boobry ") sets forth the manner in which a 
divided family fortune is reunited in the third genera- 
tion by descendants of opposite sexes. It is written by 
Mrs. Molesworth and published by Lippincott. — Miss 
L. E. Tiddeman tells of a victory over self in " Celia's 
Conquest" (Lippincott), and affords a contrast between 
French and English life at the same time. The view 
of French domesticity, it may be noted, is somewhat 
broader than in the ordinary British novel. — " Teddy, 
Her Daughter" (Little, Brown, & Co.) b a sequel, 
after three years, to the popular " Teddy, Her Book." 
Like the other, it is a charming little character study, 
showing a profound knowledge of girl natnre. — Miss 
Laura E. Richards writes and Miss Etheldred B. Barry 
illustrates " Fernley House " (Estes), a story of West- 
ern cousins in an Eastern summer-house, with a fire 
and a gallant rescue by a girl for excitement. — The 
author of " Miss Toosey's Mission " describes the mourn- 
fully disappointing career of a trained nurse in " Las- 
sie " (Little, Brown, & Co.). Forced by sentiment to 
remain with her father in his village home in England 
after her mother's death, all her ambitions are brought 
to nothing, and the end is tragic. — Miss Carolyn Wells 
ingeniously contrives her " Patty Fairfield " (Dodd), so 
that she describes (and caricatures a little) four homes 
in as many different parts of the country, the stndions 
Boston household being perhaps the most assailable of 
them all. The book is one to chuckle over.

Mary E. O. Brush, tells of a small stray girl who unites 
a long-estranged father with his son during the joyous

Louise E. Baker sets it down, is to bring a haughty 
little rich girl to a knowledge of better things, Rosey 
Posey being her little colored maid. — " Tommy Tuck-

fisherman on the New England coast and eventually 
cures him of the drink habit in one of its most violent 

forms. Mr. J. C. Cowdrick is the author Another 

family which sets a good example in the matter of total 
abstinence lives over a grog-shop in " The Upstairs

Twins " are named Hannah Matilda and Elizabeth Ella,

Felicia Buttz Clark's " Beppino " is a little Italian 
fiddler living in the heathen blindness of Roman Catho- 
licism and rescued thence by some high-minded Amer- 
ican travellers in Italy. All the preceding books in 
this paragraph constitute the " Inglenook Tales," are 
illustrated, and published by Messrs. Jennings & Pye. — 
Of the same sort in intention, if not in form, are Mrs. 
Maud Ballington Booth's " Lights of Childhood " (Put- 
nam). Firelight, gaslight, moonlight, lovelight, and 
homelight are appropriately discussed, with no little 
sentiment and feeling. 



Notes. 



To Mr. John Lane's series of " Handbooks of Practi- 
cal Gardening " has been added " The Book of Old- 
Fashioned Flowers," by Mr. Harry Roberts. 

Mr. John Lane is the publisher of a pretty edition 
of " Casa Guidi Windows," with an introduction, dated 
ten years ago, by Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, now 
Madame Duclaux. 

<« The Conquest of the Old Northwest and Its Settle- 
ment by Americans " is an excellent reading book for 
young people. Mr. James Baldwin is the author, and 
the publishers are the American Book Co. 

The " Asgard Stories " of Miss Mary H. Foster and 
Miss Mabel H. Cummings, are told in simple language 
for children, and include the most important myths of 
Norse antiquity. Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. are 
the publishers. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. are starting a series 
of " French Novels of the Nineteenth Century," and 
Flaubert's " Salammbo " appears as the first volume. 
Mr. J. W. Matthews is the translator, and Mr. Arthur 
Symons supplies an introduction. 

Mr. H. W. Wilson, of Minneapolis, publishes a 
" Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature," which ap- 
pears monthly, and indexes the contents of sixteen 
periodicals. The method is cumulative, like that em- 
ployed in the Cleveland " Index." 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish an atlas of " Outline 
Maps for an Historical Atlas of the United States," 
prepared by Professor F. H. Hodder. These maps are 
to be colored by the student to represent the progressive 



territorial development of the nation, and provide a 
series of nineteen exercises, for which careful directions 
are given. Teachers will find this a useful auxiliary 
for their work in United States history. 

M. Marcel Provost's latest novel, " Fr^d^rique," 
translated from the French by Miss Ellen Marriage, 
the well-known Balzac translator, will shortly make its 
American appearance in an authorized edition from the 
press of Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

Mr. Henry C. Lahee has written a little book on 
«' Grand Opera in America " for the " Music Lovers' 
Series," published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. It is 
an interesting compendium of facts, making no pre- 
tensions to literary form, illustrated with portraits. 

The " Lovers' Library " of Mr. John Lane, embodies 
an excellent idea, but the publisher does not seem to 
have made the most of it. Three new volumes have 
just been added to the series, and contain, respectively, 
selections from the " love poems " of Burns, Landor, 
and Mrs. Browning. 

A book which certainly belongs in the class of 
Lamb's biblia abiblia is " The Physician's Visiting List," 
now in the fifty-first year of publication, which comes 
from Messrs. P. Blakiston's Son & Co. It is neatly 
gotten up, and contains various useful tables, besides 
the blank pages for daily memoranda. 

Gabriel Tellez, better known by his pseudonym of 
" El Maestro Tirso de Molina," is introduced to Amer- 
ican students of the Spanish language by an annotated 
text of his famous comedy, " Don Gil de las Calzas 
Verdes." Dr. Benjamin Parsons Bourland is the editor, 
and the volume is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. announce for early 
publication a life of Herbert Spencer, by Dr. David 
Starr Jordan, President of Stanford University. It 
will be complete to date, and comprehensive in every 
particular. The lack of any reliable biography of 
Spencer will undoubtedly insure a favorable reception 
for a volume by so eminent an authority. 

The " Oxford India Paper Dickens," published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde, is to fill seventeen volumes. The 
first of the seventeen is before us and contains " A Tale 
of Two Cities " and " A Child's History of England," 
which seems a most unfortunate bracketing. There are 
over eight hundred pages in this volume, which is never- 
theless easily pocketable. The original illustrations of 
Cruikshank, " Phiz," and others are used. 

An important addition to the source material for 
historical study is provided by the " Select Documents 
of English Constitutional History " which has recently 
been edited by Professors George Burton Adams and 
H. Morse Stephens, and published by the Macmillan Co. 
The whole period from the Conquest to the present 
time is covered by this compilation, and by means of 
judicious abridgment a very large aggregate amount of 
material is provided. The French and Latin documents 
are given in translation. 

Mr. J. M. Dent seems determined to republish the 
whole of English literature in the neat and artistic little 
volumes with which readers have of late years become so 
familiar. Thackeray and the Bible are his latest enter- 
prises, '•Vanity Fair," in three volumes, and «»Genesis," 
in one, being now at hand. The Bible is in the favorite 
" Temple " form, and will make twenty-four volumes. 
There will also be an introductory volume by the Bishop 
of Ripon, and the book of " Ecclesiasticus " as an experi-

ment, — to see whether the public wants the Apocrypha 
as well as the Canonical texts. Each book has a special 
editor, the name of Professor Sayce, for example, ap- 
pearing on the title-page of the " Genesis." The Messrs. 
Lippincott are the American publishers of this most 
charming of Bibles, for which we predict a very large 
sale. 

Dr. Nathaniel Lord Britten's *• Manual of the Flora 
of the Northern States and Canada " is published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It is based upon the text 
of the "Illustrated Flora "of Messrs. Britton and Brown, 
but the descriptions are condensed, and the cuts are 
omitted altogether. This makes it possible to condense 
the three volumes into one, and the use of thin paper, 
small type, and narrow margins makes this one of very 
moderate dimensions, considering the immense amount 
of matter it contains. The number of species is 4,162, 
and there are 1,080 pages.

The English Exploratibn of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony." "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhnnk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and " Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

NEW BOOKS FOR IMME- 
DIATE PUBLICATION 



RUSSIAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS 

By MAXntE KOVALEVSKT, former Professor of Public Law at the University of Moscow. 
A sketch of Russian Political Institutions, Past and Present. The book is based on a series of lectures delivered at the University of 
Chicago during the summer of 1901, and the account takes up the early history of the Russian nation and traces the development of its political 
institutions from the earliest periods to the present time. A complete exposition is given of the judicial and military systems with a discussion 
of the subject of personal liberties of Russian subjects. The position of Poland and Finland with reference to the Russian empire is discussed 
in detail, and light is given on many important topics of vital interest in this country at the present time, which are likewise unsolved prob- 
lems among the European nations. The book will be one of the few publications in the English language bearing directly upon Russian 
political history, and Professor Kovalevsky's position in Europe makes it especially valuable for students of political science and of the 
present-day topics. The volume will contain about 400 pages, and will be on sale about December 15. 

COURS COMPLET DE LANQUE FRANCAISE 

By MAXIME INGRES, Assistant Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures in the University of Chicago.

examples of things which all or most of us remember very easily or 
surely ; to examine why we remember them ; and then to see what 
method* and means of remembering may be suggested by these exam- 
ples. ... I have suggested for consideration just a few ideas which 
may help readers to find out for themselves what are the truest and 
best lines of memory-culture /"r them. It remains for them to develop 
and to Improve upon these ideas, and to tell me where and why I am 
wrong."

"This is a very good introduction to the shell-bearing creatures of 
British waters, salt or fresh, and of the woods and lanes. Its chief 
aim is to arouse interest in the organic structure of the creatures 
themselves. From the Darwinian standpoint the book has a place and 
value of its own, which should recommend it to the student of nature 
behind a shell. The numerous and particularly excellent illustrations 
increase its value for the amateur in particular, to whom it is chiefly 
addressed. " — Academy.

WHAT FITTER HOLIDAY PRESENT THAN 

The Voyage of Ithobal 

By Sir EDWIN ARNOLD 

"'The Voyage of Ithobal' is a fine, stately, well-poised and well-managed poem, a work 
of fanciful history, which only a true artist could design or a poet accomplish, an epic in a day 
when we were beginning to wonder whether epics would ever be written again." — Philadel- 
phia Evening Telegraph. 

" Compares favorably with ' The Light of Asia.' " — St. Louis Globe- Democrat. 

" The most truly poetical work which Sir Edwin has accomplished. The subject is good, 
and the verse at its best far more nervous and sinewy than that of ' The Light of Asia.' " — 
Springfield Republican. 

" It is fluent and vigorous. His poem is a creditable addition to the long list of his 
writings in verse." — Chicago Dial. 

" It possesses both beauty and strength, and at times rises to measures and imagery that 
are almost majestic." — Chicago Record- Herald.

THE

Edited by 

LIONEL CUST, M.A., F.S.A. 

Director of the Gallery. 

Illustrating Every Picture in the National Portrait Gallery. 

Issued under the Sanction and with the j^utbority of the Trustees. 

Edition de Luxe Limited to 750 Numbered Copies. 

MESSRS. CASSELL & COMPANY have to announce that for some time past they have 
been engaged in the preparation of a Complete Illustrated Catalogue of the National Portrait 
Gallery, similar in style and character to that of the National Gallery which was published in 
1899-1900. 

The work will be printed upon a special paper, and the greatest care will be taken in the 
reproduction of the portraits by the most modern and perfect photographic process. In the National 
Portrait Gallery are represented all the leading personages of the British nation from the earliest 
times onward to the end of the nineteenth century. The Catalogue of that collection, containing 
every portrait in it, will thus be the one complete record in portraiture of Britain's greatness, and 
will possess an unequalled historical and biographical value. 

The work will be issued in two volumes, the first of which will be ready in December, 1901, 
and the second in the autumn of 1902. 

The price to subscribers will be ;^30.oo net^ and the work will only be supplied to those who 
subscribe for the two volumes. The publishers reserve to themselves the right to advance the 
price as copies become scarce. 

The work is based on the Official Catalogue of the National Portrait Gallery. The portraits, 
about 1300 in number, will be arranged in chronological order, and in addition to an alphabetical 
list of them an index to the artists will also be given. 

This EDITION DE LUXE will be limited to 750 copies, each of which will be numbered, 
and of which the allotment to the United States will be 100 copies. It will contain about 600 
pages bound in paper covers. The size of the paper on which the work is printed will be 12^ by 
8^ inches, and there will be large margins to the pages. 

Applications for copies may be forwarded at once, and will be registered in the order received. 

" The National Gallery" was issued in three volumes at ^^^.00 net, in 1899-1 goo. The 
edition was limited to woo copies. The allotment to the United States W2s 2^0 copies, of 
which only five copies remain unsold. The present price is ^y^.oo net, in paper covers.

you are at a disadvantage. 

The Critic 

JEANNETTE GILDER, Editor, 

Is the most useful, the most authoritative, the 
most "up-to-date," the most ably-conducted of 
all the literary and critical magazines. Books, 
writers, literary news and gossip, caricature, por- 
traiture, the fine arts, music, the drama — these 
are subjects which The Critic treats in its own 
unique way, sanely, justly, luminously.

Eight Drawings by F. C. Yohn. 150th ThoUSaJld. Price, ;^i.50. 

Hon. GEORGE F. HOAR (U. S. Senator) says: 

" I have read it with great pleasure and approval. Your pictures of the Yankee coun- 
trymen of the elder generation have nothing of exaggeration or caricature in them. I 
was born and bred among such people in old Concord." 
Rev. T. DEWITT TALMAQE says: 

" ' D'ri and I ' is a rare book, in style vivid, in thought elevated. Its influence will be 
healthful. I wish every young man and woman might read it for the lesson of its love 
motive. It makes you see clearly the difference between true and false love : you feel 
the peril of the one, the beauty of the other. All who are approaching that supreme 
moment when a word may change their destiny for good or evil, may get wisdom out of 
this book."

HALL CAINE says In an Interesting letter to a friend: 

"I have read with a great deal of pleasure James Creelman's stirring book. The picture 
he presents of his visit to the Vatican is admirably faithful to the atmosphere of the great 
house, as I know it." Again he says : " There cannot be a more sympathetic reader of 
Tolstoy than myself, but nowhere have I seen the essential sophism on which his great 
mind is built more plainly revealed than in these pages of conversation."

ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 

THORPE. 1765-1895. Illustrated with Maps, Analytical Table, 
* Contents, and Index. 3 vols., cloth, $7.50 net. 

The work is chronological without digression or interruption, thus 
contributing greatly to a ready comprehension of our National growth, 
and enabling a retentive mind easily to remember, in a connected way, 
the multitudinous incidents of our history. The story of National 
Government in the United States is told with cojisecutiveness, clear- 
ness^ amplitude^ and unity. 

VON HOLST. 1750-1861. With Index and Bibliography. 8 vols., 
' cloth, $12.00 net. 

A work unsurpassed and unrivalled in its field. It is keen and 
profound ; fearless and impartial in its judgments of men and measures ; 
vigorous and vivid alike in its delineation of events and its portraiture 
of parties and leaders. 

"His labors, indeed, have been immense. ... A work which 
every student must needs possess in its entirety." — The Nation. 

TUCKER. T^^'^^ted consecutively, section by section, beginning 
— at the preamble and concluding with the amend- 

ments. 2 vols., cloth, $7.00 net. 

" It is an exceedingly useful book to those who desire to learn, in a 
most pleasant way, the fundamental principles of our government, and 
an invaluable book of reference in all matters pertaining to the rise and 
growth of American institutions." — Grover Clevela.nd. 

The variations in the treatment of their theme by these great authors indicate 
strong differences in their works. Mr. Thorpe's books present in a calm and 
philosophical manner the orderly development of our constitutional 
system ; Von Hoist's work is a master's series of studies of political 
motives and actions; while Tucker's work presents a great study in 
the law of the Constitution. Not one of these masterpieces in Constitutional 
literature conflicts with the others.

not end until it has evolved an international code, and an international tribunal to interpret it.

tion of creating a wider and more sympathetic interest in 
his subject among young people. It consists of twenty 
short stories of stirring adventure and hairbreadth escape 
in the lives of little feathered dwellers within our shores. 
The stories are told by twenty different mother birds to

unconventional pictures of a feathered parent's way of

two Anthropolc^ists among the two great Berber tribes of 

modem Algeria — the Chawia and the Kabyles. Though 

the purely scientific reader will find plenty to interest 

him. he who is not so purely scientific will find little to 

tire or disgust. The book, in a word, is an a<uv)unt of 

travel among the descendants of an ancient race whose 

culture spread from one end of the Mediterranean to the 

other.'

MAGAZINE 

WHAT THE CRITICS SAY: 

The New York Times Saturday Review prints this letter from 
EDWARD W. BOK, editor of the Ladies' Home Journal^ written to a 
friend who had complimented him on an issue of that periodical : 



I thanh you for your kind words of commendation^ unde- 
served though they he. But pray never, even in kindness, 
speak of me as even one who understands the art of editing 
a modern magazine, much less to refer to me with emphatic 
adjectives, so long as the present editor of HARP E IV S 
MA GA ZINE is in the harness. Favor me hy buying a copy 
of the Christmas issue of that magazine and see for yourself 
an example of the highest art of magazine editing. Then you 
will see the shortcomings of all magazine editors in general, 
and in particular, those of Yours very sincerely. 



The Albany Argus says: 

The Christmas Number of HARPER'S MAGAZINE is an issue 
to make literary history — the best in years. 

The Home Journal, Nov. 28, says : 

The wealth of reading offered by HARPER'S at present is be- 
wildering, especially in fiction is this magazine rich, and the 
variety is sufficiently extensive to gratify all tastes. 

The Brooklyn Standard Union, Nov. 30, says : 

A magnificent specimen of modern magazine making. The color 
printing is a revelation of the possibilities along this line. 



Send in your subscription now to begin with the January number and we will send

Captain Bluitt: A Tale of Old Turley 

By Charles Heber Clark (MAX ADELER), author of " Out of the Hurly-Burly," etc. 

12mo, cloth extra, illustrated, $1.50. 

" Persons with long: memories and delicate sense of humor will be delighted by the annonncement of a noyel by 
'Max Adeler' (Charles Heber Clark). The author is almost the only humorist of twenty years ago whose books are 
still in large demand, and he is the only humorist of that period who has for twenty years refused to be funny — in print. 
' Captain Bluitt ' is a delightful compound of wit, wisdom, sentiment and sense." 



By the Higher Law. 



By JULIA HELEN TWELLS, Jr., author of "A Triumph of Destiny." 

Illustrated by "Pal." 12mo, cloth extra, $1.50. 

'' By the Higher Law " is a very dramatic novel of New York society life, written by one who is entirely familiar 
with the life of " the smart set." She writes with great power, her story turning upon a question of conscience, and holds 
the reader's attention and interest throughout.

By FREDERICK W. UNQER, war correspondent of the London Daily Express. Illustrated with more 
than 150 half-tones from the author's own photographs in the field. 

Crown 8vo, cloth extra, $2.00. 

" The beat of all the books published along the same lines. It is absolutely unbiased. . . . We recommend Mr. 
Unger's book above all others." — Public Opinion. 

" A concise and vivid statement of personal experiences with both Britons and Boers ; more interesting to the general 
reader than a history of the War." — The Outlook. 

" The feeling of weariness with which the usual narrative of a South African war correspondent is taken up dissipates 
itself quickly in the case of Mr. Unger's entertaining and instructive book. There are scores of entertaining anecdotes in 
the book." — John J. Holdkn in the Dial. 

"An absolutely truthful account." — New York World. 

" For stirring narrative, keen interest and truthful detail it is the most distinctive book that has as yet been published 
concerning the war in South Africa." — New York Commercial Advertiser.

A Summer Hymnal. 

By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE. $1.25. 

Marion Hablamd says : "For we have in the 'Hymnal ' one of the 
most exquisite pastorals of American life ever written. It is an 
Idyll — a 'Reverie,' than which nothing more charming has been 
offered to our reading public since Ik Marvel founded a school of his 
own fifty-one years ago. 

Our 'United Country' is proud of the State that has given us 
within a dozen years Charles Egbert Craddock and this later and 
gentler painter of Tennessee life."

" A distinct triumph, in many ways original. The author has made 
excellent use of his material and has clothed the whole adventure in 
a charming, innocent humor. The style of the book is excellent, and 
there is no inconsiderable amount of true dramatic situation which 
flames forth at unexpected moments." — Public Opinion, New York. 



Twelfth Edition. 

In Search of Mademoiselle. 

By GEORQE QIBBS. $1.50. 

" 'In Search of Mademoiselle,' by George Gibbs, is a gem. Let it 
be said unhesitatingly that of all the recent popular and wide-selling 
novels, colonial or otherwise, Mr. Gibbs's story stands way ahead in 
the writer's humble opinion of any of them. It outranks ' Richard 
Carvel,' it dims the lustre of ' Janice Meredith.' " — New York Press.

By L. de V. MATTHEWMAN. 
Pictured by C. V. DWIQQINS. $1.00. 

Tfte Living Church says of this book : " These sayings are nuggets 
of wisdom and furnish food for reflection to him who will reflect. 
They are sharp and peppery, but condiments assist digestion. The 
illustrations are more than good, they are unique and compelling. 
They intensify the maxims manifold. They are worth preserving."

In political importance, historic interest, commercial greatness, and social characteristics, London is the mistress of

Appletons' Holiday Fiction 

r\ APPLETON AND COMPANY'S Holiday fiction list includes the 
following novels. This list of favorite recent and new books will 
interest all classes of readers — there are novels of adventure, of society, 
the sea, the land, the forest, politics; novels of character; weird, imaginative 
romances ; and historical novels dealing with many times and many places. 



PIRST, the best sea tale in years — Mr. 
^ Brady's " The Quiberon Touch " (^$ i .50). 
The superb account of the sea fight at Quib- 
eron Bay, involving two vast squadrons, ranks 
with the chariot race in " Ben-Hur." Mr. 
Brady has done for the sea what no recent 
novelist has even dared to attempt. 

T T is a far cry to a country bank in Northern 
■^ New York. But the human interest here 
is as moving as in the other book. The author 
of" David Harum" (;^ 1.50), now in its 527th 
thousand, needs no introduction. Mr. West- 
cott's only other piece of fiction, " The 
Teller," a bright holiday story laid in homely 
scenes, has jumped into large sales because its 
author knew the heart of the people so pro- 
foundly and told its story so simply. (;^i.oo.) 

TJALL CAINE'S "The Eternal City" is 
^ -^ the season's great novel and the author's 
masterpiece. Here is the supreme appeal of 
our day — the cry of crushed men like the 
deep roar of the sullen sea. Rome, the city 
of the Emperors and the Popes, becomes the 
city of the people. (^1.50.) 

" A RT for art's sake " and art at so much a 
■**■ pound have an amazing encounter in 
the Bohemias of Chicago. Mr. Fuller's 
" Under the Skylights" — a tale of charming 
humor and delicate flavor — tells of the rubs 
of the shrinking apostles of sweetness with 
Philistinism. It is a medley as amusing as it 
is original, (j^i.50.) 



ONCE again the Middle West. Its stren- 
uous political life gives the stuff that 
Mr. Barr has used in " Shacklett," the account 
of a manly man. This novel describes the 
buccaneers of American politics, (j^i.fo.) 

AT the other pole is Miss Montresor. 
" The Alien " has all the subtle graces 
and charms that mark the clear-minded, warm- 
hearted woman who wrote "Into the Highways 
and Hedges." This new story, partly of En- 
glish, partly of South American life, plays upon 
the finest strings of the human heart. (^1.50.) 

JUMP back again 150 years to the Maryland 
of Carvel Hall, and you have the setting 
of one of the most fascinating tales of the 
American Colonies, Mrs. Lane's " Mills of 
God" — a romance of indescribable charm. 
Her story (in its 4th edition) is strong, distin- 
guished, vividly told ; hence it is an irresistible 
plea for purity and social integrity. (^1.50.) 

T^HE West has produced a genius in Mrs. 
^ Elia W. Peattie. " The Beleaguered 
Forest," a tale of the Michigan woods, has 
surpassing beauty — a vision whimsical and 
picturesque. (^1.50.) 

AKIN to this marvellous picture of the 
cold North is Gilbert Parker's " Seats of 
the Mighty." Mr. Parker has written books 
before and since this, but he has never equalled 
the tale that describes the fall of Quebec.

Appletons' Books for the Young 

pv APPLETON AND COMPANY present the following Holiday juvenile 
publications. The list includes books on patriotism, narratives of 
travel, adventure, recreation, school sports, and the sea ; legends of the 
South and of the North; tales of great historical and of fictitious 
characters ; stories for boys, for girls, for workers, for players, for good 
children, for queer children, for the whole American child world. 



"Stroke, stroke, 
Our crew is at the start." 

AND Ralph Henry Barbour's book, " Cap- 
tain of the Crew" ($1.20 net)^ is at the 
start of the long list of books we have made 
for young people. Ask anybody who has read 
" For the Honor of the School " ($1.50), or 
"The Half Back" ($1.50), by the same au- 
thor, if they want the new one for Christmas. 



MANY a boy who loves to read a Barbour 
book is just as happy studying birds. 
Boys, and girls, too, will appreciate " In the 
Days of Audubon" ($1.20 net\ by Butter- 
worth. This is the latest of a notable series 
by this author. 

\170ULDN'Tyou like to have been in Tad 
'' ' Lincoln's place and heard his father, 
Abraham Lincoln, tell stories ? Well, "Lincoln 
in Story " is the next best thing. A book of 
authentic stories by and about the martyred 
President by S. G. Pratt. (75 cents net.) 

NEXT to Lincoln is Uncle Sam himself. 
His Secrets, His Flag, His Navy, and 
His Soldiers are all described interestingly in a 
series of four volumes called " The Uncle Sam 
Series." ($3.50.) Easy governmental informa- 
tion for youngsters, that 's about it. 



jVTINE books about as many boys at sea, 
*■ ^ from young Paul Jones to Dewey; "The 
Young Heroes of Our Navy." The books 
are sold separately, however ($1.00 each), and 
there is no make-believe about them. 



BY the way, " A Sailor's Log," by Admiral 
Robley D. Evans, is a first-rate book for 
boys, and also for somewhat older ones. 
($2.00.) 

BOYS and girls ought to be interested in 
Old New York, and whoever reads " A 
Landmark History of New York" will be. 
It points out just where the great events in 
the city's history took place. ($1.50.) 

QUAINT old plantation days and ways 
are described in the two books by Joel 
Chandler Harris, familiar, always fresh,"Uncle 
Remus " ($2.00) and " On the Plantation " 

($1.50). 

HOW easily an intelligent and sympathetic 
story-teller can win his way with children, 
and that is just what David Starr Jordan, 
President of Stanford University, has done in 
giving us his string of stories in ** The Book 
of Knight and Barbara." ($1.50.)

THE MACMILLAN COMPANY 

ANNOUNCES THE COMPLETION OF A MOST VALUABLE 
WORK OF REFERENCE BY 

RUSSELL STURQIS, A.M., Ph.D., 

(Fellow of the American Institute of Architects), and Many Architects, 
Painters, Engineers, and Other Expert Writers, American and Foreign. 

A Dictionary of Architecture 

and Building 

In 3 vols., profusely illustratedj cloth, $18 net; half morocco, $30 net. 

ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE AND IMPORTANT WORKS IN THE LANGUAGE DEVOTED TO THIS DEPARTMENT OF ART AND 
INDUSTRY, Architecture and building, which are treated together in this book, has never had in the English language 
so complete and encyclopedic a dictionary. . . . This work aims to treat not alone of technical terms, but to deal in 
historic architecture and give brief biographical sketches of the prominent men who have practiced the art. . . . Cross- 
references are freely given, and the whole work shows a well studied scheme and careful, conscientious execution by able 
hands. It is one of great magnitude, and will prove a most valuable contribution to the professional and technical 
literature of the language. — JSew York Architects^ and Builders^ Magazine, 
A WORK for the use of the architect who desired to in- 



^ vestigate special points in the history or practice of the 
profession, and not less of the layman who desired to ac- 
quire that knowledge of architectural history and practice 
which belongs to general culture, there has not been, until 
now, in the English language, . . . The plan of the work 
is so sound, the execution so adequate, and the popular 
interest in the subject so extensive and so growing that the 
success of the book, from the bookseller's point of view, 
seems assured. Indeed, both plan and execution so com- 
mend themselves that it seems almost safe to say that, 
although the " American Dictionary of Architecture " may 
and should be supplemented from time to time, it does not 
seem at all likely that it will be superseded. — Montgomery 
Schuyler in the International Monthly, 



pERHAPS the thoroughly modem spirit which dominates 
and inspires the whole work is the feature that distin- 
guishes this book most strongly from the works in other 
languages which the seeker for definitions hitherto has 
perforce consulted. The writers of these articles are schol- 
arly men, but they are something more than scholars. They 
are not living in the past ; they are doing their work in the 
world to-day, and their point of view and their tone is a 
most satisfactory and practical mixture of culture with 
the recognition of the needs of the average American. . . . 
Now that it has appeared, this dictionary, many of whose 
articles extend to the dimensions of those in encyclopaedias, 
becomes indispensable in its field. — Boston Herald. 



"THE execution of it could not have been put in better hands. ... Its excellent typography, illustration and general 
manufacture, and close examination of the text justifies the conclusion that the dictionary will be one of the most 
satisfactory works of reference ever issued in this country. — New York Tribune. • 



Italian Sculpture of the 
Renaissance 

By L. J. Freeman, M.A. With 45 full-page plates. Cloth, 

8vo, $3.00 net. (Postage, 18 ets.) 

A satisfying permanent addition to the library of any reader at all 
interested in art. It not only supplies a good and well set forth ac- 
count of the individual Italian artists and their work, but contains 
also quite a little running comment on the tendencies of art in general 
and especially of sculpture, tending to stimulate the sense imagination 
rather than the literary. 



Hubert von Herkomer, R.A. 

A Study and a Biography 

By A. L. Baldry, author of "Sir J. E. Millais, Bart., 
P.R.A.: His Art and Influence," " Albert Moore : His 
Life and Works," etc. Limited Edition. Fully illus- 
trated, imperial 8vo, cloth, $15.00 net. (Expressage 
extra. ) 
A book which deals fully as much with the personal life of the 

artist as with his work. The exquisite buckram binding is from one 

of his own designs. 



French Furniture and Decoration of the Eighteenth Century 

By Lady Dilke, author of " The Renaissance in France," " French Painters of the Eighteenth Century," etc. Illustrated 
with about 65 gravures and half-tones. Cloth, 8vo, $10.00. 



The third portion of Lady Dilke's work on French Art in the 
Eighteenth Century. Private collections in Paris and England, as 
well as the Garde-Meuble-National, have been laid under contribu- 
tion, and over twenty of the finest pieces in the Wallace Collection 
at Hertford House have been reproduced. 



" This handsome quarto has, apart from its qualities as art history, 
a very practical value for all who adopt the rococo style for house 
decoration or who collect originals of the Pompadour's time. Lady 
Dilke, it will be remembered, is almost the only English critic who 
has treated this graceful art with sympathy and intelligence."

TWO C ENTE NNIALS. 

A few weeks ago, a famous New England 
institution of learning celebrated, with cere- 
monies at once brilliant and dignified, the sec- 
ond centennial of its birth. The occasion was 
in every way impressive; the sense of its par- 
ticipants for the spectacular and the artistic 
was gratified by the pomp and circumstance of 
academic processions and convocations ; the 
intelligence of those who shared in the event, 
whether as eye-witnesses or as observers from 
a distance, was gratified by the exhibition of 
high intellectual ideals and by the lesson of 
historical continuity of aim and achievement 
which the celebration evoked. Two hundred 
years of an ever-widening influence for good 
upon the community, of an ever-deepening de- 
votion to the truth that makes men free, con- 
stitute a heritage in which the men of Yale 
may take a just pride, and afford an earnest of 
the fact, half-forgotten at times by the most 
thoughtful of us in the stress of our modern 
materialism, that the life of the spirit still has 
its share in our national development, and still 
urges its insistent claim upon the better part 
of our nature. 

A few weeks later, a famous newspaper 
rounded out the first century of its existence, 
and, with pardonable pride, seized upon the 
occasion for a review of its past. The incidents 
of this celebration were a special historical issue 
of the newspaper, a complimentary banquet 
tendered to its present proprietors and editors, 
and the publication of a remarkable collec- 
tion of congratulatory letters and testimonials.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



There were no processions, no costumes, no 
academic functions — in the nature of the case, 
there could be none of these things — but there 
was a widespread feeling, which received mani- 
fold and often unexpected expression, that the 
newspaper in question had been one of the 
most active and beneficent agencies in the his- 
tory of our civilization during the entire hun- 
dred years of its publication. Those who are 
now directing the course of the " Evening 
Post " of New York have cause for self- 
congratulation in the record made for them by 
their predecessors, in the progress or triumph 
of the good causes for which their journal has 
unswervingly contended, and in the steadfast- 
ness with which its original aims have been 
pursued. No one to-day, with the century's 
history of that newspaper for a guide, could 
frame a more exactly truthful statement of its 
work than is provided by the programme 
printed in its very first issue : " The design of 
this paper is to diffuse among the people cor- 
rect information on all interesting subjects ; to 
inculcate just principles in religion, morals, and 
politics ; and to cultivate a taste for sound lit- 
erature." 

It is not our present purpose to speak in 
detail of the history or the achievements of 
either the college or the newspaper, but the 
close coincidence of their centennial celebra- 
tions has set us to thinking about their com- 
parative influence, and stai-ted the question as 
to which of the two has proved the more potent 
agency for good. The question is obviously 
one that cannot be decided definitely, yet some 
analysis of the equation presented may prove 
interesting, and an examination of its several 
terms will afford some basis for an intelligent 
opinion. 

Stated in its simplest form, the comparison 
takes the following shape : the college influ- 
ences a few hundred men, but its influence is 
exerted during the formative period of life, is 
steadily exerted for a number of years, and 
usually dwarfs all other influences during that 
period. The newspaper, on the other hand, 
appeals to many thousands of men, but its ap- 
peal is intermittent, and always subject to the 
competition of other influences. It is, more- 
over, an appeal made to men whose intellectual 
outlook is fairly well fixed, and whose opinions 
are not easily to be moulded. The college has 
the additional advantage of exerting social, 
artistic, emotional, and other extra-intellectual 
influences upon the men whom it brings to- 
gether ; while the newspaper, not bringing men 



together at all, is deprived of every hold of 
this sort upon them. On the other hand, the 
life of the collegian is a semi-cloistered exist- 
ence, offering limited opportunities for making 
actual use of the guidance so amply offered ; 
whereas the man for whom the newspaper is 
produced is in the thick of the world's con- 
flict, confronted every day by practical prob- 
lems of conduct, and to him the newspaper — 
that is, the sort of newspaper which provides 
the text for these reflections — comes just at 
the time of need, and brings its trained intelli- 
gence or its broad social philosophy to bear 
upon the question at issue. This is its special 
opportunity, and here, in proportion as the 
reader believes in its honesty and its sincerity, 
does it directly influence him to action. 

We hesitate to strike a balance in a case 
like this, where none of the terms concerned 
can be reduced to quantitative shape, yet it 
seems reasonably clear that the right sort of 
newspaper — the one that always puts truth 
above party, intelligence above passion, and 
philosophy -above prejudice — may be at least 
as worthy an agency of the higher civilization 
as the largest university. Specifically, we 
should hesitate to say that any one of our edu- 
cational institutions had wrought more effect- 
ively for good during the past hundred years 
than the newspaper now under consideration. 
But it would be impossible to name another 
American newspaper of which this might be 
said for so long a period, or perhaps for any 
period. However, one example is enough for 
proof of our contention, and that example is 
afforded by the hundred years of honest and 
independent journalism for which the paper 
of Hamilton, and Coleman, and Bryant, of 
Messrs. Schurz, White, and Godkin, stands 
to-day in the estimation of the educated public. 

The striking thing about this example of 
successful journalism in the higher sense is that 
the success has been achieved under competi- 
tive conditions. The newspaper in question 
has been a paying enterprise without sacrific- 
ing anything of its honesty or independence. 
While other journals have achieved a commer- 
cial success by the sale of editorial opinions, or 
by allying themselves with special interests, 
and suppressing the truth wherever it was 
likely to imperil those interests, this journal 
has kept clear of all such entanglements and 
insincerities, and furnished an object-lesson of 
clean journalism unaffected in its course by the 
claims of the counting-room. The plea for 
venal and vulgar newspaper enterprise usually

takes the form of saying that papers must be 
sold and advertisers placated ; this newspaper 
has by its example retorted that the truth must 
be told and honest opinion expressed, no mat- 
ter what the effect upon sales and advertise- 
ments. And it is a great thing to have proved, 
even by a single courageous example, that un- 
der such conditions the financial returns may 
safely be left to take care of themselves. 

This may be taken as an argument against 
our old hobby of the endowed newspaper, but 
we propose to convert it into an argument in 
favor of such an undertaking. For with all 
that has been legitimately achieved for dignity 
and independence in the case now under con- 
sideration, we believe that much more might 
be achieved were a newspaper freed from the 
necessity of making itself pay. In the first 
place, it might appeal to a far wider range of 
interests, and enlist the cooperation of a far 
greater number of authoritative writers. If it 
were frankly to assume the position assumed 
by every college of high standing and offer its 
beneficiaries a service that did not pretend to 
be measured by what was paid for it, there 
would be an immeasurable enlargement of its 
possibilities for good. This is the result that 
might be reached by a liberal endowment, and 
this alone would place a newspaper upon the 
footing of a university. Even the best of 
newspapers is forced to depend upon the ad- 
vertiser for its main support, and the columns 
which are filled with advertisements must 
stand in startling contrast to the columns that 
are filled with news and expert opinion. In 
the very nature of the case, and under the best 
possible conditions, the advertising columns 
of a newspaper are largely given up to special 
pleading and misrepresentation. The com- 
mercial newspaper, however good its inten- 
tions, must make this compromise with con- 
science, trusting to the intelligence of its readers 
to make due discrimination between the printed 
page that is bought and the printed page that 
is unpurchasable. The great advantage of a 
newspaper that should be strictly an educa- 
tional enterprise, properly supported by en- 
dowment, would be that it need not depend 
upon the advertiser for any part of its support. 

Our attention has been directed to this 
aspect of the case by an incident in the late 
history of the very journal of which we have 
been speaking in such terms of deserved praise. 
During the recent political campaign in the 
city of its publication, that journal was enlisted 
heart and soul upon the side of civic right- 



eousness. Yet in the very thick of the contest, 
its columns gave daily display, in the form of 
paid advertisements, to the specious special 
pleadings of the partisans of corruption and 
civic disgrace. There was no disguise about 
the proceeding ; the advertisements were 
marked as such, and, according to the accepted 
ethical code of the journalist's profession, the 
thing was perfectly legitimate. Yet a higher 
code than this is readily conceivable, and such 
a code would be made possible by the endow- 
ment of journalism. Since we are determined 
to view the ideal newspaper as belonging in 
the same category with the university, the ab- 
surdity of the existing practice appears clearly 
enough when we point out that its educational 
analogue would be offered by a university that 
should open certain of its classrooms to the 
advocates of dishonest money and faith-healing 
and astrology, thus flouting the very image of 
truth, in whose name alone a university has 
the right to exist. The fact that the institu- 
tion derived support from this barter of its 
shelter and its sanction would not condone 
such an offense against educational morality, 
nor, rightly considered, is the corresponding 
offense on the part of a newspaper to be 
condoned.

THE MAX MiJLLER LIBRARY OF JAPAN. 
( To the Editor of Thb Dial. ) 

A recent issue of the " Japan Mail " has the following 
information regarding the Max Miiller collection of 
books lately presented to the Imperial University: 

" Baron Iwasaki [the donor] stipulates that the 
library shall always be differentiated from other books 
and distinguished as the "Max Miiller Library"; that 
every facility shall be granted to stndents desiring to 
consult the volumes, and that precautions shall be 
adopt«d to prevent the dispersal or injury of the books. 
The total outlay connected with its acquisition will be 
thirty-six thousand yen, the purchase having been 
effected at the price fixed by the great Orientalist himself 
on his death- bed, namely, three thousand pounds sterling. 
Tokyo papers publish the letter addressed by Baron 
Iwasaki to the Imperial University when presenting the 
library, and add that the first steps to bring about that 
result were taken by Mr. Elato, late Minister of State 
for Foreign Affairs, and were seconded by Baron Suye- 
matsu. They also publish a verbatim translation of 
Professor Max Miiller's statements with reference to 
the library — statements dictated from his death-bed, — 
which show that he regarded the collection of books as 
of the highest value to students of philology and com- 
parative religion, and that many of the most important 
volumes have copious marginal notes from his own 
hand." Erkest W. Clement.

llEMlNISCENCES OF AN ENGLISH 

Caricaturist. * 



Mr. Harry Furniss is given the distinction 
by some of being the greatest caricaturist En- 
gland has ever known, — and a short review of 
the satirical art in that country reveals the 
most famous names in the history of caricature. 
Although it does not come within the scope of 
the interesting volumes which Mr. Furniss has 
given us in " The Confessions of a Carica- 
turist," it may be timely, in view of the pre- 
vailing interest in the subject, to glance back 
a few score years. We find little of importance 
in the history of English art in the grotesque 
and comic prior to that time when the appear- 
ance of Hogarth marked a new epoch. And 
it would be superfiuous here to recapitulate in 
detail the achievements of that great domestic 
painter ; particularly as his powers in caricature, 
properly so called, though great, were subordi- 
nate to his higher merits as a painter of 
"genre," as the French phrase it, a delineator 
of popular scenes and incidents into which the 
humorous only entered as an ingredient. As 
a political caricaturist, Hogarth was a failure ; 
he left no school of followers. It was later, 
when the incubus of the war with America was 
removed, and domestic faction reappeared in 
all its pristine vivacity, that there appeared the 
first great English comic artist — James Gill- 
ray. Gillray has been described as the Rubens 
of caricature. Anyone who has studied Ru- 
bens's crowds of nude figures which approach 
nearest to the order of caricature will appreciate 
the justice of the parallel. Gillray was coarse 
to excess, both in conception and execution. 
He possessed only one quality which was Ap- 
parently discordant with his ordinary char- 
acter : his delineations of female beauty were 
singularly successful, and he dwelt on them 
with special pleasure, for the sake, perhaps, 
of the contrast with his usual disfigurements 
of humanity. Rowlandson was endowed with 
much of Gillray's coarseness, but with little of 
his satirical power and none of his artistic 
genius. James Sayer, a contemporary of Row- 
landson, possessed a certain amount of original 
talent as a political caricaturist. Henry Bun- 
bury was but the forerunner of the famous

nisa. In two volumes. Illustrated. New York : Harper &

French school of grotesque artists. George 
Cruikshank is now almost forgotten as apolitical 
caricaturist ; it was as an etcher of small figures 
that he excelled, in which humor and an ex- 
quisite appreciation of the ludicrous alternate 
with beauty and pathos. He was the last 
actual representative of the school of political 
caricaturists of the reign of George lU. But 
another worthy name follows upon his time : 
we refer to Richard Doyle, the famous " H. B." 
of the past generation. When Doyle ceased 
his labors, the " Punch " school of satirists 
began theirs, and the spirit of the art survived — 
as it will do so long as England retains a sense 
of the ludicrous. 

English caricature in the early days was 
characterized by the unnatural qualities of 
ferocity and truculency. Subjects were por- 
trayed in such phases of life as civilization 
shudders at and veils. To the caricaturist 
nothing was indecent or inappropriate. Un- 
popular politicians were shown only as types 
of human depravity. It was a sad contrast to 
the commendable work of Du Maurier and Sir 
John Tenniel. Charles Keene, one of the truest 
humorists of them all, played upon the follies of 
the middle and lower classes in a manner that 
delighted the drawing-room, and the people 
of to-day applaud his efforts. Gillray is as 
remote from them as Aristophanes ; Rowland- 
son as impossible as Rabelais. At the present 
time the prime requisites of English carica- 
ture are neatness, grace, good-breeding, a 
touch of sentiment, and a clear understanding 
of life. 

We can now appreciate Mr. Furniss's posi- 
tion as the greatest caricaturist England has 
ever known. His work is distinguished by a 
remarkable versatility of talent, by a great 
fecundity of imagination, and by a skill in 
grouping quite equal to that of Gillray. His 
criticism of life, thoroughly conventional as it 
is, is so roundly and vigorously expressed as to 
command attention, and is moreover touched 
with the elemental quality of pure and genuine 
humor. 

Harry Furniss was born in Ireland, in the 
town of Wexford, on March 26, 1854. When 
a child his parents moved to Dublin, and at the 
age of twelve he entered the Wesley an Con- 
nexional School, now known as Wesleyan Col- 
lege, where he struggled through his first pages 
of CaBsar and " stumbled " over the " pons 
asinorum." While yet a boy in knickerbockers 
he edited a periodical, under the ambitious title 
of " The Schoolboy's Punch," and it was a car-

toon drawn for this juvenile publication which 
determined the great caricaturist's career. 
Drawing seemed to come to him naturally and 
intuitively. In 1873, after an encouraging con- 
versation with Tom Taylor, then presiding gen- 
ius of the " Punch " table, he left Dublin, and 
his imaginary walks down Fleet Street became 
a reality. His first serious work in London was 
for the " Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic 
News." In 1880 his first contribution to 
*' Punch " appeared, and thereafter his humor- 
ous hieroglyphics were a regular feature of 
that famous weekly. 

His work, however, was not limited to po- 
litical satire and Parliamentary caricature. 
When one of the leading religious journals 
wished to present, as a series of supplements, 
portraits of the leading clergy, he was selected 
as the artist. 

" If I confess as a caricaturist, surely I must uot cari- 
cature my confessions by any mock-modesty. ' Punch ' 
required funny little figures, and I supplied them; but 
my metier, I must confess, was work requiring more 
demand upon direct draughtsmanship and power. I am 
a funny man, a caricaturist, by force of circumstances; 
an artist, a satirist, and a cartoonist by nature and train- 
ing. The one requires technical knowledge — in the 
other ' drawing does n't count.' The .serious confession 
that I have to make is that I have been mistaken for a 
caricaturist in the accepted and limited meaning of the 
term. *It is the ambition of every low comedian to 
play Hamlet, that of every caricaturist to be able to 
paint a picture which shall be worthy a place on the 
walls of the National Gallery,' are my own words on 
the platform; but I do not essay to play Hamlet, nor 
do I paint pictures for posterity in my studio. There- 
fore I do not place myself in the category of either, 
for I am neither a low comedian nor am I strictly 
and solely a mere caricaturist." 

As we glance over the two hundred odd 
illustrations included in his volumes, we realize 
that Mr. Furniss's range is practically unlim- 
ited. He is possessed of the power of rendering 
the traits of all ages, temperaments, and call- 
ings, — boys and girls, men of letters and 
women of society, the gay and the thoughtful, 
the vicious and the good. He presents them 
to us in their pleasures, their pursuits, their 
joy, and their gravity. Whatever the subject, 
it has the air of being native and spontaneous. 
His male figures redound with a certain vigor, 
and are discriminated by the strongest traits 
of individuality. In the sentiments he ex- 
pressed on the countenances, he had often the 
choice of many moods, and he always appears 
to have selected the ruling passions. When 
he departs from the literal flesh and blood 
facts, he magnifies the mental traits. 

Mr.'Furuiss desciibes a caricaturist as an 



artistic contortionist, who is grotesque merely 
for effect. 

" A contortionist twists and distorts himself to cause 
amusement, but he is by nature straight of limb and a 
student of grace. Thus also is it with the caricaturist 
and his pencil. The good points of his subject must 
be plainly apparent to him before he can twist his study 
into the grotesque. Perchance he may even entertain 
a feeling of admiration for the subject he is holding tip 
to ridicule, for serious moments and serious work are 
no strangers to the caricaturist." 

For some years Mr. Farniss worked with 
" Lewis Carroll," in illustrating that author's 
humorous books. 

" Carroll was as unlike any other man as his books 
were unlike any other author's books. It was a relief 
to meet the pure, simple, innocent dreamer of children, 
after the selfish commercial mind of most authors. 
Carroll was a wit, a gentleman, a bore, and an egotist — 
and, like Hans Andersen, a spoilt child. He was not 
selfish, but a liberal-minded, liberal-handed philan- 
thropist, but his egotism was all but second child- 
hood. . . . To meet him and to work with him was to 
me a great treat. I put up with his eccentricities — 
real ones, not sham like mine. I put up with a great 
deal of boredom, for he was a bore at times, and I 
worked over seven years with his illustrations, in which 
the actual working hours would not have occupied me 
more than seven weeks, purely out of respect for his 
genius. I treated him as a problem and I solved him, 
and had be lived I probably would have still worked 
with him." 

He speaks of Gladstone as a study as fascinating 
to the artist as to the politician, and claims 
that no portrait ever drawn by pen or pencil 
can hand down to future generations the mys- 
terious subtlety in personality of the all- 
powerful leader. 

It was in 1887 that Mr. Furniss perpetrated 
his celebrated artistic joke — a bold parody 
on a large scale of an average Royal Academy 
Exhibition. This exhibition, which, it has 
been said, any man of less audacious and 
prodigious power of work would have shrunk 
from in its very inception, was held at the 
Gainsborough Gallery. It consisted of some 
eighty-seven pictures of considerable size, exe- 
cuted in monochrome, and presented to a mar- 
velling public travesties — some excrutiatingly 
humorous and daringly satirical, others really 
exquisite in their rendering of physical traits 
and landscape features — of the styles, tech- 
niques, and peculiar choice of subjects of a 
number of the leading artists, " R. A.'s " and 
others, who annually exhibit at Burlington 
House. As one reviewer puts it : 

" London had never seen anything so original as 
Harry Furniss's Royal Academy. The work of one 
man, and that man one of the busiest professional men 
in towu ! ludfcd it might be thought that at the age 



506

[Dec. 16, 



of thirty, with all the foremost magazines and journals 
waiting on his leisure, with a handsome income and an 
enviable social position, ambition could hardly live in 
the bosom of an artist in black and white. Unlike 
Alexander, our hero did not sit down and weep that no 
kingdom remained to conquer, but set quietly to work 
to create a new realm all his own. His Royal Academy, 
although presented to the public as an ' artistic joke,' 
showed that he could not only use the brush on a large 
scale, but that he could compose to perfection, and after 
the exuberant humor of the show, nothing delighted 
and surprised the public more than the artistic quality 
and finished technique in much of his work — a finish 
far and away above the work of any caricaturist of our 
time." 

On his first visit to America, Mr. Furniss 
was amazed at the commercial spirit which 
characterized New York City, and felt that the 
streets were simply museums of grotesque ad- 
vertisements. What impressed him most about 
the metropolis was not the Brooklyn Bridge, 
nor Wall Street, nor the elevated railway, 
but — the number of chiropodists' advertise- 
ments ! Speaking of the American newspaper 
interviewer, he says : 

" Major Hospitality arrested me on the moment I 
arrived, and banded me over to Inky Inquisition — 
eight gentlemen of the press — who placed me on the 
interviewer's rack at the demand of insatiable modern 
journalism. . . . And then to be handed a bad pen, 
and worse paper, and have to draw pictures in pen and 
ink, in the space of five minutes, for the eight gentlemen 
who were watching to see 'how it's done.' I have 
sketched crowned heads on their thrones, bishops in 
their pulpits, thieves in their dens, and beauties in their 
drawing-rooms ; but I never felt such nervousness as I 
did when I had to caricature myself on the occasion of 
my first experience of American interviewing." 

Though his visit to this country was merely a 
pleasure trip, he soon found himself in the 
hands of the " irrepressible lecture agent," of 
whom he says : " Major Pond is a typical 
American, hospitable, kind, with an eye to 
business, but I do not appear in his interesting 
book, nor was I ever on his business books 
either." In a reminiscent manner he frames 
his opinions of metropolitan life — from the 
hungry politician to the American girl, from 
the Bowery to Central Park, from Baxter 
Street to Fifth Avenue. 

Comparing the seats of government in 
America and Great Britain, he submits the 
following un-English view : 

" The seating of the senators in these two assemblages 
(the Senate and the House of Lords) is typical of the 
countries they represent. In the British House of 
Lords the Peers loll about on scarlet sofas; in America 
the chosen ones sit at desks. The British Peer has 
forsaken one lounge to occupy another; the American 
has left the office desk for the desk in office. In Brit- 
ain the House of Lords is composed of Princes and i 



Peers, with an admixture of bishops, brewers, and other 
political party pullers; it is also an asylum for stranded 
political wrecks from the Lower House. Soldiers and 
sailors, too, are honored and sent there, not as politi- 
cians, but merely to exist for the time being in a sort 
of respectable retreat, before being translated to the 
crypt of Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's. John Bull 
has made this hereditary hotch-potch, and he must 
swallow it. Jonathan selects his senators to his own 
taste, and has them dished up fresh from time to time. 
The Senate is not sombre and sedate as our Upper 
House, but simplicity itself — no gilded throne, no 
Lord Chancellor in wig and gown, no offensive offi- 
cialism." 

Space forbids quoting further from these 
vivacious " Confessions," which furnish many 
hours' entertainment. Mr. Furniss has written 
one of the most interesting autobiographies in 
recent English literature. He is a clever 
raconteur, and, whether describing his Parlia- 
mentary career, his tour in America, or his 
London club experiences, his mind is alert on 
seizing the salient features of the life about 
him. The interesting drawings and sketches, 
which have already been referred to, form a 
valuable portion of the book, and the publish- 
ers have done their share to make the volumes 
attractive. ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ 



Mil. HOWELI.S TALKS OF FICTION.* 



Mr. W. D. Howells is a master in what I 
may call the chronicle-chat of literature. His 
tone of kindly confidence coupled with ample 
authority, and always the air of conceding to 
the reader the right of his own opinion, makes 
him a delightful companion in a literary con- 
ference — that solitude a deux which is as 
pleasant for literature as for life. In fact, Mr. 
Howells is that rare thing, a genuine essayist, 
— a man who in a richly human way and with 
frank impressionism tells us of his likes and 
dislikes, inviting confessions in return. This 
impressionism in letters is most winsome and 
stimulating, — in the right hands, as here. 

The reflection is inspired by his latest con- 
tribution to literary criticism, the " Heroines 
of Fiction," furnished bravely forth by the 
publishers, as befits the season, in two large 
handsome volumes for which sundry capable 
artists have made some seventy full-page draw- 
ings. It may as well be said here that nothing 
is more dangerous than to force the eye phys- 
ical to see a creature of fiction already familiar

to the eye spiritual. Even when the render- 
ing is sympathetic and charming, it is another 
girl, for the girl you know, — and so a shock. 
Personally, I prefer my heroines un illustrated. 
This is not at all a stricture on the admirable 
art-work of these seemly books. 

The field covered is a wide one, practically 
the whole life of English fiction from Richard- 
son to our own day. For although Mr. Howells 
proposes at the outset to confine himself to the 
nineteenth century heroines of Anglo-Saxon 
fiction, he finds the eighteenth century types 
not only of Richardson but of such other 
writers as Edgeworth, Austen, and Burney are 
really modern and should come into the pur- 
view. And so some of the most enjoyable and 
suggestive pages deal with these earlier women 
of the native imagination. 

Such a study is really a sally into cultur- 
geschichte ; for the ideals of a period are well 
reflected in the social place and power of its 
women. Mr. Howells is happily sympathetic 
to his theme, because he is aware of this fact, 
and, too, because with him the underlying test 
of truth is always applied to a fiction, while 
his belief in the growth of social decency along 
with a finer art, makes him a keen analyst of 
society past and present, as well as of litera- 
ture. 

Readers aware of his views on fiction — of 
the principles he has long championed and 
portrayed — will not be surprised to meet with 
them here, always expressed with a winning 
tolerance and a welcome clarity. His doctrine 
is found in a nutshell in volume I, p. 26, 
when, speaking of eighteenth century fiction, 
he says it " had not yet conceived of the su- 
preme ethics which consist in portraying life 
truly and letting the lesson take care of itself." 
One feels like adding that this is quite ac- 
ceptable in the case of Mr. Howells, whose 
lessons are wholesome, but less so when the 
message is of another sort. What gives these 
talks on fiction dignity and value are the fre- 
quent glimpses afforded of bye-gone manners 
and morals, the atmospheric way in which the 
evolution of society is pictured, decade by 
decade, in standard novels during the life of 
that literary form. Only the really great 
critic, for example, can give off-hand, as it 
were, such an admirable explanation as does 
he of the successive changes of moral tone in 
the late eighteenth century and the early and 
late nineteenth century as mirrored by Burney, 
Austen, Thackeray, and, say, a contemporary 
writer like Mr. Hardy. 



In a general way, Mr. Howells is happiest 
with those fictional creations whose authors 
have used his own method — that of the realist. 
Hence, particularly charming is his hand- 
ling of the women types (or female figures, as 
she would have called them) of Jane Austen ; 
also those of such later masters as Thackeray 
(whom he very properly points out to be by 
no means a consistent realist), Trollope, or 
Mr. Hardy. His attitude toward the roman- 
ticists makes him a bit less sympathetic perhaps 
to the children, fair or foul, of their making ; 
yet the strictures are so frank, so gently put, 
and so intensely honest (it is always a principle 
not a person with this wise critic) that they 
carry the more weight, whatever one's opinion. 
Indeed, it is a triumph of Mr. Howells's fair- 
mindedness and response to the great by what- 
ever method conveyed, that what he writes of 
Dickens is one of the best things in the two 
volumes, to be read with pleasure and profit 
by all lovers of the Master of Gadshill. Often, 
too, Mr. Howells's pen unerringly pierces the 
gaps in the armor of some great romanticist's 
art, his aim being all the surer in that his con- 
viction that romance is not fiction's last and 
best word directs his peaceful missile — the 
pen that is mightier than the sword. This is 
especially applicable to Scott, whose defects 
are touched with a sort of loving sorrow, while 
his mighty qualities are at the same time at- 
tested to. 

Just a word on the style of these essays. 
Idiomatic English, vernacular that is easy yet 
not vulgar, is what Mr. Howells always writes. 
He is a deceivingly good writer ; I mean it 
takes some culture in speech, in literature, to 
realize how good he is. His feeling for idiom 
makes him daringly radical ; he uses such 
phrases as " falls down," " it went," '• faking," 
and yet others, in their popular signification. 
But in the setting which he gives them they 
add piquancy, and, for my ear, are void of 
offense. 

The charm of this intimate, leisurely causerie 
can only be shown in quotation and must here 
be taken on trust. Those acquainted with Mr. 
Howells's attractive manner of literary criti- 
cism need only to be assured that these volumes 
embody a characteristic study — fruit of his 
ripest. For those (if such there be) to whom 
this leader in our letters is less familiar, let it 
again be said that the essay in its elder, nobler, 
and more alluring mood is not better illustrated 
in our day than by his work.

The Tklte Thomas Jkffkkson.* 



The author of the latest addition to the 
" true " accounts of the lives of famous Amer- 
icans asserts that the book is not so much a 
formal biography as a series of sketches of a 
remarkable man — a red-haired, blue-eyed man, 
who came to the Continental Congress in 1775, 
when he was thirty-two years old and almost 
the youngest man in the body, bringing with 
him " a reputation for literature, science, and 
a happy talent for composition." 

" It was whispered about that, in addition to Latin 
and Greek, he understood French, Italian, and Spanish, 
was learning German, and intended to master Gaelic 
(if he could get the books from Scotland); that he 
could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an ar- 
tery, plan an edifice, try a case, break a horse, dance a 
minuet, and play the violin, — a long list of accom- 
plishments that were admired by the sixty serious 
gentlemen in silk stockings and pigtails who sat in the 
plain brick building up a narrow alley in Philadelphia 
and called themselves ' the honorable Congress.' " 

Before Jefferson died, his versatility found 
still further illustration in the invention of a 
folding chair, a revolving chair, a copying 
press, an odometer, a pedometer, and a coinage 
system ; to say nothing of making ploughs and 
proverbs, introducing merino sheep, Calcutta 
hogs, and olives; writing the Declaration of In- 
dependence, organizing a political party, found- 
ing a college, and breaking the Constitution. 
Frequent extracts from his account books show 
a lavish expenditure for entertainment of 
friends that easily accounts for his bankruptcy, 
and yet reveals the strange phenomenon of a 
founder of a political party, who was its great- 
est leader, and yet for whom it is claimed that 
he never gave a dollar to influence an election, 
but on the contrary favored barring from office 
anyone who spent money for such purposes. 

Such a character was an ideal man for a 
newspaper correspondent to describe, and so 
Mr. Curtis's little volume, in colonial buff and 
blue, gives us an interesting collection of mis- 
cellaneous material that affords the reader a 
notion of the times in which Jefferson lived, 
and perhaps enables him to have a better con- 
ception of the man than would be gained from 
an historian who discussed his career from a 
political standpoint alone. 

Some of the familiar quotations are inaccu- 
rate ; here and there are contemporary stories 
too good to be overlooked and therefore ascribed 
in this case to Jefferson ; and some of the ma-

terials are poorly digested, so that repetitions 
occur which a more careful examination of the 
manuscript would have eliminated. The gen- 
eral impression, however, is favorable, for the 
volume is full of suggestions and comparisons 
that tend to show how the man moved in his 
environment, and how the society of his time 
differed from the surroundings of public men 
to-day. For example, the picture is a striking 
one which shows two rural Virginians helping 
each other to train for high office, the one plan- 
ning to have the other — his close friend 
always — for his political heir. The great Vir- 
ginians are all introduced, and then comes this 
stinging criticism of the Old Dominion : 

" Thomas Jefferson honored Virginia more than any 
other of her sons except George Washington; but Vir- 
ginia, one of the greatest and most ungrateful of states, 
has not honored Thomas Jefferson. His neighbors, to 
whose welfare he devoted so much time and labor, and 
to whom his achievements brought so much glory and 
honor, permitted him to die destitute, and his family 
to be driven by poverty from their home. They per- 
mitted his estates to pass into the hands of aliens who 
now stand in his footprints and measure the value of 
his greatest gift to the people of his state, — the Uni- 
versity of Virginia, which they have never fully appre- 
ciated. They allowed his grave to be trampled upon 
and his tomb to be desecrated, and the general govern- 
ment to restore the monument that was erected to his 
memory, and a citizen of New York to preserve and 
occupy the mansion in which he spent the best years of 
his life. But Virginia also allowed the house of Wash- 
ington to pass out of her hands, the home of Madison 
to be sold under the hammer, and the ruins of James- 
town, the first civilized settlement on the continent of 
North America, to be bought at auction by a lady from 
Ohio who had the generosity to present it to a patriotic 
society of women. No state in the Union has furnished 
more great men than Virginia; none has done so little 
to honor them." 

The idea of Jefferson's fixed opposition to 
wholesale removals of Federalists, which finds 
expression in the statement that only thirty- 
nine officials were dropped during the eight 
years of his presidency, receives a rude shock 
when a table in this volume is examined show- 
ing a hundred and sixty-four changes out of a 
possible three hundred and thirty-four during 
the first term alone, — although one oft-quoted 
letter is cited in which Jefferson says : 

" So that sixteen only have been removed in the 
whole for political principles — that is to say, to make 
some room for some participation for the Republicans." 

Regarding Jefferson's power, it is stated : 

" Jefferson intended that the new nation should be a 
democracy ; and he would rather have let the whole 
world perish than that this purpose should fail. Never- 
theless, he was the most absolute monarch that ever sat 
in the Presidential chair. Although he introduced the 
practice of discussing all matters in his Cabinet and

deciding questions of importance by vote, his powerfal 
individuality and persuasive reasoning controlling [con- 
trolled ?] bis advisers in bis o£Bcial family and in 
Congress. He exercised an influence in botb bouses of 
the national legislature, and with the people, that has 
never been equalled by any of his successors. He 
formed a powerful party, be directed its action, and he 
selected its principles; but he never assumed the atti- 
tude of a " boss." He remained in the background, 
sheltered by the dignity of his office. He worked with 
singular silence and mystery, communicated his wishes 
to those who were loyal to him, and selected, those who 
were able to carry them out with the greatest sagacity. 
There has never been a more subtle or skilful strategist 
in American politics; there has never been a more ae- 
cnrate observer of public sentiment, nor a better judge 
of human nature. . . . 

" It is a curious fact that the founder of the party 
whose creed is that all authority belongs to the people 
alone was the greatest political dictator ever known in 
the United States; but it is equally true that the Dem- 
ocratic party has never been successful except under 
the direction and leadership of a dictator." 

Such quotations show the character of Mr. 
Curtis's " The True Thomas Jefferson," a vol- 
ume of illustrative material, stating details of the 
life of a great leader, showing faults and virtues 
alike, on the whole commendatory, but most 
valuable by reason of comparisons showing the 
United States of 1901 in opposition to that of 
1801, and indicating the place of Thomas 
Jefferson as a leader from the view-point of a 
century after his great achievements.

Four Cextubies of European 
Culture and Politics.* 



At last we have a record of intellectual pro- 
gress coordinate with political events, in the 
" Annals of Politics and Culture " by Mr. C. 
P. Gooch. One glances at first curiously at 
these pages, where on the left-hand is given 
year after year the political history of Europe 
since 1492, on the right-hand the chief events 
for the same period in the intellectual world, — 
the first being so much better known and so 
much more boisterous in making themselves 
known, the others of so much greater conse- 
quence for our progress from the savagery of 
assault and war to a basis of rational conduct. 
While on the one side we hear the thunder of 
cannon, the clash of arms, or the mockery of 
diplomacy, — remnants of a predatory life 
which still repeats itself with wearisome mo- 
notony, — on the other we behold the works of 

♦Annals of Politics and CuLxtmE (1492-1899). By

peace, or of such mental strife as secures the 
greater victories and demands the more patient 
toil. These last achievements seem for awhile 
to exist only by fits and starts, the current of 
progress alternately advancing and receding in 
its course ; but gradually the beaconlights of 
intelligence and discovery are kindled all over 
the vast area, answering each other from afar, 
and encouraging each other as they become 
more numerous and bright. The world does 
progress; these annals of culture tell us that. 
By them the hopeless are refuted, and the 
hopeful stimulated to greater effort. However 
much of barbarism and floundering ignorance 
are still left for us to combat, we may hope to 
see the steady growing of the light, both evil and 
good continuing to exist as each other's antithesis 
and urging each other on to the inevitable strug- 
gle that serves the mysterious principle of life. 

In looking through this book on the Culture 
side, England appears at first the most active 
and intelligent of European countries. This 
is largely for the natural reason that no other 
country receives such minute attention. Every 
phase of development is recorded, even such as 
seem to the outsider of very small moment 
indeed. For England, too, a timely explana- 
tion of the value of each departure in the line 
of intellectual or social development is added 
to most of the statements, while such help is 
often lacking in regard to the events of similar 
character in other countries. Many compilers 
have added to the volume of facts presented, and 
their contributions do not always show equal 
care in selection or fulness of presentation. 

The book contains the stately sum of 3765 
chief events in Culture and 2326 in Politics, — 
all these trebled or quadrupled in number by 
side-lights thrown upon other events not espe- 
cially recorded. And yet we think that the 
author of the Annals will be criticised, not so 
much for what he has put in as for what he 
has excluded. We predict that these Annals 
will ultimately swell to twice their present 
bulk, for such a work is likely to create disa- 
greement as to what should be included and 
what omitted. Germans and Frenchmen will 
doubtless have a good many things to say. As 
for us, realizing the difficulty of making a just 
selection in many fields, and grateful to the 
good Fates and Lord Acton that such a book 
has appeared at all, we shall make only a few 
suggestions. Under the rubric Art is men- 
tioned in due time Beethoven's "Fidelio," but 
nothing else of his, not even his Ninth Sym- 
phony. Taking the year 1823 as the date of

[Dec. 16, 



the completion of this opera, it appears strange 
that a work which stands as high in the history 
of music as Goethe's " Faust " in literature 
should be passed over in silence. Likewise, 
in the account of German achievements in 
history are entirely omitted the two Von 
Maurers, G. L. and K. Von Maurer, father 
and son, — one of whom established the study 
of agrarian conditions in Germany, the other 
known by his minute critical work in the com- 
parative study of Germanic laws with specific 
interest in the Anglo-Saxon period. This lat- 
ter subject is now attaining some importance 
in England, but has flourished in Germany 
since 1842. These men are unsurpassed in their 
field, and are veritable founders of schools, 
deserving to be mentioned, surely, in a place 
where so many lesser lights shine. Further, 
the beginnings and final success of the Postal 
Union, originating in Germany at the initia- 
tion of the imperial postal minister Stephan, 
are events of fully as great importance as the 
Zollverein, which is after all but of national 
concern, while the Postal Union is of universal 
significance. The name of Sophie Kovalewska 
ought not to be forgotten, either ; her winning 
the prize of the French Academy of Sciences, 
under the circumstances under which she 
gained that high honor, means a definite break 
with mediaeval and clerical notions of the ca- 
pacity of women. It is the logical conclusion 
of Mill's famous essay. And we might add 
the query, if Du Maurier is counted worthy of 
mention as a draughtsman for " Punch," why 
not also Keene, who had less mannerism and 
at least equal wit? 

In regard to matters of wording, and style 
in general, a few things might be said. The 
method of quoting the title of a book or names 
in English translation (which, it may be said, 
is not done consistently) seems unscholarly. 
Why not retain the original title, or at least 
print that in parentheses after the translation ? 
It is impossible to see the usefulness of trans- 
lating Des Knaben Wunderhorn, a name that 
has become universally known, into " The 
Boy's Wonderhorn "; it strikes the reader as 
flat in itself, and catering too much to the En- 
glish habit of having everything anglicised. 
But this is not so bad as calling Peder Dass's 
Nordlands Trompet " The Trumpet of Nor- 
way," which is altogether misleading. Why 
should Johann Sturm be called John Sturm, 
when that is not his name, and the change 
serves only to confuse the reader ? The faulty 
English spelling of German names occasion- 



ally crops out to offend the eye : why it should 
be Gunther instead of Giinther, Moser instead 
of Moser, or Holderlin instead of Holderlin, 
is quite inconceivable, since Bohmer and others 
are spelled properly. Abbt, it may be noted, 
should not be printed Abt. On the other 
hand, to print such hybrid mixtures as " The 
fruchtbringende Gesellschaft " or " The Auf- 
klarung " seems equally lacking in good taste ; 
why not "Die fruchtbringende," etc., or " The 
Enlightenment," since this period belongs to 
England as well as to Germany, or even more 
so. On the death-list appear various names 
not mentioned before in the text, and to most 
people entirely unknown. The average reader 
needs an encyclopsBdia to find out who are 
Ficino, Alciati, and numberless others who 
figure nowhere but among the deaths, as if this 
was their chief accomplishment. That Hol- 
berg's "Peder Paars " or Baggesen's "Comic 
Tales " are put under Dutch literature, instead 
of under Danish, will surprise both the Dutch 
and the Danes. Attention might be called to 
certain other oversights. The sentence on page 
33, note 191, makes it difficult to see to whom 
Ciceronianus is intended to belong, whether to 
Erasmus or to Longolius, the sentence being 
about as involved and obscure as if borrowed 
from Longolius himself. It is also sometimes 
difficult to understand the bearing of state- 
ments, such as the one on page 41, note 246, 
where Poor Laws and Begging are mentioned 
as forbidden (presumably in England) ; or 
in the line below, where the attempt to free 
land from Uses presumably concerns England 
again, while the succeeding line mentions 
manufacture of silk in Lyons by Italians, thus 
making the whole matter apparently concern 
France. The addition of the title of Emperor 
to Ferdinand, in the note on page 57, of his 
sending Bubequius to Constantinople, would 
solve one puzzle. We can easily see the ne- 
cessity of saving space, but there is space and 
to spare in the book for such explanatory ad- 
ditions. It is rather a pity that the many 
errata must be swelled by omissions which 
might easily have been corrected. 

All these matters of complaint being little 
things as compared with the great things that 
have been achieved in this beginning of the 
systematic record of intellectual progress, we 
do not feel it in our heart to end with anything 
but hearty expressions of our satisfaction with 
the book as a first and conspicuous attempt to 
enter a new and fruitful field.

The History of a Bogus Kixg.* 

It is perhaps not greatly to be regretted that 
the epoch of the Civil War and the Common- 
wealth has hitherto so largely engaged the at- 
tention of English historians that the period 
immediately following has been somewhat neg- 
lected. But now there are signs, in such recent 
publications as Dr. Osmund Airy's "Charles 
II.," Mrs. Ady's " Madame," and Mr. Fea's 
" King Monmouth," that the unsavory chron- 
icles of Charles the Second's court are to be 
made the subject of careful study on the part 
of specialists. 

Mr. Fea's elaborate and handsome work is 
worthy of note, if only for the beauty of its 
typography and binding and the number and 
excellence of its illustrations. The ill-fated 
career, too, of James, Duke of Monmouth, the 
natural son of Charles II., forms an important 
chapter in English history ; and considerable 
new material for a biography has come to light 
since the publication, in 1844, of Mr. George 
Roberts's excellent life of the Duke. Yet it is 
as a picture of the times, rather than of the 
man, that any recital of his adventures can be of 
value. Handsome, spirited, and brave in battle 
though he was, there is little in his intellect or 
character to command admiration. As was well 
said of him by the Comte de Gramont, " son 
esprit ne disoit pas un petit mot en sa faveur." 

In court morals, if in nothing else, there is 
decided evidence that we live in a better world 
than did our ancestors of two centuries ago. 
The Merry Monarch's weaknesses aroused so 
little reprobation that we find Lucy Walter's 
illegitimate son enjoying the honor and emolu- 
ments of numerous high offices. When scarcely 
out of his teens he was made Captain-General 
of all the king's forces. Privy Councillor, Lord 
Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Governor of 
Kingston-upon-Hull, Lord Lieutenant of East 
Yorkshire, and more besides ; while it was only 
the opposition of his uncle, the Duke of York, 
that prevented his appointment as Lord Lieu- 
tenant of Ireland. An annuity of six thousand 
pounds, afterward increased to eight thousand, 
was settled on him. Most astounding of all, 
this illiterate youngster was elected, at the age 
of twenty-five, to the Chancellorship of Cam- 
bridge University. Readers of Dryden's " Ab- 
salom and Achitophel " will not need to be

reminded that it was largely Shaftesbury's and 
Buckingham's influence that procured him this 
rapid advancement. But his royal father's 
fondness for the young scapegrace was such 
that he was sure to be well provided for in any 
case. A characteristic picture is given of the 
pleasure-loving monarch's mode of life at New- 
market, just after seeing his son off for a so- 
journ on the Continent. A morning walk, the 
cockpit, dinner, the cockpit again, the play, 
supper, " and so to bed," as old Pepys would 
gay, — such was King Charles's daily pro- 
gramme. 

The chief interest in Monmouth's career cen- 
tres, of course, in his invasion from Holland 
soon after his father's death, and in the battle 
of Sedgemoor which put an end to his kingly 
pretensions. Our author is inclined to support 
the charge of complicity on the part of the 
Prince of Orange in the fatal enterprise, Will- 
iam's motive being a natural desire to get rid 
of a popular and dangerous rival. The disas- 
trous issue of both Argyll's and Monmouth's 
undertakings must have been foreseen by so 
shrewd a statesman and so experienced a sol- 
dier. Mr. Fea makes but the briefest mention 
of the Duke of Argyll's unlucky raid, capture, 
and execution. As this invasion of Scotland 
was an essential part of the general scheme, a 
detailed account of it would have been desir- 
able. Of the battle of Sedgemoor — the last 
fight worthy to be called a battle fought on En- 
glish soil — a contemporary plan, drawn by the 
Rev. Andrew Paschall, is here printed for the 
first time. The rout of the rebels, the capture 
of Monmouth, his ignoble attempts to clear 
himself at the expense of his followers, and his 
execution on Tower Hill, are all described in 
full ; and we are left with a feeling of amaze- 
ment that one so unworthy could have com- 
manded such devoted support. It was from the 
humbler ranks that he drew his adherents, and 
so constant were the people to their idol that, 
even long after his death, they persisted in hop- 
ing for his reappearance among them. Cre- 
dence had been given to a false report that one 
of his followers had mounted the scaffold in 
his stead, and that " King Monmouth " him- 
self was safe and in hiding, biding his time for 
a second insurrection. So persistent was this 
belief that we even find Voltaire, some years 
after George III. had ascended the throne, 
gravely refuting the conjecture that the " Man 
in the Iron Mask" was in reality the Duke of 
Monmouth. One circumstance of importance 
is not to be forgotten in connection with Mon-

month's popularity : he stood, in the minds 
of the people, for the cause of Protestantism 
against Popery, and their hatred of the latter 
had recently been kindled to a white heat by 
Titus Oates and the so-called Popish Plot. 

The new material drawn upon by the author 
makes his book well worth the writing. He 
carefully cites his authorities in introduction 
and in numerous foot-notes. Macaulay's asser- 
tion that "the Civil War had barely grazed the 
frontier of Devonshire " is shown to be very 
far from the truth — thanks to a recently dis- 
covered and authoritative document relating to 
the Bloody Assize. No reign in English his- 
tory lends itself to illustration as does that of 
Charles II., with its galaxy of court beauties 
and its array of gay cavaliers, so pleasingly 
depicted by Lely, Kneller, Riley, Wissing, and 
others. These portraits are here generously 
reproduced in photogravure, and many views of 
historic places added. Indeed, so attractive 
are the pictures that we fear they excel the text 
in interest. The dramatic side of the Duke's 
career might have been turned to better ac- 
count. The treatment of the theme is scholarly, 
but the reader does not turn the leaves with 
bated breath to see what is coming next. How- 
ever, if we cannot have both true history and 
charm of style, let us by all means have the 
former. Percy F. Bicknell. 



Three Dante Books.* 



The Rev. Charles Allen Dinsmore is the 
author of an earnest and thoughtful study of 
*' The Teachings of Dante," a book which em- 
phasizes the fact that Dante stands in a vital 
relation to the needs of our modern age, that 
his teachings have lost nothing of their essen- 
tial meaning with the lapse of the centuries. 
The author tells us how, one summer day, 
several years ago, he picked up Longfellow's 
translation of the " Inferno " to take into the 
woods for an hour's quiet reading. He tells 
us how the spell of the divine poet straightway 
fell upon him, and has ever since remained as 
irresistible as the law of gravitation. He tells 
us, furthermore, how peculiarly the " Divine

Comedy " satisfies our spiritual thirst, and 
girds " the mind with power by bringing it 
into the presence of exalted ideals, intensest 
passions, and elemental truths." His tribute 
to the sacred poem is so heartfelt and sincere 
that readers may profit by the study which he 
has made of it, although that study is the re- 
sult of sympathy rather than of scholarship. 
We can discern in the book not only the out- 
lines of Dante's own thought, but also some- 
thing of the process whereby the impact of his 
thought has heightened the ideals and broad- 
ened the outlook of his commentator. 

In form, this essay is a systematic study of 
the " Divine Comedy," prefaced by a chapter 
of biography, and another in which the general 
aspects of Dante's thought are considered. It 
is not as weighty a book as Symonds's " Intro- 
duction " or as Maria Rossetti's " Shadow of 
Dante," but it belongs with them in the class 
of books that furnish helpful systematic guid- 
ance for those who seek to follow the poet in 
his spiritual pilgrimage. Concerning the fit- 
ness of Dante's message for our own times the 
author says : 

•• Our greatest writers are not engrossed with the 
actions of men, as was Homer; they are not absorbed 
in delineating their passions, as was Shakespeare; but 
are turning their thoughts into the deeps of the soul to 
learn the meaning of life and the realities confronting 
it. For this mood, which so often plunges men into 
doubt, if not into despair, the triumphant faith of 
Dante offers a corrective, and this meets the deepest 
of our modern needs." 

Mr. Dinsmore writes throughout with enthu- 
siasm, and often with eloquence. He some- 
times says a very fine thing indeed, as in the 
following passage : 

" Only a mind of singular beauty could have con- 
ceived a Purgatory, not hot with sulphurous flames, but 
healing the wounded spirit with the light of the shim- 
mering sea, the glories of the morning, the perfume of 
flowers, the touch of angels, the living forms of art, 
and the sweet strains of music. Only a spirit of ma- 
jestic purity and love could have thought out a Heaven, 
unstained by one sensuous line, revealing glory upon 
glory until the ascending soul is lost in the splendor of 
incommuuicable truth and the ardor of unutterable 
love." 

When the Oxford " Divine Comedy," in 
Dr. Edward Moore's text, was published last 
year, a companion volume of notes was prom- 
ised for early issue. That volume, the work 
of the Rev. H. F. Tozer, has now appeared, 
and provides the student with an extremely 
satisfactory handbook for the elucidation of the 
text. It is a volume of over six hundred pages, 
into which an immense amount of information, 
philological, philosophical, and historical, has

been condensed. Collateral references are 
abundant, as well as references to the sources 
of Dante's facts and references. The discus- 
sion of conflicting interpretations has been 
avoided, " except in cases where the balance 
does not greatly preponderate in favour of any 
one of them." We could wish that something 
more of attention had been paid to the parallel- 
isms in which modern literature abounds, but, 
on the whole, we cannot find any serious fault 
with a work which offers so much material, and 
so effectively condenses it. Each of the Cartr 
tiche is prefaced by a brief note, and each Canto 
is provided with a prefatory argument. 

Among the holiday books of the present 
season, none is more attractive than the illus- 
trated edition of the " Vita Nuova," in Ros- 
setti's wonderful translation. Rossetti's text 
is given, and his own introduction. This is 
prefaced by an introduction written two years 
ago by his brother, Mr. W. M. Rossetti, and 
this in turn by an introduction prepared for the 
present edition by Mr. Fitz Roy Carrington. 
After all these introductions, the reader should 
surely find himself on good terms with both 
text and translator. Mr. Carrington 's intro- 
duction is chiefly concerned with the pictorial 
features of the volume. These consist of fifteen 
full-page plates, for which, strangely enough, 
no titles and no table of contents are provided. 
We are left to guess at the illustrations, unless 
we can identify them by reference to the preface. 
Fortunately, they are for the most part familiar, 
including Rossetti's paintings of " Dante's 
Dream " and " Beata Beatrix," besides eleven 
other studies, and adding, for good measure, 
a portrait based upon the death-mask and the 
Bargello portrait, reproduced in color. The 
book is beautifully printed and tastefully bound.

"Five Thocsaxd Facts and Fancies, " by Mr. 
William Henrj P. Phyfe, is one of those miscellaneoas 
handbooks of curious and out-of-the-way knowledge for

regalation cyclopedias. It may be best described by an 
extract from the title-page, where we read that its con- 
tents include "noteworthy historical events; civil, mili- 
tary, and religious institutions; scientific facts and 
tHeories; natural curiosities; famous buildings, monu- 
ments, statues, paintings, and other works of art and 
utility; celebrated literary productions; sobriquets and 
nicknames; literary pseudonyms; mythological and im- 
aginary characters; political and slang terms; deriva- 
tion of peculiar words and phrases; etc., etc." The 
editor's practice in preparing works of popular reference 
has taught him what is wanted in a work of this sort, 
and he has made a skilful selection of material. The

For several successive years, Lady DLlke — who 
was Miss Eoailia Frances Strong and the widow 
of the late Rev. Mark Pattison before her marriage 
to Sir Charles — has published valuable and author- 
itative works on French art in the eighteenth cen- 
tury. Her book on " French Painters " brought out 
in 1899, on " French Architects and Sculptors " in 
1900, and now on " French Decoration and Farni- 
tare in the XVIIIth Century " (Macmillan), attest 
a wealth of reading and investigation continued 
through many years and presently blossoming into 
fine quartos. If it be a desirable thing to own fine 
furniture, it is only less desirable to have at hand 
such a book as this, with its wealth of illustration 
and description. For Lady Dilke is an authority 
who will never be satisfied with less than the best, —

pensive, or even the most authentic, specimens of 
French or other furniture. " Even delicacies and 
graces of expression," she says in her preface, 
" finish of inlay, sharpness of carving and of chisel- 
ing, are worthless unless sustained by sense of style 
and respect for the laws of construction. . . Were 
it not for their influence the priceless trifles which 
the millionaire guards behind plate glass . . . 
would have no more title to honor, from an artistic 
point of view, than the wax-flowers which the thrifty 
mistress of a country inn protects from bouseflies 
with a glass shade. This is a hard saying, for 
alluring prettinesses of shining metal, gay china, 
and marvels of finish are readily appreciated by any 
who live in costly surroundings ; but the values of 
style and construction demand some sacrifice ; they 
can be recognized only by effort, patient attention, 
and cultivated habits of observation." What fol- 
lows is so varied in subject and so rich in treatment 
that little more than a hint can be given of the 
contents of the book. The first six chapters deal 
with the question of decoration — as a background 
for furniture, and so discriminated from architectural 
effect pure and simple ; the next two with tapestries, 
and the remaining five with furniture of all sorts. 
Every style and model has the necessary illustra- 
tions to eke out the descriptions of the letter-press, 
most of them half-tone reproductions of photo- 
graphs, but many in photogravure, and several score 
in number. The book can hardly be described by 
a smaller word than magnificent 

Artist, book4over, and cat-lover in one. Miss 
Agnes Repplier has given us in "The Fireside 
Sphinx" (Houghton) a most fascinating study of 
the cat, from the days when she lived out her nine 
pampered lives in an Egyptian temple, and, dying, 
was ceremoniously buried in a gilded mummy case, 
until now, when after long dark ages of persecution 
and neglect she has won back a trifle of her ancient 
honor and reigns once more the " little god " of 
hearth and home. Compared with the lives of her 
wild brothers of jungle and plain, the story of the

individaal domestic puss is likely to seem dall and 
spiritless ; for hers is a distinctly feminine genius, 
and her limited field of action, her love of chimney- 
corner ease, and her impenetrable reserve, combine 
to defeat her biographer. But it is her race history 
that Miss Repplier chronicles, thus securing novelty 
of treatment among present-day beast epics, as well 
as the largeness of interest which her little heroine's 
domesticity tended to preclude. In this series of 
delightful essays she deals with pussy's varying 
fortunes in different ages and climes, with the legends 
of her witchcraft rites and revels, the French and 
English estimates of her, and the treatment accorded 
her by art. Every chapter illustrates and elucidates 
the conception of the cat familiar to those of us 
who remember the previous essays upon " Agrip- 
pina" and " A Kitten." " God of Egypt, plaything 
of Rome," witch and friend of witches, delight of 
Th^ophile Gautier or Sir "Walter Scott, — puss is 
always for Miss Repplier " the little sphinx whose 
ways are gentle, whose heart is cold, whose char- 
acter is inscrutable." The present volume, then, 
will be welcomed by all lovers of the cat; and it 
will be welcomed, too, by all who appreciate Miss 
Repplier. This new volume from her hand is 
characterized by all the wealth of anecdote and 
allusion — the " curious and forgotten lore" — with 
which she is wont to surprise and delight her readers, 
and by all the vivacity and finish of which her style 
never fails. Miss Elizabeth Bonsall's charming and 
sympathetic illustrations deserve mention as adding 
a crowning touch to the reader's pleasure. 

A sumptuous work in two volumes, abundantly 
decorated without and within, is " Flowers from 
Persian Poets" (Crowell), edited by Mr. Nathan 
Haskell Dole and Miss Belle M. Walker. Persian 
designs in gold on the cover, a Persian design in the 
sacred green of Islam bordering each page, speci- 
mens of Persian calligraphy and photogravures 
of Persian scenery by way of illustrations, com- 
bine to give the book physical beauty beyond that 
of good paper and careful printing. For its con- 
tents, the whole field of Persian literature has been 
gone over and made to yield its choicest fruits. A 
searching general introduction leads up to Firdausi's 
'^ Sohrab," from the translation of James Atkinson. 
For Omar Khayyam, dependence has been placed 
on an anonymous rendering, accredited to E. A. 
Johnson. Then follow Nizami's " Laili and Maj- 
nnm," part of " The Masnavi," and many of the 
shorter poems of Jelalu-'Din, or Rumi, with the 
"Day and Night" of Essedi to close the first 
volume. The second contains the " Gulistan " or 
"Rose Garden" of Sa'di, and selections from his 
"Bustan," "A Persian Song," and several of the 
odes of Hafiz, and the " Yusuf and Zulaikha " of 
Jami. In every case critical and biographical notes 
precede the excerpts. Within the limits set, no 
better survey of Persian literature in verse has been 
given in English. 

The photogravure series of travel-books issued 
by Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co., which began 



with the United States, has now extended to Eu- 
rope ; and in the new volumes on London and 
Ireland will be found admirable souvenirs and re- 
minders of pleasant journeys abroad. " London, 
Historical and Social," by Mr. Claude de la Roche 
Francis, is in two duodecimo volumes, filled with 
photogravures from the best-known scenes in the 
world's metropolis, having a text which is amiably 
discursive, and contains abundant references to- 
authentic and traditional history for the better un- 
derstanding of the subject, with a wealth of anecdote 
to keep it sane and readable. To an American,, 
the evidences of age are the most to be envied of 
any of the cockney possessions ; and Mr. Francis 
is right in devoting so much of his space to the 
portrayal of ancient customs and buildings surviving^ 
into the present. The book begins with ^neas, 
and ends with an anticipatory description of the- 
coronation of Edward VII. It has a satisfactory 
index, and a list of Mayors of the city. It also has- 
an excellent map, is well printed, substantially 
bound, and is in every way a book worth keeping. — 
" Ireland, Historic and Picturesque " is by Mr^ 
Charles Johnston, and will serve as an unusually 
fair and discriminating history of the island from 
the earliest times. The ancient Celtic mythology 
is given in great detail, enough to make the book 
serviceable as a work of reference in this field. The 
attitude is fair, neither favoring the Saxon invader 
overmuch nor searching out the faults of the natives^ 
There is an abundance of description, and many 
photogravures to illustrate it. The great number 
of ruins depicted shows the effect of British oc- 
cupancy without need of further comment. The- 
book is in one volume, with an index and map^ 
uniform with the work just commented on. 

Mr. T. Gallon has shown something of the feeling 
of Dickens in his use of grotesque English char- 
acters, and this is more, rather than less, apparent 
in "The Man Who Knew Better: A Christmas 
Dream" (Appleton). The story is that of a hard- 
hearted man of business, a veritable Scrooge, com- 
placent and secure in his riches, and oblivious to alt 
interests of life save his own balance-sheet. But 
the years bring reversals, and, finally, through the 
chastening experience of poverty and starvation^ 
the "man who knew better " comes to a real knowl- 
edge of life — and of death, also. There are other 
characters in the book, not the least interesting of 
whom are Bob Judkin and his company of strolling, 
players. The effect of the story is brightened by 
the illustrations of Mr. Gordon Browne, which will- 
suffer but little in comparison with the work 
of Hablot Browne, his father, — the " Phiz " of 
pleasant memory. Author, artist, and publishers 
have combined to produce in "The Man Who- 
Knew Better " a book which reflects the true spirit 
of Christmas more thoroughly than any other title 
on our Holiday list.

teanx " (Patnam) from the same skilfal hand, and, 
like ita predecessor, embellished with numeroas 
beaatiful illastrations in half-tone and photo- 
gravure. Ten little romances have been taken 
from their setting in history, and g^ven a new place 
and added brilliancy here. The literary flavor of 
them all is marked ; the first story, for instance, 
being of the three Chateaax of Nantes, Amboise, 
and Blois, and based on the " Book of Hoars " of 
Charlotte d'Albret. Not a little of the spirit of 
the age, so well translated here in terms of modem 
English, is supplied by that extraordinary gentle- 
man, Pierre d' Amboise, Seigneur of Chaumont, 
who, in giving seventeen children to the world, 
several of them of consequence, aided the arts as 
something more than a mere patron of them. The 
text ranges from the later reign of Louis XI. to 
the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the illustra- 
tions consist of reproductions of historical paintings 
as well as actual photographs of the buildings de- 
scribed. Notes and a bibliography accompany the 
tales, but an index is lacking. 

With the revival of formal horticulture comes 
Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's "Old Time Gardens, 
a Book of the Sweet o' the Year " (Macmillan). 
This learned American antiquarian has found no 
more congenial subject than this, nor one which better 
justifies the wealth of illustration lavished upon it. 
It is with gardens " in the good old Colony days 
when we lived under the King " that Mrs. Earle is 
concerned, and she must have wandered much and 
far to have accumulated the wealth of material 
from which she builds her pleasant pages. New 
England and the Old Dominion join in her tale, 
and now and again she permits something from the 
loveliness of the present to intrude gracefully upon 
the ordered beauty of the past. One such thing is 
the description of a sun dial presented by Dr. Henry 
van Dyke to Mrs. Katrina Trask, upon which the 
reverend poet has caused to be inscribed two senti- 
ments which must be given here. On the face of 
the dial, running about its edge, is this : 
*' Hours fly. 
Flowers die, 
New Days, 
New Ways, 
1*888 by ; 
Love stays." 
While at the base of the gnomon may be read : 
"Time is 

Too Slow for those who Wwt, 

Too Swift for those who Fear, 

Too Long for those who Grieve, 

Too Short for those who Rejoice ; 

Bat for those who Love, 
Time is 
Eternity." 

Mrs. Earle remarks that, though for years a student 
of such lore, she knows nothing to match these '* ex- 
quisite dial legends." The volume, from its lovely 
cover to the ferny end-papers, abounds in kindliness 
and sunny serenity, — altogether a book to be loved. 
That youthful humorist of the . Pacific coast 
whose sad fate it is to be known first of all as the 



author and perpetrator of " The Purple Cow " has 
had his varied witticisms and drawings gathered 
into one volume with the title, " The Burgess Non- 
sense Book" (Stokes). Here one may read what 
serves as an antidote to that most famous quatrain : 

" Ah, Yes ! I Wrote the ' Purple Cow ' — 
I 'm Sorry, now, I Wrote it I 
Bat I can Tell yoa Anyhow, 
I '11 Kill you if you Quote it ! " 

But over among the "Poems of Patagonia" is 
another version, beginning, — 

" A Mayde there was, semely and meke enow ; 
She sate a-milken of a purpil Cowe," 

which seems to indicate, after all, a certain lingering 
pride in the achievement; the explanation being 
given that the color was due to " The Master's 
Mandement " that " His Kyne shall ete of nought 
but Yylet Flonres ! " Probably the best form of jus- 
tice that can be done the volume is to reproduce the 
title-page: "The Burgess Nonsense Book, Being 
a Complete Collection of the Humorous Master- 
pieces of Gelett Burgess, Esq., Sometime Exlitor of 
< The Lark,' ' Le Petit Journal des Ref us^es,' & 
' Enfant Terrible '; including the ' Purple Cow ' 
with Forty Odd Nonsense Quatrains, the ' Chewing 
Gum Man ' Epics, the ' Gerrish ' Ghost Stories, 
Poems of Patagonia, Curious Cartoons, Autobiog- 
raphies of Famous Croops, & a Myriad Impossi- 
bilities, adorned with less than a Million Heart- 
Rending Illustrations by the Author. The Whole 
forming a Book of Blissful Bosh for the Blasd; an 
Amusing Antidote to Modern Neurassthenia ; a 
Stimulating Spur to Thoughtlessness, & a Restful 
Recreation for the Super-Civilized, the Over- 
Educated, & the Hyper- Refined. Carefully Expur- 
gated of all Reason, Purpose, & Verisimilitude, by 
a Corps of Irresponsible Idiots. An Extrageneous 
Tome of Twaddle, an Infallible Cyclopsadia of Bal- 
derdash, Ferocious Fancies & Inconsequential Va- 
garies, Than Which Nothing Could be More So." 
It is not an evil innovation, permitting every author 
thus to furnish forth his own idea of his work ; the 
book itself is no small proof of Mr. Burgess's 
aphorism, " Nonsense is the Fourth Dimension of 
Literature." 

The re-discovery of our ancestors continues 
apace, though the latest work in this field of re- 
search is devoted to possible ancestresses. Miss 
Geraldine Brooks has prepared two handsome oc- 
tavo volumes, with photogravure illustrations by 
Messrs. Charles Copeland and H. A. Ogden, called, 
respectively, " Dames and Daughters of Colonial 
Days " and " Dames and Daughters of the Young 
Republic " (Crowell). " There may be, and there 
often is, indeed, a regard for ancestry which nour- 
ishes only a weak pride," Daniel Webster is per- 
mitted to say on the title-pages of both books. " But 
there is also," it is added, " a moral and philosoph- 
ical respect for our ancestors which elevates the 
character and improves the heart." Yet it seems 
to be generally true that the more desirable the 
ancestor the fewer the descendants ; and certainly

[Dec. 16, 



the respect for ancestors in this democracy of oars 
seenas to keep pace with a fine disregard of the prin- 
ciples many of them sought to inculcate. The colo- 
nial worthies discussed in the first book include Anne 
Hutchinson, Margaret Brent, Martha Washington, 
Abigail Adams, and Elizabeth Schuyler, among 
others ; and among those of the young Republic are 
Dolly Madison, Sarah Jay, Theodosia Burr, Patsy 
Jefferson, and Rachel Jackson. This shows a cath- 
olic taste, to say the least. Miss Brooks is happy 
in her manner, and the books, similarly bound and 
placed together in a box, are very attractive. 

" When winter snows begrey the air. We '11 think 
of summer bright and fair," — a sentiment which 
comes forcibly to mind on looking through the 
" Blue Grass and Rhododendron " of Mr. John 
Fox, Jr., issued in holiday attire by Messrs. Scrib- 
ner's Sons. The book has an alluring sub-title, 
too, — *' Out- Doors in Old Kentucky "; and all the 
promise of the letter-press is borne out by the 
numerous pictures by Mr. F. C. Yohn, many of them 
from photographs. Mr. Fox went roaming through 
his beloved mountains, and came upon those de- 
lightful survivals of a simpler age, the inhabitants 
thereof. He describes their life with the sym- 
pathetic comprehension which has given his tales 
and novels so worthy a place in our national liter- 
ature, and supplements his descriptions with wise 
comments of his own, — the twentieth century dis- 
coursing upon the eighteenth, so to speak. This is 
not the place for political discussion, but we are 
compelled to wonder at what Mr. Fox may mean 
by saying that the "anti-Goebel democracy" is 
" the best in every way." Observing men in the 
North have thought some of these "best" men 
fugitives from retributive justice, fleeing with murder 
on their hands. Even if discussion of this sort is 
ever profitable, it can hardly be at Christmas time. 

Several holiday seasons have accustomed us to 
look for some valuable gleanings from the various 
fields of human endeavor, by Miss Esther Singleton, 
among whose previous works " Turrets, Towers, and 
Temples " and " Great Pictures " will be pleasantly 
remembered. Excellent as these were, they are still 
inferior to hef new book, " Love in Literature and 
Art " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), which on its literary side 
is a celebration both of the tender passion and of 
that wider spirit which promises peace and good- 
will to man, and on the pictorial side a bringing to- 
gether in compact form of no less than thirty-two 
finely reproduced masterpieces fitted to her theme, 
from the hands of the greatest painters. The choice 
is catholic. Botticelli and Leslie, Rubens and Ros- 
setti, Corot and Alma Tadema, indicate in brief the 
range of art; while the literary classics of modern 
Europe have nearly all been laid under contribu- 
tion, with a few writers of the later Greek world 
added for good measure. Here can be found af- 
fectionate excerpts from the works of Theocritus 
and Bion, Lyly and Peele, Cervantes and Moli^re, 
Jonson and Shakespeare, Spenser and Marlowe, 
Fielding and Sterne, Goethe and de la Motte Fou- 



qu^, Frances Burney and Jane Austen, Balzac and 
Gautier, Dickens and Thackeray, Longfellow and 
Hawthorne, W. S. Gilbert and Austin Dobson, 
Lewis Carroll, Anthony Hope, and Rudyard Kip- 
ling. It will be a strange taste indeed that cannot 
find in all this range something worth the while ; 
and the whole book, carefully printed and tastefully 
bound, is one to be treasured. 

After thirty years, Mr. William Dean Howells 
has revised his " Italian Journeys " (Houghton) and 
it is now republished with admirably dainty illus- 
trations by Mr. Joseph Pennell. It is a thorough 
revision, too, done with painstaking care, sentence 
by sentence. A comparison of the new with the 
old edition, published first in 1872, is an exposition 
in little of the well-beloved author's intermediate 
life. Not the least valuable feature of the handsome 
book is the brief introduction which Mr. Howells 
has prepared for it. At the outset, he says, he re- 
turned a categorical refusal to the request for revis- 
ion and for a new preface. But having consented 
to one, the other followed as a matter of course. 
Then he goes on : " From time to time it seemed to 
me that I was aware of posing, of straining even, 
in some of my attitudes, and I had a sense of having 
put on more airs than I could handsomely carry, 
and of having at other times assumed an omnis- 
cience for which I can now find no reasonable 
grounds. So exacting is one at sixty-four — ." But 
there is no need to go further. When the book was 
written, in 1871, Mr. Howells was thirty-four years 
old. Now he is sixty-four years young. And that 
is why this new edition is so well worth cherishing — 
with the old one beside it on the shelf. 

The sumptuous edition of Gilbert White's " The 
Natural History of Selborne" published by Mr. 
John Lane some time ago is now issued in a smaller 
size in order to permit its sale at a lower price. 
The page is somewhat reduced, but the resulting 
duodecimo retains all the pictorial and typograph- 
ical beauty of the earlier edition. The late Grant 
Allen was the editor, and Mr. Edmund H. New 
provided a most alluring series of pictures, — birds 
at each chapter heading, and views of the places de- 
scribed interspersed through the book in appropriate 
places ; and the whole volume has been made a 
worthy memorial of the humble English country, 
clergyman whose little duties thoroughly done have 
given him an enduring fame which his most mag- 
nificent contemporary might envy. It is worth 
while noting that no part of the apparatus of a 
useful book has been sacrificed in making this a 
beautiful one, the copious index being a treasure in 
itself, just as the illustrations of birds are all drawn 
from life and are of scientific accuracy. 

There is no occasion for despairing of good 
stories as long as " Bob, Son of Battle " can sell 
itself to the extent of fifty-five thousand volumes 
and still warrant the Doubleday & McClure Co. 
in preparing a special holiday edition of this ad- 
mirable work of Mr. Alfred OUivant's. " The 
better I know men, the more I like dogs," said the

French cynic; but the growing realization of the 
great democracy which nature exhibits to us would 
have it read, "The better I know dogs and men, 
the more I like men and dogs." Even here, of 
course, Adam McAdam is not quite Bob, but then. 
Bob is not quite Adam. This edition has numerous 
illustrations from photographs of the scenes de- 
scribed, taken by Mr. A. RadclifPe Dugmore and re- 
produced in half-tone. They depict every stage of 
the tender tragedy, but the desire of the subject 
who sat for Adam to keep his physiognomy away 
from the stare of the camera's eye has not helped 
matters greatly ; the dog was here the better of the 
two. Certainly if we were going to be a dog we 
would be a colly. But we *d rather be a boy with 
Christmas coming. 

•' Historic Towns of the Western States " (Put- 
nam) is the new volume in the " American Historic 
Towns" series, following previous volumes on the 
New England and the Middle States, all under the 
general editorship of Mr. Lyman P. Powell. As 
in former instances, there is a general introduction, 
written in this case by Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites, 
preceding a series of local histories from the pens 
of representative residents of the several towns dis- 
cussed. In this book are dealt with, among other 
places, Cleveland, by Dr. Charles W. Thwing ; In- 
dianapolis, by Mr. Perry S. Heath ; Vincennes. by 
the late William Henry Smith ; Chicago, by Mr. 
Lyman J. Gage ; St. Loui?, by Mr. William Marion 
Reedy; Omaha, by Mr. Victor Rosewater; Santa 
F^, by Dr. Frederick W. Hodge ; San Francisco, by 
Mr. Edwin Markham ; and Los Angeles, by Miss 
Florence E. Winslow. Each city has its story thor- 
bughly illustrated, with pictures of historic spots, 
and of its principal buildings and monuments as 
they stand to-day. The book is not less useful than 
ornamental, much real learning being expended on 
the text, which is authoritative in every case. The 
volume is handsomely bound and boxed. 

It is a merry and a lovely book which Mrs. 
Evangeline Wilbour Blashfield has written and 
Mr. Edwin Harland Blashfield illustrated, with 
the title "Masques of Cupid" (Scribner). Four 
little one-act dramas make up the contents : " The 
Surprise Party " first, a thoroughly modern bit 
from polite society in an aspect rather less polite 
than usual ; " The Lesser Evil " next, in which 
Robert Louis Stevenson's '' The Sire de Mala- 
troit's Door " is utilized with Mrs. Stevenson's 
permission ; then a commingling of French and 
Americans in a French country house in 1880, 
with the title " The Honor of the Crdquy "; and, 
finally, "In Cleon's Garden," taking the reader 
back to Athens in the fifth century before Christ 
and to a Cleon we have long known. Pleasant as 
these little love comedies are, the pictures for them 
are no less charming — reproductions of delicate 
pencil drawings, many in number. The book, a 
large octavo, is one of the most graceful of the 
season's holiday books, and delightfully harmoni- 
ous in every detail. 



" The Lark Classics " (Doxey) have already made 
themselves known to lovers of bibelots, and their 
reissuance during the holiday season in the brightest 
and stoutest of full leather bindings makes them 
available as a superior sort of Christmas card, a 
function for which their reasonable price makes 
them especially fitted. There are eight volumes, 
consisting of the " Rubdiy^t " of Omar Khayyam 
in FitzGerald's translation, with additional poems 
by Messrs. Justin Huntly McCarthy, Porter Garnett, 
and others; the " Barrack- Room Ballads, Reces- 
sional, and Other Poems " of Mr. Rudyard Kipling 
in one volume, and the " Departmental Ditties, The 
Vampire, and Other Poems " in another ; Mr. 
Swinburne's '* Laus Veneris, and Other Poems," 
with an introduction by Mr. Howard V. Suther- 
land; Shakespeare's Sonnets, with initial letters by 
Mr. Porter Garnett ; Eric Mackay's *' Love Letters 
of a Violinist''; Mr. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's "Love 
Sonnets of Proteus "; and Richard Jefferies's " The 
Story of My Heart." Other volumes are announced 
in this admirable series, to be published soon. 

A famous spot in American history is depicted 
in " The Mohawk Valley : Its Legends and Its 
History" (Putnam) by Mr. W. Max Reid, with 
many illustrations from photographs taken by Mr. 
J. Arthur Maney. From Campbell's "Gertrude 
of Wyoming " to the recent novels of Messrs. 
Clinton Scollard and Robert W. Chambers, this 
storied country has had its place in literature, and 
Mr. Reid's book adds not a little to what has gone 
before it. The strange legend of the Indian city 
Norumbega, which the late John Fiske explained 
so satisfactorily, places the opening of the narra- 
tive before the beginnings of history, and the Five 
(or Six) Nations, most powerful and most imposing 
of aboriginal governments, lend it the interest of 
their checkered history. Jesuit mission fathers, 
French feudal chiefs of the new world, the soldiery 
of the two great nations of eighteenth-century 
Europe, and the final settlement of many years of 
conflict in the peaceful present, combine to aid Mr. 
Reid in a task of much magnitude. Historical 
scenes, buildings, and personages comprise the sub- 
jects of the threescore- and-ten pictures, completing 
a work undertaken with ambition and brought to a 
conclusion with success. 

It seems fair to say that Mr. John Kendrick 
Bangs was never funnier than in his latest book, 
which announces itself thus : " Mr. Munchausen, 
Being a True Account of some of the Recent Ad- 
ventures beyond the Styx of the late Hieronymus 
Carl Friedrich, sometime Baron Munchausen of 
Bordenwerder, as originally reported for the Sun- 
day £kiition of the Gehenna Gazette by its Special 
Interviewer the late Mr. Ananias, formerly of Jeru- 
salem, and now first transcribed from the columns 
of that Journal" (Noyes, Piatt & Co.). The book 
is enriched with many delicious drawings in color 
by Mr. Peter Newell, and is a happy caricature of 
a book which is itself a caricature. The opening, 
which informs a waiting world of tlie inaiuier in

which comuiunicatioQ was established between the 
author and the late Baron, is as good as anything 
to quote : " It was not, to begin with, a dark and 
dismal evening. The snow was not falling silently, 
clothing a sad and gloomy world in a mantle of 
white, and over the darkling moor a heavy mist was 
not rising, as is so frequently the case. There was 
no soul-stirring moaning of bitter winds through 
the leafless boughs ; so far as I am aware nothing 
soughed within twenty miles of my bailiwick ; and 
my dog, lying before a blazing log fire in my li- 
brary, did not give forth an occasional growl of ap- 
prehension," etc. 

Mr. Oliver Herford is indefatigable in the attempt 
to do all that one man may to cheer his fellows. 
"More Animals" (Scribner), with both rhymes and 
pictures by himself, is the latest offering to this 
end. If not exactly drawn from life, the beasts 
and birds show a lively naturalness which is rather 
enhanced than diminished by the still livelier 
rhymes. " The Do-do," for example, is commemor- 
ated thus : 

" This Pleasingf Bird, I grieve to own, 
Is now Extinct. His Soul has Flown 
To Parts Unknown, beyond the Styx, 
To Join the Archceopteryx. 
What Strange, Inexplicable Whim 
Of Fate, was it to Banish him ? 
When Every Day the numbers swell 
Of Creatures we could spare so well : 
Insects that Bite, and Snakes that Sting, 
And many another Noxious Thing. 
All these, my Child, had I my Say, 
Should be Extinct this very Day. 
Then I would send a Special Train 
To bring the Do-do back again." 

The last four pictures in this collection are devoted 
to that strange beast which a boy described recently 
as " half a dog tall and a dog-and-a-half long," the 
Dachshund, smaller space not serving to give his 
full dimensions. As a result, the book ends, more 
literally than most, with a " tail-piece." It is very 
good fooling indeed. 

A curious work, evidently a labor of love in an 
unsuspected field, is Mrs. Amelia Mott Gummere's 
"The Quaker, a Study in Costume" (Ferris & 
Leach). Going back to the origin of the placidly 
demure sect who so courageously set themselves 
apart from worldly influences, not only in thought 
but in word and apparel, Mrs. Gummere begins 
with a consideration of the Quaker coat, most 
prominent of the various habiliments that went to 
make up the " plain " dress, a part of the "pride of 
potential martyrdom." Chapters on the coat, the 
hat, beards, wigs, and bands by way of masculine 
attire, precede the section on the costume for 
women, closing with a consideration of the Quaker 
bonnet. Much curious learning will be found in 
the text, and the book has numerous illustrations, 
many of which are reproduced in photogravure, 
making it an appropriate gift for all of Quaker 
descent. 

A series of the best meditative writings of the 
ages, under the name of " The Cloister Library " 



(Dent-Macmillan), is to be welcomed. The first vol- 
ume, already published, is made up from the writings 
of Sir Arthur Helps, containing " Thoughts in the 
Cloister and the Crowd " and " Companions of My 
Solitude." It will be followed shortly by a trans- 
lation of St. Teresa's "The Way of Perfection," 
showing the extensive range of the series. The 
books are beautifully printed on soft paper, bound 
in flexible cloth, with a cloistral cover design, and 
of a size and weight which will permit carrying 
in the pocket. A photogravure portrait of Helps 
serves to introduce the text, which should be too 
well known to require detailed description. 

An illustrated edition has been made of Mrs. 
Jane de Forest Shelton's " The Salt-Box House ; 
Eighteenth Century Life in a New England Vil- 
lage " (Baker & Taylor Co.). Mr. John Hen- 
derson Betts has provided most of the pictures, 
including full-page drawings of typical scenes of a 
distant day, as well as tail-pieces for some of the 
chapters. The frontispiece is from an old paint- 
ing showing the sort of habitation that went by the 
name of a " salt-box " house, with cabins for the 
negro slaves of its owner clustering at the back. 
The memory of many interesting things has been 
preserved in the text ; for example, the ancient 
name "winkum" for the cider brandy now known 
colloquially as apple-jack, the custom which re- 
quired the caller upon the young ladies of the 
household to take personal care of what was known 
as the " sparking fire," and the text of President 
Washington's first Thanksgiving Proclamation. 
Pains have been taken to verify the statements 
made from contemporaneous documents. 

That great novel without a hero, "Vanity Fair," 
appears in three handy little volumes as the fore- 
runner of a thirty-volume edition of Thackeray's 
works complete (Dent-Macmillan). A fine tinted 
photogravure of the author's best portrait serves as 
the frontispiece, and there are numerous illustra- 
tions in crayon and pen-and-ink by Mr. Charles E. 
Brock. A simple cover design, pretty end papers, 
and all that makes a tasteful book, round out the 
work with a fulness of excellence which the Dent 
imprint implies. 

Count Tolstoi's " Anna Karenlna " has attained 
the dignity of a sumptuous three-volume edition 
(Crowell), the translation by Mr. Nathan Haskell 
Dole being used for the purpose. Each of the 
volumes is provided with a photogravure frontis- 
piece after a wash-drawing by Mr. E. Boyd Smith. 
The type is large and clear (as may be seen from 
the fact that more than nine hundred pages are used 
to contain the text), the paper is good, and the 
cover design simple and effective ; these adorn- 
ments, with a rubricated title-page, combine to give 
one of the greatest of modern novels a setting worthy 
of its art. 

That expected collection of good things announced 
as " Miranda's Library " is favorably introduced 
by a gracefully designed volume reprinting Mrs. 
Jameson's " Shakespeare's Heroines " (Dent- 



1901.]

Dntton). The work is too well known to require 
any conament on the test, bat Mr. R. Anning Bell 
has been given free scope in the decorations, and 
the result is charming — suitable in every way to 
the fair creations of the master-poet. The frontis- 
piece and title-page are done in black and red, with 
a similar use of color for every chapter heading. 
In addition, numerous full-page illustrations contain 
portraits of the heroines themselves, done in line. 
Soft, firm paper, light in weight, and a cover design 
entirely in keeping, make up a gift worth giving 
and a volume worth keeping. 

Miss Marie Corelli has her cult, like other 
writers ; and a sacrifice on its shrine is the luxuri- 
ous edition of " Barabbas, a Dream of the World's 
Tragedy," just published by the J. B. Lippincott 
Co. There is a bit of symbolism in the rubrica- 
tion of its title-page, and Mr. Ludovico Marchetti 
has done half-a-dozen good drawings for the book, 
which are finely reproduced in photogravure. The 
binding is red, stamped with gold, — this also seem- 
ing to be somewhat symbolic. 

Following the holiday reprint of •' Penelope's 
English Experiences " last year, Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. now bring forth '' A Cathedral Court- 
ship " — like its predecessor, the delightful work 
of Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin Riggs. As before, 
Mr. Charles E. Brock has been selected for the 
delicate and interpretive line drawings which so 
plentifully illustrate the work, and not one element 
of the humor implied in '" a quantity of lemon 
squash suitable for two," and all the rest of the so 
thoroughly un-American things one finds in En- 
gland, has been lost. If these British did not take 
themselves so seriously, there would be a native 
verse on "lemon squash" which would out- Lear 
Lear. 

One of the little nooks of art is exploited with 
admirable results by Mr. Wilbur Macey Stone 
in " Some Children's Book Plates, an Essay in 
Little," published by the " Brothers of the Book," 
at Gouverneur, New York. It is the sort of 
thing that one is glad to see done by somebody, 
tiny as the subject is, and remote from modern 
ideas. The book has unquestioned charm, the 
essay being something more than an excuse for 
giving a series of illustrations. The book-plates, 
which are pasted in, give American, English, 
French, and German examples, some from a by- 
gone age with gaunt lettering and formal decora- 
tion and old-fashioned tyj)e designs for borders. 
Several are in color, and all show a firm grasp of 
the possibilities of the subject, from the little maid 
who is telling her troubles to a stalwart policeman 
with the motto " Take Me Home." to the plate of 
the Acorn Library, and its legend, " Small Plan- 
nings for Large Endings." The edition is limited 
to three hundred and fifty copies. 

That very pretty little story by Mr. Richard 
Harding Davis, '* Her First Appearance," has been 
taken from its companionship with the other " Van 
Bibber " tales and given a setting of its own. with 



the pictures by Messrs. C. D. Gibson and E. M. 
Ashe, made into vignettes with a tinted frame. 
The story deals, as its many admirers know, largely 
with the stage and stage people ; but the spirit of 
Christmas is reflected in its bright pages, which are 
made more bright by the tasteful adornments with 
which the publishers (Harpers) have distinguished 
this holiday edition. 

Calendars are among the inevitable consolations 
of one more year gone, and this season they are 
sufficiently beautiful in many cases to serve their 
purpose. The ** Bryn Mawr College Calendar for 
1902 '' is a pretty affair, and is to be had of the 
Students' Building Committee at Bryn Mawr, 
Pennsylvania, the profits from the sale of it to be 
applied to the fund for a new students' building. 
Thirteen full-page drawing^, reproduced in color 
on drab paper, will be found, done, as in previous 
years, by Misses Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth 
Shippen Green, and Ellen Wetherald Ahrens, from 
typical scenes in student life and from views in 
many places, both at Bryn Mawr and elsewhere. 
The work has decided artistic merit — " The Bird 
Calendar " (A. W. Mumford) utilizes six of the 
excellent color pictures which have been printed in 
the volume called " Birds and All Nature," the 
several months being represented by a winged 
creature more or less characteristic. The snowy 
owl, for example, answers for January and Febru- 
ary, and the red-headed woodpecker for July and 
August. In each case a description of the bird and 
an account of its habits accompanies the portrait, 
and the general effect is pleasing. — "A Calen- 
dar for Saints and Sinners " has been compiled by 
the Young Woman's Missionary Society of the First 
Methodist Episcopal Church, of Evanston, Illinois. 
It consists of fifty-two cards, tied together with silk 
cord and tassels, and bearing an attractive cover 
design in red and black. There is a selection in 
prose or verse for every day in the year, the 
authors represented ranging from Pythagoras to 
Will Carleton. 

Quite inimitable are the tiny volumes — diminu- 
tive enough to be literal •' waistcoat pocket books " 
— which the Oxford University Press is issuing in 
the " Oxford Miniature Editions." The latest of 
these is the ** Dramatic Lyrics and Romances, and 
Other Poems" of Robert Browning, with an early 
portrait for the frontispiece, and more than a hun- 
dred titles contained in eight hundred pages. Yet 
the book, for all it contains, is less than an inch 
thick, owing to the marvellous quality of India 
paper used. Both as a specimen of fine book- 
making, and for the standard value of its contents, 
the little volume should be a favorite with Christ- 
mas buyers. 

A series of rhymed skits on certain phases of 
modern American life may add to the hilarity of 
the Christmas occasion, many pictures in color 
framing the lines. The work is the product of the 
imaginative genius of Mr. Leon Lempert, Jr., and 
is put forth by the C. M. Clark Publishing Co.,

with the title, " Jank : Verses, Pathetic and Other- 
wise, Mostly Otherwise ; a Book to Stagger Sorrow.** 
It is dedicated by the " Instigator," with apologies, 
to the friends of his youth, and to others who have 
survived the ordeal and are still his friends. The 
volume may indeed stagger them, as it has almost 
staggered the critic. 

If anyone in the United States has not read Mr. 
Winston Churchill's " The Crisis," his last excuse 
for the singularity is taken from him by the new 
holiday edition which the Macmillan Company has 
just issued of this record-breaking novel. Enclosed 
in a box, with an extra board wrapper, may be 
found the neatly printed volume, bound in half- 
sheep with gilt lettering, and sides of buff buckram. 
Mr. Howard Chandler Christy's frontispiece has 
been moved over to face the table of contents, and 
its place is taken by a portrait of the author in 
photogravure with a facsimile signature. 

Mr. William B. Groos has phrased " One Hun- 
dred and Forty-Four New Epigrams," and Mr. 
Edwin J. Meeker has made a full-page picture 
appropriate to the sentiment he has hand-lettered 
below it, the book being published by Messrs. R. F. 
Fenno & Co. Mr. Groos has had better success 
with thinking his thoughts than with setting them 
into words. For example, " Life to the ignorant 
man is one long night through which he sleeps 
without awaking " seems verbose, and would be the 
better clad in the terser form, " Ignorance is sleep 
when it is not death," or *' Knowing nothing is be- 
ing nothing, in man or monkey." But Mr. Groos 
is writing the epigrams, not we ; and some of them 
are very good indeed, — " Law often becomes the 
tyrant of a republic," for instance. " If our wishes 
had wings how far we could fly " is one of the 
good things that was said for the epigrammatist 
some centuries before, however. 

Two more blossoms from Mr. John Lane's 
"Flowers of Parnassus " series are issued in time to 
serve as the best sort of Christmas or New Year's 
cards, — Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton's " Christmas 
at the Mermaid," with the pictures by Mr. Her- 
bert Cole ; and William Blake's " Songs of Inno- 
cence," illustrated by Miss Geraldine Morris, with 
a little of the spirit of the poet's own designs. 

There is always danger of the Christian Christ- 
mas sinking into the heathen Yule, or Saturnalia ; 
and this tendency is gently resisted by Mrs. Mar- 
garet E. Sangster in " Talks between Times," pub- 
lished by the American Tract Society. A photo- 
gravure portrait of the author is used for the 
frontispiece, most appropriately, the benevolence 
of the face it shows being admirably borne out by 
the kindliness of the little lectures on prayer, home, 
marriage, children, and other matters of daily life, 
including a timely word or two by way of "Yule 
Tide Musings." If we are to be Christians, it is 
well to be the kind that Mrs. Sangster is, with 
sympathy for everything in the world except vol- 
untary evil and its effects on the innocent. 



Books for the Young. 

II. 



Bookx 
for boys. 



Books designed more particularly for 
boys, including works based on history, 
begin with " A Boy in Early Virginia '* 
(Jacobs), by Mr. Edward Robins, with illustrations by 
Mr. John Henderson Betts. It opens on board the 
"Susan Constant" in Chesapeake Bay in the April of 
I607,a boy hero being there with the redoubtable warrior 
and explorer. It follows the fortunes of the two until 
the return to England in 1609, the Pocahontas incident 
being given due prominence. — Captain F. S. Brereton, 
R.A.M.C, writes "A Gallant Grenadier, a Tale of 
the Crimean War " (imported by Scribners), for which 
Mr. Walter Paget provides the illustrations. It is of 
the familiar type of historical books for growing boys; 
drums, bugles, daring deeds, death, and glory inter- 
spersing themselves through its exciting pages. — 
Harry Castlemon (Mr. Charles Arthur Fosdick) re- 
appears this season with "Winged Arrow*s Medicine; 
or, The Massacre at Fort Phil Kearney " (Saalfield), a 
book of the sort made well known by the author to the 
boys of a long generation ago. It shows no signs of 
decreasing ability to interest, on one hand, or of increas- 
ing literary perception on the other. The deeds de- 
scribed are matters of real history and mightily 
creditable to the soldiers engaged in them. — The 
fourth story on our list drawing from the recent out- 
break in China is Captain F. S. Brereton's " The Dragon 
of Pekin, a Tale of the Boxer Revolt" (imported by 
Scribners). An English youth of seventeen years is 
the hero, and he rivals the deeds done by the American 
boys in the American stories of the uprising — he could 
hardly hope to outdo them. — History made easy is the 
" American Boy's Life of William McKinley " (Lee & 
Shepard), from the ready pen of Mr. Edward Strate- 
meyer. There is not much excitement in the life story 
of the murdered President, at least not after the Civil 
War closed, but there is much to instruct, and this the 
author has made use of, adapting the politics of the 
book to the intelligence of his readers, and making 
the most of the anecdotes which have gathered about 
President McKinley's memory. — A pleasant and 
homely tale of country boys in the days before Prairie- 
ton had a railway is Mr. John Habbertou's " Some 
Boys' Doings*' (Jacobs), with illustrations by Mr. 
John Henderson Betts. It is more fact than fancy, 
and can be read with interest by many who were boys 
before the war between the States. — " Rescued by a 
Prince " (Saalfield) is Mr. Clement Eldridge*s account 
of a youngster who escapes multiform perils by field 
and flood, cannibals furnishing the chief excitement. It 
is really worth while getting into the most tremendous 
scrapes when they can be got out of so handily. The 

illustrations are uumerous The dedication of " The 

Billy Stories " (J. F. Taylor & Co.) " to every boy 
and girl in the United States who hates to go to 
bed when bed-time comes " ought to secure its accept- 
ance. For the rest, Miss Eva Lovett tells of a real 
boy, a healthy animal with a fine capacity for amusing 
himself. He begins as an author and ends as an arctic 
explorer, both occupations being carried on without 
leaving home. — Mr. Cleveland Moffett touches on a 
little-considered side of real life in his "Careers of 
Danger and Daring" (Century Co.), a somewhat mis- 
leading title, which is concerned with steeple-climbers, 
deep-sea divers, balloonists, pilots, bridge-builders,

firemen, dynamite workers, and others to whom excite- 
ment and daily bread spell much the same thing. The 
story of the wild-beast tamer is one of the best in a 
book that is useful, instructive, and undeniably full of 
healthy interest. 

A book or two having to do with Amer- 
^^ f**"." */ ican school-life may be commended for 
the real pleasure they give an older per- 
son in the reading as well as the transcripts from healthy 
boyish life which brings them home to the fellows of 
the boys they describe. Mr. Ralph Barbour has written 
his third book, " The Captain of the Crew " (Appleton), 
Like the two stories which preceded it, the well illus- 
trated volume is concerned with the boys at Hillton 
Academy. «« The Quarter Back," of two years ago, 
dealt with football matters ; and " For the Honor of 
the School," last year, with track athletics. So this, 
as its title indicates, has to do with success on the river, 
and the earlier sorrows and later triumphs of the cap- 
tain and his young English room-mate are set forth 
with a vigor and reality that leave little to be desired. — 
Of the same sort is Mr. Allen French's story " The 
Junior Cup " (Century Co.). The book opens in a 
summer camp where a lot of boys are having as good 
a time as health, leisure, youth, and irrespoasibility can 
unite in giving them. Two of them are enlisted as 
rivals for the prize which lends its name to the volume, 
and the wholesome emulation to which it gives rise is 
carried into the boarding school life which follows when 
the jolly vacation days are over. So successful is this 
book and the one just mentioned that others must follow 
iu the footsteps of Messrs. Barbour and Allen, to the 
lasting benefit of authors and readers alike. 

" When Mother Was a Little Girl " (Ja- 
cobs) is a title so good that we wonder 
at its not having been used before. The 
story is told by Miss Frances S. Brewster from incidents 
related by her own mother. The life described is the 
simple one of a Berkshire farmhouse. — The author 
of " Three Girls in a Flat," Miss Ethel F. Heddle, has 
written a book of the same interest, " An Original 
Girl" (imported by Seribners). The tale is of Lon- 
don, and the heroine is the daughter of a broken down 
actor, with a young mother who writes little stories, a 
beautiful girl who hates London, a sort of fairy god- 
mother, and various matters of interest. — A book of 
similar content is Mrs. Evelyn Everett-Green's " Miss 
Marjorie of Silvermead " (Jacobs), an English story for 
girls who are just becoming young women. But here 
the scenes are laid in the country for the most part. 
There are lords and ladies throughout, and love at the 

end of the book Another English book for girls is 

Miss Izola L. Forrester's " Rook's Nest " (Jacobs), a 
book for a younger set of people than the others. It 
describes a great deal of innocent fun and frolic, and all 
its troubles come right in the end. — A sweet little story 
is " Bernardo and Lanrette " (McClurg), the tale of a 
little boy and little girl in the Savoyard Alps, written 
by Miss Marguerite Bouvet and excellently illustrated 
by Miss Helen Maitland Armstrong. It is not without 
excitement, though uniformly sane, and it deserves 
reading. — «« The Colbum Prize" (J. F. Taylor & Co.) 
is a " story of girls for girls " as the sub-title announces, 
by Miss Gabrielle E. Jackson. It tells of two girl 
friends at school, each of whom, though healthily anxious 
to'win a prize, makes a sacrifice of her own ambitions 
for her fellow. — Miss Amy E. Blanchard writes and 
Miss Ida Waugh illustrates " Mistress May " (Jacobs),

the biography of a little girl who has illnesses and

sephine Scribner Gates of How, on a Certain June 
Morning, All of the Dolls in the Village of Cloverdale 
Came Alive, with Many Pictures Made at the Time by

title-page of a really clever tale for very little girls. 
The bringing to life and speech of all the children's 
puppets is told with a fine air of reality. — Romance 
and mystery clustering about a priceless ruby lends 
excitement to " The King's Rubies " (Coates), the story 
of a little girl. A boy or two, an old negro, some 
thieves, and other miscellaneous folk, give the book a 
large variety, and the action is incessant. It is written 
by Miss Adelaide Fuller Bell. — A tale of school-girl 
life in Washington, by Miss Armour Strong, has been 
given the appropriate title of "Dear Days" (Coates). 
The setting of the book on historical ground has given 
the author the opportunity to tell many authentic anec- 
dotes of statesmen and others, and the book is an ex- 
cellent one to place in the hands of growing girls. 

Fairies, goblins, and sprites are the most 
popular of imaginary beings, though 
modern fairy stories are like modern 
ballads: better technically, it may be, but lacking that 
indefinable something which is the soul of the whole 
matter. Precedence in this category belongs to " A 
Real Queen's Fairy Tales " (Davis & Co.), which have 
been translated by Miss Edith Hopkirk from the orig- 
inal by Elizabeth, Queen of Ronmania, and illustrated 
by Messrs. Harold Nelson and A. Garth Jones. Mr. 
George T. B. Davis provides an introduction, in which 
the life of " Carmen Sylva " is told, itself so near a tale 
of enchantment as to serve its purpose with rare fitness. 
The stories themselves are based upon ancient Rou- 
manian legends, and have in consequence an atmosphere 
and air (similar wurds of divergent significance) which 
are beyond mere imitation. They were written, we are 
told, in three weeks, in order to assist in raising a fund 
for the suffering Roumanian soldiers in the Russo- 
Turkish war of 1877; and the old traditions upon 
which they are based have been used many times in 
recent years, in such compilations as those of Mr. An- 
drew Lang, for example. The book is a desirable one, 
but it is the people long dead and forgotten, rather 
than the living monarch, to whom its interest is due. — 
Miss Carolyn Wells apparently is joining the ranks of 
the literary indefatigables, but without any appearance, 
so far, of being jaded. In " Folly in Fairyland " 
(Altemus) she has told a nnmber of stories merrily and 
well, even to the inclusion of an alphabet of limericks, 
of which one is, " H was a humorous Hen, W^ho couldn't 
count further than ten; So when she got through With 
the numbers she knew, She just began over ag^in." 
The pictures in the book are by Mr. W^allace Morgan. 
— E. Nesbit (Mrs. Hubert Bland) has told "Nine Un- 
likely Tales for Children" (Dntton), which are as 
" likely " tales (using the American instead of the 
British dialect) as any written for this year's children. 
The method lies chiefly in introducing the apparatus 
of a whimsical fairy-land into the practical affairs of 

every-day life In " Gobbo Bobo, the Two-Eyed 

Griffin" (Warne), Miss H. E<cott-Inman the author, 
and Miss E. A. Mason the illustrator, have seized upon 
London as it is to make something that is decidedly 
London as it isn't. These veracious chronicles hesw

with ««When the Clock Struck Thirteen" (which is 
very late at night indeed), and end in " The Wonderful 
Land of Zoologocady," which is north of day-after- 
to-morrow and south of day-before-yesterday. It is 
very good foolery. — Aborigines (of America and sev- 
eral other lauds) supply the material for Mrs. Jane 
Pentzer Myers's " Stories of Enchantment " (McClurg), 
for which Mrs. Harriet Roosevelt Richards has made 
the pictures. Telling of ancient things, the stories have 
simplicity; but this is sometimes forced. — Miss Kath- 
arine Pyle has both written and illustrated " As the 
Goose Flies" (Little, Brown, & Co.), which tells of five 
little pigs, seven little dwarfs, the magic lamp. Princess 
Goldeuhair, and a number of other unusual animals, 
persons, and things. The book and its pictures are ad- 
mirably suited to one another, and interesting to a 
degree. — Because it treats of some fairies, though the 
pictures are from photographs of really live boys and 
girls, Mrs. Elizabeth B. Brownell's "Dream Children " 
(Bowen-Merrill) may be included here. Mrs. Brownell 
is among the best known of those conscientious workers 
who are making a fine art of photography, and some of 
her most notable achievements in portraiture are used 
to supplement and interpret the letter-press of the book, 
which is drawn, both prose and poetry, from the most 
various sources. The introduction, by Miss Clara E. 
Laughlin, is a pleasant bit of writing. It must be said 
that, charming as the illustrations are in subject and 
treatment, the process of reproducing in half-tone has 
destroyed some of their most valuable characteristics, 
reducing to mechanical woodeuness much of the photog- 
rapher's best effort Quite as strange as any fairy 

story, and rather more improbable, are the adventures 
of the young electrician recounted by Mr. L. Frank 
Baumin"The Master Key" (Bowen-Merrill). The 
hero makes a small bracelet which serves all the pur- 
poses of the enchanted carpet of old, a garment which 
saves him from the possibility of bodily harm, a tube 
which paralyzes his foes for an hour when used against 
them, and so on. 

Favorite Amidst the immense output of books for 

authors in the day and hour, it still happens that 

new./orm. books of a generation ago, re-issued with 

the aid of modern pictorial resources, are often those 
which seem best worth attention. This is true especi- 
ally of such a work as Charles Kingsley's " The Heroes; 
or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children" (Russell), which 
comes this year with the sixty drawings, many of them 
in color, of Misses M. H. Squire and E. Mars. The 
old stories seem doubly hallowed by their association 
with the genius of the parson of Eversley, and the 

generous octavo is a possession to be treasured So 

of Charles and Mary Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," 
re-issued by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., with half a 
dozen color plates, and seventy half-tone illustrations in 
the text, by Mr. Walter Paget. '« What these tales 
have been to you in childhood," say the gentle pair, 
" that and much more it is my wish that the true plays 
of Shakespeare may prove to you in older years — 
enrichers of the fancy, strengtbeners of virtue, a witli- 
drawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts, a 
lesson of all sweet and honorable thoughts and actions, 
to teach you courtesy, benignity, generosity, humanity ; 
for of examples teaching these virtues, his pages<are 
full." Such words are as apples of gold in pictures of 
silver, and it would be well if no child's book were 
published which could not worthily bear such a senti- 
ment on its title-page "Ten Boys from Dickens"

as a substitute for the novels of the master himself. 

Her method is simple : Tiny Tim, or Traddles, or David 

Copperfield, or Pip, is made the central figure in as many 

narratives, whereby their biographies are extricated 

from all extraneous matter and re-told in Mrs. Sweet- 

ser's, not Dickens's, language. The work is certainly 

well done, and the portraits of the boys, by Mr. George 

Alfred Williams, are satisfactory; but are children not 

to be permitted to go to headquarters any more? There

Cat " (Jacobs) is written by Mrs. S. Louise Patterson 
for the purpose of making the same plea for kindness 
to cats that " Black Beauty " did for horses and " Beau- 
tiful Joe " for dogs. Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton has written 
the introduction, and photographs from life are re- 
produced for illustrations " In the Days of Audubon " 

(Appleton) is a simplified account in reasonable com- 
pass of the life of the great naturalist, written by Mr. 
Hezekiah Butterworth for the purpose of assisting the 
Audubon Societies in their work of justice and mercy. 
Nothing could be better calculated to teach kiuduess 
and courtesy to the feathered folk than the life history 
of " the Protector of Birds," and the book goes forth 
with the heartiest wishes for the success it abundantly 
deserves. — Mr. Edward B. Clark, already referred to, 
is also the author of " Bird Jingles " (Mumford), a 
series of pleasant little rhymes for children about the 
more notable birds, with colored plates of the same sort 
used in his other work, commented on above. — These 
same pictures serve also to brighten the "A B C of 
Birds" (Mumford) by Miss Mary Catherine Judd, and 
the merit of the book becomes doubly valuable through 
the authenticity of its bird portraits. The verses are 
called " nonsense rhymes " by their author, but they do 
not quite reach that level. — " Flower Legends for Chil- 
dren" (Longmans) are fanciful little tales from history 
and tradition, by Miss Hilda Murray, set in beautiful 

color plates by Mr. J. S. Eland Mr. Clifton Bingham's 

" The Animals' Picnic " (Dutton) is made up of humor- 
ous rhymes, and quite as humorous pictures by Mr. G. H. 
Thompson. It is not a nature-book exactly, but tliere 
is a great deal of nature in it of a human sort. 

This seems to be a day when text and 
pictures long linked in the public mind 
are being cruelly dissociated. " Non- 
sense Songs by Edwin Lear " used to have the author's 
pictures — not many in number, it is true, but with a 



Songi and 
jingles.

certaiu feeliug of cougruity which made them valuable. 
For this season's fine new edition (Warne) of a book 
which is now classic, Mr. L. Leslie Brooke has provided 
abundant illustrations in color, far better in point of art 
than Lear could ever hope to attain to, but still with 
the something lacking which was not lacking before. 
Bat the book is for children who do not know what 
their elders knew about the snbj«ct — and is it any of 
their elders' business, in any event? — "History in 
Rhymes and Jingles " (Saalfield) is a work of profes- 
sorial dignity, the text by Dr. Alexander Clarence 
Flick, who holds the chair of European history in the 
Syracuse University, and the pictures by Mr. Carl T. 
Hawley, B.P., who is the associate professor of drawing 
in the same institution. It is a most inclusive work, 
ranging from " Antony and Cleopatra," which opens 
thus: "O foolish Antony! Why do you stay? Do n't you 
know that Rome wants you? You should n't go away," to 
" The Battle of San Jacinto," which reads thus : " In 
the great battle of San Jacinto, See what a scrape the 
Mexicans got into, They fought it at a fearful cost. 
The state of Texas then they lost. In the battle of San 
Jacinto. [April 21, 1836.] " A little of that goes quite 
a distance. — " Songs of the Days and the Year for Chil- 
dren Old and Young " (Grafton Press) is quite another 
thing. In it Mrs. Harriet F. Blodgett, "thinking no 
innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised," in 
Dickens's phrase, has done some really graceful and 
beautiful little verses for the g^tification of any au- 
dience, however critical. It proves, though the proof 
should not be needed, that literary flavor need not be 
lacking in children's songs and verses, and we are sure 
the little folk will be the better for it. — As " cunning " 
little volumes as ever gave pleasure to a childish heart 
can be found in "The Bairn Books" (Dent-Dutton), 
written by Mr. Walter Copeland and illustrated in color 
by Mr. Charles Robinson. One of them is called " The 
Farm Book " and the other " A Book of Days." Both 
prose and verse are contained in them, and they would 
make an ideal present for twins — being small enough 
for Saint Nicholas to slip into a stocking " hung by the 
chimnev with care." 



XOTES. 



An " Introduction to Csesar," by Mr. M. L. Brittain, 
is a Latin book for beginners published by the American 
Book Co. 

" Carlyle's Essay on Burns," edited by Professor Cor- 
nelius Beach Bradley, is an English text just published 
by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. 

"Freshman English and Theme-Correctiug in Har- 
vard College," by Messrs. C. T. Copeland and H. M. 
Rideout, is published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 

" The Marble Faun," edited by Mrs. Annie Russell 
Marble, has been published by Messrs. Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co. as a volume of the " Riverside Literature 
Series." 

An abridgment of Jean de la Brute's "Mon Oncle et 
Mon Cur^," edited by Dr. T. F. Colin, is published for 
school use by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., who also send 
us Theodor Storm's " In St. Jiirgen," edited by Profes- 
sor Arthur S. Wright. 

The " Thornton " series of the Bronte writings, im- 
ported by the Messrs. Scribner, is now rounded out by 



a twelfth volume which reproduces Mrs. Gaskell's 
" Life of Charlotte Bronte." It is reprinted from the 
first edition, and edited, with introduction and notes, 
by Messrs. Temple Scott and B. W. Willett. There 
is a portrait frontispiece. 

Professor Ira Remsen's " College Text-Book of Chem- 
istry," just published by Messrs. Henry Holt &, Co., is 
a manual that occupies an intermediate position between 
the two other text-books by this writer. It is a Tolume 
of nearly seven hundred pages. 

Two of the pamphlet publications of Mr. David Nutt 
have recently reached us. In the Oriental series we 
have " The Babylonian and the Hebrew Genesis," by 
Dr. Heinrich Zimmern, and in the Romance series, 
" The Mabinogion," by Mr. Iver B. John. 

Two " Columbia University Germanic Studies " are 
"Ossian in Germany," by Dr. Rudolph Tombo ; and 
" The Influence of Old Norse Literature upon English 
Literature," by Mr. Conrad Hjalmar Nordby. The 
Macmillan Co. are the publishers of these monographs. 
Dr. James Harrington Boyd's "College Algebra,"' 
published by Messrs. Scott, Foresman, & Co., is a 
formidable text-book indeed, and we pity the luckless 
collegians who have to work their way through it. It 
is a book of nearly eight hundred exceptionally solid 
pages, fortified against hard usage by a substantial 
half morocco binding. 

The " Cambridge " Shelley, published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., is similar in form to the other 
" Cambridge " poets of this house, and is edited, as is 
entirely fitting, by Professor G. E. Woodberry. The 
" Victor and Cazire " volume is not included, although 
an account of its fortunes is given by the editor. There 
are nearly seven hundred pages in this edition. 

An " Elementary Zoology," by Professor Vernon L. 
Kellogg, is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It 
is a handsomely-illustrated work, well-equipped for 
class-room and laboratory use. The treatment is pri- 
marily systematic, but the ecological aspect of animal 
study also receives careful attention. We are not 
acquainted with a better book of its scope, and for its 
purposes. 

Professor Edward E. Hale, Jr., has prepared for 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. a volume of "Selections 
from Walter Pater " which promptly takes its place 
with the Arnold and the Newman in the same series. 
We have often commended these " English Readings," 
and this admirable addition to the series impels us to 
renew our words of praise for their competent and 
tasteful editing. 

A recent " Library Bulletin " of Columbia University 
is a bibliography of " Books on Education in the Libraries 
of Columbia University." The work has been prepared 
under the supervision of Mr. Charles Alexander Nelson, 
and fills over four hundred double-columned pages, 
the number of titles being 13,500. Columbiana are not 
included, nor are text-books ; since these categories 
would seem to be important enough to justify special 
catalogues. 

" A List of Serials in Public Libraries of Chicago 
and Evanston," corrected to the beginning of the pres- 
ent year, has been compiled by the Chicago Libhury 
Club, and makes a volume of nearly two hundred octavo 
pages. Fifteen libraries are included, and the serials 
catalogued reach the surprising number of 6640. Of 
this number, no less than 3755 are currently received 
in one or more of the libraries, and 2360 are in foreign

languages. No more eloquent testimony than these fig- 
ures could be offered in taking an account of the im- 
portance of periodical literature in the intellectual 
activity of the day. 

Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles has edited, and 
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. have published, " A Year 
Book of Famous Lyrics." There is a poem or two for 
every day of the year, all taken from English or Amer- 
ican sources. There are also sixteen portrait illustra- 
tions, a collection of notes, and all kinds of indexes. 
Mr. Knowles has a pretty taste in verse, and we can 
commend his anthology. 

" The Young Folks' Cyclopaedia of Literature and 
Art," by Mr. John Denison Champlin, is a third volume 
in his popular series of reference books for boys and 
girls. A notable deficiency in the earlier volumes, 
which dealt mainly with science and history, is thus 
supplied. The three books together would constitute 
the best sort of a gift for a young person of inquiring 
mind. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers. 

Among the recent publications of the United States 
Government is a work of the greatest value to the 
geographer and the historian. It is "A List of Maps 
of America in the Library of Congress," including all 
material of this sort in the national collection at the 
time when the new building was opened four years ago. 
The compilation has been made by Mr. P. Lee Phillips, 
and the volume extends to over eleven hundred large 
pages. 

Mr. Reginald Rankin's English version of the text 
of Wagner's " Nibelungen Ring " is now completed by 
the publication of the second volume. This work is a 
continuous poem in blank verse, rather than a simple 
translation, although the actual words of the text are 
used as far as possible. A great many descriptive and 
connecting passages, however, are necessarily original 
with Mr. Rankin. Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
are the publishers. 

The American Book Co. publish " A Brief French 
Course," by M. Antoine Muzzarelli. The work is a 
school text for beginners, having for its distinguishing 
feature the embodiment of the reformed syntax de- 
creed by the French government last March. In spite 
of governmental action, the new rules have not met 
with the approval of the best French scholars, and we 
cannot but regret their appearance in an American 
manual of the language. 

The Messrs. Seribner send us a revised edition of 
" The Evolution of Sex," by Messrs. Patrick Geddes 
and J. Arthur Thomson. The book is now twelve years 
old, and a restatement of the case seemed necessary, 
although the authors see no occasion to modify the 
essentials of their theory. The interesting confession 
is made, however, that in the past ten years the authors 
have " been diverging biologically — the one towards 
a Neo-Lamarckiau position, the other towards a Neo- 
Darwinian one." 

«* Government in State and Nation," by Professor 
J. A. James and A. H. Sanford, is a text-book for the 
use of secondary schools. It adopts the approved 
method of proceeding from local forms of government 
to the government of the nation. The book seems to be 
logical in its development, and historical in its treat- 
ment. The suggestions for independent work are well- 
considered, and there are abundant references to the 
sources of information. The work is published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons.

THE DIAL.

The End of an Era 

By JOHN S. WISE. Large crown 8vo, $2.00. 



7^ Outlook says: ''This is a work of compelling interest. It is a particularly charaiing aatobiography, 
bat it has greater value as a contribution to our knowledge of American history. Written from an ardently 
Southern and Confederate standpoint, and with a Southron's winning impulsiveness, it gfives to us Northerns real 
pictures of life as lived in the South from 1850 to the end of the Civil War. It gives as well to all readers what, 
perhaps, they do not find in more ambitious accounts of the war, namely, first-hand impressions of some of its 
distinguished participants. Notably valuable to read in connection with other accounts are Mr. Wise's descrip- 
tions of the Know-Nothing campaign, the John Brown raid, and the Merrimac-Monitor fight." 

Time and the Hour, Boston, remarks: "No book that has yet been written about the events preceding and 
during the Civil War from the Southern side deserves to be as enduring as ' The End of an Era,' and it is doubtful 
if any other book of the kind has been capable of accomplishing as much good in the way of restoring a harmony 
of national feeling."

Adventures in Tibet 

By WILLIAM CAREY and 
ANNIE R. TAYLOR 

" The Forbiddex Laxd " is a name that Tibet 
has borne. It has earned the name. Natural 
conditions and the disposition of the people war- 
ranted it. TVould-be explorers have felt the need 
of the best possible preparations, and even then 
have taken their lives in their hands. One English 
woman, Miss Annie R. Taylor, had the daring to 
set out with absurdly scanty equipment and a few 
untrustworthy servants to reach the jealously 
guarded heart of the land. Her own storj- of what 
befell her could not be other than stirring. Rev. 
WUliam Carey, a missionary in India, contributes 
the first part of the volume, where several chapters 
in his graphic and graceful style paint the back- 
ground for Miss Taylor's accotmt by describing the 
countrj', the people, their religion, and the venture- 
some traveller herself. The volume is ftilly illus- 
trated with 75 engravings. 

Cloth. Price, $1.50.

Room with its Orchestra," " The Throne-Room,"

of an American gentleman and a member of the French nobilitv through the historical chateaux

books of this kind. He gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the famous people 
who lived in them, and admirable descriptions of the countrv.

published a book entitled ' The Love of an Uncrowned Queen,' which for pure passion and 
genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest the fictitious and artificial * letters ' 
said to be the work of Mr. Laurence Housman. Nothing could be more significant of the 
tyrannv of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane 
regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over 'An English-

The Life of the Master 

By Rev. Dr. JOHN WATSON (Ian Maclaren) 
In its Second Edition. 

|\JO author is more ideally fitted for this work. Dr. Watson is a great writer and a great 
^ preacher, who has practically spent his life studying his subject. His "Life of the 
Master" shows that he is also a man with a broad mind and a sympathetic heart. 

The book is an art treasure. The artist, Corwin Knapp Linson, went to Palestine 
especially to prepare the illustrations. He spent over two years in the Holy Land, following 
in the footsteps of Christ, and studying the scenes in which he liyed. His sixteen most 
important paintings are here reproduced in color from plates made by Angerer and Goschl of 
Vienna, the most eminent color reproducers in the world.

of narrative description, humor, and sympathy for nature which fit it to become a classic of 
our literature, it is now rescued from ill-deserved obscurity and presented for the first time in 
fitting dress. 

Illustrated with eight plates etched by A. M. McLellan and colored by hand for each

Songs of Nature

nature as their inspiration, — poems which 
combine beauty with two qualities too often 
neglected — truth and simplic ity. A selection 
made by one who enjoys such a standing as a 
naturalist and poet will, we believe, be wel- 
comed by every lover of English poetry and 
every nature lover.

A NEW MASTER IN LITERATURE: 

GEORGE DOUGLAS, Author of 

The House with the Green Shutters 

IS NOT this the most important contribution to Literature this year r 
The London TtTnes says : " Worthy of the hand that wrote ' The Weir of Hermiston/ " 
and further on, " Balzac and Flaubert, had they been Scotch, would have written such a book." 

The Spectator says : " His masters are Zola and Balzac, but there are few traces of the 
novice and none of the imitator. It is a novel of engrossing interest and remarkable power." 

" If not a work of genius, it is something so like genius that we know no other name by 
which to qualify it," says Vanity Fa'tr^ London. 

*' It may be said to rank with the most terrible tragedies of Hardy." — Louisville Post. 

" It moves to its end with all the terrible unity of an Aeschylean tragedy." — Vanity Fair. 

Here^ then^ is a new writer whose work recalls to the best critics that of the masters^ of 
JESCHTLUS, BALZAC, FLAUBERT, STEVENSON, ZOLA, and HARDY.

Says Charles Warren Stoddard in the New Tork Tribune : " It is an admirable
