THE JAUNDICED EYE. 

It has long been the fashion for writers of our 
English race, from the vantage-ground of a 
conservatism assumed (without very close in- 
quiry) as our peculiar birthright, to speak in 
slighting or scornful terms of the fickleness of 
the multitude as exemplified in the history of 
other peoples. Ancient Athenians and modern 
Frenchmen have served alike to point the moral, 
and the study of their history gives repeated 
warning of the dangers that flow from instability 
of purpose. It is only the firmly-anchored char- 
acter that may withstand the tempests of passion. 



and hold to its moorings despite the angry onset 
of winds and waves. There is much, indeed, in 
the recorded experience of both England and 
America to warrant our complacency in this 
respect, and we have achieved many victories of 
civilization in peaceful ways when a more tur- 
bident stock would have thought bloodshed the 
necessary accompaniment and consecration. 

But a nation, no less than an individual, has 
a character that is subject to modifications, and 
these modifications, insensible in their daily or 
yearly effect, may in time come to acquire a 
cumulative impetus that will prove formidable, 
and will threaten what have hitherto been 
thought to be the very bulwarks of the nation's 
life. Principles and ideals that have stood in 
seeming integrity for generations may succumb 
to corrosive influences that have been working 
upon them in silence and concealment until the 
column has become a shell and the corner-stone 
a honeycomb. We had some startling revela- 
tions in this sense a few years ago, when we 
discovered that the Declaration of Independence 
was to be held as naught in the presence of the 
opportunity to subjugate a foreign people, and 
that the Monroe Doctrine had suffered a sea- 
change, being transformed from a statement of 
mutual international obligations into an arrogant 
pronouncement of national selfishness. With 
these and other developments of recent years in 
mind, we may hardly lay to our soids the flat- 
tering unction that we are immune to the 
temptations that lead other nations into the 
paths of vainglorious folly. 

Colonel Higginson once informed us that 
the possession of an added drop of nervous 
fluid marked our national differentiation from 
the parent stock, and made us a superior people. 
We may admit the added element without being 
altogether sure that its physiological action is 
for good. There are some indications, in fact, 
that it makes for instability and bad temper 
and irrational conduct. If we are lacking in 
the power to see life steadily and see it whole, 
to that extent we become prone to prejudice and 
deaf to the counsels of sobriety. And grave 
problems are pressing upon us, quite as grave 
as any we have faced in the past, which demand 
for their solution the unprejudiced outlook and 
the sober judgment. We are called upon to

grapple with corruption in business and politics, 
with social injustice, and with the ethical an- 
archy that attends the breaking up of outworn 
religious systems. To work regeneration in 
these departments of activity is our twentieth- 
century task, and it is as big a task as we have 
ever been called upon to undertake. Our chief 
danger will be found in the spirit of recklessness, 
for the eagerness of unbalanced reformers for 
immediate residts is likely to destroy the good 
with the bad, and to set back our civilization in 
the very name of progress. 

A foreigner who should judge us by our news- 
papers, and especially by such of our newspapers 
as have the largest circidation, would be bound 
to set us down as one of the most emotional of 
peoples in our dealings with the graver issues 
of life. The success of those journals is so 
clearly due to their sensational appeal, their 
cheap sentimentalism, and their flattery of the 
mob, that it becomes pertinent to ask if they 
have not gauged their public with a fair degree 
of discernment. This impression finds further 
emphasis in the very marked recent tendency 
of our weekly and monthly periodicals to aban- 
don their old-time traditional dignity and copy 
the sensation-mongering methods of the daily 
press. And when we find the novelists marking 
out their course upon the same lines, we may 
feel pretty sure that a new social force is at 
work, likely in the long run to have very con- 
siderable consequences. 

It is of the novelists that we wish particularly 
to speak, for so many of them have turned 
tractarian of late that the most fetching title is 
nowadays more likely than not to label some 
social nostrum or other, or to return an indict- 
ment of some phase of our national life, or to 
preach, with hardly an effort to disguise it, some 
new doctrinaire gospel. An excellent example 
is Mr. Herbert Quick's " The Broken Lance," 
which keeps within the lines of legitimate fiction 
until the reader is fairly committed, and then 
becomes an exhibition of the peculiar form of 
monomania known to readers of single-tax liter- 
ature. The adoption of a new form of taxation 
is to prove the panacea for all the ills of society ; 
and those ills, of course, are skilf idly aggravated 
to make the application of the remedy seem the 
more urgent. Another illustration is found in 
" The Convert," by Miss Elizabeth Robins, who 
finds the primal source of all wrong (as far as 
women is concerned) in the fact that the strong 
and selfish sex insists upon keeping political 
rights within its own control. 

The exploitation of dishonesty in business 



and financial affairs (with the strong implication 
that nothing but dishonesty is to be found in 
those quarters) has now for several years been 
a favorite theme of the novelists, who explain 
the inner workings of bank and railway and 
insurance corporations, of market manipulators, 
and of industrial establishments, with a thorough- 
ness that quite convinces the average reader that 
the real thing is under his observation. It is 
particularly noble of these novelists thus to waste 
themselves upon precept when they might be 
enjoyed in practice, for even the profits accruing 
from a " best seller " are trifling in comparison 
with the profits of the enterprises under their con- 
sideration, and it is quite evident that commercial 
success would be in their grasp if only they cared 
to reach for it. No one so familiar with the ways 
of thievery could fail to hold his own in the game 
of wits which these writers assume all business 
to be. 

Political corruption is another hard-worked 
theme of these reformers by example. Their 
method, with slight variations, is to show us the 
successful politician surrounded by his hench- 
men, and, by means of intimidation or bribery, 
holding the public in the hollow of his hand. 
When this picture is drawn in detail, the modern 
David appears upon the scene, and the pebble 
from his sling does the rest. Goliath is laid 
low, and the situation receives peculiar piquancy 
if he has a daughter whom David loves. The 
federal judge (who is in reality the most inde- 
pendent official in our entire system) is a favor- 
ite victim of the sort of novel now in question, 
and the villainy which his mask of dignity con- 
ceals is relentlessly exposed. 

All this muck-raking has two unfortunate 
consequences. It presents as a whole a picture 
of our national life that is absolutely untypical, 
however exactly an occasional instance may 
exemplify it. The foreign observer, reading of 
this welter of corruption and crime in which 
our novelists so delightedly plimge us, get an 
impression as false as that which we, for exam- 
ple, get of French life from the study of modem 
French fiction. Taking a more practical view 
of this consequence, it may be remarked that 
the foreigner, reading a lurid account of our 
meat-packing industry, renounces our steaks 
and sausages; reading of our insurance "graft- 
ers," he cancels his policies in American com- 
panies; and reading of our piratical railway 
fmanciers, he dumps his stocks on the market. 
The other consequence, and the more serious 
of the two, is that the novelists who thus lend 
themselves to sensationalism are deliberately

putting themselves into alliance with the yellow 
journalism which is our chief national disgrace, 
and are fomenting the evil passions of greed and 
envy which already show ominous signs of 
breaking bounds and sweeping away the old 
landmarks of law and justice. 

If we cannot exhibit more restraint, even in 
our popular literature, than we have shown of 
late, we may as well give up our pretension of 
superior national poise and sobriety. Impulse 
and recklessness could not much further go 
than we have already allowed them to go in the 
late onslaught upon our social system. Under 
the specious plea of attacking privilege, funda- 
mental right is being assailed on every hand, to 
say nothing of the many special assaults upon 
individualism. The tyranny of the majority, 
of which Herbert Spencer made such dire 
prophecies, gets worse and worse, and every ex- 
tension of this despotism is made in the name 
of philanthropy. But, as Ibsen said, and 
Emerson long before him, all these things 
* aimed at by half-educated reformers are the 
merest externals, and could accomplish, even 
were they turned in the right direction, no real 
regeneration. " I do not wish to remove from 
my present prison to a prison a little larger," 
said Emerson, " I wish to break all prisons." 
There is nothing that we more need as a nation 
than a stout reaffirmation of the first principles 
of individualism, a substitution of clear vision 
for the present jaundiced gaze of too many 
among us, and a new realization of the fact 
that reforms made by precipitation or violence 
are apt to cost more than they are worth. 



THE T WO W ORLDS. 

Has anyone ever made a census of the beings born 
of words — counted the population of that kingdom 
of the imagination which hovers above our heads in 
air, or invisibly occupies the spaces of the earth ? 
A " Who's Who " of the gods and godesses, heroes 
and heroines, villains and merrymen of literatme, 
would be a huge affair. All the Mythological 
Dictionaries, all the lists of folk-lore creations, 
would have to be emptied into it. All the inhab- 
itants of Playland and Poemland and Novelland 
would have to be mustered and marshalled in its 
pages. To the ordinary well-read man, the world 
of fiction is like the sky on a clear night. A few 
thousand bright stars are visible, while countless 
others are unseen or show only in the congregated 
gleam of the Milky Way. 

One curious result of such an enumeration would 
be to reveal that in some directions the people of 
fancy overcount reality. It is safe to say that there 



are two thousand novels published and plays brought 
out in England every year. It is also reasonable 
to estimate that each one of these productions con- 
tains, on an average, two members of the nobility 
among its characters. This would be more than ten 
times the membership of the House of Lords. And 
as the Active creation of titles has been going on 
for generations, the actual holders of hereditary 
honors in England must have been overwritten 
many hundred times deep. England would have 
to be enlarged to the size of Africa, to hold all the 
estates the wizards of the pen have crowded into it. 
And the great poets, artists, soldiers, statesmen, and 
financiers who have been projected by the literary 
imagination would make a population for a consider- 
able city. The shining ones of life are the favorites 
of fiction, and every real personage of this kind 
must go attended by a crowd of airy phantoms of 
himself, whereas the average or less than average 
citizen has not one chance in ten thousand of being 
confronted by his ghost-like similar. 

It is impossible really to separate the creations of 
the Historical Muse from those of her more imagina- 
tive sisters. Clio wears the same clothes and uses the 
same instrument of expression as Melpomene or 
Erato. They all depend on words to convince or 
inspire mankind. We say, indeed, that history is 
true and literature is fiction ; but in the first place 
this is a large and unestablished claim ; and in the 
second place, literature, being as a rule wrought by 
the g^"eater hands, makes a deeper and more lasting 
impression on us. Achilles is more dazzlingly splen- 
did than Alexander; Trimalchio is more real than 
Tiberius. But the two forms of human record are 
everlastingly confused. Fiction deals largely with 
the personages and facts of history, and history 
borrows the interpretive and dramatic devices of lit- 
erature. Historic evidence, indeed, is hardly more 
than a jest. That certain incidents occurred and 
certain people lived in the past is sure; but the 
causes and details of those incidents and the motives 
and personalities of those actors are wrapped in 
obscurity and open to the interpretation of every 
new historian. 

Literature is defined as an imitation of life, and 
its world is usually conceived as a sort of a mirage 
of reality. In recent times, the nearer it can get 
to the prose and placidness of ordinary life, the 
better it is thought to succeed. But even in the 
hands of the most accomplished apostle of ennui, 
literature, by reason of its necessary concentration 
and selectiveness, is different from life. It is life 
reflected in the medium of a single artist's brain — 
colored by his moods, changed by his passions and 
prejudices, charged with the impressions of all he 
has learned of the past, imitative of the work of 
preceding artists. Books beget books, and char- 
acters create characters. The Poor Parson in 
Chaucer, Fielding's Parson Adams, the Vicar of 
Wakefield, My Uncle Toby, Dominie Sampson, and 
Mr. Pickwick are in lineal descent. No two writers 
give us the report of the same life in the same way.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



French life as depicted by Hugo and Dumas is a 
contradiction, a destroying contrast. The New 
England scenes of Hawthorne and of Mrs. Freeman 
are equally things apart. Literature surely depends 
more upon the author's gift of vision, his inner per- 
sonality, and his skill in language, than it does upon 
the raw materials of nature and humanity upon 
which he works. Real life, indeed, is hardly more 
than the peg upon which he hangs the draperies of 
his thought. 

It follows that the laws of real life are inappli- 
cable to literature. I do not mean by *' laws " the 
actual possibilities and certain consequences of human 
action, — though literature can transgress those also, 
— but the rules and conventions of good behavior. 
Spenser passes for a moral poet, but he draws the 
picture of a sensual paradise which if it could be 
realized in our midst would be shut up by the police. 
Sophocles is the most noble-minded of the Greeks, 
but in his (Edipus he tells a story so shocking that 
it could hardly be whispered about in ordinary con- 
versation. The peculiar sphere of literature, indeed, 
is the outrS, the violent, the exceptional, the unre- 
strained. It deals by preference with passions, 
vices, crimes, which we try to restrain in real life. 
And it pictures these in the most vivid way, isolating 
and toning up to them ; whereas in life they are so 
largely diluted with commonplace as to be hardly 
noticed. Of course, literature also deals with the 
noble and the virtuous side of life, and perhaps this 
side is the corrective of the other. But if it obeyed 
the laws we draw up to guide life, it would deal 
with good alone. Yet in the larger view I do not 
believe its exploitation of evil does any harm. An 
imaginative boy will go through a course of reading 
in English literature, — will follow the fortunes of 
the rakes and roues of Elizabethan and Restoration 
comedy, will take purses with Claude Duval and 
gallop the roads with Dick Turpin, — and come 
through the ordeal more pure and honest than an 
unlettered youth who has only known the expe- 
riences of practical life. The imaginative boy has 
common-sense. He does not take the apparitions of 
fancy for the solid appearances of the world. We 
all need stimulus and intoxication, and when we can 
get these things from literature we can largely dis- 
pense with them in life. The whole domain of 
fairy-tale, folk-lore, mythological legend, and outrS 
invention, is a play or game of mankind by which 
it tries to divert its mind from its cares and dul- 
nesses. It is a make-believe by which it seeks to 
impose on its own credulity an impossible ideal of 
its own power and achievements. 

Yet the action and reaction of life and literature 
are as sure as the tides. Sometimes life, by means 
of dsemonically gifted personages or overwhelmmg 
successions or combinations of events, draws litera- 
ture after it, — makes poets its slavish and usually 
insignificant copyists. Sometimes great figures, tre- 
mendous actions, are projected, "all made out of 
the Carver's brain," and influence men at once or 
perennially. Men like Pericles, or Augustus, or 



Louis XIV. impose themselves on literature, dictate 
the tastes and forms which the artists must follow. 
Women like Cleopatra, or Mary Queen of Scots, 
carry after them a still longer train of poet-worship- 
pers. Great events like the Persian War, the con- 
quests of Caesar, or the Crucifixion, employ the pens 
of multitudes. On the other hand, great embodi- 
ments of humanity risen from some unknown depth of 
dreaming thought — Job, Prometheus, Don Quixote, 
Hamlet, to name no others, — create action in their 
turn, become bone of the bone, flesh of the flesh of 
the world. Werther, a projection of Goethe's per- 
sonality, swept half Germany off its feet by its 
revolt and sentimentality. And it is impossible to 
say how much the spirit of Napoleon, and hence the 
fates of nations, was influenced by Macpherson's 
Ossian. Of course, if we accept the dictum, which 
is at the root of modern science and philosophy, 
that "there is nothing in the mind but what the 
senses put there," we must refer the creations of the 
mind back to experience, and so make literature and 
life one. But the dictum is not true. The eternal 
laws of thought are in the mind, and the germs of 
origination and difference. If this were not so, all 
minds would be pretty much alike ; for they all go 
through pretty much the same experience. 

Is literature, then, a creation? M. Rodin, the 
great French sculptor — I do not say realistic 
sculptor, for he is too universal for such a label — 
brushes the idea aside with the remark that " none 
but fools imagine we create." Is that so? There 
is M. Rodin's Balzac. Without denying its power, 
all opinion asserts that the statue is not like Balzac, 
or anybody else. For any resemblance to reality, 
M. Rodin might just as well have carved a chimera 
or a snark. If, then, a man produces something 
which was never in the world before, and which but 
for him would never have existed, is it not very 
near to our idea of creation ? Art springs from the 
marriage of experience and revery. It is true that if 
a man goes on copying and reproducing the work of 
past artists, his efforts will lack that freshness and 
newness which are the signs of creative work. But 
he will also lose this freshness and newness if he 
copies, without inspiration, the frail, dull figures of 
humanity. To my mind, M. Rodin's statues are the 
most ideal of modern times — - the ones most informed 
with thought, inspired beyond the semblance of life. 

I am disposed to think that the highest kind of 
creative intellect does not allow itself to be much dis- 
turbed by reality. The man himself may be pitch- 
forked into all kinds of action, but he does not take 
experience greedily or readily. A few forms or 
movements of life he seizes upon, and with these he 
retires into his cave, and, brooding over them — 
aerating them with his own imaginations, twisting 
and twining them into a thousand shapes — he 
finally produces the new thing which we recognize 
as the work of genius. Solitude is the prerequisite 
for all great work. It is only the warrior who sulks 
in his tent who can turn the tide of battle with a single 
shout. Charles Leoistabd Moore.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



An English Hall of Fame now threatens to cause 
as much discussion and fault-finding as has the similar 
temple to renown in this comitry. The dome of the 
re-decorated and recently re-opened British Museum 
reading-room is divided into twenty spaces, of which 
a clock occupies one, while to the nineteen others are 
assigned nineteen names — " the greatest and most 
representative in English literature " — chosen by the 
Museum trustees. The names raised to lasting honor 
in that stately dome are — Chaucer, Caxton, Tindale, 
Spenser, Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Locke, Addison, 
Swift, Pope, Gibbon, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, Carlyle, 
Macaulay, Tennyson, and Browning. Glaring omissions 
will at once be noted by everyone, but no two amended 
lists will exactly agree. In general, the exclusion of 
novelists will excite comment and criticism. Scott, to 
be sure, is snatched from oblivion; but only because he 
wrote some excellent poetry before he produced still 
better prose. The trustees regard fiction as " less import- 
ant than anj-^ other branch of literary art." Exemplary 
Britons ! Tindale and Locke and Addison are duly grate- 
ful: before a bench of judges more appreciative of the 
flower of imaginative literature their claims might have 
suffered. But even counting out Fielding, Dickens, and 
Thackeray, we note with some surprise and regret the 
absence of Goldsmith, Johnson, Burns, Shelley, and 
Keats, not to speak of Dryden, Bunyan, Burke, and 
Ruskin. Still, we are thankful, on the whole, that the 
responsibility of selecting the nineteen greatest names 
in English literature was not placed upon our shoulders.

Whittier relics at Haverhill were on exhibition 
in abimdance at the celebration there of his hundredth 
birthday ; but the most interesting display of Whittierana 
was at the public library, in the building that the poet 
himself helped to dedicate thirty-two years ago when 
he wrote for the occasion his now famihar poem, " The 
Library," which was set to music by B. J. Lang and sung 
at the dedicatory exercises. Except one private collec- 
tion, the Haverhill accumulation of Whittier books and 
manuscripts and other matter is probably the largest in 
existence. It contains more than three hundred items, 
including of course most of the editions of the poet's 
writings and (most valuable of all) a file of the " Haver- 
hill Gazette," to which Whittier contributed the greater 
number of his early poems, often under anassumed name. 
How many of his obscurely published poems have never 
been collected or even identified, no one can tell; but 
their number must be large. The entire collection at 
the Haverhill library, with its suggestion of much still 
imcoUected matter, impresses the observer with the 
modest Quaker poet's great and ready productivity. 
Verse must have been, indeed, from his very youth, the 
most natural medium of expression to this American 
poet. ... 

Genius in distress is always a moving spectacle — 
except, perhaps, when the sufferer comes knocking 
at our own door with a petition for relief. A story 
now current concerning the unfortunate poet Francis 
Thompson, whose death was recently reported from 
London, has elements of pathos and also a touch of the 
marvellous, the supernatural, and the ghostly. Prob- 
ably the tale has lost nothing in the telling, but it is 
said that poor Thompson, whose fortunes once reached 
so low an ebb that he even resorted to match-selling 
and to cab-calling at theatre doors to keep body and 



soul together, at last became so discouraged that he 
decided to end his wretched existence. Saving up his 
pitiful little earnings until he had enough money to buy 
a dose of laudanum, he retired with his precious pur- 
chase to his chosen hamit in C event Garden Market and 
proceeded to drink the poison; but he had taken only 
half when, according to his own account, his hand was 
arrested, and lo! Chatterton stood by his side dissuad- 
ing him from the rash deed. The would-be suicide 
gave heed, recalling how barely the other had missed 
the aid and comfort that were on their way to him even 
as he was drinking that fatal dose of arsenic and water 
in the attic chamber of No. 39 Brooke Street. And 
so, in Thompson's case, it proved that an editor who 
had published some of the poet's verses and wished to 
pay him, liad that very day succeeded in tracing him to 
the chemist's shop where the laudanum had been 
bought. The story, whether fact or fiction, makes one 
regret that its hero did not live to enjoy an honored old 
age, and also illustrates anew the old adage that it is 
always darkest just before dawn. 
... 

The perennial book-pilferer, a hardy perennial if 
there ever was one, continues to vex the authorities of 
open-shelf libraries. Our largest public library, that of 
Boston, loses somewhat over a thousand volumes yearly 
through theft — all the branch libraries being included 
in making up this total. But since some hundreds are 
annually returned as surreptitiously as they were bor- 
rowed, the final showing is less disheartening than are 
the figures published at the end of each year. Thus, 
of books reported missing at the central library, 240 
were unostentatiously replaced on the shelves in 1902, 
389 in 1903, 336 in 1904, 304 in 1905, and 251 in 1906. 
Moreover, there is some comfort in the official assurance 
"that the books taken are principally of the cheaper 
sort, that many of them are books taken by children, 
and that in numerous instances they are taken not 
primarily by theft, but through informal or irregular 
borrowing, in disregard of the proper rules relating to 
charging upon a library card. It is also clear, from 
our experience, that many books taken from the open 
shelves, no doubt with the intention of returning them, 
never are returned; probably being thrown aside or 
forgotten by the irresponsible persons who took them." 
The irregular borrowing of a book for purposes of 
reading or study is a venial offence compared with the 
taking of a rare edition to fill a gap in one's private 
collection, or with appropriating an expensive volume 
in order to raise money by its sale. 
... 

The popular patronage of public libraries 
appears to be fully twice as great in this country as in 
Great Britain — a gratifying testimonial to the practical 
efficiency of our highly-developed system of library 
management. Mr. J. Duff Brown has made a digest 
of the reports of three hundred public libraries in the 
United Kingdom ; and from this digest we learn that t)f 
the population supplied with free libraries only about 
six per cent have registered as borrowers, only two and 
one-half per cent visit the reading rooms, and the average 
number of books drawn annually by each borrower} is 
three. While no corresponding statistics of our own 
libraries are available, yet the figures published by 
several of them separately make a comparatively cred- 
itable showing. Thus, according to late reports, the 
number of registered borrowers in Boston is about thir- 
teen per cent, in Brooklyn about seventeen, in Queens-

borough and in Louisville the same, in Grand Rapids 
sixteen, in Bridgeport ten, while in some of the smaller 
commiuiities the percentage rises to forty and fifty. 
Even the lowest of these figures is far above the British 
average ; but after all it is to be regretted, and also to 
be wondered at, that it is not higher. If all who refused 
to avail themselves of their publie-hbrary privileges were 
to miite and to vote a suspension of the public appro- 
priation for library support, what a cloud of intellectual 
darkness would overspread the land ! 

An octogenarian Shakespeare scholar whom 
many will delight to honor with at least a silent tribute 
of admiration and good will as he enters on his ninth 
decade of useful years, is Dr. William J. Rolfe, of 
Cambridge — our Cambridge, the public library of which 
has just issued a forty-page bibliography of Rolfiana, 
if we may coin the word. In a chronological arrange- 
ment are given the books and other published writings 
of Dr. Rolfe, the articles written about him, and addi- 
tional miscellaneous matters. It is interesting to learn 
that this veteran of the pen began to write at fourteen, 
his first pieces being short reports for Lowell news- 
papers. From 1850 to 1868 be devoted the best of his 
energies to teaching. Cambridge has been his home 
since 1862, and for the last foi'ty years he has been 
mainly engaged in editorial and other hterary work, 
and in lecturing, holding for the last four years the 
presidency of the Emerson College of Oratory, in 
Boston. Best known to the general public as the editor 
of Shakespeare's plays in most handy and serviceable 
form, he enjoys among the learned the reputation of a 
leading Shakespeare scholar. " We camiot hold mor- 
tality's strong hand," but we can hope its touch may 
not for many a year be laid on that busy pen.

Mr. James's revision of his early novels is 
awaited with curiosity. The announcement that he was 
to re-write them so far as it should be found necessary 
in order to bring them into harmony with his later man- 
ner, w^as a rather extraordinary bit of literary news. 
The desirability of a uniform edition of his motley-clad 
works, with a preface from his own hand to each vol- 
ume, is felt by librarians and booksellers as well as by 
would-be private possessors of his complete writings; 
but not a few readers, recalling the simple charm of 
" Daisy Miller " and " Roderick Hudson," will cherish 
a hope that these and other early romances of his may 
not be retold in the maimer of " The Ambassadors " or 
« The Golden Bowl." " Who am I tliat I should tam- 
per with a classic ? " asked a young author when 
requested to revise a bit of his own work. There are 
those who would resent the re-clothing of " Daisy 
Miller " in more studied and elaborate dress very much 
as the yomig folk of all Christendom would cry out 
against any recasting of the tale of " Little Red Riding 
Hood." Let Mr. James respect the classics, even those 
from his own pen. ... 

Volunteer work in library inspection is pro- 
ducing good results in Massachusetts, that one State in 
the Union whose every town enjoys free-library privi- 
leges. The idea was conceived by Mr. Tillinghast, 
chairman of the public library commission, that a corps 
of volunteer, unpaid inspectors, men and women disin- 
terestedly desirous of improving the free libraries in 
their neighborhood, and possessed of the requisite 
qualifications for the work, would effect more for the 
cause than the same number of paid employees, and at 



the same time would save to the public a considerable 
sum that could better be spent in carrying mto effect 
such plans of enlargement and improvement as they 
might find reason to recommend. This work of inspec- 
tion, which is said to cost the State of Wisconsin about 
$15,000 a year, is now engaged in by fifteen or twenty 
efficient volunteers in Massachusetts, all bending their 
efforts to the same end and following the same general 
rules, with gratifying results already manifest. In 
further support of the new plan, it is said that visits of 
hired officials are not so cordially received by librarians 
as those of persons giving their time and thought solely 
for the good of the libraries.

A FAVORITE New England story-writer who, 
with Miss Sarah Orne Jewett and Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins 
Freeman, has the happy knack of presenting Yankee 
character and Yankee eccentricity in most lifelike guise, 
has recently passed one of the more important milestones 
set up along the road to remmd us of our mortality. 
Miss Alice Brown has no silly sensitiveness on the score 
of her age — there is convincing evidence to prove this — 
but let it here suffice that she has lived an aliquot part 
of a century, and we hope she may live the remaining 
part or parts, to continue to delight the world with the 
products of her fertile pen. In this hope the readers of 
" Rose MacLeod," her serial story now appearing in 
" The Atlantic," are surely with us. 

... 
Competition in book circulation among libraries 
is not always a laudable rivalry. It might, conceivably, 
lead very easily to the fostering of a sort of sham circu- 
lation; that is, attaches and friends of the library would 
find no difficulty in swelling the circulation statistics of 
an ambitious librarian by drawing books oftener and in 
greater numbers than their actual needs required. The 
Examining Committee of the Boston Public Library 
reports that competition in this matter among the branch 
libraries is too keen, and recommends that only the total 
circulation of all the branches be published. Emphasis 
ought really to be placed on the quality rather than the 
quantity of the reading. 

Portable reading-rooms are among the innovations 
recommended in the Boston Public Library's interesting 
" Fifty-fourth Annual Report." The city already has 
portable school-houses, and " travelling libraries " were 
long ago sent abroad on their beneficent journeys 
through the land; and now it is believed that portable 
reading-rooms " would prove serviceable in outlying and 
in tenement districts." This plan, the reverse of lead- 
ing the horse to the watering-trough, has much to com- 
mend it. The proposed structures, besides tending to 
counteract the allurements of drinking-saloons and other 
low resorts, would presumably serve as distributing 
stations of books for home use.

New editions of « Alice in Wonderland " are 
falling thick and fast from the press. From London 
alone word comes of five such issues — all due to the 
recent expiration of the 42-years copyright which the 
book has enjoyed under the law. Whether any healthy, 
normal child under the age of fifteen can see aught but 
foolishness in this delicious masterpiece, will never be 
positively determmed; but certain it is that fun-loving 
adults will always keep a warm place ui their hearts 
for Alice. She ought now to make hosts of new friends 
among the purchasers of inexpensive uncopyrighted 
books.

The IjEtters of a Witty Parsox.* 



In an early unpublished letter, Lowell de- 
clared that nature had originally intended him 
for the church, but that in mixing the ingre- 
dients she had added a little too much humor 
and so spoiled him for pulpit purposes. Dean 
Hole, of pleasant memory, famous in both his 
spoken and his written word for the merry 
humor that enlivened his utterances, appears to 
have let no consciousness of his own drollery 
deter him for one moment from donning the 
clerical robe. In him, however, it is rather the 
keenly-flashing wit than the subtly indescribable 
but never unrecognizable touch of humor that 
provokes one's mirth ; but, for that matter, per- 
haps the same could be said of Lowell. Be 
that as it may, the selection from the Dean's 
letters that Mr. Dewar has edited, with a brief 
memoir, contains some very enjoyable specimens 
of the writer's playful fancy, and gives us a 
charming sketch of him in undress to place 
beside the more formally finished portrait of the 
" Memories " and the " Little Tour in America " 
— though the likeness there shown conveys no 
suggestion of stiilness or ceremony. 

The friendship between the Dean and his 
present editor appears to have grown out of a 
common love of nature and an interest in flori- 
culture ; this is to be inferred from three letters 
addressed to Mr. Dewar and included in the 
volume. The prefatory memoir is so good that 
one wishes it were longer. Making no attempt 
to give a biography of the man, it touches lightly 
and gracefully, with illustrative anecdotes, on 
the more prominent traits of the Dean's char- 
axjter. His unfailing quickness of wit is seen 
in the following incident : 

" Once he called on Mr. George Allen at Sunnyside, 
Orpington, with some inquiry about Ruskin's work, 
* The Seven Lamps of Architecture,' which had lately 
been republished. As he left the hall, he struck smartly 
with his head a hanging lamp. The last thing that, as 
a rule, comes off a man's tongue in a case like this is a 
witty remark; but Hole instantly remarked with good 
humour, ' If I am not careful, there will only be Six 
Lamps left ! ' " 

In choosing the letters for publication, the 
editor has shown wisdom in picking with a spar- 
ing hand and also in not including letters merely 
because they were written to persons of distinc- 
tion. Hole was on the friendliest terms with 
all sorts and conditions of men, and his informal

Rochester. Edited, with a Memoir, by George A. B. Dewar.

letters to old-time country cronies are more 
characteristic and entertaining than his decanal 
epistles to " My dear Lord Bishop " or other 
dignitary of church or state. The letters have 
little value as "side-lights" to history, and 
seldom refer to any absorbing social or political 
question of the hour ; they touch not on any 
controversies between the various sections of the 
church, high and low, broad and narrow ; they 
are not tinged with the slightest shade of odium 
theologicum, though their writer was well known 
to have the courage of his convictions ; and they 
do not afford the briefest peep behind the scenes 
in church politics or polemics. All this is plainly 
stated at the outset, and if the editor may 
occasionally be charged with going to the other 
extreme in serving up matter that savors of the 
tasteless and trivial, he at least gives us a good 
picture of his author's unfailing lightness of 
heart and frolicsomeness of mood up to the very 
year, if not day and hour, of his death, — a cheer- 
ing example of " an old age serene and bright " 
that never outgrew the appeal of things inno- 
cently amusing. Something of the perennial 
boyishness of genius was his. " Quick, impid- 
sive, ready to kindle up, and as ready to forgive, 
with an imboimded relish for life and for its 
humours and sympathy with its light and shade 
— that was the boyishness of him, and it wielded 
its instrument in the quick-flashing wit which 
sometimes took form in anecdote, and sometimes 
flitted by in the turn of a phrase, or a lialf- 
noticed word." Thus was he described by a 
friend who knew him well. 

A letter to John Leech, written in 1859, 
soon after the appearance of " A Little Tour 
in Ireland," which Hole wrote and Leech illus- 
trated, is among those in lighter vein. The two 
men were affectionate friends, and upon Leech's 
early death the other wrote a memoir of the 
lamented artist. The letter begins : 

" I have received a cheque from Bradbury & Evans 
for £105, with an allusion to future favors. I have 
thanked them sincerely, but my chief thanks and theirs 
(as I told them) are due, of course, to you. For they 
know, and I know, and you know, and all the world 
knows, that ' A Little Tour in Ireland ' would in all 
probability have made a Little Ditto to the Trtmk- 
makers, had it not been illustrated by John Leech — 
Grod bless him. . , . And so, my friend, with the de- 
lightful document on ' Smith, Payne, & Smith ' before 
me, I see thro' the signature of ' Bradbury & Evans ' 
the name of John Leech, and to him I tender my most 
genuine gratitude." 

Hole's " Book about Roses," which was pub- 
lished in 1869, must be familiar to rose-lovers. 
In the following extract from a letter to the 
Rev. C. C. Ellison — whom his correspondent

salutes variously as " Dear Elli " and " My 
dear Charlie " and " Dear Old Charlie " — the 
" rosarian " speaks : 

" 1 am much pleased to hear of yom* good conduct, 
as one of my pupils, and of your obtaining a prize. 
Continue m the paths of virtue and industry, wheeling 
ft upon them large quantities of farm-yard manure to your 
rose-trees, and you must ultimately win the highest and 
most honourable of titles, the title of a good Rosarian. 
May the aphis of difficulty and the mildew of disap- 
pointment always disappear before the syringe of your 
assiduity and the sulphur of your perseverance." 

A story told by Dean Hole in Chicago, in the 
course of his American tour of a dozen years 
ago, will be recalled by the letter next quoted. 
Its subject is a dog with a taste for religious 
literature. The animal had invaded a young 
curate's study and devoured half his sermon, 
so that when the curate came to deliver it he 
found himself brought to a premature close, 
which he afterward apologized for to one of 
the churchwardens, whereupon the warden said : 
" I should be much obliged if you could get 
our Rector one of the breed." To a brother 
clergyman asking what happened to the dog 
after his strange meal, the Dean, a great dog- 
lover, replies : 

" You will be pleased to hear that when the dog had 
inwardly digested the sermon which he had torn, he 
turned over a new leaf. He had been sullen and 
morose, he became < a very jolly dog.' He had been 
selfish and exclusive in his manger, he generously gave 
it up to an aged poodle. He had been noisy and vulgar, 
he became a quiet, gentlemanly dog, he never growled 
again; and when he was bitten he always requested the 
cur who had torn his flesh to be so good, as a particular 
favour, to bite him again. He has established a Re- 
formatory in the Isle of Dogs, for perverse puppies, and 
an infirmary for Mangy Mastiffs in Houndsditch. He 
has won 26 medals from the Humane Society for res- 
cuing children who have fallen into the canal. He 
spends six days of the week in conducting his brothers 
and sisters, who have lost their ways, to the Dogs' 
Home, and it is a most touching sight to see him leading 
the blind to church from morning to night on Smidays." 

To his son Hugh, a young giant of six feet 
and five inches, who distinguished himself in 
various capacities during the recent war in South 
Africa, the clerical father writes in a tone of 
delightful comradeship. Here, for instance, is 
the opening of a letter of Oct. 6, 1897, which 
the editor leaves to explain itself : 

" I am delighted, my dear Son, with your very inter- 
esting letter, and I congratulate you heartily on your 
magnificent right and left in the pursuit of friendships, 
Nansen and Ibsen, two of the most famous men of their 
day. All must admire Nansen's heroism, and Ibsen's 
intellectual power ; and it does one good to be with such 
men, though m some points, in which they are not 
experts or students, we may have no sympathies. I 
anticipate a great enjoyment in hearing, viva voce, 
more details of yonr singular and exciting intercourse. 



We shall be ' Arcades ambo, et cantam [misprint for 
cantare] et respondere parati,' when we meet, seeing 
that we have been in half-a-score houses within the last 
3 months, and with all sorts and conditions of men." 

As a specimen of the Dean's more serious 
style — for he could be deeply serious and pro- 
foundly impressive when occasion demanded — 
let us quote a sentence from a letter wi-itten to 
the Bishop of Rochester three months before the 
writer's death. 

" As the Sun and the Showers have clothed our Kent 
Orchards with garments of praise, and made the buds 
of our garments to grow, so your words of warm and 
refreshing sympathy, from the comfort wherewith you 
are comforted of God, make my faith glad with the 
blossoms of hope, and quicken my prayers for those 
fruits of the Spirit, and those flowers of Eden, which 
will be restored in the new heaven and the new earth, 
where dwelleth Righteousness." 

A friend, quoted in the " Memoir," says of 
Dean Hole : " It is difficult to convey just that 
impression of ' distinction ' or nobleness which 
was exactly what no one could help receiving 
from his presence. But it would have been 
difficidt — and disagreeable — to bring any- 
thing mean, or unchivalrous, or unworthy, into 
his presence." These words may be fitly sup- 
plemented by Hole's definition of a gentleman ; 
it gives at least a glimpse of the ideal after 
which he had modelled his own character. 

" There is no such thing as a gentleman by birth. No 
public schools, no universities, no study of elegant 
literature, no intellectual attainments, no accomplish- 
ments, no titled playmates can confer the gift. The 
real elements, the truthfulness which cannot he, the 
uprightness which will not stoop, the courtesy which 
considers all, the honour which cannot be bribed, the 
command of the passions, the. mastery of the tem- 
per — these can only be learned from God." 

Some good pictures accompany the reading 
matter ; also an occasional pen-and-ink sketch 
by the Dean's own hand — so variously accom- 
plished was he. The frontispiece portrait of him 
and the view of the rosary at Caunton, with the 
vicar-gardener standing in its midst, are espe- 
cially pleasing. The only thing calling for a 
word of adverse criticism in the volume is the 
ungenial stiffness of its binding, which will far 
sooner break than bend its obstinate ba«k.

We noticed some weeks ago the posthumous collec- 
tion of the poems of George Henry Miles. Mention 
was made in that volume of " A Review of Hamlet " by 
the same author — a contribution to Shakespearian 
criticism that attracted much attention at the time when 
it was written, and that had a marked influence upon 
Edwin Booth in his interpretation of the Dane. The 
essay is now republished by Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co., and proves to be a subtle and keenly intelligent 
analysis of the great tragedy.

The Heart of Hamlet's Mystery.* 

Mr. Churton Collins has remarked that most 
attempts to pluck out the heart of Hamlet's 
mystery have thrown more light upon the char- 
acter of the interpreter than upon the subject. 
This no doubt explains the tendency of modem 
criticism to emphasize the subjective difficulties 
in the way of Hamlet's accomplishment of his 
task. We like to think of ourselves as dark- 
ened by a fine melancholy, or paralyzed by an 
austere intellectuality, or perplexed by a too 
exacting conscience. Like Coleridge, we are 
oppressed by the sense of our own impotence, 
and our criticism becomes an elegy of our 
thwarted purposes. Like Mr. Collins, we per- 
ceive in many of the finest types of modem 
civilization the taint of an immoral aestheticism, 
and our criticism becomes a warning against the 
immoderate worship of beauty. 

To this school of critics, the theory of Werder 
seems a paradox. The most psychological play 
of Shakespeare he interprets as a tragedy of 
circumstance. The most vacillating of heroes 
he declares to be the incarnation of steady 
purpose. The all but utter failure of Ham- 
let's mission he regards as a triumph of foresight. 
In the hero's tragic death he sees, not the 
result of thinking too precisely on the event, 
but the penalty of instinctive and ill-considered 
action. 

His theory was first expounded in a course of 
lectures at Berlin in 1859-60. Though it was 
conceived independently, it had been anticipated 
by J. L. Klein in 1846 and by George Fletcher 
in 1845. Dr. Fumess refers to it with approval 
in the Variorum Hamlet, and it has been 
accepted by Hudson and Rolfe. 

It is briefly this : Hamlet's problem is to 
avenge his father's murder, but so to avenge it 
as to make the justice of his act evident to all. 
The confession of Claudius, therefore, not his 
death, is the first necessity. To kill the King 
would be to kill the only proof of his crime. 
From this point of view the play becomes a 
struggle between Hamlet's instinctive and 
almost overmastering impulse to slay, and his 
deliberate conscientious self-restraint until he 
shall have forced the criminal to convict him- 
self. In the murder of Polonius, instinct tri- 
umphs over reason and conscience ; and hence 
arise all the evils of the latter part of the play — 
the madness of Ophelia, the death of the Queen, 
and the death of Hamlet himself. Nevertheless,

troduction by W. J. Rolfe. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



the poisoned cup and rapiers, the King's 
conspiracy with Laertes, are a confession ; and 
though Hamlet's lips are sealed by death, 
Horatio lives to tell his story and to heal his 
wounded name. It is this struggle that gives 
significance to Hamlet's self-reproaches. After 
the interview with the players, he is thinking 
of the contrast, not between the actor's passion 
and his own inertness, but between his thirst 
for revenge and the necessity of inaction. In 
the most famous of the soliloquies, the point of 
his reflection is that conscience, which in his 
bitterness he calls cowardice, keeps him from 
suicide as from vengeance. And in the com- 
ment on Fortinbras' venture, he is thinking of 
the prince's freedom to act and his own enforced 
delay. 

It is all plausible enough ; but then, so mani- 
fold is the suggestiveness of the play that almost 
any theory can be made plausible. For the same 
reason, there is no theory against which strong 
objections cannot be urged. Our wisest course 
is to adopt the theory that on the whole best 
represents our own experience with Hamlet, 
without too close attention to the objections that 
can be produced against it. 

Against Professor Werder's theory, as a 
whole, we have nothing to say, except that it 
does not represent our experience with Hamlet. 
Against details of it, there are some objections 
that are perhaps not idle. Like most students 
of the play, he makes far too little of its history, 
of the traditional material that is imbedded in 
it ; far too little, also, of Shakespeare's care- 
less acceptance of such material, with little or 
no effort to motivate it. Reflections of this 
sort should temper our deliverances upon the 
assumed madness, and our efforts to acquit 
Hamlet of blame for the death of his two school- 
fellows. Marvellous as the motivation of this 
play is, a motivation that we can see in process 
of development, there is a limit to it fixed by 
the dramatist's fatigue or lack of time. Hence, 
in part, the mystery of the play. 

As usual, the commentator seems to us to 
have forced his own interpretation upon certain 
passages in defiance of the plain sense. Hardly 
anything in the earlier scenes is more striking 
than Hamlet's physical revulsion from his 
mother's marriage, which, to an audience with 
centuries of Catholicism in their blood, would 
have seemed very like incest. Yet Professor 
Werder never refers to this, and explains the 
horror of the first soliloquy as due to a pre- 
sentiment of the murder. It is not true that 
" Hamlet breathes no word of complaint of hav- 



14

ing suffered " from Claudius' usurpation. No 
other interpretation is possible of 

" A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, 
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, 
And put it in his pocket " (3.4.99-101) ; 

and 

" Popp'd in between the election and my hopes" (5.2.65.) 

The Ghost, says Professor Werder, " does not 
blame Hamlet for his delay, as the critics have 
done "; and he quotes, in confirmation of his 
statement, — 

" Do not forg'et. This visitation 
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose " (3.4.110, 111.) 

The series of questions on page 69 is typical 
of the attitude of many students toward Shake- 
speare's "feigned histories." Why, Professor 
Werder asks, was the time out of joint ? Why 
were there no wise counsellors, no noble war- 
riors, at the court of Claudius ? Did the elder 
Hamlet outlive all the better element of his 
court ? and is this the reason why Claudius re- 
mained in undisputed possession of the throne ? 
Such questions are a tribute to the poet's power 
of creating an illusion, but they do not indicate 
a fruitful critical method. 

An interpretation of this kind, however 
plausible, seems to us to pluck out the heart of 
Hamlet's mystery indetid, to rob it of much of 
its stimulating and moving quality. If it is cor- 
rect, the play is less profound, less poignant, less 
modem than we have thought, and we have shed 
our tears in vain over the wreck of precious and 
splendid things that were not fitted to survive.

ENGiiASTD's American Provinces and 
HER Imperial. Control,.* 



The third volume of Professor Osgood's 
notable work, " The American Colonies in the 
Seventeenth Century," rounds out, after an 
interval of three years, that part of the classi- 
fication of the Colonies which the writer omitted 
from consideration in his first instalment of 
two volumes. A word is needed, perhaps, to 
remind one of this classification, in order that the 
purpose of the work may be fully understood. 
Instead of treating the Colonies from a purely 
chronological standpoint, or, on the other hand, 
taking up successively each Colony or group of 
Colonies in geographical order, ProiEessor Osgood 
has developed in earlier monographs and now 
in this extensive treatise the idea that the true 

* The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century.

Beginnings of the System of Royal Provinces. New York: 
The Macmillan Co. 



method of approach is to classify the Colonies 
according to their internal governmental struc- 
ture, and then to trace the development of each 
of the groups thus set apart. Following out this 
plan, Professor Osgood substitutes for the old 
simple division into Royal, Charter, and Pro- 
prietary Colonies, a more complex analysis into 
Corporate Colonies and Provinces, then divid- 
ing the latter class into Royal and Proprietary 
Provinces. In his earlier papers he showed the 
sharp distinction that must be observed between 
the structure of the Corporate Colony — exem- 
plified in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Mas- 
sachusetts before 1684 — and the Provinces ; 
and he furthermore maintained the essential 
oneness in principle of the Proprietary Province 
— whether the proprietor were an individual, 
a group of individuals, or a company — and the 
Royal Province. 

But parallel with the classification into 
Corporations and Provinces is another, which 
divides the Colonies into those which enjoyed 
the advantages of charters and those which did 
not : for Corporations and Proprietary Pro- 
vinces alike had charters, while Royal Provinces, 
except Massachusetts after 1691, had none. 
These two canons of division influence one 
another ; and in the two volumes first issued it 
was the Chartered Colonies, Corporations, and 
Proprietary Provinces that were compared. The 
field left to this third volume is consequently 
the Royal Province ; and thus Virginia after 
1624, the dissolution of the Massachusetts Bay 
Company, the beginnings of royal government 
in New Hampshire and New York, the admin- 
istration of Governor Andros in the Eastern 
Provinces, together with the revolutionary move- 
ments which in 1689 appeared in New York, 
in Massachusetts, and in Maryland, — these 
parts of Colonial history are developed with the 
same clearness and wealth of details that char- 
acterized the earlier portion of the work. The 
institutional life of the Royal Province is not 
treated under such separate heads as the Land 
System, the Official System, the Financial 
System, Ecclesiastical Relations, etc., as were 
used in the preceding volumes, but is developed 
along with the narrative. This is due, in aU 
probability, to the fact that only a small part of 
the life of the Royal Provinces other than 
Virginia lies within the limits of the period 
chosen by Professor Osgood, the seventeenth 
century. 

The gTcatest value of the present volume lies 
in its discussion of the imperial control of 
Ensland. The author begins with the thesis 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



16 



that the central fact in this connection is the 
process of transformation out of Chartered 
Colonies into Royal Provinces. He recalls that 
the problem of British administration was not 
one of race but merely of distance. Attempts 
to enlist the interest of Parliament were sum- 
marily checked, and control of the Colonies, so 
far as it was exercised at all, remained a func- 
tion of the executive government of England, 
assisted by the various councils and boards and 
minor agencies, of which Professor Osgood gives 
a most helpful account. The seventeenth cen- 
tury was the day of the Chartered Colony, 
feudal in its aspect, remote from the mother- 
country. It was the Restoration, with the 
consequent commercial legislation, that made 
apparent the need and stimulated the desire for 
control ; and this found its' completest expres- 
sion in the tendency to substitute for the 
Chartered Colony the Royal Province — a ten- 
dency that reached high-tide under King 
James II., and was checked by the Revolution 
of 1688 and the reflections of that event on this 
side of the Atlantic among the colonists them- 
selves. The Stuart plan had involved the 
destruction of Colonial legislatures and the union 
of the Colonies into governor-generalships. The 
result of the Revolutionary period was the con- 
tinuance of the tendency to establish Royal 
Provinces, but with the concession, through a 
compromise with local spirit, of provincial 
assemblies. 

This, in a few words, is the scope of the 
volume. Included, of course, is an account of 
Cromwell's colonial policy ; of the group of 
statesmen about the court of Charles II., who 
took an active part in the revival of interest in 
colonization, of the legislation regarding com- 
merce that centred in the acts of 1660, 1663, 
and 1673, of the machinery that was developed 
for the enforcement of these acts, and of such 
special commissions for the settlement of 
American affairs as those sent in 1664 to New 
England and in 1677 to Virginia. It is the 
impression of unity derived from the reading of 
this part of the work that gives support to the 
author's somewhat positive statement that in 
this volume " the attempt has for the first time 
been made to trace the history of this control as 
a distinct and separate feature of colonization." 

Yet, as Professor Osgood himself states, this 
is " something less than a history of British 
Colonial administration in America," because 
" the island Colonies, with Newfoundland, are 
for the most part left out of account." It is 
true, says the author in explanation of this 



omission, that Great Britain considered these 
more important than the continental Colonies, 
and thus laid part of the ground of the Revolu- 
tion ; yet the experience of the latter " amply 
illustrates all the phases of the British system 
of control." Whether this resolution to exclude 
the island Colonies is wisely taken is a matter 
of doubt. In the beginning of the volume the 
author dismisses with something like a non 
possumus the whole question of the extension 
to the Colonies of English law. One wishes, in 
view of the completeness of Professor Osgood's 
discussion of other phases of the subject, that he 
had devoted his own hand to this, at least to 
the extent of informing the reader that the 
English courts did consider the matter, and, in 
a series of cases from Calvin's case to Campbell 
vs. Hall, did formulate a doctrine ; and that in 
this series of cases one of special importance, 
that of Blankard vs. Galdy, was concerned with 
the extension of English statutes to the island 
of Jamaica, which had been added to the Empire 
by conquest from the Spanish in the time of 
Cromwell, ajid in which the matter of the ex- 
tension of the laws of England had been the 
groiuid of a long political controversy. How- 
ever, although one may find that Professor 
Osgood has not included all the English 
Colonies in America, and has not treated ex- 
haustively all phases of imperial control, one 
leaves the work with a feeling which constitutes 
a very real testimony to its value — the hope 
that before many years the author will continue 
it into the no less important epoch of the 
eighteenth century.

A Financier of the Civil War.* 



To the present generation the name of Jay 
Cooke means very little ; even so comprehensive 
a history of his own time as that of Rhodes gives 
him but a paragraph or two. But a generation 
ago his name and fame filled the land ; and 
when he fell, like a modern Samson he dragged 
down to ruin with him the business prosperity 
of the whole country. Though his reputation 
has proved to be ephemeral, like many another, 
and he is known if at all only as connected 
with the financial panic of 1873, Jay Cooke 
performed a vitally important service at a crit- 
ical time in the history of the nation, and it is 
well that a trained historical writer has told the

story of his life and of the service that he per- 
formed. The work worthily fills a gap in the 
financial history of the United States ; and 
not only the financial history, — but, as armies 
crawl on their bellies, and without vast sums 
of money the best-laid plans of statesmen and 
commanders cannot be carried out, the man who 
raised the money and maintained the credit of 
the country through all the confusion and stress 
is entitled to a secure if comparatively humble 
place on the roll of the benefactors of the na- 
tion. It may seem to the reader, in these days 
of exalted finance, that two volumes containing 
more than twelve hundred large pages are rather 
too much to ask him to read about a well-nigh 
forgotten financier ; but we can assure him that 
he will not waste the time that he shall devote 
to this book. Mr. Cooke left an enormous 
amount of material for this biography, includ- 
ing letters from many of the foremost public 
men of his time, with whom he was on terms of 
intimacy ; through these we get many glimpses 
into the inside workings of the government. He 
also left chests full of memoranda and remi- 
niscences. This material Dr. Oberholtzer has 
carefully worked over, supplementing it from 
the newspapers of the day ; the residt is a work 
that is not only an interesting biography of a 
man of unique power and personality, but also 
one that throws light on the public life, business 
methods, and moral standards of the decade 
from 1861 to 1873. Many portraits and fac- 
similes add to the value of the book. 

The father of Jay Cooke was a pioneer set- 
tler in northern Ohio, a man prominent in law 
and business ; he was elected to Congress in 
1830, and took a leading part in the develop- 
ment of the region. His brothers were sent to 
school ; but the future financier would not go, 
and at fourteen he went into a store. He dis- 
played great business ability wherever he was 
employed ; at nineteen he had a prominent posi- 
tion in a large Philadelphia banking house, and 
at twenty-one he had earned a partnership in 
the concern. In 1861 the house of Jay Cooke 
& Co. was launched, and it at once took a lead- 
ing position on account of the great reputation 
of its head as banker and successful promoter. 
The house lived only twelve years ; but they 
were notable years. One large enterprise after 
another was carried to a success that seemed 
impossible at the outset, and men became ac- 
customed to coupling the name of Jay Cooke 
with successful enterprises. 

More than five hundred pages of this work 
are given to Mr. Cooke's efforts to sell the 



different series of bonds issued by Secretary 
Chase, and the whole story, as told here in full 
for the first time, is one of absorbing interest 
and permanent historical value. It may be that 
the biographer exalts his hero's wisdom and 
foresight unduly at the expense of Secretary 
Chase ; yet it seems to be true that when Mr. 
Cooke's methods were adopted and his plans 
were followed bonds were sold with startling- 
rapidity, money was forthcoming tQ meet the 
drain on the national treasury, and the credit 
of the nation was maintained, and when Chase 
and his successors attempted to get on with- 
out him sales lagged and the money did not 
come in. His success was due to his belief 
in himself and in the people, and to the great 
organization that he built up for carrying the 
matter directly to them, appealing to their 
patriotism and their thrift at the same time. 
He could make plain men believe that the 
country was sound and would win in the strug- 
gle, and would keep its faith with those who 
should trust it with their savings. And so the 
money poured in, in a flood that astonished 
even the man of faith who had organized the 
movement. Some of the scenes described in 
this book are thrilling in their interest. The 
letters and newspaper extracts included give 
vividness to the narrative, though some of the 
judgments and opinions they contain are the 
product of the enthusiasm of the time. The 
author is wholesomely frank in giving Mr. 
Cooke's methods of dealing with public men 
and newspaper writers, some of which amount 
to bribery. But standards were different forty 
years ago, and no one can accuse Mr. Cooke of 
bribing men to serve his own interest ; it was 
the success of the cause that he had at heart 
that seemed to him to justify the sometimes 
questionable means employed. 

An interesting chapter is that on the estab- 
lishment of our system of National Banks, to 
which Mr. Cooke devoted the same energy, and 
in which the same astonishing success followed 
his efforts. Through his nation-wide organiza- 
tion, he created a public demand that made a 
hostile Congress take notice, and then hasten 
to pass the bUl creating the system. He under- 
took a campaign to bring the reluctant state 
banks into the plan, using to the full the prestige 
of his past successes and the persuasion of his 
powerful personality. Though the biographer 
may here also exaggerate somewhat his part, yet 
he presents documents that prove the value of 
Mr. Cooke's service in this vitally important 
development of our financial system.

A large part of the second volume is given 
to Mr. Cooke's efforts to promote, build, and 
finance the Northern Pacific Railroad. This 
was a tremendous undertaking, such as he de- 
lighted in. It was a private enterprise with 
enormous profits awaiting its success ; but the 
opening of a vast new region to settlement 
kindled his imagination, and the patriotic motive 
seems to have been even more powerful than the 
financial one. The full story of the negotiations 
at home and abroad for the hundred millions of 
dollars needed for the work is most interesting. 
Here again we see methods that we now call 
questionable ; instead of the success that at one 
time seemed near, through foreign political com- 
plications and the reckless fixing of capital in 
improfitable undertakings at home a crash came 
that ruined Mr. Cooke and was the immediate 
cause of the disastrous panic of 1873. In telling 
this story Dr. Oberholtzer gives all sides, but 
his admiration of his hero is so great that he can- 
not refrain from bitter criticism of those men of 
cooler blood who held back, criticized, and in 
some cases blocked Mr. Cooke's plans.

Canada From A French View-Point.* 



It was a happy thought of Dr. Siegfried's to 
bring his intimate study of racial and religious 
problems in Canada within reach of the large 
number of readers who could not read the book 
in the original. The French edition had already 
attracted a great deal of attention among 
French-Canadians, although, discussing the 
relations of Church and State with perfect 
frankness as Dr. Siegfried does, his book has 
inevitably not been popular with the ecclesiasti- 
cal authorities of French-speaking Canada. The 
translation, under the title " The Race Question 
in Canada," maybe commended to anyone, inside 
or outside of Canada, who is interested in the 
political and social development of the lusty 
young Dominion. 

Dr. Siegfried's opening paragraph admirably 
summarizes the scope of his essay. " Canadian 
politics," he says, " are a tilting-ground for 
impassioned rivalries. An immemorial struggle 
persists between French and English, Catholics 
and Protestants, while an influence is gathering 
strength close by them which some day may 
become predominant — that of the United 
States. In this complex contest . . . the whole 
future of Canada is at stake." Clearing the

ground in an introductory chapter. Dr. Siegfried 
proceeds to analyze very thoroughly and effec- 
tively this complex problem with which, in his 
view, Canadians are faced. Opening with the 
Catholic Church, he discusses with great clear- 
ness its administrative methods, its fear of 
English Protestant influence and its even greater 
fear of the spirit of Modern France, its extra- 
ordinary influence over the French Canadian 
people, and its intervention in politics. A 
chapter follows on Protestantism in Canada ; 
and here the author is equally outspoken in his 
criticism of the Protestant point of view. An 
interesting point which he brings out, incident- 
ally, is the practical impossibility under existing 
circumstances of Protestantism making headway 
among the French population of Quebec. If a 
French-Protestant marries a French-Catholic, 
he must agree to the children being brought up 
as Catholics ; if, on the other hand, he marries 
an English-Protestant, his children become, 
sooner or later, English-Protestants. In either 
case the French- Protestant strain dies out. 

Dr. Siegfried's treatment of the complicated 
educational problem in Canada, the very differ- 
ent points of view of the English and French 
elements in the country, the active interference 
of the Catholic Church and the less obvious but 
real influence of the Protestant Churches, the 
conflicting elements of provincial and federal 
authority, is admirable ; as is also his discussion 
of the attitude of French-Canadians and English- 
Canadians respectively toward England, France, 
the United States, and each other ; of Canadian 
politics, including the national constitution, 
political parties, elections, the tone of parlia- 
mentary life ; of French-Canadian ambitions ; 
the spread of American influence in the 
Dominion ; the movement toward Imperial 
Federation, which Dr. Siegfried believes to have 
already passed its flood and to be now well on the 
ebb tide ; and many other live Canadian ques- 
tions. He may be, perhaps, a little too inclined 
to accept the views of that brilliant but erratic 
young French-Canadian, M. Henri Bourassa, 
grandson of Papineau the leader of the Rebellion 
of 1837, as representing public opinion in the 
province of Quebec ; and he is certainly far 
astray in supposing that Dr. Goldwin Smith's 
well-known opinions as to the ultimate destiny 
of Canada are shared by any appreciable num- 
ber of Canadians. But taking his book as a 
whole, it is unquestionably one of the most 
interesting and reaUy valuable studies of 
Canadian problems that has yet been written, 
and compares more than favorably with the

Briefs on New Books. 



A beautiful 
new tree-book. 



In his handbook of the trees of the 
Northern United States and Canada 
east of the Rocky Mountains, Mr. 
R. B. Hough has done all tree-lovers and his country 
at large a real and important service. Here we have 
presented by accurate scientific description, and exact 
half-tone plates, more than two hundred species of 
American forest trees. Two opposing pages are 
given to each species. On the one hand we have 
illustrated the leaves, flowers, twigs, and fruits, 
nearly every character needed for identification, 
photographed to scale, so that the reader may know 
the actual size of these structures ; on the opposite 
page we have, with the descriptive matter, a photo- 
graphic representation of the trunk of the tree, show- 
ing the details of bark and habit, and again referring 
to a definite scale ; so that, all apart from letter-press, 
the illustrations in the book should make a competent 
forester of every man who can use his eyes. The 
scale applied to the tree-trunk to show its size is 
more often a two-foot rule ; but not always, as wit- 
ness page 325. It would seem ungracious to note 
errors in a work like this, published by the author 
himself (LowvUle, N. Y. ) ; but since in his preface 
he invites criticism for the benefit of a future 
edition, it may be said that errors, whether in typo- 
graphy or in the illustrations, are by no means few. 
A small map accompanies each species' description, 
intended to show the distribution of the tree in 
question. These maps are often inaccurate, some- 
times by as much as the width of a whole state. 
For instance, the witch-hazel is shown by the map 
as common to all Iowa ; the species reaches the 
Mississippi River from the east, but it is doubtful 
if it occurs within the limits of Iowa at all except 
rarely in one or two counties in the extreme north- 
eastern corner. On the other hand, the smooth 
sumac, which covers the country, is omitted entirely 
from this list of familiar trees and shrubs. Similar 
criticism may be made with respect to many other 
species cited. The distribution for the west side of 
the Mississippi River, as shown upon the map, is 
very often incorrect. The proof-reader also has 
done his work rather carelessly. Scientific names 
are not only wrongly spelled, but are differently 
spelled on different pages. A glossary accompanies 
the work, and this also contains many inaccuracies 
of definition and statement. Nevertheless, the book 
Mr. Hough has given us is unique and beautiful as 
well as extremely useful, and deserves a place in the 
library of every tree-lover in the world. 



Positivism as the Having in a previous volume, "The 
philosophy of Creed of a Layman," set forth the 
common-sense. grounds on which he had found 
peace in a religion of common sense, Mr. Frederic 
Harrison now endeavors, in a second volume entitled 
" The Philosophy of Common Sense " (MacmUlan), 
to show the intellectual basis on which such a faith 
is grounded. The book brings together papers read 
before the Metaphysical Society in the seventies, 
and essays published in English periodicals in the 
seventies and eighties, with little introduction of 
new matter ; but the collected issue of these various 
utterances in defense of positivism as the one and 
only common-sense philosophy forms a valuable and 
highly readable sequel to the preceding number of 
the series. Having found all other schemes of syn- 
thetic philosophy one-sided and incomplete, because 
they lean too far either toward theology on the one 
hand or toward science on the other, Mr. Harrison 
has, after twenty-five years' study of Comte's phil- 
osophy, convinced himself that it offers the one 
satisfying synthesis or harmony of the three great 
concerns of human life — religion, science, and con- 
duct. It alone is " adequate to weld into one 
common life our intellectual, our affective, and our 
active propensities." Abandoning the pursuit of 
absolute truth, and resisting the fascination of 
metaphysical puzzles, positivism contents itself with 
relative truth, truth as it affects human beings in a 
demonstrable and practical way. While bearing 
some resemblance to pragmatism, it nevertheless 
classes the latter with numerous other " more or less 
abortive attempts to solve insoluble problems." 
That the author has chosen a question-begging title 
for his volume is almost too obvious to call for com- 
ment. Positivism is the philosophy of his common- 
sense, just as materialism, or idealism, or Sufism, or 
Manicheism may be the most common-sense phil- 
osophy to another man. The philosophy of one who 
thinks for himself is a part of his very temperament, 
and no man can cordially accept another's philosophy 
in all its details — any more than Mr. Harrison can 
subscribe to every single article in Comte's creed. 



Life of a 
colonial 
worthy. 



Mr. T. W. Higginson has done a work 
of filial piety in writing the life of 
his grandfather Stephen Higginson 
( Houghton) . But the book is more than this. As 
the author says in his Apologia: "To have been 
one of the first American shipmasters called on to 
testify before Parliament as to American colonial 
matters ; to have been a member of the Continental 
Congress in its closing days ; to have been second 
in command during the first effective resistance to 
Shay's Rebellion ; the first to argue from that peril 
the need of a stronger government; the first to 
suggest that the voices of nine out of the thirteen 
States could make the Confederacy into a Nation; 
the first to organize and equip the American Navy 
under Jefferson's administration; — these afford 
sufficient ground to justify the writing of any man's 
memoir." Stephen Higginson began life as a

sailor, but left the sea at an early age and became 
a Boston merchant and one of the leaders among 
the Bostonians of his day. Like his contemporaries 
of the New England Federalists, he was very grave, 
very dignified, with the manner of one who felt 
that he carried on his shoulders the unstable burden 
of the welfare of " the masses." Probably no men 
ever took themselves more seriously, since the 
senators of the Early Roman Republic, than did 
these New England worthies. They felt, as clearly 
as did James the First, a divine commission to 
manage the affairs of their less fortunate fellow- 
men. Stephen Higginson was undoubtedly a man 
of sense and insight, but there is hardly ground for 
the implied conclusion that he shaped and directed 
national affairs through Washington and Knox. He 
was very influential in Boston affairs during many 
years, and the book contains valuable side-lights on 
life and social conditions of the time, and on the 
controversies and political bitternesses of the days 
when Federal power had been broken in the country 
at large and was waning in New England. His 
direct share in national affairs, beyond a few months 
of service in the dying Congress, in 1783, was his 
service as Naval Agent at Boston, in which posi- 
tion he did effective work in equipping a part of 
the little navy which the Federalists created during 
their last administration. 



Mr. Frederick Trevor Hill has put 
S^S:. t^pther a number of papers, con- 

tributed to different periodicals, into 
a volume entitled " Decisive Battles of the Law " 
(Harper). The author writes with acute legal 
knowledge and abundant information derived from 
painstaking research ; and to these he adds a gift for 
pictorial narrative which suggests a first-rate reporter 
present at the events he describes. The eight 
legal contests selected for study are regarded as 
" decisive " because they affect in greater or less 
degree the history of the United States. They 
range from " The United States vs. Callender : 
a Fight for Freedom of the Press" (1800) to 
" People vs. Spies et al. : the Chicago Anarchists' 
case " (1886). The other six describe the trial of 
Burr for treason (1807) ; the trial of John Brown 
(1859); the Dred Scott decision (1857); the 
impeachment of President Johnson (1868) ; the 
Alabama arbitration (1872) ; and the Hayes-TUden 
Electoral Commission (1877). Of these epoch- 
making crises in the nation's progress, Mr. Hill 
writes with general candor, with strong convictions, 
but with no unhistoric bitterness. He sympathizes 
with Andrew Johnson as the victim of a political 
persecution which deservedly failed ; he draws from 
the inglorious partisan conclusion of the Electoral 
Commission the comforting thought that it helped 
to abolish carpet-bag government in the South ; he 
recognizes Governor Altgeld's pardon of the im- 
prisoned anarchists as a " legitimate exercise of 
executive discretion "; and he strips from the Dred 
Scott case much of its romantic aspect as the heroic 



struggle of an abused slave against a cruel master, 
pointing out that " though half a century has elapsed, 
the question as to how the case started, who the 
plaintiff and defendant really were, what forces 
were behind them, and what their motives were, 
have remained uninvestigated, and the complete 
story of this famous lawsuit, largely based upon 
documentary evidence, is here for the first time 
recorded." These few hints give but a faint idea 
of the contents of an unusually interesting book. 

The relations ^^^o*' I^^^^g Fisher's work On « The 
of bookkeeping Nature of Capital and Income " 
ami economics. (MacmiUan) is a serious attempt to 
find a philosophical basis for accounting, and thus to 
supply the missing link between practical business 
usages and economic theories. The work ought to 
be of interest both to economists and to accountants, 
but some readers may be discouraged at the outset 
by finding familiar terms used with unfamiliar mean- 
ings. The author takes care to define his terms, 
however, and provides a summary of these defini- 
tions in the form of a glossaiy ; and since he has 
taken the pains to compile elaborate collections of 
definitions (at least of such important terms as 
income and capital) from dictionaries and economic 
writings, one hesitates to take exception to his 
decisions as to the meaning which ought to be at- 
tached to economic terms. Professor Fisher makes 
use of the mathematical method of demonstration 
in his appendices, but leaves the body of the book 
intelligible to almost any careful reader ; and on the 
whole it will conduce to clearer thinking on economic 
subjects. Ethical and public questions have little 
place in this volume ; but there is a sentence about 
stock-watering which is well worth quoting, namely, 
that to say that stock-watering is not wrong as long 
as all the terms and conditions are known " is much 
like saying that lying is not wrong provided every- 
body knows that it is lying ; for a false balance-sheet 
is only one form of a false statement, and, ordinarily, 
a false statement is made with intent to deceive." 
The book is provided with an unusual multiplicity 
of tables of contents : a " first summary," or list of 
parts, a " second summary," or list of chapters, and 
an " analytical table of contents," or list of sections ; 
while at the beginning of each part the list of chap- 
ters in that part is conveniently repeated. 



Conversation 
as an educator 



Much pleasant and profitable reading 
is to be found in Mr. Robert Waters's 
" Culture by Conversation " (Dodd). 
Its twenty chapters, with supplemental "table-talk 
notes " and other miscellanies, give the subject a 
thorough treatment, both theory and practice ( rules 
and illustrations) having generous space accorded 
them. The author is evidently in love with his 
subject, and his enthusiasm is contagious. One can 
even forgive an occasional affront offered to books, 
and such extreme statements as that " the study of 
books for a specific purpose never yet formed the 
mind of any man," so pleasantly and convincingly 



20 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



does Mr. Waters present the inestimable advantages 
of cultured conversation. Yet, true though it is 
that conference maketh a ready man, it surely is to 
be remembered that reading maketh a full man ; 
and no better proof of this last could be desii'ed 
than the book now before us. Let not its accom- 
plished author kick down the ladder, or this one of 
the ladders, by which he has climbed to the refresh- 
ing uplands of inspiring and well informed dis- 
course. The trend of some of his remarks reminds 
one of Mr. Bernard Shaw's humorous regret that 
his own education had been interrupted by a few 
years of schooling. A few details might call for 
criticism if space permitted. The inclusion of 
Brookfield among the " Cambridge Apostles " is 
probably erroneous : Brookfield consorted with them, 
but there were twelve without him, as Mr. Waters' s 
own list shows. The apt quotation from Langhorne's 
" Life of Plutarch " contains a few inaccuracies, 
according to our edition of the work. But these are 
trifling blemishes on a good and useful and enter- 
taining book. 

Actuated by a wish to provide a 
L^ZZlfopi practical handbook dealing with the 

construction, theory, and use of the 
microscope. Dr. Spitta, President of the ancient and 
honorable Queckiett Microscopical Club of London, 
has written a work entitled " Microscopy " (Button). 
It is, however, more than a mere handbook, for its 
nearly five hundred pages and fifteen plates make 
up a bulky and somewhat expensive volume. WhUe 
its pages are professedly not technical, they contain 
a very clear and scientific account of the optical 
parts of the instrument and of the scientific principles 
involved in bringing about its present marvellous 
perfection. Modern types of instruments are figured 
and discussed very fully, barring one — the product 
of a firm in this country whose unsurpassed objec- 
tives are distinctively an American achievement. It 
is hardly possible that a work dealing with the per- 
fection of microscope objective could be written in 
America and no mention made of the discoveries 
in this field of practical optics made by the Ameri- 
cans Spencer and ToUes. The author has written 
his book throughout from the standpoint of the user 
of the microscope. It is rich in practical hints which 
will enable the amateur to secm*e the maximum effi- 
ciency in his use of the instrument, and at the same 
time offers a lucid explanation, couched in as simple 
terms as this highly scientific and technical subject 
will permit, of the principles involved in the con- 
struction and use of the microscope. 

Short studies ^^^ ^^^®* sketches and essays, all but 
in life and one of them reprints, make up Mr. 

literature. Charles Sears Baldwin's " Essays out 

of Hours" (Longmans). Five of these " pleasant 
papers appeared originally in "The Contributors' 
Club" of "The Atlantic," and, with one that was 
first published in "Putnam's," are the best things 
in the book, or at least the most entertaining. 
Clothed in crisp, choice, sententious language, they 



are real gems in their way. The essay on travel, 
and that entitled " Not as One that Beateth the Air," 
yield genuine delight to the reader. Almost equally 
good is a short piece in praise of " Master Vergil." 
But who, alas, now reads the " ^neid," after having 
once laboriously done it to death in the schoolroom ? 
More pretentious chapters of Mr. Baldwin's book 
treat of Sterne's influence on French literature, of 
John Bunyan, and of the genesis of the short story — 
aU scholarly and good. But one is a little surprised 
to find the writer's scholarship permitting such 
blemishes as " unique " in the superlative degree of 
comparison, and " ruck " for the now more polite 
" majority " or " multitude." Of course " ruck " has 
a venerable antiquity behind it, and perhaps we 
ought to overcome our squeamishness and applaud 
rather than condemn an author's heroic attempt to 
reinstate the word in good usage. 

That voluminous editor and com- 

of^lmlTarTiifl. '^^^^^^^ ^* *^® middle nineteenth 
century, the Rev. Robert Aris Will- 
mott, is now best remembered, if remembered at all, 
for his "Pleasures, Objects, and Advantages of 
Literature," which was published in 1851, went into 
a fifth edition in 1860, and had already two years 
before enjoyed the distinction of a fifth German 
edition. Under the abbreviated title, " Pleasures of 
Literature," it is now republished by the Putnams, 
with a short biographical and critical introduction 
from the pen of Mr. Cranstoun Metcalfe. Willmott's 
style suggests that of the best seventeenth-century 
prose-wi'iters. It is ornate, and at the same time 
sententious, learned, and occasionally over-weighted 
with scholarly allusion and quotation, but always 
fluent, vivid, gracefully fashioned. To Jeremy 
Taylor, whom he faithfully studied and whose biog- 
raphy he wrote, he appears to owe as much as to 
any one author, though many sentences savor unmis- 
takably of Sir Thomas Browne. Wilmott is strong 
in the classics of Greece, Rome, and his own country, 
and is a writer good for us all to read in this day 
and generation, — a task which is made easy and 
pleasant by this republication of his little master- 
piece. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The " Essays Speculative and Suggestive " of John 
Addington Symonds is one of the weightiest of that 
author's many books. It was first published in 1890, 
and reissued, with revisions, in 1893, the year of the 
author's death. Both editions have long been out of 
print, and we are glad to note the appearance of a third, 
under the supervision of Mr. Horatio F. Brown. The 
Messrs. Scribner are the American pubUshers. 

Among the more recent works dealing with the career 
and character of Mary Queen of Scots, few have 
deserved a better reception than the study by Miss 
Florence Maccmm. As her work is of the popnlar type, 
the author makes no attempt at discussmg i» detail all 
the various problems that rise about the remarkable 
personality of the Scotch queen; her aun is to give a 



1908.]

picture of the queen and the woman — vivid, sympa- 
thetic, but truthful. The book first appeared two years 
ago, but has recently been issued in a "second and 
cheaper edition" (Dutton), which is, however, very 
satisfactory both as to presswork and illustrations. 

A new shilling monthly, " The International," edited 
by Mr. Rodolphe Broda, has been started by Mr. T. 
Fisher Unwin. It seems to be a successor, vnth a more 
popular appeal, to the defunct " Independent Review." 
The editor contributes a sociological i-eview of develop- 
ments all over the world, and his work is supplemented 
by brief contributions from a large number of local cor- 
respondents, and by a group of longer articles written 
by specialists. The publication as a whole stands 
strongly for the interests of social reform, and advo- 
cates numerous practical causes, such as woman suffrage 
and state interference with the conditions of labor, 
without much regard to their relation to fundamental 
principles. 



iNOTES. 



A text-book of " Spanish Correspondence," by Mr. 
E. S. HaiTison, is included among the recent educational 
publications of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

" Romeo and Juliet " is now added by the Messrs. 
Crowell to their " First Folio " Shakespeare, as edited by 
the Misses Charlotte Porter and Helen A. Clarke. 

Robert IngersoU's tribute to Abraham Lincoln, an 
interesting bit of shrewd and pathetic characterization, 
is now published in the form of a pretty booklet by the 
John Lane Co. 

Messrs. Charles H. Kerr & Co. publish the second 
volume of Karl Marx's "Capital," as edited by Mr. 
Frederick Engel and translated by Mr. Ernest 
Untermann. 

A volume on " Ship Subsidies," by Mr. Walter T. 
Dunmore, is published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. as one of the " Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Prize 
Economic Essays." 

Two new volumes in the " Pocket Library " of 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. give us, respectively, 
Mr. Andrew Lang's " Ballads and Lyrics of Old France," 
and " The Life and Death of Jason," by William Morris. 

Mr. Alfred Bartlett publishes Thoreau's essay on 
"Friendship," extracted from the "Week on the Concord 
and Merrimack Rivers," in the form of a neat booklet, 
nicely fitted for use as a token of the quality whereof 
it discourses. 

A third edition of Mr. Thomas Kirkup's " An Inquiry 
into Socialism," first pubUshed in 1890, is sent us by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. It is a small book, 
but more nearly adequate than many a larger one in 
presenting the essentials of its subject. 

That extremely valuable contribution to Shakespear- 
ian scholarship, Dr. D. H. Madden's "The Diary of 
JVIaster William Silence," has been reissued in a new 
edition, with an extensive new preface by the author. 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are the publishers. 

A set of five small volumes appears in the " Handy 
Information Series " of the Messrs. Crowell. The 
titles are "How to Play Golf"; a "Handy Book of 
Synonyms"; "How to Play Chess," by Miss Charlotte 
Boardman Rogers; "How to Keep Well," by Dr. 
Andrew Wilson; and a "Handy Book of Card Games," 
compiled by Miss Belle M. Walker. 



Important college texts recently published by the 
Macmillan Co. are " Exercises in Elementary Quantita- 
tive Chemical Analysis," by Professors A. T. Lincoln 
and J. H. Walton, Jr., and an " Introduction to Higher 
Algebra," by Professors Maxime Bocher and E. P. R. 
Duval. 

Mr. Richard Bagot has written a charming little book 
on " The Lakes of Northern Italy," which is now pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. It has many illustrations, 
and is something much better than a mere guide-book — 
although it may serve as such — being the work of an 
accomplished man of letters. 

A second series of Professor Francis G. Peabody's 
" Mornings in the College Chapel " is now published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. These short talks upon 
personal religion are admirable examples of brief and 
effective moralizing, and are well deserving of preserva- 
tion in their present printed form. 

The second volume (1822-25) of the Memoirs of 
Alexandre Dumas, in Mr. E. M. Waller's translation, is 
now published by the Macmillan Co. The publishers 
also send forth in similar style two other Dumas vol- 
umes — " The Crimes of Urbaiu Grandier and Others " 
and " The Crimes of the Borgias and others " — a grew- 
some pair of holiday books. 

A volume of " Specimens of Modern English Literary 
Criticism," edited by Professor William T. Brewster, 
is published by the Macmillan Co. The essays chosen 
are fifteen in number, Dryden and Johnson being the 
only representatives of an earlier century than the nine- 
teenth. Poe's " The Philosophy of Composition " is the 
only American example offered.

between National and State powers, and the regulation of labor, which the last few years have made burning ones ; and the

knowledge and a very uncommon aptitude in illustration and citation.

HENRIK IBSEN 



Illustrated. $1.00 net; postage 10 cents. By EDMUND GOSSE 

A brilliant and deeply interesting biography (a new volume in the Literary Lives Series) in which Mr. Gosse has made use 
of all the material in regard to Ibsen recently made available. 

In his introduction Mr. Gosse says : " It would please me best if this book might be read in connection with the final edition 
of Ibsen's ' Dramatic Works,' now being prepared by Mr. Archer in eleven volumes. If we may judge of the whole work by 
those volumes of it which have already appeared, I have little hesitation in saying that no other foreign author of the second 
half of the nineteenth century has been so ably and exhaustively edited in English as Ibsen has been in this instance."

A NEW NOVEL 



BY 



Ellen Glasgow 

AUTHOR OF "THE WHEEL OF LIFE," 
"THE DELIVERANCE," ETC. 

Clje Qlncient lata 

MISS GLASGOW is not only one of the most compelling novelists of America: 
her work shows a moral earnestness which causes it to tower above the flood 
of ephemeral clever books. With such a high aim and with an equipment of 
literary style, genuine feeling for human character, and an abiding sense of humor 
— it is no wonder that she has steadily advanced to a position where a new novel 
from her pen is an event of note to all those who take literature seriously. 

"The Ancient Law," a story of Virginia, shows the author at her best. It is 
a story of human struggle and human love — the triumphant picture of a strong 
man, Daniel Ordway, dominating, by sheer force of character, a relentless combi- 
nation of adverse circumstances. One finishes the book with fresh confidence 
and courage. $1.50.

GOETHE— THE OLD VIEW AND 
T HE NE W. 

Lewes's life of Goethe is a landmark of our 
youth. It stands in memory like a mountain 
peak tinted from base to summit by the rays of 
the sinking sun, with crowns of colored clouds 
floating above it. It is the history of a con- 
queror, the epic of a god. Usually, literary 
biography, though fascinating, is sad, — as mel- 
ancholy reading, Carlyle said, as the Newgate 
Calendar. It is almost always the story of a 
great soul in paltry surroundings — a record of 
struggles, aspirations, failures, partial successes, 
pitfaUs, a night landscape only relieved by 
flashes of lightning or the remote glory of the 
stars. But in Lewes everything is rose-color. 
Here is a Prince Fortunatus to whose cradle all 
the good fairies thronged. His life is a royal 
progress; triumphal arches are erected every- 
where for him. The divinity is visible in him, 
and everyone recognizes it. Men give him their 
good offices and women their hearts. It is all 
too good to be true ; but it is eminently satis- 
fying, like a novel where everything happens 
just as we wish it should. 

The one feature of Lewes's book which per- 
haps gave it its vogue, and stiU thrills and 
inspires, is this : it is, apparently, the life of a 
free man. The most of us are boimd, are tied 
hand and foot by poverty, by duties, by custom, 
Goethe, according to Lewes, did just about as 
he pleased. We look up from our drudgery 
and slavery at this resplendent apparition, 
flawless in all its phases of dawn, or meridian 
power, or serene sunset glory ; and the spectacle 
does us good. That Goethe used his liberty 
nobly, that he moved mainly in goodness, is 
only what we should expect, — what we believe 
would happen to us were we relieved from the 
chains that hold us down. And there can be 
no question that Lewes hit upon the secret of 
Goethe's life — that Goethe's main effort was to 
develop himself as a free agent, to rid himself 
of the bonds of custom, the tyranny of outside 
interference with His SeK. 

After Lewes, there came a long line of 
German biographers — Grimm, Diintzer, and 
the rest, for the most part painstaking, labori- 
ous, dull. To the true German, truth lies in a 
well, and for fear of missing the right fountain 



30 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



they dig holes all over the country. These 
historians and commentators rescued many minor 
facts and truths about Goethe's life ; but no one 
of their books gives any new or special inter- 
pretation of that life, or can pretend to rank as 
literature with Lewes s splendid and daring work. 

Now there comes a new biography, which has 
a definite intent, a novel interpretation, and one 
which, like Lewes's, is wrought to a single tone. 
The two are absolutely opposed. If Goethe in 
Lewes resembles Guido's picture of Dawn — 
Apollo preceded by the fluttering Hours — in 
Bielschowsky he is more like the drooping figure 
of the crucified Christ, lacerated and crowned 
with thorns. In Lewes, he is never sick or sorry 
or at fault. Bielschowsky shows him prostrated 
by grief and suffering, thwarted in his ambitions, 
flying from society in deep misanthropy, mis- 
understood by his friends, ignored by the public. 
He shows the man who claimed that in his whole 
life he had never had one week of happiness. 
He shows him like a Christian flagellant baring 
his back to the scourge because of his relations to 
women, revenging his lost loves by painting his 
own character in the darkest hues in the heroes 
of many of his plays and novels — the weak 
Weislingen, the cowardly Clavigo, the unstable 
Egmont. Lewes is always up before the day to 
help Hyperion to his horse, but Bielschowsky 
dismounts his hero from his high steed and makes 
him walk the earth like the rest of us. It is the 
treatment of Euripides after that of ^schylus. 
Instead of Orestes in his tragic mask and the 
Furies with their snaky hair, we get domestic 
scenes and Electra at the wash-tub. 

Unquestionably, Bielschowsky's method of 
dealing with his subject is more human and 
more humane than that of Lewes. But is not 
his method a product of our present and possibly 
passing mode of thought? Our age is anti- 
patrician — it is resolute to do justice to woman, 
to the poor, to the lower animals. It finds a 
higher pathos, a greater grandeur in Millet's 
Potato-diggers than in Marius brooding over 
the ruins of Carthage. It is doubtful whether 
such beliefs will hold. Greatness must regain 
its place in human imaginations. Take Goethe's 
entanglement with women, about which Biel- 
schowsky does not spare him, and for which he 
represents Goethe as unsparing in self-condem- 
nation. Would any one of the girls or women 
whom Goethe loved hftve chosen to have lost the 
Goethe episode out of her life ? His love was 
their crown of honor ; it brought them regard 
and consideration and immortality. One and all, 
they would have rejected with disdain the thought 



of parting with the memory of it. There is a 
legend in the Ramayana so pat to this point that 
it is worth repeating. The Brides of Indra, the 
god of the sky, grew weary of his love, — alter- 
nating, as the sky does, with extremes of heat 
and cold, light and darkness, tempest and calm. 
So they ran away from him, and, descending to 
the earth, wandered long, until they came to the 
country of the Uttarakurus. Here they found 
a monotony of pleasing life. The climate was 
equable, so that they needed hardly any shelter, 
the trees yielded fruits at all seasons, the people 
were pleasant and unperturbed. They resigned 
themselves to the luxurious comfort of the place, 
and the days glided on, one like another. But 
presently the memory awoke in them of that old 
home, of the burning joy of Indra's embraces, 
of the splendors, the tempests, the exultations 
and the agonies they had known. Their calm 
security and comfort became intolerable to 
them ; but, alas ! they had exiled themselves 
from that loftier life. 

It is curious that while Lewes aggrandises 
and Bielschowsky minimizes the personality of 
Goethe, the exact reverse is the case with their 
judgment on his literary work. Lewes's criti- 
cism is cool, sane, temperate. He hardly admits 
any part of Goethe's production, save the first 
haK of Faust and the lyrics, to be of supreme 
importance. Of Goethe as a dramatist, he says 
that with a large infusion of Schiller's blood he 
might have been a Shakespeare. Bielschowsky 
writes with indiscriminate eulogy of everything 
that came from Goethe's hand. He is utterly 
without comparative criticism. Each piece is 
described, analyzed, judged as if it stood by itself 
in the world — was the only specimen of its kind 
in existence. 

It seems to me that all opinion outside of 
Germany practically echoes the judgments of 
Goethe's first biographer. Is it true, for instance, 
as Bielschowsky seems to urge, that " Werther " 
is a classic of high rank? Historically, it is most 
important. It was the first prodigy of the storm 
and stress in Germany, and the parent of a vast 
brood of portentous monsters throughout Europe. 
But reading it to-day as a mere piece of liter- 
ature, it seems slight and trivial — not to be 
compared with many preceeding or contemporan- 
eous English or French novels. Similarly, " Gotz 
von Berlichingen " is a pioneer production in 
historical study, but it is certainly not equal in 
art and interest to much that has been done since ; 
"Egmont," "Tasso," " Iphigenia," are admir- 
able dramatic studies, but they are not dramas. 
Bielschowsky analyses "Hermann und Dorothea' '

THE DIAI.

as if it were a new "Iliad" or "Paradise Lost "; 
but charming as the poem is in its rich realism, 
it can claim only a place with the best modern 
idylls. Wordsworth surpasses it in profundity 
and Tennyson in beauty ; and " Paul and Vir- 
ginia," though in prose, has had a far wider 
success. The second part of " Faust " is good 
exercise for the wits of those people who take 
their poetry hard, but it is formless, amorphous, 
unfused. Probably Goethe's greatest books, 
after " Faust " and the lyrics, are " Wilhelm 
Meister," "Dichtung und Wahrheit," and the 
Conversations with Eckermann. The creative 
power in the first two of these ranks Goethe with 
the greatest novelists — hardly with the greatest 
poets. The criticism in Eckermann, and indeed 
throughout the multitude of Goethe's papers and 
letters, makes him the first of the discursive type 
of critics. He had not the central ideas or the 
gift of sequence of Aristotle or Lessing. And 
he had to the full the German power of platitude, 
the gift of discovering mare's nests. There is 
a discussion of one of his own Marchen, in 
Eckermann, which is almost sublime in its 
solemn inanity. 

Goethe's usual attitude toward his own work 
was one of unaffected modesty. He said of Mo- 
liere, "It is well for little men like us to recur 
often to the works of the masters." And when 
his enemies tried to place Tieck on a pedestal 
equal to his own, he said that the effort was as 
foolish as it would be for him to claim equality 
with Shakespeare, who was an incomparably 
greater power than himseK. 

Yet there was a time when Goethe exhibited 
a pomp and prodigality of creative force, an 
enthusiasm and fire, which bade fair to place 
him beside the greatest of all poets. In the 
Frankfort period, when the lyrics fell from his 
lips like the diamonds and pearls from the 
mouth of the maiden in the fairy tale, when 
" Faust " took form like autumn clouds collect- 
ing from the mist at the bidding of the wind ; when 
the fragments of " Prometheus," " Mahomet," 
" The Wandering Jew," were whirled off like 
rings from a swiftly condensing nebula, — then 
he was a great poet ; then he was all poet. Had 
he chosen to have kept on with this kind of pro- 
duction, had he dedicated his life to the Muse, 
it is impossible to say to what heights he might 
have risen. But he took another path — a path 
that led to decorations and power, and of course 
to temporary usefvdness and worldly duty well 
done. He became the Courtier, the Minister, and 
for many years poetry was little more than a pas- 
time for him. The Muse will stand anything — 



except to be patronized. She wiU make up to a 
peasant like Burns, or a thief like Villon. You 
may beat her and starve her and quarrel with 
her, and she will be faithful. But treat her 
de haut en has and she flies your house. Goethe 
became the great man of affairs, and then the 
cool rationalizing student and critic of men and 
art ; but the inexplicable gleam of imagination, 
the inevitable speech of inspiration, left him, — 
not all at once, but slowly and surely. He grew 
less and less a poet, as Shakespeare grew more 
and more one. 

It is with Shakespeare, of course, that he 
must be measured. He outranks all other 
modems, if only by reason of the wonderful 
dream reality of Faust. As compared with 
Shakespeare, he utterly fails in the creation of 
men — leaving out Mephistopheles, who is an 
improvement on lago. Shakespeare's gallery 
of male portraits is unequalled in literature. 
From the highest to the lowest, from King 
Lear and Hamlet to Falstaff and Justice Shal- 
low, the whole range of human intellect, the 
whole exhibition of human character in action, 
are there. How can the weak and shambling fig- 
ures of Goethe — Weislingen, Clavigo, Egmont, 
Wilhelm, Faust himself — come into competi- 
tion with Shakespeare's vital and virile types ? 

It is with his female creations that Goethe 
runs Shakespeare hardest, — and no one else in 
modern literature is in the race with them. He 
pierces perhaps as deep into the woman mystery 
as his predecessor, but he lacks his variety and 
splendor. Philina is as true a study of the 
baggage of easy virtue as Cressida or Cleopatra ; 
but how she pales' beside them ! Marguerite 
and ClJirchen are as impassioned and devoted as 
Juliet or Imogen, but they are not as full and 
rich. And the type of womanhood which we 
associate most with Shakespeare — the young 
girl, pure as crystal, but gay, daring, witty — 
this is entirely out of Goethe's list. 

In the gift of design — the faculty that looks 
before and after, that fuses a work of art into 
one flaming whole, that tones it to one tune — 
here (always omitting " Faust ") Goethe is sadly 
to seek. Nearly all his works depend for their 
effect on single scenes or passages or characters 
half detached from the canvas. Nature worked 
more powerfully in Goethe than art. As he 
rejected the beliefs in design and special crea- 
tion in the world — as he was an Evolutionist 
in science, a Neptunist rather than a Plutonist 
in geology — so in literature he preferred to let 
his creations arise spontaneously from his mind, 
rather than consciously to mould and arrange

them for a predetermined effect. And in speech 
he preferred the ordinary sentences of human 
conversation to the buskined phrases of the trage- 
dians or the weighted and involved words of the 
epic poets. In all this he was the precursor of 
the modern school, and Count Tolstoi and Mr. 
Howells should rise up and call him blessed. 
But if we look back on literature we shall find 
that the things that have lasted best are those 
that have been best put together, that art and 
style are not negligible quantities. Goethe, 
indeed, strove after art and style with all his 
heart and soul, but he had not the instinct for 
them. 

The friends of Goethe will perhaps put most 
stress on his position as a teacher of mankind. 
And there is a vast amount of wisdom in his 
works — wisdom of the sagacious, prudent, low- 
flying quality which we find in the essays of 
Lord Bacon or the proverbs of Franklin. " Here 
or nowhere is America " is a remarkable say- 
ing — but it would kill off the Columbuses. 
" Let every man sweep the street before his own 
door" is good sense — but it is also narrow 
selfishness. On the other hand, there is through- 
out Shakespeare's works a high spirit, a noble- 
ness, a generosity and largeness of soul, both 
in the gnomic utterances and in the pictures of 
life, for which we look in vain in the literature 
of his more sober and prosaic rival. This pomp 
and prodigality of heaven must for all time 
appeal to the young, the ardent, the high- 
minded, while Goethe's sagacity will make him 
the favorite of those who do not expect too much 
of man or life.

AN UNPUBLISH ED L ETTER OF POE. 

An unpublished letter of Edgar Allan Poe has 
come into the possession of The Dial, which now 
gives it for the first time in print. The original letter 
is the property of Mrs. A. H. Heulings, daughter of 
the late Rev. Hastings Weld, long time the Rector 
at Moorestown, New Jersey. Mr. Weld in early 
life was a well-known poet, story-writer, and essay- 
ist. He was one of the band of bright men who 
made things lively and interesting in the journals and 
periodicals of the forties. His " Corrected Proofs," 
a volume of light sketches and poems, has much the 
same quality as the work of N. P. Willis. Later 
in life he edited a collection of religious poems, 
which was popular. He was co-editor with Willis 
of " Brother Jonathan." One incident of his career 
is illustrative of the literary amenities of that day. 
In an article of his he had quoted a single stanza 



from a poem of N. P. Willis. The latter sued him 
for fifty dollars ! 

The Poe letter is written on a single sheet of 
letter-paper in the poet's clear and regular hand- 
writing. It is characteristically Poesque in its elab- 
orate courtesy and in the touch of temper at the end. 
Presumably Mr. Weld had been attacking Poe for 
some of his critical articles. The letter is as follows : 

Philadelphia, August 14, 1841. 
Hastings Weld, Esqr., 

Dear Sir: — The proprietor of a weekly paper in this 
city is about publishing an article (to be written partly 
by myself) on the subject of American Autography. 
The design is three-fold: first, to give the Autograph 
signature — that is, a fac-simile in woodcut — of each of 
our most distinguished literati; second, to maintain that 
the character is, to a certain extent, indicated by the 
chirography; and thirdly, to embody, under each Auto- 
graph, some literary gossip about the individual, with a 
brief critical comment on his writings. 

My object in addressing you now is to request that 
you would favor me with your own Autograph, in a 
reply to this letter. I would be greatly obliged to you, 
also, could you make it convenient to give me a brief 
summary of yoiu" literary career. 

We are still in want of the Autographs of Sprague, 
Hoffman, Dawes, Bancroft, Emerson, Whittier, R. A. 
Locke, and Stephens, the traveller. If among your 
papers you have the Autographs of either of these 
gentlemen (the signature will suffice), and wiU permit 
me to have an engraving taken from it, I will endeavor 
to reciprocate the obligation in any manner which you 
may suggest. 

Should you grow weary, at any tune, of abusing me 
in the " Jonathan " for speaking what no man knows to 
be truth better than yourself, it would give me sincere 
pleasure to cultivate the friendship of the author of 
" Corrected Proofs." In the meantime, I am 
Very respy. Yours, 

Edgar A. Poe. 

The signature of Mr. Weld, and all but two of 
the others asked for in the article, — whether fur- 
nished by Mr. Weld or not, it is now impossible to 
say, — duly appeared in the promised article. It 
was entitled " A Chapter on Autography," was 
originally printed in three parts, and may be ex- 
amined in the standard edition of Poe's collected 
works. It reproduces in facsimile the autographs 
of a hundred literary celebrities of the day — and 
in many cases of that day only. These signatures 
serve Poe as tags on which to hang an equal num- 
ber of those snap-shot cock-sure literary judgments 
which it was always his delight to evolve. Indeed, 
so anxious is he to play the critic that the proof of 
his pet theory that the handwriting shows the man 
speedily becomes a minor matter ; and once at least 
— in the case of Mr. Rufus Dawes — in his desire 
to characterize the author's longer poems as " pom- 
pous nonsense " he ignores the question of chiro- 
graphy altogether. 

Most of the literati whose signatures appear in 
Poe's article must have read it with considerable 
annoyance, unless they were blest with a sense of 



1908.]

humor strong enough to enjoy the extravagancies 
and contradictions of their critic's temperament. Of 
Washington Irving he coolly says : 

"Mr. Irving has travelled much, has seen many vicissi- 
tudes, and has been so thoroughly satiated with fame as to 
grow slovenly in the performance of his literary tasks. This 
slovenliness has affected his handwriting. But even from 
his earlier manuscripts there is little to be gleaned, except 
the ideas of simplicity and precision." 

The manuscript of W. C. Bryant, he admits with 
rather unusual candor, 

" Puts us entirely at fault. It is one of the most common- 
place clerk's hands which we ever encountered, and has no 
character about it beyond that of the day-book and the 
ledger. . . . The picturesque, to be sure, is equally deficient 
in his chirography and in his poetical productions." 

But it is when Poe comes to Emerson, whose 
autograph he relegates to the very end of his article, 
that he is most diverting. Thus he flouts our New 
England Jove : 

" His [Emerson's] present role seems to be out-Carlyling 
Carlyle. . . . The best answer to his twaddle is cui bono ? . . . 
Several of his effusions appeared in the ' Western Messenger ' 
— more in the ' Dial ' of which he is the soul — or the sun — 
or the shadow. . . . His manuscript is bad, sprawling, illeg- 
ible, and irregular — although suflBciently bold. This latter 
trait may be, and no doubt is, only a portion of his general 
affectation." 

Mr. Howells, in his book recounting his early 
experiences in Boston, records that on his first visit 
to Emerson he happened to mention Poe, whereupon 
the philosopher, after a moment's pause as though 
he were trying to recall the name, said, " Oh, you 
mean the jingle man ? " In this exchange of amen- 
ities, Emerson's characterization certainly had the 
advantage of brevity; but which was widest of the 
mark, it would be hard to say. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Some fresh reminiscences of Thackeray have 
been making their appearance in print of late. Mr. 
Whitelaw Reid, though he never met the great novelist, 
was for years a sympathetic listener to stories about 
him. From the Old Centurions of New York, whose 
testimony was unanimous, he learned that Thackeray 
was " big, hearty, and very human." " They didn't 
find him playing the lion the least little bit," adds Mr. 
Reid, "and we may hope he didn't find us playing the 
spread eagle too much. They pointed out the corner 
in the Century Club where he used to sit exchanging 
literary chat, or, in Yankee parlance, ' swapping stories,' 
with a group of clubmen about him. They could 
tell you years afterwards what had been Thackeray's 
favorite chair, and some had even been so observant of 
the least trifles about the great man as to know what 
particular concoction in a club tumbler had been his 
favorite ' night-cap.' " The late Professor Masson left 
some reminiscences, recorded by his daughter, which are 
now appearing in an English magazine. Of his early 
acquaintance with Thackeray he speaks at some length, 
and incidentally tells a story touchingly illustrative of 
his kindness of heart. An Irish friend, an improvident 
fellow to whom he had lent money more often and more 
generously than he could well afford, at last begged his 
help in getting an article accepted by " Eraser's Mag- 



azine," to which Thackeray regularly contributed. At 
considerable inconvenience, and only by withholding his 
own monthly contribution, the good-natured Englishman 
succeeded in gratifying the unthrifty Irishman. Soon 
after the article had been published, a correspondent ex- 
posed it as a gross piece of plagiarism, much to Eraser's 
annoyance, and even more to Thackeray's. But the 
light-hearted Celt, confronted with the proof of his 
literary rascality, only laughed heartily at it all as a 
good joke. And the man he had injured and deceived 
could not find it in his heart to give over loving him as 
a most delightful and typical specimen of the Hibernian. 
Things of this sort, added to what EitzGerald has said of 
his old friend in his letters, make it impossible for us to 
doubt that there really once lived such a man as William 

Makepeace Thackeray.

An English opinion of "The American Lan- 
guage " is entertainingly given in the current " Book- 
man " (New York). Mr. Charles Whibley, who has for 
about a year been making merry over the many strange 
things he saw and heard in this country, now delivers a 
criticism of our spoken idiom, which he finds curiously 
like, and at the same time curiously unlike, the lan- 
guage of his own land. Most surprising to us hurried 
and incoherent abusers of oral speech must be the 
Englishman's discovery that " America, with the true 
instinct of democracy, is determined to give all parts 
of speech an equal chance. . . . And so it is that the 
native American hangs upon the small words; he does 
not clip and sheer the imimportant vocables, and what 
his tongue loses in colotu* it gains in distinctness." 
Yet, times without number, we have been told that we 
clip and sliu-, elide and suppress, maimijig and mangling 
our words beyond recognition; and that we cannot 
pronounce even the name of our country, America, in all 
its four syllables. Mr. Whibley, furthermore, denies 
that we speak through the nose: " it is rather a drawl," 
he says, " that afflicts the ear, than a nasal twang." Our 
slang and our love of hyperbole he dislikes, very natur- 
ally, and also our fondness for "long, flat, cumulous 
collections of syllables, as 'locate,' 'operate,' 'antagonise,' 
' transportation,' ' commutation,' and ' proposition.' " Of 
these "base coins of language," the last on the list he 
calls " America's maid of all work," and adds that " it 
means everythmg or nothing. It may be masculine, 
feminine, or neuter — he, she, it. It is tough or firm, 
cold or warm, according to circumstances. But it has no 
more sense than an expletive, and its popularity is a 
clear proof of a starved imagination." Our picturesque 
" fall " (the season) he likes, but he shows himself a 
somewhat inacciuate observer in saying that " autumn " 
is unknown with us. Among reading Americans it is 
about as common as the shorter word. 

Our homely eighteenth-century manners are 
pleasantly pictm-ed in a rather remarkable diary of travel 
written (not for publication) by a certain Alexander 
Hamilton, M.D., and now printed in a limited edition 
for private circulation by Mr. William K. Bixby, the St. 
Louis bibliophile, to whom a small circle of book-lovers 
are already indebted for various other literary, ijuriosities. 
Of Dr. Hamilton little is known. Born in Scotland, and 
coming to this coimtry at some time after he had " learnt 
pharmacy " of an Edinburgh siu-geon, he settled at Anna- 
polis, where he practised his profession, but was forced 
by illness in 1744 to travel in search of health. Leaving 
home on the 30th of May he journeyed northeastward

in a leisurely and zigzag course as far as Portsmouth 
and New Castle, arriving home again on the 27th of 
September, after covering a total distance of 1624 miles. 
" Among the numerous joiu-nals and narratives of travel 
during the Colonial period," says Professor Albert Bush- 
nell Hart in a preface to the book, " few are so lively 
and so full of good-humored comment on people and 
customs as the Itmerarium of Dr. Hamilton." This is 
well ; for of unamiable pictures of early American civil- 
ization there is a sufficiency. Yet even our pleasant 
doctor was at times not exactly gallant toward the fair 
sex, though we need not judge of his conduct from the 
language of his diary. At Albany, he tells us, a friend 
" introduced me into about twenty or thirty houses, where 
I went thro' the farce of kissing most of the women, a 
manner of salutation which is expected from strangers 
coming there. This might almost pass for a penance, 
for the generality of women here, both old and young, 
are remarkably ugly." In Philadelphia and New York 
he shows hmiself somewhat critical of the ladies; but in 
Boston he deigned to be pleased with the daughters of 
a Mrs. Blackater — who was from Scotland, howeyer, 
wliich, perhaps, made all the difference. He finds fault, 
not unnaturally, with the night-cap as an article of daily 
wear. Worsted night-caps were common, and linen 
night-caps were " much worn in all the •churches and 
meetings of America that I have been in, unless it be 
those of Boston, where they are more decent and polite 
in their dress." The visitor was amused at the embar- 
rassment of two Philadelphians who appeared at a 
Boston dinner in linen night-caps. These evidences of 
superior refinement and culture in the Boston of a hun- 
dred and sixty years ago are interesting. Whatever the 
rest of the country might have been, Boston was no 
white-cotton-night-cap country.

The moving of Shakespeare's boxes (despite the 
epitaphic curse pronounced upon the hardy digger of 
the poet's dust) and the re-interment of those bones in 
Westminster Abbey is periodically agitated; and this 
appears to be one of the periodical years. Not untimely 
in this connection are Washington Irving's words of 
nearly a century ago, to be foimd in his " Sketch-Book." 
He says, toward the end of his essay on Stratford-on- 
Avon: " As I crossed the bridge over the Avon on my 
return, I paused to contemplate the distant church in 
which the poet lies buried, and could not but exult in 
the malediction which has kept his ashes undisturbed 
in its quiet and hallowed vaults. What honour could 
his name have derived from being mmgled in dusty com- 
panionship with the epitaphs and escutcheons and venal 
eulogiums of a titled multitude ? What would a crowded 
corner in Westminster Abbey have been, compared with 
this reverend pile, which seems to stand in beautiful 
loneliness as his sole mausoleum ! " Even more perti- 
nent is an earlier passage in the same essay: it seems 
to prove the proposed scheme impossible, in addition to 
its undesirabUity. " A few years ago," writes Irving, 
" as some labourers were digging to make an adjoining 
vault, the earth caved in, so as to leave a vacant space 
almost like an arch, through which one might have 
reached into his grave. No one, however, presumed to 
meddle with the remains so awfully guarded by a male- 
diction, and lest any of the idle or the curious, or any 
collector of relics, should be tempted to commit depre- 
dations, the old sexton kept watch over the place for 
two days, vmtil the vault was finished and the aperture 
closed again. He told me that he had made bold to 



look in at the hole, but could see neither coffin nor bones ; 
nothing but dust. " What visible and tangible " remains," 
then, will there be to move, if the moving is ever at- 
tempted ? The difficulties of exhumation and identifi- 
cation recently encountered ui the Druce Case are as 
nothing compared with such an attempt to dis-inter and 
re-bury, with due ceremony of solemn pomp, what is 
probably nothing now but a mouldy void, a mildewed 
emptiness. ... 

Literature and journalism are neither mutually 
inclusive nor mutually exclusive ; but they are strangely 
jumbled and as strangely contrasted in a recent address 
by Mr. H. G. Wells before the Institute of Journalists, 
in London. AU good literature he declares to be a form 
of journalism, made for the hour and destined, according 
to the laws of life and literature, to disappear with the 
hour. He also pronounces literature to be doomed and 
journalism destined to take its place, at the same time 
lamenting his fate in not being a journalist. Does he, 
by this lamentation, mean that his own books differ from 
" all good literature " in not being " a form of journal- 
ism, destined to disappear with the hour "? Does he 
deplore such elements of permanent worth as may be 
contained in " The Time Machine," " The War of the 
Worlds," and other ingenious romances of his? This 
fabricator of more than up-to-date fiction protests against 
the blind worship of a dead past, calling it a " cant of 
the day " to depreciate the present in comparison with 
antiquity. The only difference he can see between liter- 
ature and journalism is that "journalism does not pre- 
tend to immortality, and literature does " ; and, further, 
he says that "literature or classics are things of the 
past. We no longer produce them. The industry has 
died out " — and he is glad it has, apparently. For he 
asks, " What is the typist, the city clerk, or the self- 
educated working-man to make of Ben Jonson or ' The 
Faerie Queene '? " Nothing, probably, if he is content 
to remain a mere typist or clerk or working-man. In 
one of his lectures, Thomas Davidson used to speak with 
hearty contempt of " the self-satisfied smile of Philistine 
superiority " with which many persons proclaim their 
indifference to the permanent things of the mind, their 
meaning simply being, " We are stupid, low, grovelling 
fools, and we are proud of it." It is almost such a smile 
that we see on the lips of this praiser of things that 
" disappear with the hour." 

The myth-making propensity of children is 
never more strongly appealed to than at the holiday 
season, in connection with the Santa-Claus fiction; and 
annually there recurs the never-ending discussion, among 
well-meaning but unimaginative adults, whether the 
good saint ought to be allowed a longer lease of hfe. 
But a character so celebrated in song and story, and 
with so firm a hold on youthful fancy, may laugh defi- 
ance at these yearly threats to forbid his approach to 
the Christmas-eve stocking. The editor of a certain 
religious journal, far from joining in the outcry against 
Santa Claus as a promoter of pernicious make-believe 
and imtruth-telling, has a sensible word to say in his 
defense. " There need be no difficulty in dealing with 
Santa Claus and the children," he declares, "if one 
remembers that the children are natural poets and 
myth-makers. . . . We know a family in which for 
many years the plain truth about Santa Claus and Saint 
Nicholas has been told, and yet the children have got 
all the pleasure that those mythical characters could 
give. In the presence of the children the father of the

family arrayed himself in fitting disguise as a venerable 
old man, and then, as he added the last touch, the chil- 
dren's imagination did the rest, and he was, as by a 
miracle, changed before their eyes from the familiar 
person they knew into the Saint Nicholas of tradition 
and story. The plan had several advantages: the 
truth was told, the children were delighted with their 
share in the transformation, and there was no after- 
thought of doubt and disappointment. Children are 
adepts in the art of make-believe, and resent it when 
their elders do not let them share the secrets of the 
process." It is a truism that the child dislikes to have 
his make-believe rendered too easy for him. He 
knows, or more often she knows, that the rag baby is 
put together out of calico and sawdust; but it gives 
more genuine and lasting satisfaction than the finest wax 
doll from the toy-shop. The prosaic truth is all well 
enough in its own time and season; but it doesn't count 
in the land of make-believe.

A TWENTIETH-CENTURY DiCKENS is recognized by a 
noted French critic in the author of " Joseph Vance " 
and " Alice-for-Short." M. T. de Wyzewa, writing in 
the Revue des Deux Mondes on " The English Novel in 
1907," chooses one newer and several older novelists 
for comment and criticism. The newer one is Mr. 
William De Morgan. Readers of Mr. Chesterton's book 
on Dickens will remember that he predicted the sur- 
vival of Dickens's name and fame to the overshadowing 
of all other nineteenth-century English authors. The 
French critic inclines to agree with his English con- 
temporary in expecting Dickens to have an increasmg 
vogue, and he hails with satisfaction a possible, or he 
would seem to say a probable, successor to his kingdom. 
The preeminently Dickensian quality of Mr. De Morgan's 
two published works is, the Frenchman thinks, warmth. 
This fervor contrasts strongly with the more or less 
studied coldness of other current English novels. The 
author has his heart and head on fire while he creates, 
and the reader receives an indefinable sensation of heat. 
The characters and events are believed in by their 
creator, and readers are forced to believe in them too. 
M. de Wyzewa admits faults of style and execution, 
lack of originality in the adventures related, an absence 
of moral and psychological qualities of value in the 
books, — in short, the stories have no precisely definable 
merits of any sort; and yet he defies anyone to read 
them without an impression of tendre douceur of grace 
vivante, and of jeune gaite. This coronation of a suc- 
cessor to Dickens is a little early — more than a little 
early, in fact; but perhaps the Frenchman's removal 
in space from Anglo-Saxon soil may be accounted 
equivalent to a considerable remove in time from the 
present in which we ourselves judge of Mr. De Morgan. 

A NEW TITLE TO INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP has 
been acquired by Boston in Senator Tillman's assertion 
that it is "the head-centre of all devilment." This 
" golden opinion " will do to go with the oft-repeated 
charge from less " advanced " districts that the home of 
Channing and Parker and Phillips Brooks is a running 
sore of skepticism in religion, a hotbed of heresy in the 
things of the faith. Over against this adverse criticism, 
however, as a Boston writer has recently pointed out, 
is to be set Mr. Howells's well-considered opinion that 
" most of our right-thinking, our high-thinking, still 
begins there [in Boston] and qualifies the thinking of 
the country at large. The good causes, the generous 



causes, are first befriended there." One likes to see 
that Mr. Howells, though he long ago left Boston to try 
" a hazard of new fortunes " in New York, is still true 
to his early love, the city that greeted and smiled upon 
the young Western poet and romancer when he entered 
its gates m quest of fame and fortune. Nor must we 
forget that earlier devout tribute of Emerson's, con- 
tained (we believe) in a letter to Whittier, wherein he 
declared that when he opened his eyes in the morning 
and thanked God that he was alive, he also thanked him 
especially " that I live so near Boston."

An English censorship of the press is suggested, 
curiously enough, just at the time when England is mak- 
ing a strenuous effort to disembarrass herself of her 
absurd and discredited censorship of the stage. And 
this proposed return to medifeval methods was the 
suggestion of no fanatical pulpit-pounder or religious 
enthusiast, but of an English author, and one too whose 
familiarity with stage folk and stage history must have 
inapressed him with the foolishness of dramatic censor- 
ship as now conducted in his own comitry. It was at an 
Authors' Club dinner in London that Mr. Br am Stoker 
put forward this plan of his, saying, in anticipation of 
objections, that it is always the thieves and Hooligans 
who cry " Down with the police ! " and it is the immoral 
writers who object to a censor. Not so altogether; an 
innocent man does not enjoy being searched for stolen 
goods, and an inoffensive traveller is not made happy by 
having his trunk turned topsy-turvy in quest of dutiable 
articles which he has already declared it does not contain. 
Men cannot be legislated into morality, nor will govern- 
mental paternalism hasten the coming of the millennium.

A famous and successful bookseller, whose namp 
is a household word to book-lovers, and whose rise from 
apprenticeship to mastership in his trade is as interesting 
as a romance, is made the subject, or a part of the sub-

M. Hienri Rochefort of Ulntransigeant, is announced. 
Tlie name of the paper, the very sound of it as heard 
in the newsboy's shrill call, well denotes the character 
of its editor and his editorials. Aggressive and uncom-

It is not strange that he became familiar with prison life 
from the inside of stone walls and iron bars, that he 
passed some years in exile, and that he was challenged 
to many a passage at arms on the field of honor. Being 
now seventy-six years old, he may well feel entitled to a

his relinquishment of the editorial pen.

The Romance and Poetry of 
Provence.* 



On the appearance of Frederic Mistral's 
"Mireio" in 1859, Lamartine hailed its author, 
then only twenty-eight years old, as the Homer 
of his native land, and Adolphe Dumas styled 
him the Virgil of Provence. Honors and titles 
have ever since been offered him — some ac- 
cepted, but perhaps more refused — and it was 
not long before his great epic enjoyed the 
distinction of translation into other and more 
widely known tongues. Miss Harriet Waters 
Preston's English version, published in Boston 
in 1872, has long been familiar to American 
and British readers. Of the poet himself, his 
fair land of Provence, its folk-lore and its dialect, 
much has been written, in periodicals and in 
books, by Miss Preston herself as weU as by 
Mr. Janvier, Mr. Arthur Symons, the PenneUs 
(collaborating with pen and pencil), Mr. C. T. 
Brooks, Alphonse Daudet, and others. Of 
the movement known as Felihricje^ started 
by Joseph Roiunanille, but more properly 
and more closely associated with the name of 
Mistral, it may be well to give here a little 
account before taking up the early life of him 
who has made the word Felihre familiar to the 
reading world. In the " Memoirs of Mistral," 
as translated by Miss Maud from the poet's 
" Mes Origines," it is told how seven poets of 
Provence had assembled on the 21st of May, 
1854, in the full tide of spring and youth, at 
the chateau of Font-Segugne, when it was 
proposed, in view of the failure thus far of the 
young school of Avignon patriots to rehabilitate 
the Provencal tongue, that these seven should 
" band together and take the enterprise in hand." 

" ' And now,' said Glaup, ' as we are forming a new 
body we must have a new name. The old one of ' min- 
strel ' will not do, as every rhymer, even he who has 
nothing to rhyme about, adopts it. That of troubadour 
is no better, for, appropriated to designate the poets of 
a certain period, it has been tarnished by abuse. We 
must find something new.' 

" Then I took up the speech. ' My friends,' said I, 
' in an old country legend I believe we shall find the 
predestined name.' And I proceeded: ' His Reverence 
Saint-Anselme, reading and writing one day from the 
Holy Scriptures, was lifted up into the highest heaven. 
Seated near the Infant Christ he beheld the Holy 
Virgin. Having saluted the aged saint, the Blessed 
Virgin continued her discourse to her Infant Son, relat-

ing how she came to suffer for His sake seven bitter 
wounds.' Here I omitted the recital of the wounds 
until I came to the following passage : ' The fourth 
wound that I suffered for Thee, O my precious Son, it 
was when I lost Thee, and seeking three days and three 
nights foimd Thee not imtil I entered the Temple, where 
Thou wast disputing with the scribes of the Law, with 
the seven " F^libres " of the Law.' " 

At this phrase, " the seven ' Felibres ' of the 
Law," the seven young men cried out in chorus : 
" Felibre is the name ! ' Then followed, from 
one after another, the suggestion of various 
derivative terms, as " felibrerie," to denote a 
branch of Felibres numbering not fewer than 
seven members ; " felibriser," meaning to meet 
together as the seven at Font-Segugne were then 
doing ; " felibree," a festival of Provencal poets ; 
" felibreen," an adjective descriptive of the new 
association and its aims, and so on. The con- 
jectural derivation of Felihre^ ivom faire and 
livre^ may be referred to in passing. The task 
of compiling a dictionary of the Lancjue d ' Oc 
was assumed by Mistral himself, and completed 
after twenty years of devoted labor. Of this 
" Treasury of the Felibres " it has been said, by 
a competent judge : 

" The history of a people is contained in this book. No 
one can ever know what devotion, knowledge, discrim- 
ination and intuition such a work represents, undertaken 
and concluded as it was during the twenty best years 
of a poet's life. All the words of the Oc language in 
its seven different dialects, each one compared with its 
equivalent in the Latin tongue, all the proverbs and 
idioms of the South, together with every chai-acteristic 
expression either in use or long since out of vogue, make 
up this incomparable Thesaurus of a tenacious language, 
which is no more dead to-day than it was three hundred 
years ago, and which is now reconquering the hearts of 
all the faithful." 

But it is not for the completing of his dic- 
tionary that the world has of late had occasion 
to admire and applaud this poet-lexicographer ; 
but for his quiet refusal of a seat among the 
Immortals of the French Academy, when, con- 
trary to all precedent, the vacant chair was 
pressed upon him without previous solicitation 
on his part. Last year, too, he received the 
Nobel prize for patriotic literature — a prize 
that has been devoted by him to the cause 
dearest to his heart as a citizen of Provence. 
The gift from Sweden has gone toward the pur- 
chase of an ancient palace in Aries, to be known 
hereafter as the Felibrean Museum, and to take 
the place of the small and inadequate building 
now occupied by the collection of Provencal 
antiquities and curiosities. 

The little village of Maillane, situated in the 
midst of a wide and fertile plain, is the scene 
of M. Mistral's childhood and youth. His early

life here, and in the near vicinity at school, is 
delightfully pictured in the volume of memoirs 
now first offered to English and American 
readers two years after their translation into 
French from the still earlier Provencal original. 
They cover only the years from 1830 to 1859, — 
that is, from the poet's birth up to the publica- 
tion of his best-known work. He was the only 
child of his father's second marriage, a marriage 
pleasingly pastoral and romantic as described in 
the Memoirs. 

" One summer's day on the Feast of St. John, Master 
Francois Mistral stood in the midst of his cornfields 
watching the harvesters as they mowed down the crop 
with their sickles. A troop of women followed the 
labourers, gleaning the ears of corn which escaped the 
rake. Among them my father noticed one, a handsome 
girl, who lingered shyly behind as though afraid to glean 
like the rest. Going up to her he inquired : ' Who are 
you, pretty one? What is your name ? ' 

" ' I am the daughter of Etienne Poulinet,' the young 
girl replied, ' the Mayor of Maillane. My name is 
Delaide.' 

" ' Does the daughter of Master Poulinet, Mayor of 
Maillane, come, then, to glean? 'asked my father in 
surprise. 

"'Sir, we are a large family,' she answered, 'six 
daughters and two sons; and our father, though he is 
fairly well off, when we ask him for pocket-money to 
buy pretty clothes, tells us we must go and earn it. 
That is why I have come here to glean.' 

" Six months after this meeting, which recalls the 
old bibhcal scene between Ruth and Boaz, the brave 
yeoman asked the Mayor of Maillane for his daughter's 
hand in marriage; and I was born of their union." 

The scenes of country life and domestic happi- 
ness depicted in the Memoirs have all the fresh 
beauty and simplicity that might have been 
expected from the pen that drew them. The 
lack of any word for " home " in the French 
language, and the common but hasty inference 
that home-life also, at its best, is unknown to 
the people of France, seem strange enough to 
one reading again and again in French memoirs 
the homely and touching accounts of family life 
and family joys and sorrows. Taine's early 
years at Vouziers and the tender relations exist- 
ing between him and his mother have recently 
been described ; and now we have a still more 
charming picture of happy and affectionate 
domestic life in a Provencal farming com- 
munity. Equally effective is the writer's pre- 
sentation of the primitive agricultural methods 
of those unsophisticated peasant farmers of a 
day that is fled. Before introducing the scene 
of peace and innocence that he associates with 
his boyhood, he refers with sorrow to the 
invasion of American methods and American 
machinery. 

" Now at harvest time the plains are covered with a 



kind of monster spider and gigantic crab, which scratch 
up the ground with their claws, and cut down the grain 
with cutlasses, and bind the sheaves with wire; then 
follow other monsters snorting steam, a sort of Tarascon 
dragon who seizes on the fallen wheat, cuts the straw, 
sifts the gram, and shakes out the ears of corn. All 
this is done in latest American style, a dull matter 
of business, with never a song to make toil a gladness, 
amid a whirl of noise, dust, and hideous smoke, and the 
constant dread, if you are not constantly on the watch, 
that the monster will snap off one of your limbs. This 
is Progress, the fatal Reaper, against whom it is useless 
to contend, bitter result of science, that tree of knowl- 
edge whose fruit is both good and evil. 

Contrast with this the simple ways of those 
earlier tillers of the soil of whom the poet's 
father was one. The word "corn "is of course 
to be taken in the generic, not the specific or 
American, sense. 

" As in the days of Cincinnatus, Cato, and Virgil, we 
reaped with the sickle, the fingers of the right hand 
protected by a shield of twisted reeds or rushes. . . . 
Every day at dawn the reapers ranged themselves in 
line, and so soon as the chief had opened out a pathway 
through the cornfield all glistening with morning dew, 
they swungtheir blades, andas they slowly advanced down 
fell the golden com. The sheaf-binders, most of whom 
were young girls in the freshness of their youthfxil bloom, 
followed after, bending low over the fallen grain, laugh- 
ing and jesting with a gaiety it rejoiced one's heart to 
see. Then as the sun appeared bathing the sky all rosy 
red and sending forth a glory of golden rays, the chief, 
raising high in the air his scythe, would cry, ' Hail to 
the new day,' and all the scythes would follow suit. 
Having thus saluted the newly risen sun, again they fell 
to work, the cornfield bowing down as they advanced 
with rhythmic harmonious movement of their bare 
arms. ... It was in this company, the grand sun of 
Provence streaming down on me as I lay full length 
beneath a willow-tree, that I learnt to pipe such songs 
as ' Les Moissons ' and others in ' Les lies d' Or.' " . 

Although the son of Master Francois Mistral 
was sent away to learn his Latin and afterward 
to study law, he seems never for a moment to 
have proposed for himseK the practice of the 
profession for which he had made these prelim- 
inary studies. But rather, when he reached the 
age of one-and-twenty, it was his resolve " first, 
to raise and revivify in Provence the sentiment 
of race that I saw being annihilated by the false 
and unnatural education of all the schools ^ 
secondly, to promote that resurrection by the 
restoration of the native and historic language 
of the country, against which the schools waged 
war to the death ; and lastly, to make that 
language popular by illuminating it with the 
divine flame of poetry." And on a later page 
he says : " So it came to pass that I abandoned, 
once and for all, inflammatory politics, even as 
one casts off a burden on the road in order to 
walk more lightly, and from henceforth I gave 
myself up entirely to my country and my art —

fulfiUed. 

The book has (to give it the highest of all 
praise) charm : it captivates the reader and 
holds his attention to the end. Miss Maud's 
translation is smooth, but — horresco ref evens 
— not always grammatical. " Laid down " for 
" lay down " is bad, and '•'• between these and 
we" is worse. Mrs. Harrison's interspersed 
and appended lyrics from the Provencal are 
skilfully executed. The portraits and other 
illustrations are many and good.

Venice in the Golden Age.* 

We usually think of the so-called Renaissance 
as an age of creative intellect, an age that 
renewed the European world. The correctness 
of this view is beyond dispute ; still, all the 
achievements of the period were not construc- 
tive. We often forget that this same intellec- 
tual upheaval threw much of the old world into 
ruins. The passing of feudalism, with all that 
the term implies, the historian can contemplate 
without regret. That the characteristic ideals 
of the Middle Ages shoidd perish, is not strange 
and hardly to be deplored ; their day of useful- 
ness was over. But along with these much was 
destroyed that the world could ill afford to lose. 
Says Professor Molmenti, in speaking of the 
Italian Renaissance : 

" The excessive and exclusive passion for the redis- 
covered culture of Greece and Rome destroyed all 
religious sentiment, and converted the people of Italy 
into the most skeptical of European races. The exag- 
gerated devotion to the antique which animated courts, 
palaces, and streets, weakened the spirit of patriotism. 
The new learning . . . distracted men's minds from 
the active life of the nation; and so, on the ruins of 
communal life, arose the despots." 

But to aU this, Venice seems to be an exception. 
Venice had her share in the Renaissance : she 
had her Aldus Manutius, her Titian, her Cabots, 
and hosts of others of lesser fame ; she had 
schools and libraries, poets and painters, build- 
ers and navigators. But the new movement did 
not overwhelm Venice ; the city continued her 
independent cai'eer along the old lines, under the 
old constitution, busied more than ever with com- 
merce and conquest ; her golden age had begun. 
It is this age that Professor Molmenti dis-

cusses in the second section of his work on 
Venetian private life. In these volumes the 
plan is the same as in the earlier ones : a 
series of essays, each dealing with some phase 
of Venetian life and activity. As the period 
covered in this section is scarcely more than a 
century (roughly speaking, from 1450 to 1550), 
this plan can be carried out with greater success 
than in the work on the Middle Ages. Of par- 
ticidar interest are the chapters on municipal 
activities, such as measures affecting the public 
health (surely a problem in a city like Venice) 
and the embellishment of the city ; Venetian art 
and the private life of the artists ; the new move- 
ments in science and literature, including such 
subjects as schools, libraries, and the press ; the 
type of beauty in men and women, and family 
life in the upper and lower classes. In a large 
measure, therefore, the work desals with the 
forms in which the Renaissance expressed itself 
in Venice. It is further provided with a great 
number of excellent illustrations — photographs 
showing the triumphs of the period in the indus- 
trial arts and architecture, and beautiful repro- 
ductions of the works of such masters in painting 
as Titian, Tintoretto, and Paris Bordon. 

We have said that Venice alone of the Italian 
cities seems to have survived the Renaissance ; 
but the survival is more apparent than real. 
Venetian grandeur in the fifteenth century was 
the culmination of centuries of effort, but it also 
marked the beginning of municipal and imperial 
decline. In the words of our historian, — 
" Beneath this dazzling exterior, even in Venice, the 
most powerful and flourishing state in the peninsula, the 
germs of corruption gradually made themselves mani- 
fest. Trade and industry came to be despised by the 
patricians and were left to the people, morals degen- 
erated, and the population which in the first twenty years 
of the fifteenth century numbered 190,000 souls steadily 
declined." 

Of special interest is the closing chapter of 
the work, " The Corruption of Manners," in 
which the author gives us a detailed picture 
of moral depravity that is almost past belief. 
But the wealth, the power, the glory that had 
reacted so viciously on Venetian character was 
soon to pass : with the opening of the sixteenth 
century commercial decline becomes evident. 
For this, three reasons may be assigned : the 
newer ambitions for possessions on the mainland 
of Italy, in the pursuit of which the resources 
of the city were dissipated ; the discovery of 
the new route to Asia which established com- 
petition all along the western coast of Europe and 
condemned the Adriatic trade to a slow but sure 
death ; and, lastly, the losses to the Turks in 



1908.]

the Archipelago and along the Dalmatian coast 
which shattered the prestige of the Venetian 
navy. It is interesting to note that in 1502 the 
Venetian government, realizing the new state 
of affairs, proposed to the Soldan of Egypt that 
a canal be cut through the Isthmus of Suez. 

The historical writer who delights in the 
picturesque can hardly find a more congenial 
subject than Venice at the opening of the mod- 
ern age ; it is a theme that ought to call out his 
best energies. But when we come to consider 
how the author and the translator in the present 
case have done their work, we confess to a feeling 
of disappointment. As in the earlier volumes 
the defect that strikes one first is the inadequate 
translation. The author quotes quite freely 
from his sources, and all such extracts the 
translator has left in the original. Frequently 
the reader strikes an entire page where English 
is almost wanting ; consequently, to the student 
who knows no Italian the work is of doubtful 
value. At times the reader is left with the 
feeling that the author has not wholly mastered 
his materials, that the quality of discrimination 
is wanting. In his effort to mention all who 
have achieved prominence in any given field, 
the author often fails to give us anything but 
a mere list of names. In one case, nearly fifty 
artists are named on a single page (I., 101); 
many such pages make didl reading. Still, on 
the whole the work is neither dull nor dry ; on 
the contrary, the style is often so florid and 
exuberant as to provoke amusement. In many 
respects these volumes are an improvement on 
the earlier ones ; but in the study of a single 
century so rich in sources as that which fol- 
lowed the invention of printing, we should 
expect a more positive expression of historical 
virtues than in a work covering nearly a thou- 
sand years and based on the sometimes dreary 
and often fragmentary annals of the Middle 
Ages. Laurence M. Laeson. 



«< The Shakespeare Library," as edited by Pro- 
fessor Gollanez and published by Messrs. Duffield & Co., 
has an elastic plan which permits the publication of many 
sizes of volumes. We recently made mention of some 
of the smaller volumes, and we now note the appearance 
of three of the larger ones. The largest of all is entitled 
" Shakespeare's Holinshed," and brings mto comparison 
the text of the Chronicle with the historical plays. This 
is the work of Mr. G. Boswell-Stone. Another volume 
is " Robert Laneham's Letter, Describing a Part of the 
Entertainment unto Queen Elizabeth at the Castle of 
Kenilworth m 1575," edited by Mr. F. J. Furnivall. 
The third volmne, also edited by Mr. Furnivall (with 
the aid of Mr. Edward Viles), is called " The Rogues 
and Vagabonds of Shakespeare's Youth." 



Socialism condemned.* 



As Mr. Mallock explains in a prefatory note 
to his " Critical Examination of Socialism," he 
was invited in the autumn of 1906 to deliver a 
series of addresses on the subject of Socialism, 
in America. Most of us have already heard or 
read a good deal about the things Mr. Mallock 
said and did in this country ; and no doubt 
enough interest has been aroused to ensure his 
book a large circtdation. It may also be anti- 
cipated that of those who take up the volume 
most will read it through ; for the author, what- 
ever else may be said of him, is not dull. 

The main argument, so far as it may be con- 
densed into a few words, is as follows : Manual 
labor is not the source of all wealth ; in parti- 
cular, its effects are increased many fold by 
directive ability, including in this term invention 
as well as the immediate application of directive 
intelligence to industrial operations. It is evi- 
dent from the work of craftsmen in ancient 
times, that manual skill has not sensibly in- 
creased for many centuries, and hence the great 
additions to wealth now realized by human effort 
must be due to directive ability. It follows that 
inasmuch as this ability is exercised by the few, 
and yet is responsible for more than half the 
output, ordinary labor is not only not deprived 
of any of its just share, but actually receives 
much more than it would be entitled to on prin- 
ciples of abstract justice. It also follows that 
if directive ability were not exercised, and if 
there were not means to compel the mass of 
workers to submit to it, the product of labor 
would rapidly fall, and the whole country would 
be impoverished. Those who are conscious of 
special ability will not as a rule exercise it unless 
given sufficient inducements to do so. The pos- 
sibility of acquiring wealth and power affords 
such an inducement in the modem world, and 
attracts to the management of industry such 
abilities as would in earlier times have been 
given to aggressive war and other non-productive 
enterprises. At the same time, those who engage 
in production are compelled to be serviceable to 
mankind at large, for if their product is unsatis- 
factory, actually or relatively, the public will 
not pay for it, and the business fails. To dimin- 
ish seriously the rewards of directive ability 
would be disastrous, as it might cause much of 
this ability to be withdrawn from industrial 
enterprises. To free the workers from obliga- 
tion to obey the commands of those over them

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



would be equally disastrous, as it is only by 
submitting to such commands that production 
can be kept up to the present level or increased. 
Hence some form of " wage slavery," so-caUed, 
is inevitable, and the so-called " unearned incre- 
ment " is not taken from those who had any- 
thing to do with its production. The manage- 
ment of industry by the State would necessarily 
amount to this, that in place of various separate 
corporations there would be substituted one 
great one, against the operations of which there 
woidd be no appeal, and the success of which 
would not be checked in every detail by com- 
parison with other like enterprises. 

Some indication is given throughout the vol- 
ume of the criticisms made by Socialists at the 
time the addresses were delivered. The matter 
is complicated by the fact that there is great 
diversity among the Socialists themselves con- 
cerning their doctrines ; no doubt even more 
diversity than there is among non-Socialists 
about practical politics, inasmuch as ideals are 
not kept within the narrow bounds prescribed 
by actual conditions. It is unfortunate, though 
no doubt inseparable from the authorship, that 
the criticisms of other writers, great and small, 
are given in the most arrogant and unsympa- 
thetic spirit, and hence tend to provoke oppo- 
sition rather than an effort to come to some 
reasonable imderstanding. One does not need 
to be a Socialist to feel continually that argu- 
ments are overstrained and facts ignored. All 
must agree with the proposition that modem 
human society needs all the ability, manual or 
otherwise, which it can command for the pur- 
poses of useful production. It is equally evi- 
dent that this ability will not be forthcoming 
without suitable stimuli, and no one doubts that 
it is one of the principal cares of organized man- 
kind to provide such stimuli in proper amount 
and kind. The practical question is, granting 
organized industry, how shaU individuals be so 
stimulated that their reactions will result in the 
greatest good to themselves and their fellows ? 
In the case of any other species but Homo 
sapiens, the answer is relatively simple, because 
the stimuli and reactions are normally very con- 
stant, and practically the same for all. The 
choice of good and evil, given to man. is indeed a 
dangerous weapon, as well as a means of incalcu- 
lable advantage. Judges we are, however, and 
we find ourselves in the position of having to de- 
cide what lines of conduct are to be encouraged, 
what repressed. The rough and ready methods of 
modern capitalism do indeed have their influence 
upon conduct, and in many respects this influence 



is unquestionably beneficial. It is nevertheless 
a most hopeful sign that men are coming more 
and more to see that a far greater measure of 
justice and economy, and ultimately of happiness, 
is attainable ; and having come to this conclusion, 
are determined to further its attainment. 

The most obvious objection to Mr. MaUock's 
position, and the most fundamental, concerns his 
assumption that to-day superior ability is suitably 
rewarded, having regard to its services. If any- 
one will consider for a moment the history and 
present status of, let us say, the industries con- 
nected with electricity, it wiU be apparent that 
the relation between service and reward is of the 
loosest possible kind. Mr. MaUock freely recog- 
nizes invention as part of " directive ability," 
whether the ideas formulated are carried out at 
the time, or long after ; and it is well known 
that the various applications of electricity, like 
practically all applications of scientific discovery, 
rest upon the work of generations of men, many 
of whom never lived to know the economic value 
of their work, or receive the commensurate 
rewards. To argue that those who finally bring 
this work to the point of productivity are to be 
regarded for practical purposes as the producers 
of the new wealth, is to take an absurdly narrow 
view. Mr. Mallock reasons that if we choose 
we may remove the " cause " of anjiihing indefi- 
nitely, and that for practical ends we treat the 
proximate causes as real ones ; and in particu- 
lar, must so treat those over which we have any 
control. This is somid enough, but it requires 
little imagination to see that of all the controlla- 
ble causes contributing to the advancement of 
production, the researches of science, prior to any 
possibility of commercial profit, are of the most 
fundamental importance. Passing over this phase 
of the matter, however, we find ourselves asking 
whether as a matter of fact the most useful mem- 
bers of society, having regard to the immediate 
residts of their labors, are the most encouraged, 
and particularly whether pernicious activities of 
various kinds are adequately checked. It hardly 
seems possible to me that any thoughtful person, 
socialist or otherwise, can be satisfied with Mr. 
MaUock's treatment of these questions. 

An ideal human society, so far as I am able 
to imagine it, would be one in which all the 
individuals were usefully and happily occupied, 
each one in the manner most profitable, having 
regard both to his nature and the needs of his 
fellows. That all woidd have the means neces- 
sary for life and work needs scarcely to be 
postulated, as without it the first condition could 
not obtain. In such a society the rich man

would be the one capable of using more than 
most of his fellows, whether of materials or of 
service, or both. Organization would be carried 
to a high pitch, no doubt ; but constant effort 
would be made to avoid sacrificing the man for 
the sake of increased production, as is habitually 
done to-day. It would remain, as it is to-day, a 
constant problem to secure a rational equilib- 
rium between the tendency to uniformity pro- 
moted by the majority, and the nonconformist 
activities of individuals and groups. This antag- 
onism is woven into the very fabric of our 
existence, and without it life would sink below 
the level of rational consciousness. Similarly, 
as the bud waits for the stimulus of the sun's 
rays, so every individual would depend for 
proper development upon awakening forces, 
some provided by nature, others furnished, con- 
sciously or otherwise, by his fellows. That the 
man-made inducements to the exercise of " direc- 
tive ability" need be of the gross and often 
demoralizing character that they are in present- 
day industrial life is as absurd a proposition as 
one which might have been put forward in less 
civilized times, that no healthy man could be 
happy without adequate opportunities for com- 
mitting murder. It is not contended that the 
question of stimuli is a simple one ; on the con- 
trary, it is one of the most difficult, involving, 
with the responses, the whole matter of the 
interrelations of human beings and the conse- 
quent interest of human life. 

The truth is, that Socialism does not imply 
a state of society wholly different from the 
present ; nor is it a means of escaping the basic 
problems and difficulties which vex us to-day. 
Mr. Mallock himself says that " Socialism, no 
matter how false as a theory of society, and, no 
matter how impracticable as a social programme, 
will have called attention to evils which might 
otherwise have escaped attention, or been rele- 
gated to the class of evils for which no allevi- 
ation is possible." If Socialists are themselves 
of diverse opinions, if they remain vague as to 
details of their programme, these things need 
not be regretted, for there is thereby assured a 
plasticity which will permit adaptations to the 
various conditions arising in the course of social 
evolution. In attacking the theories advanced, 
Mr. Mallock has done a good service. On the 
purely intellectual side, his criticisms, valid or 
otherwise, will arouse fruitful thought and dis- 
cussion ; but though we must admit that he 
justly accuses many socialists of improperly 
prejudicing the subject, we cannot acquit him 
of this same fault. T. D. A. Cockerell. 



Ax ENGI.ISH IjIFE of TASSO.* 



In attempting a new biography of Torquato 
Tasso, Mr. William Boulting had a golden 
opportunity. Off the Continent, the field was 
free and virtually untrodden. The most recent 
life in English, an essay by Mary C. PhUlimore, 
appeared over twenty years ago. The better- 
known work of Milman (1850) and the life by 
Henry Wilde (1848) have long been hope- 
lessly antiquated. Meanwhile the unwearied 
researches of the Italians, above all Mazzoni and 
Solerti, not to speak of subtle interpretations 
by such men as Carducci and Nencione, or to 
mention an array of monographs in France 
and Germany, have given substance and pre- 
cision to the meagre outline, inaccurate and 
misleading, that used to pass for a biography of 
Tasso, and have gone far toward putting him 
and his poetry into something like true relations 
with the age that begot them. To present 
the results merely of Italian scholarship and 
criticism, to give us in succinct and readable 
English an accoimt of the author of " Jerusalem 
Delivered " as he is now known in his own 
country, and to do this in such fashion that 
we might be sure the picture was true both in 
the single details and in the sum of them, was, 
for a literary man, the chance of a lifetime. 
This was Mr. Boulting's chance. How has he 
accepted it ? 

So far as we can judge, he has proceeded as 
follows : he has read his authorities with atten- 
tion though not with a high degree of scholarly 
acumen, has gathered excerpts and quotations 
liberally, though in the main without anxiety to 
recall the particular sources from which they 
were copied, and then, with a certain impetus 
and abandon, — cutting his bridges, so to speak, 
behind him, — he has marched rapidly through 
the enemy's domain. The enemy means the 
devotee of minute scholarship — the dunderheads 
whose love for Tasso has been so thorough that 
they have spent decades in quest of the slightest 
shreds of truth about him, when any one of 
them might have written a popular life of him 
in a tenth of the time. Their stores Mr. Boulting 
has not been loth to ransack, while treating the 
owners with apparent disdain. Of the four 
foot-notes throughout his 307 pages of text, only 
one refers to any author who has written on 
Tasso, and that one to Milman. We should have 
been better satisfied if Mr. Boulting had every- 
where specifically indicated his indebtedness to

the fifty-three works cited in his Bibliography 
(pp. 309, 310); for however the absence of such 
indication may appeal to the author, it strikes 
the conscientious reader as a serious and baffling 
omission. 

In consequence of the omission, one is priv- 
ileged to estimate the volume in part by its 
attitude toward scholarship and life in general. 
" Most scholars," we learn on page 53, " are 
men of narrow if not mediocre intelligence," 
locking themselves up " in pedantry," and en- 
deavoring " to impose their own fetters on men 
of real life and spirit." This, though said (or 
rather because it is said) incidentally, is signi- 
ficant enough, and needs no comment. Again, 
here is an edifying view of life, in the portrayal 
of a Venetian marriage (p. 46) : 

"Two young people are made one: probably they 
will learn to love one another [each other ?] as indif- 
ferently well or hate one another with much the same 
fervor as other married folk ; at present they are almost 
strangers." 

What, one would like to know, has that sort 
of twaddle to do with Tasso ? Wherever it is 
found, in Lord Chesterfield's Letters or out 
of them, one is bound to stamp it as untrue to 
life, and vulgar. The habit of judging by vul- 
gar averages leads on to a form of cynicism, 
which is ordinarily condoned, in the considera- 
tion of the highest intepreters of life, the philo- 
sophers and poets (pp. 186, 194). Philosophers, 
we are told, " have rarely been noted for practical 
wisdom . ' ' Neither has the midtitude in any other 
walk. But how about Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, 
Leibnitz ? As for the poets, — the pale dubious 
presence of an unnamable renaissance vice " is 
reflected in the sonnets of what is, perhaps, the 
healthiest mind of all time." Fortunately, not 
the average, but the best expositor of Shake- 
peare's Sonnets, Canon Beeching, finds reflected 
in them the lovely sentiment of a David for a 
Jonathan, something, humanly speaking, like the 
friendship disclosed in the twenty-first chapter of 
the Fourth Gospel. 

These bits of worldly wisdom on scholars, 
married life, philosophers, and the like, are, of 
course, obiter dicta, bearing but a fractional 
proportion to the whole work ; yet it would be 
too much to expect that their animus does not 
impair the tone of an otherwise welcome narra- 
tive. Judged by an average standard, Mr. 
Boulting's " Tasso and His Times " is a read- 
able book, full of interesting history and bio- 
graphical information with which few will be 
likely to quarrel. The author seems to know 
his Italy well at first hand, and there is no 
question of his ability to imagine himself in the 



historical backgi'ound that he describes, or of 
his sympathy for his central figure, Tasso. His 
book is wi'itten in what is often a vivacious style, 
suffering, it is true, from frequent overloading 
of detail in an effort to heap up incidents that 
are picturesque, and marred now and then by 
the pathetic fallacy (as on page 1) in descriptions 
of external nature ; yet bound to be considered 
the foremost work on the subject in English — 
until someone with a better understanding for 
scholarship and its relation to all forms of lit- 
erature, including poetry and popular biography, 
shall appear in America or Great Britain, to 
unite his own researches, painful and circum- 
spect, with the labors of Continental authorities 
on Tasso, and to illumine the whole with that 
optimistic and humanizing spirit which is the 
true effulgence of scholarship, philosophy, and 
poetry. 

Something remains to be said about the 
externals of the volume. The printing is gen- 
erally so accurate that a slip on the title-page 
(Simondi for Sismondi) is almost as annoying 
as the misquotation from Wordsworth at the 
bottom of page 137. The twenty-four illus- 
trations, beginning with the Uffizi portrait of 
Tasso and ending with " Tasso's Oak " on 
page 302, are nothing less than admirable. 
The book is well worth having if only for the 
pictures. 

Allowance made for the sort of faults which 
I have tried to suggest, it is well worth having 
in any case. Its merits are more obvious, and 
do not seem to demand an extended rehearsal. 
It is unquestionably opportune.

Readers who delight in curious and out-of-the-way 
knowledge will enjoy the two volumes of the Grafton 
Historical Series (Grafton Press), "Old Steamboat 
Days on the Hudson " by Mr. David Lear Buckman, 
and " In Olde New York " by Mr. Charles Burr Todd. 
They are small books, well made and illustrated. The 
former gives a detailed history of navigation on the 
Hudson, begiiming with a sketch of Robert Fulton and 
his invention of the steamboat, his monopoly and its 
downfall through the famous decision of the Supreme 
Court in the case of Gibbons vs. Ogden. The author 
traces the improvement of the boats, with their names 
and those of their captains, up to the great passenger 
steamers of the present day. The many pictures of these 
boats are perhaps the most interesting feature of the 
book. Mr. Todd's volume consists of a collection of 
sketches and articles, most of them written many 
years ago. They deal with curious matters of the past 
that have been swept away by the rush of modern 
business and improvement. Among the twenty-five 
papers we note " The Old City Dock," " Some Old 
Booksellers," "The Old Jumel Mansion," "Johnson 
Hall," etc.

Mr. Hewlett is nothing if not versatile, and it 
should be no surprise to his readers to discover that 
his new novel is an English tale of the Regency 
period, and that it reproduces the life of England a 
hundred years ago with extraordinary vividness and 
verisimilitude. "The Stooping Lady" is its title, 
and the heroine thus described is a truly adorable 
creature. She stoops indeed, but only to conquer, 
and the mesalliance to which she condescends se- 
cures her in the affections of every reader of generous 
impulses, although it horrifies her own aristocratic 
circle. For Ladj^ Hermia, brought from a girlhood 
spent in Irish wilds to shine in London society, and 
eventually to make a match suitable to her station 
and lineage, looks coldly upon all the noble gentle- 
men who sue for her hand, and bestows her favor 
upon a young man good to look at, but a butcher by 
trade and a radical by political bent. This marvel 
results from his good luck in becoming the victim 
of gross injustice at the hands of her family, and 
thereby attracting the attention and winning the 
commiseration of the heroine. From the sympathy 
thus stirred to the love later awakened is but a step, 
and her capitulation is the consequence of a siege 
carried on by absurdly simple means. For some 
months the hero keeps entirely out of her sight, but 
all the more in her mind because of the bunch of 
white violets he sends her daily, no matter where 
she may be. The cumulative effect proves irresist- 
ible ; and when she makes surrender, it is complete. 
Then tragedy intervenes, and a chance pistol shot 
puts an end to the man's life and the woman's hap- 
piness. We are unprepared for this consummation, 
and it seems rather wanton ; probably the author 
believed it necessary to give artistic completeness to 
Lady Hermia's experience and to his delineation of 
her character. We need hardly add that this story 
has a distinction that sets it far apart from fiction 
in the ordinary sense, and insures for it something 
like permanence in our literature.

the same place among our novelists as was occupied 
a few years ago by Heniy Seton Merriman. He 
has much the same neatness of technique, the same 
versatility, and the same constructive ability. One 
may take up almost any of his later books with the 
assurance that it will offer agreeable entertainment 
by means of a logically coherent narrative, and will 
be found almost wholly free from surplusage. His 
latest novel, " The Broken Road," has for its scene 
one of the smaller protected States of India, and for 
its main subject a native uprising which seems to 
threaten, on a small scale, a repetition of the horrors 
of the Mutiny. The hereditary prince of this State 
is a young man who has been sent to England as a 
child, and educated at Eton and Oxford. He has 
acquired the veneer of European culture, and tries 
to think of himself as an Englishman. But when 
he returns to India, he learns, with much bittterness 
of soul, the lesson of his racial inferiority. Having 
fallen in love with an Englishwoman (who has 
rather encouraged his advances), he discovers that 
his aspirations make him an object of derision, — 
that a " nigger," though he be a prince, must know 
his place. Thereupon he becomes once more an 
Oriental, and enlists as the leader of the fanatical 
agitators who are fomenting rebellion against English 
rule. The plan fails, and he is driven into exile; 
but it provides us with some exciting moments. Mr. 
Mason's work is fairly comparable with that of Mr. 
Kipling and Mrs. Steel in the same field, and has 
the same essential message — the teaching that the 
Asiatic can no more change his nature than the 
leopard his spots, and that the European can never 
understand his actions because he can never appre- 
ciate the motives from which they spring. 

The eccentric-pathetic type of character, projected 
into modern literature by Cervantes, has been illus- 
trated for us more than once by the inventions of 
Mr. Quiller-Couch. We may again find it exempli- 
fied, in a very humble way, in the titular character 
of his " Major Vigoureux," This faithful old soldier, 
after the wars are over, is placed in charge of a 
military post on one of the Channel Islands. For 
years all goes well, and then he is dealt a blow in 
the shape of an official order withdrawing the gar- 
rison and dismantling the battery. He himself is 
not included in the order, and so he remains at his 
post and upon the pay-roll of the War Office, but 
the glory has departed from his life, and he is all 
the time haunted by a miserable suspicion that his 
retention in the service is only an oversight, and that 
he may be turned adrift at any moment. This is a 
suggestion of his character, and this is the situation 
which we find at the beginning of his story as Mr. 
Quiller-Couch has related it for us. Many things 
happen as the story goes on, and they prove well 
worth the chronicling, but we will not attempt to set 
them forth. The author's capricious fancy and rich 
humor are familiar to all his readers, whom we are 
content to notify that " Major Vigoureux " is fully 
as entertaining and human a book as any of the long 
series of its predecessors.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



We had occasion to bestow cordial praise, some 
months ago, upon a novel of Southern life entitled 
"The Invisible Bond." It now appears that the 
author, Miss Eleanor Talbot Kinkead, planned the 
book as the first section of a trilogy having for its 
purpose the presentation of " the three great funda- 
mental relations of life." The relation of man 
toward woman was its theme, and the action revolved 
about a case of divorce. The relation of man toward 
humanity and the relation of the individual toward 
the divine were the two themes left to be portrayed 
by concrete examples in the remaining sections of 
the trilogy. The first of these two is now dealt 
with in "The Courage of Blackburn Blair," a modern 
instance of moral heroism brought into close relations 
with the Goebel campaign that convulsed Kentucky 
a few years ago. The hero is a young lawyer and 
politician who realizes how false is that conception 
of personal honor which in Kentucky, and in the 
South generally, requires a man who is insulted to 
commit a murder for the vindication of his character. 
Early in the narrative he voices his protest against 
the iniquity of this unwritten social law, and says 
that the man who should dare to brave it " would be 
a saviour to his people." The words are of prophetic 
import, for Blackburn Blair is himself destined to be 
put to the test, and when it comes, his conscience 
triumphs over the exactions of the code and he bears 
patiently the resulting imputation of cowardice. It 
is hard to endure the political disfavor and the social 
ostracism that are his immediate reward ; it is harder 
still to discover that his restraint causes the girl 
he loves to shrink from him. But in the end he 
gives convincing proof that he is no coward, and 
some dim notion of the splendid moral heroism he 
has shown throughout becomes perceptible even to 
the minds of his enemies. The fine idealism of this 
book, to say nothing of its many other admirable 
qualities, gives it a high place among the novels of 
the year. 

"The Jessop Bequest," by Miss Anna Robeson 
Burr, offers a case of conscience. The case is a 
perfectly clear one, for it is nothing less than the 
retention by the heroine of a fortune that really 
belongs to a philanthropic society. It all hangs upon 
the date upon which the heroine's mother died. By 
means of trickery and false affidavits the date is set 
a few days ahead, and the fortune diverted to the 
daughter. We should say at once that the heroine 
knows nothing of this, and that the fraud is charge- 
able to the leading politician of the town (who wishes 
to marry the girl) with the connivance of her grand- 
father, an amiable clergyman of weak character and 
wobbly morals. When the heroine learns the facts, 
she at once renounces the personal benefits of her 
fortune, and insists that her grandfather shall make 
restitution. Since he has already squandered a con- 
siderable part of the property, he cannot meet her 
demand at once, and pleads for time. This device 
permits the story to run on long enough for the 
heroine to win fame as an artist, and long enough 
also for the development of the somewhat anaemic 



love interest. It is a well-written story in point of 
style, but exhibits a low degree of vitality, and is 
burdened with much inconsequential detail. 

Miss Elizabeth Robins (Mrs. Parkes) is an accom- 
plished novelist whose work we have often praised ; 
but we cannot congratulate her upon " The Convert," 
which is not a novel in any real sense, but a hyster- 
ical tract in advocacy of woman's suffrage. We do 
not object to a certain amount of veiled didacticism 
in a work of fiction, but in this case zeal gets the 
better of discretion, and the book is as much an 
offence against literai*y good manners as are the 
actions of the " suffragettes " which it defends an 
offence against every sane ideal of social seemliness. 
The mark of the fanatic is upon every page, and 
nothing that might be called " sweet reasonableness " 
is anywhere apparent. The cause that needs to be 
espoused in such fashion as this in order to attract 
attention is in a bad way indeed. 

A struggle for the control of a railway company, 
the abduction of a magnate who is held untU he 
comes to terms, the kidnapping of a boy, a train 
robbery, and a mysterious Chinese episode, are a few 
of the matters which engage our attention in " The 
Lion's Share," Miss Alice French's new novel. To 
these, the San Francisco earthquake is added as an 
effective climax. We do not pretend to understand 
what the story is all about, or just how its episodes 
and characters are related, but we can testify to its 
possession of an interest which is continuous if not 
coherent. The author, who can be a real novelist 
when she tries, would be the last person in the world 
to expect us to take this preposterous invention seri- 
ously. Its purpose is entertainment of the lightest 
sort, and this it gives us in full measure. 

We have previously had occasion to speak in 
terms of praise concerning Mr. Harold Bindloss, 
both for his skill in combining romantic sentiment 
with a rather grim sort of , actuality, and for the 
freshness of interest imparted to his novels by the 
unworked field to which they take us — the Canadian 
Northwest. " The Mistress of Bonaventure " is the 
latest of these novels to come to our attention, 
although it would seem to be a reprint of an earlier 
work. Again we have pictured the hard life of the 
English settler in his struggle with cold winters and 
hot summers and crop failures and prairie fires and 
relentless usurers. In the present instance, the usurer 
is the chief source of the woes that come upon the 
hero, who is both stripped of his possessions and 
falsely accused of crime by his implacable enemy. 
The heroine is the daughter of a capitalist who owns 
the neighboring Bonaventure ranch, and, although 
reared in luxury, is the sort of young woman who 
can recognize genuine manhood beneath the roughest 
of exteriors. These being the conditions, the logi- 
cal outcome is evident enough. Disaster does not 
daunt our hei'o-farmer, and in the end his enemy 
makes a hasty escape over the border, while the 
coming of the railway brings assured prosperity to 
the man who had been so nearly down and out. It 
is a stirring story of real men and women, full of 



1908.]

incident, and fairly well written, although the style 
is now and then disfigured by a slovenly touch. 

A second exploiter of this same field is Mr. 
Herman Whitaker, whose story of "The Settler" 
again tells the struggle of man with nature in a 
western Canadian province. The hero in this case 
is a very rough diamond indeed, and a variation of 
the usual framework of these stories is offered by 
the fact that he wins the heroine early in the narra- 
tive instead of at the close. Presently she becomes 
discontented with the hard conditions of her life, and 
a separation follows, which keeps the two apart for 
a long time. Meanwhile, the husband has a hard 
time of it, but stakes everything upon the construc- 
tion of a branch railway, which he finally succeeds 
in building despite the desperate opposition of the 
Canadian Pacific. Then his own stubbornness and 
his wife's pride relax sufiiciently to bring about a 
reunion. As compared with Mr. Bindloss, the pres- 
ent novelist has a more animated manner and a 
greater flexibility of style, besides having a keener 
eye for dramatic effect. 

The heroine of "The Crucible," by Mr. Mark 
Lee Luther, is a child who in a fit of passion attacks 
her sister with the first convenient weapon, inflicting 
a slight wound. For this outburst of temper, her 
unnatural mother has the child taken to court and 
sentenced to a three years' terra in the State Refor- 
matory. There we find her when the story opens, 
suUen and resentful, condemned to menial tasks, long- 
ing for the open fields from which the gray walls 
keep her. Yet the discipline imposed upon her is 
what she most needs, and the institution is the cruci- 
ble for the refining of her character. When freed, 
she becomes a shop-girl in New York, but her past 
comes up against her, and she is brought to desperate 
straits. Finally, the fairy prince appears, a young 
artist who had befriended her in her reformatory 
days, and whose memory she has ever since cher- 
ished. They are married, but she fails to tell him 
of a certain episode in her shop-girl days — an inno- 
cent affair, but one that might seem suspicious — 
and when that comes out, their happiness nearly 
suffers shipwreck. The story offers little more than 
a variation of a few well-worn themes, but the action 
moves rapidly from point to point, and the dramatic 
effects are skilfully contrived. 

The religious and aesthetic charlatan is pictured 
for us in " Comrade John," the latest joint effort of 
Messrs. Merwin and Webster. His name is Herman 
Stein, and he derives, in about equal parts, from 
Zion and East Am-ora. His colony has a home 
somewhere in the hUl country of New York, and its 
imposing array of staff and stucco architecture is 
enhanced by the natural beauty of lakes and cas- 
cades and mountains. All this is the work of 
Comrade John, a creative genius who has hitherto 
been employed in the designing of amusement parks, 
and who is engaged by Stein for the construction of 
Beechcroft, one of the conditions being that the 
designer shall pose as a disciple and conform to the 
customs of the colony. The acceptance of this con- 



dition makes Comrade John out of the man who 
under his true name has a national reputation. 
Like most prophets of his stripe. Stein has" an eye 
for womankind, and he contrives to get a beautiful 
and credulous girl into his toils. She is to be a sort 
of high priestess of the new religion, and incidentally, 
when Stein shall have divorced his present wife, she 
is to marry him. The story is mainly concerned 
with the rescue of this girl by the architect, who 
falls in love with her, opens her eyes to the whole 
miserable imposture, and exposes the prophet to his 
deluded followers. The story ends with a series of 
hurried escapes, the lovers fleeing in one direction, 
and the charlatan in another. It is a highly amus- 
ing tale, told with much spirit, and with a delectable 
fertility of humorous invention. 

Mr. Harben's homely tales of life in Georgia are 
always pleasing in design, and his character-sketches 
bear the stamp of faithful observation. He knows 
his own people, negio and white, and they offer him 
a variety of types quite sufficient for his needs as a 
novelist. The negro figures quite prominently in 
"Mam' Linda," his latest novel, which is, in fact, 
essentially a presentation of one aspect of what we 
are apt to call the negro problem without having 
much idea of the exact nature of that problem. In 
this story a negro boy is wrongfully accused of crime, 
and the passions of his pursuers are so inflamed 
against him that his case seems desperate. But he 
has a friend in the hero, a young lawyer, who knows 
the boy to be innocent, and who risks his profes- 
sional and political career by his championship. It 
seems to him that the good name of the community 
and the very cause of Southern civilization are at 
stake in this affair, and his fine impersonal stand 
eventually wins for him the safety of the boy, the 
suffrage of his fellow-citizens, and the love of the 
heroine — a reasonably adequate return for his 
efforts. The author by no means looks at the negro 
through rose-tinted glasses, but he understands him, 
which is more to the point, and his attitude is typical 
of the humane element in Southern society, called 
upon to grapple at first hand with a problem of which 
we, at this comfortable distance, cannot realize either 
the complication or the menace. 

Mr. Herbert Quick's "Double Trouble," that 
ingenious tale of dual personality, leads us to 
open " The Broken Lance " with pleasant anticipa- 
tions. Nor are we disappointed, as far as plan and 
style are concerned, for the author knows how to 
write, and his eye for dramatic effect is keen. But we 
must confess to a considerable disappointment when 
we discover that the book is not so much a novel as 
an argument for the single tax. The leading char- 
acter is a clergyman so easily swayed by his emotions 
that a single reading of "Progress and Poverty" 
suffices to overturn his whole fabric of ideas over- 
night. With more zeal than discretion, he proceeds 
to expound the new gospel the next time he enters 
the pulpit (the greater part of the sermon is given 
us), and horrifies his hearers by his plain language 
about what he conceives to be the tainted sources of

quence?, slowly unfolded, are that he becomes an 
outcast from the church, his wife divorces him, he 
is made the subject of an atrocious scandal, and 
becomes a noisy labor agitator, meeting his death 
in the riot that accompanies a teamsters' strike in 
Chicago. The author's earnestness compels a certain 
amount of sympathy even for so ill-balanced a hero 
as this, but he overdoes his denunciation of society, 
and can see nothing but greed and corruption where 
the clearer vision can clearly discern a preponderating 
element of integrity and philanthropical dealing.

Briefs on Neiiv Books. 

The art of ^^' ^- ^- Farrer's "Literary For- 

uterary geries " (Longmans) is an account of 

for aery. some of the most celebrated impos- 

tures by which human credulity has been victimized. 
That is to say, it is a record of the detected impos- 
tures ; the reader has an uneasy feeling that the 
undetected might require a larger volume. If 
intelligent people in relatively critical periods could 
be all but completely deceived — but why pursue so 
painful a reflection ? In the face of their victims' 
credulity, one marvels at the moderation of these 
clever deceivers. The trutli seems to be that human- 
ity has been protected from worse deception not so 
much by its own discernment. as by the impostors' 
failure to be quite clever enough. There is nearly 
always in their position a weak point that they over- 
look. That is, there is such a point in the position 
of those who are detected. One thing we may be 
quite clear about, namely, that hardly any degree 
of scholarship, fertility, and literary power, in a sus- 
pected work, is sufficient to warrant its authenticity. 
Nor is the absence of apparent motive for deception 
of any avail. The very ability to perform the trick 
seems to be motive enough. In other words, the 
art of literary forgery is an art like another, with 
its own inspirations, temerities, and rewards. And 
if an honest man like Scott could look upon the art 
without severe disapproval, we can hardly exact a 
higher moral standard of the artists themselves. 
But, as in the case of other indications of human 
frailty, it is probably well not to regard this with too 
severe a countenance. Certainly, it has its amusing 
side. The spectacle of Boswell, flown with brandy 
and water, kneeling before the Shakespeare forgery 
of Ireland, reverently kissing "the invaluable relics 
of our bard " and thanking God that he has lived to 
see them, is not without humor ; but we confess that 
the thought of the great geometrician and astrono- 
mer, Chasles, accepting without a qualm letters 
written in the French language by Plato, Cleopatra, 
Lazarus, and Mary Magdalene, strikes us as more 
painful than amusing. Mr. Farrer deals with the 
Letters of Phalaris ^nd Trimalchio's Supper, 



Simonides's Biblical and patristic forgeries, the 
amazing career of Psalmanazar, the Eikon Basilik^, 
the false Decretals and the Donation of Constantine, 
the Rowley poems, Lauder's attack on Milton, the 
famous Shelley letters to which Browning wrote an 
introduction, the shameful letters ascribed to Marie 
Antoinette, Ireland's Vortigern and Rowena and 
other Shakespearian frauds, various ballad forgeries, 
and the spurious novels of Scott. Mr. Andrew Lang, 
who contributes an introduction to the volume in his 
customary amusing vein, seems half regretful that 
he did not attempt to palm off a baUad of his own 
on Professor Child, to see if that great scholar and 
fine critic was proof against the guile of the forger. 

The early years Though Lafcadio Heam's literary 
and struggles of reputation will not be enhanced by 
a literary artist, the publication of "Letters from the 
Raven" (Brentano's), these unstudied early writ- 
ings give an insight into phases of his personality not 
revealed by what he wrote for the world at large, 
nor, except in small measure, by the numerous private 
letters printed in his " Life and Letters " by Miss 
Elizabeth Bisland. The fii*st ray of light that modi- 
fied the gloom of the period of bitter struggle after 
he was cast off by his relatives came when, at the 
age of nineteen, he made his way to Cincinnati. A 
chance acquaintance with a Scotch printer brought 
him an introduction to Henry Watkin, an English- 
man of broad culture and liberal views, who gave 
Hearn employment as an errand-boy in his printing- 
office, and afterward helped him secure a position 
on the staff of a Cincinnati newspaper. Between the 
two a warm friendship sprang up, which lasted as 
long as Hearn lived. By Watkin he was familiarly 
addressed as " The Raven," and for many years a 
drawing of the bird served as the signature to what- 
ever Hearn wrote to his " Dear Old Dad," as he was 
wont to call him. The bull^ of the correspondence 
is not great. It consists of various whimsical and 
amusing messages, and about two dozen letters, most 
of them written during Hearn's sojourn in New 
Orleans. They abound in half-playful, half-serious 
mention of privations and pleasures, occupations and 
aspirations, and are supplemented by the sympathetic 
running comment of the editor, Mr. Milton Bronner, 
who has fused them into a connected outline of 
Hearn's career. Appended are a number of letters 
to an anonymous lady correspondent, and extracts 
from letters contributed to a Cincinnati newspaper 
under the pseudonym of " Ozias Midwinter." The 
interest that attaches to these utterances is in a way 
pathetic. Unfeeling indeed would be the person who 
could read them and not be touched by the brave 
effort to build up within, while combating adverse 
circumstances without. Two things they serve to 
show. One is an exemplification of the old lesson 
that with rare exceptions patient preparation is the 
necessary prelude to noteworthy performance. The 
other is that with his temperament and physical dis- 
abilities it is most unlikely that under any other con- 
ditions Hearn would have achieved more than he

actually accomplished. His real life was never in 
the sordid present. From early youth until the day 
of his death, the glamour of the unseen was always 
luring him onward. Possibly this meant for him 
a loss in things material, but the spiritual gain is 
gi-eat. 

A teiegrapher^s -^*t«^ ^^^ many books, pamphlets, 
recollections of and magazine articles written about 
the Civil War. Lincoln, one might think that little 
if anything remained to be told. Yet " Lincoln in 
the Telegraph Office " (Century Co.), by Mr. David 
Homer Bates, gives a new view of the great War 
President. Mr. Bates was a telegraph operator in 
the War Department, and saw much of Lincoln, 
who frequently visited the military telegraph office 
in order to get the latest news from the armies. 
The volume under review is made up of articles 
recently published in the Century Magazine, to 
which some padding has been added. Much of the 
book is devoted to what the author saw and heard, 
and much of it to descriptions of and comments 
upon affairs that the author knew no more about 
than the ordinary citizen. The latter part is of 
little value and often unreliable; but the former is 
distinctly good. The scope of the work is broader 
than the title would indicate. It is really a sort of 
history of the military telegraph service at the War 
Department, but it is arranged around Lincoln as a 
central figure. The best of the book describes the 
organization of the military telegraph corps and the 
service of the corps in and near Washington ; and 
through it all runs the binding thread of narrative 
about Lincoln. It is a genuinely fresh treatment 
of a little-known phase of Lincoln's everyday life — 
when he was away from the importunities of politi- 
cians and places-hunters, and, being less harrassed, 
was freer in manner. The account is studded with 
anecdotes, new and old, but all well told ; and here 
and there are new lights upon historical matters, 
such, for example, as the statement (page 108) 
about the suppressed messages and parts of mes- 
sages to and from McClellan. The sketch of Mr. 
Andrew Carnegie's war-time activities is worth 
reading, and the explanation of cipher codes and 
their uses by both Northern and Southern author- 
ities is alone of sufficient interest to justify the 
publication of the book. The illustrations are good. 
Stanton, great and rude, is frequently exhibited in 
a pleasant situation — as in this passage : " He 
invited me to a seat on the greensward, while 
he read the telegrams ; and then, business being 
finished, we began talking of early times in Steuben- 
ville, Ohio, his native town and mine. One of us 
mentioned the game of mumble-the-peg, and he 
asked me if I could play it. Of course I said yes, 
and he proposed that we should have a game then 
and there. Stanton entered into the spirit of the 
boyish sport with great zest, and for the moment 
all the perplexing questions of the terrible war were 
forgotten." It is rather unfortunate that Mr. Bates 
undertakes to deal with matters not related to his 



subject. About a third of the book is padding, inter- 
esting but not always authentic. The sympathies 
of the author do not include many of those who 
were on the other side. On pages 86 and 87, pages 
28 and 29 are repeated — a slip not to be expected 
in a work from the De Vinne Press. 



" There will be no peace in literary 

scholar of repute persists in employ- 
ing any variation in the name of our greatest poet." 
So, at least, says Dr. J. L. Haney in the preface to his 
little treatise, " The Name of William Shakespeare " 
(Philadelphia: The Egerton Press). As the title 
indicates. Dr. Haney is an advocate of the form 
almost universally adopted by the publishers of the 
quartos and folios. He belongs, therefore, not to 
the ranks of " manuscript-men," in Dr. Furnivall's 
phrase, but to the "second-banders — charming 
fellows, some of them, but too fond of type." As is 
well known. Dr. Furnivall is a staunch upholder of 
the so-called Stratford spelling, Shakspere, based 
upon the five signatures of the poet ; though he him- 
self concedes that of these only one is certainly 
Shakspere. As for the Stratford origin of this 
form, there is the same variation in the local records 
as there apparently is in the signatures. At this 
point it may not be amiss to remark that three of 
Dr. Haney's transcriptions of the Stratford records 
differ from those of Halliwell-Phillipps and Lambert 
(Shakespeare Documents). This is only one indi- 
cation of the great difficulty of an inquiry the results 
of which may be nullified at any moment by a slight 
error of eye or hand. Dr. Haney takes into account, 
besides the Stratford Registers and the title-pages 
of early editions, contemporary documents and allu- 
sions, the Stationers' Registers, and the usage of 
modern critics and editors. His summary of the 
" evidence " is as follows : " We find that the name 
occurred originally in numerous variant forms ; that 
at Stratford the spelling Shakspere prevailed for a 
time, though rarely after the beginning of the 
dramatist's career ; that the Stationers' Registers and 
other contemporary documents present a wilderness 
of confusing variations ; that although four of the 
five autographs seem intended to spell Shakspere, 
the title-pages of the quartos and of the First Folio 
point more strongly to the form Shakespeare. If the 
usage of later scholars and critics is of less weight, 
it is at least noteworthy that the recent editors and 
biographers who have specialized most zealously 
upon the study of the poet are virtually unanimous 
for the longer spelling." 



A Yankee

in France. 



To the average American tourist, all 
Gaul consists of Paris, and Paris of 
Notre Dame, the Louvre, and the 
Moulin Rouge. That there is any home-life more 
sacred than that portrayed in the yellow-covered

concern himself to suspect ; stiU less does he know 
of the universities and the school system bound up

with them, while the religion of France he is satis- 
fied to divide into Roman Catholicism and atheism. 
But the author of " France of Today " ( Scribner) 
is not a mere tourist, for as the incumbent of the 
Hyde lectureship he was taken at once into that 
intimate association which enabled him to see French 
life hidden from the transitory dweller in hotels. 
Natm-ally, Professor Wendell's primary interest is 
in the universities and the school system, and of these 
he gives an exposition which brings out the essential 
differences of the French scheme of education from 
the American. Of French society and the French 
family he writes much as a highly-favored guest 
might discuss the family of his host. Everything 
is so pleasantly said that one is tempted to make 
allowances on the score of courtesy. Still, it is all 
very interesting, and in the face of much that is said 
and more that is thought to the contrary it is 
refreshing to see the golden side of the shield. This 
leads naturally to the question " why the life of 
modern France, when you come to know it, seems so 
different from the same life as set forth in the most 
highly developed literature of modern Europe." 
Notwithstanding the convention that surrounds the 
French woman, the intellectual candor of the French 
people which permits them to discuss topics forbid- 
den among ourselves, and the fact that literature 
must concern itself with interesting exceptions to 
the commonplace — such being Professor Wendell's 
answers to his question, — one is yet forced to the 
conclusion that back of this literature is a life which 
the favored guest would not see among the respec- 
table families of his cultured hosts. Literature can 
spring only from life, and French literature is too vital 
to reflect only rare though remarkable exceptions. 

Memorials of ^^ ^"^^^ ™«^e was Thomas Davidson 
a wandering the man and teacher than Thomas 
scholar. Davidson the writer, that a book 

about him is likely to impart far more of his peculiar 
quality than a book by him. Most welcome, there- 
fore, is the volume of " Memorials of Thomas 
Davidson, the Wandering Scholar" (Ginn & Co.), 
collected and edited by his fellow-countryman. 
Professor William Knight, who four years ago 
printed a short account of him in " Some Nineteenth- 
Century Scotsmen." Born in 1 840 and dying in 
1900, Davidson crowded into his too-short life an 
amount of learning, lecturing, restless roaming, 
teaching and writing that is, all told, nothing short 
of stupendous. By one who knew him well he was 
counted "as within the circle of the twelve most 
learned men in the world," yet he carried his load of 
erudition so lightly and was so little stationary in his 
mode of life, and so invariably at leisure to welcome 
friends or acquaintances or even strangers seeking 
his counsel, that comparatively few thought of or 
even suspected those stores of knowledge which he 
never seemed to sit stUl long enough to amass, much 
less to digest. Extraordinary intellectual alertness 
and a wonderful memory must explain the mystery. 
At home in all languages whose literatures had any- 



thing to offer him, he once puzzled a Frenchman, a 
German, and an Italian, by engaging all three in a 
discussion and responding to each in his own tongue 
with so faultless an accent that each claimed him 
as a feUow-countryman. This many-sidedness may 
account for some of the varying and even contradic- 
tory impressions that he seems to have made on 
different friends. In Professor Knight's volume one 
friend calls him " a Platonizer," another " a devout 
Aristotelian," one describes him as holding Kant in 
small esteem, and another declares that " he always 
spoke with reverence of Kant." These recollections 
of friends and disciples, with extracts from his letters 
and other writings, combine to portray, roughly and 
l>y suggestion, an inspiring and astonishingly versa- 
tile character ; but a complete and consistent account 
of the man, if such be possible, is yet to be written. 

In " The True Story of My Life " 
irZX*. life. (John Lane), by Mrs. Alice Mangold 

Diehl, we have one of those discursive 
autobiographies of non-famous persons which chron- 
icle an immense amount of unimportant private 
history and must rely chiefly on their realism for 
their charm. And yet the author probably deserves 
to be better known in America for her useful and 
industrious career in music and literature. A pianist 
of considerable repute in London during the sixties 
and seventies, she later became a prolific novelist 
and poured forth a flood of fiction which generally 
found friendly publishers and a host of readers. As 
a precocious child, she was taken to Germany and 
became a pupU of Adolf Henselt, whose genius and 
eccentricities she describes in an interesting way. 
After a successful debut in Paris at the age of 
seventeen, she returned to her native England ; and 
the narrative from this point is simply the detailed 
record of a brave and unflagging struggle to care 
for her growing family. There are apparently no 
reserves in the story : her mother's imperiousness, 
her husband's foibles, her own failures and triumphs 
in fighting off the " wolf," are recorded with such 
fidelity that we seem to be turning the pages of a 
diary. Naturally, a long and semi-public life in and 
near London brought Mrs. Diehl more or less in 
contact with the great ones of literature and art ; 
and her pages show us interesting glimpses of Sir 
Henry Irving, Lord Leighton, Antoinette Sterling, 
the baritone Santley, and other celebrities of the 

time. 

Corporations In '' The Federal Power over Car- 
r^rPXa. riersandCorporations"(Macmillan) 
Constitution. Mr. E. Parmalee Prentice combats 
what he calls " a most dangerous and mistaken 
notion " — that new meanings must be given to the 
Constitution merely because present questions are 
beyond the contemplation of the statesmen of a cen- 
tury ago. The work is historical and legal in its 
method, and shows much patient research among 
early statutes and a carefully critical reading of 
many cases ; but while the method and the temper- 
ate language employed give the impression of a calm

and judicious mind, the effect is marred by frequent 
unmistakable evidences of bias. Indeed, the main 
purpose of the book would seem to be to oppose as 
unconstitutional the proposal of Mr. Garfield, in his 
first report as Commissioner of Corporations, that 
companies engaging in interstate commerce should 
be licensed by the Federal Government; for the 
author regards Federal license as a violation of the 
freedom of trade among the States. The careful 
student who realizes how easily opposite conclusions 
can be drawn from the same decision of the Supreme 
Court will make note of Mr. Prentice's citations and 
read at least some of the epoch-making decisions for 
himself. To such a student the volume will prove 
a very convenient introduction to the subject.

A book for z-wpii i jjj 

bepinners in lege, Oxford, has recently added 
Welsh history, another volume to his Celtic studies 
in the form of " A Short History of Wales " 
( University of Chicago Press) . The book is written 
for " those who have never read any Welsh history 
before," and for such readers it no doubt has its 
value. In so brief a work, a connected narrative of 
course becomes impossible ; only the most prominent 
events and episodes can be treated or even men- 
tioned. The author's point of view is that of a 
Welshman who believes in the perpetuation of Celtic 
nationality in custom, speech, and literatm-e, but not 
in Welsh political independence beyond a certain 
measure of administrative autonomy. The story is 
told in a simple, straightforward, but interesting 
fashion, which would make it easier reading were it 
not for the author's puristic ideas in the matter of 
proper names. It ought to be possible to anglicize 
Welsh names and terms to a slight extent — at 
least to write them with such vowels and consonants 
as produce a pronounceable combination in English ; 
to the reader who has never read Welsh history 
before, combinations like Clwyd, Gwledig, and 
Cynddelw are not very intelligible. 



Notes. 



We have not had a new " Temple Primer " for some 
time. An addition to the series is now made in the 
shape of a little book on " Sick Nursing," by Mr. H. 
Drinkwater. 

Among the enterprises comprised imder the general 
title of " The Shakespeare Library " (Duffield) is an 
edition of the plays in the spelling of the best quarto and 
folio texts. The first play to be published in this " Old- 
Spelling Shakespeare " is " Loues Labors Lost," edited 
by Dr. F. J. Fumivall. 

An event of interest to book lovers and collectors is 
the sale, at auction, of some eight hundred old English 
books, including scarce and valuable works on Ireland, 
on early printing, etc. Catalogues may be had by 
addressing the Williams, Barker & Severn Co., 187 
Wabash avenue, Chicago. 

A small volume of Character Portraits from Dickens," 
by Mr. Charles Welsh, gives us brief summaries, with 



references for further information, of about one hmidred 
and fifty of the characters that have their being in the 
world of the novelist's creation. It is published by 
Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. 

A series of books entitled " On American Holidays " 
has been planned by Messrs. Moffat, Yard, & Co., and 
the first volume, " Christmas," edited by Mr. Robert 
Haven Sehauffler, is now ready. It is essentially a book 
of selections, in verse and prose, relating to the origin, 
celebration, and significance of the day. 

The important monograph on " The Inheritance Tax," 
by Mr. Max West, much revised and enlarged from its 
original form, is issued from the Columbia University 
Press. This form of taxation is very much "in the 
air " just at present, and it is well to know what other 
countries have done with it. Mr. West's discussion is 
both historical and theoretical, and is a very thorough 
piece of work. 

From the Cambridge University Press (Macmillan) 
comes an edition of " The Poems of WilUam Dunbar," 
edited, with the necessary apparatus (considerable m 
this case), by Mr. H. Belly se Baildon. This is a pub- 
lication that scholars will welcome, since the earlier 
editions " are now all difficult and costly to procure," 
while this one is compact and inexpensive, besides em- 
bodying the best modern scholarship. 

A new edition of George Palmer Putnam's " Tabular 
Views of Universal History," continued to date by 
Messrs. Lynde E. Jones and Simeon Strunsky, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. Thi^ chrono- 
logical conspectus of the world's history, with its useful 
arrangement in parallel columns, is of great value to both 
teachers and students, and in its present modernized 
form, should find its career of helpfidness considerably 
prolonged. 

" The Modern Reader's Bible," as now published by 
the Macmillan Co. for Professor R. G. Moulton, repre- 
sents what may be taken as a fairly definitive form of 
a work that has had various earlier appearances, and 
to which the editor has devoted a large part of his life. 
The text is that of the Revised Version, with modifica- 
tions. Printed upon thin paper, the volume contains 
nearly eighteen hundred pages, and is not unwieldy at 
that. 

Sir George Trevelyan, browsing among the books of 
Macaulay, has foimd so much entertainment in the mar- 
ginal notes with which they are plentifully provided that 
he has thought it worth while to take the public into his 
confidence. The result is a little book entitled " Mar- 
ginal Notes by Lord Macaulay," which affords delightful 
reading of the chatty sort, and leaves us with the wish 
that there were much more of it. Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. are the pubhshers. 

Three new volumes are added by the Oliver Ditson 
Co. to their " Musicians' Library." One of them is the 
first volume of a " Bach Piano Album," edited by Mr. 
Ebenezer Prout. It includes shorter compositions only 
— preludes, dances, inventions, symphonies, and suites — 
to the number of about fifty. Another of the volumes 
is devoted to Haydn, and contains twenty compositions 
for piano, eleven of them being sonatas. It is edited by 
Mr. Xaver Scharwenka. The third volume, edited by 
Mr. Carl Armbruster, gives us " Wagner Lyrics for 
Baritone and Bass." All the music-dramas are rep- 
resented, excepting " Rienzi," and we have in addition 
two early ballads, " Der Tannenbaum " and " Die Beiden 
Grenadiere."

English Poems — The Nineteenth Century 

Professor of English Literature in Brown University. 
This new collection of English poems is in many respects an advance on any yet produced. The aim has been to satisfy the needs of 
the student and reader of the present day, and to this end every effort has been made to supply in the commentary just the needed in- 
formation and interpretation. 635 pages, 12mo, cloth ; library edition, net $1.50, postpaid $1.68 ; school edition, net $1., postpaid Sl.15. 

The Tragedies of Seneca Translated by frank justus miller 

This is a new translation of the ten tragedies which have come down under the name of Seneca, rendered into English blank verse, 
with appropriate lyric metres for the choruses. The work is enriched and its value greatly enhanced for both classical and English 
students, as well as for the general reader, by an introduction on the influence of the tragedies of Seneca upon early English drama, 
contributed to the volume by Professor John M. Manly ; also by a review of the Roman historical drama in connection with the 
Octavia, by comparative analyses of Seneca's tragedies and the corresponding Greek dramas, and by a comprehensive mythological 
index and glossary. 548 pages, 8vo. cloth ; net $3.00, postpaid $3.20. 

Ancient Italy Historical and Geographical Investigations in Central Italy, Magna 
Graecia, Sicily, and Sardinia By ettore pais 

^ Translated from the Italian by C. DENSMORE CURTIS 

Dr. Pais is well known to classical scholars. The articles in the present volume are the results of his studies in the ancient history 
of the Italian tribes. Every available source of information is drawn upon, and their breadth of view is masterly. They embrace 
the relations of these peoples with the surrounding nations, and Incidentally throw light on the history of Greece. Their publica- 
tion at this time will be welcomed by scholars, to whom they have never been generally accessible. Many of them were printed as 
detached papers with a limited circulation, and all were of course in Italian. 460 pages, 8vo, cloth ; net $5.00, postpaid $5.24. 



Chapters in Rural Progress 



By KENYON L. BUTTERFIELD 

The increasing devotion to rural matters, springing from the renewed interest in outdoor life, and now including the technical 
aspects of modern agriculture, is gradually being broadened to embrace the field of economic and social investigations. At present 
the literature regarding the sociological phases of rural life is particularly meagre. President Butterfield's book emphasizes the 
social aspects of rural communities and describes some of the newer movements resulting in the expansion of country life. 276 pages,

Barnes, Earl. WHERE KNOWLEDGE FAILS. 12mo, 

cloth, 50 cents net ; by mail. 55 cents. 

From the pen of a scientific thinker, one whose attitude is lib- 
eral yet reverent, presenting the outlines of a belief in which the 
relations of knowledge and faith are clearly established. While 
his platform is certain to be seriously challenged, it is neverthe- 
less true that many will find in it a solution of the most important 
problem present-day men and women have to cope with. 

Bishop. Emily M. SEVENTY YEARS YOUNG. 12mo, 

board sides, cloth back, $1.20 net ; by mail, $1.27. 

Advocating ever-new expression in thought and deed, the 
avoidance of ruts in thinking and feeling, and preaching healthy 
optimism, the book will keep body and mind young. 

Dr. G. Stanley Hall says: "I read it through with interest 
and great pleasure. It is timely and practical."

MARGIN. 12mo, cloth, 50 cents net ; by mail, 55 cents. 
His theme is the problem of utilizing the time one has to 
spend as one pleases for the aim of attaining the highest culture 
of mind and spirit. How to work and how to play ; how to read 
and how to study, how to avoid intellectual dissipation and how 
to apply the open secrets of great achievement evidenced in con- 
spicuous lives are among the many phases of the problem which 
the author discusses, earnestly, yet with a light touch.

Lafayette McLaws has woven a story picturesque and 
dramatic, peopled with famous personages and founded

tinction and value. It is panoramic in scope, photo- 
graphic in detail, well put together, and in some of the 
battle scenes remarkably strong and realistic. ... As 
the story progresses there are intimate revelations of 
the great men of the time — Clay and Calhoun, Stephens, 
Lee, Davis. John Brown and the titanic figure of Lincoln,

EDMUND CLA RENC E STEDMAN. 

Bryant and Longfellow and Emerson, then 
Lowell and Holmes and Whittier, then Aldrich, 
only a few months ago, and now Stedman, — 

" They are all gone into the world of light! " 
The last leaf has fallen from the tree, and the 
first great age of American poetry is rounded 
out to its close. Other poets we shall have, with 
other themes to inspire them, but the spiritual 
expression of our nineteenth century, with its 
portentous blossoming of democracy and its 
central tragedy of sectional hatred culminating 
in civil war, is now complete ; the last of the 
poets who knew at first-hand the tremendous 
happenings of haK a century ago, and whose 
song was potent in the cause of righteousness, 
has been laid to rest. And whatever successors ' 
they may have will find it no easy task to earn 
the laurels of such a fame or the tribute of such 
an affection as have been gratefully bestowed 
upon the poets of the group now unrepresented 
by a single survivor. 

Edmund Clarence Stedman was born in 1833, 
in Hartford, Connecticut, and when he died, on 
the eighteenth of last month, was in his seventy- 
fifth year. He was the son of Edmmid Burke 
Stedman and Elizabeth Dodge. He lost his 
father when still a child, and his mother, a 
woman of marked poetical ability, afterwards 
married William B. Kinney, and went to Italy 
to live. The boy was placed in charge of an 
uncle in Norwich, where he lived from the age 
of five to sixteen, and where he was fitted for 
college. This is the town which he afterwards 
celebrated in verse as " The Liland City." 

" Guarded by cii-cling streams and wooded luomitains, 
Like sentinels round a queen, 
Dotted with groves and musical with fountains, 
Tlie city lies serene." 

He entered Yale in 1849, as a member of the 
Class of 1853, but did not complete the course. 
Many years afterward, the University made up 
for the degree then withheld, and bestowed upon 
him her highest academic distinctions. The 
twenty-fifth anniversary of his class evoked from 
him the poem " Meridian," in which his Alma 
Mater is made to ask : 

" Now who have kept my maxims best? 
Who have most nearly held within theii' gi-asp 
The fluttering robe that each essayed to clasp? "

Probably no truer answer to the question has 
been made than that written in the record of 
his own life. 

Returning to Norwich at the age of nineteen, 
he became the editor of a local newspaper, and 
country journalism claimed him for the next four 
years. Then he sought a wider field in New 
York City, which was to be his home for the 
remainder of his life. He joined the staff of 
" The Tribune," and wrote much for the maga- 
zines. He became intimately associated with 
Taylor, Stoddard, Curtis, Winter, Aldrich, and 
Howells. It was for " The Tribune " that he 
wrote the poems that soon made his name widely 
known — "The Diamond Wedding," "The 
Ballad of Lager Bier," and " How Old Brown 
Took Harper's Ferry." The outbreak of the 
Civil War sent him to Washington and the 
front, where he served for two years as special 
correspondent of " The World." Then followed 
a period of law study, during which he acted as 
private secretary to Attorney-General Bates. 
In 1864 he became connected with the work of 
the Union Pacific Railroad, which diverted his 
thoughts from law to finance. This proved to 
be the turning-point of his life, for it brought 
him back to New York, and started him on 
his career as a man of affairs. 

Mr. Stedman went into the brokerage and 
banking business, and in 1869 became a mem- 
ber of the New York Stock Exchange, a fact 
which determined his practical activities for over 
thirty years. This step was taken with his eyes 
wide open, and with the determination that, 
shoidd he become a successful broker, he would 
be none the less a poet — that his business should 
be with him no more than a means to an ideal 
end. In consequence, he became known as the 
" banker-poet," an appellation which he partic- 
idarly resented, because he felt that if a man 
deserved the title of poet at all it should be given 
him without qualification. There is little, in- 
deed, in his poems to indicate that he was a 
shrewd man of affairs, or anything but a devotee 
of the muse. " Pan in Wall Street " and " Israel 
Freyer's Bid for Gold " suggest his days in the 
mart, but they are only the exceptions that prove 
the rule. As a man of business he prospered 
exceedingly for a term of years, and then suf- 
fered reverses which profoundly affected the 
remainder of his career. Although he recov- 
ered, in a measure, from the crisis that had 
nearly swept away his fortune, and survived it 
by a quarter-century, his later life was some- 
thing of a struggle, and his closing years were 
clouded by long seasons of illness and darkened 



by the death of his wife, the gTacious hostess of 
Casa Laura — his country home in Lawrence 
Park. 

His life as a whole, aside from its literary 
aspect, was singularly active and varied. If we 
test him by Goethe's couplet, — 

" Es bildet eiii Taleut sich in der Stille, 
Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt," — 

it is clear that he was plunged in the currents 
of many worldly affairs, and that they shaped 
him into a character of distinctive strength. 
He was active in so many intellectual, artistic, 
political, and social concerns, that their enumer- 
ation would require a considerable paragraph. 
Of them all, we will mention only his effective 
work done with the American Copyright League, 
of which he became the president after Lowell's 
death. But it is particularly curious to note 
that what Goethe meant for an antithesis, a 
contrast of irreconcileables, became in Mr. 
Stedman 's case a synthesis ,' for precisely the 
sort of talent that is the outgrowth of the 
secluded and reflective life, was also his, and he 
produced much delicate literature that might 
be judged, from its internal evidence, to be the 
work of the veriest dreamer. 

Mr. Stedman's work as a man of letters was 
of three distinct kmds — editorial, critical, and 
poetical. As an editor of the writings of others, 
his work waS done with remarkable learning and 
discretion, and exhibited just those qualities of 
judgment and good taste that were to be expected 
from a poet and critic of his high rank. His 
monuments in this department are the edition of 
Poe (in conjunction with Professor Woodberry), 
the " Library of American Literature " (with 
the collaboration of Miss Hutchinson), and the 
two Anthologies, " Victorian " and " American." 
In each of these cases, the work was so sym- 
pathetically and thoroughly done that better 
performances were with difficulty imaginable. 
Time will call for an extension of the Library 
and the Anthologies, but it will hardly bring 
an improvement upon the treatment of the mat- 
ter within their scope. 

The main body of Mr. Stedman's critical 
writing is comprised within three volumes. The 
" Victorian Poets " (1875) contains essays that 
had been slowly built up into their permanent 
form during a number of years preceding their 
collective publication. When the volume ap- 
peared it was at once recognized, in both 
America and England, as a masterly produc- 
tion, as the most important systematic work of 
literary criticism that America had produced. 
Ten years later appeared the companion volimie 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

on " Poets of America," an even richer and 
riper work. When the TurnbuU lectureship 
on poetry was founded, in 1891, at the Johns 
Hopkins University, the author of these two 
volumes was the inevitable choice for the inaug- 
ural series of discourses, and Mr. Stedman, 
putting aside all other work, shut himself up 
for months in the library of The Players, and 
prepared his last great work of critical apprecia- 
tion, the work which was afterwards published 
as " The Nature and Elements of Poetry." 
These three books made clear his title as the 
foremost of our critics. Lowell alone might 
have been held a possible competitor for that 
distinction, but Lowell, with all his brilliancy 
and wit and fine feeling, was lacking in the 
comprehensive view and the philosophical grasp 
that characterize Stedman's critical writing. It 
is not too much to say that the three volumes 
now in question constitute America's most solid 
and lasting contribution to the literature of 
criticism. 

As a poet, of course, Mr. Stedman was but one 
among many of high rank ; we may not even 
call him primus inter pares ; but the fact that 
his place is a little below that of three or four 
writers of the New England group shoidd not 
lessen the warmth of our tribute of gratitude for 
the precious gift of his song. In the days of 
our war-agony he voiced the national feeling in 
unforgettable strains, and for a full generation 
afterward continued to produce work which was 
always worthy and often memorable for beauty 
and artistic distinction. His lyrical faculty was 
remarkable, he had the trick of effective bal- 
ladry, and he was almost unsurpassed as a 
writer of occasional and coromemorative verse. 
His long poems — " Alice of Monmouth " and 
" The I Blameless Prince" — did not become 
widely popular, but they are still well deserving 
of attention and respect. His reputation also 
suffered in some degree from the fact that a 
number of poets from ten to thirty years his 
senior were already firmly fixed in the national 
affection, and our public did not keenly feel the 
need of more. 

Mr. Stedman's personality was so engaging, 
and was the outward expression of a character 
of such fineness of fibre, that he bound men to 
himself by ties of more than common affection. 
His charm, his sincerity, and his generous sym- 
pathies made themselves felt by young and old 
alike, radiating upon all who came within the 
reach of their influence. Whether as the cen- 
tral figure of a great public gathering, or as one 
of a group in some club corner, or as the com- 



panion with whom a single intimate held high 
converse concerning the things of the mind, he 
always entered genially into the spirit of the 
situation, and the occasional touch of sharpness 
in his manner which gave salt to the discourse 
was merely the index of an intelligence so alert, 
so quick in its response to stimidus, that it was 
impatient of all the transparent devices whereby 
men of slower wit played for time to collect 
their thoughts. To use a physical metaphor, 
his own electric potential was so high that he 
induced currents of unwonted intensity in the 
minds that came within the reach of his own. 
And this keen eager interest in all that pei*- 
tained to art and letters and life was unimpaired 
by the shocks of fate — more severe in his case 
than most men have to bear — and remained as 
characteristic of his broken closing years as it 
had been of his prime. The last thing that could 
have been said of him was that he lagged super- 
fluous on the stage, or that he had outlived his 
day. 

Fifteen years ago, Mr. Stedman wrote a 
sonnet with these opening lines : 

" Give me to die unwitting of the day, 

And stricken in Life's brave heat, with senses clear: 
Not swathed and couched until the lines appear 
Of Death's wan mask upon this withering clay." 

The " Mors Benefica " for whose touch he thus 
prayed came to him the other day, and his wish 
was fulfilled. A sudden failure of the heart, 
and all was over. 

" Dead he lay among his books," 
and the word went forth that our foremost man 
of letters, the last of our earlier poets, was no 
more. Some hint of what that message meant 
was to be seen in the distinguished company that 
gathered in the Church of the Messiah three 
days later, to share in the impressive services 
which paid the last of earthly honors to the 
beloved dead. 



HOLGEB DBA CHMANN, 

For the past score of years, the two greatest 
men of letters in Denmark have been the critic 
Dr. Brandes, and the poet and novelist Holger 
Drachmann. Now Drachmann is dead, in his sixty- 
second year, and the event means almost as much 
for Danish letters as the death of Ibsen did for 
Norwegian letters year before last. His powerful 
individuality expressed itself in great numbers of 
lyrics and ballads, in plays, in formal works of 
fiction, and in a sort of rhapsodical prose not easily 
classifiable. To describe him as a blend of Byron 
with Walt Whitman would not be far from the truth. 
He had Byron's restive nature, his passion for the 



64

sea, and his tendency to regard all conventional 
morality as hypocrisy and to revolt against it. On 
the other hand, he had much of Whitman's radi- 
calism and democracy, and of his disregard for lit- 
erary form. 

Drachmann began life as a painter, and the sea 
was the favorite subject of his brush as afterwards 
of his pen. In 1870 he settled in London for a 
time, painting and writing, lived with workingmen 
and nursed his scorn of priests and aristocrats and 
the middle-class view of life. His delight in this 
period was to 6pater le bourgeois, and respectable 
Denmark looked askance at his writings. His first 
book of poems appeared in 1872, and marked the 
formal entrance into literature of one of the most 
prolific of modern Danish authors. In middle life 
he made terms (of a sort) with society, and accepted 
honors (which he still half -despised) from the 
classes whose sentiments he had outraged. But he 
covild not remain long in the harness, and his later 
years found him again a wanderer in many lands, 
his sympathies always with the humble and the 
downtrodden, although he did not wholly forego 
his friendly relations with the mighty. In the late 
nineties he spent two years or more in the United 
States ; and it was in an evening of the spring of 
1900, when he was dining In Chicago with the writer 
of these lines, that he received the message from 
King Oscar asking him to come at once to Stock- 
holm, that ended his American sojourn. Among his 
works we may mention, besides the many collections 
of verse, his translation of Byron's " Don Juan " 
into Danish, his "Beyond the Border," his highly 
successful play "Once upon a Time," his "Pledged," 
a long and serious work of fiction, and his " Sacred 
Fire," a book belonging to no particular class, 
written during his stay in this country. The only 
one of his books that has, to our knowledge, been 
translated into English is the idyllic tale called 
" Paul and Virginia of a Northern Zone," a slight 
but exquisite performance. In one of his most suc- 
cessful lyrics this outcry occurs : 

" Oh! had I command of a viking ship, 
With a hundred fighters on board! " 

It is a typical expression of his masterful personality, 
and those who knew by sight that giant frame sur- 
mounted by that magnificent head needed no more 
to imagine his wish fulfilled, and to picture him as 
the hero of some successful raid upon the coast of 
Normandy, or the Piraeus, or the stronghold of 
Micklegarth itself. 



Two important publications of the Hakluyt Society 
are at hand. One of them contains translations, by Sir 
Clements Markham, of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa's 
" History of the Incas " and Baltasar de Ocampo's "The 
Execution of the luca Tupac Amaru." The other, from 
the same translator, includes two nai-ratives of the Friar 
Alonso de Espiuosa: " The Guanches of Teuerife " and 
" The Holy Image of Our Lady of Candelaria." Mr. 
Bernard Quaritch, London, is the agent for the publica- 
tions of the Society. 



PATRIOTISM AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. 



The late King Oscar of Sweden gave his sanction 
and support to the establishment of Swedish circulat- 
ing libraries in those parts of the United States most 
largely settled by emigrants from his own kingdom. 
This was done in the hope of keeping warm in the 
exile's heart the love of the mother country, her 
language and literature, and of thus inducing him 
to return some day to the land of his birth. These 
Swedish libraries are said to have been in successful 
operation in the middle West for a year past ; and 
lately a consignment of books has been received at 
Worcester, Mass., the Swedish centre of New En- 
gland. Each Swedish church there is to have its 
share of these books, which will be replaced by fresh 
sendings from Sweden as often as desired. 

This plan, excellent from a Scandinavian point of 
view, may at first strike one as of doubtful merit 
when looked at from this side of the Atlantic. That 
the alien colonist of cultiu"e and means, and possessed 
of the valuable assets of character and success which 
these intellectual and material acquisitions stand for, 
should be encouraged to withdraw his abilities and 
his resources from the scene where they have been 
chiefly developed or acquired, seems a little unfair. 
Having once renounced his allegiance to a land 
imable to satisfy his growing ambitions and desires, 
should he not remain true to the adoptive mother 
whose bounty he has been so willing to enjoy? 
Undoubtedly the spectacle of a returning emigrant, 
his pockets filled with American gold, hastening back 
to the old country to enjoy his wealth amid the scenes 
of his youth, is to us not the most pleasing that could 
be imagined. The throwing away of a sucked orange 
is never a graceful gesture ; and no country enjoys 
bemg treated like a sucked orange. 

But it is a question whether the effect desired by 
King Oscar will follow as a result of his generous 
act. At any rate, it will be interesting to note, if 
possible, whether these Swedish libraries really do 
promote a return of literature-loving Swedish settlers 
to the native land. Hitherto it has been the re- 
patriation of the less cultured and less desirable 
foreigners that has attracted attention. The Chinese 
laundryman's eagerness to get back to his feUow- 
celestials with a few hundred dollars earned in the 
sweat of his brow over the hot flatiron, is notorious. 
The Italian ditch-digger's or organ-grinder's dream 
of ending his days in the sunny land of abundant 
macaroni and cheap sour wine — a dream, too, that 
is not seldom realized — is equally well known. That 
the impulse to re-knit the severed home ties increases 
in strength with the intelligence and culture of the 
emigrant, has yet to be proved. More likely is it 
that superior mental endowments and acquirements, 
such as are not uncommonly indicated by the reading 
habit, beget increased appreciation of the larger 
opportunity and the greater freedom of American 
life, and a disinclination to resume the narrower 
existence that has been left behind.

Whatever the truth of the matter, it would be 
interesting to have the opinion of public library 
officers in our cosmopolitan or foreign-settled cities 
and villages as to whether the providing of foreign 
literature for the aliens in our midst tends to make 
them good and contented citizens of their adoptive 
country, or the reverse. One likes to believe that 
a broad and generous policy in this regard will 
prove the wisest for all concerned. " Give to the 
world the best you have, and the best will come 
back to you," is a noble sentiment, and we should 
be sorry to see it prove false in our treatment of the 
homesick foreigner visiting our public libraries in 
quest of a book endeared by early associations. As 
a matter of fact, what could more greatly aid in 
tiding the unhappy alien over his period of acute 
nostalgia than a readily-accessible bookcase of his 
favorite authors, supposing him of sufficient intelli- 
gence to have such favorites ? Boston, a city of 
very mixed population, provides for its public-library 
users a generous assortment of books in many for- 
eign languages, and separate catalogues of these 
collections are printed and all but gratuitously dis- 
tributed. The list of Russian books, for example, 
is a pamphlet containing about six hundred titles ; 
and the accessions since it was printed, twelve 
years ago, would swell the number considerably. 
Russian literature, too, is in far less demand than 
the literatures of several other foreign countries, 
which are more abundantly represented. Yet 
with aU this kindly consideration for the reading 
wants of her immigrant population, Boston is not 
heard to complain of an exodus of her more de- 
sirable foreign-born citizens ; and her experience is 
probably that of many other large cities similarly 
situated. 

The relation of race and language to international 
sympathies and antipathies is of course too vast and 
too difficult a subject for treatment here. Historical 
inquiry and philological research have played their 
part in producing effects not merely scientific and 
literary, but political and practical. As Freeman 
once observed, " the world is not the same world as 
when men had not dreamed of the kindred between 
Sanscrit, Greek, and English, when it was looked 
on as something of a paradox to hint that there was 
a distinction between Celtic and Teutonic tongues 
and nations." The change that, by various agencies, 
has been wrought in a comparatively short time, is 
again noted by the same historian when he says that 
" a hundred years ago a man's political likes and 
dislikes seldom went beyond the range which was 
suggested by the place of his bu-th or immediate 
descent. Such birth or descent made him a mem- 
ber of this or that political community, a subject of 
this or that prince, a citizen — perhaps a subject — 
of this or that commonwealth. The political com- 
munity of which he was a member had its tradi- 
tional alliances and traditional enmities, and by those 
alliances and enmities the likes and dislikes of the 
members of that community were guided. But those 
traditional alliances and enmities were seldom 



determined by theories about language or race." 
And he goes on with further interesting but for us 
not exactly pertinent reflections. 

In the mere matter of language-growth and of rich- 
ness of vocabulary, the presence among us of many 
tliat speak other tongues than ours is of advantage to 
our own. The unwisdom of legislation designed to 
discourage the use of a foreign idiom is too obvious 
to need enlarging upon, its futility too abundantly 
proved in the past to remain longer in doubt. The 
Polish language and literature still flourish despite 
the efforts of three great powers to suppress them. 
The Norman conquerors' helpless surrender to a 
despised tongue is a matter of familiar history. 
Throughout our great English-speaking country are 
scattered families and communities that cling for a 
while to the mother tongue they have brought with 
them from over-seas, but the assimilation by us of 
these alien elements is only a question of time. 
Attempts to discourage or to prevent the teaching 
of this or that foreign language in this or that public 
school, or to keep out of the public libraries books 
dear to the hearts of those who as yet know no 
English — even where such attempts seek to justify 
themselves under the name of patriotism — are ill- 
advised. Too much that styles itself patriotism is 
nothing but magnified selfishness. Exclusion laws 
and tariff walls, whatever their necessity or merits, 
represent, in the large, a greedy boy's determination 
to eat his big apple undiminished by a single bite. 
As the greater includes the less, so the love of man- 
kind includes the love of country ; and more and 
more, as the world emerges from its dark age of 
illiteracy, is it coming to be recognized that all 
nations are members one of another, and whether 
one member suffer, all the members suffer with it ; 
or one member be honored, all the members re- 
joice with it. With this principle in mind, even 
if held as a theory of doubtful application in all 
cases, most persons will commend King Oscar's 
establishment of Swedish circulating libraries for 
Swedish Americans. The English-speaking children 
and grandchildren of these settlers will be all the 
heartier supporters of our own public-library system 
for the consideration thus shown to their elders. In 
dealing with the adult immigrant of alien speech, 
an impatient person is prone to forget, what Bacon 
has so well expressed, that " in languages the tongue 
is more pliant to all expressions and sounds, the 
joints are more supple to all feats of activity and 
motions in youth, than afterwards ; for it is true that 
late learners cannot so well take the ply, except it 
be in some minds that have not suffered themselves 
to fix, but have kept themselves open and prepared 
to receive continual amendment, which is exceeding 
rare." Finally, may it not be that many a foreign- 
born citizen loves his adoptive country so much only 
because he is permitted to love his native land still 
more — because he lives in a town or village or large 
city that helps to keep alive this love of the mother 
country by generously providing books to read in the 
mother tongue ?

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Thk death of Louise de la Ramee, far better 
known as " Ouida," brings to its close a career as im- 
possibly romantic and extravagant as that of one of her 
typical heroines. Having published her first novel in 
1863 and reached the height of her popularity in the 
late seventies, " Ouida " lived to see the passing of the 
age of sentimentality and the rise of a new school of 
novel-writing that should conform to the more exact- 
ing standards of an increasingly sophisticated public. 
Nevertheless, she continued to stem the tide with a 
book or so a year, publishing her " Critical Studies " 
and "The Waters of Edera" in 1900, and "Street 
Dust " in 1901. But while her novels have passed into 
obscurity and are spoken of nowadays chiefly to be held 
up to ridicule, her stories for children — "A Dog of 
Flanders," « Bimbi," and « Two Little Wooden Shoes " 
— are, oddly enough, almost classic. Herself a primi- 
tive nature, she was naturally at her best in writing of 
peasants and children — simple, single-hearted, pas- 
sionate creatures like herself, who live in a world where 
fact and fancy mingle and the boundaries between real 
and ideal are often lost sight of. That was the only 
world "Ouida" knew. Equally impractical in managing 
her personal afPairs and the plots of her novels, she is 
said to have died in abject poverty, the fortune that her 
books had earned for her gone, and only a tiny pension 
that the English government had provided between her 
and starvation. And most of that, with cliaracteristic 
improvidence, she spent on her pet dogs. Undoubtedly 
the explanation of her once tremendous vogue lies in 
the fa«t that her work was always sincere. She wrote, 
at her best and at her worst, to please herself, and there- 
fore she often pleased other people. 

Library progress in Maryland is slow — slower 
than one would exjject it to be in a State having such 
ready communication, through its sea-ports, its great 
rivers and bays, and its many railways, with the outside 
world ; holding almost in its embrace the capital of the 
country; and counting among its educational institutions 
the Johns Hopkins University and the United States 
Naval Academy. The fifth annual report of the Mary- 
land State Library Commission, just issued, depicts a 
dearth of public libi-aries, and a lack of popular interest 
in libraries and literature that might far more naturally 
characterize a newer and less favorably situated State. 
Mr. Ross M. Diggs, field secretary of the commission, 
says in part: " I find that many large towns are without 
any library facilities at all, and such is the condition of 
most of the small towns and villages, with a few striking 
exceptions. The mass of the people in our State are 
not a reading people, and consequently there is little 
demand among them for books. What books are read 
consist mainly of the most recent light literature. . . . 
It is a difficult problem to get a non-reading public to 
build and maintain libraries ; but it is possible to convert 
them gradually into a reading public which will demand 
books and, therefore, build libraries. It is the aim of 
the Commission first to stimulate a demand for books, 
and next to help and guide the people to the attauiment 
of the means for meeting their wants." The starting of 
a small collection of books by the villagers themselves 
is regarded as the first and the important step; after 
that, state aid and local support by taxation will be more 
successfully solicited. Here is a field for missionary 
labor on the part of library workers. It is encour- 



aging to read that eighty-one travelling hbraries have 
circulated in nineteen of the twenty-three counties. 
Washington County is omitted from this list; but the 
good work done by the library-wagon sent out by the 
Hagerstown Free Library, as noted nearly a year ago 
in these columns, should not be overlooked. 

The mission of the newspaper is the subject of a 
recent newspaper article from the pen of a Baltimore 
doctor of divinity. The daily paper, even the sensa- 
tional Simday paper, is praised in terms that glow to 
the point of incandescence. A curious argument in 
favor of the Simday journal is that its reading supplies 
Qccupation for the thousands who, in every large city, 
could not possibly find even standing-room in the 
churches. To this an opponent might urge that if there 
were fewer Sunday papers there would perhaps be more 
churches. The endless debate this might lead to is not 
in place here. Let us instead quote a few of the rev- 
erend doctor's rhapsodical Sentences in praise of news- 
papers in general. " There is no literature for the 
common people," he declares, "like that of the news- 
paper. It is the daily companion alike of the prince 
and the peasant, the man who inherits and the man who 
earns, of the millionaire in his mansion and the laborer 
in his cot. It comes as regularly as the glow of the 
lamplight, and finds a welcome at every fireside. If the 
night be fair, if the winter's storm beats madly at the 
window pane, it does not matter — this messenger is 
present to entertain and instruct, to tell to willing ears 
in that little circle what is going on in the great bustling 
world without. A good paper, secular or religious, 
is a blessing in the home. . . Oh, for the day when 
these white-winged can-ier doves shall be all and more 
than our highest and best ideal ! " All this, and more, 
appearing in a Baltimore paper at the same time with 
the publication of the State Library Commission's report 
of Maryland's sad lack of interest in books and public 
collections of books, as set forth in the precedmg para- 
graph, might suggest some curious comment, from 
which, however, we refrain. It is at least gratifying to 
note that the newspaper whose Sunday issue prints the 
clergyman's interesting contribution is one of the best 
in the city — and, in fact, in the country.

Public library organization unassisted by 
legislation has now been entered upon by Kansas ; so 
that, whatever may still be the matter with that State, 
she is no longer to be reproached with inactivity in the 
matter of public libraries. Mr. A. D. Dickinson, public 
librarian at Leavenworth, has been appointed temporary 
organizer for the State by the Kansas Library Associa- 
tion. The following is from an explanatory statement 
issued by him to libraries and citizens of Kansas: " Many 
libraries are being established in this State to-daj. The 
library interests of Kansas require the immediate ser- 
vices of an organizer. Convinced of this, and havmg 
thus far been unable to secure the necessary legislation, 
the Kansas Library Association at its annual meeting in 
October appointed one of its members to act temporarily 
in that capacity, in order to demonstrate practically the 
usefulness of such an officer. In performance of his 
duties the organizer will considt with towns plaiming 
the organization or reorganization of public libraries on 
all matters pertaining to the architecture, the adminis- 
tration, and the technical work of libraries; he will 
assist in framing city ordinances for the maintenance 
of libraries; and he will spare no effort which will help

to build up a public library system eommeusurate with 
the needs of the State. Funds to pay the immediate 
office expenses of the organizer are being contributed 
through the association by individuals, women's clubs, 
and libraries." Therefore the organizer's services are 
rendered gratis, except for travelling and hotel ex- 
penses. Another illustration, this, of generous effort 
for the public gootl, put forth without hope of material 
reward, by those engaged in library work.

The book record of 1907 in England shows that 
year to have been a pi-osperous or at least a busy one 
with English publishers. They issued nearly ten thous- 
and books — or, more exactly, 9914, of which 7701 
were new, the remainder being new editions. In 1906 
the corresponding figures were 8603 and 6985, showing 
gains of 1311 and 716, respectively. Thus it appears 
that the manufacture of books increased 15 per cent. 
The increase in readers — that is, in population — could 
not have been nearly so great; hence it must have been 
a year of activity for readei-s as well as publishers, 
unless an unusual proportion of books went misold and 
unread, which does not appear to have been the case. 
An encouraging sign in some respects is the falling off 
in the publication of fiction, from 2108 to 1862, and 
the considerable increase in theology (who would have 
thought it?), history, and biography. It may be that 
novel-readers turned in greater numbers than usual from 
pure fiction to its next of kin, gossipy biogi-aphy and 
reminiscences. But the serious bent indicated by the 
unusual demand for (or supply of) works on religion is 
difficult to account for in this openuig twentieth century. 
Is it possible that the Christian world is already begin- 
ning to get itself into a fit frame of mind fot' the second 
millennium, ninety-two years hence ?

The needs of the children as library-users are 
in some quarters receiving what a childless adult might 
think to be undue attention. Whether the English 
authority on library administration, Mr. James Duff 
Brown, is unblessed with offspring, or has a quiverful, 
we do not know ; but in the revised edition of his 
" Manual of Library Economy " he takes occasion to 
say : " When a public libraiy has provided an adequate 
children's room, and reduced its age limit to a reason- 
able and liberal degree, it has done all that is necessary 
or desirable without trenching upon the work of the 
public schools or fostering this particular class of 
youthful citizen at the expense of liis seniors who have 
to find the money. With all respect for the admirable 
work in connection with children's libraries and the 
cultivation of intimate relationship with the public 
schools, both in the United States and in Britain, there 
is a very grave danger of this particular outlet for lib- 
rary enthusiasm becoming a damaging influence on the 
interests of the general work of public Ubraries. Already 
there are libraries in the United States and iii England 
where everything is subordinated to the special cult of 
the child, and where the claims of adult readers are 
being brushed aside in the pursuit of what is largely, in 
many cases, a sentimental fantasy." At the same tune 
with this protest there comes from the Examining 
Conmiittee of the Boston Public Library a complaint 
that " too much is done for the child, not enough for the 
adult," with interesting particulars. There is little 
doubt that sometimes libraries of enterprise and ambi- 
tion engage in work that might better be left to the 
schools. 



The circulation of serious books is encouraged 
by all wise librarians, and a plan has been proposed in 
London for increasing this circulation. Those who read 
nothing but fiction, which in most cases means the worst 
fiction, are to be required (if the plan is ever carried 
out) to draw with every novel a work of soberer cast, 
chosen either by themselves or by the attendant. The 
absurdity of it all is not entirely ignored by the author 
of the plan; but he argues that, although no one can com- 
pel the reading of the serious book, it may be taken up 
by some member of the family and at least dipped into. 
Its presence on the sitting-room table is more conducive 
to this than is its undisturbed repose on the library shelf. 
Although such an exercise of paternalism on the part of 
the library authorities would be of questionable wisdom, 
an intelligent and observant desk-attendant can always 
accomplish something (if not overburdened with work) 
by gently and unobtiiisively directing attention to the 
choice flowers of literature (not fiction) wasting their 
sweetness on the musty air of the stock-room. A desk- 
attendant of oiu- acquaintance — one of the imintelligent, 
unobservant sort — once showed great perplexity and 
even consternation on being asked to recommend some 
good book to an applicant whose literary yearnings were 
of the vaguest. Such a request evidently struck this 
slave of routine and red tape as most irregular and be- 
wildering. ... 

A growing interest in library news appears 
from the increasing frequency with which such news is 
printed in our daily and weekly papers. The Boston 
" Transcript " — one of the few journals that as yet 
maintain a regular library department, and one of the 
best in this respect — takes occasion to commend The 
Dial for publishing library notes. " The Dial," it 
says, " nearly always contains interesting library news, 
preferring, as a rule, the human and generally interest- 
ing side of library work to its statistical features." The 
same writer kmdly corrects a false impression conveyed 
by a recent paragraph m these columns. The paragraph 
contained a reference to the "Letters of a Chinese 
Official," and, says our courteous critic, " gave the im- 
pression that the reply to the book by Mr. William J. 
Bryan was suppressed before publication. If The 
Dial cares to look at the book in the Chicago Public 
Library, it can find that Mr. Bryan says, in a pref atorj- 
note, that he wrote his reply believing the ' Letters ' to 
be the work of a genuine Chinaman. Before publica- 
tion he learned that an Englishman was the real author, 
but he decided to publish his work without alteration."

Magazine madness has never been more amusingly 
displayed than in the current announcement of a new 
sensational periodical. In its illustrations the new pub- 
lication seems bent on rivalling the rainbow in poly- 
chromatic brilhance: it is, in fact, advertised as "the 
hottest pictorial proposition that ever hit a news-stand." 
And further, "if this brand-new idea in magazine mak- 
ing does not wake you up you are hopelessly asleep." 
Therefore " get a copy next issue, and wake up ! Its 
pages teem with smashing good fiction, irresistible humor, 
serials that grip the human heart, things that appeal to 
the finer sensibilities, and special articles that will keep 
you entranced, enthralled, and make you watch anxiously 
for the next issue — which will be better still." If the 
first number is to send the reader into such a delirium 
of rapture, it is to be feared that the next, " which will 
be better still," will fairly paralyze him — will produce 
an effect so stunning as to be fatal. The very name of

Accessions to the National Library in the past 
year swell its total volume of books and pamphlets to 
near a million and a half — or 1,433,848, to be more 
exact — its pieces of music to 464,618, its prints to 
253,822, and its maps and chai'ts to 98,483. In addi- 
tion to books reaching it through the regular channels, 
the library acquired, at so small a cost as almost to make 
the acquisition a gift, the Yudin Library (mainly in 
Russian) of more than 80,000 volumes on Russia and 
Siberia. The moving of this large collection from 
Ki-asnoiarsk in Siberia to Washington took about three 
months' time. Some nine thousand works on Japan 
were also secured for the library by Dr. Asakawa of 
Yale. Another evidence of the rapid growth of this 
vast collection of books is furnished by the superinten- 
dent's call for more shelving. He advises the roofing 
over of the southeast courtyard and its conversion into 
a bookstack, nine tiers high. 

The year's events in the library world, as 
noted by " Public Libraries " in reviewing the most 
important happenings of 1907 in our library activity, 
were the discussion of the subject of permanent head- 
quarters for the American Library Association; the 
discontinuance of official relations between this associa- 
tion and " The Library Journal " ; the Copyright 
League's opposition, apparently successful, to the 
restriction of free importation of books for public libra- 
ries; the begimiing of state commission work for 
libraries in Missouri and North Dakota, with somewhat 
similar activity in Kansas and Illinois; and the signal 
growth and development of the Library of Congress. 
Our national library, we are told, has now " advanced 
to third place among the great libraries of the world in 
size, while in the variety and extent of its activities it 
probably ranks first." 



COMMUNICA TION. 



PROBLEMS OF THE SMALLER LIBRARIES. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

As trustee of a village library, I was interested in a 
note in a recent number of your journal, concerning 
the professional status and pay of librarians. Were it 
not for the occasional library notes in the pages of The 
Dial, I should begin to think that the old ideal of hav- 
ing in the library a man or a woman who loves books 
(and their contents) had passed away, — this type which, 
professional or not, has been sought so eagerly by library 
boards among the graduates of library schools and else- 
where. 

There is a pretty widespread feeling, I find, that 
library schools do not inculcate this kind of profession- 
alism, but, rather, a spirit which is radically different. 
Certain it is that, whatever the aim of the schools, some 
trustees who have had experience with graduates of 
extended library courses have found them willing — 
shall I say eager? — to forget much of the instruction 
that had been given them, or else so tired of the backs 
of books that they could not care for their contents. 
This is hardly a professional spirit. In the smaller libra- 



ries the librarians spend perforce the largest part of 
their time in such-work as cutting leaves, stamping books 
and magazines, placing papers on the racks and books 
on the shelves, charging and receiving books at the desk, 
writing catalogue cards, and doing simple bookkeeping. 
And this is hardly professional work. I have read 
of librarians who in addition to these duties, and some 
others that might be called professional, lured children 
to the library building and then to good reading by 
beautiful stories, or enticed adult appetites jaded by bad 
fiction to try some more substantial food, aud by their 
personal activities invigorated the intellectual life of the 
entire community. But the small urban library, which 
perhaps most needs such personalities, almost never can 
find them, even among those who are " professionally " 
trained. 

The problem that confronts a multitude of small 
libraries with mcomes from $1000 to $3500 is to save 
enough money, after the running expenses are paid, to 
buy books. And it has seemed to more than one board 
of trustees that it was not justified in paying the salai-y, 
small though it is, of a graduate of a librarj' school 
for such service as is rendered. Many of these boards, 
having the best interest of the library sincerely at heart, 
do not believe that the position of librarian should be 
filled by someone whose only qualification is that she has 
failed at teaching school or that she needs the financial 
help. That is not the alternative. There are in many 
commimities men and women who, after short training, 
or by the exercise of common sense and by private 
study, can perform all the mechanical work of the 
library, and get other results fairly satisfactory to 
the community, even to those who are discriminating. 
Although untrained in the schools, they after a while 
learn the use of the few reference books that the small 
library afPords ; and if they are lovers of learning and 
of letters, they are of genuine help to the book com- 
mittee in the selection of new books. 

There remains the "classification according to Dewey." 
This is not the time to voice a complaint, which is as 
widespread among book-lovers as are books, against the 
" system "; it is now so generally used that we probably 
must accept it. But when trained librarians classify 
Trilby under French fiction, N. P. Willis imder British 
poets, widely separate two books by the same author on 
the same subject, and are unable to agree on other 
classifications even after knowing what the books con- 
tain, — to illustrate briefly from personal observation, — 
it is no longer any wonder that the untrained make errors. 

So my practical suggestion is this : If some library 
school, some board, or, preferably, the Library of Con- 
gress, would furnish upon application at a moderate 
price the correct classification of books according to the 
Dewey Decimal System, to which most libraries here- 
abouts are committed, small libraries could then secure 
service adequate to their needs and at the same time 
save enough money to buy some books wth which to 
justify their existence. Even an entei'prising book- 
supply house might satisfy this demand and incidentally 
enlarge its business. Of course the American Library 
Association Catalogue and Monthly Book List do this in 
a partial way, and some of these classification numbers 
are copied on the Library of Congress cards; but so far 
as I have been able to learn from professional librarians, 
there is no source from which one may secure the cor- 
rect classification of all books that a library may care 
to buy. Thomas H. Briggs.

An Irish Poet's Literary Friendships.* 

Clearness, simplicity, and a modest charm 
of their own are found in the poems, now ap- 
parently little read, of William Allingham of 
Ballyshannon — for there he was born, in 1824, 
and there he spent much of his early life, 
cultivating his muse and sitting at the receipt 
of customs. His custom-house activities, much 
earlier entered upon and longer continued than 
Hawthorne's, were not entirely suspended until 
1870, when he settled in London and assumed 
the sub-editorship, under Fronde, of " Fraser's 
Magazine." Meantime he had shifted from 
place to place, at one short period relinquishing 
his government position and trying a London 
literary life (which he speedily abandoned be- 
cause he would be no publisher's hack), and at 
all times writing, and occasionally publishing, 
verses that enjoyed a more or less pronounced 
success in the world of letters. In spite of 
his ambitious narrative poem in heroic metre, 
" Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland," which he put 
forth in his prime and regarded as his most import- 
ant work, we think of him as an English rather 
than an Irish poet, and take far more pleasure in 
his short and simple " Day and Night Songs " 
than in that rather formidable social document 
which exhibits the fortunes of his Hibernian hero. 

In ''William Allingham: a Diary" is pre- 
sented a fairly complete account, in a necessarily 
disjointed style, of the poet's life. The first 
thirty-three pages of the book are written out in 
autobiographic form, and bring AUingham's life 
down to his twenty-third year. At this point 
in the text the purpose of leaving behind him 
a full and formal autobiography seems to have 
been abandoned by the poet, and the rest of the 
book, which extends to four hundred ample pages, 
is made up of extracts from a very full but hastily 
written diary, with occasional passages of connect- 
ing narrative from Mrs. AUingham's pen, where 
the regular entries are for any cause intermitted. 

AUingham's intimacy with Rossetti was 
brought to notice by the appearance in " The 
Atlantic Monthly," twelve years ago, of the pre- 
Raphaelite's letters (considered the best he ever 
wrote) to the Irish-bom poet. And this was 
by no means the only literary friendship that 
Allingham formed in London : his diary shows 
him to have been a welcome guest at the homes 
of nearly all the writing folk of his time. Leigh

Hunt was apparently the first celebrity to " take 
up" the young poet, but intimate relations were 
soon knit with Burne-Jones, Browning, Rossetti, 
Tennyson, Carlyle, and many others. So con- 
stant a visitor was he to the house in CReyne 
Row that Carlyle's niece once told her uncle, 
" People say Mr. Allingham is to be your 
Boswell"; to which the answer was, " Well, let 
him try it. He 's very accurate." 

Taken from school at fourteen to go into a 
bank at Ballyshannon, whence he soon entered 
the customs service, Allinghatn was forced to 
educate himself in all branches higher than the 
rudiments of learning ; and it speaks well for 
his industry and his good natural parts that he 
was able to stand on a footing of equality with 
contemporary English men of letters. A diary 
extract, written m 1847, gives some interesting- 
glimpses of Leigh Hunt as young Allingham 
saw him when he first visited him in London. 

" Sunday Evening, June 27. — 32 Edwardes Square, 
and And Leigh Hunt at last. I was shown into the study 
and had some minutes to look roimd at the Book-cases, 
Busts, old framed engravings, and to glance at some of 
the books on the table, diligently marked and noted in 
the well-known neatest of hand-writings. Outside the 
window climbed a hop on its trellis. The door opened 
and in came the Genius Loci, a tallish yomig old man, 
in dark dressing-gown and mde turned-down shirt- 
collar, his copious iron-gray hair falling almost to his 
shoulders. The friendly brown eyes, simple yet fine- 
toned voice, easy hand-pressure, gave me greeting as to 
one already well-known to him. Our talk fell first on 
reason and instinct; he maintained (for argument's sake, 
I thought) that beasts maybe equal or superior to men. 
He has a light earnestness of manner, and toleration for 
almost every possible different point of view from his 
own. Of freewill he said, ' I would much rather be 
without it. I should like to feel myself taken care of 
in the arms of beneficent power. . . . Browning — lives 
at Peckham, because no one else does ! a born poet, but 
loves contradictions. Shakespeare and Milton write 
plainly, the Sun and Moon write plainly, and why can't 
Browning ? ' I suggested he was the Tiu-ner of poetry, 
to which Leigh Hunt replied, ' Now, you 've said it ! He 's 
a pleasant fellow, has few readers, and will be glad to 
find yon admire him.' (!!) 'I shall now be able to see 
my friends oftener, and will take an opportunity of ask- 
ing Dickens, Carlyle, and Browning to meet you.' 
(Gracious Powers!!!) ' I would do so for few.' " 

The following, dated Oct. 4, 1863, shows 
Tennyson in an unfamiliar (and involuntary) 
attitude ; it also contains one out of many illus- 
trations of AUingham's quickness of wit. 

" T. takes me upstairs to his * den ' on the top-story, 
and liigher, up a ladder, to the leads. He often comes 
up here a-night to look at the heavens. One night he 
was watching shooting-stars and tumbled through the 
hatchway, falling on the floor below, a height of at least 
ten feet I should say. The ladder probably broke his 
fall and he was not hurt. I quoted ' A certain star shot 
madly from his sphere.' "

[Feb. 1, 



A still further excerpt, referring to an earlier 
visit at the Tennyson home, is worth giving for its 
introduction of Edward FitzGerald as raconteur. 
The story he tells is found somewhere in his letters, 
but may be not too stale for reproduction here. 

" Returning to the drawing-room I found Mrs. 
Tennyson — sweet, pale, and kind; Mr. Fi>ederick 
Tennyson the eldest of the brothers, and Mr. Edward 
FitzGerald (Omar Khayyam). . . . Mr. FitzGerald 
(' Fitz '), an old and intimate friend, told droll stories 
with a quaint gravity, much amusing Mrs. Tennyson in 
particular. One was about old Miss Edgeworth, whom 
he knew, and her turban. She used to take it off for 
coolness and resume it when visitors were announced. 
One day by some mischance a strange gentleman came 
into the room and found her writing with her almost 
bald pate plainly visible. Miss E. started up with the 
greatest agility, seized her turban which lay close by, and 
darted through an opposite door, whence she quickly 
reappeared with the decoration upon her head, but 
unluckily turned wrong side foremost." 

Carlyle figures frequently in the diary, and 
many of his sayings are quoted — all character- 
istic, but not often of any great moment. The 
following remarks are as quotable as any. 

" C. spoke of Sydney Smith, to whom he was able to 
give no praise at all. ' Tlie nature of true Wit is very 
much misunderstood. Sydney said nothing worth re- 
membering. He said " it took a surgical operation to 
get a joke into a Scotchman's head "; the thing is, that 
what Sydney presented was not a joke worth admitting 
into any one's head, and the Scotchman refused to have 
anything to do with it. The Scotch are a people with 
a large appreciation of fim very generally among them. 
... I remember seeing Sydney Smith setting himself 
to make a company laugh, and I left him there at it, 
reflecting what a wretched ambition it was in any 
man.' . . . He spoke of a debate long ago at the London 
Library about the appointment of a Librarian. C. was 
for one man, Gladstone for a certain Italian. C. said: 
' I discovered then that Gladstone had the art of speak- 
ing. He and I were like Valentine and Orson. I laid 
about with a rough club, he got up in shining armour 
and drew his sword. But all in vain, too ; by no sleight 
of fence could he carry his point.' " 

AHingham died on the 18th November, 1889. 
Shortly before he drew his last breath he said, 
" I am seeing things that you know nothing of." 
By his express wish, his body was cremated, 
no funeral service being held, and only a few 
relatives and friends being present at the crema- 
tion. Mr. F. G. Stephens, the oldest of the 
assembled friends, read aloud Allingham's own 
" Poet's Epitaph," — 

" Body to purifying flame. 
Soul to the Great Deep whence it came. 
Leaving a song on earth below. 
An urn of ashes white as snow." 

In literary charm the book suffers from being 
so largely a rudis indigestaqve moles — for 
which, however, no one is to blame, unless we 
choose to quarrel with the dead poet for drop- 



ping so soon the autobiography that he had begun 
to frame out of his diary material. This too- 
short portion, indeed, does possess a very read- 
able quality. Mrs. Allingham and Mrs. Radford 
have done good editorial work ; and the four 
portraits reproduced from Mrs. Allingham's own 
water-color drawings — two of her husband and 
one each of Tennyson and Carlyle — are inter- 
esting. Other illustrations, and an index pre- 
pared by Miss Toulmin Smith, together with a 
list of Allingham's works, are also provided.

The Case Against Government 
Ownership.* 



" Municipal Ownership in Great Britain " 
and " The British State Telegraphs " are the 
titles of the second and third volumes in a series 
of five books which Professor Hugo Meyer, 
formerly of the University of Chicago, has 
vmdertaken to write on public regulation and 
government ownership and operation of the 
public-service industries — the railway, the tele- 
graph, the street railway, the electric light, and 
the telephone. The first volume, published 
more than a year ago, dealt with government 
regulation of railway rates, and attracted special 
attention on account of the author's strong 
opposition to such regulation. 

The volume on " Municipal Ownership " 
covers rather fully the industries of street rail- 
ways, gas, and electric light, and altogether con- 
tains a formidable argument against the policy 
indicated by the title. That policy, the author 
maintains, has wellnigh paralyzed street-railway 
building in the United Kingdom and placed 
the tramway industry on a losing financial basis. 
Comparing English and American conditions, 
he reaches the conclusion that the people living 
in the cities and towns of the United Kingdom 
have at their service less than a quarter of the 
street-railway facilities enjoyed by people living 
in the towns and cities of the United States 
(p. 91). Had the urban population of the 
United Kingdom, in January, 1906, been as 
well supplied with electric street-railways as 
was the urban population of the United States 
in 1902, he affirms, the United Kingdom would 
have had, not 3040 miles of electric street- 
railway track, but 14,000 miles (p. 301). Taking

the much-discussed Glasgow system as a specific 
iUustration, the author shows that this city and 
its suburbs, containing a population of upwards 
of a million inhabitants, has less than 140 miles 
of street-railway track (p. 74) — facilities which 
do not begin to compare with those of Amer- 
ican cities. Moreover, he says, if the facilities 
were greater the people of Glasgow would be 
unable to use them, because the system of 
graded fares, which for suburban residents 
woidd be the equivalent of six, seven, or eight 
cents, would be practically prohibitive (p. 108). 
The situation with regard to the gas and 
electric-lighting industries. Professor Meyer in- 
sists, is little if any better. Two hundred and 
eighty municipalities in the United Kingdom 
own their gas-plants, of which only forty per cent 
are on a paying basis (p. 174). Compared with 
the United States, the electric light facilities of 
the United Kingdom are grossly inadequate. 
In June, 1902, there were, he says, 3620 central 
electric stations in American cities as against 
457 in 1904 in British municipalities (p. 261). 
After British cities had " paralyzed individual 
initiative and private adventure " by municipal 
ownership, the cities themselves declined to step 
in and supply the needed facilities which other- 
wise would have been provided. The cities of 
Great Britain, the author asserts, have thus far 
shown themselves incapable of utilizing fully 
the industries given them ready-made by the 
American captains of industry. They have 
failed to " suburbanize " their populations by 
means of adequate transportation facilities, and 
have thereby shown an " indifference to and a 
disregard of the public health, physical as well 
as moral, that for brutality have no parallel in 
the records of private industry." Scarcely less 
brutal, he contends, is the disregard by British 
cities of the welfare of the hundred thousand 
people who might find employment in the 
electrical industries if the cities would but re- 
move their paralyzing hand (p. 324). Professor 
Meyer's conclusions are as follows : 

« The upshot of thirty-five years of action upon the 
doctrine that the public service industries that make 
use of the public streets differ from ordinary trading 
and manufacturing ventures, and must be made to share 
their profits with the public at large, is that the people 
of the United Kingdom have at their disposal about 
one-quarter the street railway facilities, one-third the 
electric lighting facilities, and less than one-quarter 
the telephone facilities, that they would have to have 
before they could be said to be as well supplied with 
these facilities as are the people of the United States." 

Professor Meyer's third volume, like the 
second, might well be styled " the case against 
government ownership," for his indictment 



against state ownership of the telegraph is no 
less strong than that against the municipaliza- 
tion of the street railways. It will be remem- 
bered that the British government took over 
the telegraph lines of the United Kingdom in 
1870, paying therefor $40,000,000, which Mr. 
Meyer thinks was excessive (p. 5). The com- 
plaints against private ownership and operation 
were that the charges were too high, a fact 
which tended to check the growth of telegraphic 
correspondence ; that there were frequent de- 
lays of messages ; that many important com- 
munities were unprovided with telegraphic facil- 
ities ; and that in many places the telegraph 
office was inconveniently remote from the centre 
of business. It was pointed out that the expe- 
rience of Belgium and Switzerland with state 
ownership had been very successful, having 
greatly stimulated the growth of telegraphic 
correspondence by a substantial reduction of 
charges. But, according to Mr. Meyer, the 
expectations of the friends of state ownership in 
England have not been realized. The revenues 
have, with rare exceptions, fallen below the 
amount estimated, while the expenses of opera- 
tion have been excessive (pp. 87, 386). On the 
whole, he concludes that the verdict of British 
experience under public ownership and operation 
has shown the doctrine to be untenable. Instead 
of purifjring politics it has corrupted politics bj^ 
giving a great impetus to the " insidious practice 
of class bribery " (p. 387). In one respect he 
admits that nationalization of the telegraph has 
met the expectations of its advocates, — namely, 
in the enormous extension of telegraphic corre- 
spondence, though too often this relates to mat- 
ters the encouragement of which by the state may 
well be open to question.

EAR J. Percy and His Dinner-Guests.* 



In "Earl Percy's Dinner - Table " Mr. 
Murdock has produced an unusual book — an 
historical monograph possessing both unques- 
tionable authenticity and rare distinction of 
style. Its plan and the stately classicism of 
its style suggest Landor's " Imaginary Conver- 
sations "; its method of research, Mr Austin 
Dobson's " Eighteenth Century Vignettes." A 
light touch, a vivid imagination, a gift for the 
illuminating epithet that shall paint a character, 
picture a scene, or produce an atmosphere, — 
these are the qualities that distinguish Mr.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



Murdock's little book. Already known as the 
author of several important historical works, 
he now shows that he can clothe dry bones and 
make them live, — not in the hackneyed form 
of historical fiction but as a rare and refreshing 
bit of imaginative history. Issued as one of the 
Riverside Press special editions, the volume is 
printed and bound in a fashion that suits its 
unusual quality. The only illustration is the 
frontispiece, which shows an engraved portrait 
of Earl Percy by Sidney L. Smith, from a print 
in the author's possession, combined, within a 
graceful border, with a modern vignette of the 
Earl's dinner-table. 

Mr. Murdock has chosen the dinner-table in 
Earl Percy's Winter Street house as a conven- 
ient vantage-point from which to survey the life 
of Boston in 1774. The episode falls into three 
parts : the first, opening with a vivid account 
of the landing of Percy's regiment in Boston, 
characterizes the Earl and a group of his officers, 
and relates, as an extract from the (non-existent) 
journal of Captain William Glanville Evelyn 
of " The King's Own," the conversation at one 
of the Earl's dinners ; the second is concerned 
with the battles of Concord and Bunker Hill 
and the dark days that followed, when, for 
obAdous reasons, " dinner-giving was going out 
of fashion in Boston," and the evacuation of the 
town was only a matter of time ; the third is in 
the nature of an after-piece, sketching briefly 
the future careers — in America, England, or 
India — of the gallant group of officers who had 
been wont to gather around Earl Percy's hos- 
pitable board. 

The chief authorities for the more original 
features of the narrative are Earl Percy's own 
letters, those of John Andrews, Mrs. Boscawen, 
Lady Sarah Bunbury, and others, and the files 
of the Boston newspapers of the day, — sources 
which are indicated in an appendix of notes. 
A complete bibliography would extend to alarm- 
ing proportions, and include every available 
book, pamphlet, and document ; for it is evident 
that the easy, unstudied manner of the narrative 
is due to the author's perfect acquaintance not 
only with the episodes which his book touches 
upon but also with the entire history of the 
period. 

In its main outlines, the story of the Boston 
siege is as familiar as any in our history ; but 
with the stately Earl Percy in the foregTound, 
in place of Paul Revere and the Concord minute- 
men, it takes on a fresh interest. The Earl 
wrote home of Boston, — its people, whom he 
called " a set of sly, artfid, hypocritical rascalls, 



cruel, and cowards," and its climate, which took 
him to " the Torrid and Frigid Zone frequently 
in the space of 24 hours." In order that he 
might enjoy the scenery of the suburbs he bought 
a riding-horse, for which he paid X450, and sent 
to New York " for a pair of chaise horses that 
were to liis mind." Then he rented a house, 
pleasantly situated within its garden at the head 
of Whiter Street, and was ready to play the host 
" to the officers of the Line and occasionally 
the Gentlemen of the Country." 

" It is pleasant to see him crossing the Common each 
afternoon to do the honors of his mansion, and day hy 
day and week by week it is interesting to watch his 
guests passing in and out the great door. It opens to 
officers in scarlet and gold, and to officers in the blue of 
the Royal Navy, to gentlemen in silk and brocade, and 
to gentlemen in velvet and lace. Old Dr. Caner goes 
up the path leaning upon his stick, the great coach of 
Colonel Royall lumbers up to the garden gate, the chaise 
of Judge Lee waits in Winter Street to cany his Honor 
back to Cambridge. All those who love the King within 
this stern old New England town rejoice in the polite 
summons that brings them to Earl Percy's dinner-table." 

At the particular dinner that Captain Evelyn 
describes, the civilian element was ably repre- 
sented by the Reverend Mather Byles, preacher, 
poet, and mt, arrant Tory and so "in the eyes 
of the army the most sensible as well as the 
most delightful clergyman in Boston." The 
other places were filled by army and navy 
officers, invited to meet Lord Percy's boy friend, 
young Roger Sheaffe, who is about sailing for 
England to study for a commission. 

" The Earl has presented him to-night to his future 
comrades of the army, and the radiant face of the boy 
must be a pleasant sight in his lordship's eyes." 

Pleasant banter over the boy's ambition to 
-' wear the red coat " runs around the table. 
Doctor Byles's witty sallies throw old Major 
Pitcaim into convtdsions of mirth. Local 
affairs, London scandal and literary gossip fur- 
nish topics of conversation. The Earl, who pre- 
sides gracefully, asks Dr. Byles if he admires 
the verse of Dr. Goldsmith, lately deceased. 

" Dr. Byles replied that he regarded Goldsmith as an 
ingenious man of excellent promise, though not to be 
compared with his old friend and correspondent, Mr. 
Pope." 

Then Earl Percy spoke of his family's connec- 
tion with the poet, and Captain Harry Fox, 
Lord Holland's " only good son," recalled his 
brother Charles's acquaintance with him. 

" He feared that the poet's death had been hastened 
by the burden of heavy debts. Here Gould muttered 
in my ear to wonder whether, if Lord Holland had not 
come to the financial relief of Charles Fox, that portly 
gambler would have been crushed as easily as the 
Duke's scribbling friend from Grub Street."

THE DIAl^

It is all veiy courtly and care-free ; but when 
the time for work comes these leisurely diners- 
out prove themselves excellent fighters. As for 
Earl Percy's scornful estimate of the colonists, 
he was prompt to revise it on the evidence of 
April nineteenth, in writing of which he paid 
high and generous tribute to their courage and 
perseverance. Mr. Murdoch describes the Earl 
reviewing his brigade on the morning of that 
fateful day. 

" And the expression on his Lordship's face is not tlie 
one we find in Mr. Stuart's painting, nor that familiar 
to guests at his dinner-table." 

But the Earl and his friends were not yet 
discouraged. Dinner-giving went merrily on 
in Boston, with the choice of guests greatly 
augumented by the advent of many frightened 
loyalists and the arrival of the frigate Cerberus. 
" One is tempted to glance again into the old dining- 
room and mark the new faces that gather there, to hear 
Colonel Saltonstall and Mr. Vassall lament the incon- 
veniences of the time, to hear Clinton tell his memories 
of the fighting Prince of Brunswick, and listen to Bur- 
goyne's graceful and racy recital of the gossip that is 
amusing high life in London." 

But soon came the disillusionment of Bunker 
Hill, and then, after a long cold winter — enliv- 
ened chiefly by Burgoyne's ^vit as a playwright 
— the evacuation, and the scattering of Earl 
Percy's dinner-guests to the four comers of the 
earth. It is the best possible evidence of Mr. 
Murdock's art that we read of their future careers 
with interest, and part from them, after so slight 
an acquaintance, as from friends.

A Max from Maine.* 



In the political lingo of a few years ago 
" The man from Maine " was a very common 
expression ; but it did not mean the man who 
is really best entitled to rank as Maine's prime 
contribution to American statesmanship. The 
name of William Pitt Fessenden has figured 
little in the press of the present generation, nor 
have the writers of United States histories made 
it familiar to the children of the public schools. 
The appearance of his biography, however, will 
awaken very vivid recollections in the minds of 
men who lived through the Civil War and the 
troubled era of Reconstruction. Blaine and 
Thomas B. Reed come most readily to mind 
to-day, when the State of Maine is mentioned ; 
but it lay not in the character of Blaine nor in 

* Life and Public Services op William Pitt Fessenden. 
By his son, Francis Fessenden. In two volumes. Boston: 
Houghton. Mifflin & Co. 



the opportunities of Reed — perhaps not in the 
native ability or acquired knowledge of either - — 
to render to the country the enormous and vital 
services rendered by Fessenden during the eight 
years which remained to him after the outbreak 
of the Civil War. As one thinks of the long- 
train of evils which traces straight back to the 
sins and blunders of Civil War finance, it might 
not seem propitious to recall the fact that Senator 
Fessenden was Chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee during the entire war period, except 
for the few months when he held the Treasury 
portfolio after the resignation of Secretary Chase . 
The fact was, however, that his keen financial 
instinct scented the essential rottenness of every 
serious fallacy proposed, and these fallacies be- 
came a part of our law and practice only in 
cases where his wise advice went down before 
the unwisdom of superior numbers. The issue 
of legal-tender notes was against all his ideas of 
financial good sense and national honor ; and 
though compelled by the attitude of his Com- 
mittee to report the bill, he supported a motion 
to strike out the legal-tender clause on the floor of 
the Senate. During the months of his service as 
Secretary of the Treasury, 1864-65, he success- 
fidly resisted all demands for currency inflation, 
not a dollar being added to the amount outstand- 
ing at his accession. It was his influence that 
secured the act of March 3, 1865, forbidding 
the further issue of legal tenders ; and one of 
his first services on returning to the Senate was 
to lead through that body, against the opposi- 
tion of John Sherman, a bill to hasten the 
elimination of this dangerous element from our 
financial system. By 1868, however, misguided 
public clamor swept the Senate from its moor- 
ings and Fessenden was one of but four who 
had the moral courage to stand out against the 
repeal of this wise provision. That much of 
the financial folly and disaster of the past forty 
years might liave been spared but for the throw- 
ing overboard of the trained pilot, is the opinion 
of practically every well-equipped student of our 
financial history to-day. 

But the crowning display of Senator Fessen- 
den's sound sense and moral courage was his 
defeat — for it was essentially his — of the ill- 
advised movement to get rid of a politically 
obnoxious President by impeachment. The case 
is all the more striking in that Fessenden, though 
a thoroughly kind man at heart, was by tem- 
perament extremely irritable under the stimulus 
of just such foolish conduct as President John- 
son was continually perpetrating, and there was 
really no more effective opponent of all the 



74

[Feb. 1, 



President's distinctive policies in the entire 
Senate than Fessenden himself. As one reads 
his private letters during this trying period, as 
well as his public utterances, it is clear that his 
merely human impulses were urging him all the 
time toward conviction, not because conviction 
was the thunderous demand of his party, but 
because the President's course was in almost 
all its essential features utterly repugnant to 
his ideas of right and of the country's welfare. 
But over against all this was the one fact of his 
sworn obligation as an honest man to decide 
the case before him in xigid accordance with the 
law and the evidence. It would be hard to find 
a more temperate, dignified, and utterly crush- 
ing rejoinder, than his reply to a clamorous 
letter from Neal Dow, demanding that he should 
" hang Johnson up by the heels like a dead 
crow in a cornfield, to frighten all his tribe." 
" Eternal infamy^'' roared Ben Butler, " unless 
yon vote to convict ! " And perhaps four- 
fifths of Fessenden's constituents were suffi- 
ciently carried away by the excitement of the 
moment to echo Butler's words. Forty years 
have passed since then. Blaine long ago apolo- 
gized at length, in his " Twenty Years in Con- 
gress," for the part that he had taken in the 
Impeachment movement; and his change of 
heart was shared by many another after passion 
had time to cool. The moral consciousness of 
Maine had largely righted itself towards its 
greatest and purest statesman within the one 
short year of life which remained to him after 
the famous trial closed, and it would be hard 
to find a sane man in the land to-day who would 
not be willing to have the career of William 
Pitt Fessenden held up to his sons as a worthy 
example of upright, intelligent, and patriotic 
manhood. As for Butler, dealing out his 
thunderbolts of eternal disgrace to those who 
woidd not fall in with a programme of pas- 
sionate partisanship of which he may now be 
recognized as a thorouglily fitting leader — what 
better fate than silence can his great misuse of 
o-reat talents ever hope for ? As one reads over 
Fessenden's recorded opmion m this historic 
case, together with the extracts which his biog- 
rapher includes from that of Sumner, he is forced 
to the conviction that here is a moral height 
which even Sumner, through his inability to 
control some of the prejudices and weaknesses 
which fastened themselves upon one of the great- 
est minds and hearts of the age, was unable to 
reach. 

Fessenden's name, as has already been said, 
is not a part of the mental furniture of to-day. 



nor is his quiet and unassuming style of virtue 
exactly that which appeals to the popular taste in 
an age which admires men who " do things " more 
noisily than he, if not always more successfully. 
It is unfortunate, therefore, that his biography 
could not have had the benefit of competent 
literary training as well as filial affection. Still, 
after shortcomings on that score are discounted, 
one finds in this story of a public man who never 
" put his ear to the ground " to listen for the 
voice of duty, never "climbed into the band- 
wagon " in search of office, never chose to go 
against his conscientious judgment a hair's 
breadth rather than " get left," a piece of biog- 
raphy so morally invigorating as to deserve, in 
its own very different way, a place alongside 
the reminiscences of Carl Schurz.

Recent Poetry.* 



The " New Poems " of Mr. Stephen Phillips will 
not add materially to his reputation, but they main- 
tain a fairly high level of performance. Always 
serious, and a master of the note of tremulous pas- 
sion, this poet knows how to impart his mood to 
others, and bear them away upon the wings of his 
imagination. This power may be illustrated by a 
passage from his " Endymion " — the passage con- 
veying Selene's invitation to the shepherd. 
" Wilt thou come, 

And drift upon this bosom through the deep ? 

Say, wilt thou lead a life which, though less bright, 

Is beautiful to those of noon aweary, 

The rarer day of spirits exquisite '? 

Is it so little ocean to allure, 

Or rise in silence on the battle-field ; 

To soothe the spires and steeples of the world, 

Or the blue-darting pyramids ; to clothe 

In lovely raiment even the starkest crag ; 

Make the Sahara like a lily bloom, 

A huge and delicate flower ; to reconcile 

The coldest hills ; to fill the gaps of stone. 

To glaze with glory intervals of Time ; 

To breathe into the bones of cities dead 

An argent soul, reweave the passionate halls 

Where waves the grass, and prostrate empires old 

Raise into trembling immortality ? " 

This fine appeal offers several examples of verbal 
infelicity, and one verse sets u s wondering what

Selene could have known of "spires and steeples," 
but it is an impressive passage for all that, and con- 
tains the essence of poetry. Mr. Phillips, as we 
have long since learned, has the power of re-stating 
the themes of old-world history and legend in terms 
that have just the touch of modern imagination 
needed for the renewal of theii' freshness. Other 
examples in this volume are the poems on Orestes, 
on Guenevere, on the Lady Edith seeking Harold's 
body at Senlac, and the one-act Corinthian tragedy 
that rounds out the book. Left entirely to his own 
resources, Mr. Phillips does not seem to us a verte- 
brate poet, but he can drape the limbs of old romance 
in very graceful folds. 

A second series of Mr. Charles F. Grindrod's 
"Songs from the Classics" includes poems upon 
a number of Greek myths — CEdipus, Tithonus, 
Hermes, Iphigenia, and half a dozen others. They 
are narratives rather than songs, although they con- 
tain an element of philosophical lyricism. This may 
be illustrated by a stanza from the Oedipus poem. 

" Life's book is still a wonder to our wit — 

Here torn, there faded, blurred its lettered gold. 
Fainter the writing on the scroll 
Shows as the parchment we unroll ; 
And what we read is like a tale half-told, 
Lost the beginning, and the end unwrit." 

This is not much more than commonplace, and we 
quote it mainly as an example of a peculiar stanzaic 
form. Another form affected by the author is em- 
ployed in the Iphigenia poem, and is illustrated by 
this stanza of the maiden's plaint. 

" O star-crowned Artemis I O purest light 

That burns in heaven I Whose rays divine 

Ever on hapless maidens shine ! 

Thou who dost sail the flame-fringed sky 

Cloudless in thy virginity ! — 
Stoop from thy silver car that climbs the night, 
And let my grief be gladdened with thy sight ! " 

"In Grasmere Vale, and Other Poems," is a 
small volume of verse by Mr. James A. Mackereth. 
The titular poem suggests Wordsworth, and yields 
these sympathetic stanzas of tribute and invocation. 

" Spirit ! of passion all unblown, 

And eminent o'er things that cloy, 
Oh, teach us something of thine own 
Tranquillity and joy ! 

" Teach us our souls to guard and keep. 
To feel when onward rudely hurled 
Through cities, when we laugh and weep, 
The gladness of the world. 

" Lead us by paths that folly flies, 

From random gauds that daze our youth 
To that simplicity that lies 
Upon the breast of Truth ! " 

This is of a piece with the utterance of such latter- 
day Wordsworthians as Arnold and Mr. Watson. 
But we find also in the new poet the Meredithian 
note of rapture. 

" I will get me again to clean-smelling moorlands and fells, 
And gather the wisdom I squandered far off in my youth. 
And gaze in the fond tender faces where innocence dwells, 
And kindness and truth ; 



And be glad with the winds and the waters, with the birds 

and the trees and the flowers, 
And taste yet again with delight the munificent hours. 

" I will take the glad earth to wife, 

Will claim her green bosom for bed, 
I will drink at the freshets of life. 
And beauty shall be to me bread." 

Thus the slow gravity of the Wordsworthian concep- 
tion of nature is quickened by the modern spirit of 
the joy of living, and that which was to the older 
poet a refuge becomes to the younger one an ani- 
mated and responsive personality. We even get an 
echo of Mr. Swinburne in the stanzas on " Man and 
the Sea," the last of which is this : 

" to be one for the space of an hour with thee, breath of 
thy breath. 
Wild with the might of thy joy, and tempestuously hurled. 
One with thy wonderful waves, proud scomer of death, 
Queen-bride of the world I " 

In fact, Mr. Mackereth sometimes seems to scorn 
the Wordsworthian temper that he elsewhere lauds, 
and to repudiate the very thought of resignation. 
The following lines, addressed to the poet (generi- 
cally speaking), might have been penned by Henley. 

" For thee the elevation and the calm, 
The aloofness that, not unallied to pain, 
Feeds on supernal sorrows, and drinks deep 
Of joys denied to mortals. Hence for thee 
The far-off acclamations of the stars, 
And spiritual benedictions, and soft peace ; 
For me the tramp, the tumult, and the cry, 
The curse from loud lips flung, the tyrant's rage, 
The sinUe from frailty foully overborne. 
For thee the ethereal pomp and proud repose ; 
For me the laughter of comrades, tear and toil, 
The inspiring clasp of life -warm human hands, 
Hope, hate, strong love — the throbbing whole of life, 
The blow, the sting, the rush magnificent. 
Toward that one breach, piled with God's vehement dead, 
Where Death the archer waits behind the wall ! " 

Mr. M. Compton Mackenzie, in his " Poems," 
affects the pastoral convention. 

" Come, my Corinna, come with me and live 
Away in some far-hidden pastoral nook ; 
Stay not, Corinna, you and I could give 
The very scythe of Time an easeful look. 
I have a grey house set beside a stream, 
With casements opening on the West and East ; 
There may you live and there forever dream 
Till swallows flit no more and flowers have ceased." 

Thus pleasantly does the volume open, inviting the 
reader no less than Corinna to its pages. The alter- 
nate rhyme is Mr. Mackenzie's favorite mode of 
expression, varied now and then by terza rima, or 
the more complicated arrangements of the sonnet. 
We are greatly taken with the stanzas on " Love in 
November." 

" To-day the world is chill with stagnant breath, 
Life is a web of half-forgotten dreams. 
The year a way-worn traveller nigh to death : 
The winter-weary winds, the sighing streams, 
Are like the voices of the thin moonbeams ; 
The haughty sun is now no longer king. 
Love is the only constant thing, it seems ; 
We two who love may still remember Spring.

•' And yet how long it is, since you and I 
Went, hand in hand, to watch for one fair liour 
The river's silver shadows sweeping by. 
For us a moment's sadness Avas a shower, 
A moment's joy the beauty of a flower. 
Ah, sweet I can you remember that lost kiss 
When we were lord and lady of Love's tower, 
So high we seemed above the world's abyss ? " 

Ease and amplitude, picturesqueness and imagina- 
tion, are the qualities of Mr. Mackenzie's exquisite 
verse. His taste is wellnigh faultless, and his feel- 
ing for rhythm leaves little to be desired. The seri- 
ous note prevails, but is occasionally forgotten, as 
in these stanzas to the memory of a favorite bulldog. 

"Thou need'st not any longer fear the snow, 
And howl despondent when the driving rain 
Bids thee frequent the rug and fireside-glow. 
Or draws thee hopeless to the window pane : 
For thee all Winters have long gone before. 
And endless Springs await thee evermore. 

" For now across an amaranthine field 
The spirits of bad rabbits flee thy bark, 
And haply some dread fox, sent unannealed 
Below, is chased into the outer dark, 
Where spectral traps and ghostly g^s abound. 
And through the gloom the hostile horns resound. 



" And when we shiver by the Stygian mere 
Above the lamentations thi-ough the dark. 
Upon the bank remote, shall we not hear 
A hollow and attenuated bark ? 
Then with the hero-dogs we '11 see thee stand 
Alert to greet us on the murky strand." 

Mr. Mackenzie's sonnets number hardly more than 
a dozen, but each is a gem. "The Lilies of the 
Field " shall be our selection, reluctantly leaving the 
beauty of the others to be inferred. 

•• Thy soul is not enchanted by the moon ; 
No influential comet draws thy mind 
To steeps intolerable where all behind 
Is dark, and many ruined stars are strewn. 
But thou, contented, canst enthrall the tune 
That haunts each wood and every singing wind ; 
Thou, fortunate philosopher, canst find 
The dreams of Earth in every drowsy noon. 

" Match not thy soul against the seraphim ; 
They are no more than moths blown to and fro 
About the tempest of the eternal Will. 
Rest undismayed in field and forest dim 
And, childlike, on some morning thou shalt know 
The certain faith of a March daffodil." 

Mr. Gilder's volumes are small but numerous, 
and " The Fire Divine " is the ninth to bear his 
name. The contents are occasional pieces for the 
most part, and Mr. Gilder is one of the happiest of 
our poets when it comes to the penning of a suitable 
tribute to an event or a person. It may perhaps 
be said that his tendency in this species of composi- 
tion is to let emotion get the better of thought, or 
to allow the idea to become obscured in a mist of 
sentiment. But better this defect (if it be one) 
than the fault of viewing the subject in too dry a 
light. Mr. Gilder's " Under the Stars," which is a 
requiem for Saint-Gaudens, is the most elaborate of 



the memorial poems now published, 
two of the fourteen stanzas. 



We extract 



" Ye stars ; all music to the spirits eai' I 
Before the imperial music-masters knelt 
This master of an art sublime, austere ; 
The very soul of music in him dwelt. 
So in his lines the haunting strains of lyres. 
From gracious forms deep tones symphonic spring ; 
Once more we liear the sound of heavenly wires. 
Again the stars of morn together sing. 



" fateful stars ! that led the climbing way 
Of that dear, martyred son of fate and fame, — 
The supreme soul of an immortal day, — 
Linked with his name is our great scidptor's name 
For now in art eternal breathes again 
The gaunt, sweet presence of our chief of men, — 
That soul of tenderness, that spirit stem. 
Whose fires divine forever flame and burn." 

Among the brief tributary poems we may mention 
those inscribed to Schurz, Aldrich, Mrs. Josephine 
Shaw Lowell, and Mr. Edward McDowell. Each 
of these strikes exactly the right note, and at the 
same time indicates how fine and high are the poet's 
own ideals. Now and then, irregvxlar rhythms are 
essayed in this volume, and even poems in prose, 
but these experiments we cannot regard as upon the 
level of the work done in accordance with the rules 
of the poetic art. 

Another of the small volumes that Mr. Clinton 
Scollard modestly puts forth from year to year has 
come to hand. It is called '' Blank Verse Pastels," 
which indicates that it invites the severest of tests, 
for the poetic gift may be most certainly measured 
when the poet renounces the adventitious aid of 
rhyme. We can pay Mr. Scollard no better tribute 
than to say that he seems to us more of a poet than 
ever in the pages of this little book. There are 
about thirty poems, few exceeding a single page in 
length. We select "Sleep, the Almoner" for 
quotation. 

" Adowu the voids and vastnesses of night 
Haste thou to me, almoner of Rest ! 
Come with thy fardel full of fairest dreams. 
And strew them round about me, as the spring 
Scatters the cloistral wake-robins in May ; 
For I am over-weary, and would dwell 
Only with fantasy ; woidd droop and drowse 
Lulled as with lutes : would lie on blossom-beds 
Scented with savors of oblivion ; 
Down paradisal streams would glide 'neath sails 
Tinted like golden gonfalons ; would taste 
Honeys more luscious than are those that ooze 
From the bruised cells of Hymettean combs I 
All this for gift is thine, O almoner ; 
Then speed thee on thy pinions, snow-fall soft. 
Adown the voids and vastnesses of night ! " 

Mr. Scollard shifts from iambics to trochaics and

A pensive mood, expressing itself now by means

harsh realism, is found in " The Passing of Time,"

unrhymed measures are the rule, as may be seen 
in the lines entitled "Ashes." 

" Clouds of soft grey and whitened smoke arise 
From the rieh pasturage and fertile meadow land 
Where the sere grass and wreckage of the Winter lies 

aflame, 
Ascending to the sun in holocaust of glory 
That new glory should appear out of the ashes of the 

funeral pyre. 

" Strange mystery of nature's power, 
One dying that another should be bom, 
One bom to bring another death, 
Death after life, and life from death, 
Winter to dissolution sinks; and Spring is born." 

This verges upon platitude, and yet is not without 
its charm. In this minor key, Mr. Thomson sings 
the phases of the day and the seasons of the chang- 
ing year. 

A sheaf of lyrics and somiets called " Semitones," 
by " A. A. C," is marked by graceful sentiment and 
tender feeling. What could be prettier, in their way, 
than these simple stanzas : 

" So many things I longed to say 

To her who is my heart's delight, 
I said them over day by day, 

I held them in my mind at night. 

" But, when at last the moment came 

That I so long had wished might come, * 
Before Love's burning altar-flame 

My tongue was mute, my lips were dumb." 

Here is a poem, perhaps not more serious, of graver 
import. 

" Thine ear is deaf, no errant word. 
In all the ages that are gone. 
Of all our praying hast Thou heard ; 
Of all our mournful cries, not one. 

" Thy lips are dumb, no voice of Thine 
The endless, envious years have known ; 
Unto our sight has come no sign, 
Unto our waiting ears no tone. 

" Thine anthem priest and pagan sing ; 
They gather round Thine altar-flame ; 
They worship, to whose worshiping 
No benediction ever came. 

" They nsime with awe Thy dread abode ; 
Thy dwelling they decree so far 
That all must perish by the road 
In Thought that leaps from star to star." 

But with the "Anthem" comes the "Antiphone." 

" They search too far who seek Thee there. 
When Thou art near in flower and sheaf ; 
Thou art the answer and the prayer, 
Alike believer and belief." 

The sonnets in this collection are singularly fine, 
and perhaps the finest of them all is the " Atlantis." 

" Who has not seen it, high in heaven set, 
Cutting the skies in lines as clearly drawn 
As when, from Bordighera's grove at dawn, 
Far Corsica is seen in silhouette ! 

Vision of purple cloud and jjarapet ; 
Look well upon it ere the light be gone, 
For there thy dearest hope is held in pawn ; 
It is the palace of thine own regret. 



There is the land that lured thee to delight. 
Stretching away beyond those luminous spires ; 
Enchanted river, wood and waterfall, 
All vanishing upon the verge of night : 
Behold the home of all thy lost desires ! 
Look upon Lethe flowing by the wall ! " 

There is a ripeness about these pieces that betokens 
maturity of reflective thought, and the fact that one 
of the poems, by admission, was written more than 
forty years ago, shows that the distillation of a long 
life is contained in the slender vial now offered us.

The memoirs of '^^^ man who could hold his position 
Monsieur Claud e,a,s commissary of police and after- 
French detective, ^ards as chief of police through the 
kaleidoscopic changes of government under Louis 
Philippe, the short-lived second Republic, the Second 
Empire, and the Commune must have been either 
very flexible or very fortunate ; at all events he 
was very much of a personage, and could utter his 
quorum pars maffna fui with something more than 
poetic approximation to truth. Such a personage 
was Monsieur Claude, whose memoirs, published in 
1881, attracted considerable attention throughout 
Europe, and added much surprising material to the 
history of those troublous times. The memoirs were 
published in ten volumes, the first five of which 
bring the story down to the Siege of Paris and the 
Commune of 1871. The contents of these five 
volumes have now been condensed and translated 
into English by Miss Katharine Prescott Wormeley. 
The result is a handsome volume of over 300 pages, 
entitled " Memoirs of Monsieur Claude " (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.) . The author entered the public service 
in 1830 as a clerk in the Tribunal of the Seine ; and 
his rise, aided by his tact, shrewdness, good-nature, 
and what he modestly calls his flair for tracking 
criminals, was rapid. At the time of Orsini's 
murderous attempt on the Emperor's life (1858) 
Claude's promptness of action, based on private 
information, was rewarded by his appointment as 
chief of the ci'iminal and detective police. This 
position he held during the rest of Napoleon III.'s 
ill-starred reign ; and he rendered signal service to 
the Emperor at several critical junctures. Of his 
various adventures — worthy of Vidocq and Javert 
combined — when pursuing criminals of high or low 
degree, he speaks with a cheery self-appreciation 
which is quite infectious ; and we find him in every 
episode occupying the centre of the stage. Cer- 
tainly there are no other heroes in these picturesque 
pages : " I have seen, after the events of June, 
1848, — I have seen with my own eyes Prince Louis 
Napoleon Bonaparte, at that very time aspiring 
to the imperial purple, appear in the box of the 
theatre with his face and hands dirty, to curry favor 
with the sovereign people in the gallery. I have

seen Victor Hugo, standing on one foot, refuse a 
stool offered him from below by the malicious 
B^ranger, that he might continue the cynosure of 
all the eyes of the adoring crowd that acclaimed him 
from the gallery. I have seen Rachel, the greatest 
tragedienne of modern times, who had had for her 
Maecenases the courtiers of the most liberal of 
monarchies, sing the ' Marseillaise ' before the foot- 
lights, and then drive off in the carriage of the 
Caesars to the imperial palace." There are here 
related — and probably authentically — the details 
of some of the great crimes that shocked the middle 
of the nineteenth century ; and the detective work 
by which many of them were uncovered and their 
perpetrators captured would have done credit to 
the deductive processes of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 
The translation, as might be expected from Miss 
Wormeley, is spirited and idiomatic ; and the book is 
illustrated with portraits of Napoleon III., his family, 
Thiers, De Morny, Bdranger, and other notabilities. 

„.,, , It is a curious fact that almost all of 

Mtlton and . . , ,. -._., 

a study of the critical literature on Milton s 

the epic form. poetry is of the general essay char- 
acter. The work of the poet of Puritanism has 
called forth comparatively little of that form of liter- 
ary investigation which one may call specialized 
studies. Those who have observed this lack in the 
literature on Milton wUl be interested in Miss 
Marianna WoodhuU's new book "The Epic of 
Paradise Lost " (Putnam). The volume contains 
a series of twelve essays, which embody the results 
of scholarly investigation as well as a good deal of 
original thinking. The author's purpose is to 
establish the thesis that Milton's treatment of Adam's 
fall was demanded by the principles of the art-form 
he chose, and that his abandonment of the tragic 
form which he at first proposed to himself, grew out 
of his recognition of the " inevitable " distinction that 
separates the epic poem from the tragedy. " Paradise 
Lost," therefore, is not to be explained on the 
ground that Milton had an epic type of mind. What 
these principles of the epic are — to which the poet 
makes reference in the ninth book of " Paradise 
Lost" — is interpreted by Miss Woodhull in her first 
two essays on " What is an Epic ? " and " The 
Christian Epic." The distinction between the epic 
and the tragic theme is found to lie not only in the 
largeness of the epic's scope and background, but 
also in its superiority as a medium for presenting 
such philosophical subjects as the problem of evil, 
free-will, and the plan of salvation for man. In her 
third essay the author presents in a scholarly and 
satisfactory way the parallelism of thought between 
the poet's prose essay, " A Treatise on Christian 
Doctrine," and his epic of " Paradise Lost." The 
artistic insight which led him to -discard the tragic 
treatment of his theme, and which prevented 
Shakespeare from ever attempting it, was not shared 
in the same degree by other writers. This fact leads 
the author into an examination of four other seven- 
teenth century versions of man's fall, whose inade- 



quacy is explained by their development upon the 
tragic rather than upon the epic model. These are 
Grotius's " Adamus Exsul," Vondel's " Lucifer " 
and " Adam in Ballingschap," and Andreini's 
" L'Adamo." From the analyses given of these 
plays, the contention is well sustained that tragedy 
as such is too concrete, too limited in background and 
conception, for the successfid handling of an abstract 
theme like that of the origin of evil on the earth. 
In the tenth essay a study is made of epical pas- 
sages in Tasso's " Jerusalem Delivered," Marino's 
" Sospetto d' Herode," and in certain dramas of 
Beaumont and Fletcher, to show that these " were 
of more direct aid to Milton " than were those 
tragedies which are commonly supposed to have 
influenced him. In the twelfth essay, which closes 
the volume. Miss Woodhull presents the results of 
her investigation of the epical source of Milton's 
lyrics and the Miltonic influence on the lyric work 
of Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron. 

A Scotchman's ^he fate of Mary Stuart is a subject 
special plea for of perennial interest. Tragedy and 
Mary Stuart. mystery have always appealed to the 
nature of man, and Mary's career was both tragic 
and mysterious. Just to what extent she was respon- 
sible for the criminal plottings that have darkened 
her fame, is a much debated question. Especially 
is it difficult to determine how far she was involved 
in the plots against the life of the English queen. 
The most recent work dealing with this problem is 
a volume by Mr. Samuel Cowan entitled " The Last 
Days of Mary Stuart " (Lippincott) . The author is 
a resident of historic Perth, and has devoted a large 
part of his time and energies to the study of Scottish 
history in the sixteenth century. The work before 
us is, however, not so much a history as a lawyer's 
brief ; and the brief is remarkable neither for lucid- 
ity nor for strength. Mr. Cowan assumes that the 
documents used in convicting Mary have been 
proved to be forgeries ; there remains, therefore, 
nothing but the task of explaining certain suspicious 
circumstances and utterances that have been used 
against Mary, and this he has accomplished to his 
own evident satisfaction. He is equally facile in 
explaining the motives of the queen's enemies. 
Elizabeth hated Mary because she '' was the nearest 
heir to the crown of England, and greatly her 
superior in every human accomplishment." Burleigh 
"compromised himself with a scheme for the de- 
struction of a defenseless and innocent woman for 
no other reason than to please Elizabeth." Walsing- 
ham was the greatest villain of all ; he executed 
Babington and his eleven confederates, not for 
plotting in favor of Mary or against Elizabeth, but 
because they were in position to prove Mary's in- 
nocence. To the discussion of the supposed for- 
geries, Mr. Cowan has added very little ; he shows 
clearly how it was possible to intercept and inter- 
polate Mary's correspondence, and indicates what 
changes are thought to have been made, but fails 
to produce a convincing argument. The matter

remains where it was left by such sympathetic his- 
torians as Dr. Lingard and Mr. Andrew Lang, — a 
charge supported by certain suspicious circumstances, 
but not yet proved. The value of Mr. Cowan's 
history lies in the documentary materials that he has 
introduced ; more than half of the volume is given 
over to letters, journals, and proclamations. Of 
these, the most important is the journal of Burgoyne, 
who was Mary's physician ; this records from day to 
day the events that occurred from August 11, 1586, 
to February 8, 1587, the day of the execution. In 
publishing this narrative the author has done a real 
service to history. Some of the letters included are 
also of great interest. 

Pariiamentarv M. Hanotaux has suggested the crit- 
baltles and . . » , . . i • i i , r>i 

debates of icism or his third volume on '' Con- 

modern France, temporary France " (Putnam ) in the 
words with which he opens his second chapter : 
" M. Thiers used to say, ' We have too much politics 
in this country.' There is always a fear lest history 
should fall into the same error, and allow itself to 
be invaded by the facile abundance of parliamentary 
papers." With the exception of half a chapter on 
the war-scare of 1875, the volume is filled with 
accounts of the parliamentary battles which resulted 
in the passage of the constitutional laws, and with 
the skirmishes in the new senate and chamber of 
deputies which led to the Sixteenth of May. This 
statement is not intended as a reflection of the sort 
which would condemn the work as tedious or unin- 
structive ; such a reflection would be unjust. Indeed, 
there can be few pages of French history more inter- 
esting than the remarkably sympathetic narrative 
which M. Hanotaux has written of the way in which 
the National Assembly, a monarchical body, was 
forced, partly by public opinion skilfully interpreted 
by such men as Laboulaye and Wallon, and partly 
by the sheer impossibility of doing anything else, to 
create the constitution of the Third Republic. The 
account of the interposition, at successive crises 
of discussion, of the gentle but clear-minded M. 
Wallon, with a formula of action which accom- 
plished indirectly what the monarchist majority 
could not be persuaded to do more frankly, brings 
every element of an extremely complex situation 
before the reader. And yet, taking the volume as 
a whole, M. Hanotaux has imposed too serious a 
burden upon the reader's powers of sustained atten- 
tion. This difficulty would have been obviated had 
he not descended into minute details in dealing with 
less critical debates. Such full information upon the 
attitude of persons of secondary importance is to be 
looked for, rather, in a volume of personal memoirs. 
It would have been a relief to the attention, also, if 
more information had been given in regard to other 
phases of the history of these three years between 
1874 and 1877. The story of the war-scare serves 
the purpose in a measure, and is, besides, a valuable 
analysis of all the evidence in the case. In reference 
to this affair, one cannot escape the feeling that 
although there may have been some real danger of 



a German attack, the fears of France were excessive, 
and that the international " scare " was heightened 
by the French minister Decazes in order to place Ger- 
many, and particularly the diplomacy of Bismarck, 
at a moral disadvantage. 

The history and ^^^ .^^Ids of scientific investigation 
distribution of Combine fact and hypothesis to the 
animal life. degree that is necessitated in a study 

of the geographical distribution of animals. The 
facts are most diverse, coming as they do from vari- 
ous departments of knowledge ; and in each field, 
moreover, critical discernment of significant data and 
of the accuracy of sources is essential. In the field 
of systematic zoology and botany, the investigator 
must have a wide knowledge of range of distribution 
of many species over large areas and a keen appre- 
ciation of specific differences and relationships. He 
must not only have this familiar acquaintance with 
the living fauna and flora, but he must also have an 
equally wide grasp on the more fragmentary data 
from the fossil world, both of the region under 
investigation and of adjacent and perhaps even of 
far distant countries. To this must be added a 
critical and constructive knowledge of the geological 
evidence of the changes in the coast-lines and boun- 
daries of continents and islands in ages past, and 
probable climatic conditions which have accompanied 
those elevations and depressions of the earth's crust. 
It is a high grade of constructive imagination that is 
required to draw from this huge mass of details, 
from these diverse and often imperfect and even 
conflicting data a logical, defensible, and consistent 
presentation of the causes which underlie the dis- 
tribution of animals and plants as they exist to-day 
upon the globe, or even in a limited part of it, as, for 
example, in Europe or the British Isles. It is for 
these reasons — lack of data, and primarily the need 
of the rare combination of wide knowledge and con- 
structive imagination, — that the work of Wallace 
has stood for so many years with so few rivals in 
this field of biology. Dr. Scharff's "European 
Animals, their Geological History and Geographical 
Distribution" (Dutton) is noteworthy for the wide 
range of data drawn from these various fields and 
for a logical and consistent presentation of the salient 
facts. No treatise on the European fauna approaches 
it in the completeness and variety of its illustrative 
material, or compares with it in the grasp of the 
subject in its many-sided aspects. The combination 
of a figure of the animal or plant and a map of its 
distribution, which the author uses frequently, not 
only saves space but is very effective. The book 
has a full bibliography and a good index.

sis, is not necessarily morbid, though it may be

studied in a morbid mood." And as to the benevo- 
lent purpose of this picture of a suffering soul: 
" There are multitudes of people in like case ; the 
very confession of the fact may help others to endure, 
because one of the darkest miseries of suffering is the 
horrible sense of isolation that it brings." The hero, 
and in truth the rather unheroic hero, of Mr. Benson's 
quiet tale, is a written-out novelist (we are not told 
his name) in the pages of whose diary, from Sep- 
tember, 1888, to October, 1891, we have the record 
of his deepening gloom and his final calm submission 
to the divine will. The consciousness that creative 
power is no longer his, that the fire from heaven will 
nevermore descend upon him, is of course extremely 
painful to the diarist, and is not very cheerful in its 
effect on the reader. But as there are moods in 
which one finds Obermann a congenial spirit, so 
there are states of mind in which " The Altar Fire " 
may be read with a kind of melancholy pleasure. 
The book teaches, among other things, the insuffi- 
ciency of art when the evil days overtake one. It 
also is full of details autobiographically interesting 
to the Benson-lover. Here, as in his other works, 
the author evidently draws on the accumulated 
treasure of well-filled note-books ; and as he writes 
with a considerable experience of successful author- 
ship to look back upon, he is able to touch, lightly 
and in passing, on some of the annoyances and vani- 
ties that attend this kind of popularity. The more 
serious ills that befall his patient hero, in the way 
of bereavement and pecuniary loss, are presumably 
more purely fictitious than the mental and moral 
tribulations he is made to undergo. The aching 
sense of literai'y barrenness, after a period of fertile 
productivity, may very well be one with which Mr. 
Benson is not unfamiliar. Possibly there are some 
pages of the book that attest this more unmistakably 
than the author had intended. But as a whole the 
volume has the wonted cliarm of its writer's quietly 
reflective and genially discui'sive manner.

(Appleton) which bears decided marks of French 
influence. The author frankly states in the preface 
that he has admired Fontenelle's " Conversations on 
the Plurality of Worlds." As one reads, he is 
reminded also of the style of Flammarion. Mr. 
Serviss represents himself as talking with a lady of 
refinement and leisure, who lives by a beautiful 
private park from which tliere is a fine view of the 
sky. On the first " conversation " evening, the fuU 
moon attracts the lady's attention, and gives rise to 
various questions and explanations, the interest of 
which is heightened by a timely eclipse. The series 
of conversations about our nocturnal luminary is 
illustrated by fine photographs of its various phases ; 
and afterwards large scale photographs of certain 
striking limar formations are explained by the 
teacher to his fair pupil. Her interest is especially 



aroused by the question of possible intelligent life, in 
the past or at present, on our satellite : and though 
her ardor in this respect is continually checked by 
her instructor, she determines to buy a small tele- 
scope and hunt for evidence of the existence of 
present-day lunarians. While feminine character- 
istics are very obstrusive in tlie conversations, the 
reader may judiciously skip these, and find a wealth 
of accurate descriptive matter concerning the promi- 
nent featm'es of the lunar landscape. The twenty- 
six excellent full-page plates of the moon are made 
from photographs taken at the Yerkes Observatory. 
A good index enables one to find the description of 
any particular lunar feature.

Sermons and Addresses, Delivered in the Hall of 
Balliol College, Oxford" (Macmillan) are simple

problems of Kantian or Comtist or Aristotelian 
philosophy. Succeeding Jowett as Master of Balliol, 
but perhaps better remembered as Principal Caird 
of Glasgow University, he followed the example of 
his predecessors at the Oxford college in delivering 
a sermon or address at the opening of each academic 
year. " A nmnberof these discourses are preserved," 
he tells us in a preface to his volume, " and they are 
published at the desire of some of those who heard 
them." Twelve in number, these lay sermons, with 
two exceptions, deal with subjects of permanent 
spiritual interest, the departures from the rule being 
an address on Queen Victoria's jubilee and one after 
her death. Free from cant and full of wholesome 
counsel for daily life, especially student life, each of 
these homilies contains quotable passages of practical 
wisdom. Their general tone may be indicated by a 
brief closing extract. " We form," says the speaker, 
treating of salvation, " an ideal picture of some better 
state of the world, in which the commonplace and 
secular aspects of life have no longer any room and 
duties are at once more heroic and more easy, for- 
getting that there is no act but derives its character, 
its greatness or its pettiness, from the spirit which 
manifests itself in the doing of it. The only world 
worthy of being regarded as ideal is that which 
carries within it the present world with its meaning 
understood, and its worth deepened."

of writing biography has been long out of fashion, 
and every well-trained writer now strives to tell the 
truth about his subject. Mr. Morgan has made a 
careful study of Patrick Heniy, and has written 
with an enthusiasm that would perhaps communicate 
itself more strongly to the reader but for the too 
evident purpose to be sprightly and vivid ; the author 
also brings in many details of persons and events that 
distract attention from the main current of the nar- 
rative. Perhaps this discursiveness is due to the 
previous literary experience of the author as a writer 
of historical fiction. However, the book is one of 
interest and value as presenting anew a full-length 
portrait of one of our national heroes, and it should 
be widely read. Of especial interest are the chap- 
ters on Patrick Henry's early life, his power as 
a lawyer and as an orator, and his private life. 
Twenty-four excellent illustrations add much to the 
value and interest of the book. (Lippincott.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



« The Months," by Mr. J. V. Blake (the James H. 
West Co., Boston) is a little book of sougs and lyrics 
pictiu*ing the changing delights of the seasons. Mr. 
Blake's year begins in April, with the coming of the 
first flowers, and ends with a tribute to the blustering 
promise of March. There is nothing strikingly original 
about his sentiments, but his imagery and the rhythm 
of his verse are genei-ally pleasing. A graceful fore- 
word in prose introduces the verses descriptive of each 
month. 

To the " Oxford Edition " of the poets, published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde, three volumes have just been added. 
" The Complete Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley," 
edited by Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, makes a volume of 
over nine hundred pages. "The Complete Poetical 
Works of Thomas Campbell" are edited by Mr. J. 
Logic Robertson. Palgrave's " Golden Treasury " is 
the third volume, and includes the hmidred poems added 
by a later hand to the collection, bringing it down to the 
end of the nineteenth century. Mr. Swinburne, happily 
being still alive, is not represented, although it seems 
as if an exception to the rule of the volume might have 
been made in his ease. 

The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art has done 
students of Chinese ceramics a service by issuing an illus- 
trated " Catalogue of the Morgan Collection of Chinese 
Porcelains," revised from the original privately printed 
edition. Dr. Stephen W. Bushell, the eminent Oriental 
scholar and sinologue, has revised the book and added 
an introduction discussing the history and progress of 
the porcelain industry in China from the earliest times 
to the present, with a full accoimt of the marks and seals. 
The pubUc is thus afforded an opportunity to study the 
most comprehensive collection of its kind in the world 
in the Ught of the latest research. The body of the 
catalogue, originally prepared by Mr. William M. Laffan, 
is clear, succinct, and as far as possible non-technical. 
It is fully and beautifully illustrated. 

" Sheffield Plate " is the subject of the new volume 
in the Newnes " Library of the Applied Arts," which 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons issue in America. The 
author, Mr. Bertie Wyllie, treats his subject thoroughly. 



and yet manages to avoid technicaUties and burdensome 
detaU. Over a hundred and twenty excellent illustra- 
tions, many of them made from articles in fine private 
collections, add materially to the value and interest of 
the text. Mr. Wyllie explains how Sheffield Plate was 
discovered, how it was made, and in what its imique 
value consists. He warns collectors against the fraud- 
ulent practices of unscrupulous dealers, furnishes lists 
of the marks used by the makers of old Sheffield, and 
gives full accounts of the periods and the designs most 
prized by connoisseurs. An enthusiastic collector him- 
self, he avoids the dry, statistical tone that discourages 
the beginner, and he possesses a happy faculty — some- 
what rare in students of the antique — of saying clearly 
and exactly what he means. 

An accoimt of the career of an old-time Boston 
merchant-philanthropist, not one of the aristocratic- 
conservative type, but a man of democratic spirit, an 
aboUtionist, a friend and supporter of John Brown, is 
given in " The Life and Public Services of George Luther 
Steams" (Lippincott), by his son, Frank Preston Stearns. 
The personahty of the subject is interesting, and there 
are in the book glimpses of notable public men, — 
Sumner, Stanton, Governor Andrew, and others. But 
the main value of the work lies in its presentation of two 
leading interests in the life of Mr. Stearns, — his sup- 
port of John Brown throughout his Kansas career, which 
was constant and mvaluable to the carrying out of the 
New England plans, and his services in recruiting negroes 
for the Union armies. The account of these activities 
is full and of permanent value. The tone of the book 
is belligerent where differences of opinion and method 
are discussed, and many violent prejudices make them- 
selves manifest. These features detract from the reader's 
pleasure, but they are themselves, as it were, foot-notes 
to the history of the time. 



Notes. 



The Macmillan Co. are the pubhshers of a new edition 
of " Silas Marner," charmingly illustrated in color by 
Mr. Hugh Thomson. 

A small book of " Laboratory Exercises in General 
Zoology," by Professor Glenn W. Herrick, has just been 
published by the American Book Co.

sive pocket edition by Mr. Henry Frowde.

The Cambridge University edition of Beaumont and

The next important addition to the " English Men of

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



Clarke Sellery; and "The Indebtedness of Samuel 
Taylor Coleridge to August Wilhelm von Schlegel," 
by Miss Anna Augusta Helmholtz. 

A third edition of the " Practical Physiology of 
Plants," by Francis Darwin and E. Hamilton Acton, is 
published by the Messrs. Macmillan at the Cambridge 
University Press. 

Volume II. of Dr. Augustus H. Strong's " Systematic 
Theology " has just come from the Griffith & Rowland 
Press, Philadelphia, and has for its special subject " The 
Doctrine of Man." 

A volume containing a dozen of Emerson's earUer 
essays, edited for school use by Miss Edna H. L. Turpin, 
is now added to the series of English texts published by 
the Charles E. Merrill Co. 

Sidney's " Apologie for Poetrie,'' edited, with intro- 
duction, memoir, and notes, by Professor J. Churton 
Collins, is a welcome reprint of a noble work, now pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

Volume VI. of "The Jatoka; or, Stories of the 
Buddha's Former Births," as translated from the PaH 
by the late Professor Cowell and Mr. W. H. D. Rpuse, 
is now published at the Cambridge University Press 
(Macmillan). 

" The Distribution of Ownership," by Professor 
Joseph Harding Underwood, and " The Legislature of 
the Province of Virginia," by Professor Elmer I. Miller, 
are two monographs recently issued from the Columbia 
University Press. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. now publish, in two parts, "A 
Syllabus for the History of Western Europe," by Pro- 
fessor Norman Maclaren Trenholme, designed for use 
in connection with Professor Robinson's well-known 
text-books of the subject. 

Mr. Henry B. Damon of Katonah, New York, has 
published a booklet of quotations entitled "Grems of 
Thought." The book is hand printed from script letter- 
ing, tastefully bound in heavy paper covers, and enclosed 
in an artistic wrapper, ready for mailing. 

Messrs. Duffield & Co. will publish next month a 
posthumous work of the late Richard Hovey, entitled 
" To the End of the Trail." This collection of poems 
will form a companion volume to " Along the Trail," 
of which a new edition was recently issued. 

" A Pocket-Book of the Early American Humorists," 
in two small volumes, is published by Messrs. Small, 
Maynard & Co. The range is from Franklm to Holmes, 
and the old-timers — Mrs. Partington, Orpheus C. Kerr, 
Artemus Ward, Josh Billings, and Petroleum V. Nasby 
— are all liberally represented. 

Messrs. P. Blakiston's Sons & Co. are the publishers 
of an important work by Professor William Chase 
Stevens, entitled " Plant Anatomy from the Standpoint 
of the Development and Fmictions of the Tissues and 
Handbook of Micro-Technic." The work has many 
illustrations from original drawings. 

The Uterary legacy of the late George Henry Miles is 
now made complete by the republication of " Christine," 
his early volume of poems. Like the posthumous vol- 
tmie of poems, recently reviewed by us, and the sug- 
gestive study of Hamlet, this volume bears the imprint 
of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" The Lakeside Classics," published for private dis- 
tribution as examples of tasteful and inexpensive book- 
making by the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., Chicago, 
are to include a group of volimies of « Memorable Amer- 
ican Speeches," selected by Mr. John Vance Cheney. 



The first of these volumes is now sent us, containing 
speeches from the colonial period of our history, and 
representing ten public men. The editor has provided 
the book with historical notes, and it is deserving of a 
less limited form of publication. 

" Select Poems of Alfred Tennyson," edited by Pro- 
fessor Archibald MacMechan, is the latest accession to 
the "Belles Lettres" series of Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
From the same publishers we have a " Handbook of 
Composition," by Dr. Edwin C. WooUey, which is a very 
practical connpendium of the rules that every writer 
should know. 

A new edition of Dr. John Kells Ingram's " History 
of Political Economy " is published by the Macmillan 
Co. The preface for American readers is written by 
Dr. E. J. James, and, singularly enough, is dated from 
the University of Pennsylvania, an institution with which 
the editor has had no connection for more than ten years. 
This means, of course, that the new edition is a reprint 
only. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. annoimce for early 
spring publication, a new book of essays by John 
Burroughs entitled " Leaf and Tendril " ; a volume by 
Professor Irving Babbitt, of the Harvard Faculty, on 
" Literatm-e and the American College " ; and a collec- 
tion of New England salt-water tales, entitled "The 
Rose," by George S. Wasson, author of " The Green 
Shay," " Cap'n Simeon's Store," etc.

TO APPEAR FEBRUARY 8 

A New Novel by WILLIAM De MORGAN, Author of ALIGE-FOR-SHORT 

SOMEHOW GOOD 

After years of separation from his wife, the hero, during a complete suspension of memory and loss of 
identity, accidentally finds shelter in her home. This situation seems very simple, but the developments are 
far from simple, and form a story of complicated motives and experiences which holds the reader closely. 

An almost grown-up daughter, ignorant of the situation, heightens the tension of the plot, and furnishes 
her share of two charming stories of young love. 

That this third volume by Mr. De Morgan appears within less than a year and a half of his first, may 
arouse anxiety on the part of his admirers lest he be overproducing. But before he published his first novel, 
he had several completely written, and several others carefully sketched out. So far from " Somehow Good " 
being diluted work, it is, in the unanimous opinion of the publishers' readers, an advance upon anything of 
Mr. De Morgan's yet published. (12mo, 565 pp., $1.75.)

THE APPRECIA TIONOF LITERATURE. 

A great deal of printed matter, intended for 
the admonition and guidance of young people, is 
put forth every year upon the subject of books 
and reading. Sometimes it takes the futile 
form of an annotated list or course of study ; 
sometimes it consists of mere rhetorical vaporing ; 
occasionally it combines instruction with counsel 
in a really helpful and inspiring way. But this 
aim is not to be reached (either by pretentious 
twaddle or by rigorous prescription, for the 
former is rarely imposing and the latter is rarely 
practical. The fundamental difficulty of the 
problem is to be met only by a clear recognition 
of the fact that literary appreciation is an indi- 
vidual concern, and that, while standards of 
taste undoubtedly exist and their acquisition 
should be the ultimate goal of every reader, they 
are attained to by many paths, and it would be 
a wise man indeed who should know how to mark 
out the course best fitted for another's steps. 

The best of all agencies for the inculcation of 
a sound literary taste is the home library, well 
stocked with books new and old (especially old), 
accessible to the child from the days of his early 
toddlings, and offering him its unaffected wel- 
come. But the old-fashioned home library, in 
the sense in which we read of it in the literature 
of memoir and autobiography, hardly exists 
to-day ; and even in families where it is found, 
the tranquil delights which it offers to the young 
people of the household are forced into too sharp 
a competition with the exciting allurements of 
the outside world. These distractions, for the 
most part trivial if not imwholesome, enlist the 
energies that might easily have been turned into 
bookish channels, and the precious years of 
childhood — the only years in which the best 
foundations of the intellectual life may be laid — 
are frittered away in external frivolities, sacri- 
ficed to the mischievous sentiment which permits 
children to run wild because they enjoy it, and 
because their parents like to see them happy. 

The influence of the home library failing us, 
we must look to the agencies of the public library 
and the school to unfold for our young people 
the joys of reading, which are also much more 
than present joys, since they have the lasting 
effect of enlarging the contacted life of the 



92 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



individual until it coincides with the sphere of 
all human experience. Of these two agencies, 
we are bound to say that the public library has 
risen more completely than the school to the true 
conception of their common task. The reason 
is simple enough. The library, with its enlight- 
ened modern methods and the realization of its 
educational function, treats the young reader as 
an individual ; the school, shackled by system, 
treats him as a member of a regiment. And 
this makes aU the difference between measur- 
able success and certain failure. Prescribed 
books and courses and methods have their uses 
in some departments of educational activity, but 
their effect is absolutely pernicious when they 
are applied to literature as a school subject. And 
yet this obvious truth seems to make no impres- 
sion upon the type of mind that somehow con- 
trives to exercise educational authority in our 
schools, and the sort of teaching that makes 
literature hateful to young minds remains the 
only sort to receive the sanction of our peda- 
gogical pundits. 

If only such a book as that recently pub- 
lished by Professor Woodberry on " The Appre- 
ciation of Literature " were taken to heart by 
the framers of our educational programmes, 
there would quickly be an end of all teaching 
of the subject according to schedule, with marks 
and examinations as final causes. The author 
says : 

" Without setting limits to study of whatever sort, 
for all modes of study have possible uses, it is to be laid 
down in general that all study of literature in the way 
of preparation to grasp and understand, whether it be 
linguistic, historical, or aesthetic, exists to be forgotten 
and laid off as soon as it is completed; its end is to with- 
draw one by one the veils, and leave the reader alone 
with the spirit of the book, which then speaks to him 
face to face." 

This is absolutely true ; and yet, in spite of it, 
our teachers continue to treat the scaffolding 
as if it were the building itself, and offer to eager 
young minds the sawdust of information as if it 
were the food for which the spirit craves. 

The most contracted of minds may undoubt- 
edly be enlarged by the mere process of accre- 
tion, but this is not organic growth. Rather 
does it stifle growth by encasing the developing 
faculties within a hard shell of fact, excluding 
the light and air they most need. If we are to 
strengthen the feeling for literature in the imma- 
ture mind, we must first of all realize that study 
is only subsidiary to our purpose, that our real 
aim is to take the individual mind as we find it, 
selecting our means with reference to the par- 
ticular stage of development it may have reached, 



appealing to such sympathies and imaginative 
resources as it already exhibits, and at the same 
time slightly anticipating the emergence of 
powers now latent, but on the point of becoming 
active. For, as our author further says, every 
reader, young or old, " is at last thrown fairly 
back upon his own experience, or the kind and 
quality of the life he has lived, for his apprecia- 
tion of literature. ... If the light is not in him, 
he cannot see." 

The fundamental lesson of all this is that, in 
dealing with the child, we must keep pretty close 
to the child's level. 

" The natural introduction to literature for the very 
young is by means of that universal sort which is 
selected from all ages and requires no study, such as the 
stories of Scripture, short legendary tales of history, 
beast and bird fables, fairy tales and the like. They 
have, besides their intelligibility, the advantage of 
accustoming the mind to a make-believe world, natural 
to childish fancy, and so laying the foundation for that 
principle of convention which is fundamental in art and 
indispensable in its practice, and also of making the 
contemplation of imaginary experience habitual so that 
there is no shock between it and truth." 

Even " nature-faking " gets a good word from 
Professor Woodberry. 

" The transposition by which human experience is 
placed in the bird and beast world is a literary fiction; as 
an element in early education it helps to give that plas- 
ticity to the world of fact which is essential to the artistic 
interpretation of life and the imaginary habit of mind." 

If a few of these ideas were once fairly lodged 
in the pedagogical cranium, we should witness 
an amazing reform in educational methods, and 
we might save for other objects the sympathies 
we now have to lavish upon hapless boys and 
girls engaged in studying (in the name of liter- 
ature!) such productions as Addison's Essays, 
and Burke on Conciliation, and Defoe on the 
London Plague. 

We have taken these illustrative texts from 
Professor Woodberry's opening chapter on 
" First Principles." We might find others no 
less suggestive in the succeeding chapters, which 
discuss the appreciation of the several literary 
species — of lyrical, narrative, and domestic 
poetry, of the novel, the history, and the essay. 
The whole treatment is so admirable and so vital, 
so closely in touch with the essentials of the sub- 
ject, that we wish for it the widest possible in- 
fluence. And it would be difiicult to sum up 
the entire matter with more truth and effective 
eloquence than we find in the closing sentences 
of the book. 

"Study has great deadening power over life; and 
when the reader finds this deadening influence in his 
pursuit of literature, when personahty begins to fade 
from the page, and the abstract, the parasitical, the fact

encroach, and literature becomes rather a form of know- 
ledge than of life, then he is losing the proper good of 
literature; and he should seek again in himself and his 
authors the vitality of a personal touch, the connection 
of life, the power of human truth. The great thing is 
to remain alive in one's reading, and nowhere should the 
principle of life be more sacredly guarded than in its 
most immortal presence — imaginative literature and 
those other forms that take their color from its himian 
methods." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



PROOF-8HEET MARGINALIA offer, as a rule, even less 
of literary attraction than does the dictionary ; but some 
of De Quincey's corrections of proof (and of printer) 
have a certain vituperative emphasis and vigor that 
make them lively reading. A few of his vehement and 
pithy remarks, culled from his proof-sheets, have lately 
found their way into print and are worth passing along. 
The little opium-eater was emphatically of the genus 
irritabile, put into a passion by a misspelt word or a mis- 
placed comma, and making life miserable for his printers. 
The word " aerial " set up with initial diphthong called 
forth the following objurgatory apostrophe : " Oh, thou 
unknown compositor, dost thou mean to drive me to an 
early grave, dost thou not know that aerial was a word 
of four syllables in the times of the Greeks and the 
Romans, was then, is now, and ever shall be, world with- 
out end. Amen ! " In another instance, correcting the 
omission of a letter, the incensed author told the com- 
positor, in language far from polite, that the missing 
letter was a necessary part of the word, and would 
remain so " when you are damned, or hanged for for- 
gery." Proof-correctors are of many and unaccount- 
able kinds. Leslie Stephen groaned over the frequent 
and outrageous misprints in his books, but declared him- 
self unable to hold his mind down to the proof-reader's 
level. Evidently he should have employed a less lofty- 
minded person to act for him. Walter Pater, on the 
other hand, who certainly lived on no low plane, was 
never weary of correcting and re-correcting his proof- 
sheets; in fact, he used to order a preliminary printing, 
at his own expense, solely for the purpose of seeing what 
corrections the types suggested that the manuscript did 
not. A somewhat similar passion on Balzac's part is 
known to aU. , , , 

The poet's beatific vision can induce oblivion of 
pelting rain, clinging mud, deafening roar of city streets, 
and all the nerve-racking accompaniments of urban 
existence. Witness this remembrance of the late Francis 
Thompson (already regretfully mentioned by us as one 
whose early promise had inspired hopes of memorable 
achievement still to come) from the pen of Mr. C. Lewis 
Hind : " The roads were ankle-deep in slush ; a thin, icy 
rain was falling; the yellow fog enwrapped the pedes- 
trians squelching down the lane; and, going through 
them in an arrow-path, I saw Francis Thompson, wet 
and mud-spattered. But he was not unhappy. What 
is a day of unpleasant weather to one who lives in 
eternity ? His lips were moving, his head was raised, 
his eyes were himiid with emotion; for above the roof 
of the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Company, in the 
murk of the fog, he saw beatific visions." But we are 
all human, and one touch of nature makes the whole 
world kin; therefore we must proceed a little further 



with these reminiscences. Thompson had reviewed 
Henley's " Collected Poems," and Henley had asked 
Mr. Hind to bring the younger poet to see him. " That 
was a memorable afternoon, but it did not begin auspi- 
ciously. Thompson was an hour late in calling for me 
at the office; when we reached Muswell Hill railway 
station he complained of himger, ate a vast quantity of 
cold beef, aud then alarmed me by gliding into a trance. 
Suddenly he became rigid, his body swayed, and a film 
came over his eyes. It seemed as if his soul had flitted 
temporarily from his body." Instead of a trance, was 
it not rather an attack of acute indigestion, or stomach- 
ache, after all that cold beef ? But whatever the seizure, 
it passed off, and the two poets held high converse 
together. , . , 

The claims of Greek literature will not be 
silenced by any Harrovian head-master's pronounce- 
ment, such as that recently uttered. Educational 
waste may be, and ought to be, diminished by ceasing 
to impose the reading of ^schylus on a youth who can- 
not even make anything out of Shakespeare. Individ- 
ual aptitudes are receiving, in these days of rapidly 
multiplying "electives," more careful attention; but 
that the human mind is ever likely to undergo such a 
change as to render it incapable of reaping profit from 
the study of the Greek and Latin languages and litera- 
tures, is almost imthinkable. So long as man has a wit 
to be sharpened, an intelligence to be broadened, a 
power of self-utterance to be developed, the most per- 
fect medium of literary expression, as displayed in the 
masterpieces of Greek history and philosophy, drama 
and oratory, should be to him an educational instrument 
and an intellectual solace. That the ancient classics 
should ever again dominate the school curriculum, as 
they once did, is not to be expected any more than that 
this modern life of multifarious interests and activities 
should yield to a return of mediaeval narrowness of 
outlook and slowness of movement. It is unnatural for 
the present-day American to regard facility in speaking 
and writing Latin as the one indispensable mark of a 
gentleman and scholar, just as it is unnatural for the 
twentieth-century Dutchman to look upon tulip-culture 
as the most important and most delightful of human 
occupations. ... 

An "authoritative" life of Henry Irving, 
following with due deliberation after the two somewhat 
precipitate biographies by Mr. Bram Stoker and Mr. 
Percy Fitzgerald, is promised by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. The satisfactory and final account of 
Irving and his art this journal has already declared to 
be among the books still to be desired, and it gives us 
pleasure to quote the publisher's announcement : " We 
beg to inform you that the authoritative Life of Henry 
Irving is in preparation, and will be published by us next 
autumn. The biography is being written by Mr. Austin 
Brereton, an old and intimate personal friend of the 
great actor, who was supplied with much valuable and 
unique material for the work by Sir Henry Irving him- 
self. Sir Henry's sons, Mr. H. B. Irving and Mr. 
Laurence Irving, who are the executors under their 
father's will, have given their cordial consent to Mr. 
Brereton's undertaking, and have supplied him for the 
purpose of this book with all the records and other 
documents relating to their father which they possess. 
As this will be the authorized biography of Henry 
Irving, it is desirous that it should be as comprehensive 
as possible, and all owners of letters of public interest

Uniformity in catalogue cards and catalogu- 
ing CODES is being rapidly effected by the increasing use 
of the cards printed and sold by the Library of Congress. 
In the past year 952 subscribers, chiefly public libraries, 
were supplied — an increase of 188 over the preceding 
year. The whole amount paid by these 952 institutions 
for cards purchased during the twelve months was 
$19,222; and as the saving effected through the use of 
these cards is estimated at from four to seven times 
their cost, the cataloguing bureau at Washington would 
appear to set free from $76,000 to $134,000 annually 
for the purchase of library books and the supplying of 
other important library needs. The total number of 
titles now covered by these cards is 280,000, of which 
55,000 represent the past year's additions. It is pleas- 
ant to think how much pen-scratching, or type-writer 
thumping, is saved to these 952 libraries throughout 
the land. How many cases of writer's cramp may have 
been thus prevented, and how much human energy and 
intelligence released for less grinding and macliine-like 
toil than this dreary and never-ending manufacture of 
author-cards, title-cards, subject-cards, cross-reference- 
cards, and so on, through all the subordinate varieties! 
In a mild degree, it is as if the problem of pain had 
been rendered a little less heart-breaking by the substi- 
tution (let us say) of one central toothache for fifty 
thousand separate and independent toothaches.

A prize competition of poets is " on " in England. 
A great tobacco-house, recognizing that music hath 
charms to soothe the smoker's breast, has offered a prize 
for the best lay that shall sing the praises of the firm's 
nicotine products. And such a prize ! " A freehold 
furnished coimtry house, with pony and trap, stabling, 
bath, electric light, and £2 per week pension for life." 
Who would not be a rhymester, with such a reward of 
merit before his eyes ! Edward FitzGerald used to aver 
that everyone could, once at least in a lifetime, turn out 
a copy of "occasional" verses; and surely here is an 
occasion well worth rising to — worth £104 per annum, 
and house and stable, bath and pony and electric light, 
besides. But to compete with any chance of success one 
ought, in the poetic fitness of things, to be an impas- 
sioned smoker and write imder the immediate influence 
of the great tobacco firm's choicest brand of Havana 
cigars; and as not all of lis are smokers (far less chewers 
or snuff-takers) we cannot, alas, all hope to win the 
" two pound per " and accompanying etceteras. But we 
couldn't all hope to win, anyway; so there is still con- 
solation for our disappointment.

A quaintly interesting annual, but of a very 
different quaintness from that of our grandparents' 
annuals — those prim posy-beds of sentimental poetry 
•that used to grace the marble-topped drawing-room 
table — makes its new year's appearance from historic 
old Marblehead, in Massachusetts. Like the blessings 
of fresh air and pure water and genial sunshine, it 
is dispensed without money and without price. The 
Marblehead business man who issues this welcome 
annual — it is, in plain words, a seed catalogue — will 



never be tempted to burn his books, because he has no 
books to burn, so far as may be judged from his frank 
account of his business methods. These methods have 
built up a large and prosperous trade, which now in his 
eightieth year the head of the house hands over to the 
care of his son, " who has served an apprenticeship 
of half a century to the calling." Assured that the 
younger man will continue the older's poUcy of dealing 
with others as he would have them deal with him, 
the father thus concludes his preface to his patrons: 
" Should mankind, as individuals or nations, but accept 
this as a rule of life, we should need no Hague confer- 
ences, and State prisons might be turned into brick 
quarries. In these days, when so many of our fellow- 
men in other callings are overweighed with heavy busi- 
ness responsibilities, my brother farmers, we make up 
that fortunate class which, affiliating with neither 
poverty nor riches, can enjoy a freedom controlled by 
no man, and the wholesome pleasure which crowns the 
Simple Life." Verily, there are tongues in trees, books 
in the running brooks, and sermons in seed catalogues.

The transplanting of words, and their frequent 
vigorous growth in the new soU long after the parent 
stock has withered away, is a subject of unfailing interest 
to dabblers in philology. One who is not a dabbler, 
however, Colonel T. W. Higginson, contributes to a 
current newspaper some interesting observations on 
"The Migration of Words," and incidentally shows 
what a surprising amount of supposed American slang 
is to be found in the " Diary and Letters " of Madame 
d' Arblay (Frances Burney), the admired author of 
" Evelina " and " Cecilia." In the memoirs above 
named — published in 1842, twelve years earlier than 
the date given by Mr. Higginson — appear such modern 
terms and phrases as " cute," " hang it," " downed," 
" trembled a few," " snigger," " a most elegant dessert," 
" a high treat," and many others. In Francis Grose's 
" Provincial Glossary" (1814) occur still more numerous 
and surprising " Americanisms." Colonel Higginson 
recalls the quaint dialect of old Marblehead, and says 
that there only on our coast could be heard the uncouth 
word " gawming " (awkward, lubberly) which Grose's 
dictionary contams as a North-of-England term. From 
it, we conjecture, may have come the form " gawmed " 
(or " gormed "), heard in rural speech; as "yougormed 
idiot! " This migration of words is ever in progress, 
and will always furnish a pleasant subject of study to 
the philologically curious.

A HANDBOOK TO THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS OF THE 

United States is a work the need for which has long 
been recognized, but which no one has hitherto had the 
courage to undertake. Now we are told that the 
manuscript of this exceptionally useful, and indeed 
indispensable, library tool has been completed. The 
compiler is Miss Elfrida Everhart, Reference Librarian 
of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta, and instructor in 
the Southern Library School. One who has had an 
opportunity of reading the manuscript describes Miss 
Everhart's work as admirably clear, concise, well- 
arranged, and, above all, accurate. It is expected that 
the Handbook will appear some time in the spring, 
probably through one of the New York publishers. It 
will undoubtedly be a boon to everyone who has occa- 
sion to consult the public documents of the United 
States, and who therefore appreciates the need of a 
trustworthy key to that labyrinthine mystery.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE OLD-FASHIONED LIBRARIAN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The complaint voiced by Mr. Thomas H. Briggs in 
the last nimiber of The Dial, that it is not possible to 
get librarians who love books and their contents, is one 
that has been frequentlj' made of late, and it must be 
admitted, even by librarians themselves, that it is not 
wdthont some foundation in fact. It is true that many, 
perhaps most, of the men and women employed in libra- 
ries are not book-lovers in the old-fashioned way which 
Mr. Briggs thinks desirable. Far too many, even of 
those who are at the head of libraries, have not a real 
love of books, and their knowledge of them is sometimes 
not much more than that gained in an ordinary college 
education. It mvist even be confessed that the graduates 
of library schools do not always have that wide and va- 
ried knowledge of the contents of books that the public 
(and library trustees) are justified in desiring, if not in 
demanding. 

Having admitted this, if your space permits, I wish 
to pouit out one or two facts that account for the con- 
dition in which Mr. Briggs finds himself. In passing, 
however, one might question whether the old-fashioned 
book-loving librarian was as efficient as a few critics of 
present-day librarians would like us to believe. Tradi- 
tion tells us that his love of books was so great that he 
wanted all the books to stay in the library all the time. 
A worn-out book was an unfamiliar object to his eyes. 
Both his lack of system and iron-clad rules tended to pre- 
vent those who would really be most benefitted by books 
from ever obtainuig them. The motto of the American 
Library Association, " The best reading for the largest 
number at the least cost," would not have appealed to 
him. He was a book-lover, but he was not a lover of 
humanity. The public had to seek him ; he never sought 
the public. Whatever the faults of the modern librarian 
may be, it must be admitted that he has plenty of mis- 
sionary spirit which leads him to go out into the high- 
ways and byways, and to try to make the library an 
influence for good in the life of his community. And 
this missionary spirit will be foimd most firmly im- 
planted in those who have graduated from library 
schools. For I firmly believe, that, in addition to the 
technical training which students receive, they also be- 
come thoroughly imbued with the idea that the public 
library is an educational force in the community, and 
that it is their duty to augment its efficiency and to 
bring an ever-increasing number of persons within the 
circle of its influence. 

The principal reason, I believe, for Mr. Briggs's 
failure to find book-loving librarians is that there is not 
a sufficient number of real book-lovers such as he wants, 
to supply even approximately the demand for library 
workers. As a librarian myself, I am thrown in contact 
more or less with many kinds of users of the library. 
There are professional men who use the library in their 
work. There are the club women who prepare essays 
and do prescribed reading. There are the workingmen 
who use the technical books to increase their knowledge 
of their trade. There are the teachers, and there are 
the coimtless thousands of novel readers. Among all 
those who use the library more or less constantly, I 
have found in the last three years not over five who 
would fulfill Mr. Briggs's ideal (and mine). Not over 
five have revealed in any way whatsoever that they use 



the library other than for reference or purely recreation- 
ary purposes. This experience, and the experience of 
the years before I was at the head of a library, or even 
before I was interested in library work at all, lead me to 
believe that the real book-lover is an exceedingly scarce 
person. If all the real book-lovers were engaged in 
library work, there would still be room for many others, 
and Mr. Briggs, as well as other library trustees, would 
have to employ many who have little more than a library 
school training and a missionary spirit to recommend 
them. Arthxjr L. Bailey.

LIBRARY CIRCULATION IN ENGLAND AND 

AMERICA. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I have just seen a paragraph in your January issue, 
regarding the Public Libraries of this coxmtry, based 
upon some figures taken from my " Manual of Library 
Economy." There is one mistake which I think ought 
to be corrected, and that is the statement that "the 
average number of books drawn annually by each bor- 
rower is 3 " This quotation refers to the number of 
volumes stocked per borrower : the number of books 
read annually is 30 per borrower. I may state that a 
more recent investigation shows that in the Municipal 
Libraries of the United Kingdom no fewer than 
60,000,000 volumes are annually circulated for home 
reading, and that over 11,000,000 books are issued for 
reference use, without counting the enormous number 
of consultations at the open shelves of such Libraries. 

There is just one important point which, to a very 
great extent, I think, must be held to qualify any com- 
parisons which are made between the Library work of 
the United States and the United Kingdom. It must 
always be remembered that British Public Libraries 
labour under the serious disadvantage of a Rate limita- 
tion, which brings the average income for all purposes 
down to about one-third of the average income enjoyed 
by American Libraries. For example, the Boston Public 
Library has an income of £68,000, against £26,410 
which Manchester expends for all purposes. The 
annual circulation from Boston is 1,461,000 volumes 
issued from the Central Library, 10 branches, 23 deliv- 
ery stations, etc., while at Manchester the annual cir- 
culation is 1,957,475 volumes issued from 19 branches 
and delivery stations. 

I think there is no doubt that the Library systems 
of both countries, imder varying conditions, are doing 
splendid work, and that the Public Library in any town 
would be one of the last of the municipal services which 
the inhabitants would care to see aboUshed.

PRINCIPAL CAIRD OF GLASGOW— A CORRECTION. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In The Dial of February 1, on page 80, you speak 
of Dr. Edward Caird " succeeding Jowett as Master of 
Balliol, but perhaps better remembered as Principal 
Caird of Glasgow University." This appears to be a 
slight mistake on your part, as the Principal of Glasgow 
University was John Caird, the famous Scotch preacher 
who published by command of the Queen his great ser- 
mon on "The Religion of Common Life." If I am 
correct, he was the brother of Dr. Edward Caird.

The True Story op a Strange 
Boyhood.* 



It was unnecessary for the author of " Father 
and Son " to assure the reader in his preface 
that his narrative was not fiction in disguise, 
but a true history faithfully recorded. Its 
reality speaks in every line of the simple, 
restrained, unrhetorical setting forth of the 
anonymous writer's rigorous upbringing under 
the severe rule of a religiously and morally strict 
father and mother, the sole object of whose 
parental care it was his lot to be. The rigors 
of John Stuart Mill's training at the hands of 
his father almost take on a sybaritic softness 
when compared with the austerities of the 
Calvinistic household in which the boyhood of 
this other paternally educated child was passed. 

As the author himself says, the peculiar value 
of the book is in its being " a record of educa- 
tional and religious conditions which, having 
passed away, will never return." It is " the 
diagnosis of a 'dying Puritanism," and as such 
it will gain in curious interest, especially to the 
student of religious history, as time passes. 
Let it not, however, be thought that a warmer 
human interest is lacking to the story. Even 
spiritual struggles have their humorous aspects, 
and there is laughter as well as weeping in this 
eminently human narrative. Its appeal is made 
all the stronger by the easy identification of 
its two leading characters, father and son, as a 
once well-known naturalist of the anti-Darwinian 
school, and a prominent author of our own time, 
respectively. Or, to be more specific, the father 
is Philip Henry Gosse, best remembered for his 
" Romance of Natural History," though he wrote 
many other popular text-books of a similar sort ; 
and the son, of course, is Mr. Edmund Gosse, 
who needs no further introduction. Any possible 
doubter may easily convince himself by turning 
to Mr. Gosse's brief account of his father in the 
" Dictionary of National Biography " and com- 
paring that record with the book. The latter 
shows no attempt at concealment except in cer- 
tain very natural suppressions or alterations of 
personal names. 

No outline of the book can do it justice, but 
a few selected passages may quicken the reader's 
interest and inspire him with a desire to possess 
himself of the story in full. The peculiar re- 
ligious beliefs of the father and mother were

those of the so-caUed " Plymouth Brethren." 
Each parent " was prominent before the eyes 
of a public of his or her own, half a century 
ago," and it is largely because "their minds 
were vigorous and their accomplishments dis- 
tinguished that the contrast between their 
spiritual point of view and the aspect of a 
similar class of persons to-day is interesting," 
and, the author hopes, instructive. The mother, 
it should be noted, was intellectually gifted to 
such an extent that she became a fair Greek 
and a still better Hebrew scholar, besides writ- 
ing and publishing devotional poems that met 
with considerable acceptance. The father's 
talents as a naturalist, his power of close 
scrutiny and accurate observation, won for him 
from Huxley the doubtful compliment of being 
called the " honest hodman of science." Both 
father and mother were zealous workers in the 
church, indefatigable seekers after lost souls, 
and insistent that their son should be equally 
active, in season and out of season, in the woric 
of testimony and conversion. But let the author 
speak for himself. 

"The peculiarities of a family life, founded upon 
such principles, are, in relation to a little child, obvious ; 
but I may be permitted to recapitulate them. Here was 
perfect purity, perfect intrepidity, perfect abnegation; 
yet there was also narrowness, isolation, an absence of 
perspective, let it be boldly admitted, an absence of 
humanity. And there was a curious mixture of humble- 
ness and arrogance; entire resignation to the will of God 
and not less entire disdain of the judgment and opinion 
of man. My parents founded every action, every atti- 
tude, upon their interpretation of the Scriptures, and 
upon the guidance of the Divine Will as revealed to 
them by direct answer to prayer. Their ejaculation in 
the face of any dilemma was, ' Let us cast it before the 
Lord!'" 

But it was this very habit of carrying every- 
thing to the Lord in prayer that first occa- 
sioned, in the son's restlessly inquiring mind, a 
doubt of the parental infallibility. Just how 
this first germ of skepticism was planted and 
nourished is vividly and humorously told in the 
book. 

" The question of the efficacy of prayer, which has puz- 
zled wiser heads than mine, began to trouble me. It was 
insisted on in our household that if anything was de- 
sired, you should not, as my Mother said, ' lose any time 
in seeking for it, but ask God to guide you to it.' In 
many junctures of life, this is precisely what, in sober 
fact, they did. I will not dwell here on their theories, 
which my mother put forth, with imflinching directness, 
in her published writings. But I found that a difference 
was made between my privileges in this matter and 
theirs, and this led me to many discussions. My parents 
said : ' Whatever you need, tell Him and He will grant 
it, if it is His will.' Very well; I had need of a large 
painted humming-top which i had seen in a shop- window 
in the Caledonian Road. Accordingly, I introduced a

supplication for this object into my evening prayer, care- 
fully adding the words: 'If it is Thy will.' This, I 
recollect, placed my Mother in a dilemma, and she con- 
sulted my Father. Taken, I suppose, at a disadvantage, 
my Father told me I must not pray for ' things like 
that.' To which I answered by another query, 'Why?' 
And I added that he said we ought to pray for things 
we needed, and that I needed the humming-top a great 
deal more than I did the conversion of the heathen or 
the restitution of Jerusalem to the Jews, two objects 
.of my nightly supplication which left me very cold." 

The father was plainly cornered, especially as 
the son had been expressly taught that " no 
things or circumstances are too insignificant to 
bring before the God of the whole earth." In 
the end, therefore, the elder simply refused to 
argue the question, and flatly told the boy it 
was wrong to pray for things like humming- 
tops, and he must do it no more. The fatal 
suspicion was left in the infant mmd that a 
traceable connection existed between this per- 
emptory prohibition, the cost of the coveted toy, 
and the state of the family exchequer. 

A further and more fatal shaking of the 
child's faith in the God of his parents came a 
little later. Having obtained from his father a 
categorical statement that idolatry consisted in 
praying to anyone or anything but God him- 
seK, and also that God would be very angry and 
would show his wrath if anyone in a Christian 
country bowed down to wood or stone, the still 
skeptical child took advantatage of a moment 
when he was alone in the house to put the matter 
to a decisive test. Placing a small chair on a 
table, he knelt before it and repeated his daily 
prayer, only substituting the address " O Chair" 
for the usual one. But the sole result was a 
quickening of the young idolater's heart-beat as 
he waited to be consumed by the wrath of heaven. 
After that the boy had less confidence than ever 
in his father's knowledge of the divine mind. 

Cut off from the world of boyish sports and 
games, from the world of literature and art, and 
from almost everything necessary for a boy's 
healthy development, this lonely child was taught 
to regard himself as marked out for peculiar 
service in the vineyard of the Lord, and as the 
early recipient of extraordinary favors from on 
high. He was among the " saved," and was 
not to associate too intimately with the chil- 
dren of the ungodly. What a marvel that the 
little prig — for such he acknowledges himself to 
have been — ever recovered from so pernicious 
a training ! One's respect for his later achieve- 
ments in the world of letters is greatly heightened 
by this account, almost painfully minute, of his 
starved, strait-laced, self-conscious childhood. 
One unexpected indulgence, however, at his 



father's hands must here be noted. The 
mother's early death and the father's second 
marriage, to Miss Eliza Brightwen, have a 
bearing on the incident. 

" At the age of eleven, I knew a great deal more of 
maps, and of the mutual relation of localities all over 
the globe, than most grown-up people do. ... I was 
now greatly taken with the geography of the West 
Indies, of every part of which I had made MS. maps. 
There was something powerfully attractive to my fancy 
in the great chain of the Antilles, lying on the sea like 
an open bracelet, with its big jewels and little jewels 
strung on an invisible thread. I liked to shut my eyes 
and see it all, in a mental panorama, stretched from Cape 
Sant' Antonio to the Serpent's Mouth. Several of these 
lovely islands, these emeralds and amethysts, set on the 
Caribbean Sea, my Father had known well in his youth, 
and I was importunate in questioning him about them. 
One day as I multiplied inquiries, he rose, as I did so, 
in his impetuous way, and climbing to the top of a book- 
case, brought down a thick volume and presented it to 
me, < You '11 find all about the Antilles there,' he said, 
and left me with * Tom Cringle's Log ' in my possession." 

The story of the youth's growing differences 
with his father in matters of religion, of his 
breaking away from home and insisting on 
living his own life — a course in which he was 
rather aided than opposed by his kind step- 
mother — has a peculiar though a painful inter- 
est that holds one's attention to the end of the 
book. We take leave of the narrator in his 
early manhood, his mind powerfully stirred, and 
providentially stirred, with the conviction that 
" either he must cease to think for himself ; or 
his individualism must be instantly confirmed, 
and the necessity of religious independence must 
be emphasized." No book could better show 
the vast difference between plausible but wholly 
imaginary biography and autobiography (of 
which we have had many graceful specimens 
of late) on the one hand, and the actual record 
of a human soid on the other, than this detailed 
account of the warring of two discordant tem- 
peraments. Percy F. Bicknell. 



Impressions of a Correspoxdent in 

THE KUSSO-JAPANESE WAR.* 

During the late war in the Far East Mr. 
Frederick McCormick, in the capacity of 
Associated Press correspondent, supplied the 
English-speaking world with what usually 
proved to be the most authentic information to 
be had, especially from the Russian side, con- 
cerning the course and character of the struggle. 
After the war was over Mr. McCormick, like 
more than one of his fellow-correspondents, was

moved to bring together his scattered papers, 
revise and enlarge them, and put them before 
the public in more durable form. The two 
stout volumes which have lately come from the 
press, under the somewhat lugubrious title of 
" The Tragedy of Russia in Pacific Asia," com- 
prise the result. It is safe to say that to the 
rapidly growing library of books upon Far 
Eastern subjects they wUl constitute a note- 
worthy, even if not an indispensable, acquisition. 

The value of Mr. McCormick's work arises 
wholly from the intimacy with which the author 
was acquainted with the conditions, the per- 
sonalities, and the events of the war. Mr. 
McCormick is very far from being an historian. 
He does not appeal to one as a profound student 
of contemporary world-politics — if, indeed, it 
is possible for one to be such a student without 
being also a pretty respectable historian. He 
is not even a wholly satisfactory writer of the 
English language ; at least, the happy-go-lucky 
newspaper style above which he seldom rises 
scarcely commends itself in a work of the 
present pretensions. Yet, despite these more 
or less serious limitations, a perusal of his vol- 
umes is sufficient to give the assurance that they 
contain much that is essential to a full knowl- 
edge of the war, and a good deal that one may 
never be able to lay hold of elsewhere. 

Practically aU of the first, and about half of 
the second, volume is taken up with a running 
sketch of the operations of the war from the 
attack on Port Arthur to the capture and de- 
struction of the Russian mobile navy. Extended 
comment upon this portion of the work is per- 
haps hardly necessary. In a succession of some 
forty chapters, accompanied by a number of 
useful drawings and photographs, the plans of 
campaigns, descriptions of tactics, battle-scenes, 
and personal episodes follow one another in a 
gossipy but fairly luminous narrative. It is not 
a formal history, but such material as wiU be of 
large service when the time comes for the writ- 
ing of a formal history of this epoch-marking war. 

After covering thus in detail the course of 
the conflict itself, Mr. McCormick turns to an 
estimate of the combatants, and finally to some 
consideration of the effects of the Japanese 
victory upon the Occident, and more particu- 
larly upon the United States. There is vastly 
more upon the Russians than upon the Japanese, 
for the author was with the Russian armies 
throughout, and naturally writes more fuUy, as 
well as more authoritatively, upon them than 
upon their opponents. With respect, then, first 
of aU, to the Russians, we are assured that though 



they have uniformly showed their worst side in 
the Orient, it has come to be conceded by all 
Eastern peoples that the Muscovites are a potent, 
and not necessarily an altogether baleful, force 
in the modern world. The Japanese were among 
the first to awake to the fact. The disheartening 
exigencies of an unsuccessful war were certainly 
calculated to put the Russian character to the 
test. The residts of this test Mr. McCormick 
undertakes, at much length, to describe. It is 
his judgment that, despite occasional outbreaks 
of treachery and cowardice, the virtues of valor 
and humanity were as strongly in evidence in 
the Russian trenches as in the Japanese. Russian 
preparations for war were pitiably inadequate, 
and from first to last the difficulties to be over- 
come were essentially insuperable ; but the fight 
was a brave one, and, on the whole, one of which 
no people need be ashamed. 

None the less, the impressions of the Russian 
military that one gets from Mr. McCormick's 
narrative are far from roseate. In fact, while 
striving manifestly after impartiality, the author 
finds himself obliged to devote a really startling 
proportion of his space to the faults and weak- 
nesses (not to mention crimes) which he had 
ever before him in the Russian camps. 

" The virtues of the Russian are incomparable, . . . 
but they are insignificant beside his incomparable de- 
fects. The complicated, futile, and useless labor of secret 
agents, intelligence officers, gendarmes, police advisors, 
and censors in the Russian military organization in itself 
represented enough energy to win a battle. The energy 
wasted in flirtations was sufficient to plan a campaign or 
take a city ; while the talent and energy spent in dissi- 
pation and graft, were enough to have won the war twice 
over. The battles of the war show an over-reliance on 
organization, which fed the army well, mobilized it in a 
marvellous maimer, cared for its retreats, but could not 
advance it, nor maneuver it in battle, nor bring it along- 
side victory. ... In Manchuria the Russian military 
presents an undignified and demoralized appearance. 
Among no military, perhaps, were boots and buckles and 
big clothes held in such awe. There was an unnecessary 
number of overtrained militaires, exceedingly sensitive 
of their dignity, and more afraid of their reputations for 
nicety and savoir faire than of defeat. . . . Militarism 
appeared to be their vanity. They lacked one at least 
of the essential elements of warriors — military aggres- 
siveness. Their disposition was to hibernate and grow 
fat. Their disposition was peaceful. For this reason 
Russians felt much aggrieved and warred upon, in- 
humanly assailed, and outrageously insulted." 

That the Russians sadly imderestimated the 
formidable character of their opponents, and 
generally misconceived the whole situation, is 
well enough known to followers of Far Eastern 
affairs. 

" The general conception of the war was that Russia, 
in the form of a peaceful genius, holding a lily in one 
hand and a dove in the other, was sprung upon in the 



1908.]

night by a naked savage, armed with a villainous knife, 
bent upon murder. The figure of this peaceable Russian 
female genius, with a sheathed sword entwined with bay 
and a proclamation of peace and good-will from Nicholas 
in her lap, and on her head a cap bearing the cross of 
Christ, is represented in the illustrated press enthroned 
upon the rock of Port Arthur, gazing innocently upon 
the world, invested by beasts and ogres from the deep, 
and about to be assassinated by a half-naked Japanese 
figure coming out of the sea." 

As the war progressed, however, there was dis- 
illusionment, and " it can be said with justice 
that the conviction that the war was a national 
crime rapidly grew among them, so that toward 
the last the justness of their cause was generally 
denied among themselves." Elsewhere Mr. 
McCorraick, writing of the low ebb reached by 
the discipline among the Russian troops, asserts 
that toward the end at least one-third of the 
army regarded the war as a crime, and were 
disposed to surrender to the enemy. 

Rarely indeed has there been put in print a 
more striking arraignment of the Russian in 
arms. Allowing for more or less exaggeration, 
in these days, of the virtues of the opposing 
Japanese, it is still inconceivable that the out- 
come of the war should have been other than 
what it was. 

In a not altogether convincing, but none the 
less suggestive, chapter on " The Elimination of 
the West and the Position of America," the 
author presents what, from the Occidental 
standpoint, must be adjudged a pessimistic 
picture. He expresses the conviction that as 
a result of the signal triumph of the Japanese 
and the revivification of China the hold of 
European powers — especially of France and 
Germany — upon Far Eastern affairs has been 
greatly relaxed. Even more confidently is it 
declared that there has been a marked falling- 
off in American influence in the Orient. 

" The main political figure in the West in the struggle 
for the integrity of China is that of John Hay, but John 
Hay's work, which in the end was inadequate, is about 
the only asset left to America in the East. The Amer- 
ican people did not know how to turn it to account or to 
back it up, and have receded from the position of respect 
which he achieved for them. Russia, the greatest enemy 
of the principles for which he contended, and of the 
reconstructed East Asia with which America is now 
forced to compromise, regards this with open satisfac- 
tion and anticipates a change of American policy, even 
more satisfactory from being in conformity with the 
principles of her own. . . . America's position in the 
East has been changed. Events have reduced her in 
two years to a position of comparative imimportance in 
Peking. Of all the pro-Japanese ' open-door ' and 
Chinese integrity nations it is America that stands low- 
est there. Traditional friendship, sympathy understood 
and expressed upon every occasion when it could be of 
any value, gifts of charity, moral aid and repeated ser- 



vices to the cause of the < open door ' and the preserva- 
tion of Chinese integrity in particular, have not availed 
against a combination of really mean circmnstances, and 
are little more than a name. Her prestige gained from 
meritorious acts dissolved, and positive misfortune has 
overtaken her through Chinese commercial hostility." 

Mr. McCormick's second volume contains a 
documentary appendix of considerable value ; 
also a very useful chronological table of events 
in the Russian " tragedy " from the Treaty of 
Nerchinsk in 1689 to the ratification of the 
Peace of Portsmouth.

Two Histories of Music* 



In the recent great access of books dealing 
with musical subjects there has been a plentiful 
lack of informational works covering the whole 
field or any large portion of it. " Impressions " 
that do not always impress, opinions that do 
little more than opine, we have had in abund- 
ance ; but the way was still suggestively open 
for any broad and comprehensive survey. In 
England the " History of Music " of Rowbotham 
(1885-7), and that of Rockstro (1886) left 
much to be desired ; and in America, Professor 
Dickinson's scholarly " Study of the History of 
Music" (1905) was necessarily quite concise. It 
is a coincidence that two books by American 
musical scholars should just now have made 
abnost simultaneous appearance, which are of 
enough serious importance to deserve special 
attention. 

The desideratum of a treatise which should 
be a hand-book and guide, which should attain a 
certain degree of encyclopasdic fulness, and yet 
by its precise and systematic arrangement should 
help the student without hindering him — and 
which should achieve these ends within the com- 
pass of a single volume — has been satisfactorily 
met by Professor Waldo Selden Pratt's " His- 
tory of Music." The author's long and fruitful 
labors at Hartford Theological Seminary, sup- 
plemented by lectures at Smith College and 
elsewhere, have been creditable to American 
musical scholarship ; and in the book before us 
he has increased the literature of music by a 
contribution of permanent value. 

One of the first merits of the work to deserve 
commendation is the excellent topical arrange- 
ment in divisions and subdivisions, which makes 
the book immediately useful to the hurried

searcher after facts. The eight great epochs of 
musical history are presented in thirty-seven 
chapters and 234 sections. Important move- 
ments and composers are given the dignity of 
large type ; an ample though not exhaustive 
bibliography is appended to each chapter ; cross- 
references are not forgotten ; and two carefully- 
made indexes complete a hand-apparatus which 
will not disappoint either the student or the 
general reader. This adherence to topical sys- 
tem has made it necessary sometimes to speak 
of the same composer at some length in two or 
more widely separated passages ; as where, for 
example, Liszt and the orchestral style of pian- 
ism are discussed on pp. 539-540, Liszt and the 
Weimar circle on pp. 574-575, and Liszt and 
the symphonic poem on pp. 581-585. 

Another good feature is the imerringtsense 
of proportion which pervades the work. Pro- 
fessor Pratt sees the field steadily and sees it 
whole. He seems constantly to have in mind 
the end from the beginning ; and there is no 
evidence of prejudice expanding a favorite 
theme, or lassitude abridging the concluding 
chapters. An illustration of this is his admir- 
able treatment of Mendelssohn — whose almost 
total elimination from modern orchestral concert- 
programmes is a real misfortune. Professor 
Pratt recognizes the spontaneity and charm of 
his music, its perfection of form, its happy com- 
bination of the classic and the romantic ; but 
justly lays more stress on the signal services 
which he performed by his social and profes- 
sional influence, " to which he added the massive 
and continued power of the several organizations 
and institutions with which he was connected ; 
so that the effectiveness of his ideas was larger 
and more lasting than through his work as an 
individual." This is just and true ; and is in 
wholesome contrast to the disproportionate im- 
portance assigned to Mendelssohn in Grove's 
"Dictionary of Music," where he has 58 pages 
as against 47 for Beethoven, 40 for Schumann, 
and 28 for Wagner. 

Professor Pratt's historical erudition is per- 
haps best seen in his treatment of the early 
periods of this most ancient and most modern of 
the arts. His chapters on "Uncivilized and 
Ancient Music " range over the whole world 
of antiquity, and present in readable schemata 
what is probably the sum of our information on 
an obscure subject. With the sixteenth cen- 
tury — " the meeting-place of mediaeval and 
modem life," the material rapidly multiplies, 
and the author must exert to the utmost his 
powers of comparison and perspective. 



The last of the book's great divisions is called 
" a brief sketch of the later nineteenth century "; 
and here alone, and very wisely. Professor Pratt 
refrains from fulness of treatment or any attempt 
at finality of judgment. Its five sections dis- 
cuss " The Wagnerian Triumph," the various 
national " groups," and " Music in the United 
States." Its up-to-date scope may be seen in 
the fact that Grieg's death is recorded (Sep- 
tember, 1907). To these summaries is appended 
a concluding section, entitled " Some Final 
Words," in which the breadth of vision and 
the well-tempered criticism of the entire work 
are finely condensed. He urges the solidar- 
ity of the art from a historical view-point and 
the organic association of the many aspects of 
music : 

" No just view of music or musicianship can afford 
to disdain or ignore any side of the subject, however 
distant from the standpoint of the observer himself. 
The instrumentalist cannot say to the vocalist, ' I have 
no need of you,' nor the operatic singer to the critic, 
nor the theorist to the maker of instruments, nor the 
genius in composition to the promoter of interest among 
amateurs." 

The numerous illustrations of musical instru- 
ments are extremely interesting ; so much can 
hardly^ be said of the likenesses of composers, 
which are conventional drawings from tradi- 
tional portraits. An unusual feature in a work 
of this kind is the addition of three maps show- 
ing those regions of Europe in which music has 
been chiefly developed. 

In Professor Pratt's notices of native-bom 
American composers occurs the following par- 
agraph : 

" John Knowles Paine (d. 1906), from 1862 teacher 
and from 1896 professor (of music), was not only an 
expert organist, but an abimdant and striking composer, 
with two symphonies, two symphonic poems, chamber 
music, the oratorio St. Peter, incidental music to 
Sophocles' (Edipus Tyrannus, a mass, several choral 
cantatas, and many shorter works." 

This compact statement presents the barest 
outline of a long and useful career. As a com- 
poser, it is probably true that Professor Paine 
made no such impress on his generation as, for 
instance, MacDowell has done ; but as teacher 
and lecturer he has inspired hundreds of men 
who came under his influence at Harvard, many 
of whom have achieved distinction in their 
chosen art. Something of the effect of the 
spoken word must persist in the printed and 
published lectures ; and the volume which has 
now appeared, called " The History of Music to 
the Death of Schubert," will appeal, not unsuc- 
cessfully, to a wider circle than that for which

THE DIAL 



101 



they were originally prepared. It seems that it 
was a cherished wish of Professor Paine to have 
his lectures on the History of Music published ; 
and he had prepared, in type-written form, the 
material covering the period to the death of 
Schubert. Since his death, this part of the 
lectures has been revised and put through the 
press by his colleague. Professor Albert A. 
Howard. 

Though in a sense unfinished, the work is no 
mere torso. It is a dignified, lucid, and sym- 
pathetic account of the great steps in the devel- 
opment of the art, from the earliest music of the 
Greeks and Romans down to 1828, the year of 
Schubert's death. As Professor Paine was con- 
servative in taste, it is probable that his opinion 
of the modern schools would not command the 
general assent which will greet his estimate of 
the great classics. As suitable to the plan of 
the lectures, the treatment of the subject is 
broad, and no attempt is made to register every 
name — major or minor ; consequently consid- 
erable fulness is possible in the consideration 
of the masters, the chapters on Bach, Handel, 
Haydn, Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert 
being symmetrical monographs. 

Professor Howard's task as editor has been 
carried out with discrimination and loving care ; 
and his part in the work is probably a larger 
one than his modesty will allow him to admit. 
He will certainly share in the gratitude with 
which Professor Paine's book will be received 
by his old pupils and the musical public.

The Axatomy of Diffidence.* 



That strange malady known as diffidence or 
shyness or bashfulness is an affair about which 
men seldom talk. Those who are its victims are 
reticent iii this as in all else ; and to the rest of 
the world the thing is either incomprehensible 
or riduculous or both. Except in its mildest 
form, as a passing symptom of adolescence, it 
has received scant attention from psychologists 
or physicians. Yet it has been and is the most 
potent and painful fact in hundreds of lives ; 
and many of the world's finest intellects have 
been molded irresistibly in its influence. 

It has remained for an English writer hitherto 
quite unknc)wn, Mr. W. Compton Leith, to for- 
mulate the Anatomy of Diffidence, as Burton 

•Apologia Diffidentis. By W. Compton Leith. New York : 
John Lane Company. 



did of Melancholy ; and it might almost be said 
that he has done it with equal charm. Indeed 
his book seems, to one reader at least, to sur- 
pass in beauty and distinction of style any other 
prose work of the past few years. Its charm 
is akin to that of Mr. A. C. Benson's earlier 
books, yet Mr. Benson at his best has never 
equalled this. 

An acute sufferer throughout a lifetime from 
the disease of which he writes, the author has 
yielded in later years to that insatiate hunger 
for utterance and self-justification so marked in 
the afflicted of his kind ; and in these pages he 
has set down such data as he could, for possible 
use when the " inevitable German " shall pre- 
pare his "Wissenschaftliche Untersuchung der 
Ursache und Entwicklung der Schiichternheit." 
The result is a human document as striking as 
it is unusual. " As I reflect upon what I have 
written," says the author, " and try to imagine 
it read by some brisk person utterly content 
with life, I can well understand that the whole 
thing would appear to him incredible, too pre- 
posterously strange for belief, a rigmarole of 
sick fancies beyond the power of hellebore." S6 
doubtless it would ; but to those who have known 
the scourge of this affliction, or of another as 
great, the impress of truth and wisdom lies deep 
upon every page. 

Lest any might suppose that the disorder here 
dealt with is a matter no more serious than that 
awkward timidity which most of us have known 
in youth, we subjoin this paragraph: 

" At the outset I would make it clear that for me the 
only shyness that counts, is that which is so deeply 
mgrained as to have outlasted youth. It may, indeed, 
be physically related to that transient bashfulness which 
haunts so many of us in our younger days only to vanish 
at maturity, swift as the belated ghost at cockcrow. 
But unlike this common accident of growth, it is no 
surface-defect, but an inward stain which dyes the very 
fibres of the being. It may, indeed, be somewhat 
bleached and diminished by a timely and skilful treat- 
ment, but is become too much a part of life to be ever 
wholly washed away. And the unhappy step-children 
of nature whose inheritance it is, seldom find a deliverer 
good at need; for as the world draws no distinction 
between their grave affliction and that other remediable 
misery of youth, it will sanction no other treatment 
than banter or mockery, which does but infuse yet more 
deeply the mournful dye. When this fails, it leaves its 
victims to the desolation which according to its judg- 
ment they have wilfully chosen; for the most part 
ignoring their existence, but often chastising them with 
scorpion-stings of disdain. Yet the subjects of this 
scorn, sufferers as I believe from a hereditary tendency 
matured by neglect into disease, deserve a more merci- 
ful usage than this, and their plea for extenuating cir- 
cumstances should not be too impatiently rejected. For 
in them what is to most men a transient ailment has

thrown down permanent roots to draw a nourishment 
from pain : and he who is fortunate enough to be whole 
should think twice before he makes sport of those who 
pine in this distress." 

The malady has its cause, we are told, in "an 
antinomy between the physical and intellectual 
elements of the personality, from an unhappy 
marriage of mind and body, suilering the lower 
of the two partners to ruin the life of the higher 
by the continual friction of a hateful but indis- 
soluble union." It is found more commonly in 
men, and among those classes where the outward 
refinements of life are more or less compulsory. 
It is climatic also, having its haunts chiefly in 
the north and west of Europe, — as no less an 
authority than M. Taine has previously borne 
witness. And as it is climatic and geographic, 
so are its birth and growth conditioned by his- 
toric causes. " Just as it is the peculiar failing 
of northern and western peoples, so it is the 
creation of comparatively modern times ; it had 
no place among the classified weaknesses of men 
until these peoples began in their turn to make 
history." 

But, valuable as these facts and theories may 
prove to the " inevitable German " above re- 
ferred to, it is in the author's record of his own 
inner life that the real charm and interest of 
the book lie, — the pages wherein 

" His store of sad experience he 
Lays bare of wretched days; 
Tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs, 
And how the dying spark of hope was fed, 
And how the breast was soothed, and how the head, 
And all his hourly varied anodynes." 

The first awakening, after an embittered boy- 
hood, " to the dread thought that though other 
clouds might drift westward and dissolve, one 
would impend over me forever " brought with it 
an insistent desire for flight ; and the environ- 
ment of London was forthwith exchanged for a 
lonely plantation in the mountains of India. 
Three years of peacefid meditation in this old- 
world atmosphere were effective in lulling the 
pain ; then came an attack of fever, and with 
convalescence a revulsion of feeling toward the 
slumbrous Oriental existence and a determina- 
tion to meet the old foe, if need be, on the home 
field. Plunging once more into the roaring life 
of London, he summoned to his aid every 
resource of nature, literature, art, and phil- 
osophy that might enable him to endure and 
outbrave the torment ; until gradually, step by 
step, he was led by their ministries to the goal 
that held permanent assuagement — " the pres- 
ence of the Ideal Love." 



" There is a place in every heart which must be 
filled by adoration, or else the whole will grow hard 
and wither like a garden whose central fountain is 
grown dry. And though the affection of mortal man 
or woman may abandon it, there remains yet this other 
love which by pure and strenuous invocation may be 
drawn to it, and dwell in it, to the ennoblement of life ; 
so great is the care of providence for mortal need. 
Love is our need, and it is given, if we despair not of 
it, even to such as have rarely felt the glow of earthly 
passion. For love is of many kinds; yet the palest and 
most subtle of its forms are made real to those who 
believe, and may become the guiding influences of their 
lives. Such are the visions of the ideal love to which 
those glad natural sympathies now led me, leaving me 
alone awhile that I might worship the orient light. And 
when I came out from that presence I rejoiced indeed, 
for the path was clear for my return, and life was now 
glad with promise like an orchard burgeoning with 
white blossoms. Old memories crowded back on me of 
hours beneath the cedars with the Phsedrus and the 
Vita Nuova, hours made happy with intellectual and 
aesthetic delights. But now the joy was other than 
intellectual, though significant tenfold, for then in 
untried youth I had wondered at the beauty of an 
imaginary world; now with eyes that had looked on 
desolation I perceived that these visions were true. For 
had they been no more than aerial fancies, they surely 
had not endured throughout these long ages in our laden 
and mortal air." 

From these heights of the spirit one might indeed 
look out upon life without bitterness. Though 
the chance for happiness had long since withered, 
yet something of serenity was stiU possible ; and 
the old enemy, if not wholly vanquished, was 
yet disabled and subdued. 

From a volume distinguished on every page 
for beauty of style, it is difficult to detach for 
quotation one or two paragraphs of particular dis- 
tinction. Yet perhaps the two we have chosen 
will serve as well as any. This first describes 
the initial onslaught of an Indian monsoon : 

"One year I was witness of the first onset, which 
came in the late afternoon — an immediate shock of 
massed clouds without throwing forward of skirmishers 
or any prelude of the vanguard. Our home looked 
down upon a gentle incline of open grassy land to a 
broad belt of jungle in the middle distance ; here the 
imdergrowth and small trees had been newly cleared 
away, opening a perspective receding across an uncum- 
bered leaf-strewn floor into the backward gloom of the 
forest. I sat with my eyes fixed upon the trees, draw- 
ing the rain on with the whole strength of desire to the 
parched country lying there faint with the exhaustion 
of three months of drought. While I watched, the 
deep line of cloud, at first distinct from the forest-top 
along which it came rolhng, insensibly merged with the 
foliage, until every contour was lost in a common gloom, 
only the great bare stems below standing pale against 
the gathering darkness. There was an intense stillness 
everywhere like the silence of expectation which falls 
upon an awestruck crowd; the very insects had ceased 
their usual song. And now the ear caught a distant 
sound, vague and deep, coming up out of the mid dark-

ness, and growing to a mighty volume as a sudden wind 
swept out from the sounding foliage into the open land 
and searched every cranny of the house as it passed. 
Then, as if drawn by the wind, there came into view 
among the nearest tree-stems a moving grey line 
advancing with a long roar until it hid the whole forest 
from sight: it was the wave of battle about to break 
upon us. It came on like a wall, enormous, irresistible ; 
one instant, and it had devoured the intervening space; 
another, and we were lost in the deluge, and the great 
rain-drops were spilled upon the roof with the noise of 
continuous thunder. As the deep sound reverberated 
through the roof above me, I went in exulting to a 
hearth piled with blazing logs, glad in the prospect of 
renewing for many weeks old and quiet habitudes of 
indoor life, rich with solace of books and tranquil med- 
itation." 

And in the following is set down a subtle experi- 
ence that must have come to every sensitive 
being that ever made his bed beneath the open 
sky. Stevenson has described a similar incident 
not more finely. 

" The exuberant sun of noon distracts, and the mul- 
titude of his beams is troublous, for what does sight 
avail if the things of the heart's desire are lost in im- 
measureable perplexities of light ? For in the high day 
the quivering bright air is more opaque than the dim 
spaces of night, so tranquil and severe, or the glowing 
kingdoms of the morning. At the springing of the day 
the eyes open upon awakening flowers, giving filial heed 
to the marvellous earth which waits in patience for a 
human greeting. I like the passage in which Chaucer 
tells how in May-time his couch was spread in an arbour 
upon the margin of the grass, that he might wake to see 
the daisies unfold their petals. Sleeping thus, he also 
must have known those intervals of slumber when a sense 
of some impending wonder grows too strong for sleep, 
and all nature seems calling you to a vision. Often I 
have been thus awakened, not by noise or movement, 
but as it were by some strange prescience of beauty 
constraining me to rise and look. Once I was drawn 
some distance I'ound the corner of a copse, and there, 
low in the sable-blue of the sky, in a rivalry of intense 
but dazzling light, the crescent moon hung splendid over 
against a great constellation which glittered like a car- 
canet of diamonds. They seemed to speak together as if 
in some scene or passage of celestial drama, nor did I 
know which was the diviner speech, the moon's unwaver- 
ing effulgence or that leaping coruscation of the stars. 
Nothing stirred on the right hand or the left, but earth 
and air were hushed, as if before that colloquy all somid 
and motion were miraculously holden. Tall trees 
brown with densest shadows were massed upon one 
side, obscuring half the heaven, and lending by their 
contrasted gloom that sense of wizardry m natural 
things which enchants the clear summer nights when 
the air is still." 

The shy fraternity will need no word of ours 
to lead them to this book. But we hope that 
what has been said here will turn the lover of 
literature to the volume also, knowing as we do 
that it holds for him a pleasure not often vouch- 
safed in these days of universal scribbling.

Dutch History from the Sources.* 

Simultaneously with the fourth instalment 
of the projected set of five volumes, in English 
translation, of Dr. Blok's " History of the Peo- 
ple of the Netherlands," there comes to the 
reviewer Volume VIII. of the original Dutch, 
which, finishing the fourteenth book, completes 
also the history of the kingdom from the time 
" The Dutch took Holland " after Waterloo, to 
the revision of the Constitution in 1887. The 
end crowns the work, for it rounds out the great 
life-task of the professor of Dutch history in 
Holland's noblest university. Dr. Blok, born at 
the Helder in 1855, took his degree of Doctor 
of Letters at Ley den. After fifteen years spent 
in the teaching of history and in researches 
among the archives of more countries than one, 
on the death of Robert Fruin he was called 
from the same chair at Gronigen University to 
the professorship of Dutch history at his Alma 
Mater. Previous to the first issue of his initial 
volume of the " History of the Dutch People," 
in 1892, his monographs had shown great 
powers of research and correlation of facts, 
besides giving some indications of ability to 
produce a history that should be a work of lit- 
erature as well as of learning. Now that the 
reader of English has already the bulk of the 
story before him, it is possible to judge fairly 
the outcome of the work of a man who may 
indeed in outward guise have grown old in un- 
ceasing labors and profoundest erudition, but 
whose every page shows the enthusiasm and 
fire of youth, and a positive delight in making 
truth as beautiful as her own imperious limita- 
tions will allow. Dr. Blok is neither a Motley 
nor a Macaulay, but for trustworthiness he is 
a leader beyond these masters of rhetoric and 
erudite scholarship. Happily, too. Dr. Blok's 
decidedly modern Dutch style is strongly and 
felicitously rendered by the translator, Mr. 
Oscar A. Bierstadt, who, with his former col- 
laborator. Miss Ruth Putnam, deserves very 
high praise. 

The foregoing should not be taken to mean 
that the average American reader will find 
Blok's " History of the Netherlands " thrilling. 
Unfortunately for the work done by Washing- 
ton Irving, and the perpetual object lesson 
afforded by the bric-a-brac mongers and curio- 
peddlars, helped by not a little after-dinner 
rhetoric from the kind of Dutchmen who can

eat magnificent dinners and be voluble in 
rhetorical praise of their fathers who came to 
America nearly three centuries ago (while the 
equally heroic Dutch Pilgrim Fathers in Michi- 
gan and Iowa of 1840 are too near for glory), 
the contrast of sober facts is too great. It is 
undoubtedly true that the kind of American 
history that gets written in or near Boston and 
very handsomely published on Manhattan Island 
virtually ignores the part which the Dutchmen 
of New York, from 1664 to 1776, played in the 
development of American liberties, so that we 
have the most shocking mistakes and omissions 
in the average popular historian concerning the 
Dutch in America ; yet one must not suppose 
that to the historian of the old Netherlands the 
fortunes of New Netherland are anything more 
than a trifling episode. Avoiding the tempta- 
tion to expatiate on this point, we may add that 
it is difficult to get a clear understanding of 
the early history of our own Middle States 
without a knowledge of the background in the 
Dutch Fatherland, as shown in the lights and 
shadows on the pages of the present volume. 
Amid the currents of thought and opinion, the 
movements of society and polities. Dr. Blok 
leads his readers with a minute knowledge that 
reminds us of the wealth and consummate classi- 
fications of the Rijks Museum. He draws per- 
fectly clear portraits of the great men, who, 
with astonishing frequency, were produced in 
the Netherlands. Indeed, one discerns a very 
miracle of history in the mere existence of a 
republic, positively contemptible as to size, in 
the midst of the monarchies on all sides which 
sought again and again to overwhelm it. In 
this fourth volume we have the story of calm 
after storm, when the great conciliatory states- 
man, Frederich Henry, healed the wounds of 
civil strife and had no small part himself in 
stimulating " the bloom of the Republic." Other 
writers may have shown the genius and patience 
of John De Witt, helmsmen of the ship of state, 
during the time of the " stadholderless republic," 
but none has succeeded in giving us such a clear 
portrait of this quiet thinker who was the best 
type of the Holland regent of those days — 
. " Simple and worthy, incorruptible and stead- 
fast, cool of head and heart, vigorously doing 
his duty to the end "; while of William III. 
a picture is drawn which very handsomely en- 
riches, with both light and shade, our know- 
ledge obtainable from that noble portrait limned 
by Macaulay. As in his previous volumes, Dr. 
Blok presents in an appendix of highest value 
a critical estimate of his sources, an accurate 



colored map of the ever-changing area of the 
Netherlands, in the era described, and a good 
index. We shall look with pleasurable expecta- 
tion for the fifth and concluding volume of the 
English translation of this notable work. 



New Books about Old liANDS.* 



When the writer of a book of travel sets himself 
the task of describing an old land — a land made 
familiar in song and story, in history and legend — 
he must, in order to arouse our interest, appeal to 
us from some new point of view. However hack- 
neyed his theme, however commonplace his style, 
and however lacking his aptitude as a ti-aveller, if 
he possess the faculty of seeing and describing the 
old scenes from a new standpoint he may stimulate 
our jaded senses into something resembling first 
impressions. Much more, indeed, we cannot ask 
of him. In our present list there are such books. 
Central Asia is shown to us as a most interesting 
ground for the study of climatic influences on char- 
acter ; Tyrol is seen through sympathetic modern 
eyes as a mediaeval land ; Persia is presented to us 
by the unique method of one man's seeing it and 
another man's writing about it ; Somaliland, that 
paradise of big-game hunters, is visited by two 
modern Dianas ; and the other books are not im- 
worthy of their company. 

Four years of travelling and living in Asiatic 
Turkey and three years of travel in Central Asia 
make the basis of Mr. Ellsworth Huntington's excel- 
lent book entitled " The Pulse of Asia." The main 
theme of the volume, however, recounts the author's 
journey, made in 1905, through Chinese Turkestan — 
from India through Kashmir, thence along the Kwen 
Lun moimtains to the ancient Lop Nor lake bed, and 
around the eastern slope of the Tien Shan mountains 
to Siberia. Such a route suggests the typical ex- 
plorer's itinerary ; but Mr. Huntington has not been 
in Central Asia for exploring purposes, except in 
an incidental way. Happily, he has a theme which

gives rare interest to his tale of wandering. Be- 
lieving that geography is an important basis for the 
study of anthropological science, and that geography 
and history are inseparable, he has spent these years 
in the arid lands of Asia to prove his thesis. His 
conclusion is that the habits and character of the 
people of Central Asia appear to have been molded 
by physiographic environment ; that " during his- 
toric times, climate, the most important factor in that 
environment, has been subject to notable changes"; 
and finally, "that the changes of climate have caused 
corresponding changes not only in the distribution of 
man, but in his occupations, habits, and even char- 
acter." An instance or two of the proofs advanced 
by the author will probably make his meaning clear. 
The Ladakhis, living in the Himalayas, are a people 
characterized by honesty, courage in spite of super- 
stition, industry, intense love of home, and cheerful- 
ness even in face of adverse circumstances, — traits 
" which seem to make mountaineers, of whatever 
race, better men than the inhabitants of plains, where 
life is easy." In marked contrast to these strong- 
willed people are the Chantos, probably of all races 
the nearest to the primitive Aryan stock. These 
Chantos live in densely populated but small and 
isolated oases. " Their surroundings are pretty and 
attractive, but not varied enough to be inspiring. 
A short period of hard labor suffices to provide sus- 
tenance for the whole year, and the rest of the year 
is given over to prolonged idleness, with leisure 
for more of evil than of good." Hence the Chantos, 
seduced by their environment, are courteous, submis- 
sive, self-indulgent, cowardly, unstable, and feeble in 
parental and family ties. These pictures of contrast 
are very simple, much more simple and condensed 
than in the author's account, which gives in minutest 
detail what we have briefly summarized. In his 
concluding chapter the author attempts to apply his 
thesis to the general course of history and human 
progress, especially to western Asia, North Africa, 
and Europe. Here Mr. Huntington touches on de- 
batable ground, and advances views that are difficult 
of proof. Our space does not permit us to discuss 
these statements, but it is sufficient to suggest that 
the author sees a relationship between the financial 
crises and political changes in the United States 
and the rebellion in Chinese Turkestan, the famines 
in Persia and the Turkish massacres and revolts — 
all due in some measure to climatic variations and 
conditions. Whatever our conclusions may be in 
regard to Mr. Huntington's theories, we must allow 
him the credit of remarkably lucid presentation of a 
complex scientific question. Maps, a list of refer- 
ences, and especially an excellent index, enhance the 
physical features of the volume. 

Mr. W. A. Baillie-Grohmann, the author of the 
volume on "Tyrol: The Land in the Mountains," 
finds a good excuse for writing another book about 
this beautifully picturesque land, in the complaint of 
Englishmen and Americans "that there is no history, 
be it ever so brief a one, of the country, in the lan- 
guage that they can read." To supply this demand 



the author writes most entertainingly of the history 
of Tyrol, and especially of its " old castles that bear 
upon their crumbling walls the impress of old age 
to a degree not found elsewhere." Very wittily the 
writer adds that both the contents of the book and 
the author of it possess the qualification of age. But 
Mr. Baillie-Grohmann needs no apology for himself 
or his book. His other books, especially " Sport in 
the Alps" and "Camps. in the Rockies," are suffi- 
cient proof that he has a quick eye and a facile pen. 
Moreover, this volume, like his other books, is an 
honest piece of work, devoid of adventitious and 
alien interest. His history of Tyrol (he deprecates 
the usual designation of the Tyrol) is almost entirely 
concerned with the Middle Ages ; but he brings the 
account of the country down to the last quarter of 
the nineteenth century. Around " Schloss Matzen," 
his own castle home, he gathers interesting stories of 
the ancient knights and noble ladies ; of the Brenner 
Pass, the oldest pass in the Alps, and of the famous 
mediaeval travellers who crossed it ; of the peasantry 
of the past and the present ; of life and art in the 
ancient castles ; of the the typical Tyrolese knights, 
the Frundsbergs, who lived at Mataen Castle; and 
of " Schloss Matzen " in modern times. Of neces- 
sity many pages in the book must be a dull catalogue 
of uninteresting facts and almost eventless dates ; but 
the author seldom fails to illuminate the darkness of 
mediaeval history with some narrative or anecdote 
which heightens the epical tone of his work. Tyrol 
has produced her giants and her strong men, and 
Mr. BaUlie-Grohmann does not disdain to tell of 
them in a book carrying a heavy freight of mediaeval 
history. To the mere " tripper " who knows Tyrol 
only from the piazza of an Innsbruck hotel, this book 
will not appeal ; but to the more serious traveller 
and reader it wUl mark a valuable contribution to 
the history of a brave little land, rich in story and 
legend and strong in faith and courage. Over eighty 
good illustrations, showing characteristic scenes of 
mountains and hamlets, cottage interiors with their 
quaint furniture and even kitchen utensils, castle 
scenes with their antique curiosities and portraits of 
notable Tyrolese, add dignity and value to the vol- 
ume. Not least among the interesting features of 
the book is a sketch of the author written by his 
American friend, Mr. Charles Landis. 

" Pekin to Paris," by Seiior Luigi Barzini, is the 
story of Prince Borghese's remarkable journey 
across Asia and Europe in a motor-car. On Feb- 
ruary 15, 1907, Prince Borghese, having accepted 
the challenge issued by the Paris " Matin," began a 
hasty but well-appointed preparation for the race, 
and soon started for Pekin, whence the race was to 
start. On June 10, five cars started on their eight 
thousand mile course. For two months the strong 
and heavy car " Italia " plunged or crept or ploughed 
or whisked through rivers, sands, quagmires, over 
rocks and by woodlands ; sometimes it moved of its 
own power, sometimes it was pulled along by a host 
of Chinese coolies, at other times it was assisted by 
animal power, — but it was ever going forward. In

the Chinese Empire the party met the almost irri- 
sistible rocks of Ki-mi-ni ; in the Mongolian deserts 
the sands were almost too much for the machine ; in 
the Russian Empire they availed themselves of the 
rails of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Thus they 
came to the western borders of the Russian Empire, 
to the good roads of Germany and the better ones 
of France, and to their journey's end. Difficult as 
that journey was, the party was most fortunate in 
almost every stage of the trip. Had it not been for 
the assistance of the local and the national govern- 
ments, had it not been that their fuel and lubricators 
were always at the appointed places, and, more than 
all else, had their unfortunate accidents proved 
serious or fatal, they could never have accomplished 
their purpose. Some of their escapes were hardly 
short of providential. Once their car plunged 
through a bridge, making such havoc of both bridge 
and car that the picture showing the catastrophe 
makes one marvel at the escape of the occupants of 
the car. Prince Borghese was "jammed between 
a beam and the engine of the car, crushed by it, 
unable to breathe. With the strength which comes 
to men sometimes at a crisis, he somehow raised the 
car for an instant and freed himself." The car 
was a forty horse-power machine, weighing over 
four thousand pounds ! Notwithstanding such hin- 
drances and accidents, the journey ended at the office 
of the "Matin" on August 10 — two months from 
the time of starting. The volume contains an inter- 
esting and modest introduction by the Prince, a 
hundred good illustrations, and an excellent detailed 
map showing the route traversed. Sefior Barzini's 
style, as translated by Sefior De Castelvecchio, is 
best described by Prince Borghese as vivacious : no 
other style could possibly do justice to the subject. 
Prince Borghese quite agrees with those persons 
who asserted that such a journey was impossible, — 
for "it is impossible to go by motor-car alone, com- 
fortably seated on the cushions of the same, from 
Pekin to Paris." 

Bottom's assertion that " a lion among ladies is a 
most dreadful thing " is reversed in Miss Agnes 
Herbert's ." Two Dianas in SomalUand." Miss 
Herbert and her cousin Cecily proved most dread- 
ful among the lions, leopards, rhinoceroses, wolves, 
hyenas, deer, and "other fearful wild-fowl" — to 
adopt Bottom's classification. Having gathered some 
experience as a huntress in the Canadian Rockies, 
and being a niece of a famous African hunter, Miss 
Herbert is not a novice in big-game shooting and 
its requirements. After equipping for the hunt at 
Berbera, where, very fortunately, they procured the 
services of Miss Herbert's uncle's former Shikari 
( chief hunter) and head man, these two women (they 
admit being thirty years old) set out to penetrate the 
Ogaden country and beyond to the Marehan and the 
Haweera districts. Their trip, extending over four 
months' time, was signalized by exciting adventures, 
some comical, others serious, and one fatal — the 
last being the occasion of the death of a native 
who was gored to death by a wounded rhinoceros. 



Miss Herbert tells of this nerve-racking accident with 
modest recital, leaving much to the imagination of 
the reader, who will readily appreciate the bravery 
of a woman who can fearlessly meet a maddened 
charging rhinoceros, and kill the animal in the face 
of imminent danger. At another time. Miss Herbert, 
who seems to have garnered her full share of the 
accidents, became lost in the dense thickets with a 
man-servant, and spent an anxious night amid the 
weird sounds and sights of an African jungle. 
Among the many interesting episodes recounted in 
the volume is one of a lion hunt. The party had 
just jumped a lion, which, after seriously injuring a 
native, crashed into the thick underbrush. For half 
an hour Miss Herbert crawled through the brush, 
when suddenly she saw the swishing yellow tail of 
the animal. So adroitly had she made her approach 
that the lion neither saw nor heard her. At this 
point Miss Herbert writes : 

" The air was stifling, and oh ! how heavily I weighed on 
my knees ! . . . I carefully got my rifle. It seemed a long 
business. Did I really make no noise ? Strange crackling 
rustlings sounded in miy ears, as at each g^owl I seized the 
opportunity, and in the semi-obscurity of the reverberations 
placed myself better. The lion came more into focus. I 
saw his side where it sank in, then — farther. A heart- 
shaking second. My bullet was too low. The vast body 
lashed round and round. I seemed to see what my fate would 
be in another instant. My breath was coming in great sobs, 
and I wondered whether the lion was choking or I. All this 
was in the fraction of a moment. Then came my opportunity. 
His chest presented itself fair and square like a target. I 
pressed my second trigger, and threw myself backwards and 
went somehow as though the devil himself was after me." 

LuckUy for the lady, the lion was killed by the shot. 

After resigning his commission in the Royal Field 
Artillery in India, in 1903, Mr. E. Crawshay 
Williams determined to return home to England by 
crossing Persia from sea to sea. In his volume 
entitled " Across Persia " he tells of his journey in 
a pleasant and leisurely manner. Sailing from 
Bombay, he landed at Bushire on the little island 
west of Persia ; from Bushire he went to Shief, in 
Persia, the " land of the Lion and the Sun " — 
though the lions no longer exist. From Shief he 
set out with his caravan over the monotonous waste 
land, stopping at some intermediate points, and 
came to Dalki, beautiful in coloring, with the yellow 
sulphur ridges, pale green hills, high pink peaks, 
and greenish rivers, all under the blue Eastern sky. 
Passing through the mountains, the writer came to 
Kazerun, where he saw the first orange and pome- 
granate gardens ; thence he travelled to the white- 
stoned city of ruins, Sliapur. Shiraz, the city of roses 
and nightingales, and famous for its tombs of Hafiz 
and Saadi, interested our author greatly. The 
tombs of Xerxes, Artaxerxes, and Darius II. at 
Naksh-i-Rustum, and the burial-place of the great 
Cyrus at Sivand, were also visited and described at 
length. An interesting part of the book tells of a 
ride of two hundred and fifty miles in a victoria to 
Kashan, a commercial centre, and to Kum, the city 
of sanctity, where the Persian Westminster Abbey 
is situated. Teheran, the capital, is described as a

city where East and West meet — the bazaars of 
the East and the tram-lines of the West. Mr. 
Williams left Teheran and Persia by caravan. Like 
all travellers in Persia, he comments on the short- 
comings of the Persian — especially his disregard 
for the truth, his dislike of work, and his propensi- 
ties for thieving. Yet notwithstanding these defi- 
ciencies, Mr. Williams says a kind word for the 
Persian's hospitable and companionable spirit, for 
his good nature, his childlike unconcern and light- 
heartedness. Mr. Williams travelled, like Stevenson, 
with the hopeful heart, and his book echoes the same 
spirit. For these reasons his traveller's tale has 
charm and serenity. Picture and text are mutually 
helpful and interesting to the reader. 

Very different from Mr. Williams's scholarly 
work is the volume entitled "Queer Things about 
Persia." The authors of this correctly named book, 
M. Eustache de Lorey and Mr. Douglas Sladen (the 
latter the author of a similarly titled book about 
Japan), wi'ote the volume by an unusual method of 
collaboration. M. Lorey, for two years an attacM 
to the French Legation at Teheran, furnished the 
materials and the experience for the book, and Mr. 
Sladen, who has never been in Persia, wrote down 
the chapters from dictation. Yet this queer collabo- 
ration about queer things in Persia has not impaired 
the interest of the story. Persia, however, does not 
mean all Persia, — it means (as Paris is France to 
all Parisians) Teheran, the capital of Persia; and 
Teheran spells, for the most part, the bazaars (five 
chapters are given to this topic), the palace of the 
King of Kings, the Shah, the harems, the Persian 
women, Persian politics and religion. A catalogue 
of the many topics treated would much resemble the 
extravagances of an Arabian Nights' tale. Mystic 
Persia, with its conglomeration of dancers, gamblers, 
dervishes, banquets, spices, wines, nightingales, 
weddings, divorces, polygamy, religious fanaticisms, 
astrology, superstition, lies and thefts, street dogs, 
hashish-smoking, and a thousand other queer things, 
are all presented in such colors and with such 
high lights that they almost form a worthy com- 
panion piece to the immortal Arabian tales read 
in our childhood. This is the sort of book which 
will appeal to the casual reader of books of travel, 
and it will not be uninteresting even to the well-read 
student of Persian life and manners. 

Notwithstanding the proximity of the United 
States to South America, and in spite of the 
ostentatious paternalism manifested in the Monroe 
Doctrine, we as a people have only the vaguest con- 
ception of our sister continent on the Equator. 
England and Germany, on the other hand, are not 
so hazy in their perceptions of the great commercial 
and industrial possibilities of that naturally rich 
country. Dr. Albert Hale, in his book entitled 
"The South Americans," with the additional nota- 
tion on the title-page, "The Story of the South 
American Republics, their Characteristics, Progress, 
and Tendencies ; with Special Reference to their 
Commercial Relations with the United States," seeks 



to arouse our dormant paternalism into some definite 
activity which will bring our land a commensurate 
share of South American riches. The situation is 
verjs simply stated by Dr. Hale : 

" The nations of Europe are crowded and South America 
offers the only available land on earth into which the surplus 
can overflow. 

" Omitting the coast-line and the Orinoco valley of Vene- 
zuela, the sug-ar country and the Amazon Valley of Brazil, 
and the upper reaches of the ParanA and Paraguay in 
Argentina, the remaining area, vast as it is and lying partly 
within the tropics or mountain snows, is as capable of sup- 
porting the white man as the United States or Canada." 

Dr. Hale discusses the productive possibilities of 
South America in a very thorough-going manner. 
He presents, in a plain matter-of-fact way, the inter- 
esting and often exciting history of the principal 
South American States, outlines their leading geo- 
graphical features, discusses their local governments 
and foreign relationships, and analyzes their social 
and mental life. No recent book on South America 
is so well adapted to the needs of the general reader 
as is this one. Its make-up and illustrations are 
particularly pleasing. 

Another interesting and timely book on a South 
American subject is " The Andes and the Amazon," 
by Mr. C. Reginald Enock. Ancient Peruvians re- 
sented the Spanish marauder who sacked their 
treasures, but modern Peruvians long for commerce, 
the new buccaneer, to open the desert places of her 
wealth and to exploit her natural advantages to the 
world. In some measure Mr. Enock does adver- 
tise the natural wealth of Peru, but he does not 
neglect the story of her ancient days. He crossed 
the country from the west to the east, over the 
burning yellow sands, climbing the snow-covered 
peaks to visit the ancient habitations of a race 
remembered in story, and thence passed down into 
the fertile valleys and forests of the Amazon and 
the Maranon. His rovings were conducted in such 
a hearty spirit, with such a commendable leisure, 
and are written down in such a pleasing manner, 
that his book adds much to our rapidly accumulating 
library on South American affairs. Had the author, 
however, depended more on his kodak and less on 
his ill-drawn pictures of many scenes, his book 
would have gained in attractiveness. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the automobile is 
now in the dull catalogue of common things, and 
that, in consequence, our hastening days fly on in 
full career, we are not likely to associate the " gran 
huon macchina" with the glories of Italian art. 
Yet this is exactly what Mr. Dan Fellows Piatt has 
done ; and he has associated the two without any 
violent shock to our artistic or nervous temperament. 
His volume entitled "Through Italy with Car and 
Camera " tells of his pilgi'image last year, from early 
October to late January, to more than four-score 
Italian towns and cities. Mr. Piatt's primary pur- 
pose was to make a general review of Italian art, espe- 
cially of Italian pictures. Over two hundred excellent 
reproductions, most of them of paintings, attest that 
his camera served him as well as did his motor-car.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Of the mere trip the author displays a commendable 
consideration in not subjecting the reader who enjoys 
art more than motoring to an extended recital of the 
haps and mishaps of the machine ; nor does he g6 too 
deeply into detail in his raptures about the scenery — 
a truly commendable reserve ; but with that touch- 
and-go spirit which the motor-car encourages, and 
the Italian scenery in the latter part of the year 
intensifies, he devotes his energies to the criticism 
of art. As a critic of art Mr. Piatt is by no means 
commonplace and conventional. He does, indeed, 
cast down some of the ancient idols, but he is not a 
destroyer of all the cherished images. He is thank- 
ful, for instance, that Raphael did not live ten years 
longer. " I dread to think what the art of the great 
genius would have degenerated into by that time. 
Superlative facility dethrones Raphael. Greatest of 
draughtsmen, his popularity lessened his inspiration. 
His reputation will grow less with the centuries. 
However great his powers, his pictures proclaim that 
longer life would not have made him the equal of 
Michael Angelo, Titian or Velasquez." We need 
not argue with Mr. Piatt in regard to his criticism, 
but we may commend his temperate expression on 
so radical a theory. As we glance over the many pic- 
tures in the volume, and as we study the road-map, 
we are inclined to say that Mr. Piatt has made an 
ideal trip in an ideal way, and that his book is worthy 
of the pilgrimage. H. E. Coblektz. 



Briefs on New Books. 

The latest ^^' Edmund Gosse has written a 

biographer volume on Henrik Ibsen for the 

of ibseti. series of biographies called " Literary 

Lives," published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. Mr. Gosse is entitled to write upon this sub- 
ject because of his life-long interest in Ibsen's work, 
and because it was he who first gave any account of 
that work to the English public. Moreover, writing 
at the present date, he has the advantage over pre- 
vious biographers in being able to make use of the 
Ibsen letters, and the other biographical and remin- 
iscential matter that has appeared since the drama- 
tist's death. There is a great deal of this material 
altogether, and Mr. Gosse has made good use of it. 
But in spite of these advantages, he has by no means, 
as he seems to think, made " obsolete " the standard 
biography of Ibsen by Henrik Jaeger. That solid 
performance is likely to outlast many such books as 
the one Mr. Gosse has given us, agreeable and 
informing as it is, and it hardly becomes him to 
belittle a work which is so much more searching 
and philosophical than his own. One passage in the 
present volume may be quoted as indicative of the 
sanity of the writer's general conception of his sub- 
ject. The " obsession of the critic to discover 
problems in the work of Ibsen has been one of the 
main causes of that impatience and even downright 
injustice with which his writings have been received 



by a large section of those readers who should nat- 
urally have enjoyed them. He is a poet, of fantastic 
wit and often reckless imagination, and he has been 
travestied in a long black coat and white choker, as 
if he were an embodiment of the Nonconformist 
conscience." This stricture upon a great deal of 
current Ibsen criticism is essentially just, and Mr. 
Gosse is careful not to err in the same sense. Mr. 
Gosse also remembers that he is writing for English 
readers, who know next to nothing of the intellectual 
antecedents and environment of a Scandinavian man 
of letters, and his book has the meritorious quality 
of explaining these influences, most of which are 
taken for granted by Jaeger, as they naturally would 
be by any biographer of Ibsen's own race. On one 
small point we can supply the writer with a bit of 
information that should interest him. He says that 
the famous narrative poem, " Terje Vigen," " will 
never be translated successfully into English." But 
it has been translated, with remarkable success, by 
Mr. Percy W. Shedd, and the version may be found 
in his volume of poems entitled " The Oceanides" 
published about six years ago. In connection with 
these comments upon the latest of Ibsen biographies 
we may record the fact that the eleven-volume edi- 
tion of Ibsen's plays, prepared under the supervision 
of Mr. William Archer, has at last been completed. 
The volume which now fills the set is noteworthy 
for including Professor C. H. Herford's version of 
*' Love's Comedy," which is only less remarkable 
than the same translator's version of " Brand." 
These two works, in their English form, are so 
vastly superior to the Archer translations in whose 
company they are included that they constitute a 
class by themselves. 

Further The new edition of Mr. W. S. 

meBurbank Harwood's " New Creations in Plant 
gardens. Life " (Macmillan) consists in bring- 

ing to the earlier volume with the same title two 
new chapters designed to give the reader more 
perfect knowledge of " spineless " cacti, Carnegie 
subventions, and new horticultural experiments, and 
in general to bring the history of the " acts " of Mr. 
Burbank down to date. In these chapters, the same 
florid and inflated style, the same extravagance of 
statement, which have marked all of Mr. Harwood's 
writing, still appear. The more is the pity; for 
Mr. Burbank has really done some very good work, 
and his services to California and to the world 
should not be rendered ridiculous by bombast and 
over-praise. Our author seems to ignore entirely 
the fact that there have been other gardeners in the 
world, that there are other countries than California, 
and other fruits than those originating in Santa Rosa. 
Even the vaunted cactus as presented here is made 
to play a role of extreme uncertainty. Surprising 
as it may seem, a cactus is nevertheless, in all that 
goes to make up vegetation, exactly like any other 
green plant. It must have light, it must have water 
and food of various sorts. The cactus differs from 
its congeners chiefly in that it can retain for a long

time water once absorbed. No cactus can live 
without water, much less create it. The cactus can 
endure drouth ; it can stand on the desert and wait 
for rain, store the rain when it comes, using it 
slowly and waiting for the rain to come again ; but 
the amount and rapidity of growth for the cactus, 
as for any other green plant, depends upon the 
amount of food and water it can secure. It is said 
that ninety-five per cent of the cactus produced at 
Santa Rosa is water. Probably so ; but such an 
amount of water absorbed by the cactus indicates 
an amoimt of rainfall far in excess of that of an 
ordinary desert; so that even if we have in the 
spineless cactus a plant suitable for forage, the 
chances that it may ever occupy the desert are 
simply those of successful irrigation — nothing 
more. It is claimed at Santa Rosa that in the 
newly " created " cacti, dwellers in the desert are 
to find a new and unfailing food supply. New it 
would no doubt be, but unfailing, even if acceptable, 
is more than doubtful. Hungry humanity is likely 
long to go hungry still, or ever it find in tuna 
roasts and opuntia puddings the relief from starva- 
tion which Mr. Harwood's enthusiasm would point 
out to "those who live where famine stalks." It 
were to be hoped that the new relations in which 
Mr. Burbank stands with the Carnegie foundation 
would at length give to the world a reasonable and 
credible scientific account of what is actually being 
accomplished in these present-day gardens of 
Hesperis. As said at the outset, Mr. Burbank has 
really done some good work, but the critical reader 
of " New Creations in Plant Life " will be stiU un- 
certain both as to its amount and kind. 



Commencement University and college addresses are 
addresses of beginning to take up a rather large 
the right sort. gp^ge on the library shelf. One of 
the latest volumes to reach our hand embodies the 
counsel of Dr. Albert Shaw to various student bodies, 
and bears as its title " The Outlook for the Average 
Man" (Macmillan). Any address at a commence- 
ment or similar occasion is bound to be optimistic, 
so we may merely pray that the optimism will be 
sane and sanely presented. As we should expect, 
our prayer is fulfilled in the case of Dr. Shaw. He 
does not blink the existence of tremendous social and 
economic problems ; but he bids the young man face 
them hopefully, " believing in our people, our country, 
our institutions." On capitalism and materialism we 
shall see reared the stately structure of a higher 
civilization. In the process we need not shrink 
from realities : the man who offers the farmer an 
effective commercial fertilizer to spread on his fields 
" is a veritable angel for the spread of sweetness and 
light." " There is as much room for the delightful 
play of the faculty of imagination in the successful 
conduct of a soap business as in writing poetry." 
The forceful words of this last sentence, however, 
are slightly misleading if taken by themselves ; for 
our speaker does look eagerly and hopefully beyond 
the material soap factory to the ultimately more 



satisfying bubbles of idealism. The latest half dozen 
volumes similar to the present work compel an older 
man to think of the change from the commencement 
address as it flourished thirty years ago. To-day 
the young man does not hear so much about " hitch- 
ing his wagon to a star," and a great deal more about 
" whether a college education pays." It is true that 
the speakers invariably conclude that education does 
pay, and always introduce a little savor of the ideal ; 
but the change is very striking, and, to some of us 
at least, not altogether comforting. When all is said 
and done the wagon and the star had something final 
on their side. To return to Dr. Shaw, we may say 
that his volume, although frankly remaining a series 
of talks rather than a book, has more unity than 
most collections of this sort ; and that it is hopeful 
and helpful. His methods of expression are too well 
known to need comment ; but in one paragraph we 
seemed to feel in our heart an old-fashioned craving 
for shall instead of wUl. The arrangement of the 
printed page, with its marginal summaries, is a real 
boon to the busy reading eye. 

A short ^^- ^' ^- Matthews's little book 

treatise on a on "The Principles of Intellectual 
imve theme. Education " ( Putnam ) shows that the 
writer is thoroughly familiar with the ideas of both 
of the great German schools of pedagogy, — the 
outgoing activity emphasized by Froebel, and the 
inworking of the world upon the growing mind which 
is the foundation of Herbart's doctrine. The very 
fact that one could not well say that the author 
leans distinctly to either side shows that he is not 
a slavish follower but a self-respecting thinker. To 
most readers, the most interesting chapter will be 
that on the study of foreign languages. Four lan- 
guages are in the field (for the English school), 
Latin, Greek, French, and German. The author 
argues cogently for a modern rather than an ancient 
language to be studied first ; then, rather to our 
surprise, for German in preference to French ; 
finally, to our great satisfaction, for Greek in prefer- 
ence to Latin. Space does not permit any extended 
report of his arguments : they are well worth the 
attention of teachers, especially those on the literary 
side of the currictilum. Not a few ancient super- 
stitions are demolished by the reasoning en route; for 
example, the supposititious value of the complexity 
of Latin : "If this argument is to be pressed, we 
may as well adopt the most complicated language 
that can be found — Russian, perhaps, or at all 
events Greek" (p. 83). Old "formal discipline" 
is hardly used : " To regard, as some have done, the 
learning of the first declension as of inestimable value 
in itself — what is this but to talk sheer nonsense ? " 
(p. 83). It is good to find even an English writer 
discarding the use of the term " humanities " to 
denote the classic literatures and languages — a 
usage which has been abolished by the progress of 
the world and should be abandoned by thoughtful 
persons. The humanities are of course what they 
always were — literature, history, biography, and

what Mr. Matthews calls " geographical history or 
historical geography." To the vast majority to-day, 
and doubtless to the increasing majority, these sub- 
jects are revealed through the vernacular, not through 
any learned tongue. For the child, our author wisely 
advises, biography is the true form of humanistic 
culture. To teachers of English literature in all 
climes his parable from " Alice in Wonderland " is 
to be commended : '" I am so hot and thirsty,' says 
Alice. ' I know what you 'd like,' the Queen said 
good-naturedly. ' Have a biscuit ? ' " The book has 
yet one merit that is far too rare in these days : it 
is delightfully short — only a hundred and thirty 
pages ; one actually is sorry there is not more of it, 
and what greater compliment than this can be paid 
to a book on a serious subject ? 

„ ^. , The great interest in eartliquakes 

their causes which was awakened m this country 

and results. ]^y ^j^g g^n Francisco disaster more 

than justifies the new work on this subject by Pro- 
fessor William Herbert Hobbs, of the Department 
of Geology in the University of Michigan. The 
rate of progress of seismology at the present time is 
very rapid. Old ideas are being exploded, and new 
theories are coming to the front. The relations of 
our geological knowledge of the structure of the 
earth's crust to the location of areas subject to 
frequent earthquakes are being better understood. 
To various phases of the subject the author has 
already contributed several scientific monographs, 
but in the present work he displays signal ability in 
popularizing the results of scientific inquiry. No 
intelligent layman can look at this book without 
being interested, or can read it without substantial 
gain in knowledge. After a brief historical review 
of earthquake theories from the times of the Greek 
philosophers downward, the author devotes half a 
dozen chapters to present-day explanations of the 
causes of these disturbances, and the broad lines of 
their results as manifested in the changes wrought 
upon the earth's surface. The much neglected topic 
of the influence of seismic disturbances upon the 
flow of streams — above ground and subterranean — 
receives due attention. Four chapters are devoted 
to accoimts of great earthquakes, from that which 
destroyed Lisbon in 1 755 down to the catastrophes 
at San Francisco and Kingston. Sea-quakes receive 
brief mention. The various forms of instruments 
for measuring the magnitude and form of earth 
tremors are described, and the earth autographs 
which they give are interpreted. The book is finely 
illustrated with twenty-four full-page plates and one 
hundred and twelve text illustrations. ( Appleton.) 

Among the desiderata of literary 
the history history enumerated by the late 

of couture. Ferdinand Brunetiere was a history 

of the study of the classics in all ages and countries. 
This want has now been met, and the partial or 
sketchy treatises of Grafenhan, Heeren, Bursian, 
and more recently Gudeman, have been in large 



measure superseded for English readers by Dr. 
Sandys's " History of Classical Scholarship " (Cam- 
bridge University Press; New York: Putnam), of 
which the second edition of the first volume now 
appears, revised and enlarged from 672 to 702 
pages. The much anticipated second volume, which 
will continue the history from the end of the Middle 
Ages through the Renaissance down to the present 
day, is announced as in the press. The whole will 
constitute an indispensable work of reference, and 
for serious readers a readable chapter in the general 
history of civilization and culture. For its classical 
scholarship is no small part of the culture of the 
most scientific and modern century, and for such 
periods as the Renaissance and Middle Ages it is 
the foundation and presupposition of the whole. 
Dr. Sandys, who in his leisure hours is " Public 
Orator in the University of Cambridge," had already, 
in his edition of Aristotle's Politeia, shown his skill 
in the compilation and presentation in serviceable 
shape of great collections of facts. The present 
work exhibits on a larger scale his happy combina- 
tion of English sanity and German erudition. To 
summarize or criticise this vast mass of detail would 
be obviously impossible, and to single out some iso- 
lated point for animadversion and dissent is obvi- 
ously unfair. Suffice it to say that the work, 
parallel but not identical in theme with Professor 
Saintsbury's " History of Criticism," though it still 
leaves open the great subject of the influence of the 
classics in other literatures, more than fulfils the 
promise of its title. It is for many periods virtually 
a history of literature from a special point of view. 
The entire literatures of Greece and Rome are 
surveyed in the endeavor to bring out everything of 
critical or philological significance. And the biblio- 
graphies, the chapter and verse citations in the 
foot-notes, the chronological tables, the illustrations, 
and the fuU index, combine to make this one of the 
most valuable works of ready reference upon the 
scholar's shelf.

bestowing so generously upon the soldiers and states- 
men who were their contemporaries. Their work, 
she admits, was often immature and crude, but it 
helped to establish literary standards, and its ser- 
vices in shaping our government and in encourag- 
ing our industries and our educational system were 
invaluable. And if the poems, plays, novels, and 
pamphlets of these early writers make dull reading 
to-day, their lives are generally eventful and interest- 
ing enough to repay study. Professor Moses Coit 
Tyler confined his studies to Colonial and Revolu- 
tionary literature. Mrs. Marble, in her " Heralds

title-pages or illustrations of inaccessible volumes. 
An extensive bibliography, carefully classified, a 
full index, and careful annotation will commend the 
book to students. Mrs. Marble writes fully and en- 
tertainingly of Francis Hopkinson, Philip Freneau, 
John TrumbuU, Joseph Dennie, William Dunlop, 
and Charles Brockden Brown ; and notwithstanding 
her prejudice against classification by eras and local- 
ities she has entitled one chapter " A Group of 
Hartford Wits." It wiU be noticed that all these 
writers, unlike the diarists and statesmen who pre- 
ceded them and whose contribution to literature was 
purely occasional, produced more or less professional 
work. Together they make up the epoch of transi- 
tion which was speedily to mature in the work of 
Irving, Poe, and the New England school. This 
era is barely touched upon in Professor Barrett 
Wendell's "History of American Literature," to 
the earlier chapters of which Mrs. Marble's book 
makes an admirable supplement. (University of 

Chicago Press.) 

The story of her own early years 
which Miss Cipriani tells in "A 
Tuscan Childhood" (Century Co.) 
might seem little out of the ordinary to Italian 
readers, but to Americans it has the interest of 
constantly suggested contrast. Would it be possible 
to impose the system of the Cipriani household on 
American children? and if so, what would be the 
result? This system divided the family of seven 
into two mutually exclusive groups, prescribed with 
almost military exactness the hours for the activities 
of each group, and forbade asking questions, making 
complaints, or speaking to strangers. But there were 
intellectual liberties to match material restraints. 
From English nurses and German governesses and 
tutors the children learned to speak four languages 
by the time they were seven years old, and acquired 
a cosmopolitan store of ideas. They walked and 
travelled and read, and were cultivated far beyond 
American children of equal age. Miss Cipriani's 
story is told with delightful simplicity, and with 
little attempt at the child-study method. With gen- 
erosity and good literary judgment she shares the 
place of leading character with her mother, whose 
early life was even more interesting than her own. 
The book has an attractively pictured cover, but 
otherwise is without illustrations.

Probably there are not many nowa- 
days who read "that wonderful 
sumptuous dress, bo^k," as Walter Pater called it,— 
the " Hydriotaphia, or Urne-Buriall." But even 
were their number fewer than it is, the sumptuous 
reprint just issued from the Riverside Press would 
not lack for welcome, as the edition of less than four 
hundred copies should be all too small to satisfy 
those who will covet the volume for the sake of its 
beautiful externals. The book is a thin quarto, 
printed on handmade paper from the " Brimmer " 
type, with marginal notes in italics. As in all the 
Riverside Press editions, typography and presswork 



are faultless. A wood-engraved title-page by Mr. 
M. Lament Brown, and an elaborately-stamped cover 
of crimson leather, are pleasing decorative features. 
Certainly Sir Thomas Browne's cheerless but elo- 
quent classic has never received a worthier setting, 
nor is it likely to hereafter. It should be said that 
the text, with some slight modifications, follows that 
of the first edition, printed in 1658. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. have just published a new 
and cheaper edition of Miss Gertrude Lowthian Bell's 
" Syria: the Desert and the Sown." The many illus- 
trations from photographs which appeared in the first 
issue of the book are reproduced, and do much to stim- 
ulate interest in Miss Bell's account of her adventurous 
journey through the Holy Land. 

Since the publication, in 1900, of " The Life and 
Letters of Phillips Brooks," an abridgement has often 
been called for, on the ground that many people who 
would like to know something of Phillips Brooks have 
not time to read so full a biography. In many cases, 
too, the cost might be prohibitive. Accordingly, the 
author of the longer life, Dr. Alexander V. G. Allen, 
has finally prepared a biography in the compass of one 
thick octavo volmne (Dutton), aiming to present in 
condensed form the essentials of the great preacher's 
life and the spirit of his teachings. 

Appropriate to the recent Whittier centenary cele- 
bration, and forming a most desirable souvenir of that 
occasion, is the little volume lately issued by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. containing a sketch of the 
poet's life by Mr. Bliss Perry, and a score of Whittier's 
poems illustrating the circumstances of his boyhood and 
the spiritual view-points of his various periods. Two 
portraits, rarely if ever before reproduced, illustrate the 
volume. Besides the regular edition, some four hundred 
copies have been printed on larger and better paper, 
with imcut edges and the portraits in photogravure. 
For those who appreciate fine book-making, this latter 
edition will be found well worth the difference in price. 

The latest volume in " The Connoisseur's Library " 
(Putnams) has for its subject " Goldsmiths' and Silver- 
smiths' Work." Mr. Nelson Dawson is the author. His 
point of view differs from that of the writers of many 
other collectors' manuals in that he seeks to emphasize 
artistic workmanship rather than the factitious values 
dependent upon rarity and uniqueness. He makes no 
attempt at strict classification or characterization of the 
collective work of any period. His method is rather 
to select representative specimens, from Etruscan and 
Mycensean periods down to eighteenth century English 
work, and to give a detailed account of the appearance 
and special attractions of each object. The result is a 
history of antique gold and silver work, treated from 
the artist's point of view. There are no formal accoimts 
of great craftsmen, but the methods that differentiated 
the productions of all the old workmen from those of 
their successors of to-day are explained, and a plea is 
made for a return to the better times when the design 
and the execution were under the supervision, if not in 
the hands, of one man. The plates, which are photo- 
gravures of fine quafity, reproduce over a hundred and 
twenty-five articles in gold or silver, and there are other 
smaller illustrations in the text.

E. F. Nichols; and " Mathematics," by Professor C. J. 
Keyser. 

The Macmillan Co. pubUsh " Who 's Who " for 1908, 
which means the sixtieth annual issue of that invaluable 
book of reference. Despite deaths, the list grows 
steadily longer, and now occupies well over two thou- 
sand pages of closely-printed matter. The number of 
American entries seems to be increasing, but we have 
never been able to understand the capricious principle 
of their selection. 



Mr. Charles Welsh, compiler of the " Golden Trea- 
sury of Irish Songs and Lyrics," has nearly ready for 
publication a collection of sea songs, entitled " Songs 
for Sailors." While it contains many of the classic sea 
songs of British origin, the greater part of the anthology 
consists of songs inspired by events in the history of 
our own navy. 

Following closely upon the publication of Dr. Horace 
Howard Furness's new volume of the Variorum Edition 
of Shakespeare, "Antony and Cleopatra," comes the 
announcement from Lippincott's that another volume of 
this edition will be issued early in the new year. This 
will be " Richard III.," edited by Mr. Horace Howard 
Furness, Jr., and will bring the total number of volumes 
to sixteen. 

Holger Drachmann, as the "Athenseum" tells us, 
is to be buried at Skagen, the fishing village that often 
figures in his poetry and prose. Here his ashes will be 
placed in a sandhill facing the North Sea. The crema- 
tion took place in Copenhagen, and the urn was carried 
with the escort of a torchlight procession to the steamer. 
The poet left several completed MSS., including some 
plays and a novel. 

Promoters of school entertainments will be grateful 
to the Misses Elizabeth McFadden and Lilian Davis 
for their compilation of " A Selected List of Plays for 
Amateurs and Students of Dramatic Expression in 
Schools and Colleges." All interests are here repre- 
sented, including such special ones as plays for children, 
out-door plays, and Christmas plays. The book is obtain- 
able from Miss McFadden, Box 328, Cincinnati. 

Dr. W. J. Rolfe, the well-known Shakespearean 
scholar, recently celebrated his eightieth birthday by 
the completion of a new volume, entitled ^' Shakespeare 
Proverbs." The selection of proverbs, maxims, aphor- 
isms, and apothegms included in the forthcoming 
volume was originally made by Mrs. Cowden-Clarke, 
who selected from the plays only. Additional selections 
from the sonnets and other poems of Shakespeare have 
been made by Dr. Rolfe, who also contributes an intro- 
duction and notes. 

" John Chinaman at Home " (Scribners), the Rev. 
E. J. Hardy's lively sketches of " Men, Maimers, and 
Things in China," has recently attained the popularity 
of a third edition. As chaplain to the British forces at 
Hong Kong for three years, Mr. Hardy had rather 
unusual opportunities for observing Chinese ways; and 
he was thoroughly on the alert to utilize them. His 
account of what he saw, heard, and did in China is 
informal, direct, and thoroughly readable. The photo- 
graphic illustrations are excellent. 

Mr. Arthur Elson's " Music Club Programs from All 
Nations," published by the Oliver Ditson Co., is some- 
thing more of a book than its title would indicate. 
Although not a large one, it gives us, in addition to a 
great number of concert programmes, judiciously 
arranged to exhibit national traits in musical composi- 
tion, a number of sets of questions for class study, and 
a text which is a skeleton history and biographical dic- 
tionary of modern music. The illustrations are groups 
of portraits, and give us many modem faces that have 
not yet become familiar to music-lovers. 

The American Book Co. add to their " Gateway 
Series " a volume of " Selections from Irvmg's Sketch- 
Book," edited by Professor Martin W. Sampson; and 
" The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin," edited by 
the late Albert Henry Smyth. From the same publishers 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

we have a book on " The Short Story," edited by 
Professor Brander Matthews. The volume consists 
essentially of specimens illustrative of the development 
of this literary form beginning with the " Gesta Roman- 
orum "and Boccaccio, and coming down to living writers, 
three of whom are represented. The editor contributes 
some fifty pages of critical matter, which are highly 
interesting, both because they exhibit a man riding a 
hobby, and because they provide a sympathetic and 
penetrating study of the subject. 

Professor Lane Cooper has edited a work on "Theories 
of Style " that will be found highly useful by students 
and teachers of literature. A selection from Wacker- 
nagel on the general theory of style is placed in the 
forefront of the volume, and is followed by extracts from 
Plato, Aristotle, and Longinus, among the ancients, and 
from Swift, Buffon, Voltaire, Goethe, Coleridge, De 
Quincey, Thoreau, Schopenhauer, Spencer, Lewes, 
Stevenson, Pater, Brunetifere, and Mr. Frederic Har- 
rison, among the moderns. Tliere is a select bibliog- 
raphy, and the extracts are provided with notes, but not 
enough to swamp them. (Macmillau.) 

Several notable volumes of poetry and the drama are 
announced for spring pubhcation by the Macmillan Co. 
The promise of several hitherto unknown poems by 
Tennyson, as well as of a series of his own notes on his 
works, is perhaps of the greatest significance. Then 
there is a new volume of poems by Alfred Noyes, one 
of the most promising of the younger generation in 
England, and new dramas by Stephen Phillips and 
William Butler Yeats. Mr. Phillips has written a 
" Faust " v/hich is to be produced in London by Mr. 
Beerbohm Tree before the close of the present season. 
Mr. Yeats's new drama, " The Unicom from the Stars," 
which he wrote in collaboration with Lady Gregory, has 
already been played in Dublin, and will be published in 
a volume along with " Kathleen Ni Houlahan " and a 
revised edition of « The Hour Glass." The American 
drama is represented by Mr. Percy MacKaye, with 
" The Scarecrow," the first prose drama from his hand 
to be published. 

The death of Daniel CoUamore Heath, at Newtonville 
Mass., on January 29 last, removes from the American 
publishing fraternity one of its oldest and most respected 
members, and from American public life an earnest 
worker for civic and national betterment. Bom in 1843, 
Mr. Heath was prepared for college at the Nichols Latin 
School in Lewiston, Maine, and was graduated from 
Amherst College in the class of '68. For the next two 
years he was principal of the high school in Southboro, 
Mass., and then devoted two years to study at the 
Bangor Theological Seminary. Turning again to edu- 
cational affairs, after a year of travel abroad, he 
became supervisor of schools at Farmington, Maine. 
After serving in that capacity for a year he entered 
the book business, and in 1874 represented in 
Rochester, N. Y., the publishing firm of Ginn Brothers. 
A year later he opened a branch house for the firm in 
New York City, where he remained for some months. 
In 1876 he became a member of the firm, under the 
title of Ginn & Heath, Boston. This relation continued 
until 1886, when he disposed of his partnership interest 
and started in business on his own account in educational 
publishing as head of the well-known house of D. C. 
Heath & Company. In the cause of civil service reform 
Mr. Heath did much efficient service, and he was one of 
those who most earnestly deplored our national impe- 
rialistic exploits of the past few years.

JUST PUBLISHED 
THE MOST IMPORTANT BIOGRAPHY OF THE NEW YEAR 

Thomas Alva Edison 

SIXTY YEARS OF AN INVENTOR'S LIFE 
By FRANCIS ARTHUR JONES 

THIS volume will at once commend itself as one of the few necessary 
books to librarians and readers alike. Edison's name and fame 
are known around the world. His life story reads like a romance, 
from the time he published a newspaper on board a train at fourteen, 
and later was an out-at-the-elbows '* tramp " telegraph operator till his 
electrical inventions caused the formation of a fifteen million dollar 
stock company. 

No recent life of Edison is in print, a fact which makes this book 
doubly valuable. It is the result of close acquaintance with and study 
of the inventor, and is at once complete, authoritative, and intensely 
interesting. It is a romance of truth which far exceeds fiction.

THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC. 



What a puzzle music must be to those unfor- 
tunate people, stricken with spiritual cecity, to 
whom the art is no more than so much sound 
and fury, signifying nothing. They know that 
to others it constitutes a whole world of experi- 
ence, yet are themselves excluded from that 
world by an insuperable barrier. They must 
take it on faith, as the color-blind must take 
the rainbow and the sunset. If they are honest 
with themselves, they will admit and lament 
this defect of sense, accepting the unavoidable, 
gazing wistfully at the walls that separate them 
from a realm of whose glories they know from 
trustworthy report, but into which they may 
not enter. Sometimes they are not honest with 
themselves, averring the very existence of the 
realm to be a fable, and those who claim its 
franchise to be self -deluded, finding realities in 
what are but vain imaginings. They allow 
music to be sound, more or less agreeable, but 
they stoutly deny, although in the face of an 
overwhelming mass of testimony, that it has 
any spiritual meaning. Deaf themselves to 
aught beyond its direct impact upon the sense, 
they affect a skepticism of all hearing in others, 
save in their own narrow and literal interpre- 
tation of the term. 

This specialized form of philistinism is not 
uncommon, but it is rarely voiced with the frank 
defiance of an article that has recently come 
under our observation. In this case, the self- 
revelation is so naive., the ascription of the 
writer's limitations to the rest of mankind so 
absolute, that the instance seems worthy of 
mention, and may serve as a pretext for a little 
profitable analysis. Starting out with the 
question-begging assumption that music pro- 
vides " mere sensation," disqualifying its votaries 
for " intellectual and volitional achievements," 
the writer goes on to labor the point by such 
arguments as the following : "It is no more 
elevating to train the ear than the taste ; to 
enjoy sound than to enjoy flavor." " Enjoy- 
ing sound that goes into the ear is no more 
cultivating than enjoying lobsters that go into 
the stomach." " Listening to one of Beethoven's 
sonatas is not greatly different in kind from eat- 
ing a beefsteak." These precious propositions 



120 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



lead to the conclusion that music, being one "of 
our " surface pleasures," gets too much of our 
attention, and that "the substantials of life 
should have a larger place in civilization." 
These substantials are specified to be " science, 
philosophy, statesmanship, and practical enter- 
prise," and thus a petitio principii ends, as it 
began, the whole argument. 

Our attention happened to be called, just as 
we were occupied with this self-revelation of a 
partly-atrophied mind, to what Beethoven said 
of Napoleon after the battle of Jena. " What 
a pity that I am not acquainted with the science 
of war as I am with that of music. I woidd 
show myself his master." And who, knowing 
anything of the powerful personality that 
expressed itseK in the " Eroica," could seriously 
doubt that it was entirely capable of just the 
sort of " intellectual and volitional achievement " 
that our writer takes for granted as being beyond 
the reach of the musician. But this illustration 
is only by the way. What we are at present 
concerned with doing is to point out the inade- 
quacy of our writer's notion of " the substan- 
tials of life." It really narrows down to science 
and nothing else, for the moment any element 
not purely intellectual enters into the case, there 
comes with it the possibility of a musical rela- 
tionship. The province of music is the entire 
emotional and spiritual life, and the intellect, 
although a necessary philosophical concept, is no 
more to be caught by itself than those equally 
necessary abstractions, the perfect pendulum and 
the economic man. Science comes nearest to 
being pure when it takes the mathematical form, 
but we cannot forget Kepler's spiritual exalta- 
tion in contemplation of his laws of planetary 
motion, and we may also recall what Abt Vogler 
thought about the whole matter — 
"The rest may reason and welcome, 'tis we mvisicians 
know." 

What are "the substantials of life ? " Science 
is certainly one of them, but there are at least 
three others, art, ethics, and religion. And if 
we allow that the one is only here and there 
touched with emotion, the other three are surely 
suffused with it through and through. And the 
relation of music to all three of them as surely 
needs no argument in its proof. For music is 
itself an art, it is a potent influence upon char- 
acter, and it is of the very essence of religion. 
To refuse it artistic rank on the plea that it is 
no more than an ingenious arrangement of soiind 
is like saying that sculpture is no more than 
bronze or marble, that painting is no more than 
canvas and pigments. But being as much more 



than sound as poetry is more than words printed 
in black ink upon white paper, the character of 
music as an art is beyond cavil, and any liken- 
ing of its effect to that of food upon the palate 
is supremely ridiculous. There are many, 
indeed, who woidd go so far as to call it the 
highest of the arts, holding with Pater that every 
other art " constantly aspires towards the con- 
dition of music," which is " the true type or 
measure of perfected art." 

There is so much to say upon the subject of 
music as an ethical agency, as an influence upon 
conduct and character, that we hardly know 
where to begin. The few who would deny that 
influence have nothing more than their negative 
opinion to oppose to an overwhelming mass of 
positive testimony. The number of people who, 
interrogating their own consciousness, are pre- 
pared to assert that music has been a power for 
good in their lives, offers a crushing refutation 
to the skeptic, who in his very statement of 
denial puts himself in the class of the defectives. 
If a man declares that he has been stimulated 
by the masterpieces of Bach and Beethoven to 
worthier endeavor and a more strenuous pur- 
pose, that his better nature has been awakened, 
his altruism broadened, and his wiU strength- 
ened, by communion with the great tone-artists, 
he would be a rash person indeed who should 
gainsay that evidence, or pronounce it to be 
self-delusion. A man generally knows what 
elements have counted in his own spiritual up- 
building, and has a fair notion of the extent to 
which they have reacted upon his dealings with 
his fellow-men; it would be the height of im- 
pudence for one of those fellow-men to inform 
him that he was entirely mistaken, and that 
what he knew by the immediate testimony of 
consciousness to have been a directive force in 
his life had really been nothing of the sort, but 
only an ineffectual titillation of the sense of 
hearing. When argument runs counter to intui- 
tion, it is not the latter that suffers rout. 

We are not now particularly concerned with 
such matters as the influence of march and 
dance rhythms upon the sensitive mind, or even 
with the heightening of energy that results from 
the stimulus of martial music. These are mat- 
ters that hang only upon the outskirts of our 
central theme, and that have but little bearing 
upon its elucidation. The true influence of 
music upon character and conduct strikes far 
deeper than this, and is not illustrated in any 
typical fashion by " Blue Danube " and 
" Racoc'zy " and " Marseillaise " examples. It 
is a subtle and profoxmd influence, working at

THE DIAL 



121 



the very roots of the soul's growth, and building 
up from below and within the structure of our 
higher spiritual life. If we are to take illustra- 
tive examples at all, we should seek them in such 
works as the " Tannhauser " and " Parsifal " 
overtures, the C Major Symphony of Schubert 
and the C Minor Symphony of Beethoven. As 
compared with the uplifting potency of such 
works as these, the most consecrated prescriptive 
moralizing seems feeble, the most pithy ethical 
precept seems indirect. 

K the philosophers are right when they urge 
that sympathy is the foundation of the moral 
life, what more remains to be said in behalf of 
music as an effective influence upon conduct? 
Much more might be said in detail, but every 
instance adduced would lead us back to that 
basic principle. The great composer, beyond 
any other artist, takes us into his intimacy, 
imparts to us the contagion of his spirit, and 
permits us to share in his own most exalted 
moods. His tenderness, his indignation, his 
brooding griefs, his ecstatic raptures, his all- 
embracing love become ours also. And while 
we are under his speU our petty personalities 
are merged in his larger nature, our vexing 
ripples are lost in the sweep of his emotional 
tides. Yet it is not so much the effacement of 
personality that we attain to as the sense of 
enlargement, of a new light which reveals our 
private perplexity as but part of a harmonious 
scheme of things entire, and which makes us 
exclaim in wonder at the penetrative sympathy 
that can thus reach into the inmost soul, noting 
each 

" Separate wave, and to what sea 
Its difficult eddies labour in the ground." 

Surely it cannot be urged with any show of 
reason that these moments, fleeting though they 
be, in which we live a richer and more generous 
life than is normally ours, pass away and leave 
no permanent mark upon us. 

Music is no drowsy syrup lulling us into 
forgetfulness, but rather a source of renewed 
strength and greater fortitude to bear the bur- 
dens of our lot. Tranquillizing though it may 
seem, and conducive to the passive attitude, it 
is all the time stirring hidden springs of activity 
within us, and the extent to which we thus react 
is the true measure of its power. Its ministry 
may be that of an anodyne for sorrow, but it is 
also far more, for it performs the Aristotelian 
function of katharsis no less effectively than 
does the art of the poet. Tschaikowsky's 
*' Pathetic Symphony " is a work of the same 
order of magnitude as Shakespeare's " Othello," 



and exerts the same sort of influence ; for the 
one work, like the other, purges the soul of 
terror and pity by bringing it to contemplate 
those emotions in an ideal embodiment and 
under the species of eternity. And the " sud- 
den music of pure peace " that sealed the three- 
fold song of Dante's vision seals also the St. 
Matthew Passion of Bach, and the Choral 
Symphony of Beethoven, and the closing rap- 
tures of " Tristan und Isolde " and the " Gotter- 
dammerung," for to the spiritual eye the visions 
thus vouchsafed are revelations no less divine 
than that of the Rose of Paradise. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



French journalistic enterprise lags so far behind 
American that the editor-in-chief of Le Matin, M. 
Stephane Lauzanne, has come to this country to study 
our newspaper methods with a view to waking up his 
own newspaper a little earlier in the morning — 
although he does not thus paronomastically express his 
purpose. The French daily, printed to-day, dated 
to-morrow, and giving the news of yesterday, is cer- 
tainly less wide-awake than the sheet in which, upon 
M. Lauzanne's arrival at his hotel in New York, he was 
astonished to behold his own photograph, the report of 
an interview with him "down the harbor," and an 
account of his first impressions of America. " How you 
do that is just what I have come here to find out," he 
explained. " In the offices of Le Matin I think we have 
all the machinery you have in newspaper offices in 
America. We have linotypes; we have big American 
rotary presses; it is the rapidity of doing things that we 
have not yet acquired. We have what I should call the 
outillage, but we must have the oil to put in it to make 
it go quickly." He said further: " In Paris we have a 
big staff of reporters, but French reporters are apt to 
talk much, and discussions take a long time." He 
expressed amazement at the activity of our people, noted 
their unhesitating directness of purpose, and commented 
admiringly on the brightness of our skies and our free- 
dom from smoke and fog. " New York people seem 
much livelier than Londoners," he declared. " Dullness 
and Americans do not seem to go together." This last 
reminds one of the late Dean Hole's perplexed surprise 
at finding the sharpest people in the world using the 
dullest knives at table. Time is too precious with us 
to be employed in scouring steel cutlery. It is to be 
hoped that in our French visitor's proposed two months' 
study of American journalism, he will let the yellow 
variety serve as a warning, not as an example.

The crowded life of the literary workman is 
not the existence of ease, the idle and luxurious inviting 
of one's soul, that some have imagined it. That admir- 
able man of letters and ornament of London journalism, 
William Clarke, a selection of whose writings is reported 
to have been recently issued, had no korce subsecivce in 
his working day. The following extract from a letter 
to his mother gives a glimpse of a life that was even too 
busy, too little meditative and deliberate, for the best 
results. " My mode of life," he confesses, " does not

suit me ; but, then, what can I do ? I will tell you how 
I spent yesterday, as a sample. Read papers half an 
hour after breakfast; then wrote notes for the Chronicle, 
then a long review of the new ten-volume ' Life of Lin- 
coln ' for the Chronicle, filling thirteen MSS. pages. I 
was in the mood for it, and wrote till about 3 p. m. Then 
rushed out and snatched a roll and cup of cofPee, the 
first morsel I had eaten since breakfast. Then train 
to Charing Cross to keep an appointment at 4.30, after 
which I glanced at the club at the evenmg papers, and 
wrote another Chronicle note. Then dined at the club, 
and rushed off to the Chronicle office, where I worked 
from eight to eleven doing half a column on Christmas 
cards, three notes, and two leaders, one of which was on 
a book I had to look through. I left the office when 
the clock was striking eleven. I did not get any sleep 
till nearly three in the morning, and was awakened 
before eight. I don't suppose one of the five millions 
in London did more work than I did yesterday. I know 
I shall not be able to keep it up." One would think not. 
The wonder is that, with these scrambling methods, he 
earned the reputation of having helped to make journal- 
ism literature. . , , 

The universities and the magazines are made 
the subject of a half-playf id comparison in the course of 
Dr. William James's recent article on "The Social 
Value of the College-Bred." After declaring that the 
best single phrase to express the purpose of the higher 
education is tliat " it shoiild enable us to know a good 
man when we see him " — the word "good " being used 
in its broadest sense — the writer takes occasion to add: 
" In our essential function of indicating the better men, 
we now have formidable competitors outside [the col- 
leges and universities]." A number of these competi- 
tors, wide-awak e American periodicals, are then named, 
after which comes this suggestive passage : " It would 
be a pity if any future historian were to have to write 
words like these : * By the middle of the twentieth cen- 
tury the higher institutions of learning had lost all 
influence over public opinion in the United States. But 
the mission of raising the tone of democracy, which they 
had proved themselves so lamentably unfitted to exert, 
was assumed with rare enthusiam and prosecuted with 
extraordinary skill and success by a new educational 
power; and for the claiification of their human sympa- 
thies and elevation of their human preferences, the 
people at large acquired the habit of resorting exclu- 
sively to the guidance of certain private literary adven- 
tures, commonly designated in the market by the 
affectionate name of ten-cent magazines.' " The public 
library has long been regarded as the people's imiversity ; 
is it possible that the monthly magazine will ever qualify 
itself, or is even now beginning to qualify itself, seriously 
to dispute with the library the right to that title? 
Stranger things have happened. 

How PUBLIC LIBRARY FUNDS ARE SPENT is a ques- 
tion touching the public pocket and havmg a general 
interest. The Secretary of the American Library Asso- 
ciation has brought this matter to the attention of the 
United States Commissioner of Education by recom- 
mending that in the next government report on public 
libraries there be included in the statistical tables figures 
showing what proportion of each library's expenditure 
is devoted to (a) books, periodicals, and binding, (b) 
salaries, and (c) other purposes. It is also urged that 
there be added to the report a digest of the library laws 



of the several states, this information being at present of 
a scattered and not easily obtainable sort, but especially 
necessary to those engaged in the work of library exten- 
sion. Finally, request is made that, in view of the rapid 
development of state, county, city, and proprietary travel- 
ling library systems, a separate statistical table be given, 
showing date of formation, headquarters, source of sup- 
port, annual expenditure, number of books, circulation, 
etc., of all such library systems throughout the country. 
Serious consideration of these and any other similar 
suggestions is promised by the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion. Of much practical value would it be to have at 
hand figures and other information tending to show just 
what apportionment of a library's income is likely to 
insure a maximum of usefidness, although no hard and 
fast rule could be laid down for all times and all places.

The idealist in practical affairs is not always 
so comically helpless as the traditional German pro- 
fessor confronted with the commonplace reahties of 
daily life. Indeed, one likes to believe, and not seldom 
sees convincing reason to believe, with Plato, that only 
the man of pure and liigh ideals is truly wise and 
efficient in the ordering of the humble but necessary 
details of mundane existence. The pursuit of literature 
and a participation in practical polities have often been 
proved to be not incompatible. The many instances in 
modern times of English and French statesmen who have 
also been distinguished as authors, need not here be 
cited. Coming nearer home, we find some recent and 
interesting examples of the man of letters combined 
with the political reformer. The poet-mayor of San 
Francisco has won national fame for himself; Mr. 
Winston Churchill attracted much attention by fighting 
corrupt railroad influence in New Hampshire; Mr. 
Booth Tarkington tore himself from the charms of 
romance-writing to represent his district in the Indiana 
legislature; and now Mr. Owen Wister, moved with a 
laudable desire to purify the political atmosphere of that 
Sodom of mimicipal corruption that claims him as a 
citizen, offers himself as candidate for the upper cham- 
ber of the city's legislative body. It is an Augean 
stable that waits to be cleaned, but Mr. Wister is young 
and vigorous, both in mind and body. 

Coins that will always pass current, in liter- 
ature if not in the market, are those obsolescent pieces, 
dear to readers of romance and poetry and drama, — the 
pistole, the noble, the ducat (" My daughter ! O my 
ducats ! O my daughter ! O my Christian ducats ! ") the 
groschen, the piece of eight, and many others. We have 
but the vaguest notion of the value of any of these 
coins when we meet with them in oxu- literary wander- 
ings, and therein lies lialf their charm : they lend them- 
selves so beautifully to the pui-poses of the imagination, 
they convey so little suggestion of real cash, of " filthy 
lucre," and yet their pm-chasing power is so splendidly 
unlimited. Into this treasury of untainted money has 
recently passed the historic German thaler : on the 
first of October it ceased to be recognized as a coin of 
the Empire, and henceforth its currency is limited, 
or rather extended, to the larger empire of letters. 
Joachimsthal and the coin there first minted (in 1484) 
will not soon pass into oblivion, and if we do forget 
that the thaler is equivalent to three marks, all the 
more serviceable will it become for purposes of poetry 
and fiction.

Peter the Great as library-founder is far less 
prominent in history and in the public mind than Peter 
the ship-builder, or Peter the founder of Russia's present 
capital, or Peter the masterful, though on the whole 
benevolent, despot and empire-builder. The Imperial 
Library at St. Petersburg, established by him in 1714, 
competes with our own national library at Washington 
for third place among the world's great libraries, both 
collections of books numbering nearly a million and a 
half. The Bibhoth^que Nationale and the library of the 
British Museum are larger. The most noteworthy 
addition ever made to the St. Petersburg library 
occurred at the time of the suppression of the Jesuits 
in Russia, when there was a general transference of 
Jesuit libraries to the Imperial Library, including the 
famous collection of Count Zaluski, which was said to 
contain 260,000 volumes and 10,000 manuscripts. As 
is well known, the most valuable possession of the 
St. Petersburg library is the Codex Sinaiticus, or man- 
uscript of the Bible in Greek uncials, discovered by 
Tischendorf in 1859 in the convent on Mt. Sinai. 

The psychology of journalistic appeal engages 
the attention of Professor Walter D. Scott, director of 
the psychological laboratory at Northwestern University. 
He is collecting data, and the publication of the result 
of his researches is awaited with interest. Hundreds of 
cii-culars have been sent out, asking what dailies the 
recipients read, and the reason for their choice. Other 
inquiries relate to the different departments of the 
newspaper that especially appeal to each reader, the 
amount of time given to newspaper reading, the induce- 
ments that have led to the taking of one journal rather 
than another, and so on. What domain will not the 
psychologist (of the Miinsterbergian school) soon enter ? 
But if a cure for yellow journalism can be found, the 
invader in this field at least is cordially welcome. The 
first step toward such a remedy, the investigation of 
the causes of the evil, is apparently being taken by 
Professor Scott. Will he afterward be able, in his 
psychological laboratory, to compound a medicine that 
will cure the disease ?

The Hispanic Society's library and museum 
were opened to the public a few weeks ago. This society, 
organized and endowed by Mr. Archer M. Huntington, 
a lifelong student of Spanish art, literature, and history, 
has a limited membership of one hundred, and each 
member must be a specialist in some department of 
research allied to the general purposes of the society. 
The library contains nearly 50,000 volumes in various 
languages and relating chiefly to Spanish history and 
literature ; while the museum is stocked with curiosities 
illustrating the arts and crafts of the Spaniards. Here 
are to be seen gold coins of the Moorish kings and speci- 
mens of Hispano-Mauresque lustre-ware in finer and 
more abundant display than can be found elsewhere, 
except in a few European museums. The " Revue 
Hispanique," a quarterly valuable to students of Spanish 
subjects, is published in Paris by the Hispanic Society. 
The work of this organization not only promotes the 
cause of culture, but tends to knit closer the ties con- 
necting us with the republics toward the south.

Inter- bibliothecal courtesies tend to multiply 
the usefulness of libraries as well as to promote good- 
fellowship among them. Without exactly wishing to 
see our public libraries " syndicated " after the scheme 



proposed a while ago by Librarian Canfield of Columbia 
University and commented on in these columns, one can 
rejoice in the good accomplished by the clearing-house 
methods so intelligently and energetically followed by 
Mr. Putnam at Washington. " Insensibly and without 
special advertising," he says, " the Library of Congress 
is, through its system of exchanges, not merely strength- 
ening its own resources, but becoming in a measure a 
sort of clearing-house for other American libraries. It 
cannot undertake to become so completely, since it has 
neither the space to accommodate the pending material 
nor the free service with which to handle it ; but within 
its space and means it has no scruple in utilizing its own 
duplicates to strengthen well-administered libraries else- 
where." Increased facilities for this work are certainly 
to be desired. ... 

The per capita supply of public library books, 
which used to be greater in Boston than anywhere else, 
now reaches its maximum in Springfield, if recently 
published statistics are to be trusted. That the honor 
of thus most generously providing for the citizen's intel- 
lectual needs still remains in Massachusetts, is not a 
surprising revelation, nor, to some of us, an altogether 
displeasing one. In the matter of open-handed financial 
support of her public library, the city of the three hills 
still holds the supremacy, as shown by tax receipts, city 
census, and library appropriation. The Bostonian, it 
appears, pays fifty-four cents a year for his mestimable 
library privileges, while (pro pudor!) the Jersey Citizen 
spares but a reluctant twelve cents, and the dweller 
in Providence even cuts under that by paying only one 
cent over a dime for his public library reading. The 
best things in life are often the cheapest; but not even 
books, which are among the very best, can be had for 
nothing. It is an unwise Providence that scrimps and 
pares in its public library expenditure. 

Hawthorne and the critics seem to be not on the 
best of terms in these days. Is this assaidt on the wizard 
of Salem simply a natural reaction from the centenary 
enthusiasm of a few years ago, or have we, in our delight 
in his " airy and charming insubstantiality," been indulg- 
ing a foolish joy and revelling im worthily in a silly 
paradise ? Have we, as Mr. Brownell and others now 
seem bent on making us believe, been wrong in rejoicing 
with Mr. Henry James that Hawthorne's "beautiful, 
light imagination is the wing that on the autumn evening 
just brushes the dusky window " ? Thinness, airiness, 
and insubstantiality are sometimes beautiful and wholly 
desirable qualities — in angels, for instance. Bulkiness 
and beefiness do not embody all virtues. It was long 
ago pointed out that the cheapest sort of criticism is 
that which finds fault with an author for not being 
something other than he is ; and this, when the case 
against Hawthorne is reduced to its lowest terms, is 

about all that remains.

Next summer's conference of librarians, as 
now definitely announced by the executive committee of 
the American Library Association, will be held at Lake 
Minnetonka, Minn., Jime 26 — July 3. Among topics 
for discussion that are to receive especial attention are 
" Losses of Books from Open Shelves " — a subject 
touched upon several times in these columns — and 
" Books of the Year." The open-shelf question, says the 
committee, gives promise of an interesting debate, and 
advocates of this system, which has caused so much 
reactionary criticism of late, will doubtless be put on

their defense. In the second topic, exactly what books 
shall prove, some decades hence, to have been the " books 
of the year," not even expert custodians and circulators 
of literature can tell us ; but an expression of opinion 
from them may help to perpetuate the best books, and 
can certainly do no harm.

The revivification of a great public library, 

whose usefulness had not been so great as was very 
easily possible, is a pleasant thing to note. The Troy 
Public Library, under a new administration and reorgan- 
ization, has in the last three years nearly trebled its 
circulation without adding materially to its equipment 
or greatly increasing its annual expenditure. With a 
handsome building centrally situated, and a good-sized 
collection of books for general circulation, besides 
possessing means for reasonably rapid additions, the 
institution should have made a better showing than was 
revealed in the report of three years ago. That the 
powers in control thought so also, is made evident by 
the contrast between that report and the one for the 
year just closed. Brains will tell, in affairs of public 
service no less than in private business enterprise.

An anthology of history that promises to be 
vastly more than a mere florilege or garland — rather a 
whole garden or meadow of posies — is announced for 
early publication by the London " Times," and is to fill 
twenty-five volumes of about seventeen thousand pages 
in the aggregate. It will be a history of the world, 
composed of choice extracts from all the great historians. 
Think how Charles Lamb would have delighted to read 
through this encyclopaedic work from page one to page 
seventeen thousand ! Is there anything that more 
unmistakably distinguishes the mere book-buyer from 
the book-reader and book-lover than the presence in his 
library of these scissors-and-paste monstrosities masque- 
rading as books ? 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



SOME BOSTON CONTEMPORARIES OF 
EARL PERCY. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The review of " Earl Percy's Dinner-Table," in The 
Dial for February 1, sent me to the top shelves of my 
father's library, whereon stands a long row of boimd 
volumes of old Philadelphia magazines, which once 
belonged to the grandmother who died long before my 
day, and which were among the joys of my childhood. 
" Atkinson's Casket," " Grahame's Magazine," " Sar- 
tain's Magazine," " Godey's Lady's Book," — the well- 
cared-for old books, with their wealth of steel plates 
and mezzotints, and their discreet concession to worldly 
things in the delicate and high-bred fashion plates which 
are such a contrast to those of our own time, — they 
stand in proud consciousness that it was theirs to ofPer 
many of the classics of our literature and to boast many 
a name the world will not willingly let die. 

Instinct led me to " Grahame's Magazine " for 1842, 
and haste made me turn to its Index. Two criticisms, 
two stories, one poem by Poe ; " The Goblet of Life " 
and " The Spanish Student," by Longfellow; five poems 
by Lowell; four sonnets by Elizabeth B. Barrett; and. 



among lesser things, that which I sought — " The 
Daughters of Dr. Byles," by Miss Eliza Leslie, an ex- 
ceedingly sprightly and clever story-writer, now, alas ! 
forgotten as such, and remembered only by her 
" Seventy-Five Receipts," an ancient copy of which 
holds an honored place in my own pantry. 

Miss Leslie's visits to these Colonial Dames of Boston 
were described at such length as to furnish two papers 
for " Grahame's." I wish it were possible to reproduce 
every word of the story, for which the overworked word 
"quaint " must serve ; and I am conscious that in shorten- 
ing it to the small space that is all I dare ask for in 
The Dial, I am leaving out much that would be dear 
to all who, like myself, love old days and old ways and 
old ladies. 

Miss Mary and Miss Catherine Byles — or, to use 
Miss Leslie's collective noim, the Miss Byleses — were 
born in Boston, as was their father, the Rev. Dr. Mather 
Byles, who first saw the light in 1706. Of the Brah- 
minical race of Cotton Mather, it was almost a matter 
of course that he went to England to be educated at 
Cambridge and that after his ordination he returned 
to Boston. Here he became the first rector of Hollis 
Street Church, married a daughter of Governor Taylor, 
and bought a piece of ground at the junction of Tremont 
and Nassau Streets, with a house hideous in its unpainted 
ugliness but surrounded by magnificent horse-chestnut 
trees. He enjoyed much reputation for learning, cor- 
responded with Alexander Pope and Dr. Watts, and 
held a highly enviable place in society. 

Unfortunately for him, a series of disagreements 
which he was never able to comprehend arose between 
New England and the mother coimtry. His sympathies 
were with England; and in the unquiet days there was 
nothing for him to do but to resign his office, since pray- 
ing for the King was intolerable to his parishioners, and 
pray for the King he would. His houSe was head- 
quarters for the British officers, and his daughters were 
fond of relating how they "walked on the Common 
arm-in-arm with General Howe and Lord Percy, both 
of whom were frequent visitors at the house, and often 
took tea and spent the evening there." 

" I imagined the heir of Northumberland taking his 
tea in the old parlor, at the old tea-table, — entertained 
by the witticisms of Dr. Byles and the prettiness of his 
daughters, who, of course, were the envy of those who 
could not aspire to be talked to by English noblemen. 
Moreover, Lord Percy frequently ordered the band of 
his regiment to play under the chestnut trees for the 
gratification of the Miss Byleses who then, as they said, 
had ' God Save the King ' in perfection." 

It was about this time that the doctor was " walking 
one day with a Whig gentleman in the vicinity of the 
Common where a division of the British lay encamped. 
His companion, pointing to the soldiers of the Crown, 
said, ' You see the cause of all our evils.' ' But you 
cannot say that our evils are not red-dressed,^ remarked 
Dr. Byles. ' Your pun is not a good one,' observed his 
companion; 'you have misspelt the word by adding 
another D.' 'Well,' replied the clerical joker, 'as a 
doctor of divinity, am I not entitled to the use of 
two D's ? ' " 

Later he was sentenced to banishment, and his goods 
to confiscation; but out of respect for his character the 
Board of War remitted the sentence as far as his worldly 
goods were concerned, and lessened the personal penalty 
to confinement in his own house. Once he asked the 
sentinel to fetch a bucket of water, as the day was warm 



1908.]

and the prisoner thirsty. The soldier declined to quit 
his post before relief came, but the doctor overcame his 
scruples by offering to guard himself until the soldier's 
return. " The sentinel at last complied," says Miss 
Leslie, " and took the bucket and went to the pump, 
first resigning his musket to Dr. Byles, who shouldered 
it in a very soldier-like manner, and paced the porch, 
guarding himself until the sentry came back, to whom 
on returning his piece he said, * Now, my friend, 
you see I have been guarded, reguarded, and disre- 
guarded.' " 

" The Miss Byleses told me much of the scarcity of 
provisions and firewood throughout Boston during the 
winter of 1775, when the British and their adherents 
held out the town against the Yankee rebels, as they 
called them. It was then that the old North Church was 
torn down by order of General Howe that the sol- 
diers might convert into fuel the wood of which it was 
built." 

Dr. Byles lived a very secluded life until his death 
in 1788. The younger of his daughters lived until 1837, 
when she was laid beside him under the pavement of 
the chancel of Trinity Church. For many years the 
sisters sequestered themselves in the old house, which 
held one glorious treasure in the portrait of Dr. Byles 
by Copley. They owned great stores of ancient plate, 
which they would never use or part with, and in spite of 
the increasing value of their little patrimony they lived 
in a poverty which would have been destitution but for 
the bounty of some friends whose kindness they never 
acknowledged by visits, since they left their home only 
to go to service at Trinity, and then always heavily veiled. 
They liked receiving visits, however, and took pleasure 
in some very childish mysteries which they performed, 
as well as in showing their father's portrait, and his 
papers — some bearing the signatures of Queen Anne, 
and of the three Georges to whom he had owed alle- 
giance. Apparently in their world everything had 
stopped in '83, and they lived on and on into extreme 
old age, absorbed in the recollection of their brilliant 
youth, when they "walked arm in arm with General 
Howe and Lord Percy on Boston Common."

AN ALLEGED PROTOTYPE OF GOLDSMITH'S 

•' VICAR." 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I stumbled into a literary pitfall .the other day, and 
1 ought to have known better ! Lest anyone else should 
be equally foolish, or unfortunate, I hereby make public 
confession. 

In my life of John Newbery I told the true story of 
the sale of the manuscript of " The Vicar of Wakefield " 
— which had been so garbled by Boswell on account of 
his desire to extol his hero. Dr. Johnson, at the expense 
of every one of his entourage, poor " Goldy " included, — 
and I thought I had made myself familiar with all that 
was to be known about the writing and the publication 
of the ever-famous " Vicar " and " the philanthropic 
publisher of Saint Paul's Churchyard" whose seat I 
inherited and sat in for so many years. 

A month or more ago, while digging and delving 
in those old-fashioned annuals so popular here and in 
England in the middle of the last century, I happened 
upon " The Moss Rose," edited by A. A. Phillips and 
published in New York in 1848, where I found a story 



by Tschokke (Zschokke?) entitled "Leaves from the 
Journal of a poor Vicar " with this note prefixed : 

" Translated from the German of Tschokke ; he intimates 
that it is taken from the English and that it probably gave 
Oliver Goldsmith the first hint towards the ' Vicar of Wake- 
field.' If originally English it is not easy to understand why 
it was allowed to die." 

The Journal begins Dec. 15, 1764, and ends Jan. 16, 
1765. Its whole conception, tone, and flavor at once 
recall "The Vicar "; but the incidents, though suggestive 
of the Goldsmith story, differ. It really reads, however, 
as though it might have been an ebauche for the "Vicar." 
So I wrote to my old friend, Austin Dobson, the 
greatest living authority on eighteenth century English 
literature, especially on Goldsmith and his time, asking 
him what he knew about it. Here is his reply: 

" 75 Eaton Rise, Ealing, W. 

,r ^ ^ 8: ii: '08. 

" My Dear Welsh : 

" This * Journal of a poor Vicar ' is always taming up as 
the germ of Goldsmith's book tho' it was fully disposed of 
by W. J. Thorns in Notes and Queries as far back as Feb. 
26 1857 (2nd Series No 61). It appears first in the Decem- 
ber No. of The British Magazine for 1766, some months 
after the publication of The Vicar in the previous March. 
Thorns says it also appeared in The Gentleman^s Magazine 
for Jan. 1767 and The Gentleman's Magazine of 1849, which 
again reprinted it from the Boston Chronicle of 1766 — the 
Chronicle having found it in The British Magazine. I don't 
think it has any connection with Goldsmith. The Vicar, as 
you know, was thought of as early as 1762. With kind 
regards, yours sincerely, Austin Dobson." 

This reference to 1762 alludes to the entry in the 
account books of Benjamin Collins of Salisbury, who, 
with Newbery, bought a one-third share of " The Vicar 
of Wakefield " " from the author. Dr. Goldsmith, Octo- 
ber 28, 1762 for £21," — which was for the first time 
brought to light on p. 61 of " A Bookseller of the Last 

C«"*"^y-" Charles Welsh.

"GAWMING" OR "GORMING." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
In commenting, in your last issue, on Colonel 
Higginson's article, "The Migration of Words," you 
quote him as saying that " only in Marblehead, on our 
coast, could be heard the uncouth word 'gawming' 
(awkward, lubberly) which Grose's dictionary contains 
as a North of England term." It strikes me that the 
Colonel is not strictly accurate in this assertion, for I 
recall that in my boyhood in the Connecticut valley of 
Massachusetts the word was in frequent use, and per- 
haps is to this day. I have never written or seen it 
written, and I confess that I had supposed it was 
spelled " gorming." It is a word that I have frequently 
used, however, as I learned to use it, in the sense of 
" gorming about " — that is to say, looking about in a 
clownish and aimless manner. I dare say there are not 
a few Yankees, or descendants of Yankees, in Chicago 
who will recall this word as a not infrequent feature of 
everyday speech. 

" What did you do down at Springfield ? " 
" Oh, I kind o' gormed about." 

This was a natural and perfectly intelligible way of 
describing a villager's visit to the city.

" The Wizard of M enlo Park." * 

Mr. Edison is no longer " the Wizard of 
Menlo Park," but rather the Indefatigable 
Inventor of Orange, where his laboratories are 
now situated, and the much visited and inter- 
viewed resident of Llewellyn Park, the hand- 
some quarter of the town where he lives. But 
as he has so many thousand more important 
things to do than to talk to newspaper men, he is 
far from being a thoroughly satisfactory subject 
to the interviewing reporter, who has often been 
forced either to draw largely on his own imagina^ 
tion in writing up his " story," or to return to the 
printing office empty-handed. Hence the multi- 
tude of fables, more or less marvellous and amus- 
ing, that have for years enlivened the pages of 
the daily press under the pretense of giving infor- 
mation concerning the great inventor. 

To correct some of these false reports, and to 
give an authentic sketch of Mr. Edison's life 
and achievements, Mr. Francis Arthur Jones 
has written a highly readable and pleasantly 
instructive book, " Thomas Alva Edison : Sixty 
Years of an Inventor's Life." It is, explains 
the author, "in no sense an exhaustive ' Life ' 
of Edison, and, indeed, could not be, seeing that 
the inventor is still young in heart and enthus- 
iasm, and that there are probably many years 
of his brilliant career still to run. His grand- 
father and great-grandfather lived to be cente- 
narians, and their noted descendant gives every 
indication of coming into healthy competition 
with them in the matter of a long life." 

The little town of Milan, Ohio, is Mr. 
Edison's birthplace, and it is almost exactly 
sixty-one years ago that he was born — of good 
parentage, in a well-to-do condition of life. The 
father had come to Milan from Canada, where 
he had incurred the displeasure of the Dominion 
government by taking too active a part in the 
Papineau Rebellion. An allotment of the 
public land which he had received was forfeited, 
and Samuel Edison took a hurried leave of his 
home and made his way to the American side 
of the St. Clair River. It is worth noting, in 
connection with the son's extraordinary powers 
of continuous work, that the father, in his flight 
from Canada, walked one hundred and eighty 
miles without sleep. One would gladly learn 
.more than is told of this hardy and energetic 
man ; but beyond the fact that he first settled

at Milan, and later removed to Port Huron, 
Michigan, where he " busied himself in various 
enterprises " and tried, with little success, to be 
a stern disciplinarian toward his son, he plays 
an imimportant part in Mr. Jones's book. The 
mother, also a Canadian, appears to have been 
a woman of strong and refined character, and 
her influence over her gifted son was powerfid 
and lasting. She had been a school-teacher in 
Nova Scotia, and, as the son himself long after- 
ward declared, her experience in the school- 
room had taught her many things about human 
nature, and especially about boys. She was a 
fine reader, and used to read aloud to her hus- 
band and children, in " a soft, clear, and finely 
modulated voice." At the age of nine, " Al," 
as she called him, had read, or his mother 
had read to him, " The Penny Encyclopaedia," 
Hume's " England," Gibbon's " Rome," Sears's 
" History of the World," and several works on 
subjects of wonderful fascination to him even 
thus early, — electricity and other branches of 
science. That was certainly a good beginning, 
and as he had an excellent memory his reading 
sooner or later proved its value. 

Those early crowded years of newspaper- 
selling (and newspaper-printing, too) on the 
Grand Trunk Railway, of chemical and electri- 
cal experiments, of work as telegrapher at various 
places in rapid succession — for, though an 
expert operator, his scientific experiments en- 
grossed so much of his attention that discharge 
followed hot on the heels of every engagement — 
all this has long been fairly familiar to a public 
curious about the smallest detail of the famous 
inventor's history. Not everyone, however, 
knows that in Mr. Edison's choice of science 
rather than letters for his life-work, journalism 
lost a great editor. " The Weekly Herald," 
which was edited, printed, and sold by the 
fifteen-year-old newsboy in connection with his 
general newspaper and candy trade on the train, 
was a rather remarkable sheet. Only one copy 
is now known to be extant, and a facsimile of 
one of its two small pages is given in the book. 
We are told that the' English engineer Stephen- 
son, who chanced to travel one day on the Port 
Huron and Detroit train, was so impressed with 
this little journal that he ordered a thousand 
copies ; and that " even the London Times 
expressed interest in the paper, and unbent 
sufficiently to quote from its columns." 

Fortune is ever on the alert to serve him who 
is worthy of her favors. After a variety of 
experiences young Edison was one morning 
walking along lower Broadway, wondering

whether the time would ever come when he could 
devote himself heart and soul to his germinat- 
ing schemes of invention, when the way was 
suddenly opened to him toward that desired 
end. Entering the office of the Law Gold 
Indicator, in Wall Street, he found trouble and 
confusion prevailing because something had 
gone wrong with the " tickers," and brokers were 
despatching frantic messages to headquarters to 
find out what was the matter. 

" Mr. Law was in the office, together with a small 
army of workmen, but no one seemed capable of locat- 
ing the trouble. Then Edison, who was standing by and 
seemed mildly interested in the commotion, remarked 
that he thought he could put things to rights, and Mr. 
Law told him to go ahead and see what he could do. 
Whereupon the young man quietly but deliberately 
removed a loose contact spring which had fallen between 
the wheels and immediately the instruments worked as 
chirpily as before. The repairers looked foolish and 
Mr. Law requested Edison to step into his office. After 
asking him a few questions, Mr. Law offered him the 
position of manager of the service at a salary of three 
hundred dollars a month. Edison says he nearly fainted 
when told what his remuneration was to be, but some- 
how he managed to keep a straight face and accepted 
the position with becoming gravity. Now that he had 
an assured income of thirty-six hundred dollars a year, 
Edison immediately opened a workshop 'down town,' 
and every moment that he could spare was devoted to 
his beloved experimenting." 

Another seeming accident, which led to still 
more important results, and which illustrates Mr. 
Edison's quickness to take a hint from whatever 
source, occurred in connection with the invention 
of the incandescent electric light. A suitable fila- 
ment for the lamp had long been sought in vain. 

" The inventor was seated in his laboratory alone one 
evening, a little serious over his thousand-and-one dis- 
appointments, though by no means crushed in spirit, and, 
as usual, thinking deeply, when his right hand, which 
lay idly upon the table, strayed towards a little pile of 
lampblack mixed with tar which his assistants had been 
using in connection with his telephone transmitter. Pick- 
ing up a modicum of this substance he began rolling it 
between his finger and thumb, still wondering what one 
thing he had forgotten which should make the electric 
light possible, and little dreaming that it lay between 
his fingers. For perhaps half an hour he continued to 
ponder and at the same time to roll the mixture, until 
at last he had obtained a thin thread not unlike a piece 
of wire in appearance. He looked at it idly, and then 
began to speculate on its possibilities as a filament for 
an incandescent lamp. It was carbon, of course, and, 
this being so, might have strength to withstand the 
electric current to a greater degree than platinum itself. 
He determined to put it to the test, and at once began 
the work of rolling out fine threads of the black com- 
position preparatory to placing them in the lamps." 

This experiment, though not wholly satisfactory, 
convinced the experimenter that he was at last 
on the right road. After further search and 
study, bamboo fibres were found to make the 



best filaments ; and then began a quest for speci- 
mens of all the twelve hundred known varieties 
of bamboo in all parts of the bamboo-growing 
world, in order to determine what kind was the 
best for the purpose. Nearly one hundred 
thousand doUars was spent in this bamboo-hunt, 
but the desired end was attained. 

Descriptions of many other interesting experi- 
ments and a sufficient number of not too tech- 
nical accounts of Edisonian inventions find a 
place in the book. Judged by the number and 
importance of his inventions, Mr. Edison is the 
greatest inventor the world has yet seen. Out 
of twelve hundred applications for patents in 
this country, more than eight hundred have been 
granted so far ; and for patents in most of the 
other countries more than two thousand appli- 
cations have been filed. 

The closing chapters of the book treat more 
especially of Mr. Edison the man, rather than 
the inventor. He is delightfully human in his 
attributes, as one learns from the following 
descriptive passage : 

" Some one has described Edison as ' thoroughly 
comfortable and undeniably human.' It is a queer form 
of description, and yet it suits the inventor admirably. 
Those portraits or drawings which show him with head 
resting upon his hand, and a solemn, dreamy look in his 
eyes, are all wrong. Edispn is the exact reverse of a 
dreamer, and always has been — he never gives himself 
time to dream, and his chief characteristics through life 
have been marvellous alertness, indomitable determina- 
tion, and mercurial energy. His eyes are more often 
laughing with suppressed humor than solemn with 
thought. When he was a young man, and no one knew 
him, he was shy in disposition and seldom spoke of him- 
self or his doings. When he became famous he did not 
' grow out of proportion to himself,' but was the same 
simple, unaffected human being that he had always been. 
He has about as much conceit and self-esteem as there 
is air in one of his own electric globes, and the thing he 
fears most in life is a ' swelled head.' His kindliness 
is unfailing, and he never loses his temper. No man 
in the laboratory has ever seen Edison < let himself go '; 
and though his eyes may take on the sternness of a 
Napoleon, his anger never expresses itself outwardly." 

An abundance of illustrative anecdote fol- 
lows, and these little characteristic incidents, 
combined with the numerous pictures of the man 
in various unstudied attitudes, make the reader 
feel something very like a personal acquaintance 
with him by the time the last page is reached 
With young men possessed of some love of 
science, fondness for machinery, a taste for ex- 
perimenting, and a touch perhaps of inventive 
genius, the book is sure to be a favorite ; as a 
finger-post pointing the way to success for brains, 
and energy, it ought to exert a good influence ; 
and its attractiveness to the lover of biography 
is beyond dispute. Percy F. Bicknell.

The Colonial, Relations of England 
AND America.* 



So many really excellent works dealing with 
the causes and events of the American Revolution 
have appeared of late that we scarcely feel the 
need of additional ones. Anything that ade- 
quately reproduces an historical period is of 
course welcome, especially when it comes from 
the pen of an accredited author. But what shall 
we say when the writer is seemingly unknown, at 
least among sober critical scholars ? Shall we 
say that the work will be any the less welcome, or 
simply that it will be more searchingly examined ? 
This question calls for practical application in 
the case of Mrs. Mary A. M. Marks, who, from 
her home in the British Isles, has sent out two 
most interesting volumes on " England and 
America, 1763-1783." 

In the Introduction to these volumes, we 
notice a very suggestive passage which reads as 
foUows : " It is always interesting, and often 
instructive, to look back and see how the great 
events of the past appeared while they were taking 
place, and to compare contemporary views with 
the final verdict of history." This is the key to 
Mrs. Marks's present work. Her authorities 
are almost exclusively contemporaneous in char- 
acter, and, as far as the mother country is 
concerned, are fairly comprehensive ; but on 
the colonial side they are, unfortunately, very 
limited. It might be said that this is only nat- 
ural, — and so it may be ; but still it is hardly 
excusable. The historian of to-day knows no 
barrier of distance, no dividing line of land or 
sea. In this particular instance, however, the 
fault — and surely we must call it such — of 
ignoring sources from abroad, can be, from one 
point of view, fully condoned ; for, in carrying 
out her general scheme of things, Mrs. Marks 
was not nearly so dependent upon documentary 
sources as she was upon narrative ones ; and 
could, therefore, quite easily dispense with 
colonial official records. With respect to co- 
lonial doings, she accepted facts as she found 
them in fairly reputable secondary authorities, 
and seemed to take it for granted that the 
reader would know all about them without his 
attention being called to them by her. Her 
interest was centred absolutely upon British 
contemporary opinions ; and in treating of them 
she has produced what all must admit to be a 
very creditable piece of work. Her main 
dependence was of course upon the Parlia-

Beaction. By Mary A. M. Marks. In two volumes. New York: 
D. Appleton & Co. 



mentary History. Dare we say that some of 
her chapters are a mere epitome of it? In 
truth they are an epitome, yet they are much 
more ; for at frequent intervals their narrative 
style is greatly enlivened by anecdotes, by glean- 
ings from .memoirs like Wraxall's, and by per- 
sonal estimates of great men drawn from the 
writings of their contemporaries, associates, and 
friends. 

We have dealt with the carrying out of the 
first part of our author's purpose, and have 
found it good. Let us now consider the carry- 
ing out of the second part. The report here 
cannot be nearly so favorable. Mrs. Marks, 
although hailing from the British Isles and 
presumably a Briton by birth or adoption, is 
extremely pro-colonial — unnecessarily so, in 
fact. In many instances her account is so 
colored that the reader is obliged to infer one 
of two things : either that she is over-careful, 
and so desperately afraid of being thought 
prejudiced in favor of her own country that she 
errs in the other direction, or that she is pos- 
itively ignorant of the final verdict of history. 
Who to-day, knowing that Bancroft wrote at a 
very anti-British period of American history, 
would think of accepting his judgment as conclu- 
sive, especially when Lecky, Van Tyne, Winsor, 
and many more, have all supplemented him and 
have been generally accepted as in the highest 
degree authoritative by historical scholars ? 
Nevertheless, Mrs. Marks often takes Bancroft 
for her only guide, and has apparently regarded 
him as almost the only great secondary Amer- 
ican writer worthy a place in her bibliography. 

We have already remarked that our author 
takes colonial facts for granted. She does more 
than that. She gives as sober history myths 
like the Putnam wolf story, and offers an 
account of the Mecklenburg Declaration of 
Independence without the slightest aUusion to 
its doubtful authenticity or to the long con- 
troversy concerning it. Likewise, she gives the 
traditional details of the Peggy Stewart affair 
and of the Boston tea-party. 

On the side of technical construction, a few 
general criticisms are needed. Errors fre- 
quently occur, not so much in the body of the 
text as in the footnote references. These errors 
are largely born of carelessness ; quotation 
marks are omitted or misplaced, paraphrases 
are confounded with quotations, the works of 
authors are variously and often ambiguously 
cited, and sometimes even the original has been 
inaccurately rendered. 

But the really great merit of the book has 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



129 



yet to be remarked upon. It lies in its inclu- 
siveness. Mrs. Marks has taken a wonderfully 
broad view of her subject. She has treated 
colonial pre-Revolutionary affairs as a part only 
of British eighteenth-century history. India 
and other imperial possessions, at that time 
fully as important as the famous Thirteen, 
receive more or less attention, and home com- 
plications and local politics are given their due 
weight. This fact alone ought to commend the 
book to the favorable notice of specialists as well 
as of general readers, and win for it a place by 
the side of Trevelyan's.

Two Studies of George Meredith.* 



A certain passion for orderliness seems to have 
possessed Mr. Elmer James Bailey while he 
wrote of the novels of George Meredith. Each 
work is assigned its particidar place in the 
scheme of the whole, like cards in a library cata- 
logue ; and its displacement would be, one feels, 
equally improper. Throughout the study, it is 
assumed that a network of analogies and simil- 
arities binds his novels into a fabric of firmest 
texture, — that, large and thickly settled as the 
world seen in them is, the chief inhabitants, if 
not all of one nation, are plainly of one family ; 
that they and the ordeals through which they 
pass are the product of one creative mind. The 
relation between Meredith's various novels is 
Mr. Bailey's point of departure. 

Borrowing terms from the artisan, he divides 
the fiction of Meredith into three periods, in 
which the author showed himself successively 
an apprentice, a journeyman, and a master- 
workman. To the first belong " The Shaving 
of Shagpat " and "Farina," — the work of a 
writer strongly suggesting some of his prede- 
cessors and contemporaries, yet showing certain 
individual traits which later on were so highly 
colored. In the second period, although Meredith 
had discovered the bent of his genius and was 
consciously possessed of power and skill, yet he 
was indubitably influenced by the writings of 
Richardson and Fielding and Sterne, Dickens 
and Thackeray and George Eliot. The novels 
then produced (" Richard Feverel," " Evan 
Harrington," "Sandra Belloni," " Vittoria," 
and " Rhoda Fleming ") were also an attack 
upon a sentimental deference to various long-

James Bailey. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons.

Sturge Henderson. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



michallenged ideals. When Meredith became a 
master- workman, emancipated and Meredithian, 
he entered upon a period of free invention in 
which he attacked egoism (in "Harry Rich- 
mond," "Beauchamp's Career," "Short Stories," 
" The Egoist," and " The Tragic Comedians "), 
and then concentrated his interest into an assault 
upon the seemingly impregnable conventionality 
which looks upon the marriage-bond as indis- 
soluble (in " Diana of the Cross ways," " Lord 
Ormont and his Aminta," " One of Our 
Conquerors," and " The Amazing Marriage "). 
Such, briefly stated, is Mr. Bailey's classifica- 
tion ; and in making it, he analyzes the characters 
and situations with true insight, appreciation, and 
restraint. He clearly sees and feels Meredith's 
high ideals, his strength, his beauty of tempera- 
ment ; and yet, worthily of Meredith himself, he 
says, " Whatever the impulse of the heart, they 
[his readers] know that it should be tempered 
to the working of the brain ; and they therefore 
do not undertake to assert more than that 
Meredith must be regarded as no unworthy 
companion of the greatest English novelists." 

In Mr. Bailey's study, short, definite, and 
concise as it is, the scope did not include 
Meredith's poetry, which is but occasionally 
discussed and little quoted. Mrs. M. Sturge 
Henderson has been far more ambitious in her 
study of Meredith as novelist, poet, and reformer. 
So desirous, indeed, was Mrs. Henderson that 
her criticism should be comprehensive that she 
elicited the services of Mr. Basil de Selincourt 
to write four chapters on Meredith's poetry 
(xiv.-xvii.). This contribution has a double 
value : it is intrinsically of worth, in its subtle 
exposition of Meredith's philosophical thought 
and his poetical form or lack of it ; and, further, 
it goes far to illuminate the treatment of char- 
acter and situation in his novels. As Mrs. 
Henderson has said elsewhere in the book, 
" Meredith's poems are his novels in distillar 
tion." To quote again (chapter xvi.), "The 
distinctive quality of Meredith's poetical work 
depends for a large part of its value on the 
incisiveness, the grit, which are to be associated 
with the emphasis he thus lays upon the need 
for a firm foundation of vital energy^to the 
driving force, the horse-power of the soul." 
This conclusion is in tune with Mrs. Henderson's 
major premise, " Intermittently, Meredith is a 
great artist ; primarily and consistently, he is a 
moralist — a teacher." 

Making no such lines of demarcation and in- 
terception as does Mr. Bailey between Meredith's 
novels, Mrs. Henderson analyzes them in chrono- 



130 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



logical order, in detail, conscientiously and at 
times brilliantly, with the moralist and reformer 
ever in the foreground. Endowed as she is 
with a rare intellectual responsiveness, and 
thoroughly conversant with her subject, Mrs. 
Henderson is without doubt entitled to her 
opinions. From these, however, the student of 
Meredith may occasionally beg to dissent, — 
notably from the contention that " The Tragic 
Comedians " and " One of Our Conquerors " 
are among Meredith's greatest novels. Grant- 
ing at times a difference in estimates between 
the writer and the reader, the latter will find 
all that Mrs. Henderson has to say interesting 
and her quotations both beautiful and appro- 
priate. She is especially felicitous in some of 
her phrases describing Meredith's artisanship, 
— such as " his uniting of problem and pageant 
in the reading of life," and his " un vitalized " 
or " middle- distance " characters — the sisters 
Pole, for instance, in " Sandra Belloni." 

It gives one the feeling of being turned from 
a door, to find that both of Meredith's critics, 
sensitive as they are to his beauty, his brilliance, 
and the versatility of his intellect, fail to assign 
him unreservedly the highest of literary positions. 
Mrs. Henderson feels that where Meredith's 
genius falters, his judgment is not always ready 
to give support. " His inspiration," she says, 
" appears to lie in his poetic grasp, the intensity 
of realization with which he holds to the main 
issue and keeps it living, in defiance of the 
tangles and complexity he is forever weaving 
every side of it, and which might have been 
expected to prove fatal to the life within."

Railway Regulation.* 

Mr. Henry S. Haines speaks as an authority 
on railway questions. A member of the Socie- 
ties of Civil and Mechanical Engineers, he has 
in turn acted as vice-president and general 
manager of the " Plant System " of railroad and 
steamship lines and as a commissioner of the 
Southern States Freight Association, and he is 
widely and favorably known as a critic through 
his books on " Railway Management " and 
" Restrictive Railway Legislation." In a new 
volume he pursues the subject of railway con- 
trol through nine chapters, delivered as lectures 
less than a year ago before the Boston Uni- 

* Railway Corpok ations as Public Servants. By Henry S. 
Haines. New York: The Macmillan Co.

Merritt. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



versity School of Law. After discussing the 
nature of the public service rendered by a rail- 
road, the benefits conferred by it on the public, 
and the burdens imposed by it on the public, he 
comes to his main purpose — " the amelioration 
of the existing relations between railway corpo- 
rations and the public whom they serve." This 
is attempted in the four final chapters on the 
results of ineffectual control, the reasonableness 
of rates, the standard of service, and the proper 
regulation of service. 

Here we have a model treatise on a vexing 
question. Approaching this from the " inside " 
standpoint, equipped with expert experience, 
and yet with an a priori handicap — in the 
reader's opinion — through his very identifica- 
tion in sympathy with the railway managers, he 
soon commands respectful and admiring atten- 
tion through his dispassionate and judicial frame 
of mind, which never once fails him. He sees 
as a railway man — he sees as truly as one of 
the great travelling and shipping and consuming 
public. The tone and the temper are as admir- 
able as though he might be a university professor 
of railway economics engaged in academic dis- 
cussion. This contrasts favorably with the 
almost petulant impatience displayed in the 
recent special message of President Roosevelt, 
as he contemplates the obdurate federal judge 
who decides according to his conviction as to the 
law and the Constitution. We note the follow- 
ing passage : 

" Cases (under the Interstate Commerce Act) were 
contested step by step from the hearings before the 
Commission up through the lower courts, until at length 
they reached the Supreme Court for its interpretation. 
But in each case that court restricted its decision, as 
far as practicable, to the issues directly involved in the 
case on appeal; and frequently it happened that the 
appeal resulted in the case being sent back, either to a 
lower court with instructions, or to the Commission for 
a rehearing. It was a slow process, and one which 
severely tested the patience of those who felt that their 
grievances remained in the meantime imremedied. Yet 
it was necessarily consequent upon the application of 
legislation in an untried field of such magnitude, and 
which was occupied by a conflict of complicated inter- 
ests. By degrees the decisions of the Supreme Court 
dissipated the obscurity which had overshadowed the 
provisions of the Act, and pointed out the way to their 
proper interpretation." 

In this connection Mr. Merritt does equal 
justice to the Commission and to the Federal 
courts when he discerningly says : 

" The present Commission is composed of men of 
undoubted integrity and of great individual acumen. 
They have been battling with some of the greatest prob- 
lems which have ever confronted any similar body of 
men. The subject-matter with which they are dealing 
is of comparatively recent origin. Their decisions can- 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



131 



not be based upon a long line of judicial opinions. It is 
net at all surprising, therefore, that they have made 
mistakes. That those individuals whose limited field 
of investigation has been entirely confined to those cases 
where the decisions of the Commission have appeared the 
weakest, the purpose of whose investigations has been 
to find fault with the work of the Commission, should 
find abundant material for their purpose, is by no means 
remarkable. . . . With regard to the points of law upon 
which the Commission and the Courts have been at 
variance, the Commission has in each case assumed the 
reasonable interpretation which would give to the Inter- 
state Commerce Law the broad application which its 
framers evidently intended that it should have, whUe 
the Courts on the other hand have narrowed and moulded 
its application till its interpretation is more in accord- 
ance with the genius of our institutions, which is to give 
the largest possible range to private initiative which is 
consistent with equal rights and justice to all, by which 
policy it is believed that in the long run the greatest 
good will be secured for the greatest number." 

It may be pertinent to add that Courts which 
have given some recent decisions that are in 
every memory, deserve courteous treatment on 
the part of a government whose hands they have 
so much strengthened. The decision in the 
Brown case in 1896, which enabfes the govern- 
ment to give complete immunity to witnesses, 
and so secure testimony previously unattain- 
able; the Joint-Traffic decision in 1899 and 
the Addyston Pipe Company decision in 1899, 
which brought under the ban of the Sherman 
Act of 1890 any form of combination in 
restraint of trade by railroads and industrials 
respectively ; and the Northern Securities deci- 
sion in 1904, which forbade the railroads to 
smuggle in again the trust form of combination 
in the guise of a holding company ; these alone, 
out of a number, bear sufficient testimony to 
the cooperation of the Federal bench in the 
arduous undertaking of preventing injurious 
monopoly. When in 1892 the famous decision 
by Justice Blatchford in the Counselman case 
sustained this witness in his refusal to possibly 
incriminate himself, and Congress passed in the 
next session an act of immunity for witnesses 
imder such circumstances. Judge Grosscup, in 
the notable decision for James and McLeod, 
still sustained these witnesses in their refusal 
to testify, on the ground that the statute did not 
secure to a witness " his place in society, his good 
name in the world." Just now it is interesting 
to recall that the administration of that day 
did not publicly censure Judge Grosscup for a 
decision which arrested its procedure — for the 
government could not carry a criminal case 
further by appeal to a higher court. Silently 
the department of justice took up the line of 
march de novo on a similar case that came up 
just then in a lower court in Pennsylvania, 



and after three years the administration was 
rewarded for its patience and composure when, 
in the Brown case, the Supreme Court sustained 
the helpful decision rendered in the two lower 
courts. 

Mr. Haines, when he discusses rate-making, 
gets away from a crude " cost of service " theory, 
without landing in a brutal " what the traffic 
will bear." He says : 

" Viewing the service of transportation as a contract 
relation, the standard for determining the reasonable- 
ness of the compensation demanded for rendering a 
specific service should include, as one of its elements, a 
recognition of the value of the service to the person for 
whose benefit it is performed, as well as the cost to the 
person performing it. . . . The cost is the lowest com- 
pensation that the carrier would accept ; its value to the 
traveller or shipper is the highest compensation that he 
would pay. Somewhere between these limits there is a 
balance or reasonable adjustment of the benefit to each 
of the parties to the transaction." 

That " somewhere " he further indicates in 
saying : 

" An average standard of service should be estab- 
lished as to speed of trains, character of equipment, and 
other conditions as to safety, comfort and convenience ; 
the number and frequency of such trains should be 
suited to the average requirements of the people in 
general ; and this service should be rendered at a fixed 
rate per mile per passenger. . . . Viewing the railroad 
company as a public servant, it would be expected to 
meet the necessary requirements of the public at large 
at the actual cost of service, that cost including a fair 
rate of interest upon the investment in private property. 
... If the necessary requirements of the travelling 
public are to be furnished at cost, where is the profit to 
the railroad stockholder, the inducement to invest money 
in the performance of a public service ? The answer is 
based upon the other element of a reasonable rate — 
the value of the service performed in each specific 
transaction apart from its value as a necessary require- 
ment for the people in general. The specific value to 
each person is in the different character of the service 
rendered, the difference to be measured by the depart- 
ure from the average service required for the average 
mileage rate of fare." 

Mr. Haines suggests that this departure from 
the average service may involve greater speed, 
or better accommodations, and that the carriers 
should sell such higher values in speed and com- 
fort for what they could obtain. He would 
make an average service second class, a better 
than average first class, and a less than average 
third class. This is his proposition for passenger 
traffic. Coming to freight traffic, he seeks to 
find " some commodity which in weight and bulk 
constitutes an average percentage of the total 
traffic, and which is not susceptible of the dis- 
tinctions as to inherent qualities, manner of 
packing, and insurable value, which affect the 
classification of most commodities for transpor- 
tation by rail. It should be a commodity in 



132 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



such general use that fluctuations in its price 
would not merely affect a class of users, but 
would exert a general and profound influence 
upon the public welfare." He finds this in 
bituminous coal, and would base a reasonable 
rate on the average cost of service per ton mile, 
eliminating the elements of equipment other 
than motive power and those of receipt and 
delivery, since these may be and have been 
handled in private cars on private terminals. 

Space does not allow even the presentation of 
the forcible arguments set forth by Mr. Haines 
against government ownership, but a few words 
must be given to his suggestions for a more 
rational and effective control of railroads. He 
would " make the corporations penally respon- 
sible for results, — its officials also, if you 
please, — but leave the means to them." He 
would secure the advantages of unified railroad 
management and of efficient government super- 
vision, without permitting further consolidation 
or resorting to State ownership, by taking into 
counsel with the Interstate Commerce Commis- 
sion the American Railway Association and the 
traffic associations. The sooner public opinion 
removes the ban of outlawry from railway men 
as such, the sooner we may come to some rational 
control which recognizes the values and the 
rights involved on either side. 

This book is an admirable chapter added to 
the fruitful discussion of railway problems. One 
misleading misprint should be corrected in 
another edition by the insertion of a decimal 
point before the figures on page 111 giving the 
passenger rates in Germany, Russia, and India. 

Mr. Merritt's work on " Federal Regulation 
of Rates " is a prize volume in response to the 
generosity of Messrs. Hart, Schaffner, and Marx 
of Chicago, and is a careful and dispassionate 
piece of work. After showing that rates in this 
country have not been excessive, and that the 
public grievance is discrimination rather than 
extortion, the writer justifies federal control and 
condemns rate-making by a commission. In an 
excellent discussion of a rational plan for public 
control of rate-making, he suggests that some- 
thing must be wrong with the present commission 
plan in that it has produced such general dis- 
satisfaction. He gives the Commission due 
credit, and explains the fact that ninety per 
cent of the cases which it has carried to the 
courts have been decided against it, in the passage 
we have already cited. The radical basis of the 
weakness of the present Commission he very 
justly finds in the inconsistency of its functions. 



It is to the railroads " police magistrate, prose- 
cuting attorney, and judge ; the law imposes 
upon it both the administrative duty of investi- 
gating alleged violations of the law, and of 
prosecuting offenders, while at the same time it 
is given the quasi judicial duty of sitting as a 
court to try the cases in which it is itself fre- 
quently the prosecutor." He is not pleased 
with the discretionary power to fix rates given 
to the Commission by the Hepburn law, and his 
own constructive contribution to this discussion 
is the suggestion of a special court for the hand- 
ling of railway cases, to which the Commission 
could present its findings. To the objection that 
such a court could not be empowered to fix rates, 
but could merely declare certain rates illegal, and 
that an endless series of such declarations might 
be made necessary by the nominal reduction in 
infinitesimal sums, he well replies that a court 
can always enjoin the whole as well as the part 
of an unlawful thing. This book, while inferior 
in command of English style to the one reviewed 
with it, is of equal value as to the temper and 
the matter. Jq^ j. Halsey. 



Recent Fiction.* 



With unexpected promptitude, Mr. De Morgan 
has put forth a new novel, and for the third time 
in two years has provided his readers with a more 
delectable feast than many of them had ever hoped 
to partake of, except by going back to the bountiful 
tables spread for them by Dickens and Thackeray. 
Really, if this rate of production is kept up, our older 
novelists will have to look to their laurels, for the 
new one is fast proving himself their equal in rich- 
ness of mind, in depth of human sympathy, and in 
skilled delineation of character and contrivance of 
plot. We are not prepared to say that " Somehow 
Grood " is any better than its two predecessors ; but 
we are quite sure that it has given us the same 
general quality of enjoyment, and that a higher 
quality than is derivable from the work of any other 
novelist now living and active in either England or 
America. The announcement of its appearance will 
fill many hearts with anticipative joy, and its read- 
ing will realize every reasonable expectation. The 
tide, of course, is a Tennysonian tag, taken from one 
of the most familiar passages of " In Memoriam."

THE DIAL 



133 



The " sins of will " and " taints of blood " out of 
which good is finally wrought are revealed to us in 
somewhat shadowy outline, but we gather, as the 
story occasionally gives us glimpses of the past, 
enough of their general character to reconstruct the 
essentials of a basis of understanding. Some score 
of years before the story opens, an English girl had 
gone out to India and had fallen the victim of a 
seducer. We are not exactly told, but are made to 
infer, that her betrayer had resorted to a baseness 
that in some manner made her out to be less blame- 
worthy than a bare statement of her case would 
make her appear. Soon after the betrayal, the 
young Englishman to whom she was betrothed had 
come out to urge his claim, had married her, had 
afterwards discovered her secret, and, after vainly 
seeking a legal separation, had deserted wife and 
child, disappearing for parts unknown. It takes 
a long time for the reader to piece this history 
together (as readers of " Alice-f or-Short " wUl not 
need to be told), for the author makes a fine art of 
indirection, and one must have all the shrewdness 
of a detective to recognize the clues that are hidden 
in the most unexpected crevices of the text. The 
beginning of the story simply introduces to our atten- 
tion a bronzed stranger arriving in London and 
making the preliminary arrangements for settling 
down in a country which he has evidently not visited 
for many years. He is a man of wealth, for he has 
cabled to New York for credit, but that is practi- 
cally all that we are told about him. Before he has 
been in London twenty-four hours he has an acci- 
dent in the Twopenny Tube which gives the story 
its real starting-point. Reaching under the seat to 
recover a lost coin, he receives a current of high 
voltage, and, otherwise rallying from the shock, it 
is foimd that his memory has completely disappeared. 
He knows nothing of the past, does not even remem- 
ber his own name. A young woman, his fellow- 
passenger, having been talking with him just before, 
feels somehow responsible for him, and, not knowing 
what else to do, takes him to her home in a cab. 
Now this young woman is his own daughter, legally 
although not legitimately, and her mother is the wife 
whom he has not seen for twenty years. When the 
mother (and wife ) sees him, she knows him at once, 
but restrains herself to the point of making no exhi- 
bition of her emotion. During the following days, 
as the stranger becomes a normal man again in all 
respects save that of his lapsed memory, he proves 
so agreeable an inmate of the household that he 
is invited to stay on ; he gets a business position in 
the city, and settles down to a routine existence. 
As time goes on, he comes to love the woman who 
has befriended him, but is always haunted by the 
fear that somewhere in his forgotten past there may 
be a wife who is mourning his disappearance. The 
real wife, meanwhile, does not dare to enlighten 
him, for that might mean a recurrence of the old 
repulsion, and a second desertion. After a while, 
however, both yield to the call of affection, and a 
wedding takes place. The leading interest of the 



story, from this time on, is found in the psychologi- 
cal study of the man's mind, for memory does come 
fully back to him in the end, but by slow degrees 
and evoked by all sorts of subtly suggestive associ- 
ations. In this aspect, the author's treatment of the 
story is absolutely masterly, revealing, if anything, 
a higher power than is displayed in his earlier novels. 
When recollection returns to him in full flood, its 
imagined terrors are dissipated for both man and 
woman, and the tale ends serenely. Space does not 
permit us to write at any length of the minor char- 
acters or the secondary elements of the plot. There 
are a dozen other figures besides those of the two prin- 
cipals, outlined with penetration and genial insight, — 
figures that the best of novelists might be proud to 
own. The young people concerned have their love- 
stories also, and two such affairs, discussed and illus- 
trated at great length, lend their charm to the 
narrative. The plot, while simple in one sense, is 
extremely ingenious and complicated in another, for 
it involves the twisting together of two sets of threads, 
broken for many years, and the uniting into a con- 
gruous whole of elements seemingly almost as dis- 
parate as those of " Alice-for-Short," And the 
writer's style — simple and natural, freighted alter- 
nately with rich humor and warm-hearted philosophy 
— is so enjoyable on its own account that it makes 
garrulity a virtue, and gives point to the most point- 
less of digressions. If yearly novels from this master- 
hand are to be a feature of the bookish future, we shall 
hope to keep a hold upon life as long as they last. 

Another of the novels which Mr. E. F. Benson 
puts forth with such unflagging industry is at hand. 
It is entitled " Sheaves," which may mean anything 
you wish, and introduces us to a group of the English 
gentlefolk whose lives and manners and ideas the 
author knows so intimately. They are interesting 
people, and their characters are drawn for us with 
evident fidelity. Conversation and incident are alike 
natural, and the author's contribution of comment 
and analysis is temperate and pleasing. The lead- 
ing purpose of the story is to study the case of a 
man married to a woman many years his senior. It 
is an ideal union in all respects save that of age, and 
nothing mars its happiness until the wife contracts 
tuberculosis, and the couple join the colony of exiles 
at Davos. A year or two still remains for her, and 
their happiness goes on under the new conditions 
with hardly a flaw. But the end is inevitable, and 
when it comes we have a feeling that the author 
found it a relief — that he could not see how to 
sustain the unnatural situation any longer. It must 
be admitted that the story, even then, is drawn out 
to tiresome length, and that it demands much judi- 
cious skipping if it is to provide tolerable entertain- 
ment. Mr. Benson is too facile a writer to achieve 
the higher aims of fiction, and one is not likely to 
remember his novels six months after having read 
them. 

Mr. Harold Bindloss takes us to the Canaries and 
the west coast of Africa for the scene of his 
novel. " For Jacinta " tells us, in the main, 



134 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



desperate venture which has for its object the float- 
ing of a sunken ship and the salvage of its cargo of 
palm oil. Two men engage in this enterprise, both 
for love. It is the story of a struggle with loath- 
some conditions and deadly disease, told with much 
of the grim power that Mr. Conrad has applied to 
similar situations. The strong man contending with 
adverse circumstance is evidently the favorite theme 
of this writer, who has illustrated it alike in the 
Cuban jungle and on the prairies of the Canadian 
northwest. He now gives us a new variant upon 
the same theme. Jacinta, the daughter of an English 
merchant in the Canaries, is the sort of heroine who 
is so keen about character that, before she wUl sur- 
render to a man's love, she will insist upon his 
acquiring merit (as the Japanese say) by meeting 
the test of danger, and staking his life for her sake 
upon the odd chance of success. This does not seem 
to us altogether admirable, but the hero seems to 
have liked her all the more for it, and took the risk. 
The story is capitally told, and takes us to an inter- 
esting part of the world not much frequented by 
novelists. As in all the books by Mr. Bindloss that 
we have read, the money motive is forced a little too 
much, jarring the romantic sensibilities to which he 
particularly endeavors to appeal. 

A lumber camp which seems to be somewhere in 
the Oregon country is the scene of Miss Mantle's 
" Gret." Gret is unfortunate in her parents. Her 
father, who owns the camp, prefers the gaiety of 
Portland to the simple life of the woods, and her 
mother, who lives in the camp with her, lets the 
child grow up without much care. In consequence, 
Gret is a very unconventional maiden with ideas of 
her own. She has also engaging qualities which 
make her the idol of the men, and her sway over her 
rough subjects is absolute. One day a youth sug- 
gests that they get married, and Gret, after weighing 
the suggestion and realizing that relations with her 
own family are getting a little strained, falls in with 
the plan. Her only idea about it is that if the trouble 
at home should become acute, she would want another 
place to go to. So the two start out one morning on 
an all-day excursion, and when they return in the 
evening they have been united by a justice of the peace 
of a town some miles distant. But on the way back 
Gret calmly informs the youth that he is to say 
nothing about it until he gets her permission. Then 
months, and even years go by, and nothing more 
is said upon the subject. They meet casually in the 
camp, but the marriage episode is completely ignored 
and practically forgotten. Presently a glimpse of 
the great world comes to our little pagan heroine, 
brought by some young men who undertake to 
operate a saw-mill in the neighborhood of the camp. 
Their ignorance is so pathetic that Gret is moved to 
pity, takes the burden upon her shoulders, and con- 
verts failure into success. A man of wealth and 
culture comes to visit them, makes Gret's acquaint- 
ance, and is charmed by her unsophistication and 
native strength of character. She offers so refresh- 
ing a contrast to the women of the world whom he 



has known and who have for many years sought to 
make him their prey, that he asks her to be his wife, 
and she, having learned for the first time the mean- 
ing of love, joyfully consents. Then follows a season 
in San Francisco, where Gret blossoms out and wins 
all hearts by her fresh charm. Then comes a return 
to the camp, and the discovery of Gret's early mar- 
riage. She is quite frank about it, and admits to 
him that she had never intended to mention the in- 
cident, regarding it as closed and quite insignificant. 
Naturally, the man of the world cannot view the 
matter in just that light, and Gret's romance is 
ended forever. Thus is brought to its semi-tragic 
conclusion a story which is told with singular charm, 
and which is remarkable alike for picturesque 
quality and penetrative insight into character. 

Miss Glasgow's latest novel has both dignity and 
charm, although certain almost melodramatic hap- 
penings, huddled into the closing chapters, do not 
seem quite in keeping with the sincerity and restraint 
of what has gone before. " The Ancient Law " is 
the title of the book, and its theme is the inevitable 
consequence of sin. The hero, when we first make 
his acquaintance, has just been released from prison, 
where he has served a term of several years for the 
fraudulent diversion of trust funds. He had been 
happUy married, but temptation had proved too much 
for him, and a desire to keep the pace of New York 
life had led to his downfall. In consequence of his 
crime, his father (a wealthy Virginian) had dis- 
owned him, but had offered a home to his wife and 
child. We meet him one spring morning, on the 
road in Virginia, ready to start life anew. His 
prison years have chastened him, and the wild 
impulses which had once made him a criminal have 
been wholly subdued. His one purpose henceforth 
is to expiate his fault by a life of helpful service to 
his fellows. He settles in the first country town 
that offers him an opening, and soon strikes root 
there. His past is behind him, and his new asso- 
ciates know nothing of it. His kindly ways soon 
win for him the esteem of the little community, and 
presently his neighbors turn to him for leadership 
and even seek to make him the mayor of the town. 
Then the long-delayed blow falls upon his head ; the 
story of his past comes out, and he determines to 
seek a new home. At just this juncture, however, 
news comes to him of his father's death, and of the 
wish of his wife and child that he should come to 
live with them again. The double crisis occurs 
midway in the narrative, and gives a new complexion 
to the second half of the book. His life henceforth 
is one of luxury but also of moral isolation. He is 
received by his family, but cannot be one of them. 
He has offended their proudest traditions, and the 
reconciliation is only a surface affair. The wife wUl 
do her duty by him, but she cannot control the feel- 
ing of repulsion which his presence creates. His 
only comfort is in his daughter, who loves him, but 
in whose nature he discovers an alarming intensifi- 
cation of his own early recklessness. This, in fact, 
leads her to the brink of disaster, from which, for a

time, he rescues her. The later chapters of the story 
have a sort of Jean Valjean pathos that works 
powerfully upon the reader's feelings. The end is 
rather inconclusive, hut falls just short of tragedy, 
for it leaves the hero with the prospect of a return 
to the little town in which his new life hegan, and 
of a peaceful rounding out of a destiny that had 
once seemed hopelessly shattered.

r . J The name of Mr. E. V. Lucas is 

essays of the probably associated by most Ameri- 
EUansort. ^^-^^ readers with a series of delight- 

ful anthologies, delightfully named. " The Open 
Road," " The Friendly Town," " The Gentlest Art," 
— each title is alluring, and the contents, chosen on 
no merely mechanical principle, amply fulfil the 
promise of the titles. But Mr. Lucas's literary 
labors are not limited to compilation ; he is also an 
essayist with several small volumes to his credit, each 
marked by the same unique quality that distinguishes 
his editorial work. The latest of these, " Character 
and Comedy" (Macmillan), is made up in about 
equal parts of informal essays and sketches and of 
ironic episodes related by means of letters. The 
essays are of an Elian flavor, full of piquant humor, 
keen psychology, intent and happy observation of 
the minor issues of life. " I am not lucky," com- 
plains Mr. Lucas, apropos of his exceptional experi- 
ences with a Persian kitten. " The harvest of my 
quiet eye comprises little that is unusual." And so 
he asserts a great envy of men who have "the luck 
of the woods " (as he calls the faculty of happening 
upon the rare and curious sights of nature), a great 
liking for detective stories and for "the old-fashioned 
novel in which there are long journeys, and in which 
new characters are continually appearing," and a 
firm conviction that the perfect life is that of the 
conjurer who goes about " continually mystifying 
fresh groups of people — with cab fares both ways 
and a satisfactory fee." This playful, unhurried 
view of life — with long afternoons to spend poking 
about the Zoo, summer holidays for walking trips 
through quiet Shropshire, spare time to enjoy 
Boswell and to evoke a flesh-and-blood cousin for 
Charles Lamb out of a casual reference in a letter — 
this sort of life is finding less and less expression in 
the world of letters. Wherefore many readers, who 
lament the passing of the essay, will welcome Mr. 
Lucas's practice of it. The epistolary comedies are 
amusing in their way, but Mr. Lucas lacks the dra- 
matic sense to bring them to a telling climax. 

Seven studies. The actor's craft and personality are 
dramatic and receiving at least their share of atten- 
criminological. ti^^ j^ contemporary publications; 
and one could wish that more of the articles and 
books in this field exhibited the quiet tone, the 
neglect of the negligible, and the almost legal bal- 



ance of Mr. H. B. Irving's " Occasional Papers " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.). The author is a student 
of history with a good Oxford training, a member 
of the English bar, and a successful actor, repre- 
senting the honorable traditions and aspirations of 
the best dramatic circles. All of these influences 
are apparent in the present volume. The first four 
essays deal with such topics as " The Calling of the 
Actor " and " The English Stage in the Eighteenth 
Century." Under the latter caption, which belongs 
to the most serious study in the volume, Mr. Irving 
points out that during this second great century of 
our national stage the interest shifts from the drama 
to the player ; it was the age of plays deserving 
soon to die, presented by actors of enduring fame, 
who were spurred to the highest histrionic effort by 
the inadequate scenery, the anachronous costumes, 
and the immediate criticism of a most free-speaking 
body of spectators. Of this last incentive many 
instances, some of them even literally striking, are 
embodied in the chapter. The second and fourth 
essays might have been welded advantageously into 
one, offering a discussion of the actor's calling and 
status. There is not a little suggestiveness in the 
constant recurrence of such expressions as " social 
recognition," and in Mr. Irving's emphasis on the 
growing respectability of the craft. One encourag- 
ing and laudable feature is the author's insistence 
on the desirability and possibility of unsullied char- 
acter and lofty moral ideals in the life behind the 
scenes and off the stage. The last three studies are 
devoted to three notorious criminal cases, which are 
readably presented with no disturbing suggestion of 
the " detective " method. Between the two parts 
of the work there seems to be no necessary connec- 
tion, — although it is possible that by some subtle 
psychology the reader interested in the actor is often 
interested in the criminal, and the present reviewer 
may admit that he passed from the first division of 
essays to the second with no particular difficulty. 
On the whole, the hours devoted to Mr. Irving's 
" Occasional Papers " will be spent pleasantly, and 
not without gain, by readers who have not already 
come across most of the studies in the English 
magazines.

136 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



of 168 pages takes the form of a commentary on the 
famous Chapter of Thucydides (II. 15) in which 
the historian demonstrates the small compass of 
primitive Athens by the fact that the oldest shrines 
are all either on the Acropolis or in the adjoining 
precinct to the south (or southwest). Miss Harri- 
son discusses all the old topographical problems 
which look so large when we are at Athens, and so 
small, except to specialists, when we are away. She 
tells us all that is known and much that is conjec- 
tured of the earlier pre-Persian Athens on which 
Pater's imagination so fondly dwelt, and of the 
earliest Mycenaean Athens on the Acropolis. She 
gives her reasons as a scholar, but what is perhaps 
her chief reason she does not explicitly mention : 
Dr. DOrpfeld, most persuasive of lecturers, most 
fascinating in personality, is infallible. Miss 
Harrison's book, which is admirably illustrated, is 
by no means too technical to be enjoyed by any 
intelligent reader who has visited or intends to visit 
Athens. But only in the pages of a technical 
journal could the dissenting critic animadvert upon 
her construing of Thucydides (in which she fol- 
lows Professor Verrall), her interpretation of the 
" Enneakrounos Episode," or her identification 
(pp. 97-8) of the Lensea with the Anthesteria in 
the face of recent evidence that proves them distinct. 

The freedmen Gteneral John Eaton's book entitled 
in and after " Grant, Lincoln, and the Freedmen " 
the Civil War. (Longmans) is an interesting and 
valuable addition to the historical literature of the 
Civil War period. It deals mainly with one sub- 
ject — the condition of the Southern negroes during 
the war, the efforts that were made to protect them 
from the results of their own ignorance, helplessness, 
and lack of morality, and the efforts to help them 
make the beginnings of an independent life. General 
Eaton, then Chaplain of an Ohio regiment, with some 
experience as a school superintendent, was selected 
by General Grant in 1862 to care for the contra- 
bands who were flocking by thousands into the Union 
lines. He shrank from the great burden ; but Grant, 
with the insight that marked his military appoint- 
ments, urged it upon him. It is needless to say that 
the work was carried on with ability and conscience, 
and that the efficiency of the Superintendent grew 
with the increase of the burden. General Eaton's 
duties and position brought him into intimate per- 
sonal contact with Grant, and they were friends 
until Grant's death. The book gives an insight into 
Grant's mind and heart that is exceedingly interest- 
ing. The author shows Grant's keen interest in the 
welfare of the freedmen, and his intuitive grasp of 
the great questions involved. Every appeal to him 
met with ready response and loyal support, and this 
interest and support were not lessened even when 
the awful responsibility of the whole war was put 
upon him. At the time when his own standing was 
still insecure. Grant took the risk of furnishing hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rations and 
clothing to the needy freedmen on his own respon- 



sibility, without orders or authority to do it. In 
1870 General Eaton was appointed by Grant Com- 
missioner of Education, and so maintained his per- 
sonal relations with him. The author was also 
brought into official and personal relations with 
Lincoln, and tells many interesting stories of those 
eventful years. 

Five years ago this journal noticed 
SrS*?^ Mr. Arthur Symons's volume entitled 

" Cities," and accorded its author the 
praise of treating with attractive individualism a 
commonplace theme. In his latest book, that well- 
known littSrateur has brought together such of his 
writings as he hoped would lay open to his readers 
the souls of some "Cities of Italy " (Button). " And 
as love, or it maybe hate, can alone reveal soul to 
soul, among human beings, so, it seems to me, the 
soul of a city will reveal itself only to those who 
love, or, perhaps, hate it, with a far-sighted emotion." 
In this frame of mind, which is becoming delight- 
fully familiar and has been so daintily voiced by 
" Vernon Lee " in her " Genius Loci," Mr. Symons 
deals with the historic centres of Italian life and cul- 
ture. Not seldom his treatment becomes purely a con- 
sideration of the local manifestation of the art spirit, 
— as in the pages on Brescia ; nor are the sections 
representing this tendency the least attractive in the 
book to a reader at all interested in Italian painting. 
Space forbids the recording of mUd protests ; but the 
reviewer happened to spend the same winter in Rome 
that gave Mr. Symons the basis of his chapters on 
that ever-beloved mistress of the seven hills, and we 
have one tiny quarrel : in the course of forty pages 
our author lovingly describes three sunsets, whereas 
the glorious softly-shifting lights of those wintry 
mornings are coldly neglected. And this personal 
subjective difference may serve to indicate pretty 
adequately the tone of most of the criticisms we 
should pass upon the book. It is a volume well 
worth while, and will be enjoyed by many readers ; 
it will be most valuable and most enjoyable for those 
who have basked long enough in Italy's smile and 
learned enough of her nature to compare impressions 
and to enter upon the little, lovable, silent contro- 
versies that add so much flavor to literature of this 
type.

the glass has been divided into three groups : 
thirteenth century and earlier, fourteenth and fif-

epoch a tour has been arranged, with a map showing 
the most convenient order to pursue in visiting the 
various churches and chateaux. Mr. Sherrill's 
descriptions of the distinctive windows in each town 
are simple, non-technical, and interesting. The 
subject of glass is inextricably associated with the 
more general one of architecture, but Mr. Sherrill 
displays a nice sense of proportion in making the 
necessary connection and yet keeping strictly to his 

chosen field. 

Some literary ^ ^ozen essays of varying merit 
opinions and make up the volume of Professor 
examinations. Brander Matthews's " Inquiries and 
Opinions " (Scribner). Some of them might better 
have been left to the temporary honor of the popu- 
lar magazine, to be read and enjoyed and forgotten ; 
others deserve the doubtful permanence given to-day 
by publication in book form. A short piece of bio- 
g^raphical criticism on Mark Twain, which has 
already served as an introduction to a complete 
edition of that author's works, aims at giving our 
greatest American humorist a place in literature 
among writers of high seriousness, such as Moli^re 
and Cervantes, Chaucer and Fielding. If he does 
not equal these mighty ones, our essayist holds, he 
belongs to their class, though how far down in the 
class it is for the future to declare. In this belief 
a good many admirers of Mark Twain will be ready 
to concur. The superiority of Poe's detective- 
stories is shown by comparison with the broken- 
backed productions of Gaboriau, not to mention the 
" thrillers " of the ten-cent magazines. It is inter- 
esting to note that none of these writers has improved 
in technique upon Poe, though, as Professor 
Matthews says in another essay in this volume, the 
followers usually improve upon the master in this 
respect. It merely means learning the rules of the 
game. How well Ibsen has learned these rules in 
the drama is clearly brought out in the essay on 
" Ibsen the Playwright." He is a consummate 
craftsman, chief in his own art, however much he 
may fall short of those great qualities which dis- 
tinguish Sophocles and Shakespeare and Molifere. 

An Americanos "Poland, the Knight among Na- 
impressions tions " (Revell), by Mr. Louis E.

first-hand study of the modern Polish nation, with 
some account of the history that has made her what 
she is. Mr. Van Norman visited Poland for the 
" Review of Reviews." He was treated with signal 
honors on various public occasions, and he stayed 
long enough to learn the language, enter into the 
life and the ideals of the people, and pay visits to 
their great men, including Sienkiewicz. His im- 



pressions of the country make interesting reading, 
because he is full of his subject and treats it from 
so many points of view. He takes his title from 
Victor Hugo's phrase for the role Poland has played 
as militant guardian of the western boundary of 
European civilization and the Christian faith. The 
relations of dismembered Poland with her three mas- 
ters — Russia, Austria, and Prussia — are explained 
in interesting chapters, which have for their sub- 
structure a close analysis of the Polish national char- 
acter, with its splendid virtues and fatal defects. 
Several Polish cities are described, including Czen- 
stochowa, *' the Mecca of the Poles "; while a 
chapter entitled " A Voyage over the Steppes " gives 
a vivid impression of the rural scenery. And to 
roimd out the picture there is an account of the 
great patriot Kosciuszko and of the nation's leading 
artists, musicians, and writers, as well as of some 
distinguished Polish-Americans.

of an introductory account of the characteristics of 
the four periods of English home-building, with 
the emphasis on the two earlier ones, and of full 
descriptions of the fifty houses with whose interior 
decoration and furnishings and exterior appearance 
Mr. Latham's pictures make us familiar. In most 
cases, also, a good deal of the history of successive 
owners of the castles and estates is interwoven with 
the account of the additions and restorations that 
they made to their property ; and in a few instances, 
— for example, Knebworth House, owned by the 
Lyttons, — the interesting family associations seem, 
to be the chief reason for describing the mansion. 
Mr. Tipping promises another volume that shall be 
devoted to buildings of the classic and modern 
schools, but there are a few wholly modern houses 
in this collection ; notably Clouds, in Salisbury, the 
crowning labor of Philip Webb, friend of Rossetti 
and Morris and architect of Morris's " Red House."" 
The fine quality of Mr. Latham's work as artist- 
photographer is well-known. For the present vol- 
ume he furnishes two hundred full-page plates and 
nearly as many smaller ones. The volume is sub- 
stantially bound in blue buckram. 

Ab I ted book ^^** appears to be a belated James- 
0/ the Jamestown town Exposition book is " The Old 
Exposition. South and the New, from the Earli- 

est Times to the Jamestown Exposition " (John C. 
Winston Co.). It contains over 600 pages, is- 
printed on heavy white smooth paper, and is pro- 
fusely illustrated with pictures of Southern people,, 
scenes, and buildings. The text, which contains- 
nothing new, gives an account of Southern history*

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



from the beginning to the present time. It is written 
in easy style, has many good anecdotes, and deals 
mainly with the personal and picturesque elements 
in Southern history. The latter part of the book 
has much about present conditions, — the race prob- 
lem, of course, the increasing output of staple crops, 
the development of mineral and forest wealth, the 
rise of manufactures and the growth of cities, and 
finally a history of Southern Expositions. In spite 
of the fact that in make-up it resembles the subscrip- 
tion book, it is better than most works of that kind, 
and will probably serve a useful purpose in giving 
some readers a knowledge of the South that they 
would not get from other accessible authorities. It 
is to be regretted that the author, Mr. Charles Morris, 
includes in his volume the classic myths about slavery 
and the Southern aristocracy. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



It is not so uncommon a thing for an author to illus- 
trate his own book; but for him also to design the 
make-up and set the type by hand is certainly unusual. 
This is what Mr. Ivan Swift has done for his volume 
entitled " Fagots of Cedar," a collection of verses of the 
Michigan woods and lumber camps, issued in an attrac- 
tively made limited edition with the imprint of The 
Outer's Book Press of Milwaukee. At its best Mr. 
Swift's verse is virile, rhythmical, and full of meaning, 
suggesting kinship with the school of Kipling and Henley. 

The following French texts have recently come to our 
desk: Hugo's "La L^gende des Si^cles" (Frowde), 
edited by Mr. G. F. Bridge; Barbier's "lambes et 
Pofemes " (Frowde), edited by Mr. Charles M. Gramier; 
" Contes Choisis," by Ren^ Bazin (Heath), edited by 
Professor Victor E. Francois; " Extracts for Composition 
in French " (Heath), by M. J. E. Mansion; "Exercises 
in French Prose Composition " (Heath), by Professor 
W. W. Comfort; a volume of " French Short Stories " 
(Holt), edited by Dr. Douglas L. Buffum; and Kenan's 
"Ma Sceiu- Henriette " (Holt), edited by Professor 
William F. Gr^se. 

For some strange reason, the collected editions of 
Herr Bjomson's novels, as published in both England 
and America, have hitherto failed to include his two 
most important works of this class. One of them, the 
greatest of all his novels, is now added to the edition 
published by the Macmillan Co. The work in question, 
" In God's Way," fills two volumes in the series edited 
by Mr. Edmund Gosse. The translation by Miss 
Elizabeth Carmichael, published somewhat furtively 
many years ago, is here reproduced, and Mr. Gosse's 
introduction even includes the statement that the author 
" has not yet approached his sixtieth year." Since he 
passed his seventy-fifth birthday last December, some- 
body is clearly chargeable with slovenliness in the 
preparation of these volumes for repubUcation. 

The china collector has no occasion nowadays to com- 
plain of lack of books about his fad, since nearly every 
month brings him a volume or two on some phase of 
the fascinating subject of ceramics. One of the latest 
to appear is Mr. C. H. Wylde's " How to Collect 
Continental China" (Macmillan). The initiated will 
probably know without being told that the " collector's 



period " in European porcelains is the end of the seven- 
teenth century and the eighteenth, since by the year 
1810 the art of china decoration had sadly declined. 
Mr. Wylde gives the history of all the important old 
European factories, devoting most space to Sevres, 
where soft paste porcelain reached its perfection, and to 
Meissen, where the use of hard paste was discovered 
There is also a careful account of the forms and styles 
of decoration characteristic of the various factories, 
many of whose productions are reproduced in some of 
the forty excellent plates. The makers' marks are also 
reproduced in facsimile. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the publishers 
of " An Alphabetical Subject Index and Index Encyclo- 
paedia to Periodical Articles on Religion, 1890-1899," 
compiled and edited by Mr. Ernest Cushing Richardson. 
This is a work of enormous industry, forming a volume 
of nearly twelve himdred closely printed pages, con- 
taining perhaps seventy tliousand references. If this 
represents the product of only ten years, it is evident 
that theological discussion does not suffer in our days 
from any lack of activity. Under the word " Bible " 
alone something like a thousand references are indexed. 
The number of periodicals indexed appears to be about 
fifteen himdred, and they represent all of the culturally 
important modern languages. Mr. Richardson has had 
several collaborators in this work, which is one of the 
most important bibliographical publications of recent 
years. 

A volume dealing with the work of Michael Angelo 
has been added to the familiar " Drawings of the Great 
Masters " series, and- one on Rembrandt, with an intro- 
duction by A. M. Hinds, to the similar series called 
"Great Etchers" (Scribner). The latter contains 
sixty-one plates arranged chronologically and together 
making an impressive commentary on the steady develop- 
ment of Rembrandt's genius. The introduction com- 
ments interestingly upon his choice of subjects, his 
artistic style and methods, and contemporary and present- 
day estimates of his etchings. Mr. E. Boroughs John- 
son contributes a commentary upon " The Drawings of 
Michsel Angelo," pointing out the wonderful draughts- 
manship and knowledge of human anatomy which are 
displayed in even the simplest of the cartoons. Several 
of these latter are reproduced in tint. 

Mr. L. Stanley Jast's "Classification of Library 
Economy and Office Papers" (and of supplies too, 
though that is not mentioned in its title), will give a 
fair idea of the manifold details that compose a modern 
librarian's daily life and work. For instance, — to choose 
from both the practical and cultural side of his calling, — 
under the head of "Extension Work" we find such 
matters as conferences between the library authorities 
and other organizations or public bodies, the relations 
of the library to local factories, exliibitions, circulars, 
and, of course, work with the schools and with children 
in general; and under the head of " Buildings " all the 
various rooms that are needed for the work of the 
library, including staff rooms and storage rooms, and 
then the matters of heating, ventilation, and the different 
kinds of furniture. The scheme is worked out as a part 
of Mr. J. D. Brown's " Subject Classification," and was 
first prmted as part of that work; it has now been 
issued separately, with a very full index. It might be 
found suggestive to others besides librarians who wish 
to keep in proper order theii- office papers and other 
memoranda, or an assortment of stationery suppUes.

Notes. 



A new edition, revised and enlarged, of Mr. Justin 
McCarthy's popular and readable " History of Our Own 
Times " is now published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. send us a volume of " Specimens 
of Prose Composition," for use in college classes, the 
work of Messrs. C. R, Nutter, F. W. C. Hersey, and 
C. N. Greenough. 

A third edition of Mr. George B, Rose's " Renaissance 
Masters " is published by the Messrs. Putnam. A new 
chapter on Claude Lorraine is now added to the seven 
of the original work. 

Dr. Walter Dennison has edited a volume of Livy for 
college use, and the text is published by the Macmillan 
Co. Book I. is given complete, but only selections from 
Books II. to IX. are included. 

Professor Schillings's " Don Basilio," being a practical 
guide to Spanish conversation and correspondence, edited 
by Mr. Frederick Zagel, is a recent educational publica- 
tion of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

« The Wisdom of the Wise," by Professor W. Cun- 
ningham, is a small volume containing three lectures 
on free trade imperialism, published by Messrs. Putnam 
for the Cambridge University Press. 

" Hamlet and the Ur-Hamlet " is the title of a new 
volume of "The Bankside-Restoration Shakespeare" 
The work has an introduction by Mr. Appleton Morgan, 
and is issued by the Shakespeare Society of New York. 

" Adventures with Indians " is the title of a new vol- 
ume in the " Stories of Adventure " series, published by 
the Messrs. Harper. There are a baker's dozen of the 
stories, by something less than that number of authors. 
Boys will like them. 

" Enamelling," by Mr. Lewis F. Day, is a work 
imported by the Messrs. Scribner, and forms a new 
volume in the series entitled " The Course of Art and 
Workmanship." The book is handsomely printed and 
has many illustrations. 

A quarto publication of the University of Pennsylvania 
gives us a " Catalogue and Re-measurement of the 648 
Double Stars Discovered by Professor G. W. Hough." 
This monograph is the work of Professor Eric Doolittle 
of the Flower Astronomical Observatory. 

Volume III. of " My Memoirs," by Alexandre Dumas, 
and two more volumes of the same author's " Celebrated 
Crimes," have just been published by the Macmillan 
Co. The introductions are furnished, respectively, by 
Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. R. S. Garnett. 

Volume II. of the revised edition of " A Treatise on 
Chemistry," by Messrs. Roscoe and Schorlemmer, is 
published by the Macmillan Co. It is a work of over 
fourteen hundred pages, having " The Metals " for its 
special subject-matter. The revision has been done by 
Sir H. E. Roscoe and Dr. A. Harden. 

Charles F. Chicester, treasurer of The Century Co. 
and one of its three trustees, died in New York on 
February 20. Mr. Chicester had been connected with 
The Century Co. since 1875, and his ability and judg- 
ment were vital factors in bringing this house to the 
honorable position it now holds in the American book 
trade. 

Two recent publications of the University of Penn- 
sylvania are of literary interest. " The Life and Works 
of Christobal Suitrez de Figueroa" is a study of an 
important Spanish author of the seventeenth century, 



in the form of a doctoral dissertation, by Mr. J. P. 
Wickersham Crawford. " Studies in the Word-Play of 
Plautus " is a thesis of similar nature, the work of Dr. 
Charles Jastrow Mendelsohn. 

Volume II., Part I., of Mr. Charles Sprague Sargent's 
" Trees and Shrubs," published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co., includes descriptions and drawings of 
twenty-five species of ligneous plants, hitherto unknown 
or almost so. Six of the species are of Crataegus and 
eight of Viburnum. The temainder represent eight 
other genera. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have published a new 
and cheaper edition of Professor Thomas R. Lounsbury's 
" Shakespeare as a Dramatic Artist." The new edition 
is made uniform with Professor Lounsbury's other 
Shakespearean studies, — " The Text of Shakespeare " 
and " Shakespeare and Voltaire," the three volumes 
being collectively known as "The Wars of Shake- 
speare." 

Mr. H. E. Krehbiel has edited for the " Musicians' 
Library " of the Messrs. Ditson a volume of " Songs 
from the Operas for Soprano." Nineteen composers are 
represented, from the early Italians (Caccini, Bononcini, 
and Pergolese) to the modem Frenchmen (Gounod, 
Delibes, and Bizet). The introductory matter is 
briefly but adequately descriptive of the selections, and 
the frontispiece is a group of nine portraits. .

FRANZ QRILLPARZER And the Austrian Drama 

By QUSTAV POLLAK 

MR, POLLAK, himself a Viennese by birth, has been a lifelong student of the literatiire and political history 
of his native land. As a contributor to the New York Nation since 1874, and to the New York Evening Post 
since 1881', he has had abundant opportunity of attesting his familiarity with Austrian topics. The volume is an 
outgrowth of two lectures on " Austrian Dramatists " delivered by him at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 
in April, 1905. He has been connected with the editorial revision of various encyclopaedic works, notably the New 
International Encyclopaedia (1902-4) and Nelson's Encyclopaedia (1905-6). During the Presidential campaign of 
1892 Mr. Pollak was associated with Carl Schurz, Henry Villard, Oswald Ottendorfer, and other prominent German- 
Americans in founding in New York the " German-American Reform Union." 



OPINIONS OF 

" Mr. Pollak's book is the first attempt, outside of our 
college world, to introduce Franz Grillparzer to American 
readers. ... As a son of the country which gave birth to 
the poet. Mr. Pollak is singularly fitted to interpret Grill- 
parzer's isolation in life and unique position in letters. . . . 
The metrical translations are an important feature of the 
book. With few exceptions they render with uncommon 
success the meaning and melody of the original." — Nation. 

" In the main, in its triple character of biography, criti- 
cism, and translation, it is an admirable piece of interpret- 
ation, and in view of the place which Grillparzer has come 
to hold in German literature, it can scarcely be doubted that 
Mr. Pollak, in introducing him more fully to the American 
public, has given us one of the most important books of the 
season." — New York Times. 

" The intrinsic merit of the book will add dignity to the 
position it wUl occupy as a pioneer in a little-known field." 

— Chicago Tribune. 

"Shows the ardent appreciation of one who has studied 
deeply into GriUparzer's work and accomplishments." 

— Boston Traiiscript. 



THE PRESS 

" Shows rare command of words and a musical ear. . . . 
His book will find an honorable niche on the shelf of liter- 
ary history." — Pittsburgh Oazette-Times. 

"Gustav Pollak has placed all students of the drama 
under a debt of gratitude." — Boston Herald. 

"The translations will allure many readers to the 
originals." — San Francitco Chronicle. 

"A real welcome wiU be accorded Mr. Gustav Pollak's 
study of this dramatist." — Review of Reviews. 

"The work must meet with the enthusiastic approval of 
those who rejoice in the introduction to American readers 
of such elements of the great foreign literatures as have thus 
far been inaccessible." — Cleveland Plain Dealer. 

"Not only a weighty contribution to literature, but a 
vivid and masterly account of the histoiy of the period. 
This admirable work fills with the greatest distinction a 
long-felt want." — New York Staats-Zeitung . 

"His selections are well made, and his versions have a 
good deal of merit ; his diction is often happy." 

— London Athenceum.

The readers of the Educational Review are studious teachers and students of education who 
wish to know the ripest thought, the newest investigations, and the best books on education.

A History of Sculpture 



By ERNEST H. SHORT. With many illustrations of the masterpieces of 

various schools and periods. 8vo. $3.00 net. 

"A History of Sculpture," although by no means a small book, is so simple in 
its outlines, so concentrated in its substance, and so welded by constant compari- 
son and reference, that one hardly realizes how many individual sculptors and 
how many great works are criticised in its pages until one notes the number of 
the pictures or the size of the index. Holding the theory that art can be under- 
stood only in the light of national and international history, and that schools of 
sculpture were really created by the peoples to whom they appealed, he has given 
closest attention to sculpture expressive of national feeling, and thus has made 
a history of sculpture more truly entitled to the name than those which merely 
tell of the passage of the torch of art from hand to hand.

A. B. Wenzell. even though it was generally known that the Doctor resented the Spaniard's persistent

that of De Sanchez, served to involve even more the already baffling situation. It remained 
for Converse, the most remarkable detective of recent fiction, to solve the double mystery, after a series of

the solution of the mystery but plays a part in the lives of the other characters. $1 .50

which had been almost eliminated. And when highly cultivated civilization was brought face to face with

FICTION 

The Husbands of Edith. ByGEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON, author of "Graustark," 
" The Day of the Dog," etc. Illustrations in color by Harrison Fisher, izmo, cloth . . . $1.25 
This is in Mr. McCutcheon's best style, which is to say that it is inimitably clever and entertaining. 
The story opens in Paris, where the hero is ingeniously induced by a friend, a young Englishman, to assume 
his identity for a few weeks and make a trip to Vienna. The Englishman disappears upon a mission of his 
own and the hero prepares for his trip. What is his horror when he learns that not only must he assume his 
friend's name, clothes, monocle and speech, but his wife and baby! To complicate matters, his supposed 
wife's sister, a charming girl, joins the party. The hero falls desperately in love with her, and is unable to 
conceal his feelings, not only from the young lady, but from anyone else. In this situation, the hero, with his 
supposed wife, baby and sister-in-law, sets out with a party of English tourists for a trip through the Tyrol. 
For the story of what happens there, told as Mr. McCutcheon can tell it, the reader is referred to the book itself.

There is always room for a story in which there is " something doing." " Meryl " moves with a whirl; 

it is modern, absorbing, exciting. It should be dedicated to tiresome journeys, sleepy evenings and dull days,

The Man Who Was Thursday. By gilbert k. chesterton, author of "Varied 

Types," " Heretics," etc. i2mo, cloth $1.50 

Mr. Chesterton is such a past-master in sophistries and casuistry, such a juggler of paradoxes, such an 
adept in the arts whereby the brilliant and quick-witted pull the wool over the eyes of their less gifted brethren, 
that he can give full and serious credibility to his tale of the astounding adventures of the detective who was 
admitted into the innermost circle of anarchists.

This is a theological novel, and such a good one that a distinguished critic who read the story before

8vo, flexible leather Special net, $2.75 

In view of the number of tourists who yearly visit these islands, there is great need of an accurate and 
comprehensive guide-book. Such a book has been prepared by Mr. Frederick A. Ober, who, having been 
intimately acquainted with the West Indies for thirty years, is well qualified for his task. It is a guide-book 
to the Bermudas, Bahamas, Cuba, Porto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti and Santo Domingo, the Danish, Virgin, 
Dutch, French, Leeward and Windward Islands, Barbados and Trinidad. It is comprehensive, accurate and 
convenient, giving all the information which a tourist desires as to routes, hotels, rates, places of interest, the 
history and present condition of the islands, their flora and fauna, commerce, natural resources, etc. This 
book should be the Standard Guide to the West Indies. 

Tuscan Feasts and Tuscan Friends. By dorothy nevile lees, illustrated, 

i2mo, cloth net, $1.60 

A charming book on a charming subject, will be the reader's verdict. From her home in a Tuscan villa 
near Florence the author sallies out into the country roundabout and returns with delightful sketches of the 
hills and woods, and the country people big and little. The author knows her Tuscan peasantry, from 
wrinkled grandfathers to tiny bambinos, and she writes of their work, their homes, their customs and their 
feasts with a sympathetic and sure touch. Individual characters are so deftly and feelingly portrayed that one 
might characterize the book as a kind of " Cranford " or "Our Village." 

Letters from Percy Bysshe Shelley to Elizabeth Hitchener. n 010 first 

published. With introduction and notes by Bertram Dobell. i2mo, cloth net, $1.50 

The forty-seven letters here printed were written between June, 181 1, and June, 1812. At that time 
Shelley was only about nineteen years of age, but during the period covered by the letters many of the most 
important events of his life took place. In fact, his life during these months was full of romantic incidents 
which were to leave their mark for good or evil on the whole of his future career. The letters are written in 
a strain of the most candid and unreserved self-revelation. They exhibit in the liveliest colors the character of 
this rash, chivalrous, frank, and generous youthful poet. Without them we should want by far the most 
important documents for the history of his life at this time ; with them we could dispense with all the other 
records of this period. 

Passages from the Past. By his grace, the duke of Argyll, author of "Life of 

Queen Victoria," etc. Copiously illustrated, large 8vo, cloth. Two volumes net, $6.^0 

The one important question in considering a volume of reminiscences is — has the author any recollections 
which interest other people? Certainly the Duke of Argyll, who is better known to Americans as the Marquis 
of Lome, one of the best and most popular of Canadian viceroys, has had better opportunities than fall to the 
lot of most men to store up interesting recollections. One of the leading peers of England, whose titles alone 
occupy twenty-four lines in " Who 's Who," a son-in-law of Queen Victoria and a man prominently con- 
nected with the English Government at home and abroad for a lifetime, there have been few prominent men 
and women in Europe and America in the last half century whom he has not known. Some of the famous 
persons whom he recalls in this volume of reminiscences, to mention them at haphazard, are: Wordsworth, 
Tennyson, Browning, Lord Brougham, Lord Dufferin, Cavour, Garibaldi, General Lee, General Grant, 
Seward, Longfellow, Bismarck, Emperor William I., Victor Emmanuel, Emperor Francis Joseph, Mr. 
Gladstone, Louis Napoleon and Eugenie, Disraeli, Queen Victoria and the royal family, of course, and 
others too numerous to mention. 

Myths about Monarchs. By HANSARD watt, author of " Home-made History." i2mo, 

cloth net, fi.oo 

A book of clever nonsense verses, some of which have already been published in "The Westminster 
Gazette," "The London Magazine," " Cassell's Magazine" and others. The author draws amusing

The object of this book is to acquaint the general reader with the remarkable discoveries of modern

Great Writers 

By Professor GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY 

Author of " The Torch," "Swinburne." 

OEBV ANTES. Scott, Milton, VirgU, Montaigne, and 
^^ Shakespeare are the writers whose work is here epit- 
omized in that graceful yet authoritative manner that has 
made Professor Woodberry rank as our foremost American 
critic. 

" A little cameo of biogrraphical criticism . . . the 
tradition of Lowell and Whipple still lives." —Pitts- 
burg Gazette-Times. 

" As he says of Virgil : — ' Only an immense love of 
life could so have revealed to him the pity of it ' — so 
there is in these essays a fulness of life, a maturity of 
vision and mellowness of experience which satisfies 
first the reader's iatelligence." — Baltimore News. 

"Should appeal with especial force to the lover of 
books, both by reason of the soundness and clarity 
of the author's analysis, and for the effective and 
graceful style in which his thought is expressed."

Jean Jacques Rousseau 

BY JULES LEMAITRE 

Member of the French Academy. 
THE announcement made last year that the veteran critic. 
1 M. Lemaitre, would lecture on Jean Jacques Rousseau 
was hailed with the greatest enthusiasm throughout France. 
The function was one of the best attended of the season. 
Published in the present volimie. the lectures are in the 
highest degree interesting and suggestive for the general 
reader in their treatment of the much misunderstood 
Rousseau. The work emphasizes more clearly than ever the 
primacy of M. Lemaitre in the field of French criticism. 

" M. Lemaitre is the foremost of living French critics, 
and his treatment of Rousseau leaves little to be 
desired. The troubled pitiful life revealed in the 
' Confessions ' serves as the discourse thread, and 
with sharp analysis, mordant wit, and clever epi- 
gram the writer hangs upon it his brilliant chapters."

Dear Sir, — It erives me grreat pleasure to tell you liow your paper, PUBLIC OPINION, answers 
a purpose in nay life. Althougrti I read a great deal, I find it impossible to keep abreast of the trend 
of higrber tbougrbt that Is groiner on around me, which can only be gathered from various articles and 
letters in newspapers, and articles in magrazines. But your paper gives me the assurance that I miss 
nothing which would be of use to me in the train of thought upon which I may just be engaged, 
and seldom does a weekly issue of PUBLIC OPINION appear from which I cannot cull some useful 
suggestion. As a lecturer on art, I need all the suggestions on life that I can get into my hands, for I 
treat art in all its phases popularly. From PUBLIC OPINION I get to know certain modern authors 
with whose methods of thinking I am in sympathy, and those I follow up further. Your paper does me 
the service to point to them. 

Your selection of current thought is worthy of all praise, for it gives one the wholesome feeling 
that the world is, after all, not going to the devil, but contains thinkers and good men and women. 

I wish you, with all my heart, continuous success with your paper.

A NOTABLY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT NEW BOOK 

Lord Cromer's great work on Modern Egypt 

In two 8vo volumes, with portrait and map. $6.00 net. Ready this day. 

It is unnecessary to dwell upon the importance of this announcement, for it will without doubt 
excite the liveliest interest in both the British Empire and the foreign countries which have 
watched keenly the development of Eg^ypt from a state of anarchy to its present prosperous 
condition under Lord Cromer. 

The author states that his object in writing the book is twofold. In the first place, he 
wishes to place on record an accurate narrative of some of the principal events which have occurred 
in Egypt and in the Soudan since 1876 ; he has had access to all the documents in the Foreign 
Ofl&ces of both Cairo and London ; and has been in close communication with everyone who has 
taken a leading part in I^iyptian affairs during the period of which he writes. 

In the second place, he wishes to explain the results which have accrued to Egypt from the 
British occupation of the country in 1882. Such a showing of tangible results of twenty-five 
years' experience renders the work of tremendous value to any nation facing similiar problems 
in her own dependencies.

THU CLOSET DRAMA. 



That stern guardian of the virtues of dramatic 
art, Professor Brander Matthews, has long been 
exercised over the pretensions of the literary 
play — that is, of the play which is written to 
be read rather than to be acted. The closet 
drama, as it is frequently styled, has become 
a recognized species of our literature, and has 
acquired an important position through the emi- 
nence of those English writers who, during the 
past hundred years or so, have in part devoted 
their energies to its composition. But our critic 
will none of it ; he calls it a " bastard-hybrid " 
and other offensive names, and, not content with 
keeping it confined within its closet, he exhibits 
a ferocious desire to end its existence altogether. 
So zealous a gaoler (how he will love that spell- 
ing!) needs to be watched himself, lest his 
innocent captive be secretly done to death, or, if 
perchance its life be spared, its reputation (that 
immediate jewel of the soul) be blasted forever. 

It is against Professor Beers, in particular, 
that our knight has couched his lance, and the 
arena of the tourney is found in the February 
" North American Review," while a sort of side- 
show is provided for the entertainment of readers 
of the " Atlantic " in its issue of the same month. 
Professor Beers having rashly asserted that " the 
play house ha.«} no monopoly of the dramatic 
form," and having further expressed the opinion 
that " the English closet-drama of the nineteenth 
century is an important body of literature, of 
higher intellectual value than all the stage-plays 
produced in England during the same period," 
a challenge became inevitable, and was promptly 
delivered. The contest rages about a list 
of works that includes Byron's "Manfred," 
George Eliot's " Spanish Gypsy," Arnold's 
" Empedocles on Etna," Tennyson's " Becket," 
Browning's "Pippa Passes," Swinburne's "At- 
alanta," and Landor's " Gebir," although we do 
not quite see what the last-named epic is doing 
in cette goTere. 

These, of course, are only a few typical 
examples of the great number of works cast in 
the dramatic mould that have a secure position 
in our nineteenth-century literature. The list, 
properly amplified, would seem to the plain man 
fully to justify the claims made by Mr. Beers 



164 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



for this category of creative work. Nor does 
Mr. Matthews deny outright the importance of 
the poems in question. But he seeks to min- 
imise the sigificance of the list by eliminating 
from it two kinds of plays — those that their 
authors really hoped might be acted, and those 
that are no more than imitations of ancient 
models — and then disposing of the rest by 
remarking that they might be blotted out of ex- 
istence " without greatly impairing the renown 
of the English poets who have condescended 
to the poem in dialogue." " Condescended " is 
good, but it seems to beg the question; the 
demolition is very neat, in theory, but some- 
how it leaves "Becket" and "Atalanta" and 
" Manfred " with all their old compelling power 
upon our imagination. We recall the stage 
presentation of " Becket " as one of the most im- 
pressive we have ever seen ; we think enviously 
of the London audience that was privileged 
to witness " Atalanta " not long ago, and we 
are by no means sure that a performance of 
" Manfred" would not be the occasion of a joy- 
ous experience — its joy perhaps enhanced by 
the knowledge that it was counted illegitimate 
by the doctrinaires of dramaturgy. 

Mr. Beers reminds us that the closet drar 
matist has " a freer hand than the professional 
playwright," pointing out the obvious advan- 
tages of a form that " has not need to sacrifice 
truth of character and probability of plot to the 
need of highly accentuated situations," and that 
is not constrained to make swift development of 
dramatic action the be-all and end-all of its aim. 
The position seems to us impregnable ; certainly 
it is not carried by assault by hurling such 
epithets as " wilful perversity," " shrinking 
weakling," and " anarchists in art " at its 
defenders. Mr. Matthews is a warm admirer of 
French dramatic literature and a recognized 
authority upon the subject, but the canons of 
criticism which lead him to condemn the English 
closet-drama woidd, if logically applied, con- 
demn also the masterpieces of Corneille and 
Racine. There is no place for recits de 
Theramene in the legitimate drama as he now 
seeks to circumscribe its activities. His narrow 
definition admits Moliere alone of the three 
great Frenchmen, and leaves much of Hugo and 
Goethe, and no little of Shakespeare, in the 
outer darkness. The stage-scene in which there 
is " nothing doing " is his pet abhorrence, for he 
ignores the possibility that there may be a great 
deal " doing " in the mind of the listening spec- 
tator. For our own part, we confess to have 
derived acute pleasure from the stage deliverance 



of Faust's opening monologue, the parable of 
" Nathan der Weise," the invocation to the 
spirit of Charlemagne in " Hernani," the 
scathing denunciation of the courtiers in " Ruy 
Bias," and many a tirade of classical French 
tragedy. We might possibly balk at John 
Knox's sermon in " Bothwell," but are not quite 
sure of even that, never having been put to the 
test. And, to take the most conspicuous of 
modern instances, we would rather witness a 
performance of Ibsen's " Brand " than a wilder- 
ness of " Doll Houses " and " Hedda Gablers." 

To this point, we are prepared to defend the 
legitimacy of the stage-play that does not limit 
its effects to crisp dialogue and swiftly-moving 
action. These things are weU, but the play is 
dust and ashes that does not also provide its 
seasons of recueillement and aim at something 
more than excitement. The modem English 
stage has deliberately divorced itself from liter- 
ature, and has no reason to complain because 
literature chooses to preserve for itself whatever 
traditions and habits of the old alliance it may 
still find fitted for its purpose. That the divorce 
proceedings have been instituted by the stage is 
practically admitted by Mr. Matthews. He says : 
" The drama has cast out all that is undramatic 
and it now has no room for anything but the 
action and the characters. It is compacter than 
ever before ; and it rejects not only description 
but also narrative." Precisely so. But the poet, 
whose claim upon the dramatic form is primary, 
refuses to abandon that form to the commercial- 
ized mercies of the stage-manager, and, with 
strange perversity, refuses also to write for the 
stage under such limitations. The great Greeks 
and the great Frenchmen and the great Ger- 
mans and the great Englishmen of our one great 
dramatic epoch found the stage a suitable place 
for both description and narrative, and the 
modern Englishman who seeks to follow in their 
footsteps, although he would willingly make 
some concessions to stagecraft, is completely 
alienated by the non possumus attitude of the 
manager. Thus freed to follow his own devices, 
he produces literature that is dramatic in sem- 
blance, but that takes little thought of exits and 
entrances and stage groupings, or of histrionism 
in general. His work is given to the world in 
the form of " The Cenci," or of " Count Julian, ' 
or of " Philip van Artevelde," and this is the 
closet drama the right of which to exist Mr. 
Matthews so stoutly denies. 

Our critic speaks no more than the truth 
when he says that " behind every appearance of 
the closet drama we can discover a latent con- 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

tempt for the actual theatre," but few will 
follow him in discovering as well " a desire to 
claim its rewards." It may be held as a pious 
opinion by the closet dramatist that the ideally- 
constituted theatre of sbme Utopian realm would 
reward his work in the measure of its beauty 
and truth, but he knows full well that his own 
audience will be one of readers only, and that 
his own rewards (materially viewed) will come 
from royalties on books and not on productions. 
The stage conditions of the last half -century or 
more have been so utterly discouraging to the 
serious English writer of dramatic bent that he 
has taken the only course befitting his dignity, 
and has written his plays for print alone. He 
has missed thereby the tribute of nightly 
applause in the playhouse, but he has cherished 
instead the consoling thought that his work had 
a fair chance of living as a part of English liter- 
ature. And that is the one thing not likely to 
be asserted concerning the English plays of the 
same period that have borne, however triumph- 
antly, the test of the footlights. 



PERSONALITY VS. WORK. 

There is a story of a ship sailing north which 
sights a huge black rock and in an instant all its nails 
and iron-work are drawn out and the vessel falls 
into pieces. Contemporary literary criticism makes 
shipwreck on the magnetic rock of personality. It 
cannot keep its steerage way or bearings, or even stay 
afloat, when confronted by a dominating character. 

At first glance it would seem a matter of indiffer- 
ence to the world as to what manner of being it is 
who presents it with a work of art. We do not 
inquire of our butchers and bakers and candlestick- 
makers whether they have red hair and bandy legs, 
or a Bluebeard closet full of wives, or drain the 
flowing bowl in their leisure moments. All such 
facts, if true of literary genius, doubtless have a 
subtle influence on its work. But it is difficult to 
trace such influence out. The criticism of gossip, 
of which Sainte-Beuve was the great modern master, 
fails utterly to explain the inexplicable genesis of 
literary creation. It ignores the inspiration, the 
gift, the unknown power of intellect and feeling 
which makes all the difference between one man 
and another. The experience of a genius is paral- 
leled by that of myriads of his fellows. His ability 
to change this experience into artistic creations is 
his own. 

Biography is one of the most fascinating forms 
of literatiu-e, and the biographies of men of letters 
are the best of all. When they are both dismissed 
from life's stage the man of action must yield pre- 
cedence to the man of thought. A handful of songs 
can sanctify a whole region ; the birthplace of a 



great romance writer can draw curious crowds whom 
a battlefield would leave cold. The danger is that 
our interest in the makers of literature themselves 
is likely to take the place of interest in their work. 
We make pilgrimages to the places where they dwelt, 
and leave their books unread ; we handle the relics 
of their material life, and forget to be stirred or 
raised by their spiritual revelations ; we talk to rags 
the circumstances of Shelley's life, while " Adonais " 
and " Prometheus Unbound " sleep on the shelf ; 
we discuss Poe's inebriety, and forget his art. This 
might be thought the flattery of fame were it not 
that scandal is our usual quest. We dig in the dirt 
like pigs that have been trained to hunt for truffles. 
Antiquity knew nothing of this insatiate curiosity. 
It usually gave its poets and thinkers about as many 
lines of biography as we give volumes. The huge 
monuments of poetry and philosophy rose in sight 
of everyone, while the men who reared them were 
but a name. 

But the personality of writers affects contempo- 
raries not by the means of biography, but by actual 
presence, — by rumor or report or by a sort of aura 
which envelops their works. And this personality 
may be attractive, repellant, or neutral. 

The attractive personality in literature wins his 
place in human regard by a variety of methods. 
Sometimes he is the mere voice of the crowd — the 
personification of its passing moods and desires. He 
sees, perhaps a little earlier than the rest of man% 
kind, what winds and tides are like to prevail, and 
steers and spreads his sail for them. He seems to 
lead, though in reality he follows, like the rest, the 
impulse of the hour. He is the exponent of the 
Zeitgeist, and as such very often does a noble and 
important work. And he is always valuable his- 
torically as indicating the direction and interests of 
tlie human mind at any given time. Probably the 
greater number of the heirs of fame are of this kind. 
They are the favorites of fortune. Like the brazen 
gate fronting the sun, they receive and render back 
its rays. Popular poets, novelists, rhetoricians in 
religion or politics, are all of this kind. The danger 
they are exposed to is of a too easy success which 
relaxes the fibre of heroic effort. Their view of life 
is likely to be shallow and trivial. Or the Zeitgeist 
of the new age eats up the Zeitgeist of the last, and 
they are forgotten. 

Of a somewhat similar kind are the reformers in 
literature — who, coming at a time when one good 
custom has corrupted the world, when the gods have 
hardened into idols, when formalism has replaced 
spirituality, gather a revolting crowd about them, 
burst into the sacred places, and smash the images. 
Such iconoclasts, if successful, win an even more 
enthusiastic regard and a greater reward than they 
who burn incense to the deities in power. A com- 
mon danger binds their followers to them, and their 
courage makes them kings. The revolt of Words- 
worth and his comrades against the conventional in 
English literature, and that of Hugo and Dumas in 
French, are cases in point.

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



A minor kind of personality which achieves pop- 
ularity is that of the humorist who does not presume. 
A writer who makes himself the subject of his own 
satire, who tacitly assumes the superiority of his 
readers or audience, is sure to please. The public, 
proud of patronizing, takes such a personality under 
its protection. Such humility may be a very noble 
thing, and when allied with great intellectual power 
exercises a rightful charm. " I will speak harm of 
no one save myself of whom I know the most ill," 
is one of Shakespeare's sweetest speeches. Most of 
the humorists who have won the hearts of their con- 
temporaries have been deeply imbued with this 
feeling. One only needs to name Goldsmith, Lamb, 
and Irving. 

Once in a great while a personality appears in 
literature of such beauty, splendor, or stateliness as 
to attract all eyes and enthrone himself in the admi- 
ration of mankind. In spite of envy and hatred 
which try to do him wrong, general opinion doffs its 
cap to him. The world seems to recognize in him 
a daemonic character lifted above the ordinary levels 
of life. It sees in him an incarnation of power and 
success. Modem Europe has perhaps produced no 
more than two men of this kind — Goethe and 
Byron. Voltaire and Swift exercised almost as 
great a personal influence, but they lacked nearly 
all the gifts of nature and fortune which those fav- 
ored two possessed. 

* Counterfeit presentments of personality there 
always are in plenty. Many authors and artists, for 
advertising purposes, adopt eccentricities of dress or 
manner or character. But such masquerades do not 
mean much. 

The repellant personalities, — the men of genius 
who in life excite the active dislike of their fellows, 
who are reviled, persecuted, banished, — number in 
their ranks many of the greatest names in literature. 
They are the high and haughty souls, who, confident 
in their own strength, hold aloof from mankind. 
They are the logicians who syllogize hateful truths. 
They are the satirists and dealers in irony. Irony — 
the appearance of things propitious, the reality of 
things malign — seems to excite the anger of man- 
kind even more than satire or disdain. 

^schylus, Dante, and Milton are the great 
exemplars of the kind of genius whose soul is as a 
star and dwells apart. Their contemporaries were 
very willing to have them keep theii* distance, and 
helped them to do so by persecution and exile. In 
all such cases of misunderstanding the pity is to be 
divided between the great figure and his puny 
fellows. Human beings have their inevitable duties, 
joys, sorrows, and sins. They tend to drag down- 
ward into the darkness and resent being spurred 
upward into the light. They look to their literary 
chiefs for sympathy and flattery, and they hate the 
clarion call which rouses them to high endeavor. 
Yet when GuUiver appears in Lilliput what can he 
make of the pygmy multitude ? The little messes 
which satisfy their appetites, the little round of duties 
which occupy their days, the toys which satisfy their 



ambitions, — what are these to him ? A type of 
genius, higher yet, perhaps, than that possessed by 
the prophetic souls I have named, has known how 
to reconcile the infinitely great and the immeasur- 
ably little. But it has been at the cost, wliich 
Dante or Milton would not pay, of sinking its own 
individuality. 

The masters of the ironic strain in literature have 
been driven to many devices to get any acceptance 
at all from their audiences. Aristophanes and 
Rabelais disguised their mockery in filth, yet it is 
diffictilt to believe that either of them was personally 
popular. Defoe wrote an ironical essay on " An 
Easy Way with Dissenters " which was taken for 
a plain straightforward proposition. Probably noth- 
ing did so much to fix the charge of brutality upon 
Swift as his suggestion for the economical utilization 
of Irish infants. 

The most mysterious instance of a great character 
made repellant to his countrymen by subtle irony is 
that of Cervantes. Here was a hero among heroes, 
an Hidalgo among Hidalgos, — one almost, to borrow 
a fine phrase about a more sacred personage, " the 
first true gentleman who ever lived." He was dow- 
ered with sweetness, gentleness, fortitude, patience. 
His motto was "Patience, and shuffle the cards." 
Yet he got few honors and scant reward from his 
native land. The stately Spaniard, accustomed to 
being flattered to the top of his bent by Lope and 
Calderon, must have felt that Cervantes was laugh- 
ing in his sleeve at him. And so he thrust aside 
the poet who was the incarnation of Spanish courage 
and courtesy and loftiness of soul. 

In one of Keats's most brilliant letters he says 
that the characteristic of the highest type of literary 
genius is to have no character at all. It must have 
no decided domineering force of its own which might 
interfere with its receptivity to outward impressions. 
Keats speaks of himself as having been overwhelmed 
by the personality of a chUd. The neutral per- 
sonages of literature are undoubtedly thus made. 
They sink themselves in their work. They go about 
the world, as it were, incognito, watching the pas- 
sions and humors of men, and passively reflecting 
like a mirror the phenomena of nature and human- 
ity. They are like Apollo among the shepherds of 
Admetus, like Haroun al-Raschid prowling about the 
streets of Bagdad in disguise. Of course, back of 
this seeming passivity of impression, is the mighty 
mind always at work combining and recreating. 
And this mind is so mighty, so conscious of its 
divine power, that it is indifferent to the outward 
accidents which befall it. How should the man who 
was meditating " King Lear " feel any personal con- 
cern in the intrigues and bustle of the life about him I 
How should he care whether he had precedence at 
Court or place in the ranks of the nobles of the day ! 
How should the man who had created Rosalind and 
Imogen care whether this maid of honor or that city 
dame smiled upon him or not! We know that he 
did care to a certain extent for such things, but it is 
doubtful whether his interest was deep enough to

make him exert his energies in actual life. Possibly 
the reason we know so little about him is that there 
was little to know — that he strove with none, for 
none was worth his strife. Certainly he made no 
effort to impress his personality upon his contem- 
poraries. He laughed and drank with his fellows, 
helped them to their triumphs, accepted good- 
naturedly his eclipse by Ben Jonson and Fletcher — 
because, in all probability, he was the only man in 
that day conscious of the greatness of his work. Can 
we doubt that Homer, the man, whoever he was, 
who fused the legends and traditions of the Greek 
race into one splendid and vital whole, was a being 
of the same order ? We know that Virgil, the per- 
fect artist, was, for we have glimpses of him, shy 
and secluded, careless of his surroundings, indiffer- 
ent as to his place in Roman society while he was 
brooding over the dream which was to make Rome 
immortal. Horace probably impressed himself a 
hundred times as much upon the people about him. 
Great is the power of personality, — pervasive its 
charm when it pleases, dreadful its doom when it 
does not. But, in the main, it is only a temporary 
force in literature. It speedily fades into tradition 
or else solidifies into biography, which is a new lit- 
erary creation. Character is the scaffolding by 
means of which the houses and palaces and temples 
of art are erected. When these are done, — unless 
the architecture is bad indeed, — it is fitting that the 
beams and timbers which helped in the building 
should be taken down and the structures themselves 
revealed to view. The work is, after all, the thing. 
Personality is an uncertain quantity — the subject 
of conjecture and interpretation. But work is sure 
and lasting in its effect — as lasting as the human 
nature it depicts, as the generations of men who 
enjoy it. And it is apprizable. The great produc- 
tions of literature can be brought from the four 
quarters of the world, from the utmost distances of 
time, set side by side and judged and placed and 
ranked. Charles Leonard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The endless possibilities of library improve- 
ment, even in the best of our libraries, and the unceasing 
demands for more money with which to realize these 
possibilities, make one aware that the public library is 
still evolving — has by no means yet reached the stage 
of stagnant perfection. While Dr. Steiner, of the Enoch 
Pratt Free Library, of Baltimore, rejoices in the pros- 
pect of new branch libraries to add to the present eight, 
and to be paid for out of Mr. Carnegie's recent gener- 
ous half-million-dollar gift, he nevertheless longs for a 
larger and better-appointed central building. In the 
matter of reading-room alone, he is reported as saying: 
" I would like to enlarge it and divide it into depart- 
ments. I would like to make its accommodations greater 
and better, and I would like to break it up into ' chil- 
dren's,' « student's,' ' general,' and ' shelf ' rooms." Each 
of these rooms are described by him as he sees them in 
his mind's eye, and of the last-named he says : " When 



I speak of a • shelf ' room I mean one where the books 
are on the walls vmconfined, to be taken by the reader 
without application to an attendant. This worthy could 
sit at a little wicket by the door to see that nothing was 
stolen. Such a room as this would offer the advantages 
of freedom and wide selection. It is often very annoying 
to have to go through the formalities that are now in 
existence here to get books. It quite interrupts your 
thought sometimes, and puts you out of humor for a 
long while. Then, when you get what you have applied 
for, often you don't want it. A hasty glance through 
the contents convinces you that they are worthless. 
Then you have to order again and lose much time in the 
process. All this could be avoided in a ' shelf ' room 
where you could get what you wanted when you wanted 
it, and where you could be sure always of what you 
were getting." Careful selection and frequent change 
of books thus exposed would be necessary, as Dr. Steiner 
goes on to explain; and further: "The visitors to such 
a sanctum would have to be of a class that valued books 
and that read really for the pleasure of reading, and not 
for the sake of spending a boresome half-hour. I would 
regard the place as the choicest part of the library — a 
sort of holy of holies, where individuals of kindred taste 
could meet on a sure high ground." Would that these 
plans might be carried out! Baltimore deserves better 
things at the hands of its appropriations committee ; for 
whereas, in 1906, Chicago devoted $300,000 to library 
uses, Boston $325,550, and Pittsburgh $200,000, Bal- 
timore's appropriation has for twenty-two years not 
exceeded $50,000. . . . 

A COCKPIT FOR LITERARY COMBATS has been play- 
fully proposed by that fertile-brained, indefatigable, 
always suggestive writer on all things in heaven and 
earth, and a few besides, — Mr. Andrew Lang. He 
suggests that " if a capitalist of disinterested character 
could be enlisted," a special paper, " The Cockpit," 
might be established for the frcQ discussion and final 
adjustment of differences between authors and critics. 
" I remember," he says (in the London " Morning 
Post") in some remarks leading up to this suggestion, 
" meeting Mr. Browning once, when he was in an indig- 
nant mood. A critic, a very eminent, courteous, and 
honorable critic, had reviewed his new poem, had 
printed extracts, and had complained that they were 
very obscure. No wonder, for the critic had inadvert- 
ently misprinted them so as to render them wholly 
unintelligible. I could not convince Mr. Browning, who 
did not know the reviewer, that the error, though de- 
plorable, was accidental. Now, would Mr. Browning 
have been to blame if he had drawn the reviewer's atten- 
tion to the correct text of his verses ? Then the blimder 
would have been acknowledged, with apologies. This 
was a very unusual case, in belles-lettres. In historical 
and scientific matter I cannot but think that discussion 
is valuable to author, critic, and readers. If the critic 
is in the wrong, why should the author, in dignified 
sulks, leave him and his readers in the dark ? It is all 
very well to talk about ' waitmg the verdict of time and 
of science.' But their wheels move so slowly that they 
need to be accelerated, and they may be accelerated by 
discussion. There is, indeed, no other method. Suppose 
that the critic, however plausible his argument may 
seem, is in the wrong, and that the author can prove it. 
To remain in the wrong is the last thing that the critic 
desires. Yet perhaps nobody but the author can put 
him in the right, and, for want of discussion, he may 
carry his gray hairs to the grave under a misapprehen-

sion of Xavili Athanasianism, while the world may be 
equally deceived, sharing his illusion." Very sane and 
sensible. So long as all acrimony, all personal feeling, 
can be kept out of such discussions between authors and 
critics, they are to be encouraged, in the interests of 
truth and fairness. " Answering back," on the other 
hand, only leaves a bitter taste in the mouth; and though 
it sometimes seems to contribute to the gaiety of nations, 
the mirth aroused is Satanic.

The eloquent shrug of Omar Khayyam may 
not be familiar to all readers. In his recent American 
visit Mr. William Archer was congratulated by a young 
actress on the never-failing fairness of his reviews — a 
fairness difficult for a dramatic critic, or any critic, to 
maintain. " To be fair," said Mr. Archer, " is some- 
times hard and cruel, and sometimes it is rash. The 
unswervingly fair critic often takes up his pen with 
the shrug of Omar, the old Persian poet. You have 
heard of Omar's shrug ? No ? Well, it was eloquent. 
The Shah one day sent for the old poet. ' Omar,' said 
he, ' I have written some verses. Listen and I will 
read them to you.' And he read the verses, and in the 
ensuing silence looked at Omar anxiously. * Well ? ' he 
said. ' Heaven-born,' replied Omar gently, ' each to his 
own calling. Sceptre in hand, you are most wise, just, 
and powerful ; but pen in hand — ' Omar shook his 
head. ' Heaven-born,' he continued, ' such verses would 
disgrace a nine-year-old schoolboy.' His eyes flashing 
with rage, the Shah shouted to his guards: *To the 
stables with this old fool, and let him be soundly 
flogged.' Yet the Shah, for all that, respected Omar's 
judgment, and a week later he sent for the fearless and 
fair critic again. ' Another poem, Omar,' he said. ' A 
better one, I 'm sure you '11 think it is a better one,' he 
added wistfully. And he began to read the second 
poem to the old man. But in the middle of the reading 
Omar turned and started for the door. ' Where are 
you going ? ' demanded the Shah in amazement. Omar 
looked back and shrugged his shoulders. ' To the 
stables,' he answered, ' for another flogging.' " And did 
this would-be poet then comfort himself with repeating 
those scornful words of another merciless flogger of 
critics, — " as soon seek roses in December, ice in June, 
hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff, believe a 
woman or an epitaph, or any other thing that 's false, 
before you trust in critics " ? Probably the Shah was 
guilty of no such anachronism, Byron and the " English 
Bards" being still some seven hundred years in the 
futiire. ... 

The old-fashioned librarian, who has been made 
the subject of some recent comment and correspondence 
in our pages, is again discussed by the editor of the lib- 
rary department of the Boston " Transcript." Instead 
of answering directly our correspondent's complaint of 
the decay of the literature-loving custodian of books, the 
Boston writer thinks it better, as he says, " to quote a 
few sentences from that storehouse of information con- 
cerning the maimers and customs of the librarian of a 
past generation — that rare old work, ' The Old Libra^- 
rian's Almanac' " So delicious is the flavor of the 
passage that it must be here reprinted in full. " You 
shall chuse your Books with Care and Circumspection. 
When you have determiu'd that it is Prudent to pur- 
chase a certain Work, do so cautiously and make a 
Shrewd Bargain with the Vendor. It will then be your 
Duty to Peruse the Volume, even if (as doubtless will 
be the Fact) you have scan'd it before Buying. Do not 



let the Importunities of Persons who come to the Library 
hasten you in the Performance of this Task. They 
should be Content to wait for the Book until you have 
Satisfied yourself of its Contents. There will then 
remain the Necessity of recording its Acquisition in 
your Ledgers of Record. As for the Entry of its Style 
and Title in the Catalogue, many coimsel that this is not 
needful, since you may be expected to remember that 
the Book has been Purchas'd for the Library. Some 
would advise that if it be a volume of Sermons it be 
placed on the Shelves with others of its like ; or if it be 
a work of Natural Philosophy it stand near the volumes 
of that class. This is a waste of Labour. Assign it a 
Number which shall Correspond to its Position on the 
Shelf, and shall be the next in sequence from the latest 
Book which you have added, and so let them stand in 
the order in which they are Receiv'd. For, surely, if 
you desire to find a number of volumes of Sermons, it 
wUl be an easy matter for you, recalling when they 
were Purchas'd, to pluck them from their several 
resting-places. Keep your Books behind stout Gratings, 
and in no wise let any Person come at them to take them 
from the shelf except yourself " We have heard of a 
librarian who, to insure his tenure of office, refused to 
issue a catalogue of the collection in his charge. He 
must have been a faithful reader of " The Old Librarian's 
Almanac." ... 

Chicago as a centre for library extension has 
advantages that were recognized by the League of State 
Library Commissions at its mid-winter meeting in this 
city. On that occasion the following resolution was 
passed: "Inasmuch as a possible transfer of American 
Library Association headquarters has been under con- 
sideration by the council and executive board, and 
inasmuch as the greatest profit which can be derived 
through national headquarters is in furtherance of lib- 
rary extension, it is hereby declared the sense of those 
present at this League of Library Commissions that such 
headquarters ought to be located with special reference 
to the extension of library interests in those sections of 
the country where efforts promise the greatest possibili- 
ties. We therefore respectfully submit for the con- 
sideration of the executive committee the advisability of 
selecting Chicago as the location for American Library 
Association headquarters. The central location of 
Chicago affords greater convenience of access to a 
larger number of the members of the American Librai-y 
Association than any other city under consideration, and 
the fact that it is the natural gathering point in the 
region which is likely to prove in the next decade the 
chief seat of library extension gives added force to the 
argument for its selection." Although the centre of 
population is now considerably to the eastward of 
Chicago, that centre is steadily moving westward, and 
thus Chicago is likely for a long time to come to prove 
an increasingly desirable situation for the proposed 
headquarters. ... 

The press and the people stand in a close and 
curious relation to each other. In a current magazine 
article on " The Newspaper as it is," by Gen. Charles H. 
Taylor of the Boston "Globe," he says: "Our papers 
are what the people make them. The public decides 
what it wishes to read; the editors and publishers, 
trained in their business, gather their raw material and 
work it into the finished product, news, to meet the 
demand." We protest that this is putting journaUsm 
on a level with manufactures. The law of supply and

demand cannot, of course, be ignored by a journal that 
has to be self-supporting; but no great editor has ever 
let his readers lead him by the nose. Did Greeley or 
Bryant or Dana let the people piake their respective 
papers for them ? No journalist is worthy of his calling 
who simply lays his ear to the ground and then writes 
what he hears the populace clamoring for. But General 
Taylor rises to higher levels in a succeeding paragraph, 
in which he well says: " Journalists have a much heavier 
responsibihty than any other business men. The idle, 
the self-seeking, the untruthful, the vicious, beguile them 
at every hand, to use the powerful engine of the press to 
carry them a little way along their chosen road. The 
editor must watch ceaselessly for these unwelcome 
passengers and eject them on sight. He appreciates 
the responsibility of his trust. He reaches his ideal as 
nearly as he can, and does far more for the morals of 
the community than he is usually given credit for." 
Some conception of the influence of the press may be 
formed from the fact that there were last year pub- 
lished in this country alone 21,535 periodicals of all 
kinds, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.; and from recent 
statistics it is estimated by General Taylor that the total 
circulation of the newspapers of the country in 1907 was 
not less than ten billion copies. Another significant fact 
is that the world's issue of papers in the English lan- 
guage exceeds that of all others combined. 

A GUIDE TO CURRENT FRENCH BOOKS, authoritative, 
and presumably " safe " for use in buying for family or 
public library purposes, seems to have been discovered by 
Mr. George F. Bowermau, librarian of the Washington 
Public Library, in the course of a recent study of the 
eighty-two free popular libraries scattered through the 
twenty wards (arrondissments) of Paris His paper on 
" The Municipal Popular Libraries of Paris," read be- 
fore the District of Columbia Library Association last 
October, published in " The Library Journal " of Jan- 
uary, and now reprinted and issued as a separate leaflet, 
contains much interesting information on French public 
libraries. Its wealth of matter cannot be squeezed 
into a paragraph; therefore we will simply add a few 
more words about the book-list referred to above. Mr. 
Bowerman says : " One of the most interesting features 
of this library system [of Paris], and the one which will, 
perhaps, afford most practical help to American public 
libraries, is that which has to do with the choice of books. 
One of the most important functions of the central 
commission is the annual publication of a list of books 
accepted as suitable for these mimicipal libraries. It is 
from these lists that all accessions to the various libra- 
ries must be chosen." The list for 1907 contained 273 
titles, besides periodicals, fiction covering 52 titles; 
" literature," 51 ; sciences, art, and education, 49 ; history, 
geography, and travel, 66 ; and other branches a lesser 
number. Advance requests for copies of these annual 
lists would probably receive courteous consideration. 
At present the number printed is limited. M. Rupert 
Pr^cy, Chief of the Central Service of Municipal Li- 
braries, appears from Mr. Bowerman's paper to be the 
proper official to approach.

The YELLOWNESS OF YELLOW JOURNALISM is learn- 
edly discussed in a current magazine article by Professor 
W. I. Thomas of Chicago University. He argues, with 
a considerable use of the psychological laboratory termi- 
nology, that " the yellow feature of journalism " owes 
its existence to " the interest attaching to the disastrous. 



If a yellow sheet be analyzed, it will be foimd that it 
handles events and persons from the pain or disaster 
standpoint. The event itself is of no significance. The 
loss of life, the loss of happiness, the loss of property, 
the loss of reputation, death and detraction, is the whole 
story. In a word, it is an appeal to the hate reflex." 
This elemental savage instinct, to which, as well as to 
other primitive and often tmlovely instincts, man owes 
his survival, is probably at the bottom of that irrational 
and indefensible exultation that is not seldom felt in the 
misfortunes of others, even though those others be 
neighbors, friends, or even near relatives. La Roche- 
foucauld's pithy expression of this sad tendency of 
frail humanity is placed at the head of Professor 
Thomas's article. He defends his thesis rather con- 
vincingly, but fails, it must seem to many readers, to 
attach enough importance to that mere, idle, good- 
natured curiosity, that insatiable hunger for something 
new, that prompts many a kind-hearted and well-meaning 
person to buy the Uveliest, most sensationally-headlined 
newspaper his penny will procure. Human nature 
cannot be so utterly corrupt that we go about thirsting 
for the blood and eager for the shame of our fellow-men 
with quite such avidity as Professor Thomas would have 
us believe. , » , 

Of INTEREST TO DICTIONARY-BUYERS and dictionary- 
sellers is a little leaflet, sent out by the G. & C. Merriam 
Company, publishers of Webster's dictionaries, wherein 
is given in full the late decision of the United States 
Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of said company 
against George W. Ogilvie, also a publisher of diction- 
aries. Though imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, 
Mr. Ogilvie's emulous patterning of his own dictionary 
after the model furnished by the Messrs. Merriam, and 
especially his manifest admiration of these gentlemen's 
taste in the matter of title-page and covers and label, 
have proved a species of blandishment inoperative on 
that love of adulation which he evidently, and most 
naturally, had counted on as existent in the bosoms of 
the Merriam brothers. And, worst of all, the Court of 
Appeals has shown itself as little genial in this respect 
as the Merriams; for, to quote from the leaflet's sum- 
mary of the decision, " it reverses the decision of the 
Circuit Court, rendered a year ago, orders an injunction 
against the further sale of Ogilvie's dictionary with the 
title-page and covers ' in the present form, or in any 
form calculated to deceive members of the public into 
purchasing his dictionary under the belief that it is a 
Merriam Webster's Dictionary,' and remands the case 
to the Circuit Court to pass upon the question of an 
accounting for the profits upon dictionaries which have 
been sold by Ogilvie up to this date." 

Statesmanship and the love of poetry are often 
found happily conjoined. Instances of apt quotations 
from the poets, manifestly impromptu and in quick reply 
to an opponent, on the floor of the British Parliament, 
and, less often, in our own congressional halls, would 
fill a book, or at least a small one. Another proof of 
the affinity for classic poetry that is sometimes felt by 
the man engaged in public legislative, administrative, or 
judicial pursuits was furnished, in his old age, by the 
fourteenth Earl of Derby, who occupied the leisure of 
his later years in turning Homer's " Iliad " into blank 
verse. Almost half a century before, it is worth noting, 
he had gained the Chancellor's Latin verse prize at 
Oxford, his subject being "Syracuse." Ex-Secretary

Governor Long, beguiled the tedium of a summer vaca- 
tion (or was it several summers, and some winters 
besides ?) by making a metrical translation of the 
" ^neid." And now there has just appeared, from the 
pen of the Rt. Hon. Sir S. W. Griffith, Chief Justice of 
the Australian Commonwealth, a new English version, 
in the metre of the original, of Dante's never-to-be-

spectacle as it would be to see philosophers ruling over 
the nations is it to behold poets and the translators of

The oldtime spelling bee is expected to buzz with 
renewed energy now that one Varnum Lincohi, late of 
Andover, Mass., has bequeathed to his native town the 
sum of five hundred dollars to found a perpetual spell- 
ing match. Once a year, according to the terms of the 
will, this contest in orthography shall be held in some 
public hall or place near the centre of the town, at or 
near the close of the winter term of the public schools. 
It must be conducted under the care and supervision of 
the school committee of the town, the public to be 
admitted free of charge. The contestants must be 
between the ages of ten and eighteen years, and the 
ancient method of " choosing sides " must be followed. 
Prizes of ten, six, and four dollars are to be given to the 
three best spellers. So far, so good; but why did not 
the testator provide against time-wasting disputes and 
much possible hard feeling by stipulating that his old- 
fashioned spelling bee should follow the old-fashioned 
spelling ? A town divided against itself — one faction 
clinging to Webster, and the rest blown about by every 
wind of doctrine in the matter of spellmg — would be a 
harrowing spectacle. Manifestly, Mr. Varnum Lincoln 
did not rise to the level of his opportunity.

Aluminum for books for the blind is the latest 
application of that light and attractive metal. It is 
rolled into thin sheets and embossed, in the same way 
that paper is embossed, with the raised characters used 
for the blind. Aluminum books are now being printed 
in Edinburgh, and they are said to be easier to read than 
paper books; moreover, they do not soil with handling, 
and they are practically indestructible. The one draw- 
back is the expense of manufacture. Before these books 
shall have been brought within the more general reach 
of the blind it is to be hoped that the blind, or their 
teachers, will unite on some one alphabet, out of the 
several now in use. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



"THE OLD-FASHIONED LIBRARIAN" ONCE MORE. 
(To the Editor of The Dla.l.) 

In addition to the very courteous reply which Mr. 
Arthur L. Bailey made to my letter appearing in The 
Dial of February 1, there have been a number of other 
responses, through personal notes and in public print, 
some gratefully sympathetic, others ebullitions worthy 
of a greater problem. These latter, one and all, mis- 
read my letter and charge me, to use the words of 
the Boston " Transcript," with " bringing out the old- 
fashioned librarian to squeak and gibber for a season." 

This I was very careful not to do, knowing the 



sensitiveness of some librarians to the phrase, and also 
having repeatedly read the passage quoted again by the 
" Transcript," regarding the curmudgeon of olden time 
who kept his books under rusty lock and key. 

My suggestion was a very simple one, growing out 
of an experienced need and from visits to a number of 
small libraries, in more than one of which untrained 
book-lovers were doing acceptable work. I don't for 
a moment doubt that these same people would do better 
work if they were graduated from some good library 
school ; but, conditions being as they are — and no one 
has charged tliat I misstated them — the best graduates 
of the library schools very naturally accept positions 
where they have the minimum amount of merely me- 
chanical work to do. In many cases, then, this leaves 
the mechanical graduate — who, of course, is not a 
product peculiar to library schools — for the remaining 
positions. 

Many helps have already been furnished for the 
untrained, and my suggestion was that correct classifi- 
cation, the stumbling block for trained and untrained 
alike, should be furnished also from some competent 
source. Then the trustees of a small library would be 
enabled to employ a person fitted by tastes and culture 
for the position, whenever and wherever they could find 
him. It has seemed to some that such a person, aided 
by the technical helps available, would give better ser- 
vice than the poorer graduates of any school. 

I am glad to state that a publishing house closely 
identified with library interests has already announced 
that it will soon be prepared to furnish such classifica- 
tion as I suggested. Thomas H. Briggs.

MORE DEFINITIONS OF "GAWMING" OR 
" GORMING." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I have read with interest the communication of Mr. 
Roswell Field in the issue of The Dial for March 1, 
with reference to the word " gawming." I, too, recall 
that in my boyhood the word was in frequent use in 
Connecticut. The verb was commonly spelled " gorm," 
and so far as I remember was used only in the sense of 
" to smear and render sticky." In the Century Dic- 
tionary both " gorm " and " gawm " are described as the 
same as " gaum," to which are given distinct meanings. 
The first definition includes " to care for; heed; observe; 
to understand; consider ; distinguish "; another definition 
is " to smear as with anything sticky (perhaps a variation 
of gum)." Following this definition is the derivative 
meaning, "to handle clumsily; paw." The use of the 
word in all these senses is described as provincial En- 
glish. The Standard Dictionary gives the like definitions 
with a similar attribution. It seems to me that the defi- 
nition quoted from Colonel Higginson's article on " The 
Migration of Words," — " awkward, lubberly," comes 
from the derivative meaning of the word " gaum " — 
" to handle clumsily." It also seems to me that the 
meaning of the expression " gorming about," which Mr. 
Field gives as " looking about in a clownish and aimless 
manner,' is a mistaken meaning; that expression being 
apparently derived from one of the definitions of the 
word "gaum," as first described, that is "to observe." 
The unusual occurrence of the word must account, I 
suppose, for the evident confusion of meanings in its 
use this side of the Atlantic. Howard Mansfield.

Dr. John Brown and his Friends.* 

A volume of familiar letters from the author 
of " Rab and his Friends " and " Marjorie 
Fleming " is sure to be pleasant reading. In 
a goodly octavo, his son (who, of course, con- 
tinues the long line of John Browns) and Dr. 
D. W. Forrest have edited a generous selection 
of letters to and from Dr. Brown, covering the 
half -century from 1830 to the physician-author's 
death in 1882. In the near view thus afforded 
of a tender and beautiful, rather than a brilliant 
and powerful, character the book is all that 
could have been expected, and nearly all that 
could be desired. Like all collections of letters, 
however, it naturally includes many paragraphs, 
not to say pages, dealing with little transitory 
matters of no interest in themselves, but gaining 
a significance from the reader's love of the writer. 

The father, grandfather, and great-grand- 
father of Dr. John Brown were all men of some 
mark, ministers of religion, at once saintly and 
shrewd — canny Scotchmen, in short, each a 
power in his parish, and even somewhat beyond 
— and all bore the name John, transmitted 
through how many previous generations we know 
not. Handicapped by such an apology for a 
name, " John Brown " (it might almost as well 
have been a number), these worthies were of 
necessity compelled to assert their individuality 
in some unmistakable manner, in order to avoid 
confusion with the hundreds of other contem- 
porary John Browns. And in the case of our 
John Brown, who knows but it may have been 
a fear of losing the sense of his separate identity 
that made him, serious and devout though he 
was, break with the tradition of his forefathers 
and choose medicine rather than the ministry for 
a calling ? 

This inherited strain of seriousness and piety 
reveals itself early, and somewhat amusingly, in 
a letter to the writer's brother William. From 
John, surgeon's assistant at Chatham, twenty-one 
years old, goes the following fatherly advice to 
William under the paternal roof in Edinburgh : 

" And now, my dear William, though I am 400 miles 
away from you, my thoughts are often with you, and 
they are sometimes anxious and sad, at others cheering 
and satisfying. My dear William, he assured that there 
is no real happiness where there is the indulgence iu 
guUt — that pure thoughts and upright actions as assur- 
edly and as consequently cause real happiness as the sun

light and heat. Keep this always before you; know 
the God of your fathers. Although I do not think I 
am really religious — I fear I am not — I can see from 
experience that the way of transgression is hard.'* 

Much more advice, equally excellent, follows and 
precedes this illustrative extract. The young 
writer's reference to a personal experience of 
transgression is delightful, in its way. Not so 
pleasing, in fact almost shocking, is a curiously 
unfeeling account of a surgical operation a few 
months later. Anaesthetics were stiU in the fu- 
ture ; yet no word of pity for the patient passes 
from John to WiUiam. " I took off a young 
man's arm," he writes, " on the morning the Dr. 
sailed. I found the operation ridiculously easy, 
and the whole of the stimip, with the exception 
of the comer where the ligatures hung out, 
healed prima intentione. Mr. Dods and I have 
used the actual Cautery three times, and I hope 
with success." But in surgery, as in war, 
cutting and burning get to be matters of little 
moment — the more 's the pity. More human 
and homely in its interest is the subjoined pas- 
sage from a letter to the paternal John Brown : 
" I am very desirous to see Canterbury and Dover, 
and my present plan is to go down to Canterbury by one 
of the night coaches (6/ outside) so as to be there at 4 
in the morning and in plenty of time to walk to Dover, 
distance 16 miles. After seeing it I shall walk to 
Ramsgate and Margate, and take the coach from there 
to Canterbury, where I will remaui all night, and after 
spending the next day in seeing the Cathedral, etc., 
return home to Chatham in the evening, but on this also 
I await your decision. If I were to return by the smack 
directly without being more than a day in London, £5 
would suffice, inclusive of the £2 :2 / for the Tailor's bill. 
I think I mentioned in my last that if I remained in 
London and called on any of my friends, I would require 
a new pair of trowsers. They will cost £1 :7 / ." 

Of such unheroic details are great and small 
alike compelled to take thought in this world of 
food and clothing and tailors' bills. By way of 
contrast, let us quote a few sentences addressed

open wide her eyes that I might stare into their depth. 
She will kiss nobody in the world but her father, mother, 
brothers and sisters, and me ! " 

Before passing to the later and, in a literary 
way, more important letters, it must be noted 
that even in his early professional experience at 
Chatham Dr. John Brown attained some degree 
of fame. His unselfish spending of himself at 
the time of the cholera epidemic, in 1832, was 
many years later referred to by Dickens at a 
private dinner-party in Edinburgh. The nov- 
elist, as a footnote records the incident, " told 
of the deep impression made on his mind by the 
conduct of a young Scottish doctor at Chatham 
during the cholera epidemic. He described his 
remaining with a poor woman whom all had 
deserted, ministering to her to the end, and then, 
overcome with fatigue, falling asleep, and being 
still asleep when in the morning the house was 
entered. One of the party exclaimed, ' That is 
Dr. John Brown ! ' '' 

In a letter to Lady Minto, written in 1880, 
are references to two renowned characters, one 
of whom was not then of so great renown as 
to make the recognition of his greatness a mere 
matter of course. 

" I don't wonder you like the Travels with a Donkey; 
it is just what you say of it, true genius, a new liquor, 
fresh and aromatic. . . . He is son of Thomas Stevenson, 
Civil Engineer, ' the Family Theologian,' and grandson 
bf the grand old Bell Rock man. He wrote in the 
Comhill some time ago the wisest and best words, since 
Carlyle, on Burns, on whom of late far too much has 
been written; and he has a clever little book, An Inland 
Voyage in France in a Canoe, which he made with Sir 
James Simpson's son Walter ; and he has a paper on the 
old Capital of California in this month's Fraser, full of 
charm in feeling and description. ... I met Lowell 
when here [in Edinburgh] and like him greatly — a ' full 
man,' as well knowledged as Sir Henry Taylor, but full 
also of original fun — a great poet, I think. Do you 
know him and his works well? I would much rather 
be him than Tennyson or Browning; there is more of 
the light of common day, more naturalness in thought 
and word, and no want of depth or tenderness, with 
humour of the strongest and rarest flavour. He told 
me he crossed the Atlantic with Thackeray, Clough, 
and Lowe — such a foursome ! He talked a great deal 
about Don Quixote, which I had just been slowly reading, 
and I was delighted to hear his praises. But he says 
it is dreadful to read him in English. He looks upon 
Cervantes as on the same shelf with Homer, Shakespeare, 
and Dante, primary and unapproachable." 

These letters form, and are meant by the edi- 
tors to form, an outline sketch of the writer's 
life from his own pen. To supplement them 
there are added others addressed to him, out of 
the comparatively few still preserved. Most in- 
teresting are messages from Ruskin, Thackeray, 
Gladstone, Jowett, Dean Stanlev, R. H. Hutton, 



and Mark Twain. The last-named appears to 
have been on the friendliest of terms with the 
chronicler of Rab's little history, as was only 
natural. From Elmira he writes in the summer 
of 1876 : 

" Dear Friend the Doctor — It was a perfect 
delight to see the well-known handwriting again! But 
we so grieve to know that you are feeling miserable. 
It must not last ; it cannot last. The regal summer has 
come, and it will smile you into high good cheer ; it will 
charm away your pains, it will banish your distresses. 
I wish you were here, to spend the summer with us. 
We are perched on a hill-top that overlooks a little 
world of green valleys, shining rivers, sumptuous for- 
ests, and billowy uplands veiled in the haze of distance. 
We have no neighbors. It is the quietest of all quiet 
places, and we are hermits that eschew caves and live 
in the sun. Doctor, if you 'd only come ! I will carry 
your letter to Mrs. C. now, and there will be a glad 
woman, I tell you! . . . Come over. Doctor John, and 
bring the Barclays, the Nicolsons, and the Browns, one 
and all! — Affectionately yours, 

" Saml. L. Clemens." 

Readers of the " Horae Subsecivae " will re- 
member the chapter, in the third series, on the 
" Death of Thackeray "; and to them it will be 
no surprise to find in this volume of the author's 
correspondence evidence of the warmest friend- 
ship between the two men. The Edinburgh 
physician was among the first to recognize the 
novelist's genius, and he took the lead in pur- 
chasing and sending to him, as a tribute from 
Edinburgh admirers, a handsome silver inkstand 
fashioned to represent " Mr. Punch." This 
neatly appropriate testimonial opened the way 
to a correspondence that lasted until Thackeray's 
death. The closing paragraph of a letter written 
by Thackeray in the course of his American lec- 
ture tour is not without interest. The place and 
date are " Charleston, S. C, March 25, 1853." 

" It 's all exaggeration about this country — barbar- 
ism, eccentricities, nigger cruelties, and all. They are 
not so highly educated as individuals, but a circle of 
people knows more than an equal number of English 
(of Scotch I don't say; there, in Edinburgh, you are 
educated). The negroes are happy, whatever is said 
of them, at least all we see, and the country Planters 
beg and implore any Englishman to go to their estates 
and see for themselves. I think these 4 sides of paper 
might contain all I have got to say regarding the country, 
which I can 't see for the dinners, etc. To-morrow I go 
to Richmond on my way to New York and thence into 
Canada; and in July or before, I hope to see that old 
country again which is after all the only country for us 
to live in. . . . "

The Gkeat Master of Military 
Strategy.* 



In the first two volumes of Colonel Dodge's 
Napoleon (reviewed in The Dial of September 
1, 1904), the campaigns from 1796 to 1807 
were described ; the third and fourth voliunes 
are now before us, and carry us through to the 
closing scenes of the great drama. The years 
from 1808 to 1815 are the years of Napoleon's 
decline ; the dictator of European policies from 
the raft at Tilsit was now to find himself more 
slackly followed, then stubbornly opposed, then 
persistently forced back, then crushed. Colonel 
Dodge follows every move of the Grand Army 
with keen but unbiased judgment ; he lays his 
finger on every faulty manoeuvre ; he finds in 
the waning vitality of the Emperor ample cause 
for the lapses in judgment and energy which 
a Bonaparte would never have shown ; and when 
all is said and done he finds in Napoleon the 
greatest military genius of modern times. 

The general reader, who may be presumed 
to be acquainted with the outlines of the 
Napoleonic wars, will open these massive vol- 
umes with some shrinking of spirit ; but if he 
will summon his patience and resolution, a sure 
reward will come in the deep compelling interest 
of the events themselves and in what is possibly 
his first clear comprehension of the movements 
so clearly and minutely depicted. The true way 
to feel the dramatic force of a battle or a cam- 
paign is to understand it ; and this achievement 
is within the reach of those who will read with 
care these volumes. Colonel Dodge of course 
uses the technical terms of war ; but these are 
readily learned by the lay reader, and the author 
gives him every help with maps and plans. In 
this way, what was formerly vague geographical 
suggestion becomes-accurate topography, and the 
fury and glory and terror of it all are only in- 
tensified by the statistics and the precision. 

Volume III. begins with the indecisive Span- 
ish campaigns, of 1808, in which Napoleon's 
brother Joseph and some of his generals showed 
what blunders they were capable of when away 
from the master's eye. Then come the series of 
battles along the Danube, in which Wagram 
remains the most conspicuous. Over 300 pages 
are given to the invasion of Russia in 1812 ; and 
no rhetoric is employed or needed to heighten 
the difficulties of the march to Moscow, or the 
horrors of that awful retreat. The facts and

of the Peninsular War to the Battle of Waterloo. By Theodore

trated. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



figures, as Colonel Dodge marshals them with 
passionless veracity, are enough. Moscow and 
the Beresina were the fourth act of the great 
tragedy ; Leipzig and Waterloo were the fifth. 
The account of these epoch-closing struggles 
occupies a large part of the concluding volume, 
and in it the author has put forth to the utmost 
his powers of profound investigation and lucid 
description. In regard to Waterloo, indeed, he 
would seem to have said the last word. 

" From its actual course it seems certain that, had the 
battle of Waterloo been fought out between Napoleon 
and Wellington, quite apart from expectation of aid or 
dread of interference by the Prussians, and judging by 
the many acknowledged weak spots in the British line 
of battle, it would, with the heavier masses and reserves 
properly put in by the master hand, have proved a 
French victory. . . . Napoleon's gravest mistakes were 
in not mancEuvring when Blucher was first seen, and 
later in not retiring out of action, and in putting in what 
remained of the Guard as he did, instead of using it to 
protect a retreat to the Sambre. The fatal outcome 
was primarily attributable to Napoleon's want of his old 
perspicacity. We can scarcely conceive him, in the days 
of AusterUtz or Jena, drawing from the facts he knew 
an absolute conclusion that the Prussians could not reach 
his right ; but at Waterloo he did draw this wrong con- 
clusion, acted upon it, and failed. Had he correctly 
divined Blucher's intentions he would by 1 or 2 a. m. 
have ordered in Grouchy, and he would not so long have 
put off his massed attack upon the English. The best 
work of the day was done by Lobau at Planchenoit, 
under the Emperor's eye. The Prussians had been as 
good as their word, and deserve unstinted commenda- 
tion ; and as to Wellington, no praise is too high for his 
courage in accepting battle where he did, and for his 
tactical alertness, his skill in handling his men, and his 
dogged perseverance throughout the day. As always, 
the British troops fought as they should, and the officers 
exhibited every quality that goes to make up the best 
lieutenants." 

Along with this judgment must be read the 
author's conclusion a few pages further on : 

"All criticism of Napoleon's conduct of this cam- 
paign must be read in the spirit that prompts it, the 
utmost admiration of his genius, and a desire to inquire 
why he here failed, when previously, under as difficult 
conditions, he had won. After all is said, and despite his 
last four years, Napoleon remains the greatest soldier 
of modern times; criticism of any kind must always 
result in evolving this conclusion; and every word 
spoken of his laxness here is subject to the knowledge 
that no failure can rob him of his fame as the best leader 
and broadest teacher of war of the Christian era." 

This last phrase seems to exclude Alexander, 
Hannibal, and Caesar, the three ancient ones of 
Colonel Dodge's six great captains ; and in this 
connection it is at least interesting to note his 
summary of his six heroes : 

" No doubt, taking him in his many-sidedness, Caesar 
is the greatest character in history. It may not unfairly 
be claimed that Napoleon follows next, especially in that 
he preserved for Europe many germs of the liberty

which was born of the blood of the Revolution. Csesax 
was the most useful man of antiquity ; Napoleon comes 
near to being the most useful man of modern times. 
But neither Caesar nor Napoleon appeals to us as do 
splendid, open-hearted Alexander, patient, intrepid, 
ever-constant Hannibal, the Christian hero Gustavus, and 
daring, obstinate, royal Frederick. Were we to classify 
these great captains, we might describe them thus: 
Alexander, the first teacher of systematic war ; Hannibal, 
father of strategy; Caesar, the organizer; Gustavus 
Adolphus, father of modern war; Frederick, the battle 
tactician; Napoleon, the perfect strategist." 

So long as the war-drum must throb, it is well 
that such books should be written ; and it is 
matter for honest pride that from the small Army 
list of the United States should come a man who 
could compose a series of perhaps the most ex- 
haustive military biographies of our time.

The Rejuvenation or Henry James.* 



Some people will feel when they see the 
"New York Edition" of Mr. Henry James's 
novels and tales, as some others felt when the 
" Outward Bound Edition " of Kipling appeared. 
That was (as this is) a very handsome edition, 
and something wholly proper and what one likes. 
There was a pleasure in viewing, in thinking of, 
the stately volumes, even aside from the pleasure 
of reading such good print on such good paper. 
Yet there was then, as there will be now, a touch 
of regret that those old famUiar favorites are 
to be superseded, relegated to an upper shelf or 
a row behind those with the new uniforms, put 
away. They were of different sizes and ages, 
and from different publishers, those old volumes 
of James, and probably the set was not com- 
plete — even an earnest Jamesian (shall we say ?) 
could acknowledge some gaps ; still the old vol- 
umes had charm, partly perhaps of association. 

But these are common woes, — woes that one 
may happen to feel whenever a favorite contem- 
porary is elevated to the Olympus of a definitive 
edition. There is another thing in this case, 
a loss which doubtless Mr. James feels, to parody 
Shelley, but we alone deplore. In this case we 
are not to have the dear old things as we remem- 
ber them, or even as they were. They are to 
return to us brought up to date by the author. 
K you have ever seen one you loved twenty-five 
years ago you have perhaps regretted the changes 
made in the once familiar lines by five lustres. 

*The Novels and Tales op Henry James. New York 
Edition. Vol. I.. Roderick Hudson; Vol. II., The American; 
Vols. III. and VI., The Portrait of a Lady; Vols. V. and VI., 
The Princess Casamassima. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



Here it is just the other way : we are now called 
to regret that once loved forms are rejuvenated. 
The friend of our youth has decided upon a 
golden wig. Mr. James is translating his works 
into his own dialect. At first it was hoped by 
those of older time that there would be but 
slight change, — that Mr. James would run 
through a volume as he sat over a cigar after 
dinner, and pencil on the margin a change or so. 
But such is not the case : there is hardly a page 
where he has not made half a dozen alterations. 

Such a proceeding overshadows every other 
interest connected with the edition : one cannot 
help it. Undoubtedly, at best or at worst, the 
revision is a minor matter. If we like it, it does 
not really change our net impression of the work ; 
if we do not like it, ten to one we shall hardly 
notice the difference unless we set ourselves down 
to collate. We must constantly say to ourselves, 
" It is not important," — but we cannot help 
thinking of it and talking of it. Because, of 
course, the recent James is so different from the 
Henry James, Jr., of our youth. " So different, 
yes, and so much better ! " cry the neo-Jamesians, 
the recent converts. " Would you have stopped 
Tennyson's revision and re-revision ? " 

" No," say the Irreconcileables, those who 
read " The Portrait of a Lady " with the fevers 
and pulses of youth, and strove unto death with 
somnolence over " The Wings of a Dove." " No, 
[say they] we would prevent no one else from 
doing as he may choose. We would stop one 
thing only, just this one, this unique person from 
doing this one unique thing." The thing is done, 
however, and done thoroughly ; and if the irre- 
concileable will not like it, the only thing to do 
is to shut oneself up with the older editions and 
forget the modern world, or else to confine one- 
seK to " The Spoils of Poynton " and such other 
thino:s as Mr. James leaves outside the fold. 

The fact that the present edition gives us a 
revised text is really of something more than the 
sentimental interest alluded to. As he went on 
in life Mr. James changed his ideas of material 
and his ideas of expression. His interests in life 
seemed to turn, not unnaturally, into directions 
neglected before, and which many of his ad- 
mirers would have themselves been contented 
still to neglect. His feeling for expression 
became more precise, more refijied, perhaps even 
more delicate. He became in some respects 
more modern, — or more accurately he remained 
modern. But chiefly he strove to get closer to 
the texture, the movement, of his own thought, 
and to give his readers a more delicate sense of 
his conception than had been possible before. 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



175 



It was a fine ideal. " Rien que la nuance ! " says 
Paul Verlaine, " toute le reste est litterature." 
Mere literature Mr. James's volumes would 
never have become, and yet we cannot think him 
wrong for pursuing assiduously the fleeting good 
that mocked him with the view. Others have 
done the same thing, notably Walter Pater : 
toward the end of his life those who had read 
" The Renaissance " with passion were at some 
pains to comprehend, even, " Plato and Plato- 
nism." Mr. James also became crabbed when, 
perhaps, he meant to be clear, or at least exact. 

Thus it really is something of a question 
whether it was worth while to re- write his novels. 
There can be little doubt that Mr. James wrote 
better English thirty years ago than he writes 
to-day. But he does not think so himself, and 
so he has done his best to put the old dears into 
modern dress. 

It is impossible without much study to say 
how he has succeeded. He has not succeeded 
entirely, it may be said. " Roderick Hudson " 
and the others are fortunately not quite " brought 
into alignment of style, color, and general liter- 
ary presentment" with "The Golden Bowl." 
Still they are changed. The changes are all (so 
far as my collations extend) in matters of word, 
phrase, and sentence ; chapters and paragraphs 
are as before. Such changes hardly affect 
larger matters : they change the general tone 
and they may change the impression of character. 
Thus Christopher Newman seems an American 
gentleman who in the 70's had had the advan- 
tage of reading Mr. James's later writings. 
Asked if this is the first time he has been 
abroad, he used to say, " Very much so "; now 
he says " Quite immensely the first." Asked 
if he will not learn to talk French, he used to say 
only, " Hang me if I should ever have thought 
of it "; now he adds, " I seemed to feel it too far 
off." When Mile. Nioche tells him that her 
copy is bad he used to say, " I like it all the 
same "; now he says, " I never outgrew a mis- 
take but in my own time and in my own way." 
He once said " I 'm not intellectual "; now he 
says " I don't come up to my own standard of 
culture." 

But I must leave this subject, fascinating 
though it is, because of its immensity. To tell 
what changes Mr. James has made, even what 
sort of changes, if one teU at all accurately (and 
why at all otherwise?) would be a great task. 
And to tell why he made them would be, if not 
a task at least or at most an achievement for a 
far finer divination than is here at the reader's 
service. One must be satisfied with recom- 



mending it to the imiversity students of litera- 
ture as material for doctors' dissertations. 

Let us leave such things, and turn to what 
is for the moment (if not for posterity) of more 
importance. The prefaces will be a delight to 
all Jamesians, even to many who modestly dis- 
claim such a title. To such a one these prefaces 
may be interesting chiefly as helping on toward 
one's conception of the novel as a literary form, 
— to put it in very academic language. Not 
quite so interesting, I should say, as " a unique 
body of criticism of the art of the novelist " (to 
quote the prospectus), but rather a collection of 
facts which will help the student as a foundation 
for a science of fiction. Or to be more practical, 
they will serve the reader of James — the new, 
fresh, unsophisticated reader of James, if there 
are any such, there surely will be, — to see what 
the author is driving at, to see what in the novels 
was the author's conception of the fine thing. 
Not that the author always knows, — we are 
inclined to say, perhaps not, but then we may 
imagine that he has a keener, intenser feeling 
about it than we shall be likely to have. The 
author may be often wrong — Dickens, we may 
remember, fancied himself so much on his plots 
and his pathos ; but then, so are we sometimes 
wrong. And often it is a good tonic to get an 
idea of something that we had not particularly 
noticed. 

So, then, these prefaces are interesting as 
showing us the novelist as he conceives his work. 
In " Roderick Hudson " he speaks of the neces- 
sity of a full living development of his subject ; 
in "The American "of the conception first of the 
situation, and the subsequent entrance therein 
of the hero. In " The Portrait of a Lady " it 
was the figure of Isabel Archer who appeared 
first and gathered around her those who should 
enable her to do what she had to do. In " The 
Princess Casamassima," the first impression 
was the life of a great city calling for apprecia- 
tion and the creation of an intelligence that 
should, after its fashion, appreciate it. Those 
are very interesting things, — not unknown to 
students before, but still rather astonishing to the 
cut-and-dried student (if anything can astonish 
him), the appearance of these three recognized 
modes of conception, if not of construction, in 
the work of the same artist in three consecutive 
works. Other things, too, — the definition (if 
we may use so definite a word about anything 
that Mr. James has written) of romanticism 
by this accomplished realist, the necessity of a 
chorus by this hardly classical modernist, these 
things will be noted and filed away by the

student, read and rolled under the tongue as a 
precious morsel by the Jamesian, grasped (we 
may at least hope) and put to the due use of 
cultivating the taste by the conscientious among 
general readers. 

Yet in addition to all these details there is 
one thing striking in these prefaces : namely, 
Mr. James's sense of life. That certainly Mr. 
James has, — of his own kind, a skeptic may 
say. Mr. James's world may seem to many a 
sequestered, perverted, exasperating world, and 
yet to him it evidently lives. He is not filling 
a regular literary form when he writes, or merely 
doing what the public will like. He has a sense 
of life, and he renders it. There is nothing 
mechanical in his composition, construction, 
architecture. The heroine of " The Portrait of 
a Lady " must have a world to live in, and 
somehow the people that are to make up that 
world gather about her, in a single night, so that 
the novelist wakes one morning and finds them 
all there. The hero of " The Princess Casa- 
massima " must contrast socialism with society, 
and there is Christina Light, not settled and laid 
on the shelf, but living and insistent. There the 
creative imagination gets away from us. There 
in the feeling for vitality we have a man of 
genius, as well as an accomplished artist. 

Well, one cannot say everything. Certainly 
one really ought to take this chance to say 
something ultimate about one of the preeminent 
figures of English literature ; but there has been 
so much else, that that slight matter must fall 
aside. Let us be content for the time with the 
information of the prospectus, that " In the works 
of no other writer have American types of 
character and ideas appeared in such high relief 
and been characterized with such definite refer- 
ence to nationality." It Siu'ely is not worth 
saying anything after that. 

One thing may be remarked in closing. It 
was a very happy idea to illustrate each volume 
with " portraits of some scene, situation, etc., 
representative of the locality of the text," and the 
execution has admirably carried out the plan : 
the pictures are an immense addition to the 
novels. Such as are accustomed to impressions 
of the spirit of place will look long and with 
intense pleasure at the picture of the Faubourg 
Saint Germains in " The American," — it almost 
takes the place of the novel. People who feel 
that they have lost something in the modernistic 
text may feel that they have gained something 
here, and so almost with some of the others. 
The spirit of place, — how much it may be in a 
novel ! People skip long descriptions of scenery, 



doubtless, but there is a sense of place that is 
surely as fine, as satisfying, in a novel as a good 
situation or a good character. One had not, 
perhaps, thought of it before in Mr. James's 
work, nor is it always there. But in some cases 
it is surely felt, as surely he felt it strongly 
himself. Not in Northampton, Mass., or other 
such crudities ; Mr. James, as he explains him- 
seK, has little sense of that sort of thing, — but 
of great centres, of Rome, of London, of Paris, 
" the splendid, the glorious," the sophisticated, 
the decadent, as they used to say themselves.

Stjkveys of American Philosopht.* 



The publication of two histories of American 
Philosophy, one in French and one in English, 
is not merely interesting in itself but also as 
indicating an advancement in our intellectual 
life. We have reached a point in which our 
speculations on the obscure questions of being 
take hold on each other, and take hold on the 
kindred speculations of other nations and other 
times, in a fashion that makes them matters of 
general import. It comes to be understood that, 
no matter how much contempt may be expressed 
for metaphysics as contrasted with inquiries 
which relate more directly to our immediate 
welfare, any people whose thoughts are at all 
active will always be interested v^ this form of 
speculation. A nation is very restricted in its 
mental effort that does not occasionally push its 
conjectures into th* unseen world. Once com- 
ing under this fascination of mind, it will never 
rest in contentment till it has built up about 
known facts a system of coherent assumptions 
which serve to expound and support them. If 
we deal diligently with the visible, it is sure to 
lead us to the invisible as in some way coherent 
with it. 

The first mentioned of these two histories, 
M. Beclaere's " La Philosophic en Amerique," 
is a clear, succinct, timely treatment of the 
growth in American thought of philosophy as 
a solvent of the riddle of being, and helps us to 
understand how certainly these speculations have 
arisen, covered the ground, and are guiding us 
to a more harmonious sense of the nature of the 
life we are leading. Coming from a wi'iter tw 
another nationality, this history is grateful

our American pride. It gives attention to the 
educational and social influence of the various 
authors, as well as to the philosophical notions 
they have advocated. 

The other history referred to, that prepared 
by Dr. I. Woodbridge Riley, is a much fuUer 
presentation, the result of extended inquiry, and 
seems to give us at once footing among the 
thoughtful nations of the world. As a history, 
it opens the way to much further labor, and 
leaves.ia this opening volume the impression of 
a large and not unfruitful field. A history of 
philosophy may lay stress on either part of its 
title ; it may be primarily historical or primarily 
philosophical, itself entering the field of inquiry 
and bringing criticism to its several products. 
Dr. Riley's work imites the two tendencies, keep- 
ing neither exclusively in the foreground. What 
a history of philosophy in America chiefly calls 
for is a tracing of the steps by which this form 
of thought has progressed, and so preparing us 
to take a more intelligent and interested part in 
questions still arising. 

A criticism we are inclined to make on Dr. 
Riley's first volume is its partial lack of a clear 
and succinct statement of the stages of discus- 
sion and of the persons taking part in them. It 
is not easy to give a brief effective presentation 
of any system of philosophy or of its advocates ; 
especially as the belief is often inadequate, and 
its disciples are confused and inconsistent in 
their allegiance. Something must be sacrificed 
to prominent features ; leading considerations 
must be strongly emphasized and qualifications 
passed more rapidly. The writer must photo- 
graph strongly ruling features, even if he fails 
to define perfectly intervening surfaces. Dr. 
Riley seems to us to wander a little loo much 
at random through an author's works, and, by 
mingling his own criticism, to help us still 
further to lose our way and to be left with a 
colorless impression of the force and order of 
events. Strong strokes should be given, even 
if the details of the picture seem somewhat 
neglected. 

So many mistakes are possible in philosophy, 
the darkness shuts in so quickly at so many 
points, we institute so many inquiries to which 
no answer can be given, our explanations are 
so often transient and insufficient, we so readily 
exaggerat(» the fragment of truth we have secured, 
that it behooves us always to have a temper very 
tolerant of error, and to allow the little gold 
gained to be quietly added to our treasure. The 
faults of reason, finding its obscure way in a 
world whose clouds roll back upon us almost as 



soon as they are lifted, should be corrected with 
that patience which grows out of long continued 
and only partially successful effort. This pre- 
cept of quiet consideration, Mr. Riley usually 
observes ; but his words occasionally show aver- 
sion or contempt. When Clark, a small farmer, 
following in the steps of Edwards, ventures the 
conclusion, " The question of foreordination to 
salvation or damnation, like raising a crop of 
wheat, is a question of using ordinary means," 
he is squelched by the remark, " Here is Puritan- 
ism in bucolic trimmings ; Edwards, bound 
in half-calf." It may be doubted whether 
Clark, short-sighted as he was, groped more 
painfully amid the facts of the world than did 
Edwards. 

Dr. Riley seems to us too anxious to trace 
historical connections, as those of Edwards with 
some previous author. Forms of thought are 
not as strictly genetic as forms of life. Given 
general circumstances and current speculations, 
and any one person drops into them or opposes 
them under his own predilections. Personal 
tendencies are potent in the realm of mind. It 
is a waste of ingenuity to strive to trace them 
closely from person to person. Edwards's dis- 
cussions grew out of his religious beliefs. 
Granted his sense of a mystical union with 
God, granted the omnipotence of God, and 
Edwards's view of liberty follows naturally 
from his ruling convictions. What was peculiar 
to Edwards was his unusual analytic power. By 
means of this, he heaped up about any topic a 
formidable argument. Assume the universal 
presence of causation, and nothing but logical 
coherence is called for to disprove the freedom 
of the human mind. 

Dr. Riley's history is the more welcome 
because it comes to us with a far wider survey 
of the field than any which has gone before. 
We are no longer choked up by philosophy which 
has come to us as a by-product of science ; 
we cease to look upon philosophy as at best but 
the aftermath of a field whose chief harvest has 
been gathered in, and we are allowed once more 
to indulge ourselves in a wide survey of physical 
and spiritual facts and the one universe they 
together make up. We cannot readily attach 
too much value to science, but we can easily, 
and often do, under-estimate the considerations 
which give chief interest to life, freighted as it 
is with the wealth of physical knowledge. No 
matter how skiKuUy we may fathom the sea, we 
must still draw our own breath from the heavens 
above us.

The Ancient Apparition op 
THE Mongols.* 



A study of the Mongol race is of immense 
importance, not only for a proper understanding 
of European history and for the destruction of 
much worthless tradition and mythology based 
on our ethnic conceits, but also for right ideas 
in this twentieth century when the ends of the 
earth have met. Not only are the Mongols " at 
our doors," but pretty nearly everybody is called 
a Mongol, or Mongolian, whose eye or whose 
tint of skin, as seen through the haze of our 
ignorance, is supposed to be of the race of 
Genghis Khan. 

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin's history of the Mongols 
is therefore valuable to the ordinary reader, and 
with its index and map will be a useful addition 
to the library. We may even hope that among 
the eighty or ninety millions of a people which 
has treaties with both China and Japan, but 
hardly a Japanese or Korean professorship in 
the whole nation, there will be many readers. 
Having read it, we can admire the patience and 
learning and the literary skill of the author ; for 
he has covered a vast deal of territory, and many 
of his passages are brilliant and show us the 
chief men of the great migrations and temporary 
kingdoms in such a way as to make them seem 
real personalities. Yet it must be said that the 
book is not so much a history as it is an unsifted 
collection of traditions and folk-lore. Mr. 
Curtin may have possessed all the scholarship 
ascribed to him in such generous measure by 
President Roosevelt, in the preface to the 
volume ; but we wish he had given his authori- 
ties, original and secondary, — or, if not these, 
at least a chapter on the sources of his history. 
He might have revealed to us the labors of the 
mighty men of research who had gone before 
him over the ground both of the literature and 
the topography of the subject. Of Howorth the 
compiler, or of Von Hammer the investigator, 
we hear nothing ; nor are there any notes or 
references to either chroniclers, ciitics, scholars, 
or narrators, Asiatic or European, who have told 
the Mongol story. 

It is an awful picture of murder and devas- 
tation which Mr. Curtin has given us. No 
doubt the Mongols were vile and filthy, even 
butchers and devils of a certain sort. Yet when 
it comes to believing in the Mongol as a sort of 
diabolical superman, as the ugliest human being

on earth, and murderous beyond all comparison, 
we must decline to take our opinions from the 
mediaeval chroniclers or the tellers of folk-tales 
whom Mr. Curtin seems to have so fully trusted. 
Such things cannot take the place of the fruits 
of critical scholarship. Of course the popular 
fancy may be hit by descriptions of these 
" squat, slit-eyed, brawny horsemen, with faces 
like the snouts of dogs," and the popular 
Oriental idea of the Mongol will continue to be 
that he emerged from Tartarus, and that we 
white men and " heirs of all the ages " have 
nothing to learn from the descendants of these 
men who are supposed to live in China and Japan, 
and still have an ambition to cover the whole 
earth. Nevertheless, we cannot see how the 
Mongols differed very much from the Assyrians 
or the Romans, who destroyed nations, ploughed 
over sites of cities, and in other ways helped to 
give humanity its blood-baths. 

It is high time for some scholar to sift the 
records and evidence and give the sane and 
critical story of the Mongol invasion, treating 
of the Mongol origin, and settling once for all 
the dispute whether Genghis Khan was or was 
not Yoshitsune the Japanese. Did the Mongols 
bring, from China into Europe, printing by 
means of movable types, and other things that 
were worth having? To a large extent, the 
Mongols constituted the influences that, by 
resistance and absorption, became the making 
of Russia, even as in modem days the menace 
of Russia became so largely the incentive for 
the making of the new Japan. Furthermore, 
while the mediaevalists had the impression of 
snout-faced and squatty enemies, whom they in 
their superstitious fears correlated with the 
devil himself and with the fiends of hell, we 
must not forget that the Mongols may have had 
a no less favorable opinion of the Europeans. 
If some of us could, or would, read in Chinese 
books, and other " Mongolian " literary produc- 
tions, what the Asiatics think of us, our personal 
odor, the set of our eyes, the protrusion of our 
noses, the general offensiveness of our ways, and 
the manner in which reputed Christian soldiers 
and sailors have bombarded and massacred their 
people, we might attain a different view-point 
both of ourselves and of our enemies. By all 
means, let Mr. Curtin's book be read ; it is 
interesting and fairly attractive in form. In 
its composition, Mr. Curtin has followed the 
bent of his genius ; but it cannot accurately be 

called a history. ,^ „ ^

Briefs on New Books. 

_- * * It was inevitable that sooner or later 

J. lie civt of 

landscape such Standard works on landscape 

gardening. gardening as those of Humphry 

Repton (1752-1818) should be given in modern 
form to a public that comprises laymen as well as 
professionals. Under the auspices of the American 
Society of Landscape Architects, and edited by one 
of its members, Mr. John Nolen, the Riverside 
Press has now put forth a volume containing the 
two most important works of this notable pioneer 
in his field, under the title " The Art of Landscape 
Gardening " (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). These two 
works, " Sketches and Hints on Landscape Garden- 
ing" and "Theory and Practice of Landscape 
Gardening," have been so edited as to make them 
of practical usefulness to modern readers and stu- 
dents of the subject, without obliterating Repton's 
frequent quaintness of expression, of which the 
following sentence, opening Chapter II. of the first- 
named work, may be given as an example: "The 
perfection of landscape gardening depends on a 
concealment of those operations of art by which 
nature is embellished; but where buildings are 
introduced, art declares herself openly, and should, 
therefore, be very careful, lest she have cause to 
blush at her interference." Repton's high rank in 
his art is undeniable ; that he was appreciated in 
his own time is shown by the fact that over two 
hundred places, large and small, in various parts of 
England, remain as examples of his "good taste," 
the quality that he exalts most highly. It is doubt- 
less true, as Mr. Nolen points out, that a part of 
this contemj)orary appreciation arose from the for- 
tunate fact that Repton " came at a time of signifi- 
cant development in his profession," which in turn 
was a part of the " romantic " movement. Yet a 
man of such native genius, with a real love of nature, 
the eye of an artist, a deep respect for utility, and a 
realization that a knowledge of many related arts 
and sciences was necessary for a true practice of his 
own profession, must have impressed himself on his 
times sooner or later. Mr. Nolen conceives that, 
significant as was Repton's professional work, his 
writings are "his most permanent contribution to 
his art." They are founded upon his own observa- 
tions and practice, as recorded first in the " Red 
Books " devoted to each place that he laid out or 
improved. In his more formal writings he gave 
numerous extracts from these note-books, and alto- 
gether put in permanent form the principles of his 
art, which he derived by taking the best, as he says, 
from his predecessors, Le Notre and Brown, and 
infusing these with his own genius. The scope of 
the two works under consideration is wide : " Sketches 
and Hints " ( 1795) treats of situations, buildings, 
water, large private places, formal gardening, 
approaches, the affinity between painting and gar- 
dening, and the sources of pleasure in landscape 
gardening ; " Theory and Practice " ( 1803) includes 
these subjects treated more in detail and more sci- 



entifically, and has chapters also on ancient and 
modern gardening, the relation between architecture 
and gardening, the formation of a new place, and 
considerations on color in landscape. Repton's 
notes, together with some by the editor, are grouped 
at the back of the volume. The illustrations, includ- 
ing twenty-two full- page plates besides a frontispiece 
in color and numerous diagrams in the text, are 
especially worthy of mention, because, with the 
exception of a few modern photographs, they are 
reproductions of Repton's own sketches, most of 
them in two sections, one superimposed on the 
other, — the upper one showing a place in its original 
state, the other with improvements proposed or exe- 
cuted. The appearance of the book is in keeping 
with its character and with the assurance of excellence 
afforded by its imprint. 

A pernicious ^ travesty upon truth is ever more 
instance of dangerous than gross error. The 

' near-science." lattgj. deceives only the culpably 
ignorant ; the former misleads the deserving though 
not discerning layman. In no field is such deviation 
more subtle and more pernicious than in that by right 
pertaining to the psychologist ; and if the distinc- 
tion must be awarded for the most flagrant violation 
of the scientific decalogue, the works of Dr. John 
Duncan Quackenbos should be considered for the 
honor. The latest issue from this source, "Hypnotic 
Therapeutics in Theory and Practice" (Harper), 
is no worse than its predecessors, and brings hardly 
a novel aspect of what was sufficiently exploited in 
a former work. There is the same mingling of 
established doctrine with fancifully supported and 
crudely interpreted personal dogma ; the same exag- 
geration of what in modest proportion would be true 
enough ; the same appeal to the lovers of the occult 
and the intellectually asthenic. Mental therapeutics 
is a topic that looms large in the public interest. 
Residts are obtained by methods crude and drastic, 
" bromidic " or " sulphitic," rational and the re- 
verse, — the success being determined by the low or 
high personal equation of the patient. In the field 
where the wise do not altogether fear to tread, yet 
tread with caution, the bolder unwisdom rushes in 
and reaps (not wholly undeservedly) the reward of 
valor ; whereupon old theories are distorted and new 
ones crudely woven to give to practice the back- 
ground of consistent design. Whether the whole 
shall bear an intelligible and significant pattern, or 
be put together with the coherence of a crazy-quilt, 
depends wholly upon the mental quality of the per- 
former. For the product that takes something of 
the warp and woof of science and imitates accepted 
designs, but makes of the whole a plausible counter- 
feit, the term " near-science " is not wholly mal- 
apropos. Hypnotism is real enough ; so is mental 
therapy ; and so are the types of ailment and of 
relief treated in the several chapters of this book. 
But when accepted relations are stated (though 
these also misleadingly) on one page and wholly 
unwarranted deductions on the next — both with

equal conviction — the reader selects the more sen- 
sational and builds up a system of heaven and earth 
that is truly never dreamt of by a sound philosophy. 
This is reaUy " yellow " psychology, and is none the 
less jaundiced because one may charitably concede 
that the author is sincere. The pity of it is that 
more conservative and rational presentations of the 
psychological domain fall upon unwilling and impa- 
tient listeners, while these extravagant systems meet 
with vociferous applause. It is in no small measure 
because such obstacles beset his path that the psychol- 
ogist cannot as successfully command his audience 
as he should, both for his own encouragement and 
the public good. " Near-science " looks much the 
same as the true article, but it will not stand the 
weather. Yet if appearance and the cut of the 
garment are alone cherished, the product is sure to 
be popular. 

In Mr. Montrose J. Moses's " Chil- 
Abookabont ^ , g j^^ ^^ Reading" (New 
children's books. , „ tt- i ? i 

York : Mitchell Kennerley) we have 

one more addition to the abundant collection of 
books about books for children. While there is 
much in it that is sound, practical, and useful, we 
cannot give it unqualified praise ; it is, as the author 
himself admits, an incomplete and unfinished sketch. 
Unlike the more comprehensive treatises on the 
historical, philosophical, cultural, and ethical aspects 
of children's reading, Mr. Moses gives snatches of 
these things, and of some others, — all very inter- 
esting reading, but in no sense satisfying. One 
always feels that there is so much more that ought 
to have been said. The sketch of the development 
of literature for children from the Horn books to the 
days of John Newbery and Isaiah Thomas is neces- 
sarily sketchy and imperfect, but it is interesting and 
useful mainly on account of the Diagram-Chart 
intended to indicate partially "The Growth of 
Juvenile Literature." In a section called "The 
Old-fashioned Library " the later eighteenth-century 
and early nineteenth-century writers for children are 
dealt with in somewhat fuller detail. But is not 
the attitude of mind which judges children's books 
of the past from the present-day point of view an 
unscientific one ? In order properly to evaluate 
them we should consider them with reference to the 
conditions in which the children then lived, not with 
reference to the suitability of books of past times to 
the needs of the children of to-day. The further 
history of books for children in England and America 
is traced in the section "ConcerningThenandNow," 
which is somewhat poor and thin. For example, 
there is no reference to Reinecke Fuchs ( " Reynard 
the Fox "), so popular in England and all over 
Europe ; and the very beautiful epoch-making series 
of books for children projected and edited by Sir 
Henry Cole, of South Kensington fame, and W. J. 
Thoms the librarian of the House of Lords, and 
published by Joseph Cundall in England a little 
before the middle of the last century, is not honored 
with a line ! From the point of view of selecting, 
editing, illustrating, and the practical details of type 



and printing, as well as the literary qualities which 
should enter into the making of books for children, 
this series has not since been surpassed ; and in no 
survey of the history of books for children should 
it be overlooked. The section devoted to " The 
Library and the Book " and " The School and the 
Home," as well as the book-lists in the appendices, 
have practical value ; these chapters are mainly the 
result of collaboration by experts, whose " wide 
experience, intimate contact with and knowledge of 
the books considered, and desire to show a human 
respect for the tastes of children" entitle them to 
the highest consideration. There are many slips, 
errors, and omissions, sadly needing correction, 
which we have not space to indicate here ; and 
surely Mr. Moses should have known better than to 
send out such a book without an index. 



The Duchesse ^^ would be impossible to find an 
de Lonc/uevilie apter designation for Anne, Duchesse 
and her times. ^g LongueviUe, than the one that Mr. 
H. Noel Williams has chosen as the title of his 
recently published study of the Duchesse and her 
times, — "A Princess of Intrigue " ( Putnam ) . Born 
of a race of royal intriguers, thrust from a convent 
into the artificial atmosphere of the Hotel de 
Rambouillet and the gaiety of a corrupt court, where 
her wit and beauty carried everything before them, 
married to a man twice her age, who cared nothing 
for her but was wax in her hands for any mapcap 
political adventure, she found herself, at twenty-five, 
an object of universal homage and a power to be 
reckoned with in the state of France. Naturally 
her ambition responded to the spur of opportunity. 
As fond of power as other gi-eat Frenchwomen have 
been, she seems to have been much less emotional. 
Lovers, save one, she scorned, valuing personal 
admiration only because it could be converted into 
partisanship. And yet in the ultimate crisis her 
love for La Rochefoucauld (of the " Maximes " and 
the prematurely published " M^moires ") triumphed 
over her loyalty to the house of Cond^ ; she joined 
herself and her following to the opposition party, 
and the wars of the Fronde followed. This is the 
story that Mr. Williams repeats, drawing for his 
details upon all available sources, both contemporary 
and modern. His work is issued in two handsome 
volumes, with many portraits of the Duchesse and 
her friends and enemies by way of illustration. 
Compared with some of his previous studies of great 
Frenchwomen this one lacks vivacity ; the figure of 
Mme. Longueville hardly dominates the complicated 
picture of the events through which she moved. In 
part at least, this is due to the fact that, stripped of 
her beauty and her semi-royal standing, she would 
scarcely have been of commanding calibre.

of him prepared for the " English Men of Letters " 
series (Macmillan) by Mr. G. C. Macaulay. Yet 
some new facts, as announced in his preface, have 
been unearthed, especially concerning the production 
of Thomson's plays, his relations with Lyttelton, and 
the tenure of his successive posts under the govern- 
ment. More important and interesting, however, 
than these small matters of detail in a rather une- 
ventful life are the author's contributions, in the way 
of appreciative comment, toward a better under- 
standing of Thomson as a poet of nature, and a 
more accurate determination of his influence on the 
poetry of his century, not only in England but also 
in France and Germany. " Poetical ' nature-study ' 
in the modern sense of the term," the writer goes 
so far as to maintain, " had its origin, paradoxical 
as the assertion may seem, in the first half of the 
eighteenth century ; for it was then for the first time 
that the phenomena of external nature came to be 
regarded as objects of poetry in and for themselves." 
To say this of any poet or poets born and bred in 
the atmosphere of artificiality and turgid formality 
that to us seem so characteristic of eighteenth- 
century literature, is to say a good deal. To get back 
to nature one would hardly betake himself to the 
England of Thomson's time. But, at any rate, Mr. 
Macaulay's discussion of the matter is interesting ; 
and the book throughout is suggestive and stimu- 
lating. The treatment of " The Castle of Indolence " 
and the minor poems is as scholarly as that of " The 
Seasons." As a careful study of a not superla- 
tively prepossessing theme, the little volume deserves 
nothing but praise. 

The home of A recent volume in the " South Amer-

of the southern ican Series (imported by Charles

Elliot's work on Chili. It is mainly historical, 
though it includes chapters on the industrial and 
social and commercial life of the " England of the 
Pacific," as this British author dubs what we 
Americans are more apt to call the " home of the 
Yankees of the southern continent." To one not 
versed in the intricacies of early and later Spanish 
intrigues, the long story of plot and counter-plot, of 
rebellion and treachery, of massacre and graft, is 
neither pleasing nor interesting reading ; though it 
is conceivable that the Chili of to-day is best inter 
preted in the light — or, rather, the darkness — of 
her past. The author is not in sympathy with 
American pretensions in that quarter, and stoutly 
denies that the United States lent any assistance to 
Chili in its struggles for liberty — Hancock to the 
contrary notwithstanding, — and blithely dismisses 
the Monroe Doctrine as a cause for mirth among 
South American republics. Chili has an aristocracy 
whose Castilian lineage is a ground for hauteur and 
exclusiveness, and for the aristocratical form of 
so-called popular government which prevails. Her 
industry and commerce are in the hands of the 
English and Germans, who quickly become loyal 
ChUeilos. No country of the world has so valuable 



a working class as the Chilian inquilino, disciplined 
by centuries of oppression and toil, but still suffi- 
ciently inspirited to make a splendid soldier. Her 
vast natural resources and magnificent maritime 
opportunities, and the inroads which modern science 
and education have even now made upon the bar- 
barism and superstition which have clouded her 
history, augur well for her future.

Born in Switzerland in 1817, the son of that Her-

fame as the disciple and associate of Pestalozzi, the 
younger Hermann followed naturally and willingly 
in his father's footsteps as a Pestaiozzian teacher 
and educational reformer. Switzerland, England, 
and America were successively the scenes of his 
labors, but the institution with which he was finally 
and permanently identified was the Oswego State 
Normal and Training School, where he taught the 
philosophy of education, and also geometry and 
modern languages, for twenty-five years. He re- 
signed his post in 1887, and died in 1903, leaving 
behind him an autobiography, relating chiefly his 
rich and varied experience as an educator, and also 
a more detailed and personal record in the form of 
a diary. From these abundant sources has been 
compiled a full and readable account of a man of 
pronounced character, high ideals, and remarkable ■ 
energy ; and from his lectures and unpublished 
writings a few characteristic selections have been 
added. He was associated, first and last, with many 
prominent educators — notably Agassiz and Guyot, 
his compatriots, — and his life-story was well worth 
the telling. An error that has rather strangely 
escaped the editor's vigilance is a reference to 
" Williamsburgh " as one of the attractive resorts 
of the Berkshire hUls, where Williamstown, the seat 
of Williams College, must have been meant. Good

lightly dismissed by the reviewer. In " The Letters 
of Robert Schumann" (Dutton), as selected and 
edited by Dr. Karl Storck and translated by Miss 
Hannah Bryant, we have, in reasonably small com- 
pass, a very winning presentation of the composer's 
artistic, sentimental, and romantic ideals and enthu- 
siasms. The earlier letters, from Leipzig and 
Heidelberg, mostly to his mother at home in Zwickau, 
are full of the emotions and aspirations and amiable 
conceits of a gifted and imaginative youth ; the 
letters to his sweetheart and future wife, Clara 
Wieck, are tender and devoted ; and those to his 
musical friends illustrate his progress and his tastes 
in his chosen calling. Schumann matured early, but 
there is an amusing mannishness about some of his 
student letters, as in this extract from a Heidelberg 
• letter to his mother, the writer being but nineteen 
years old : " I think it is a pity for a young man to 
come to a town where the student holds undisputed 
sway. A young man of any grit develops best under 
a system of repression, and this perpetual loimging 
with no one but students limits his mental outlook, 
and injures him incalculably for practical life. . . . 
Fortunately I am sufficiently sobered to value things 
at their proper worth. I should certainly let any 
son of mine study one year at Heidelberg and three 
at Leipzig." A not too pronounced flavor of the 
sinnreich, the gefuhZvoll, the schwarmerisch even, 
pervades the letters, in a pleasant way, and gives 
them an undeniable charm. A portrait of Schumann 
and one of Clara Wieck are provided. 

,^ r ^,..„ Mr. Frederick V. Holman's sketch 

McLoughlin p t-v t i tut r i !• 

and the story of Dr. John McLoughlin is a eu- 
0/ Oregon. logy prepared in celebration of 

" McLoughlin day " at the Lewis and Clark Expo- 
sition in 1905. Proving too lengthy for the occa- 
sion, it was condensed for oral delivery, and has 
since been printed in full by the Arthur H. Clark 
Company of Cleveland. Although "largely re- 
written " according to the introduction, the address 
apparently retains in the main its original form. It 
consists of two parts : an accumlation of testimony 
to the effect that the Americans could not have 
maintained themselves in Oregon without the assist- 
ance of Dr. McLoughlin, and the story of the 



conspiracy that robbed Dr. McLoughlin of his 
land-claim at Oregon City from its inception to the 
return of the claim to Dr. McLoughlin's heirs, by 
the State Legislature, five years after his death. 
The address is written in an entertaining style and 
with a full knowledge of local conditions ; but it is to 
be regretted that Mr. Holman did not put together 
all the obtainable data regarding McLoughlin in a 
more formal biography. About a third of the volume 
consists of illustrative documents, and two interesting 
portraits are given. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" A Collection of Eighteenth Century Verse," edited 
by Miss Margaret Lynn, is published by the Macmillan 
Co. All the leading poets of the century are repre- 
sented, and Dryden is thrown in for good measure. A 
group of Scotch songs and ballads fills a small but 
important niche in this volume. There are about four 
hundred pages of poems, and seventy-five of notes. 

" The Poets: Geoffrey Chaucer to Alfred Tennyson " 
is the title of a work in two volumes published by Mr. 
Henry Frowde The author is Mr. William Stebbins, 
and his task has been to set down his " impressions " of 
about seventy poets (including four Americans), inter- 
spersing the statement of his ideas with copious extracts. 
It makes a pleasant book to read, for it is the work of 
an ardent lover of poetry, but it is too personal an 
expression to have any marked critical value. 

The vein which Longfellow worked so satisfactorily 
in his " Poets and Places " has suffered neglect from 
later editors, but there have been several recent signs 
of a revival of this species of anthology-making. Mr. 
Robert Haven Schauffler, for example, now publishes, 
through Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co., a volume called 
" Through Italy with the Poets," which exhibits good 
judgment in its choice of poems, and makes a collection 
which every lover of Italy (and who is not one?) 
must prize. It will be particularly valued for bringing 
together many beautiful pieces of very recent compo- 
sition, and for the classified arrangement which makes 
it useful for specific reference. 

It is difficult to understand the raison d'etre of the 
book of " English Quotations " prepared by Mr. Robinson 
Smith, and now published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & 
Co. It is described as " a collection of the more memor- 
able passages and poems of English literature, arranged 
accordmg to authors chronologically," and is provided 
with a verbal index. The words " passages and poems " 
in this description indicate the uncertainty of the com- 
piler's aim. Long poems, such as Gray's " Elegy " and 
Wordsworth's " ImmortaUty " are given complete, or 
nearly so, but hundreds of other poems equally important 
are represented by short passages, or ignored altogether. 
On the other hand, the short quotations are taken rather 
at random, and the most familiar lines are likely to be 
looked for in vain. Consequently, we cannot call the 
book either a good anthology or a good reference manual 
of familiar quotations. The editor's sense of proportion 
may be illustrated by saying that he gives us forty pages 
of Wordsworth and fourteen hnes of Byron. The poe- 
try selected is good, as far as it goes, but the selection 
seems to be representative of one man's taste, instead 
of illustrating the consensus of received critical opinion.

in the same field is Dr. Lilburn Merrill's "Winning 
the Boy," which the Fleming H. Revell Co. will issue 
shortly. Dr. Merrill is a physician who has been asso- 
ciated with Judge Lindsey's Juvenile Court work in 
Denver. 

The H. M. Caldwell Co. of Boston and New York 
have been appointed agents in the United States for 
Messrs. Blackie & Son of Glasgow of all books bearing 
their copyright, and will publish all the future works of 
Captain F. S. Brereton, Alexander Macdonald, F.R.G.S., 
and Robert Macdonald, three of the most popular vmters 
of boys' books. They also announce for immediate pub- 
lication the following: "A Pageant of Elizabethan 
Poetry," arranged by Arthur Symons; " La France 
Monarchique," by George A. Powell, B.A., and Oswald 
B. Powell, B.A.; "Benares, the Sacred City," by E. B.

Henry Loomis Nelson, formerly editor of " Harper's 
Weekly," and for the past six years David A. Wells 
professor of political science at Williams College, died 
on February 29 at the home of his daughter in New 
York City. Professor Nelson was born in New York 
City, January 5, 1846, was graduated from Williams 
College, studied law at Columbia, and was admitted to 
the bar in 1869. He practiced law for six years, then 
went to Washington, where he acted as correspondent 
to the Boston « Post " until 1888, and then as private 
secretary for Speaker Carlisle. Later he became prin- 
cipal editorial writer on the Boston " Post," and subse- 
quently he took charge of the New York " Star." In 
1894 he became editor of "Harper's Weekly," a position 
he held four years. His other journalistic work was in 
connection with the New York " World." He was the 
author of several books, chiefly on economic subjects. 



Announcements of Spring Books. 



Our annual list of books announced for Spring publication, 
herewith presented, contains some eight hundred titles — • 
practically the same number as in the corresponding list of 
last year, — and offers convincing evidence that the publishing 
trade has not been seriously affected by the recent business 
depression. All the books here listed are presumably new 
books — new editions not being included unless having new 
form or matter. The omission of any prominent publishers 
from the present list is due solely to the fact that such pub- 
lishers failed to respond to our repeated requests for data 
regarding their Spring books. If they can yet be induced 
to divulge the required information, the announcements of 
these houses will appear in our next issue. .

'' THE RETURN OF THE ESSAY '' 
Miss Zephine Humphrey's OVER AGAINST GREEN PEAK 

The homely experiences of a bright young woman and her wise Aunt Susan, not to mention the " hired girl," in and about a 

white house with green blinds which is the threshold of a charming acquaintance with New England country life. 

Publishers' readers, if good, seldom indulge in prophecies, and are seldom surprised at anything that happens. So it is not 

strange that one of them reports that he ' ' will not be surprised if this book takes a place with those humorous and poetic records of 

country life which have made some authors famous." He further says: " If the last chapter, not to speak of some of the other 

chapters, is not both ' nature study ' and ' literature ' of a high order, I don't know where to look for either." 12mo. 

Ready early in April. 

Spender's COMMENTS OF BAGSHOT 

A remarkable book by the editor of T?ie Westminglei- Oazette which comments delightfully upon such subjects as "Friend- 
ship," "Bores," " The Eleventh Hour Man," "Shyness," "Wealth," "Poverty," "The Needy and the Greedy," "Women's 
Morality," etc. 12mo. Ready early in April. 

The London Spectatot — " While affording the easiest of reading, it touches fine issues finely and deep issues deeply. Makes 
you think . . . wise and witty." 

Sherman's WORDS TO THE WISE— AND OTHERS ^ySre^: 

Boston Transcript — "These essays hold a freshness and piquancy wholly delightful. . . . Whatever she has written upon, 
familiar in title or not, opens fresh doors into delightful thoughts and fancies." 



THREE NOTEWORTHY SPRING NOVELS 



Ellis's ARKINSAW COUSINS 



A STORY OF THE OZARKS. $1.50. 

" A very picturesque story . . . excellent character studies of very unusual types of persons . . . never seen in the pages of 
fiction before, and they are well worth becoming acquainted with . . . vivid and original." — Philadelphia Ledger. 

"Pleasant kindly people whose acquaintance the reader will be glad to make. The sentiment is natural, the humor is not 
strained, and there are many bright remarks that linger in the memory . . . the tragedy of the drunkenness of Peter is genuine, 
original fun, and is true to nature besides. It is a very satisfactory story." — New York Sun . 



Barron's THE LOST GODDESS 



A story of love and adventure concerning some modern New Yorkers and the perils of their search for a beautiful girl at the 

headwaters of the Amazon . $1 .50. 

" A decidedly absorbing tale of adventure. More than readable." — Louisville Courier-Journal. 

De Morgan's SOMEHOW GOOD ^ll-'^^^^^^iy^'^'""'""" """"^ 

" Absolutely masterly." — The Dial. 

" A book as sound, as sweet, as wholesome, as wise, as any in the range of fiction." — The Nation. 

" If you love your Thackeray, you may chance it safely enough — and have your reward. If you know Joseph and Alice, you do 
not need to be told anything more." — New York Times Review. 

" Mr. De Morgan confounded the pedants when he published ' Joseph Vance.' . . . Mr. De Morgan's genius . . . makes them 
live. ... A curious blend of sympathy, humor, worldly wisdom, and, above all, loving kindness. . . . While the spell lasts you can 
grant him anything." — New York Tribune. 

By the author of " The Marathon 
Mystery," etc. $1.50. 

Another story in which Lester, the young lawyer, and Godfrey, the reporter, play the part of detectives in unraveling a modem 
mystery. 

" A well-written romance. . . . Lester's methods are not those of the accepted type of story-book detective. . . . He is, in short, 
an everyday kind of man, not too good to be true. The story is well conceived and originally worked out, and should be one of the 
most popular of the day." — New York Times Review. 

" We can say in all truth that neither characters nor pages are soiled by sordid motives or deeds. ... A good story, deserving 
to be read, deserving of praise." — Chicago Tribune. 

" A well-constructed detective story . . . worked out to a surprising conclusion." — C7«cafiro Post. 

" Starts with a capital situation . . . the reader is utterly unable to guess at the secret." — New York Tribune. •

GENERAL SCOPE OF THE SERIES 



In preparation 



THE 

POPULAR BALLAD 

By Prof. FRANCIS B. GUM- 
MERE of Haverford College. 
The book contains citations from 
nearly three hundred ballads, and is 
furnished with biographical notes, 
index, and a prefatory note. 

" A particular merit of the volume, 
which distinguishes it from any pre- 
vious treatment of the subject, is the 
clearness with which the difference 
is brought out between choral and 
epic elements. Never before have 
the workings of tradition been set 
forth so well. The point is vital, and 
to have it settled once for all, is 
comfort and enlightenment unspeak- 
able. . . . For my own part, and I 
say it very deliberately, I never 
expected to see so good a book in 
its kind, and I am confident that the 
subject will never be treated so well 
again in my lifetime." — Professor 
Gbohob Lyman Kittredoe, in the 
Atlantic Monthly.

THE LITERATURE 
OF ROGUERY 

By Prof. F. W. CHANDLER, 
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. 

" Professor Chandler's work la so 
filled with important material that it 
may be profitably returned to again 
and again." — Boston Transcript, 

" A world of information is fur- 
nished by this almost encyclopedic 
work of Professor Chandler, which is 
really a signal contribution to research 
literature." — Chicago Tribune.

TRAGEDY 

By Prof. A. H. THORNDIKE, 
of Columbia University. 

A fresh, authoritative, and elo- 
quently written account of tragedy 
during the Shakespearean period, and 
the first coherent narrative of the for- 
tunes of tragedy in the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries. 

$1.50 net. Postage 12 cents. 



THIS series of volumes aims to present a 
comprehensive account of English liter- 
ature according to a new plan. Instead of the 
usual division of the field into chronological 
periods, a division according to types has been 
adopted, thus securing for the first time a unity 
in the treatment of the rise and development 
of all the important literary forms in English. 
Many neglected aspects of literary history will 
receive attention, and many new starting points 
for criticism and research will be suggested. 
Each volume has been intrusted to an acknow- 
ledged specialist in the particular field. 

" Its judicious plan is to g^ve a volume or 
more to each clearly defined literary genre, 
instead of assigning, as has been the practice 
in many large works of the kind, a ' period ' 
to each writer. Both methods have their ad- 
vantages and their disadvantages ; almost any 
great collection of facts can be classified in 
various ways for different purposes. Certainly 
the development of a particular literary type 
can be studied more satisfactorily by isolating 
it from irrelevant facts , and the full story of 
the literary activity of a century is confusing, 
no matter how clearly it is presented." 

— Springfield Republican. 

" The series is sure to be a useful one." . . . 
— Brooklyn Eagle. 

" An important series of books, which, when 
completed, will give a comprehensive history 
of English Literature from a new point of 
view." — Hartford Courant. 

" The series classifies literary products along 
vertical instead of horizontal lines. Type and 
not chronology is made the basis of classifica- 
tion. Periods are subordinated to structural 
form, each monograph by an authority on his 
assigned subject being limited to the character- 
istics, tendencies, and influence of a single 
formal type, and in gathering within the com- 
pass of a single well-digested and carefully 
developed volume of all the details, biograph- 
ical, bibliographical, historical, and critical, of 
the literary form under consideration."

FICTION 

The Husbands of Edith. ByGEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON, author of "Graustark," 
" The Day of the Dog," etc. Illustrations in color by Harrison Fisher. lamo, cloth . . . $1.25 
This is in Mr. McCutcheon's best style, which is to say that it is inimitably clever and entertaining. 
The story opens in Paris, where the hero is ingeniously induced by a friend, a young Englishman, to assume 
his identity for a few weeks and make a trip to Vienna. The Englishman disappears upon a mission of his 
own and the hero prepares for his trip. What is his horror when he learns that not only must he assume his 
friend's name, clothes, monocle and speech, but his wife and baby! To complicate matters, his supposed 
wife's sister, a charming girl, joins the party. The hero falls desperately in love with her, and is unable to 
conceal his feelings, not only from the young lady, but from anyone else. In this situation, the hero, with his 
supposed wife, baby and sister-in-law, sets out with a party of English tourists for a trip through the Tyrol. 
For the story of what happens there, told as Mr. McCutcheon can tell it, the reader is referred to the book itself. 

My Lady of Cleeve. By PERCY J, hartley, illustrated in colors. Cover in color by 

Harrison Fisher. lamo, cloth I1.50 

It would be difficult to find a more fascinating story for those who enjoy a tale of the course of true love — 

which never does run smooth. 

The Fair Moon of Bath. By Elizabeth ELLIS, author of "Barbara Wlnslow." illus- 
trated in colors by John Rae. izmo, cloth . * fi-So 

Candidly, " The Fair Moon of Bath " is not just as good as " Barbara Winslow," // is better. 

Meryl. By WILLIAM TILLINGHAST ELDRIDGE, author of " Hilma." Full-page illustrations 

in color by John Rae. izmo, cloth $1.50 

There is always room for a story in which there is " something doing." " Meryl " moves with a whirl; 

it is modern, absorbing, exciting. It should be^edicated to tiresome journeys, sleepy evenings and dull days, 

for while one reads it, time will be neither dull nor slow. 

The Mother of the Man. By EDEN PHILLPOTTS, author of " children of the Mist, •' The 

Farm of the Dagger, etc. izmo, cloth $1.50 

"The sincerity and humanity of Mr. Phillpotts' method at its best are found in his new Dartmoor 
Romance." — The Evening Star (Washington, D. C.) . 

The Dissolving Circle. By will LILLIBRIDGE, author of "Ben Blair," "Where the Trail 

Divides," etc. Illustrated in color by The Kinneys. lamo, cloth $1.50 

Mr. Lillibridge writes about men of the Far West — big, primitive men with headstrong passions and 

iron wills. The hero of " The Dissolving Circle " is such a man. 

Lord of the World. By Robert HUGH BENSON, author of " The Light invisible," " A 

Mirror of Shalott," etc. izmo, cloth $i-So 

This story is, in every sense of the word, remarkable. The author's brilliant imagination is guided by 

logic and restrained by common sense, and the whole book is animated with a big purpose. 

The Man Who Was Thursday. By gilbert k. chesterton, author of " Varied 

Types," "Heretics," etc. izmo, cloth $i.So 

Mr. Chesterton is such a past-master in sophistries and casuistry, such a juggler of paradoxes, such an 
adept in the arts whereby the brilliant and quick-witted pull the wool over the eyes of their less gifted brethren, 
that he can give full and serious credibility to his tale of the astounding adventures of the detective who was 
admitted into the innermost circle of anarchists. 

The Vigil. By HAROLD BEGBIE, author of "The Penalty," etc. izmo, cloth .... $1.50 
This is a theological novel, and such a good one that a distinguished critic who read the story before 
publication says : " I am inclined to call it the 'very best of its kind in the language. It shows a far deeper 
and truer insight into the theological controversy of the time than, for example, ' Robert Elsmere.' " 

Exton Manor. By Archibald Marshall, author of " Richard Baldock," " The House of 

Merrilees," " Peter Binney, Undergraduate," etc. izmo, cloth |i-SO 

" Such a piece of quiet, good workmanship is a pleasure in the days of up-to-date bad writing." — The

On the Knees of the Gods. By anna bowman DODD, author of "Cathedral Days,"

The author has here succeeded in revivifying the Golden Age of Athens, as Bulwer did that of Pompeii.

MISCELLANEOUS BOOKS 
A Guide to the West Indies. By Frederick a. ober, author of " Our West Indian 

Neighbors," etc. Protusely illustrated, and with many colored maps. 

8vo, flexible, cloth net, I2.25 

8vo, flexible leather Special net, $2.7$ 

In view of the number of tourists who yearly visit these islands, there is great need of an accurate and 
comprehensive guide-book. Such a book has been prepared by Mr. Frederick A. Ober, who, having been 
intimately acquainted with the West Indies for thirty years, is well qualified for his task. It is a guide-book 
to the Bermudas, Bahamas, Cuba, Porto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti and Santo Domingo, the Danish, Virgin, 
Dutch, French, Leeward and Windward Islands, Barbados and Trinidad. It is comprehensive, accurate and 
convenient, giving all the information which a tourist desires as to routes, hotels, rates, places of interest, the 
history and present condition of the islands, their flora and fauna, commerce, natural resources, etc. This 
book should be the Standard Guide to the West Indies. 

Tuscan Feasts and Tuscan Friends. By dorothy nevile lees, illustrated, 

i2mo, cloth net, $1.60 

A charming book on a charming subject, will be the reader's verdict. From her home in a Tuscan villa 
near Florence the author sallies out into the country roundabout and returns with delightful sketches of the 
hills and woods, and the country people big and little. The author knows her Tuscan peasantry, from 
wrinkled grandfathers to tiny bambinos, and she writes of their work, their homes, their customs and their 
feasts with a sympathetic and sure touch. Individual characters are so deftly and feelingly portrayed that one 
might characterize the book as a kind of " Cranford " or "Our Village." 

Letters from Percy Bysshe Shelley to Elizabeth Hitchener. Noiv first 

published. With introduction and notes by Bertram Dobell. i2mo, cloth net,$i.$o 

The forty-seven letters here printed were written between June, 1811, and June, 1812. At that time 
Shelley was only about nineteen years of age, but during the period covered by the letters many of the most 
important events of his life took place. In fact, his life during these months was full of romantic incidents 
which were to leave their mark for good or evil on the whole of his future career. The letters are written in 
a strain of the most candid and unreserved self-revelation. They exhibit in the liveliest colors the character of 
this rash, chivalrous, frank, and generous youthful poet. Without them we should want by far the most 
important documents for the history of his life at this time ; with them we could dispense with all the other 
records of this period. 

Passages from the Past By his grace, the duke of Argyll, author of "Life of 

Queen Victoria," etc. Copiously illustrated, large 8vo, cloth. Two volumes net, $6.^0 

The one important question in considering a volume of reminiscences is — has the author any recollections 
which interest other people? Certainly the Duke of Argyll, who is better known to Americans as the Marquis 
of Lome, one of the best and most popular of Canadian viceroys, has had better opportunities than fall to the 
lot of most men to store up interesting recollections. One of the leading peers of England, whose titles alone 
occupy twenty-four lines in "Who's Who," a son-in-law of Queen Victoria and a man prominently con- 
nected with the English Government at home and abroad for a lifetime, there have been few prominent men 
and women in Europe and America in the last half century whom he has not known. Some of the famous 
persons whom he recalls in this volume of reminiscences, to mention them at haphazard, are: Wordsworth, 
Tennyson, Browning, Lord Brougham, Lord Dufferin, Cavour, Garibaldi, General Lee, General Grant, 
Seward, Longfellow, Bismarck, Emperor William I., Victor Emmanuel, Emperor Francis Joseph, Mr. 
Gladstone, Louis Napoleon and Eugenie, Disraeli, Queen Victoria and the royal family, of course, and 
others too numerous to mention. 

Myths about Monarchs. By HANSARD watt, author of " Home-made History." i2mo, 

cloth net, |r.oo 

A book of clever nonsense verses, some of which have already been published in "The Westminster 
Gazette," "The London Magazine," " Cassell's Magazine" and others. The author draws amusing 
sketches of such musty old monarchs as Pharaoh, Cyrus, Busiris, Croesus, and Darius. 

Brain and Personality. Revised Edition. By dr. w. hanna Thomson, m.d., lld. 

i2mo, cloth net, $1.20 

The object of this book is to acquaint the general reader with the remarkable discoveries of modern 
physiological science of the specific relations of the certain areas on the surface of the brain to special mental 
functions. It has been the aim of the author to steer clear of technical terms as far as possible.

/^OLONEL CARR has shown in his 
^^ new book, as few living men could, 
just how vitally interesting that period 
was, between the days of the anti-slavery 
agitation and the time just gone. The 
distinguished author of " The Illini " and 
" Lincoln at Gettysburg" has known per- 
sonally and intimately probably as many 
of the great men and women of this 
country as any other man now living, 
and thus he is in a position to give his 
reminiscences the intimate personal note 
which lifts them above the mere historical 
narrative. " My Day and Generation " is 
fraught with meaning for all who would 
know how this country came to be what it is, and is written with all the facility 
and power of philosophical analysis that distinguished Colonel Carr's other books.

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF MODERN HISTORIES IS UNQUESTIONABLY 

LORD CROMER'S great worh on MODERN EGYPT 



The difficulties of admin- 
istering an Eastern de- 
pendency by a Western 
nation are causing the 
most vital political prob- 
lems of this century, in 
the opinion of many. 



Lord Cromer aims to do two things : 

First, he wishes to place on record an accurate narrative of the progress of affairs and 
the principal events which have occurred in Egypt and the Soudan since 1876 ; his work 
has been done with extreme thoroughness and with constant access to the documents 
of the Foreign Offices in Cairo and London. During the whole period of which he 
writes he was in close communication with every one who played any prominent part in 
Egyptian affairs. 

Second, he wishes to explain the results which have accrued to Egypt from the British 
occupation of the country in 1882 — results which are creating the liveliest interest 
among those who, facing problems not wholly dissimilar, have watched keenly the 
development of Egypt under Lord Cromer from a state of anarchy to its present pros- 
perous condition. In two octavo volumes, with two portraits, $6.00 net. 



OF INTEREST CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ABOVE ARE THESE 



Mr. B. L. Putnam Weale's forecast of 
The Coming Struggle in Eastern Asia 

contains a critical account of the Japanese plan and 

policy since the great war, and a clear outline of the 

attitude forced upon the United States in the East.

England In two volumes 
By A. Lawrence Lowell 

A comprehensive survey of the English political 
system, comparable in value only to the Hon. James 
Bryce's The American Commonwealth, and likely 
to become equally indispensable in the study of pop- 
ular government. Probably ready in April.

A PRAGM ATIC SANCTION. 

The first attempt to produce a newspaper in 
America was made in Boston, on the twenty-fifth 
of September, 1690. The sheet was entitled 
" Publick Occurrences," and was suppressed by 
the authorities after the appearance of the first 
issue. Only one copy of that single issue is 
now known to be in existence, and is preserved 
in the Public Record Office in London. The 
aims of the venture were succinctly set forth, 
and among them we find the following : " That 
something may be done towards the Curing, or 
at least the Charming of that Spirit of Lying, 
which prevails among us, wherefore nothing 
shall be entered, but what we have reason to 
believe is true repairing to the best fountains for 
our Information. And when there appears any 
material mistake in anything that is collected, 
it shall be corrected in the next." These words 
show with what good intentions the incipiency 
of American journalism was marked ; that it was 
also deliberate in another sense appears from 
the fact that the paper was to be published only 
once a month, unless some " Glut of Occur- 
rences " should necessitate a more frequent 
appearance. It is not probable that the pro- 
jectors of this sheet were familiar with Shake- 
speare, but if they had been, they might have 
supported their accusation of mendacity by a 
text from Falstaff — " Lord, how this world is 
given to lying ! " But they could hardly have 
anticipated the extent to which lying as a fine 
art was destined to be encouraged by the very 
agency which they were engaged in bringing 
into activity (as they fondly supposed) for its 
suppression. 

We have gone far since the days when the 
guileless fisherman of Massachusetts Bay freed 
the genie of journalism from its leaden casket. 
The newspaper is no longer a furtive experi- 
ment, but an established institution, provided 
with traditions, with set rules, and with fimda- 
mental dogmas. These attributes are the out- 
come of its long and active existence, and have 
slowly taken shape under the pressure of cir- 
cumstances. The policy of journalism is as 
definite a thing as the policy of diplomacy, or 
of monarchy, or of ecclesiasticism. It is bound 
at aU costs to maintain the efficiency of the 



200

institution, and holds itself exempt from con- 
siderations that would be binding upon the 
individual conscience. Just as a king, or an 
ambassador, or a bishop will commit himself in 
his institutional or representative character to a 
course of action which would be impossible to a 
morally-minded individual, so an editor will do 
many things which would be abhorrent to him 
as a man conscious only of his personal relation 
to his fellows. In his private intercourse, he 
may be the soul of truthfulness, but when he 
dons his robes the truth is no longer in him ; he 
becomes the partisan of a policy, and is prepared 
in its interests to resort to the suppressio veri 
and the suggestio falsi ^ and to aid his cause by 
downright falsehood as far as the employment 
of falsehood seems reasonably safe. 

The sacred word of the editorial calling, as 
of the other callings we have grouped in the 
same category, is " prestige," and nothing short 
of the danger of an impaired prestige will keep 
the representative of either of these callings near 
the line of scrupulous conduct. The prestige 
of the State must be preserved, even at the cost 
of immoral treaties and unrighteous wars ; the 
prestige of the Church must be maintained, 
even at the cost of suppressing free inquiry 
and condoning obvious guQt ; the prestige of 
the newspaper must be guarded, even at the 
cost of betraying the public and defeating the 
ends of justice. Professor Munroe Smith, in 
a recent issue of the "North American Re- 
view," has developed this thesis as regards 
journalism in a highly interesting manner, 
and has ingeniously shown that "the doctrine 
of journalistic inerrancy " is fundamentally 
necessary for the support of newspaper pres- 
tige, just as the doctrine of predestination is the 
necessary foundation for the logical structure 
of Calvinism, and just as the doctrine of divine 
right is the necessary bulwark of monarchical 
absolutism. 

The word "prestige," as our writer points 
out, has a dubious history, admirably fitting it 
for its modem use as the shibboleth of news- 
paperdom. In the eighteenth century, "pres- 
tiges " were defined by our great lexicographer 
as " illusions, impostures, juggling tricks," and 
we still use the word " prestidigitator " in the 
sense of that old meaning. If to-day prestige 
has come to have something of the connotation 
of reputation, it still suggests its shady past, is 
acquired rather by smartness than by sincerity, 
and " implies nothing more than successful 

Taking as his 



appeal to the imagination." 
starting-point the axiom that 



a newspaper 



must preserve its prestige," and his cue from 
" The Prince," Mr. Smith proceeds, by the use of 
the Machiavellian method, and with much of the 
subtlety of argument displayed by the Floren- 
tine philosopher, to establish his contention in 
behalf of journalistic inerrancy. The editor, no 
less than the absolute prince, must follow the 
rules of his particular game, and prove himself 
quite superior to all considerations of bourgeois 
morality. He is no seeker after truth, but a 
purveyor of notions that are good enough for 
day-by-day consumption. Any other conception 
of his function wovdd speedily relegate him to 
the ranks of academics and idealists. If he 
were to become a victim of the delusion that 
" news " and " facts " had any definite relation- 
ship, he would probably have to be placed under 
restraint. Why, " a serious and persistent pur- 
suit of facts would carry the journalist into the 
field of the historian," and where would then 
be his prestige ? 

Our author's grave and mordant satire may 
be illustrated by the following paragraph : 
" Journalists of the highest mental type develop 
a philosophy which is by no means unknown 
outside of their profession. They hold that 
truth is not ascertainable, and that, if it could 
be ascertained, it would probably be valueless. 
Applied to journalistic problems this theory 
produces very convenient inferences. Since the 
facts which constitute an occurrence can never 
be fully ascertained,one view of the occurrence 
is presumably as good as another. The first 
impression may be modified by a second, but 
the second in turn may be modified by a third ; 
and in many cases, after long investigation, the 
first impression is reestablished. As for edi- 
torial opinions, they are probably sounder and 
assuredly not less sound than other opinions. 
The only value of opinions, in any case, is the 
influence which they exercise upon conduct ; 
and if an editorial opinion makes for desirable 
conduct, it is better than a more deliberate 
judgment which may have undesirable results. 
It follows that there is really no reason why 
any plausible statement should be corrected or 
any laudable opinion modified." It will be 
seen at once that the philosophy of inerrant 
journalism, thus expoimded, is nothing more 
than a special case of pragmatism, and is thus 
brought into line with the ripest wisdom of our 
eminently philosophical age. The journalist 
may well say to the pragmatist, in Juliet's 
words, " Thou hast comforted me marvellous 
much." 

But however industriously journalism may

lay this flattering unction to its soul, there is 
still a fly in the ointment. That bete noire 
is the letter to the editor. It may be sent at 
the most inopportune moment ; it is always 
irritating" ; and, what makes the matter worse, 
it has a certain traditional claim to consider- 
ation. Evidently, the fellow who is ill-advised 
enough to write it must get short shrift, and 
upon this point our philosopher is emphatic. 
Every such petition for justice " must be so 
answered that the petitioner shaU not be likely 
to repeat his offence." He must not be given 
any real satisfaction, for that would encourage 
him to write again, and would also stimulate 
other aggrieved persons to write on other sub- 
jects. Fortunately, the editor has many effec- 
tive ways of rebuking this form of impudence, 
and ways which may be skilfully masked under 
the pretence of fairness. He can set the letter 
in small type, for example, and tuck it into 
some out-of-the-way comer. Or he can put 
it in a conspicuous position, give it a heavy 
face heading which will darken its counsel in 
more than the literal sense, and foUow it by 
a large type reply as scornful and crushing as 
may be necessary. By these easy devices, the 
editor of parts may strengthen the popular belief 
in his omniscience, and establish the doctrine 
of journalistic inerrancy upon an unshakable 
foundation. There is only one real danger, 
which is that the doctrine may harden into a 
dogma, and the editor himself become its victim. 
That way lies disaster, for the consistent practi- 
cal maintainance of the doctrine requires a clear 
head, and the clear-headed editor must know all 
the time that his doctrine is a fiction, and its 
assertion a matter of policy only. 

Mr. Smith plainly recognizes the danger here 
involved, and his last and most solemn words 
are devoted to warning editors against it. The 
rational journalist will, he thinks, confess to an 
error now and then, provided it concern some 
purely trivial matter, for the very purpose of 
strengthening the public faith in his substan- 
tial inerrancy. He may even go so far as to 
dismiss somewhat ostentatiously the reporter 
who is made to shoulder the mistake. " An 
annual dismissal or a triennial retractation, if 
properly staged, would cause the murmurs of 
discontented thousands to pass unheeded." By 
displaying the wisdom of the serpent, "the 
truthfulness and justice of his paper would so 
securely be established that subsequent vigor- 
ous adherence to normal journalistic policy 
would not seriously impair this new prestige 
for many years." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



As OUTBURST OF GERMAN IMAGINAXrVE GENIUS IS 

soon to be witnessed, according to the glad expectation 
of that enthusiastic apostle of Teutonic culture, Professor 
Kimo Francke. In an article on " The New Spirit in 
Grerman Painting," with which the April "Cosmopolitan " 
opens, after vigorously disputing the prevalent notion 
that " the Germany of to-day is given over, body and 
soul, to industrialism and militarism, that the land of the 
poets and thinkers has converted itself into a country of 
money-makers," he maintains that " it would be easy to 
show how erroneous this widespread notion is; how 
deeply astir contemporary Germany is with literary 
and artistic aspiration ; how the spirit of romanticism — 
the same spirit which, at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, led to such works as ' Faust ' and the ' Ninth 
Symphony' — is striding again through the land; how 
there has arisen a new, thoroughly modern, and in- 
tensely alive German drama; how monumental German 
culture has developed a decidedly original and striking 
national style; and how the time seems to be drawing 
near for another great outburst of German imaginative 
genius." This tip-toe attitude of eager expectancy, so 
characteristic of a century's opening, is a subject for 
curious study. Confident expectation is undoubtedly 
one of the factors tending to bring about reaUzation, as 
our psychology makes us believe. How different, then, 
might have been the history of the world if man had 
been created with six fingers instead of five on each 
hand, and had adopted the duodecimal instead of the 
decimal system of notation! His natural longing and 
looking for new and better things with which to begin 
the record of each fresh and untried century would in 
that case have come every one hundred and forty-four 
years instead of every hundred, and we might not now 
be all alert, with the " New Thoughters," for marvellous 
and unimagined spiritual developments, or straining 
eyes and ears, with the star-gazers, for some visible or 
audible message from Mars, or indulging in Utopian 
dreams of a graftless republic where railroad manipu- 
lators cease from troubling and toil-worn muck-rakers 
are at rest. ... 

Pullman-car fiction, each story good for one 
hundred miles of entertainment, is soon to be on sale at 
every important railway news-stand in the land — or in 
the world; for that energetic originator and organizer 
of new enterprises, Mr. Seymour Eaton (of " Book- 
lovers'," « Tabard Inn," and « Teddy Bear " fame), has 
taken the matter in hand and is going to astonish and 
delight the reading public with something new and irre- 
sistibly attractive. He is the founder and president of 
" The Thinkers' Club," described in its prospectus as 
"a sort of clearing house for the thinkers of the 
world," and with him are said to be associated Mr. 
Jidian Hawthorne as vice-president, Mr. Harold Bolce 
as secretary, and Mr. Edwin Liebfreed as treasurer. 
Just what kind of thoughts the Thinkers are going to 
think, one can only conjecture; but as the association is 
apparently formed for book-publishing purposes, it will 
probably need some pretty busy thinking, and some 
equally energetic doing, in these times, to make the 
biisiness succeed. The books to be published will " fill 
the gap between the condensed magazine article and the 
exhaustive and expensive book," and will be of a uni- 
form size and price, — between eight thousand and 
twelve thousand words in length, and sold at twenty-

five cents each. In addition to new works by well-known 
writers, there will also be issued (less wisely, we must 
think) abridged editions of some of the standard works 
of literature. It is expected that by the first of May 
the initial publications of the club will be out, and that 
they will be of a serious character, some of them by 
men who " have been known up to the present time as 
great captains of industry rather than as great writers." 
The Pullman-Car Fiction is to follow a little later.

A LIBRARY SIGN OF THE SEASON is now discernible. 
" The members of the senior class," runs a library 
school news item, "are spending the month in field 
work among the larger public libraries of the state." 
With note-book and pencil in hand, these sharp-eyed 
young persons, filled almost to the bursting point with 
the latest and best instruction in the noble science of 
bibliothecology, and soon to go forth to a waiting world 
and put into execution epoch-making schemes for the 
improvement of our public libraries, now bestow their 
critical attention on the crying needs, the lamentably 
obsolete methods, of the larger libraries in their neigh- 
borhood, and subject the officers of these institutions to 
a searching test as to their professional qualifications 
and their fitness for their positions. " Do you keep a 
shelf-list, and if not, why not ? " " Let us see your 
accessions-list." "Explain your system of ordering." 
" Do you carefully collate each book on its receipt ? " 
" Do you use the Dewey or the Cutter classification ? 
What's that ? You don't use either of them ? Then 
how in the name of the A. L. A. do you ever find a book 
when you want it ? " " Do you make analytical entries 
in cataloguing public documents?" "Explain your 
charging system, please, and let us have samples of 
your membership cards, call-shps, delinquent notices, 
application forms, book-labels, and copies of your latest 
bulletin." Pending this inspection and examination, the 
regular work of the library is intermitted, and all hands 
are mustered as for a fire-drill, the fire coming in a 
raking volley from these pencil-equipped and notebook- 
armed " members of the senior class."

The call of the stage comes irresistibly to many 
young persons who fancy themselves histrionically gifted, 
peculiarly endowed with the dramatic temperament. 
To all such would-be wearers of sock or buskin Miss 
Julia Marlowe addresses some words of advice in a 
recent lecture before the students of Raddiffe College. 
After dwelling on the actor's need of broad culture, and 
after emphasizing the truth that " above all is a know- 
ledge of the fimdamentals of literature indispensable," 
she says: " Scarcely a week passes that I do not receive 
dozens, even hundreds, of letters from young people, 
who tell me that they wish to act and who ask me to 
advise them as to how they shall begin. Almost invari- 
ably the writers of these letters confide to me that they 
have temperament; very, very seldom do any of them 
say that they are taking courses in singing, in gymnastics, 
and above all, in dramatic literature. It would interest 
me much more were they to say that they were doing 
any of these things ; not because they are more import- 
ant or as important as the possession of temperament, 
but because it does not often happen that any person is 
endowed with that rare and imique gift which we call 
temperament. We have all observed that those persons 
who say they have a sense of humor never really have 
it. Its very presence would prevent their dwelling upon 
it. This holds quite as true of persons who have tem- 



perament. Almost never does anyone who thinks he 
has it really possess it. To be sure, most people do 
think they have it. How many, I wonder, in my 
audience to-day, think they have not ? "

The fiction-fed public that patronizes the free 
library is always making moan 'because more novels, 
and more copies of the most popular novels, are not 
bought for its delectation. It is a thirst that will be 
slaked, probably, on the day when the toper turns down 
his glass and declares his craving forever satisfied ; but 
not before. Public libraries turn to this clamor an ear 
of varying degrees of deafness. The Boston library, 
for example, has in three consecutive years purchased 
129, 161, and 167 novels from the great mass of current 
English fiction examined by its committee. The city of 
Trenton, N.J. (we cite the instance as the strongest 
possible contrast), added to its public library in the last 
year, if the Seventh Annual Report is to be trusted, no 
fewer than 1882 works of fiction, its purchases of other 
books being only 357 in excess of this number, and its 
total of volumes on the shelves not quite forty thousand. 
It circulated 131,244 works of fiction, besides 54,284 
juvenile books — how many of the latter were story- 
books is not reported, but one could venture a tolerable 
guess. In non-fiction, 25,495 volumes were drawn. 
The Trenton library maintains an excellent open-shelf 
reference department and permits an almost limitless 
borrowing of serious works on one card ; but, unless we 
have misread its Report, it believes in feeding the 
imagination with fiction more unstintedly than any 
other public library of which we have knowledge.

The income from literary work is always a 
matter of interest, possibly because the attempt to live 
by writing prose or verse, like the attempt to live 
by himting and fishing, appeals to our sense of sport. 
The writer's chase of that rare, wild animal, the five- 
franc piece, has all the excitement and precariousness 
and high-bred scorn of danger of the hunter's trade. 
Probably no man's gains are so usually over-estimated 
as the author's. Mr. Laurence Hutton some years ago 
gave the public a glimpse into his profit account which 
must have been surprising to people who think of liter- 
ature as a prosperous profession. Mr. William M. 
Rossetti in his volumes " Some Reminiscences " is more 
explicit. He says that between 1869 and 1894 his 
literary income averaged about one hundred pounds 
a year. This was the period when he was very much 
in the public eye by reason of a multitude of articles 
and essays and not a few published books. Estimating 
by reputation and influence, one would have supposed 
his receipts to have been ten times this amount. For- 
tunately, like so many Englishmen of letters, he held a 
government post which secured him a competent income. 
There is no pose in his straightforward biogi-aphy, but 
one can read through the lines that he was the good 
angel of the House of Rossetti, exemplary in his duties 
as a son, brother, and father. That a writer so widely 
known and so industrious could only clear the meagre 
amount stated above is a revelation.

A CLOSE parallelism exists between Alfred de 
Musset's " Night of December " — the most sombre of 
the four " Nights " — and Poe's powerful tale, "William 
Wilson." In both a man is haunted from childhood to 
middle age by a figure which changes as he changes and 
which finally turns out to be a projection of himself. 



1908.]

The " Night " was written in November, 1835, and may 
very well have been known to Poe. Of course the 
idea was not new with de Musset. In Calderon's 
"Purgatory of St. Patrick" there is a creation — 
Embozado — which dogs the hero's steps, embarrasses 
him by appearance, confronts him again and again, until 
he turns upon it with drawn sword, when it drops its 
mask and cloak and stands there, the man himself. In 
the original legend upon which Calderon embroidered, 
the idea was of pieces of paper which kept dropping from 
the sky at a man's feet and upon each of which he found 
inscribed his own name. One of Gdngora's ballads has 
a similar motive. A man is on his way to an assignation 
with a nun. A funeral procession with lighted candles 
crosses his path. He follows it. The train enters a 
church and the bier is deposited before the altar. He 
approaches it and draws the cloth from the dead man's 
face — and beholds his own. The idea has been used 
by Rossetti in both picture and verse, and, of course, by 
Hawthorne and Stevenson ; but de Musset's beautiful 
development of it is probably less known. 
• • • 
Population growth axd book-circulation 
GROWTH do not always proceed pari passu. It is 
encouraging to find in the public library report, just 
issued, of a typical New England city — a not excep- 
tionally intellectual city, and one too near the great 
libraries of Boston to serve as an ideal example — that 
while during the last twenty years the population has 
increased by about two hundred and seventeen per cent, 
the home circulation of the library has grown three 
hundred and four per cent ; and the total use of Ubrary 
books shows a gain of three hundred and fifty-four per 
cent. "These figures indicate," continues the report 
(of the Maiden, Mass., public library), " that the use of 
the library by the people has become more general, and 
that it has outstripped the growth of the city, even though 
a supply of the most ephemeral and worthless popular 
literature has not been provided." We know, from 
personal inspection, that the Ubrary 's purchases of books 
have been, in general, governed by wisdom. " It has 
not been the policy of the management," says President 
D. P. Corey, of the Board of Trustees, " to increase the 
circulation by sensational appeals and methods and an 
apparent activity that is superficial rather than real. . . . 
Adapting the words of a recent writer, the library has 
given attention to 'the strengthening of its simple 
primary functions rather than to the invention of new 
schemes to attract more patrons,' thus avoiding the 
danger of giving an inadequate service in many varied 
activities, some of which may be of no real benefit to 
the pubhc." A wise conservatism, this, and one that 
has produced good results.

Meredithian ECHOES, the dying reverberations of 
plaudits and huzzas raised in celebration of the octoge- 
narian novelist's birthday, continue to strike on the ear 
from various quarters. American admiration of Mr. 
Meredith is recognized by the editor of the London 
" Book Monthly " in a pleasant article describing his 
visit to Boxhill on the veteran writer's eightieth birth- 
day. " For years," he says, " American admirers of 
Mr. Meredith have found their way to Boxhill — more 
Americans than English, — and in his frank, kindly way 
he has received them, if only to say how glad he was to 
do so." This preponderance of trans-Atlantic visitors 
illustrates again the attraction lent by distance to the 
view. It is not the Boston! an who climbs Bunker Hill 



Monument, or the Philadelphian who makes a practice 
of spending his Sunday afternoon at the grave of 
Franklin ; but the stranger from Kalamazoo and Oshkosh 
insists on these things as of the first importance. But 
apart from the mere fascination of the remote, Amer- 
ican recognition of European genius has ever been 
prompt and generous — a discernment of which we 
have reason to be proud. It is a pleasure to learn from 
the " Book Monthly " that Mr. Meredith " is as brilliant 
as ever in intellect, and his voice still has the music 
of the spheres, as Gladstone's and Queen Victoria's had 
unto the last." ... 

Preparations for the Milton tercentenary, to 
be held in London next December, are now in progress. 
Preluding that main performance comes the exhibition 
of important Miltoniana at the Columbia University 
Libi-ary — a display which, in unique items, is said to be 
unsurpassable even in the poet's own country. Through 
Professor Simkhovitch's zealous efforts has been gath- 
ered together a great array of first and other rare 
editions of Milton's writings, with other relics dear to 
the bibliophile and to the antiquary. Of chief interest 
is the original printer's manuscript, with the official 
Hcense, of the first book of « Paradise Lost." This 
manuscript — thirty-three quarto pages in the hand- 
writing of the blind poet's amanuensis — is a part of the 
" copy " from which Peter Parker in 1667 prmted for 
Samuel Simmons, holder of the copyright, the early 
editions of the poem. On the inside of a leaf at the 
beginning is the license, in autograph, of the Rev. 
Thomas Tomkyns, press censor of the period. So far 
as is known, this is the sole surviving fragment of the 
original manuscript of the great epic; and it is not 
surprising that it brought £5000 at private sale four 
years ago. What bit of inked paper, unless it might 
be an autograph copy of a Shakespeare sonnet or play, 
would the lover of English literature value more highly ? 
Its present owner is Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan.

The Puritan father of Mr. Edmund Gosse may 
possibly not have been so ungenial a specimen of father- 
hood as the reader has been led to infer from the pages 
of that remarkable book, "Father and Son." Those 
who are curious in this matter and can gain access 
to " Longmans' Magazme " for March, 1889, will find 
there a contribution from the pen of Philip Henry 
Gosse, F.R.S. (the " father " of the book), entitled " A 
Country Day-School Seventy Years Ago." A corre- 
spondent of the London « Athenseum " calls attention to 
this article as being " full of humor and knowledge of 
boy life, and not at all priggish or Puritanical." He 
adds that " the stories of school life therein show that 
the writer thoroughly understood it, and make the 
reader wonder if the ' Father ' did not understand the 
' Son ' better than the Son now thinks he did, and was 
quite so severe or mirthless as the book would make 
one fancy." Yet the child's impressions, deep and 
lasting, were what they were ; and whatever the charm 
of this article written in the mellowness of age, one 
must believe that it was an austere experience to which 

the boy was subjected.

When the librarian of the Yamaguchi (Japan) Public 
Library asked our government for the latest information 
concerning the best means of reaching country districts 
with library books, he was referred to this Hagerstown 
library as a model for his study. This and many other 
interesting facts are set forth in the 1906-7 report of 
the library, wherein is announced the remarkable achieve- 
ment of having circulated 91,856 volumes with a total 
of 18,095 with which to do it — an average of more 
than five lendings per volume. Besides the central 
building, there are seventy-one deposit stations through- 
out the county; thirty-nine schools are also in receipt 
of books; and the book- wagon visited fifteen of the 
remoter villages. The Report, with its eight attractive 
illustrations, is a credit to the library.

Chinese ideographs, which have not only served 
the literary needs of China herself for centuries, but 
have also proved a potent mstrument in enabling Japan

increasing extent, to the alphabet used by the western 
world. At a late meeting in Tokio of the promoters of 
this desirable substitution. Count Okuma made an ani- 
mated address in its favor. As a mere matter of fiscal 
economy, the removal of this barrier to international 
communication would save the Empire a large annual 
outlay for clerks and copyists whose functions would 
cease with the introduction of alphabetic writing and 
printing. It is curious to note the coincidence of this 
movement with the invention of an elaborate and ingen- 
ious ideograph type-writer (if that is not a contradiction 
in terms); but the native symbols are likely long to 

remain in home use.

To LOVERS OF THE LeATHERSTOCKING TaLES it will

or marble statue of this first great American romancer. 
The committee feels that it is high time, and the right

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



AN UNREACHED GOAL. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The impulse to translate a charming thing into one's 
mother-tongue will continue to assert itself as long as 
the world has more languages than one. As regularly 
it will be chilled by the knowledge that either some 
evaporation of the essence or some deviation from the 
form is certain to occur in the process, even under 
the best conditions. But again and again the impulse 



has its way — defending itself by the claim that other- 
wise the treasure must be wholly unknown to many a 
reader. 

Here follows an attempt to reproduce in English a 
" very perfect little thing " of which Professor Saints- 
bury gives the original in his " Periods of European 
Literature: Later Nineteenth Century." Of its author, 
the Austrian Baroness Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, he 
says : " She cannot be missed as among the most un- 
doubted possessors of really poetic spirit who have 
written in German during the last half century." And 
upon the poem he makes this comment : "It will be 
observed that this has not only the right German senti- 
ment, but is a most happy exemplification of the poetic 
capacities of the German tongue itself, in the repeated 
sighings or breathings of the final e in the last line, with 
the full vowel sound of the preceding syllables contrast- 
ing, supporting, and embellishing them. In much read- 
ing of modern German verse, it will not be easy to find an 
example of equal scale better in itself, or better illustrat- 
ing the unforced and natural character of the best work 
of the same kind in the same country." 

" Ein kleines Lied, wie geht's nur an, 
Dass man so lieb ea haben kann, 
Was liegt darin ? Erzable ! 

Es liegt darin ein wenig Klang, 
Ein wenig Wohllaut und Gesang — 
Und eine ganze Seele ! " 



A tiny song — O, what 's the art 
That makes it dear to every heart ? 
I wait now for your telling. 

A song is something that can ring — 
A little melody and swing • — 

And a whole soul there indwelling ! 

Now will some other contributor be inspired to make 
a more felicitous effort toward attaining the unattain- 
able ? If so, the Baroness von Ebner-Eschenbach's 
publishers, the Gebriider Paetel of Berlin, will surely 
give the same permission to print the newer version 
in America which they have granted to the present 
translator. Katharine H. Austin.

VARIATIONS IN LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The communication in your issue of Feb. 1, by 
Thomas H. Briggs, on " Problems of the Smaller 
Libraries," must necessarily appeal very strongly to 
librarians who do not have at their disposal larger 
libraries to consult. There is such possibility for an 
diversity of opinion as to how a book may be classified 
under the Dewey Decimal System that one is often at 
a loss to know exactly where to place a new publication. 
My attention is particularly called to this fact relative 
to James's «* Pragmatism." Three catalogues listing 
the monthly additions to the libraries, published by 
prominent libraries in the East, each give a different 
classification for this book. One has "190, Modern 
Philosophers"; one "191, American Philosophers"; 
one " 199, Other Modem Philosophers." Still another 
catalogue gives it as " 150, Mental faculties. Psychol- 
ogy." The uninitiated is often at a loss to know where 
he is " at." G. R. H.

A Noteworthy Tilden Aetebmath.* 

The nonagenarian editor of the " Letters and 
Literary Memorials of Samuel J. Tilden " finds 
himself on familiar ground, dealing as he does 
with political history and biography all of which 
he saw, so far as a contemporary could, and part 
of which he was — a considerable part, too, first 
and last. Mr. John Bigelow, the senior executor 
of Tilden's will, the author of a standard Life of 
the man, and the editor of a selection from his 
writings and speeches, which was published the 
year before Mr. Tilden's death, has had the sift- 
ing of a mountain of manuscript in the twenty- 
two years since the testator's will was opened 
and it was foimd that its forty-second clause 
provided for the publication of such further 
papers as his trustees and executors should judge 
worthy of preservation in book form. 

In all that he wrote, even in the composition 
of his school exercises and the penning of the 
most informal letter or note, Tilden seems to 
have had posterity before his mind's eye ; his 
utterances were addressed, one might almost say 
primarily addressed, to an audience beyond the 
grave. He took his life and his doings with 
tremendous seriousness. The editor accounts 
for this in part by the fact that even as a youth 
he had, by both pen and speech, won the re- 
spectful attention of the leading statesmen of 
the day. At school, we are told, " he preserved 
all his composition exercises, and from that time 
to the close of his life it may well be doubted if 
he ever wrote a note or document of any kind 
of which he did not preserve the draft or copy." 
Small wonder, therefore, that the accumulated 
manuscript dealing with its writer's fifty years 
of active public life should have to be measured 
by the cord and weighed by the ton. In the some- 
what grandiloquent language of the editor, — 
" The duty imposed upon his executors of looking 
through such a vast collection of papers and selecting 
such as would be profitable for publication has been a 
long and a very tedious one. They indulge the hope, 
however, that the volumes now submitted will be found

tic proportions of one of the most gifted statesmen our 
country has produced."

that of Israel's second king in being a life of 
almost constant warfare — a warfare that made 
him more or less liable to be viewed with par- 
tisan eyes and judged with but partial justice. 
The passage of time is necessary for the true 
perspective ; and so, continues the editor, with 
another Biblical illustration, " we only see a 
public man as he is entitled to be seen, as Moses 
was permitted to see his Lord : after he had 
passed," These and other passages in Mr. 
Bigelow's preface leave the reader fully confi- 
dent that the words and acts of Mr. Tilden will 
have no editorial construction put upon them 
that might seem harshly unjust to his admirers. 
He is in tender hands. Perhaps the strongest 
note of anything like disapproval is struck in 
the following commentary on- his view of the 
slavery question in 1853 : 

« It was at this stage of Pierce's administration that 
Tilden began to indulge in the deplorable error of walk- 
ing by sight and not by faith. He did not believe, nor 
did he ever again seem to comprehend, that in the 
slave States all other questions, even the Constitution 
of our government and the integrity of our territory, 
were subordinate throughout the South to the preserva- 
tion and extension of slavery; that every person who 
ventured publicly to express a doubt of the wisdom of 
allowing slavery to extend to the free Territories was 
pronounced there a suspect, and was proscribed as a per- 
son who tainted every one who associated with him 
politically. The Nullifiers saw, and saw correctly, that 
the anti-slavery sentiment could only be resisted in 
America as heresy was resisted by Louis XIV. in 
France — by crushing the heretics or driving them from 
the country. To reason with Pierce [as Tilden had done 
in a letter evoking this comment] in favor of dispensing 
his patronage in the State of New York in accordance 
with the public opinion of the State, was as idle as the 
lamb's reasoning with the wolf in the fable." 

To illustrate the cardinal events in Tilden's 
public life, such as his part in the Tweed Ring 
exposures and his trying experience as presi- 
dential candidate, one would have liked, and 
would have expected, to find many letters from 
his pen giving an intimate view of his opinions 
and feelings ; but though friendly and admiring 
tributes in abundance from his correspondents 
are printed, there seems to have been at the 
editor's disposal a far less ample supply of 
answers to these correspondents. At any rate, 
just what we most curiously look for at these 
interesting periods we fail to discover. As a 
specimen of his letter-writing, the following 
sufficiently self-explanatory paragraph, from a 
note to Eugene Casserly, dated July 3, 1872, 
has an interest to those old enough to remember 
the political situation of that time : 

" The Cincinnati movement has been so early and 
long encouraged by you and by me and by many who 
thought with us, that it grew to have an impetus and

volume which were important and not easily turned 
aside from the channel it made for itself. Our people, 
in being educated to favor it, had become accustomed 
to count on it, and at last became dependent upon it. 
I never saw how its acts were capable of readjustment, 
or how the question now before us would be other than 
the simple issue between Grant and Greeley. On this 
I concur with the instinctive sense of our people that a 
change is necessary in the Federal administration. It 
is rarely, if ever, possible for a party in office to reform 
itself by the internal force of its best elements. We 
must have a better state of thuigs in national, State, and 
municipal government, and a higher standard in the 
public mind by which official men will be tried and to 
which they will refer in their silent meditations and in 
their actions, if we would preserve anything of value in 
our political system." 

Coming down a few years later, we find many 
cordially sympathetic and eulogistic communica- 
tions to the man counted out by the Electoral Com- 
mission called upon to decide a memorable dispute. 
Letters from General McClellan, Mr. Charles 
Francis Adams, and Mr. Abram S. Hewitt are 
especially noteworthy. Mr. Adams writes : 

"On this day [March 5, 1877] when you ought to 
have been the President of these United States, I seize 
the opportunity to bear my testimony to the calm and 
dignified manner in which you have passed through this 
great trial. It is many years since I ceased to be a 
party man. Hence I have endeavored to judge of 
public affairs and men rather by their merits than by 
the names they take. It is a source of gratification to 
me to think that I made the right choice in the late 
election. I could never have been reconciled to the 
elevation by the smallest aid of mine of a person, how- 
ever respectable in private life, who must forever carry 
upon his brow the stamp of fraud first triumphant in 
American history. No subsequent action, however 
meritorious, can wash away the letters of that record." 

Every page of these volumes will be inter- 
esting to those whose favorite reading and study 
is in the political history of our country, and 
especially interesting if they have lived through 
the years, or any considerable part of them, 
covered by the correspondence and other occa- 
sional writings selected for publication. These 
documents reveal a mind shrewd, alert, judicial, 
delighting in argument but not in heated debate, 
and always maintaining a certain cool dignity 
and reserve even where a little show of heat or 
even irritation might have been not out of place. 
Amid the many and illustrious names of states- 
men and diplomats with which the pages are 
sprinkled, it is pleasant now and then — but 
the occasions are extremely rare — to come 
across a name known in literature. That of 
Hawthorne lights up one page, by the merest 
accident, and that of Bryant another. In its 
very manner of expression, its choice of words, 
the poet-editor's note, brief though it is, forms 
a refreshing contrast to the invariably formal 



and correct (and sometimes turgidly platitud- 
inous) deliverances of those other great ones 
whose capable hands were more occupied in 
moulding the destinies of nations than in pen- 
ning letters that should live and breathe to after 
generations by reason of that unfailing preserva- 
tive of written speech — charm of style. " I 
have called at your office twice to-day on some 
business of my own," writes Bryant. " WiU 
you oblige me by letting me know when you are 
in your office, that I may come and bore you ? " 
That is all, but it is enough to make one search 
the subsequent pages for some reference to the 
boring, when (or if) it actually took place. But 
the name, having once emerged to cheer the 
vision, comes not again to the surface in any but 
the most casual and unsatisfactory manner. 

The appreciation of Mr. Tilden contributed 
to " The Atlantic Monthly " in 1892 by the 
late James Coolidge Carter is reprinted as an 
introduction to the letters. It is curious to note, 
in the brief reference to Tilden's governorship, a 
situation closely paralleled to-day by a state of 
affairs not a thousand miles from Albany. The 
Tammany Hall leaders, scenting danger in the 
Governor's reform plans, united with the so- 
called Canal Ring in a vigorous warfare against 
him, and he found himself in peril of being 
deserted by a majority of his own party. 

" The Democratic Speaker of the Assembly took the 
floor and arraigned him as unfaithful to the Democracy 
of the State. He had long before seen the possibility 
of this combination against him, and had sought by the 
practice of all the conciliatory arts of which he was a 
thorough master, to prevent it. When it came, he was 
not daunted by it, but boldly went behind his enemies 
to the constituencies which they were betraying. They 
soon found that they were dealing with an adversary 
who possessed resources which they had not taken into 
account. Most of them abandoned their opposition. 
The rest were severely dealt with by their constituents." 

The work as a whole is an important and his- 
torically valuable supplement to Mr. Bigelow's 
earlier publications in the same field.

In the Scales of Academic Criticism.* 



Through the last few decades every page 
of academic literary criticism appearing in En- 
gland has shown the influence of the talented 
author of the Causeries du Lundi. The avowed 
discipleship of Matthew Arnold, who proved 
himself a follower at once loving and militant, 
would have sufficed in itself to spread the gospel

of the brilliant Gallic master ; and all the oper- 
ating causes have come dangerously near turn- 
ing him into une religion anglaise, if we may 
modify one of his own references to Chau- 
teaubriand. Nor, on the whole, is the homage 
undeserved ; for with his contributions criticism 
entered upon a newer and higher life. After 
the achievements of Sainte-Beuve, it was clear 
once for all that criticism " must never be con- 
tent with the mere study of outward conditions, 
sources, and influences ; but must use these only 
to press on to the discovery of what each artist, 
inalienably, uniquely, brings — of that within 
him which determines what influences he shall 
accept." The impotent ponderosity of unimagi- 
native erudition and the arrogant self-confidence 
of half -trained intuition will not soon die all in 
all ; but they have been robbed of most of 
their power. Unreasoning vituperation has been 
driven from the field, although, unfortunately, 
it has not seldom been replaced by an equally 
unreasoning amiability. Even this insipidity, 
however, has felt the new life, and will soon be 
as innocuous as it is ridicidous. A sane scien- 
tific method, based upon sound scholarship and 
enhanced by imaginative appreciation, has been 
bequeathed to us by the " greatest of literary 
historians." In his opening address at the Uni- 
versity of Liege, in 1848, he said : 

"Les etudes positives et s^v^res sont la base de tout 
Acqu^rez le solide. . . . Mais k cot^, mais au-dessus, 
laissez place k un jjeu de fantaisie, si elle veut naitre, — 
k la flamme sur le front d' lule, — uon pas sur le front 
seulement, mais dans le cceur." 

And these words have always seemed to us 
strikingly applicable to the master who uttered 
them. The reference to lulus recalls his sound 
and indispensable knowledge of the classics ; 
the " exacting studies " suggest his accurate 
scholarship and his minute patient training in 
method ; the demand for " un peu de fantaisie" 
points toward his penetrating and illuminating 
imagination. Such a leader was worthy of his 
most distinguished followers. 

In Professor Elton's volume of " Modern 
Studies," the spirit of Sainte-Beuve is unob- 
trusively but persistently present. The author 
appreciates fully the inevitable classic criticism 
of such a man as Hazlitt. Like most of us, he 
turns with special eagerness to the judgments 
passed by a craftsman upon his fellows ; and he 
rightly places Mr. Swinburne's literary verdicts 
high in the scale, despite " their enormous 
panegyric or superlative damnation." But 
primarily our author represents the academic 
school with which we began. Naturally, there 
is no trace in his pages either of journalism 



masquerading as criticism, or of the scintillating 
pertness of the Shaw or Chesterton type. 
Neither do we find the more pardonable, more 
ambitious, paradox of Oscar Wilde, that criti- 
cism is superior to creativeness ; although to 
the former. Professor Elton assigns no lowly 
functions. He believes that criticism should 
be keen and incisive, and forward-moving, if 
we may be pardoned the expression. It must 
be absolutely impartial to the writer ; must be 
rationally based ; and, above all, must quicken, 
instead of deaden, the literary instinct in the 
reader. In this spirit Professor Elton has 
written upon such themes as "Recent Shake- 
speare Criticism," " Mr. Swinburne's Poems," 
"Mr. George Meredith," "Living Irish Lit- 
erature," and so forth. Two or three of the 
essays in the collection are not primarily literary 
criticism, notably the important and attractive 
treatment of "Giordano Bruno in England"; 
but for most readers the interest of the volume 
will be due to the qualities above suggested. 

The author's general outlook is perhaps most 
definitely suggested by the section on " The 
Meaning of Literary History." Herein the 
central tenet is that "literature, being an art, 
must belong to the world and disown the quar- 
rels of the nations." While the thought is not 
new, our author has ably worked it out with 
reference to present conditions, and with a pleas- 
ing freedom from vagaries. He does not fall 
into the idtimately philistine mistake of desiring 
that the nations shall be in accord on all points, 
and speak with one literary voice. And we 
gladly note his concession that variety is a vital 
necessity for art, whereof the aim is to give plea- 
sure through beauty, by realizing " in unique 
unchanging form the spirit of the individual." 
Knowledge is international or nothing ; science 
is impersonal and above race ; but literature 
neither can nor should altogether escape national 
limitations. Difference of language is one very 
tangible barrier. 

" The inner cell of the poet's mind is not hung with 
charts or diagrams of doctrine that are equally true or 
false in every idiom. It is peopled with wandering 
times that seek their appointed thought, and lonely 
phrases that seek a completing cadence, until at last, 
from some chance union that eludes all our psychology, 
the immortal word is born. And this cannot be trans- 
ferred to another tongue." 

But in the face of all difficulties, literature must 
strive to be cosmopolitan. 

" It must join with education and science, the forces 
that unite, and not with those that, serve for estrange- 
ment, such as racial distrust and war; or civilization 
wastes a chance." 

The essay then goes on to discuss the changing 



208 



THE DIAL 



[AprH 1, 



ideals of literary history, and to point out the 
growth of the study of literature from the inter- 
national side in France, Italy, Germany, and 
"the States." In this connection, Columbia 
University receives a well-deserved tribute for 
its " series of books — not little theses, but 
books — on various aspects of Tudor litera- 
ture." Such intelligent collaboration appeals 
with force to Professor Elton, and he looks 
forward very eagerly to its spreading in the 
mother country. However, there is no undue 
deference to " the States," for he feels that on 
the whole the Englishman has a more rational 
schooling than the more enterprising American, 
and writes a better and fresher style ; so that 
the results would be correspondingly more valu- 
able if the system of collaboration were once 
set in motion. The paper concludes with some 
short chapters in review of Dr. Courthope's 
" History of English Poetry " and Professor 
Saintsbury's" Short History of English Liter- 
ature." Throughout the reviews, Professor 
Elton succeeds in bringing his authors into 
relation with his central subject, while passing 
careful criticism upon their books. With refer- 
ence to the " Short History," we may steal 
space to venture the deliberate opinion that it 
is rated by our critic considerably higher than 
it deserves. However, " the catholic connois- 
seurship" of Professor Saintsbury, even if not 
infrequently fallible, does associate itself help- 
fully with the idea of a federal literature in 
which Professor Elton is so laudably interested. 

The inaugural lecture on Tennyson and the 
review of the collected edition of Mr. Swin- 
burne's poems exhibit our author's critical 
method, and at the same time support one of 
the fimdamental tenets voiced in the section 
we have been discussing. Being an academic 
critic, he naturally concedes the necessity of 
understanding " certain impersonal forces, which 
from age to age tend to prescribe the form and 
aim of poetry and to beleaguer it about." 

" They play upon each artist in difFerent proportions, 
fitfully and with no steady pressure. But there are 
other forces that he beyond analysis, namely, those 
which move the artist and decide how he shall choose 
among these floating tendencies in the mind of his time, 
how he shall combine or alter them, what he shall accept 
of them. Tendencies, it naust be repeated, have no real 
existence, except in the shapes in which the individual 
mind chooses to submit to them. . . . The mind is not 
a cauldron in which certain ingredients simmer mechani- 
cally, so that a certain result can be expected. No; 
the Time-Spirit says a charm over the cauldron, and 
imborn shapes arise out of it; it is only a third-rate 
writer who can be analysed away into ' influences.' " 

The juxtaposition of the articles on the two 



antithetical Victorians may have been acci- 
dental ; but it remains a felicitous auxiliary of 
the above contention. Many of the " imper- 
sonal forces " acting upon Tennyson and Mr. 
Swinburne were identical ; but the Zeitgeist 
has seldom evoked more dissimilar shapes from 
his cauldron. At heart, the late Laureate was 
in sympathy with the " stable, immemorial, 
dignified English society." His younger con- 
temporary found his keenest life in the ringing 
revolutionary cry that centred about Mazzini. 
Tennyson was ever anxious to make the new 
wine of nineteenth century thought enter peace- 
fully into the old bottles of accepted religion. 
Mr. Swinburne would not merely allow the old 
bottles to sink quietly into disuse, — he would 
burst them even dramatically, and would fairly 
bathe in the new wine as in his beloved sea. 
And so the contrast might be carried on, until the 
two poets should be seen in almost antipodean 
opposition. Such expressions as " a child of his 
age " or " an inevitable product of environment " 
have been thrown about most profusely since the 
application of science to literature; but they 
would seem to require pretty careful weighing 
if they are to retain much real meaning. And 
this is one of the principal values of such work 
as is contained in the present volume ; for Pro- 
fessor Elton never loses sight of individual per- 
sonalities in the influences operating upon them. 

Furthermore, his estimate of these two 
makers of verse seems to us thoroughly sane, 
and as nearly adequate as the compulsory brev- 
ity of his treatment would permit. The almost 
reverent attitude toward Tennyson has made 
it not altogether easy to assert his weaknesses. 
The height of his purpose, the purity of his life, 
the quiet dignity of his individuality, the great- 
ness of his character, united to make his beauti- 
ful poetry seem more nearly perfect than it was. 
But when all the garlands are bestowed, the fact 
remains that much of his work is marred by 
what the Germans call Halbheit. Compromise 
may have been the secret of England's parlia- 
mentary strength ; but it is not the essence of 
final poetry. And this our author insists upon, 
without belittling the exceptional services of 
the poet or failing to applaud his wonderfid 
achievements. Into his more detailed criticism 
we may not enter ; but here, likewise, the scales 
are held in admirable balance. 

To Mr. Swinburne's poetry we shall long 
turn for his young-hearted yearning toward 
beauty and his determined will to learn its 
meaning; for his unequalled voicing of the 
mysterious but inevitable amor mortis that

THE DIAL

sways and perturbs every adolescent heart ; for 
his desperate love of liberty and his moral passion 
for mankind, as seen in the poems of the Mazzini 
period. He has helped us more than any other 
modem Englishman to understand that " the 
emotions of fraternity and self-sacrifice and ulti- 
mate hope are the lyric poet's true material." 
Many who cannot love the soul of his poetry 
must admire the form in which it is embodied. 
The infinite musical resource of his metres is 
almost incredible. And yet, when all this is 
conceded, we may acquiesce in Professor Elton's 
judicial verdict that 

" Much of Mr. Swinburne's song and lyric for twenty- 
years has been performance rather than creation. No 
one else could write it; it is sincere; but it perishes like 
the scud or the cloud-wreath, in the act of formation. 
His true power during that long interval lies in prose 
and drama." 

Even in moral feeling, as well as in effect, the 
rebellious poet might have gained if he could 
have escaped a certain lack of measure in assail- 
ing some of his favorite antipathies. As a 
caustic reviewer said some years ago, he might 
have been less bitter toward God and Mr. 
Gladstone. With his striking merits and defects 
before us, it would be unwise to hazard very con- 
fident vaticinations about his treatment at the 
hands of the future. 

" The fame of a profuse and unequal and unresting 
writer has of necessity to wait longer than that of one 
who, like Dante Grabriel Rossetti, winnows his work and 
saves only that which possesses the utmost intensity and 
perfection, and who is thus his own anthologist. Yet 
the ultimate garland of the more spendthrift singer may 
prove to be not less in quantity, as it will certainly not 
rank lower in beauty of its own noble order." 

In our present mood we should not hesitate to 
say that Mr. Swinburne will rank higher than 
his fellow-singer of the brotherhood ; but the 
conservatism of the quoted verdict may be 
sounder, as it is certainly safer. 

The other sections we must regretfully leave 
undiscussed. " Recent Shakespeare Criticism " 
and " Living Irish Literature " will particularly 
repay careful reading. " Colour and Imagery 
in Spenser "is by no means on a level with the 
other papers. Nor is " Literary Fame : A 
Renaissance Note " quite worthy of its best com- 
panions because of a little suggestion of " the 
thesis factory," albeit we shoidd immediately add 
that the factory is of an exceptionally high type. 

Professor Elton's style answers to the de- 
mands we have a right to make upon an able 
critic who occupies an important chair of 
English Literature. He never fails to write 
clearly ; he is not afraid to write finely. Rarely 
is there any noticeable infelicity ; but inasmuch 1 



as his ear is so thoroughly familiar with " Maud " 
we might have expected him to avoid such an 
annoying false echo as " that with which no 
fault can be foimd, except that it is faultlessly 
null." The slip would be negligible in a less 
competent writer, and the very fact of our 
mentioning it may indicate the paucity of vul- 
nerable points. There is, however, a remote 
possibility of pedantry shadowed forth by the 
frequent use of proper adjectives or kindred 
devices. Thus, in six lines we have : 

"Certainly Bruno's Platonism misses the note of 
chivalry. His Rabelaisian fulness of life, which utters 
itself in his spendthrift eloquence, carries him far from 
his contemporary Tasso. He lacks Shakespeare's con- 
ception of love, just as he misses the strain of saintliness • 
that is heard in Spenser. Love to him is now a gaily 
Lampsacene appetite," etc. 

But in the other essays this tendency is less 
marked, and inasmuch as the Bruno paper will 
be attractive primarily to the scholarly inclined, 
the trait is interesting rather than important. 

To any reader who has followed this notice, 
it will be clear that we are inclined to place a 
rather high value upon this latest volume by 
Professor Elton. His traditions of literary 
criticism are the best ; his appreciation of the 
growing importance of natural science in the 
literary field is significant of his keen and for- 
ward vision ; his advocacy of comparative lit- 
erature must win unhesitating approval ; his 
outlook on life is clear and wide ; his sym- 
pathies are at once advanced and catholic. It 
is not often that a collection of essays reprinted 
from contemporary magazines will be found to 
offer such satisfying mental pabulum.

Cais^ada and the Thirteen Colonies.* 



In the preface to his latest book. Professor 
Justin H. Smith refers to a criticism brought 
against his " Troubadours at Home," that he 
had taken pains to be " interesting," and to his 
own defence, that certain phases of his subject 
were essentially of such a nature that no account 
of them could be lifelike — that is to say, true 
— if it were not interesting. He anticipates a 
similar charge in the case of his present book, 
and repeats his former defence. " But," he adds, 
" the intention has been to keep the requirements 
of critical investigation steadily in mind, and 
accept literary elements only for their sound

historical worth." Until one has read his book 
— that is, the book now under consideration — 
this use of the word " interesting " is puzzling. 
Thereafter, its application may be seen, but the 
term remains somewhat misleading. Surely no 
reviewer could wish the presentation of history 
to be anything but " interesting"? The point 
to which criticism was presumably directed in 
the " Troubadours at Home," and to which it is 
more definitely applicable in " Our Struggle for 
the Fourteenth Colony," is not the fact that Dr. 
Smith's treatment of his subjects has been made 
interesting, but rather the means by which that 
attractive quality was sought. 

It is open to grave question if the " literary 
elements " invoked by Dr. Smith in the present 
instance are always marked by " sound histor- 
ical worth." Even the undeniable charm of 
Parkman cannot blind us to the fact that occa^ 
sionaUy his desire for a picturesque or effective 
background clashed with his stern devotion 
to historic truth. And where Parkman has 
stumbled, others are likely to fall. In his 
laudable effort to reconstruct an exceedingly 
interesting period of Colonial history, Dr. Smith 
has made large and constant demands upon his 
imagination ; so much so that some of his chap- 
ters run perilously into the dangerous border- 
land between history and fiction, if they do 
not actually enter the territory of the latter. 
History is written nowadays for two fairly 
distinct classes — the general reader and the 
student. The man capable of satisfying both 
is a rare genius, bom to the purple. The 
average historian who attempts to fill the double 
role, is doomed to failure. If content with the 
modest appreciation of students, he will build 
upon facts and facts alone, though there is no 
reason why his building should not be attract- 
ive and " interesting." On the other hand, if 
he aspires to the loud applause of the multi- 
tude, he is free to imagine his facts and build 
upon that airy foundation a glittering palace of 
words. 

One must hasten to say that Dr. Smith can- 
not be classed, except to a limited extent, with 
the latter group of writers. In the main his 
work reveals the most painstaking study of 
original documents. It is, in all seriousness, a 
monument of patient research, and unquestion- 
ably throws a great deal of new light upon the 
history of the attempt to win Canada to the 
cause of the Thirteen Colonies. Where material 
was available in any form. Dr. Smith has spared 
no possible pains to get at it ; and, with few 
exceptions, his interpretation has been all that 



the most exacting critic could demand. It is 
only where the documents were not available — 
where they had been lost, or had never existed — 
that he (one cannot but think imadvisedly) fell 
back upon his imagination, and created scenes, 
incidents, or statements which might have hap- 
pened, but which there is no sufficient evidence 
to prove did happen. One need not go beyond 
the first few pages to find a case in point. The 
scene is the historic meeting in Faneuil Hall in 
February, 1775. The historian admits that " if 
any records of the session were kept, they have 
disappeared," but this does not prevent him 
from reconstructing the scene, most vividly and 
effectively. Each of the patriots is described 
with minute care — his character, appearance, 
the very clothes he wore ; eloquent speeches are 
put into the mouths of these fathers of the 
Revolution, speeches built up from their re- 
corded utterances on other occasions ; and we 
are even told, with dramatic impressiveness, 
how each speech was received by the little 
audience. " Warming as he developed his 
ideas," says this daring historian, " Warren 
glowed before he was through like a coal from 
the altar ; and the slender company thrilled 
profoundly with that sense of majesty and awful 
earnestness which never failed to make the 
assembly shiver," and so on. Then Adams 
spoke : " We are to be a nation and a great one. 
To be prosperous we must have an extensive 
trade. This will require a respectable navy. 
Our ships must be manned, and the source of 
seamen is the fishery. Nova Scotia and Canada 
would be a great and permanent protection to 
the fishery. And further, the possession of 
these territories would prevent any view of 
Britain to disturb our peace in the future and 
cut off an important source of corrupt British 
influence." From a foot-note we learn that 
" though this letter (the speech in Faneuil HaU 
in 1776 is borrowed — shall we say — from a 
letter of Adams to Cooper, dated April 29th, 
1779) was written later, it seems highly prob- 
able . . . that it represents his views in 1775." 
The italics are the reviewer's. Dr. Smith even 
admits that " a few slight changes have been

requirements of Faneuil HaU. Now all this is 
very entertaining, and altogether calculated to 
stir the heart of the patriotic citizen, — but is 
it history ? 

Again one must say, in justice to Dr. Smith, 
that this highly imaginative style of narrative 
does not mark all the chapters of his book. The 
greater part of the second volume is sane history.

clearly and logically presented. One may not 
always agree with the author's conclusions, but 
one can always respect them as founded upon un- 
questioned documentary evidence. A little more 
reticence in the early chapters might perhaps 
have shorn the book of some of its picturesque- 
ness, but would unquestionably have given it a 
more secure place in the literature of American 
history. 

It remains to note the excellent make-up of 
the book, with its more than three hundred 
admirably-selected illustrations and numerous 
maps, and its exhaustive index — not the least 
of its many good qualities.

Myth and Legend isr Japanese Art.* 



From whatever point of view Japanese works 
of art may be regarded, it is apparent upon even 
slight acquaintance that for full understanding 
some knowledge of their subjects is requisite. 
Not that this is necessary for appreciation of 
their beauty and artistic merit. These qualities, 
it cannot too often be pointed out, have nothing 
to do with the subjects as such, but with the 
treatment. They depend not upon whether the 
artist has chosen to depict one theme rather 
than another, but upon such considerations as 
space arrangement, the placing of the light and 
dark masses, the blending of all the various 
details of composition, drawing, and color, into 
an organic and harmonic whole. But who, after 
having lingered lovingly over a charming net- 
suke or sword guard, or having had his soul 
stirred by the exquisite beauty of a color print 
or of a kakemono painted by a great master, 
does not wish to know something about its sub- 
ject ? And this desire is heightened when it is 
perceived that these works are built upon a 
wide range of poetic conceptions, a world of 
historic and legendary incident, little explored 
as yet by Western students. 

Hitherto the inquirer who has striven to pene- 
trate into this fascinating realm has had to seek 
information in all sorts of out-of-the-way places, 
sometimes having his patience rewarded, but 
more often failing in his quest. For those 
unable to read Japanese books the principal 
treasury upon which they could draw has been 
that vade mecum of every collector for twenty

Episodes, Legendary Characters, Folk-Lore, Myths, Religrious

years past. Dr. William Anderson's " Catalogue 
of the Japanese and Chinese Paintings in the 
British Museum," now long out of print and so 
scarce as to be hardly obtainable. Some store 
of knowledge is yielded by such books as 
Monsieur Bertin's " Les Grandes Guerres 
Civiles du Japon," Huish's " Japan and its 
Art," and the " Catalogue of the Tomkinson 
Collection," but they, too, are scarce, and the 
legendary lore they contain, though consider- 
able, comprises only a small fraction of the 
whole body. 

Very welcome, therefore, is the stout volume 
entitled "Legend in Japanese Art," in which 
Mr. Henri L. Joly has assembled a mass of 
legends, folk-tales, myths, proverbs, descrip- 
tions of religious symbols and of historical and 
fabulous personages and incidents, that far 
transcends anything heretofore available for 
reference. The book is the work of a collector 
who for many years has noted all the information 
he could gather concerning the objects in his 
own collection or those coming under his obser- 
vation. In making the compilation, Japanese 
illustrated books have been freely drawn upon, 
and from them the author has obtained much 
material not previously printed in any European 
language. The restdt is a quarto of more than 
450 pages arranged upon the plan of an ency- 
clopedia, mainly under Japanese name headings, 
and containing over seven hundred half-tone 
illustrations and sixteen full-page process repro- 
ductions of color prints. 

To the collector it is a book that cannot fail 
to prove indispensable. In the main it is 
accurate, the errors being few and of minor 
importance. The erratic spelling of Japanese 
words is, however, greatly to be regretted, since 
the forms used in a work of this kind are 
peculiarly liable to be copied by other writers. 
No definite system of phonetic transliteration 
has been followed. Any pretense to complete- 
ness is frankly disclaimed by the author. There 
are, indeed, some notable omissions, — as for 
instance the story of the mendicant priest 
Seigen, and that of Ushiwaka and the Princess 
Jorurihime, so often utilized by the print de- 
signers. And there is occasional mention of 
things that are left without explanation. More 
than once there is reference to the Ushi toki 
mairi (more properly, Ushi no toki mairi) or 
" envoutement at the hour of the ox," but 
strangely enough no account is given of this 
interesting superstitious rite or incantation not 
infrequently practiced by the Japanese in olden 
times in the hope of casting a spell upon an

enemy or rival. The most serious shortcoming 
is the lack of a full index with ample cross refer- 
ences. The alphabetical arrangement, and the 
long list of emblems and attributes with which 
the book opens, though designed to obviate the 
need for this, accomplish the purpose insuffi- 
ciently, as the reader soon discovers. 

For the student of folk lore the book also 
oifers much of interest. Many of the tales are 
highly entertaining. We read, for example, of 
Genshiki, one of the " Seven Worthies of the 
Bamboo Grove," who could turn the white of 
his eyes to those he hated and the blue to those 
he loved, and who " boated up the Milky Way 
up to the haunts of the Spinning Maiden," 
daughter of the Sun. The sages were indeed a 
marvellous lot of beings. The story of the 
famous journey of Chang K'ien, which is related 
by Mr. Joly, may be quoted here as furnishing 
a curious analogue of that just mentioned. 

" Chang K'ien travelled for seven days and nights up 
the yellow river discovering vine trees, and meeting all 
the animals of Chinese Mythology: the huge tortoises, the 
tiger, seven feet long and a thousand years old, quite 
white, . . . the blue storks, sacred attendants of Seiobo, 
the Kwei or cassia tree of immortality, ten thousand 
feet high, the flaming fruits of which are more powerful 
than the peaches of Seiobo, conferring everlasting life 
to whoever eats them; he saw the hare which lives in 
the moon, and the old man who binds lovers' feet; 
finally on the seventh night he noticed that there were 
no stars reflected in the waters. The following morning, 
near the sources he saw a woman dressed in silver cloth 
on which were embroidered figures of stars, and who 
was weaving the net of the Zodiac. He enquired what 
was her name and what was that place, but she only 
showed him her radiant shuttle, telling him to refer 
the matter to the astrologer on his return. This 
worthy told him that no doubt he had been as far 
as the star Chih Nu, the spinning maiden who, on the 
seventh night of the seventh month is allowed to cross 
over the milky way, to meet her lover, K'ien Niu, pass- 
ing over a bridge of magpies (some others say of red 
maple leaves), and that in fact referring to his observa- 
tions, he had at that very same date noted a shooting 
star passing near Chih Nu. He had therefore travelled 
the whole length of the yellow river as far as the 
Milky way, which continues it into heaven, as decreed 
by Nu Kwa." 

Naturally, in a book composed of many 
detached items some are treated with much 
greater fulness than others. The abundant 
illustrations, chiefly of netsuke, sword guards, 
inro, and ivories, will be highly appreciated by 
all who have occasion to consult this very usefiil 
book, but it is a pity that so many of the colored 
plates should be given over to reproductions of 
unimportant prints by Kuniyoshi when works 
by much greater artists were available.

Signs op Religious Unrest.* 

The historian of the future, discussing civi- 
lized man of the twentieth century, will certainly 
record this period as one of transition. Whether 
we think of matters sociological or psychological, 
whether of the structure of society or the less 
tangible but no less important fabrics of the 
mind, no matter what we hope or wish, we can 
rest assured of one thing — that there will be 
change. To those who love the old and fear 
the new, it often seems as if the end were near. 
Even the ardent radical cannot resist an occa- 
sional sigh of regret, as the old landmarks, so 
familiar and once so well-beloved, slowly dis- 
appear. In religion, it is perhaps true that the 
majority of the old school do not see the advanc- 
ing tide. Religious faiths have always been 
attacked by the enemies of God ; is He not 
still able to defend them? The point over- 
looked is, that the so-caUed enemies are them- 
selves representatives of the Almighty, and have, 
if they tell the truth, the latest advices from 
that quarter. 

That interest inreligion itseK has not departed, 
the vast flood of literature on that topic suffi- 
ciently proves. These books are not written, 
printed, and bound, merely to ornament the 
shelves of booksellers. Readers they must 
have, — eager, numerous, perhaps not over- 
discriminating readers ; for, to tell the truth, 
many of the books are poor things. It is at 
first difficult to imderstand why the religious 
public seem to prefer an infinite variety of 
works of mediocre quality to a few of real 
excellence ; but perhaps it merely indicates a 
variety of tastes, and a desire to view matters 
from several different angles, — and these, so 
far, are good signs. The authorship of the 
works is also significant. In these days of 
commercialism, we expect to see everything 
produced with an eye on the market-place ; but 
it must be said for our religious writers, from 
the wisest to the most absurd, that they are as 
a class obviously altruistic, bent upon flinging 
their message to a needy world. So much good- 
will cannot go for naught. 

Three diverse works, now before us, have 
prompted these remarks. Dr. Crapsey, whose 
point of view is not unknown to the public, 
describes the fall of the dogmatic system and

the re-birth of religion in a freer age, under the 
guidance of the intellect. This is his theology : 
" God is to us the sum of the forces of the universe ; 
to men of old he came now and then, he is with us all 
the time. He is the ceaseless energy from whom all 
things proceed ; he makes the outgoings of the morning 
and evening to praise him; he sorrows over withered 
grass and notes the fall of the sparrow ; he regards the 
complaint of the poor and his eyelids try the children 
of men; to know him is eternal life, and to serve him 
perfect freedom. . . . Man can become man only by 
making himself one with God. And it is m the strength 
of his divinity that the man of the human ideal and the 
man of the social order is to preach his Gospel to all 
peoples and bring all nations into the obedience of the 
Faith." 

In another place we find this : 

" Not only do we have in the new dogmatic the friend 
God of Abraham, and the righteous God of Isaiah, and 
the Father God of Jesus ; but we have also the Infinite 
God of Copernicus and Bruno, the law-making Grod of 
Kepler and Newton, and the working God of Darwin. . . . 
The God of Darwin ... is the God who does things, 
the God who experiments, who is not afraid to soil his 
hands in the clay." 

Various elements of the old dogma, such as those 
of exclusive salvation and of hell, are not merely 
discarded, but are vigorously condemned as 
immoral. The author is as sure of his ground 
as he is earnest and courageous, and we cannot 
otherwise than wish him well ; but at several 
points we find ourselves asking whether we are 
not escaping from one crassness to fall into 
another. The Catholics, with all their faults, 
have a certain justification for their institution 
of the confessional. Our God, if he is truly 
ours, must of necessity stand for something else 
than the noise and flurry of the outside world. 
In a philosophical sense, he may be everywhere ; 
but for practical purposes he comes in through 
a small door in our most private room, and we 
see him alone. 

" The Christ That is to Be " is an attempt to 
formulate the real gospel of Jesus, and to con- 
sider how it may be applied to the modern 
world. The author's sympathies are largely 
with the past, and at the same time his keen 
interest is in developing for the future such 
fruits of the past travail of mankind as may 
prove most useful. He would not break with 
the Church, for that has held the thread of 
Christian thought along the ages ; but he would 
see the Church develop in the spirit of Jesus to 
meet new needs. Perhaps the following pas- 
sage is as eloquent of the writer's attitude as 
anything in the book : 

"We have certainly made progress in knowledge. 
Everyone who believes that good lies at the heart of 
things must believe that this progress is real and, even 
if chequered, will be continuous. At the same time we 



know that at the begiiming and at the end of every 
known sequence of fact or thought lies the unknown. 
DiflPerent epochs produce different theories with regard 
to the borderlands of knowledge; farther off there is 
not even theory to support thought. It is only those 
who lack the power to learn from history who think 
that the tendency of thought for one age, although 
pointing for some time in one direction, necessarily 
points to finahty. Our progress is rather to be observed 
in the ceaseless shifting of opposing races and schools. 
The progress of our knowledge is like an apocalyptic 
' vision; always, everywhere, we have doctrine warring 
against doctrine and theory against theory, men's hearts 
failing them because the very foundations of their 
thought are shaken. In the gloom of each conflict, to 
some God seems gone from heaven; the periodic pulse 
of things, by which order is held out of chaos, beats 
low, and parts of knowledge that seemed as steadfast as 
the stars in the firmament are lost. That which emerges 
out of the din and darkness is the wiser man, not with 
higher powers but with wider opportunity. He knows 
that if he goes backward he fails. He must press for- 
ward; yet, as he goes, something in the creeds that he 
thinks to be dead rises and meets him after many days, 
like a child advancing from the dawn of the morning " 
(pp. 195-196). 

Professer Bousset, of the University of 
Gottingen, has much in common with the writer 
of " The Christ That is to Be." He also would 
test modern Christianity by the teachings of 
Jesus, and would ally himself with the com- 
munities which hold the thread of Christian 
tradition. At the same time, he does not shrink 
from the consequences of modern thought. 
Thus, he says : 

" We no longer hold the belief that Jesus was abso- 
lutely different from ourselves — He heaven-born, we 
earth-born. Rather, we say that His figure is the 
noblest and the most perfect that has been granted to 
humanity on its long journey from the lower stage to 
the higher. He is the goal of our existence, the leader 
of our life, to whom no other leader is comparable "

earnest doctor anything like pride of authorship is 
a mere superfluity of vanity. " The problem of 
lives exalted, or sunk, or messed away, knocks at 
his heart. Let other young men write lurid little 
books, and tear the veil from the obvious, and be 
proud of that achievement : what are they to him, 
who entertains daily, as a matter of course, both 
Hell and Heaven ? " In reading these richly sug- 
gestive essays on " Vocation," " Hospital Life," 
"The Discipline of Practice," "The Spirit of 
Practice," " Retirement," etc., one is again incident- ' 
ally reminded of the great and increasing vogue, 
among those of psychological or philosophical bent, 
of that former professor of psychology and present 
teacher of pragmatism. Dr. William James. The 
author of " Confessio Medici " is evidently one of 
his most appreciative readers : he calls him " the 
wisest of her [i.e. psychology's] servants," and likens 
him to Socrates for simplicity of style. One piece 
of excellent advice that the essayist gives to young 
practitioners is a little hard to follow : he urges them 
to add to their professional equipment, at the out- 
set, a serious illness or surgical operation, or both, 
that they may the more sympathetically treat their 
future patients. One cannot at will develop a 
malignant tumor or other life-threatening excres- 
cence ; but how would it do for every medical 
student, just before getting his diploma, to go to the 
hospital and be de-appendicized ? The operation is 
now fairly safe, and the vermiform appendix would 
certainly never be missed. Every page of the book, 
let us say in conclusion, is good reading, whether 
the reader be doctor or patient, or neither. The 
writer's style wiU delight the connoisseur. We can- 
not refrain from giving a random illustrative frag- 
ment out of the essay on "Hospital Life." The 
London hospitals, declares the author, "ought to 
work together, abandon competition, break their 
distinctive idols, throw open their sacred groves, 
and pool their patients. That would be a new ver- 
sion of the story of Bethesda : and the waters of 
that pool would indeed be troubled."

who have unravelled the secrets of the habits and 
life-histories of those insects which have become

all the offenders of this ilk, none has more to account 
for than the ubiquitous mosquito. His name, more- 
over, is legion ; or, in more exact phrase, there are 
nearly a hundred known species in the United 
States which Miss Evelyn Groesbeeck Mitchell re- 
cords in her treatise on " Mosquito Life" (Putnam). 
This author's book is based upon the extensive 
observations of the late Dr. J. W. Dupree, the 
physician-natm'alist of New Orleans. Miss Mitchell 
was engaged as artist-entomologist in making the 
illustrations for a work upon this subject which 
Dr. Dupree had in preparation at the time of his 
death. She has completed the work, and included 



in it some of her own later studies made while com- 
pleting a monograph on the group for the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington. The book is replete with 
information concerning the mosquitoes of the United 
States, especially those of New York, New Jersey, 
and Louisiana. The anatomy of the adults, larvae, 
and pupae is described, and an illuminating account 
of their habits, flight, and breeding-places is given 
in detail. The relation of mosquitoes to malaria, 
yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases, is 
treated in a popular way, and a description of the 
means of control of these pests is supplemented with 
an account of their principal enemies. The most 
original material in the book is to be found in the 
notes on the common species of this country, which 
constitute a considerable portion of the book, and 
are amply illustrated. There is an excellent chapter 
on laboratory methods, which will be useful to 
teachers of nature-study classes ; while the keys for 
the identification of adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae 
will be of service to all who study mosquitoes. The 
drawings would have been more useful if magnifica- 
tions had been given, and more acceptable from a 
technical point of view if more contrast had been 
employed, and if the direction of lighting had been 
consistently used, at least in contiguous drawings.

account of his life and personality. They strolled 
through the Lake Country and collected a large 
amount of anecdotes and traditions from those who 
remembered him, especially from his neighbors 
among the yeomen and peasants. To them Words- 
worth had seemed a queer, uncanny, half-daft old 
man, who went muttering and " booing " about the 
country, reciting and composing verses that to them 
were naturally imintelligible. A prosaic world, 
being ever ready to depreciate what it does not 
comprehend, accepted the rustic estimate, and 
created an image of a solitary, self-absorbed, rather 
repellant personality, with affections so dormant as 
to be scarcely human. Even those who loved 
Wordsworth's verse felt some need to apologize for 
his unloveliness as a man. In the present genera- 
tion, however, a truer and saner way of reconstruct- 
ing Wordsworth's personality has been adopted. 
Instead of inquiring of persons who knew only his 
exterior, who were incapable of understanding his 
real nature, his later biographers have searched 
among family letters and the records of his more 
cultured acquaintances and friends for contemporary 
evidence of that " best portion of a good man's life, 
his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness 
and of love." Now, at last, we realize that 
Wordsworth was a man of a warm and affectionate 
heart, the cordial host of an uncommonly hospitable 
home, the acknowledged centre of a devoted circle 
of friends, a gracious personality of whom we can 
scarcely hear too much. One of the latest and best 
of this class of biographers is Mr. David Watson

Bannie, the author of "Wordsworth and his

includes not only near neighbors of Wordsworth, 
like Southey and Samuel Clarkson, but a long list 
of others like De Quincey, Scott, Coleridge, and 
Lamb, who for longer or shorter periods came to the

ality as well as of his poetry. Not the least original 
and brilliant chapter of this book is the one devoted 
to Wordsworth's " Fellow- Workers in Romanticism " 
— Byron, Keats, and especially Shelley. The author 
takes " Alastor " and the " Hymn to Intellectual

much the same way. Yet fancy the consternation

The latest 
word in 
Botany. 



Dr. C. C. Curtis, of Columbia Uni- 
versity, presents a pleasant summary 
of modern botany, in his volume 
entitled "The Nature and Development of Plants" 
(Holt). For once, we have a book about science 
and scientific research which is withal not a text- 
book, has no reference to laboratory or class-room, 
but is simply a book to be read or consulted as occa- 
sion or inclination may suggest. While the story is, 
of course, in its broader outlines old and to some ex- 
tent familiar, nevertheless we have on almost every 
page sentences that represent the latest phases of 
theory and research. The first section of the vol- 
ume dealing with the nature of plants is in this 
regard especially to be commended. The author, 
meanwhile avoiding the more technical sides of his 
subject, carries his argument forward in a style so 
clear and simple that the most inexperienced reader 
may easily foUow the fascinating story. In these 
restless days, nearly every book of science is old 
almost before it leaves the binder. Possibly antici- 
pating such a possibility, our author presents some 
conclusions which present knowledge does not en- 
tirely justify. For instance, few botanists would 
be inclined to rank transpiration as a leaf-function 
comparable to photosynthesis. Again, while bacteria 
are no doubt causally related to several forms of 
infectious disease, it is by no means equally certain 
that certain other diseases, specifically small-pox and 
hydrophobia, " are due to a low order of microscopic 
animal life." The organism to be associated with 
small-pox is yet to be discovered. The volume is 
handsomely printed, and abounds in carefully-drawn 
and in most cases original illustrations. 



-^dam Smith A. new and illuminating view-point 
of modern gives value to Professor Albion W. 

-ociologv. Small's treatise on " Adam Smith and 

Modern Sociology" (University of Chicago Press). 
To those who have been accustomed to regard 
" The Wealth of Nations " as a brilliant if somewhat 
provincial study in pure economics, or, on account 



of its "labor-cost theory," as a possible point of 
departure for Marxian socialism, it will be a mental 
leap to Professor Small's contention that the famous 
work should be studied only in its correlation to 
sociology. Adam Smith's "Theory of Moral Sen- 
timents," says Professor Small, is an attempt to state 
life in large moral terms, from which " The Wealth 
of Nations " is merely a technological excursus. It 
is a treatise entirely responsible to a moral philos- 
ophy which takes into account all human activities. 
Adam Smith, however, in spite of his admirable 
concreteness, inconsistently used in his reasoning 
both the inductive and deductive methods ; and occa- 
sionally his conclusions were obscured. The result 
was that his successors fell from his high level of 
thought, where his broad vision comprehended the 
relation between economic and sociological thinking, 
and economics developed as a science of things 
independent of human relations. To repair this 
divergence, as he believes it to be, Professor Small 
presents his study in "Sociological Methodology," 
and analyzes in some detail "The Wealth of Nations," 
showing where its author is strictly technological and 
where he touches upon " the larger science of soci- 
ology." With this new light turned on the subject, 
old students of Adam Smith will find fresh food for 
reflection, and those unacquainted with the great 
scholar will be fortunate in approaching him through 
Professor Small's scholarly and philosophical intro- 
duction. 

A Bishop of Richard Hooker Wilmer, Second 
t?ie Southern Bishop of Alabama, occupied a 
Confederacy. unique position in the American 
Episcopate. He was the only Bishop consecrated 
in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confed- 
erate States of America, which in the years 1861-5 
maintained an organization separate and distinct 
from the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United 
States. Having followed the fortunes of the Southern 
Confederacy, he and his clergy were, at the close of 
the Civil War, under General Orders No. 38, for- 
bidden by the Federal military authority to preach 
or perform divine service until they should " give 
evidence of a patriotic spirit, by offering to resume 
the use of the prayer for the President of the United 
States and all in civil authority." So he was "the 
man upon whom, in the providence of God, it de- 
volved to make the fight in these United States for 
the independence and supremacy of the Church in 
things spiritual." Hence the life of this man, which 
closed Jime 14, 1900, in the eighty-fifth year of his 
age, is of far wider than diocesan interest. It is a 
contribution to the history of the Church and of the 
country. The Bishop will perhaps be best remem- 
bered, among those who knew him, for his quickness 
at repartee and his incisive humor — his " naturally 
destructive wit," which, happily, he held under 
restraint, and bent " not to self-pleasing, but to the 
advancement of the cause of Christ." These quali- 
ties should serve to make his biography unusually 
readable. Fortunately, the Reverend Walter C.

Clyde : River and Firth " (Macmillan) is at once a 
beautiful and a readable volume. Mr. Munro pro- 
tests strongly against the popular misconception of 
the great Scottish river, which ignores all its claims 
to romantic beauty and regards it as a mere " drudge 
of commerce," — the " scullery maid of Glasgow." 
The Clyde, he explains, is like the Thames in being 
not one river but three, — mountain stream, turgid 
river of commerce, and splendid island-dotted firth. 
It is manifestly unfair to disregard everything but 
the " prosaic and squalid interlude " of mile-long 
docks and vast ship-yards, where all the navies of 
the world come and go. Even this part of the 
Clyde is not without charm for Mr. Munro, though 
he admits that the time to see it is at night. But 
above Glasgow anyone must acknowledge the love- 
liness of the Lowland scenery ; and the grandeur of 
the Firth of Clyde is also beyond dispute. Like 
all the rest of Scotland, Clydesdale is rich in legend 
and ballad-lore, much of which Mr. Munro weaves 
into his narrative. He is also enthusiastic over the 
fishing afforded by the upper river-reaches and the 
yachting on the Firth, and is not above indicating 
the sea-side villages with special attractions for the 
summer " tripper." There are also special chapters 
on Glasgow, Lennox, and Greenock. The artists, 
on the other hand, keep rather strictly to the river 
and the firth, showing them, however, in many phases 
of beauty and picturesque grandeur. Between pic- 
tures and text we are fully convinced that Mr. 
Munro is not far wrong in calling the Clyde " the 
most astonishing, beautiful, and inspiring of Scottish 

water-ways." 

Charming A. group of nearly a score of essays, 

ZTnoiish l>y ^^' John J. Ward, published 

naturalist. originally in English periodicals, has 

been reprinted, with revised letter-press and addi- 
tional illustrations, under the title " Some Nature 
Biographies" (Lane). Although they deal with the 
observations and experiments of a naturalist in 
English woods and fields, they are of interest to 
American readers, not only because of the pains- 
tJiking care with which the author has gathered his 
facts and his illustrations, and the pleasing manner 
in which he has related them, but also because of the 
fact that some of the chapters — for example, that 
on the life-study of the jelly-fish, the ones recording 
the revelations which the microscope makes of 



opening buds and falling leaves and the interesting 
shells of the lowest forms of life, and the story of a 
piece of coal — have no limitations of locality to 
circumscribe their interest. Even the beautifully 
illustrated chapter giving the life-histories of various 
English butterflies, in word and picture, from the 
egg to the adult, is not without value to those who 
wish to follow in like sequence the history of our 
American insects. The illustrations are in the main 
of unusual excellence. The book closes with twelve 
finely executed half-tones showing the wax and wane 
of the seasons in a typical English landscape. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A little book of " Selections from Chaucer," edited by 
Dr. Edwin A. Greenlaw, is included in the "Lake 
English Classics" of Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. 
We are given the Prologue, four Tales, and a group of 
lyrics. There are also notes, glossary, and introduction. 
The book is very well put together for its educational 
purpose. 

« A Himdred Great Poems," selected by Mr. Richard 
James Cross, make up a neat little book published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It would be rash to call these 
the " greatest " English poems, and some of them are 
not " great " in any sense, but they are all good poetry, 
and that is as much as the purchaser of any book with 
such a title has a right to expect. 

" Heroines That Every Child Should Know " is a new 
volume in the series that already includes many other 
sorts of things that children should know (but generally 
do not), published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
It is prepared imder the co-editorial supervision of Mr. 
H. W. Mabie and Miss Kate Stephens. The heroines 
range all the way from Alcestis to Florence Nightingale. 

"Hie sonnets of Longfellow are presented by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in a graceful little volume that 
every lover of the poet will wish to possess. Mr. Ferris 
Greenslet is responsible for the arrangement and the 
introduction. Besides the regular edition, two hundred 
and seventy-five copies have been printed on handmade 
paper, in the interests of the collector and those who 
may care to give the volume a permanent binding for 
the library. 

"Minor Poems of Michael Drayton," chosen and 
edited by Mr. Cyril Brett, and " Shakespeare's Sonnets 
and A Lover's Complaint," with introduction by Mr. 
W. H. Hadow, are two new volumes in the "Tudor 
and Stuart Library," issued by Mr. Henry Frowde. 
Accurately reproducing, as they do, the original texts, 
the volumes of this series are almost indispensable to 
the literary scholar; while the lover of fine bookmaking 
cannot but delight in their beautiful external form. 

Under the editorship of Mr. Daniel O'Connor, a 
series of " Classiques Fran^ais Illustr^s " has been 
inaugurated by Messrs. Bell & Sons (New York: Mac- 
millan). The first volume, containing George Sand's 
" Les Maitres Sonneurs," is provided with a preface by 
M. d'Emile Faquet and numerous illustrations (both 
in color and black-and-white) by M. V. Wheelhouse. 
The series should make a strong appeal to those who 
like their French texts in worthier and more substantial 
form than the usual Paris editions.

Notes. 



Miss Elisabeth McClellan, author of " Historic Dress 
in America" (1607-1800), is now engaged upon a 
second volume to be issued under the same title, which 
will cover the period from 1800 to the present time. 

A special souvenir edition of Maeterlinck's " Pelleas 
and Melisande " is in preparation by Thomas Y. Crowell 
& Co. The book will be profusely illustrated with 
scenes from Debussy's opera, and will contain a critical 
introduction by Mr. Montrose J. Moses. 

" The Comments of Bagshot," by Mr. J. A. Spender, 
editor of the " Westminster Gazette," will be published 
in this coimtry by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. " Bag- 
shot " is an amiable recluse in the English Civil Service 
who comments genially on pretty nearly everything 
from riches and socialism to death and immortality. 

« The Tempest " and " As You Like It " are two vol- 
umes in the " Lamb Shakespeare for the Young," which 
is a special section of the general " Shakespeare Library " 
now appearing under the American imprint of Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. Lamb's prose, with bits of real Shake- 
speare interspersed, is the plan of these charming little 
books. 

The early publication of M. Gabriel Compayre's 
volume on Montaigne, by Messrs. Crowell & Co., will 
complete a series of notable volumes on pedagogy by 
this famous French educator. The series is known as 
" Pioneers in Education," and includes volumes on 
J. J. Rousseau, Herbert Spencer, Pestalozzi, Herbart, 
and Horace Mann. 

" Popular Participation in Law Making," by Judge 
Charles Sumner Lobingier, lately of the Nebraska 
Supreme Court, and now United States Judge in the 
Philippines, is announced by The Macmillan Co. In 
this book Judge Lobingier traces the growth of the 
popular demand for opportunity to act directly in civic 
affairs without intervention of delegates or middlemen. 

Two German texts published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. are the following: "Das Fraulein von Scuderi," 
by E. T. A. Hoffmann, edited by Professor Gustav 
Gruener; and " Die beiden Freunde," a tale by Count 
Heknuth von Moltke, edited by Dr. Karl Detlev Jessen. 
From Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we have Riehl's 
"Burg Neidek," edited by Professor J. B, E. Jones; 
and Heine's " Die Harzreise," edited by Professor 
B. J. Vos. 

The " Turk's Head Edition " of Oliver Goldsmith's 
works, which Messrs. Putnam's Sons will publish this 
Spring in ten octavo volumes, will present Goldsmith 
in complete and trustworthy text, based upon Peter 
Cimningham's edition. Mr. Horatio Sheafe Krans has 
provided a biographical and critical introduction, and 
there will be eighty full-page illustrations in photo- 
g^vure from original designs by Mr. Frederick Simpson 
Cobum. 

Almost simultaneously with the publication of the 
English version of Carl Ewald's novel, " The Old Room," 
comes the news of the death of the distinguished Danish 
author. Ewald is best known to American readers by 
" Two Legs," one of a long series of whimsical fairy- 
tales, and " My Little Boy," a perfect idyl of childhood, 
full of subtle psychology and mystical charm. In his 
own land Ewald's work has long been thoroughly appre- 
ciated, and it is well known in other countries of Europe, 
America having been rather behind hand in recognizing 
his delightful originality. 



During the present year Messrs. Scribner's Sons will 
publish a new single-volume " Dictionary of the Bible," 
edited by Dr. James Hastings, whose five-volume dic- 
tionary is recogfnized as the leading work of its kind. 
Every article has been specially written for this work, 
which is not in any sense an abridgement of the larger 
one. The authors have been chosen with as much 
care as the authors of the large dictionary, and with 
more experience ; so that the average of scholarship will 
be, if anything, higher. 

Of foremost interest among the latest issues in Mr. 
Henry Frowde's excellent series of " World's Classics " 
is the volume of Cowper's letters, to which Mr. E. V. 
Lucas contributes a pleasant introduction. Mr. Lucas 
also edits Jane Austen's " Emma " ; and Mr. Austin 
Dobson performs a similar office for Reynolds's " Dis- 
courses." Besides these, there are the fifth and sixth 
volume of Edmund Burke's writings, completing the set ; 
and the second volume of Browning's poems. 

The first volume of the new edition of the " Dictionary 
of National Biography " has just been published simul- 
taneously in England and America (The Macmillan Co. 
being the American publishers), and it is promised that 
a new volume will appear each month until the twenty- 
two volumes are out. The original edition was in sixty- 
six volumes, and was pubUshed at more than three times 
the price of the present edition. Furthermore, the new 
edition has been corrected and some of the bibliographies 
have been revised, so that it is really preferable, both 
on account of accuracy and the amount of shelf-room 
required, to the original issue. 

Two books announced for early spring publication by 
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. should be of especial 
importance to the student of archaeology and to the 
general reader interested in this subject. One is entitled 
" Archaeology and False Antiquities," and recounts some 
of the attempts made to palm off forged antiquities upon 
the unsuspecting relic hunter. The second book, " Celtic 
Art in Pagan and Christian Times," deals with the vari- 
ous manifestations of the art of the Celt, as revealed 
in architectural construction and applied design, before 
the Anglo-Saxon set foot on British soil. 

"The Bibliophile" is the title of a new monthly 
" magazine and review for the collector, .student, and 
general reader " just projected in London. A strong 
array of contributors is presented in the first number, 
including Mr. G. K. Chesterton, Mrs. Arthur Bell, and 
Dr. A. W. Pollard; and there are numerous illustra- 
tions, including several in color. It is a pity that this 
first number should be marred throughout by wretched 
proof-reading; as the class to which the magazine makes 
its especial appeal is, or should be, the most exacting 
on such points. But notvvnthstanding this defect, " The 
Bibliophile " should have a cordial welcome from every 
book-collector. 

Edmondo de Amicis, who died last month at Bardig- 
hera in Italy, was one of the most widely read among 
Italian authors, both in and out of his own coimtry. 
His education was military, and his first book, published 
in 1869, before he had retired from active service, was 
a volume of short stories of army life. The instant 
success achieved by these sketches seemed to warrant 
the gratification of the young author's taste for litera- 
ture and for travel. He journeyed to many lands and 
recorded his impressions so charmingly, — with the 
same delicate understanding and quick sympathy that 
had distinguished his first effort, — that his travel

sketches speedily became text-books in many different 
languages. Half a dozen stories, also, followed his 
first, and were very popular. His later years have been 
given over to the study of educational and economic 
questions, and his recent works indicate a decided lean- 
ing towards socialism. 

The only Spring publication from Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.'s department of Riverside Press Editions 
will be a " Bibliography of Ralph Waldo Emerson," by 
Mr. George WiUis Cooke. The Press now has in hand 
two large undertakings: an augmented English edition 
of Bernard's Life of the great Renaissance designer and 
printer, Greofroy Tory, elaborately and profusely illus- 
trated; and a sumptuous folio edition of Dante's " Divina 
Commedia," to contain both the complete Italian text 
and Professor Charles Eliot Norton's prose translation, 
and to be embellished with drawings from the rare 
designs of Botticelli. The " Geofroy Tory " will be 
published in the Autumn of 1908, and one or two other 
small books of interest may be expected about the same 
time. It is hoped that the Dante will be ready for pub- 
lication in 1910. 

Announcement of what Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. characterize as their most important publication in 
several years has just been made. This is a large-paper 
edition, in twenty-five volumes, of the complete writings 
of George EUot, prepared upon a new plan with many 
unique features. " The underlying principle is that the 
reader's enjoyment will be increased a hundredfold if 
he knows the author intimately. The edition therefore 
will be fully equipped with the material necessary to 
such an acquaintance. All of the author's earlier books 
were based to a large extent upon real scenes and char- 
acters, but the facts have not been generally known. 
By sending a special representative to visit these scenes 
and make personal investigations, a large amount of new 
and interesting information has been obtained, resulting 
in a collection of photographs of the scenes that were 
in the author's mind when she wrote these novels. It 
was learned that many of the characters were taken 
from life, and portraits of many of these persons were 
obtained All these photographs are made valuable to 
the reader by a series of explanatory notes on the illus- 
trations. The edition will contain the best collection of 
portraits of George Eliot ever brought together. There 
will be also two interesting portraits of Mr. Lewes, and 
photographs of the birthplace of George Eliot, Griff 
House where she spent her girlhood, the various schools 
which she attended, and the different homes of her later 
life. In the volumes where the author does not write 
of real scenes the illustrations are by distinguished 
English artists, including Mr. Charles E. Brock, Mr. 
Fred Pegram, Mr. H. M. Paget, Mr. A. S. Hartrick, and 
Mr. Ambrose Dudley, besides reproductions of some 
charming water-colors by Mrs. Patty Townsend Johnson, 
who was living in the George Eliot country at the time 
the novels first appeared. Introductions have been 
prepared for all the different novels setting forth in 
detail the circumstances under which they were written 
and all the information which the reader should have to 
appreciate fully their purpose. Mr. Cross's biography, 
made up very largely from the author's own journals 
and letters, will be included to give the reader a still 
more intimate acquaintance. One entire volume of the 
edition will be devoted to material written by George 
Eliot but never before published in a collected edition. 
The text will be printed from plates especially made for 
this edition from entirely new type."

The Life and Letters of George Bancroft 

By M. A. DE WOLFE HOWE. lUus. 2 vols., 4.00 net; postpaid $4.30. 

One of the most important books of biography and history of recent years. The long life of George 
Bancroft (1800-1891) almost covered the nineteenth century; and during the greater part of it, as scholar, 
historian, statesman, and diplomatist, he had a wider personal acquaintance with the great figures among 
his contemporaries than perhaps any other American. But this is not only the life and career of one of 
the most distinguished Americans, but in a remarkable degree a picture of the political and social changes 
and events of nearly two-thirds of the last century. 

SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF THE VOLUMES 



Student Life at Gbttingen, 1818-1820. 

The Ceremony of Taking the Doctor's Degree.

Guizot, Lamartine, Benjamin Constant, and 

Louis Philippe.

Intimate Friendship with von Moltke, Bismarck, 

and the Emperor William. 



PASSING PROTESTANTISM AND COMING CATHOLICISM ^%''i^oT„et'?po'Jtp™',?.fo

the needs of the day and of the hopes for a united Christian church.

EXAGGERATION AND THE ARTISTIC 
[ TEMP ERAM ENT. 

The century is young; the world also is young, 
as worlds go ; and our country, compared with many, 
is very young. Exaggeration is one of the faults 
to which youth is peculiarly subject — and from 
which age is not wholly free. 

To be an artist — in words, in color, with the 
chisel, on the stage, or in whatever medium — and 
not to exaggerate, sometimes and to some extent, 
might fairly be considered an impossibility. With 
the example of the Supreme Artist (personified or 
not) constantly before one's eyes, how could it be 
otherwise? For who will claim that the universe 
exhibits an exact adaptation of means to ends, with 
no waste? What an infinitesimal fraction of the 
sun's energy serves any known or conceivable end, 
compared with the vast amount of heat radiated 
each second into infinite space ! Why should the 
maple tree produce ten thousand seeds a year when 
one seed in ten years would more than perpetuate 
its kind ? Of course the naturalist's explanation is 
obvious enough ; but the truth remains that nature 
is the very type and example of exaggeration, of a 
lavish exuberance that is the very opposite of restraint 
and reserve. In a sort of frolic superabimdance of 
vital energy not even the superlatives of the up-to- 
date journalist can vie with her. 

But this is not saying that hyperbole is a good 
thing in itself, or that the easy art of exaggeration 
is one to be cultivated. Rather is exaggeration to 
be regarded as an evil, though a necessary one, and 
its restraint to be studied. It is one form of ani- 
mation, and animated restraint, as Walter Bagehot 
long ago observed, is a most desirable quality in 
literary expression, as in art generally. What makes 
the judicious exaggerator grieve is the reckless 
waste with which his carefully husbanded reserves 
of strong and effective words and phrases are 
squandered by the unthinking and unscrupulous on 
subjects of trivial moment ; so that when the really 
great occurrence demands forceful description, the 
adequately descriptive terms are found to have been 
all worn threadbare. Funds that should have been 
accumulating against an earthquake, a pestilence, or 
a war, have been dribbling away in the purchase of 
daily bread. The reckless exaggerator is a spend- 
thrift ; unthinking resort to hyperbole is improvi- 
dence ; and the few wise and heedful pay for the 
misdoings of the many foolish. 

Arecent book on "The Fortunes of the Republic," 
by a writer whose occupancy of a pulpit famous in 
our church history gives his utterances a weight and 
authority they might not otherwise possess, contains

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



this sentence in its preface : " I have talked with 
thousands of men of all classes, and if one can trust 
one's own eyes and ears, there is not the shadow of 
a shade of a reason for pessimism as to the people 
and institutions of this country." Taken literally, 
" thousands " means at least two thousand, and " all 
classes " admits of no exceptions. Each conversa- 
tion, too, if profitable for instruction, must have 
occupied at least ten minutes. But who will believe 
that this busy preacher and pastor, writer and lec- 
turer, has spent three or four hundred hours dis- 
cussing industrial and sociological questions with 
representatives of all classes, from the philanthropist 
to the pick-pocket, from the plutocrat to the pauper, 
and from the organizer of vast industries to the 
vender of peanuts ; and that not one of them all 
had any serious complaints or gloomy forebodings 
with which to cloud the author's optimistic outlook ? 
And if the reader's credulity is thus strained at the 
very start, what likelihood that the succeeding 
chapters of the book will carry conviction ? Surely 
the literary artist has here laid on his colors much 
too thickly. 

The phrase " as easy as lying " is no bad formula 
to indicate the extreme of facility. The tempta- 
tion to let a story lose nothing in the telling, but 
rather gain a great deal, is almost irresistible. It 
has been plausibly conjectured that the artistic 
temperament, the love of effective statement, in 
Carlyle and his wife, was responsible for all the 
wild rumors of acute inharmony between that inter- 
esting couple. Turning the pages of Mrs. Carlyle's 
sprightly correspondence, without looking for pas- 
sages of conjugal endearment or the opposite, one 
soon chances on such highly-colored bits as the 
following vehement reference to a not very extrar 
ordinary incident connected with her pet dog Nero : 
" As for Nero, his temper is at all times that of an 
angel. But yesterday, O heavens ! I made my first 
experience of the strange, suddenly-struck-solitary, 
altogether-ruined feeling of having lost one's dog ! 
and also of the phrensied feeling of recognising him, 
from a distance, in the arms of a dog-stealer ! But 
mercifully it was near home that he was twitched up." 
And apropos of repairs going on in the house, she 
writes distressfully to her absent husband : " For 
God^s sake do not let John plump in upon me in 
my present puddlement. There wants only him, or 
the like of him, constantly running out and in, inter- 
fering with everything and needing to be attended 
to, to make my discomfort complete. The bare idea 
of it makes me like to scream ! " With Carlyle him- 
self, in his unstinted use of picturesquely emphatic 
language, readers are familiar. Writing to his 
brother John, he calls Ruskin, with humorous ex- 
aggeration of the latter's qualities, " a bottle of 
beautiful soda-water," and Macaulay he unduly 
depreciates in styling him, although " a man of truly 
wonderful historical memory," yet " in other respects 
constantly definable as the sublime of commonplace, 
not one of whose ideas has the least tincture of great- 
ness or originality or any kind of superior merit 



except neatness of expression ; valde mediocris 
homo." But it is in picturing his own woes and 
grievances that the artist's delight in vivid expres- 
sion rises to its height in Carlyle. It is a question 
which gave him the greater satisfaction, toiling stren- 
uously and successfully at his " Friedrich " for eight 
busy years, or groaning and ejaculating, in forcible 
exclamations and adjectives and adverbs, over his 
herculean task. "Ever since I wrote last year 
from Scotsbrig," he tells his brother John as the 
great book nears completion, " I have been working 
like a slave ; day and night involved in confusions, 
of the most unmanageable nature ; — the only limit 
not to break myself down altogether, in which case 
there would be no hope of the job. Never in my 
life had I a thing so difficult to do ; and I am fallen 
old, and feckless in comparison ; hope much dead 
in me ; not fit to handle such huge mountains of 
rubbish ; — yet dreadfully unwilling to be beaten by 
them, too. Being withal in the most evident state 
of special Hi-health, worse than even naturally belongs 
to me at this age." A permissible comment on this 
artistry in words would be that the artist himself, 
with all his dyspeptic grumblings and growlings,. 
outlived his younger brothers and passed far beyond 
the three-score-and-seven years alloted to average 
mortality. 

Artistic emphasis of certain aspects or details is 
necessary in graphic art to differentiate it from the 
monotonous literalness of photography. The same 
judicious placing of emphasis is demanded in writ- 
ing, in order to convert dull and colorless narrative 
into literature. What is characteristic requires 
touching up, what is unessential must be properly 
toned down. In the things of every-day life, in 
matters of conduct and costume and personal appear- 
ance, it is a process instinctive even in the least 
aesthetically developed of the race. The thick- 
lipped South-African negro is prone to exaggerate 
this labial deformity (or beauty, as he regards it) 
by thrusting thorns through his lips to make them 
swell ; arid, already provided with an abundant crop 
of woolly hair, he masses it high on the top of his 
head to accentuate the effect. Many tribes, as the 
Malays, the Kirghis, and the Hottentots, depress 
the already flat nose, sometimes even breaking down 
the bone ; whereas the thin-nosed Arab or Spaniard 
can never acquire too great aquilinity. American 
Indians, unblessed with beards, pull out the few 
chin hairs they may chance to have ; and hirsute 
Aino women paint the upper lip to make the mus- 
tache look heavier. The oblique eyes of Japanese 
belles are artificially made to appear even more 
oblique; and the long, narrow eyes of Egyptian 
dames are likewise rendered longer and narrower 
in appearance than in reality. The fat women of 
Uganda assiduously cultivate obesity, and the lean 
ladies of Java eat clay to reduce themselves still 
further. Chinese women, having naturally small 
feet, pinch them to infantile proportions. And so 
on, to any length. 

Exaggeration, then, for purposes of aesthetic effect^ 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

is inevitable, and, within limits, desirable. It is the 
due observance of the limits, the attainment of that 
golden mean which is artistic emphasis and not vulgar 
extravagance, that marks the true artist, economical 
of his resources and never conveying the impression 
of having exhausted his reserve force. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The problem of the publishers, which iu the end 
is the problem of all dealers in merchantable wares — 
namely, how to sell their products so as to bring in the 
largest returns — is discussed by Mr. Merton H. Forrester 
in the current " Munsey's Magazine." The article is 
headed, " What has Happened to the American Book- 
Publishers ? " And the answer given is that they have 
failed to take the hint furnished by the conspicuous suc- 
cess of the ten-cent magazines. It is argued that if 
attractive and low-priced periodical literature attains 
so wide a circulation as it has in the last dozen years, 
the same circulation ought to be attainable by attractive 
and low-priced books. It is further pointed out that, 
to use the writer's words, " no one has yet done more 
than scratch the surface of the possible reading public," 
and that even a book that has a sale of six hundred thou- 
sand copies is bought by only three-tenths of one per 
cent of the population of the United States. The argu- 
ment, as presented, is plausible ; but no account is taken 
of the fact that magazines live by their advertisements. 
Is there room in the advertising field, already so largely 
covered by the magazines and newspapers — not to men- 
tion the bill-boards, the street cars, the sandwich men, 
and various other means of attaining publicity — for 
books too ? We have groaned, but groaned patiently, 
imder the weight of the magazine's advertising pages. 
Should we ever submit to a proportionate increase in the 
size and weight of our books ? The English experiment 
in half-crown novels has yet to be proved a success. The 
vast circulation of the so-called " subterranean " liter- 
ature, the sensational trash that the world of letters 
knows nothing about, is not mentioned by Mr. Forrester, 
and hardly bears on the question under discussion, except 
to make a self-respecting author shudder at the thought 
of his poem or novel or essay depending, for its com- 
mercial success, on any such " cheap and nasty " style 
and methods. Perhaps Mr. Seymour Eaton and his 
lately organized Thinkers' Club will think out the cor- 
rect solution of this problem of the pubUshers. 
• ■ • 

Mr. Carnegie's additional gift of five million 
dollars to the resources of the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching is to the educational world 
a matter of large importance. It assures the participation 
in the Foimdation upon equal terms of State Universities 
and the Universities of private foundation. The tenta- 
tive exclusion of the State Universities called forth no 
uncertain protest from those affiliated alike with private 
and state-supported institutions. The danger that Uni- 
versities were to be classed according to the source of 
their funds and not according to the ideals that deter- 
mined the manner of their expenditure was a very real 
one. Equally real was the danger that the two types 
of institution would be drawn into a rivalry spoken of 
as friendly in public conclave but hardly leading to 



friendly relations in the educational confessional. More- 
over, the fact that the division line between the two 
types of institution was partly geographical still further 
presented the possibilities of factional and sectional divi- 
sion; while overshadowing these objections stood the 
fundamental disability that the Foundation, the integrity 
of whose service depended upon its achieving a national 
status and influence, was thus likely to be a one-sided 
and limited influence. It was pretty broadly hinted that 
the Trustees, — all chosen from private institutions, — 
while presenting arguments to show the necessity of the 
Umitation of the Foundation, were really acting upon 
the conviction that presently the fimds would not be 
sufficient to " go round." To have the financial dis- 
ability completely removed certainly opens the way for 
a graceful retreat. It is in every way a consummation 
devoutly wished and devoutly welcomed. In The Dial 
of May 16, 1905, the great educational importance 
of the institution which Mr. Carnegie has called into 
being has been duly set forth. It seems eminently 
desirable that additional influences should be set at 
work to dignify and secure the academic career in the 
land of the dollar; and it is gratifying to record that 
dollars are to be used to bring some measure of security 
to the teaching profession in the higher institutions of 
learning throughout the length and breadth of the land. 
The State is ever an uncertain compensator for services 
rendered; and the argument of paternalism distresses 
legislatures. The inclusion of professors in state- 
supported institutions in this truly national foundation 
is only just, but of that type of justice more frequently 
conceded on paper than provided for in practice. Hence 
this tribute to Mr. Carnegie and the Trustees of the 
Foundation. ... 

The old and the new in librarianship have 
their respective claims to consideration, and the writer 
who has been discussing with Mr. Briggs, our recent cor- 
respondent, the merits of the ancient system, and who 
fears that some of his own remarks have been mis- 
understood or have even caused pain, ventures to add 
a few explanatory and propitiatory comments. He says : 
" There is really no cause for any disagreement between 
Mr. Briggs and the present writer. The desirability of 
wider acquaintance with books on the part of librarians 
great and small is one of the leading points of the 
doctrine preached here from week to week. In admi- 
ration for the spirit of book-lover and book-knower 
which was a characteristic of the ' old-fashioned libra- 
rian,' we will not yield a jot to anyone. If necessary, 
chapter and verse can be quoted to show that that creed 
has always been upheld in this pulpit. The little piece 
to which Mr. Briggs seems to have objected was 
intended to point out that on the whole we have gained, 
even if certain desirable qualities have been lost, with 
the disappearance of the ' old-fashioned librarian.' Li- 
braries are popular and democratic where they formerly 
were exclusive and jealously guarded. Their faults are 
the faults of the age. At any rate, the discussion has 
had one gratifying point. Mr. Briggs says that he 
has ' repeatedly read the passage quoted again by the 
Transcript regarding the curmudgeon of olden time 
who kept his books under rusty lock and key.' Now, 
the only thing ' quoted ' was from • The Old Librarian's 
Almanac,' so we are led to the belief that Mr. Briggs 
is a reader of that fine old work. This is good news, 
indeed, and it is to be hoped that many others are fol- 
lowing this example. 'The Old Librarian's Almanac' 
deserves to be better known by the present generation."

THE DIAI. 



[April 16, 



French ignorance of things American sometimes 
reaches a pitch that is almost equivalent to contempt. 
But we need not take offense ; for the typical boulevardier 
is little better instructed in matters much nearer home. 
To him, Paris is France, and what lies beyond is all 
terra incognita and doesn't count. A delver into the 
archives of the French Academy has discovered some 
rather amusing evidences of an astonishing ignorance 
concerning so famous a man as George Washington. 
The Immortals did not even give him the title of 
" general," and apparently he was associated indiscrim- 
inately with " les officiers g^n^raux, le G^n^ral Gates 
et le G^n^ral Green." As for spelling his name with 
anything like correctness, that was not to be expected: 
the French dictionary-makers got as near to it aa 
«M. Wastington," "M. Wasinghton," and " Georgio 
Washinghon," and therewith remained content. If 
this was the best these learned gentlemen could do, what 
was to be expected of playwrights and actors in their 
attempts to exploit an illustrious name ? What could 
the French tongue make out of either W or sh f The 
climax was reached in 1785, when there appeared on 
the stage a character designated as " Vazington fils," a 
son of George Washington. In Sauvigny's " La Libertd 
du Nouveau Monde," we find Vazington (p'ere, not Jils, 
this time) declaiming the following heroic lines: 

" J'ai rempli les devoirs d'un citoyen fid^e. 
Et si quelque succes a couronn6 mon z^e, 
Je le dois aux euerriers dont I'h^roique ardeur 
De mes nobles travaux a partage I'honneur." 

Could anything be less Washingtonian ? But certain 
other famous Americans fared little better. In the 
catalogue of the Salon for 1789, Houdon's bust of 
Jefferson is entered as " M. Sefferson, Envoyd des Etats 
de Virginie." These and other entertaining matters of 
the same sort have been communicated to the Boston 
" Transcript " by Mr. Howard P. Arnold, of Pasadena, 
Cal. 

A self-contradictory characterization of 
American literary style appears in the March 
"Blackwood," from the sprightly pen of Mr. Charles 
Whibley, who takes such delight in describing his late 
visit to this country. In his paper on " American Lit- 
erature " he declares that " the writers of America have 
lagged honourably behind their age. The wisest of 
them have written with a studious care and quiet rev- 
erence." " The new world, to its honour be it said, has 
discovered no new art of letters. The land, where all 
else is characteristic, has made few attempts to impose 
its character upon the literary language." But after 
thus praising our men of letters for their faithful fol- 
lowing of the old English models, he says, a few pages 
further on: " The whole continent is pegged out in 
well-acknowledged claims. Boston cultivates one style, 
Chicago another. Each corner makes the most of its 
own material, and cheerfully discovers to the other 
States its character and temperament. The result is 
of great and varied interest." Chicago he singles out 
for such peculiar praise as must be quoted here. " That 
admirable literature should come from Chicago," he 
writes, " is of itself a paradox. It is still more sur- 
prising that the best writers of Chicago should display 
the qualities of tranquillity and reticence, which you 
would expect least of all to find in that monstrous city. 
Yet it is characteristic of Miss Edith Wyatt and Mr. 
H. B. Fuller, who have painted the manners of Chicago 
with the greatest skill, that they never force the note. 
They look upon their fellow-citizens with an amiable 



sympathy; they describe them with quiet humour." Mr. 
Whibley's article should be read in full, even if one 
cannot take it all as gospel truth. 
• • • 
A NEW Shakespeare memorial for London has 
at last been definitely projected. Naturally it is to 
take the form of a statue. An able committee, which 
includes the President of the Royal Academy, Mr. 
Sidney Colvin, and Professor Gollancz, has chosen a fine 
site in Park Crescent, and secured King Edward's con- 
sent to the transference of the statue of the Duke of 
Kent now standing there to another position. It is 
proposed that the new statue shall be a world's tribute 
to the poet, and accordingly all civilized nations are to 
be invited to join the British Empire and America in 
the erection of a worthy memorial. Meanwhile the 
annual Shakespeare festival, in memory of the poet's 
birthday, is to come off as usual this month, imder the 
capable and Iqving direction of Mr. F. R. Benson. The 
theatrical performances will continue nightly for three 
weeks from April 20, and on April 30 there will be 
a Shakespearean costume ball in the town hall at 
Stratford. Mr. Forbes Robertson as Hamlet, Mr. Lewis 
Waller as Henry V., Mr. Henry Ainley as Romeo, Miss 
Genevieve Ward as Queen Margaret in " Richard III.," 
and Mr. Poel and the Elizabethan Stage Society in 
"Measure for Measure," are among those who will 
assist Mr. Benson and his always thoroughly trust- 
worthy company in the Shakespearean productions. 
Such a memorial as the Shakespeare festivals may be 
less lasting than monuments of marble or bronze, but 
it is certainly quite as strongly marked by the spirit of 
true remembrance. ... 

A VETERAN librarian's RETIREMENT that will attract 
attention abroad as well as at home, and that will be 
deeply regretted by the community he has so long and 
so acceptably served, is that of Mr. Samuel Swett 
Green, for thirty-seven years head of the Worcester 
(Mass.) Public Library, of which he became a trustee 
forty-one years ago for a term of four years. Native of 
Worcester, his home-keeping has brilliantly contradicted 
the Shakespearean adage: his many honors and offices, 
and his many services to the cause of culture, have 
demonstrated his wits to be by no means " homely." 
Already known to the world of literature, he asks to be 
relieved of his library duties in order that he may devote 
himself to still further literary work ; but it is probable 
that his successor will not be appointed before next year. 
Worthy of passing note is the fact that under Mr. Green's 
administration the Worcester library was the first in New 
England to open its doors on Sunday, and also (so rumor 
declares) the first in the world to allow the renewal 
of books by telephone. Other useful innovations are 
credited to him, and he has always shown himself re- 
sponsive to suggestions and a vigUant foe to that lifeless 
routine into which librarians have been known to settle 
in somnolent content. ... 

Shakespeare on a merry-go-round would be a 
ciu-ious spectacle to us, but probably not more so, nor 
so much so, as would have been to him the sight of his 
plays as now presented in Berlin on the Reinhardt 
Revolving Stage, or Drehbuhne, whereby the scenes can 
all be expeditiously rendered in the original order and 
without the customary waits for scene-shifting and stage- 
setting. A spectator of these Reinhardt productions at 
the Deutsches Theater says, among other interesting 
things : " It may seem trivial to lay such stress upon

technique, but in Shakespeare, as in all the masters of 
dramatic art, the form is an expression and a part of the 
idea. The Deutsches Theater, presenting the play in 
its entirety, has manifested the structure of ' Twelfth 
Night ' as I have never seen it revealed before. The 
untangling of the plot in the last act, in particular, one 
of the consummate masterpieces of dramatic technique, 
stands out in wonderful relief. It moved me deeply 
in the beautiful production by Mr. Sothern and Miss 
Marlowe, but if I compare my two impressions I see 
that then I was stirred by Shakespeare alone, while 
Herr Reinhardt supports the dramatist to the full with 
the subtle art of the stage manager. He has prepared 
for the untangling, moreover, by bringing out what I 
have never seen shown on the stage before, the tangling 
of the plot in the third act." We shall soon have 
Shakespeare served up in styles to suit all tastes — from 
the studied simplicity of the Ben Greet Players to the 
elaborate perfection of the Reinhardt Revolving Stage.

A EivAL TO Sir Boyle Roche, in the matter of bulls, 
has been discovered in an editor quoted (or reported to 
have been quoted) at a dinner party by Mr. Edwin 
Markham. " When I was teaching in Los Angeles," 
are Mr. Markham's alleged words, " I used to read 
every week a little country paper whose editor's meta- 
phors were an unfailing joy to me." Three examples 
of marvellously mixed metaphors are then cited. First, 
concerning a contemporary whose truthfulness was 
questioned by the editor : " Thus the black lie, issuing 
from his base throat, becomes a boomerang in his hand, 
and, hoisting him by his own petard, leaves him a 
marked man for life.' Next, in an article on home 
life : " The faithful watchdog or his good wife, standing 
at the door, welcomes the master home with an honest 
bark." And finally, in a notice of a farmer's death: 
"The race was run at last. Like a tired steed he 
crossed the harbor bar, and, casting aside whip and 
spur, lay down upon that bourne from which no traveller 
returns." The smile that these examples, if they are 
not too outrageous, may elicit, would be called forth a 
himdred times a day if one stopped to take thought of 
the original meaning of the separate words in scores of 
phrases that have become, by use and convention, as little 
noticeable for incongruity as, for instance, the shining 
cylinder adorning the head of a man of fashion, or the 
flapping skirts that make walking a weariness to women. 
We all mix our metaphors as unavoidably as we all 
observe, to some extent at least, senseless conventions.

The pine tree poetry of Japan has received some 
very considerable additions in the last few months. At 
the recent time-honored festival of " the Reading of 
Poems," held annually in the presence of the Japanese 
Emperor and Empress, the subject set was " Shato no 
Matsu," or « The Pine Tree before the Temple Ground." 
Competing for the honor of being read in the august 
presence, some thirty thousand poems were sent in, says 
a writer in " The Japan Times." The pine tree seems 
to hold in Japan much the same place as the oak in 
England The cherry blossom is, of course, the national 
flower; but, says a native writer, " we have not only the 
quick beauty of the cherry blossom, whose pride is in 
its falling without complaint. There is a beauty which 
is feminine ; and also manly beauty. I am rather sus- 
picious that the cherry blossom belongs to the former 
sort of beauty ; and I believe that there must be some 
other tree to represent our manliness and strength; I 



find the national ideal in the pine tree. Look at the 
pine tree, which will give you a divine suggestion if you 
see it keeping at a distance, and again inspire you with 
its strength if you are near to it; now it will appear to 
you as a man of powers and command, now as a prophet 
who scorns the world and dust. . . . There is no other 
tree like the pine in expressing such manliness and 
nobility." This, and more in similar strain, is calculated 
to appeal to anyone who has ever listened to the summer 
breeze whispering in the pine-tops, or heard the blast 
of winter smite " his thimder-harp of pines." But there 
is another avenue of appeal not noticed by this Japanese 
writer : the wholesome fragrance of the pine is not to 
be left out of account. Are there any associations more 
vivid than those connected with the sense of smell?

The Johnson bicentenary is close upon us, and re- 
newed appeal comes from the Mayor of Lichfield (Mr. 
W. R. Coleridge-Roberts) for contributions to complete 
the restoration of the lexicographer's birthplace, which 
is now set apart as a Johnson Library and Museum. 
The old bookshop (of Dr. Johnson's father) on the 
ground floor has been restored as nearly as possible to 
its original state, the modern shop front having been 
replaced by a double window in eighteenth-century 
style. "The ancient floor has been made secure," we 
are informed, " the old oak beams of the ceiling have 
been thrown open to view, and other work has been 
done to restore the shop to the state in which it existed 
in the olden days. We are now anxious," continues the 
Mayor, " to proceed with the Birth-room above the 
shop, to reveal the oak panelling, and to make manifest 
the other features of interest which prevailed when Dr. 
Johnson was born. Other rooms, and the roof, require 
renovation and reparation. . . . We wish to maintain 
the building as a memorial of the great and good man 
born there, and to hand it on to future generations of 
the English-speaking race."

The ethics of " skipping " might move to long and 
tiresome argument, for and against. Does the habit of 
skipping, even judicious skipping, if acquired early, tend 
to superficiality and lack of thoroughness? Or does it 
promote intellectual independence and train the judg- 
ment ? With what an outburst of contempt Dr. 
Johnson retorted on a questioner who had asked him, 
in regard to a certain book, whether he had read it 
through. "No," thundered Johnson; "do you, sir, 
ever read a book through ? " A decidedly Johnsonian 
position is taken by Mr. Henry R. Tedder, Secretary and 
Librarian of the Athenaeum, in his paper on " The 
Librarian in Relation to Books," read before the Library 
Association at Glasgow, and now published by a London 
house. " Most young people," he says, " are disgusted 
at the very threshold of life by being told that they 
must read all books through. Nothing is more ridicu- 
lous than this recommendation. None but the very best 
should be read from cover to cover, and not even the 
best is worth reading when it begins to weary."

The awakening of Rochester readers has come 
at last. That city and New Orleans are the only large 
cities in the country that have thus far found life toler- 
able without a public library. But now the citizens of 
one of these places at least are asking for better things. 
Their wishes are voiced by the mayor in his annual 
message and by the superintendent of education in his 
yearly report. " The establishment of a public library," 
declares Mayor Edgerton, " is much to be desired, and 
I earnestly hope that means may be provided to accom- 
plish this result." And Superintendent Carroll says: 
" The lack of this delayed public necessity is a most 
serious defect in our educational system, and retards 
relatively the intelligence and culture of the entire 
community." We should regard the retardation as 
positive and imqualifled. Now let us hear from New 
Orleans. , , ,

important still, Mr. Dickinson has been chosen as next 
year's IngersoU lecturer at Harvard. This lectureship, 
established a few years ago by a bequest from the late

Immortality of Man," and has been filled by Professors 
Royce, Miinsterberg, James, and Palmer, and other

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



LIBRARIES AND BOOK-LOVERS. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

As I have read Mr. Briggs's complaint about the 

increasing scarcity of book-lovers among librarians, 

followed by Mr. Bailey's comment, I have wondered 

how far libraries may be responsible for the increasing 



scarcity of book-lovers in the world. Isn't it true that 
to love books one must live with them ? Nowadays the 
average person, and even the average family, depends 
entirely upon libraries for reading matter. We don't 
buy books ; we borrow them, — not as the book-lover 
borrows, to return no more, but with a business-like 
proviso that the volumes are unfailmgly to be brought 
back by a certain specified date, failing in which we 
pay a fine. Reading thus becomes a business, to be dis- 
posed of within a definite period. " Seven-day Book," 
tagged on to all the new fiction and some of the more 
popular essays and biographies — who can become 
deeply attached to a " Seven-day Book " ? What real 
friendship with a book ever developed even within the 
more generous allotment of two weeks, the regular 
library prescription ? 

Being country-born and bred, I grew up in a home 
blessed with books. Ours was not an especially large or 
well-chosen library, but it looms to vast and classic pro- 
portions when compared with the constantly changing 
shelf-full of rapidly aging current fiction that forms the 
only apology for a library in many homes of a younger 
and more sophisticated generation. When I am away 
from my own books and need to consult a play of 
Shakespeare or a volume of Thackeray or Rxiskin, I 
proffer my request at the library window with a feel- 
ing that it requires explanation. But it doesn't; the 
business-like librarian sees no anomaly in the cultured 
person's getting any book where all books are to be 
had gratis. As a business matter this is sound, but it 
doesn't appeal to the book-lover. He haunts the shops, 
not the public libraries, and he treasures his own books, 
bought very often at a sacrifice of other necessities, as 
he would never value the privilege of consulting, with 
regulations, a thousand times their number. The sense 
of possession enters, however slightly, into every form 
of real affection. Who can feel it — who indeed has 
the right to feel it — towards the scarred and battered 
denizens of the Public Library shelves ?

FICTION IN THE BOSTON AND TRENTON 

LIBRARIES. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In the " Casual Comment " department of The Dial 
for April 1, your comparison of the fiction departments 
of the Boston Public Library and the Trenton, N. J., 
Library is hardly fair, — possibly for the reason that the 
library reports are not plain to you. The statement 
that the Boston Public Library " has in three consecutive 
years purchased 129, 161, and 167 novels from the 
great mass of English fiction examined by the Commit- 
tee " is possibly correct. It means titles, however, not 
volumes. Only the report of the librarian will show 
how many copies of each title were placed in the library, 
or how many volumes were purchased to replace those 
worn out. 

The Trenton library added 1882 volumes of fiction. 
To a library worker this covers all new titles and replace- 
ments, including stories in the children's department. 

I am not defending the fiction department of the 
Trenton library, but merely attempting to get the 
matter right from a library standpoint.

Lord Cromer ox Modern Egypt.* 

The marvellous transformation wrought out 
in Egypt under British rule, and the methods 
by which it was accomplished, have come to be 
a favorite theme for retired Anglo-Egyptian 
statesmen. Some years ago Lord Milner pub- 
lished his " England in Egypt "; a few months 
ago Sir Auckland Colvin's " The Making of 
Modern Egypt " was reviewed in The Dial ; 
and now we have Lord Cromer's " Modern 
Egypt," in two handsome volumes. Of all 
those who have told the story of English rule 
in Egypt no one is so well equipped for the 
task, and, it may be added, no one has per- 
formed the task so weU, as Lord Cromer. 
His official career in Egypt began even before 
English occupation (March, 1877), and con- 
tinued to 1907, when he retired full of years 
and honors. Parliament showing its appreciation 
of his long and distinguished services by voting 
him a grant of fifty thousand pounds. During 
this long period of nearly thirty years Lord 
Cromer was, as he says, " behind the scenes in 
Egyptian affairs," and English achievements 
there were more the result of his masterly in- 
fluence than of anything else. 

The author's purpose in writing this book 
was, he says, first, "to place on record an ac- 
curate narrative of some of the principal events 
which have occurred in Egypt since 1876," 
and, second, " to explain the results which have 
accrued to Egypt from the British occupation 
of the country in 1882." In addition to the 
wealth of material that has come from his own 
extended observations and his acquaintanceship 
with almost everyone who has taken a leading 
part in Egyptian affairs since the beginning 
of English occupation, he has had access to aU 
the documents in the archives of the Foreign 
Offices of both London and Cairo. The re- 
markable story of Egypt under British ride has 
been told by Lord Cromer with a straightfor- 
wardness, an accuracy, and a charm of style 
never equalled in any other work dealing with 
the subject. 

From a recital of the financial chaos which led 
to British intervention in 1882 Lord Cromer 
reviews in succession the history of the country 
under the guiding hand of English statesmen, 
the rise and fall of Pashas and Khedives, the 
triumphs of the Eng lish Army of occupation,

the thrilling story of Gordon, the fall and re- 
conquest of Khartoum, the problems of political 
readjustment and reconstruction, and the final 
withdrawal of French opposition through the 
Anglo-French Convention of 1904, which leaves 
England a free hand to carry out to full com- 
pletion the great task she began twenty-five 
years ago. Of this latter event Lord Cromer 
says : " I rejoice that my connection lasted long 
enough to enable me to see the friendly relations 
of the past reestablished after an interlude of 
misunderstanding which was detrimental alike 
to British, French, and Egyptian interests." 
Of the justification of the English occupation 
Lord Cromer has never entertained any doubt 
except as an academic question. The cannon 
which swept away the Dervish hordes at 
Omdurman, he says, proclaimed to the world 
that on England had devolved tTie solemn and 
responsible duty of introducing, the light of 
Western civilization amongst the sorely tried 
people of the Soudan. The change which has 
taken place in Egypt under British occupation 
is, he declares, nothing less than remarkable, 
and can be fully appreciated only by those who 
are in some degree familiar with the system 
under which the country was governed in the 
days of Ismail Pasha. The extent of the change 
is well summarized by Lord Cromer in the fol- 
lowing words : 

" A new spirit has been instilled into the population 
of Egypt. Even the peasant has leamt to scan his rights. 
Even the Pasha has learnt that others besides himself 
have rights which must be respected. The courbash 
may hang on the walls of Moudirieh, but the Moudir 
no longer dares to employ it on the backs of the 
fellaheen. For all practical purposes, it may be said 
that the hateful corvde system has disappeared. Slav- 
ery has virtually ceased to exist. The halcyon days 
of the adventurer and the usurer are past. Fiscal 
burthens have been greatly relieved. Everywhere law 
reigns supreme. Justice is no longer bought and sold. 
Nature, instead of being spurned and neglected, has 
been wooed to bestow her gifts on mankind. She has 
responded to the appeal. The waters of the Nile are 
now utilized in an intelligent manner. Means of loco- 
motion have been improved and extended. The soldier 
has acquired some pride in the imiform which he wears. 
He has fought as he never fought before. The sick 
man can be nursed in a well-managed hospital. The 
lunatic is no longer treated like a wild beast. The 
punishment awarded to the worst criminal is no longer 
barbarous. Lastly, the schoolmaster is abroad, with 
results which are as yet uncertain, but which cannot 
fail to be important." 

The difficulties of England's task and the 
embarrassments of the great pro-consul's own 
position were indeed large. Between the English- 
man and the Egyptian there was a " thick mist " 
composed of " religious prejudice, antique and

semi-barbarous customs, international rivalry, 
vested interests and aspirations of one sort and 
another, some sordid, others not ignoble but 
incapable of realization." Cromer tells us that 
at times he had " to retire into his own diplo- 
matic shell " and pose as one amongst many 
representatives of foreign powers. At other 
times he had to step forward as the representa- 
tive of the Sovereign whose soldiers had Egypt 
in their grip. At one time he had to defend 
Egypt against European aggression, and some- 
times in the early days to defend the British 
position against foreign attack. He had to keep 
in touch with the weU-intentioned, but occasion- 
ally iU-informed, public opinion of England, to 
maintain British authority and at the same time 
hide as much as possible the fact that he was 
maintaining it, to work through British agents 
over whom he possessed no control, to avoid any 
step which might involve European complication, 
to keep the Egyptian question simmering, and 
to avoid any action which might tend to force on 
its premature consideration, etc. 

Of the future of Egypt Lord Cromer thinks 
there are two alternative courses : either it must 
become autonomous, or it must be incorporated 
into the British Empire, and his own personal 
preference is in favor of moving in the direction 
of the former alternative. He does not, however, 
favor the immediate or even the early withdrawal 
of Great Britain, but only the adoption of a policy 
looking toward that step as an ultimate goal. Of 
the many delusions which at one time existed 
about Egypt, the greatest of all, he says, is the 
idea that England can shake herself free of the 
Egyptian Question merely by withdrawing the 
British garrison and then declaring to the world 
that the Egyptians must get on as well as they 
can by themselves. A fairly good and stable 
government must be insured until the Egyptians 
are capable of governing themselves without the 
presence of a foreign army in their midst, and 
without foreign guidance in civil and military- 
affairs. That time Lord Cromer thinks has not 
yet come, but, on the contrary, is far distant, and 
one or two generations must pass away before 
the question can even be usefully discussed.

The Neav Dictionary of Artists.* 

A general book of reference covering the 
artists of the world, with their names in alpha- 
betical order and a critical notice of each artist, 
is so very important to us aU that it seems worth 
while to consider what there is, and what there 
may be, in that field. Of the new book, in twenty 
large volumes, whose title is given below, only one 
volume is as yet in being ; but that one volume 
may be compared with the books which already 
exist. Nagler's " AllgemeinesKiinstler-lexikon" 
was the standby of a former generation ; but, 
having been completed in 1852, it is neither 
full enough nor critical enough for the twen- 
tieth century. Dr. J. Meyer with his associates 
undertook, in 1870, such a revision and enlarge- 
ment of Nagler as was then possible ; but that 
work has never passed the third volume and the 
name " Bezzuoli." The scheme of those two 
works was nearly universal, — an alphabet of 
surnames of all who had produced works of 
fine art worthy of mention ; and, as the Nagler 
work extended to twenty-two volumes, it was 
reasonably full. 

On a much smaller scale, but with equal 
completeness of scheme, the " Allgemeines 
Kiinstler-Lexikon " which bore the name of 
Seubert filled three octavo volumes, as against 
the twenty-two somewhat larger volumes of 
Nagler. It was the most useful of ready 
reference books, until superseded by newer 
editions of practically the same book under 
other distinctive names. The edition in five 
volumes, dated 1895-1901, bears on the title- 
pages the names of H. A. MiiUer and H. W. 
Singer. No one who is in search of an inex- 
pensive dictionary of artists need hope for a 
better book than the one last named ; and with 
the naming of it the subject of the universal 
lexicon may be dismissed until the seeker takes 
up the first volume of Thieme and Becker. 
All other similar books of reference are limited 
in scope, and restricted in one or another 
fashion. 

Bryan's " Dictionary of Painters and En- 
gravers " is nearly a century old, but we need 
not reckon with any edition earlier than that 
revised by Graves and Armstrong and finished 
in 1889. That book again was superseded by 
the reissue imder the charge of G. C. Williamson 
and published in five very large volumes during

1903-5. It has one excellent feature, — a 
table of the works of each artist thought nota- 
ble, the classification being by museums and 
galleries of art as far as might be. Complete- 
ness in this was not proposed, — obviously it 
would be impracticable, — and there are even 
exceptions to the rule of its introduction, as 
where the long notice of William Blake offers 
no list at all of his productions, but names some 
of them only in the course of critical remark. 
The true limitations to the utility of Bryan are, 
however, to be found in its insularity of scope. 
It was said long ago that the English art student 
rarely sees anything important in painting except 
the works of the great Italians and those of the 
Englishmen who have studied, and followed or 
refused to follow, the early Italians ; that he is 
prone to skip over two and one-half centuries, 
and all of Europe which lies between the Alps 
and the Channel. The Bryan Dictionary seems 
to have been put together as if to confirm that 
view in a slightly modified form, so extraor- 
dinary are the omissions, and so odd to a general 
student of graphic art are the proportions 
observed. And then, again, Bryan deals only 
with the artists who have died (excepting one or 
two who are mentioned as having abandoned the 
practice of their art), and on this account is 
destined to pass out of date at a relatively early 
period. This is true of " Painters and their 
Works " by R. N. James, in three not large 
volumes ; a book otherwise weU fitted for daily 
reference when painting, only, is in question. 

The " Encyclopaedia of Painters and Paint- 
ings," edited by Champlin and Perkins, and 
brought down to 1887, is strictly confined to 
its own subject. In like manner, Redgrave's 
admirable " Dictionary of Artists of the English 
School," published in 1874, is evidently of small 
scope — made smaller by the exclusion of living 
artists. It is nearly so with Clement and 
Hutton's " Artists of the Nineteenth Century," 
published in 1879, and with the famous books of 
reference for print-coUeetors by Bartsch and 
Passavant and less known authors, and with 
Anderson's " Descriptive and Historical Cata- 
logue of Japanese and Chinese Paintings " — 
these special books are material for a universal 
dictionary like Thieme and Becker ; it is unjust 
to all concerned to institute any comparison 
between them. 

Comparison of one volume of such a work 
with corresponding parts of other dictionaries 
is likely to be ineffective, because of differences 
of method. Bryan, for instance, treats the 
subject " Allegri (Antonio) " in a fuU notice, 



" Andrea d'Agnolo " rather too briefly, and 
" Androuet," the architect and draughtsman of 
the French Renaissance, in thirty lines besides 
a list of items ; but the new book refers these 
terms to " Correggio," " Sarto (A. del)," and 
" Ducerceau." Perhaps we may like the English- 
man's method of treating each subject under the 
name of the artist rather than the surname or 
the nickname. Such a method is more capable 
of consistent use throughout ; even as the 
English " Dictionary of National Biography " 
prefers family names, such as Cecil and Caven- 
dish, to titles of nobility, as Salisbury and 
Devonshire ; but all this is really indifferent. 
Sometimes the two books reverse their practice. 
" Fra Angelico " is turned over to " Fiesole " 
in the English book, but has in Thieme and 
Becker twelve columns (six pages) under 
" Angelico." 

In other items, comparison is more feasible 
and more instructive. Andrea Andreani, the 
name signed to so many chiaroscuro prints of 
the sixteenth century, has thirty lines in Bryan, 
followed by a long list of the titles of prints ; 
while in the German book there is reference to 
Bartsch for the needed list of prints, and four 
solid columns of critical discussion of the many 
doubtfid questions about this mass of work,

the limit of favor, as the preface declares — in 
the German book. James and Robert Adam, 
the eighteenth century architects of London 
fame, have their full share of notice ; and of 
these two, Robert, the author of the great 
study of the Roman palace at Spalato, is 
accepted as the more important personality. 
There are many architects whose record is 
found in Thieme and Becker. Alkamenes, the 
friend of Phidias, has six columns as against 
one-fifth as much space under " Alcamenes " in 
Smith's " Dictionary of Greek and Roman 
Biography and Mythology," and about the 
same allowance of room in the Pauly-Wissowa 
' ' Real-Encyclopaedie . ' ' Andronikos of Kyrrhos 
in Syria, known to English writers as Cyrrhestes, 
and famous as the builder of the " Tower of the 
Winds " at Athens, has a column-long notice : 
though he is called a founder or deviser, rather 
than an artist. Anthemios of Tralles, the great 
man to whom, with the able assistance of Isidoros 
of Miletos, the world owes Sancta Sophia at 
Constantinople, has his five columns. Abadie, 
the French architect, who died in 1884, is per- 
fectly well studied in the short notice which 
specifies his chief title to our remembrance — 
though the hatred he excited as the " restorer " 
of Saint Front at Perigueux could hardly be 
discussed. 

Alexander Anderson, the American wood- 
engraver born in 1775, has half a column, and 
of him it is said that he was the first in America 
to use box- wood for engraving — namely, in 
" The Looking Glass for the Mind," published 
1795-8. Under the term " Aligny" is given 
a notice of the landscape painter more often 
spoken of as Theodore CarueUe d'Aligny and 
studied as an engraver and etcher. Vapereau's 
" Dictionnaire des Contemporains " tells of him ; 
but the German notice is fuller and much more 
critical. It is interesting, this hunting for the 
little-known men, like Alfarano, whom we asso- 
ciate with our only artistic record of the ancient 
basilica of Saint Peter on the Vatican hill. The 
only notice of him to be discovered in a modem 
book of reference is here ; and care is taken to 
point out that he is not necessarily the draughts- 
man or the engraver, but perhaps the ecclesias- 
tical dignitary, — the patron, only. 

Artists of the farthest East are included in 
this new book, — as where Aimi, called Soken, 
a Japanese of the ninth or tenth century A. D., 
is named as having been a member of the 
national commission on painting : " Regierungs- 
kommission fiir Malerei." Has not that phrase 
a modern sound ? Ameya was a Korean or a 



Chinese, who in the sixteenth century A.D. 
established a school of potters in Japan. He 
was naturalized, and took the name Sokei, 
founding the family known as Sasaki. Moslem 
builders and carvers, in Egypt and in Spain, 
are to be found under " Al-Kutami," and under 
the often recurring name " Abdallah." A name 
foimd on an Arabic vessel, exhibited in 1878, 
has introduced us to the potter, Abd-el-Fakir 
El Hadjaj-Mohammed. Byzantine painting of 
the Cretan school in the seventeenth century is 
named under " Angelos Kres." Makers and 
painters of Greek vases are, of course, numerous. 
The result of a long examination of the 
volume is an enthusiastic hope that here, at 
last, we are to have an adequate dictionary of 
artists. A new volume every four or six months

A German View^ of the Great 
English Commoner.* 



When Dr. Albert von Ruville published his 
German biography of the Earl of Chatham, 
three years ago, it was recognized at once that 
the career of that vigorous and picturesque 
statesman had at last found a student who was 
equal to the task. English and American 
reviewers found much to criticize: in a few 
instances the author was convicted of errors 
that careful study should have corrected ; many 
of his more important conclusions were chal- 
lenged ; and attention was called to a number of 
ludicrous mistakes, largely the result of careless 
proof-reading. But after all this had been said, 
the unusual merit of the work had to be granted. 
That such a work would be speedily translated 
into English was to be expected ; and such a 
translation has now appeared. In its English 
form, the biography comprises three solid vol- 
umes of about four hundred pages each. The 
first volume deals with the usual subjects intro- 
ductory to such a study — Pitt's ancestry, educa- 
tion, and introduction to life, and carries the 
narrative of his official career down to the 
declaration of war against France in 1756 ; the 
second reveals to us the great statesman and 
the war minister, and covers the eventftd years 
1756 to 1761 ; in the remaining volume is told 
the story of the long decline ending with Pitt's 
death in 1778. 

The leading facts of Pitt's career are a matter

of common historical knowledge, and it was not 
to be expected that recent research would modify 
the general outline to any appreciable extent. 
Dr. von RuvQle sees the course of eighteenth- 
century history very much as it has been viewed 
before ; still, his work differs greatly from the 
English writings on the same subject. His 
attitude is that of a critic, not an advocate, and 
censure frequently appears where formerly we 
were accustomed to find unqualified praise. 
Different and apparently far more just are also 
his estimates of the men who shared with Pitt 
the duties and cares of government. With all 
his faults (and the author does not conceal 
them), Newcastle was at bottom a strong man 
and a keen politician, not the incompetent that 
some have described. The estimate of Lord 
Bute is also favorable : in unselfish patriotism 
and devotion to king and country he is more 
than Pitt's equal. George III. seems less of 
an enemy to the British constitution after one 
has read von Ruville's masterful analysis of the 
political situation in the earlier years of the new 
reign. Another important feature is the promi- 
nence given to Continental affairs ; for the first 
time, perhaps, the importance of the Prussian 
alliance is stated at its true value. It may be 
said in this connection that the author's opinion 
of the English military leaders of the Seven 
Years' War is anything but high ; but impartial 
justice is hardly to be expected from a German 
critic whose interest in the subject grew out of 
a study in the military career of the great 
Frederick. 

The value of Dr. von Ruville's work is not 
so much in the carefully constructed narrative 
as in the discussions of social and political forces, 
in the revealing of secret motives and hidden 
influences, in the insight afforded into the polit- 
ical workings of the Whig system. But the 
Author's strength is also his weakness ; conclu- 
sions and inferences of this nature are usually 
based on circumstantial evidence, and in the use 
of such evidence a temper is often displayed that 
is neither judicious nor fair. 

We have long been in the habit of regarding 
Pitt as the incorruptible commoner, the great 
orator, the lover of peace, and the friend of 
American liberty. This conception, though 
possibly correct in outline, is doubtless highly 
idealized. That Pitt was impervious to the 
ordinary means of corruption, von Ruville freely 
concedes ; but he believes that at times even he 
yielded to influences of the baser sort. His 
" singular behavior in 1744, when he joined 
against his principles the party which was 



anxious to throw itself unconditionally into the 
arms of the Pelhamites," the author attributes 
to a legacy left him in the will of the Duchess 
of Marlborough, whom he now became anxious 
to please. Similarly, his violent opposition to 
the men who made the peace of Paris in 1763 
was based, not on principle, but on a desire to 
satisfy an aged, eccentric, unreasoning, but 
wealthy Whig lord. Sir William Pynsent, who 
had made Pitt his heir to extensive estates in 
Somersetshire. His neutral position on the 
American question, in 1774, is attributed to a 
similar motive. The author apparently accepts 
the explanation of the Prussian ambassador : 
" He has two young sons to place, and only two 
months ago the king presented the elder of these 
with an ensign's commission." In discussing 
Pitt's agitation for parliamentary reform, von 
Ruville characterizes his political morality in 
the following terms : 

" In this, as in all cases, his objects were eminently 
practical and selfish. He supported everything that 
could help his plans, and opposed all that thwarted them; 
at a comparatively early date he had conceived the idea, 
though he had not elaborated it, that an excellent foun- 
dation of success might be laid by the strictest possible 
observance of political morality, and by the adoption of 
a certain lofty and disinterested attitude upon sordid 
questions of ways and means." 

To this. Professor Egerton, in his " general 
introduction," rejoins that " Had such been the 
real Pitt, it would hardly have been necessary 
for Dr. von Ruville to write those volumes of 
his biography." 

Nor is the author impressed with Pitt's great- 
ness as an orator. His manner was impressive, 
but in argument he was often weak. The biog- 
rapher makes a laborious attempt to place this 
conclusion on a historic foundation, but without 
success, as no such foundation can be built ; all 
that we know of the matter of Pitt's speeches 
is derived from the memories of those who heard 
them. That Pitt affected the dramatic, is evi- 
dent ; we are told that he even used his old 
enemy, the gout, to give emphasis to his oratory. 
Perhaps the best Ulustration of this is his appear- 
ance in Parliament in January, 1745, which is 
thus described : 

" Pitt then made a highly dramatic appearance. His 
stay in Bath had given him little benefit, and he was 
still suffering from the gout, though it may be doubted 
whether his sufferings were as serious as he asserted. 
In any case he appeared wrapped in bandages, supported 
upon crutches, and provided with the necessaries of an 
invalid; and thus aroused the general attention. Then 
he raised his powerful voice and pointed to his bandaged 
limbs as evidence of the importance of a debate which 
would have brought him to the spot even upon the last 
day of his life."

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



The point of criticism that in this case any 
verbal reference to the speaker's illness should 
have been unnecessary, is doubtless well taken. 
But the author adds that " Pitt's behavior in 
the course of his speech, in which he rose to his 
full height and gesticulated vigorously" really 
made it necessary for him " to strengthen the 
belief in his sufferings ... by outward show 
and by strong reference to his malady." 

For Americans who remember Pitt principally 
for the stand he took on the colonial question 
in the closing years of his life, it is easy to hold 
the honored idea that Pitt was eminently a 
believer in conciliation and peace. The real 
facts, on the contrary, show that his passion was 
war ; in earlier life he had hoped for an import- 
ant military command ; later, his great desire 
was to have the management of a war. He used 
his office as paymaster-general, not to acquire a 
familiarity with financial details, but " to extend 
his military knowledge, and to gain special in- 
formation of movements against the enemy." 
When he entered the ministry, in 1757, it was 
expressly stipulated that Pitt was to have the 
conduct of the war then raging. And when the 
time came to treat with the enemy, his terms 
were not such as to indicate any great longing 
for peace. 

" Chatham's greatness did not lie in counsel, 
in his home or his foreign policy ; it lay entirely 
in action. It was when decision was taken, when 
he was placed in authority and the time had 
come to act, that he showed what he was." Von 
Ruville's second volume is a commentary on 
these sentences. The Seven Years' War was 
Pitt's opportunity, — it enabled him to de- 
monstrate his great administrative abilities. 
Throughout this part of the work the treatment 
is sympathetic and appreciative ; for Pitt the 
war minister the author displays an admiration 
that does not extend to the orator in opposition. 
In this volume we are given a circumstantial 
history of this tremendous war, with the empha- 
sis on Pitt's wonderful management. His plans 
are detailed with painstaking care, those that 
failed as well as those that succeeded. But in 
this discussion, too, the minister is at times given 
scant justice : it is hard to believe that in ap- 
pointing General Abercrombie to the American 
command, Pitt purposely selected a weak gen- 
eral, since " a man of greater capacity than 
Loudoun . . . might easily have proved obsti- 
nate and inconvenient in the important position 
of commander-in-chief." In 1761, when the 
war was drawing to a close, Pitt resigned, — 
but not, as is commonly thought, because he 



was forced to do so ; " it rather seems that Pitt, 
against the wish of the king and his colleagues, 
seized the opportunity of resignation." Condi- 
tions demanded either a change in policy or a 
new chief ; and Pitt found resignation easier 
than change. 

With Pitt's position on the American ques- 
tion, Dr. von Ruville is not in sympathy ; in a 
measure, he holds him responsible for the 
troubles that culminated in the Revolutionary 
War. Prior to the passage of the Stamp Act, the 
king had called him to the chief ministry ; but 
he had declined the honor. " His consideration 
of purely material interests, his hope of a con- 
siderable inheritance — for in no other way is 
his behavior to be explained — had prevented 
him from seizing the helm of state at the right 
moment and guiding the country through the 
difficulties of the American question to the 
shore of reconciliation." Pitt favored a large 
measure of seK-government for the colonies, 
but insisted at the same time on the supremacy 
of Parliament. He would relieve them of the 
burden of internal taxation, — their assemblies 
were the proper agencies for such purposes. 
But his arguments on the subjects of repre- 
sentation and taxation do not seem to have 
impressed his biographer very favorably: they 
were " more distinguished by enthusiasm for 
liberty than by legal insight." 

When Pitt in 1766, as Earl of Chatham, 
reentered the ministry and was called on to 
construct a colonial policy, we have another 
instance of his " singular behavior." He had 
now to choose between the conciliatory policy of 
Shelburne and the aggressive measures urged by 
Townshend. He refused, however, to make the 
choice, and referred the subject to Parliament. 
The author appears to believe that the prime 
minister felt himself committed to a line of action 
that he saw was impractiisal, but found with- 
drawal easier than the adoption of new plans. 

In 1773 Chatham's views appear to have 
been less favorable to the colonial cause : he 
was shocked at the news of the Boston Tea 
Party. In a speech in May of the following 
year, he practically demanded that the revolt 
be suppressed, but favored leniency as a matter 
of expediency. It is significant that in discuss- 
ing the Quebec Act he omitted all reference to 
the great grievance of the Americans, the matter 
of delimitation. But during the summer of this 
year he came under the influence of Benjamin 
Franklin, with the result that his views changed 
materially. A few months later, the demand 
was no longer for leniency, but for justice ; not

for suppression of a revolt, but for withdrawal 
of the English troops. Chatham's plan, laid 
before Parliament in January, 1775, "for set- 
tling the troubles in America," the author con- 
siders thoroughly impractical ; in England it 
had few friends, and in America " its proposals 
met with unambiguous condemnation." 

As the war progressed, Chatham came to 
believe that America could not be conquered ; 
at the same time, he refused to entertain the 
suggestion that American independence should 
be recognized. It is difficult to see how any- 
one holding such irreconcilable views could 
contribute much to the solution of the colonial 
problem after 1776. The suggestion that even 
as late as 1777 a ministry headed by Chatham 
might have evolved some plan of reconciliation 
finds no support in the present biography. 
William Pitt could carry out a policy, but 
could not initiate one ; he was an administrator, 
not a constructive statesman. It remains for 
future students to determine whether this view 
of " the Great Commoner " is historically cor- 
rect ; but Dr. von Ruville's study is the work 
of a master, and his conclusions cannot be 
lightly set aside. Laurence M. Larson. 



Another Interpretation of 
Buddhism.* 



The twentieth-century task of uniting and 
conciliating the Orient and the Occident calls 
to its behest every sort of interpreter. Let the 
scholar who has a conscience towards texts, 
history, science, and reason, nut despise those 
who from emotion and self -chosen bias set them- 
selves deliberately to " interpret " the East. 
We have had an example of one who retired 
from the Western world, making himself a sen- 
sitive plate to record his impressions of Japan, 
— which many among us receive as facts. Yet 
while the tints in the glasses worn may change, 
or may remain green or rose, the reality beneath 
abides. Even when one, mentally or in the 
body, retires from the white man's world and 
pictures Burma, we who cannot forget scrip- 
tures, or history, or science, or who know 
something of our own traditions, religion, and 
mentality, crave more matter-of-fact — even 
dry-as-dust bases of reality, and less rhapsody. 

Now, in judging H. Fielding Hall's latest 
book, " The Inward Light," we must differen- 
tiate between its lush vocabidary, its intoxicating 

♦ The Inward Light. By H. Fielding Hall. New York : The 
Macmillan Co. 



style, its quite feminine loveliness of method, on 
the one hand, and its strenuous claim to serious 
attention as truth on the other. Any panegyric, 
however extravagant, we are willing to bestow 
on its literary form. Charming, even enchant- 
ing, is this bit of philosophy disguised as a work 
of fiction. But as a presentation of Buddhism 
it lacks all the marks of serious acquaintance 
with originals or reality. " The West," the 
Christianity, and the history here presented are 
strangers to us, while the Buddhism set forth 
is neither of the Great nor the Lesser Vehicle. 
Even when we are told that " the day died in 
scarlet agony," and that " the couriers of the 
sun beat crimson light along the mountains," we 
still miss the real " color " of the East, though 
there is indeed much local Burmese " colour," 
as it might have been enjoyed by a sentimental 
Englishman. Any acquaintance with com- 
parative religion, apart from that common in 
insular British society and among the plain folk 
of Burma, we do not discern. 

Nevertheless this genuinely impressionable 
writer has made us his debtor because of the 
charm of his pen. He — or the printer's devil 
possibly — may spell "Musselmans " as " Mus- 
selmen," call Shinto a true system of ancestral 
worship, which it is not, show a woeful lack of 
acquaintance with Buddhist writings, and assert 
a thousand things, which, to one who knows a 
little of both East and West, sound like deli- 
cious nonsense. Nevertheless, profound sym- 
pathy and kindly intercourse have made him 
a generous exponent, if not an interpreter fair 
to other religions and races. Asia has still a 
secret, and blessed are they who seek to learn 
it. Even without a civilization built on iron and 
coal it is possible to catch glimpses of eternal 
truth, and, abiding therein, to find daily hap- 
piness. This is the burden of the book, and 
despite all cold and critical comment, the mes- 
sage is a moving one. Those who, at our libra- 
ries, are content with " popular " science, who 
take their history in the form of fiction, and 
their theology direct from their pastors, will 
be equally satisfied to regard this book as a 
true interpretation of the Aryan teaching and 
Agnostic faith — the product of " the Darwin 
of the soul." Only a few years ago, the Boston 
Brahmins accepted Sir Edwin Arnold's poem, 
" The Light of Asia," as a true exposition of 
Buddhism, when it was in fact only a subjective 
rhapsody tricked out in Christian phrase, and 
as true to real life as is Gilbert and Sullivan's 
extravaganza of " The Mikado " to Japanese 
history. William Elliot Griffis.

A Nativity Pi.ay in Mexico.* 



In its ninth Memoir, the American Folk-Lore 
Society presents the text and translation of a 
Mexican Play of the Nativity. In 1893 the 
veteran observer, Captain John G. Boiirke, 
called the attention of the Society to this play, 
in an article printed in its Journal. He saw 
the performance at Rio Grande City, Texas, in 
1891. It was given by a non-professional 
troupe of actors, most of whom could neither 
read nor write, who had been orally instructed 
in their parts by their leader — a cobbler. 
Captain Bourke had the leader write him out 
the full text. Two years later, at San Antonio, 
Texas, Captain Bourke found the same play 
again, and secured photogi-aphs of the per- 
formers and phonograph records of the songs. 
It is this material — text, photographs, and 
music — that is presented in the Memoir before 
us, under the editorship of Mr. M. R. Cole. 

Such plays are not uncommon in Mexico to- 
day. This one, in a somewhat variant form, was 
witnessed by the present reviewer in various 
villages around Guadalajara during the seasons 
between 1894 and 1897. Throughout this 
region the play is purely traditional. While 
many leaders and trainers have manuscripts of 
the text, we have never seen an actual printed 
copy. The play is regularly rendered by a local 
group of amateur players taught and trained by 
one who has committed the play to memory or 
owns a manuscript of the text. The actors are 
mostly boys and young men from ten to twenty- 
three or twenty-four years of age. The play is 
usually rendered for the first time on Christmas 
Eve, at the home town of the players. For 
several evenings following it is given by the same 
players at village after village in the neighbor- 
hood, usually as an open-air performance, on the 
streets ; and the players afterward, going about 
the village from house to house, expect pres- 
ents, — sweets, cakes, fruit, cigarettes, tequila, 
and money. 

The editor of this Memoir knows of the play 
as given at San Rafael, New Mexico, and at 
Pueblo, Mexico, — as well as at the Texas 
town reported by Captain Bourke ; and from its 
widely-separated occurrences he decides that 
" Los Pastores is an old play of Mexican origin." 
That the play was once common throughout 
Mexico, there can be no doubt. That it was 
played there through a long period of time is 
equally certain. When a large section of

lation, Introduction, and Notes, by M. R. Cole. Memoirs of the 
American Folk-Lore Society. Boston : Houghton, MifiBin & Co. 



Mexico was lost, it was quite natural that the 
old play should continue to thrive within the 
separated area. That it is still played there 
after sixty years of " American " control, will 
only surprise those who are fond of assuming 
that our country has great assimilative power. 
Our editor says, " No inconsiderable part of the 
population of Texas is still Mexican in every- 
thing but name." Of course ! 

It is not quite clear, however, why the editor 
assumes the play to be of Mexican origin. It 
may or may not be. All Western Europe once 
delighted in religious plays. Nowhere were 
they more popular than in Spain ; nowhere 
were they so much used in propaganda ; no- 
where else did they occupy so large a share in 
the mind and thought of the people. Our editor 
justly remarks : " Long after public taste [else- 
where] had outgrown these primitive spectacles, 
sacred drama continued to develop in Spain, 
aided by the intense Catholicism of the country, 
and by the restraint to which secular drama was 
subjected. Lope de Vega lent the splendor of his 
genius to the autosacramental, while Calderon 
raised that form of symbolic drama to its high- 
est level, contributing to the national repertory 
more than seventy Corpus Christi plays." " Los 
Pastores " may have originated in Mexico, but 
it is quite as likely to have come from the 
mother-country. Through the vice-royalty, all 
that came from Spain was admired ; what was 
of local production was on the whole more or 
less despised. 

When the first missionaries entered Mexico 
they certainly brought autos with them. In 
this new world they found Indians already 
delighting in spectacular public performances, 
and they promptly introduced the sacred drama 
among their native converts. These were often 
given at a cost of labor and trouble and money 
that would be remarkable even at the present 
day. Motolinia's description of a Corpus Christi 
festival given in 1538 almost staggers belief. 

The editor of this volume has put a large 
amount of labor upon his task. A careful com- 
parison is made between the various versions 
accessible ; the metrical arrangement of the 
original is as nearly retained in the translation 
as is possible without the sacrifice of sense ; 
some passages can be traced back to Spanish 
nativities by Antonio del Castillo and Antonio 
Mira de Mescua, but the gi-eater part is still 
untraced. The rustic scenes of much of this 
untraced portion of the text influence the editor 
to refer the play as a whole to a Mexican rather 
than a Spanish source. As was to be expected.

the spelling of tlie text as given is full of errors 
and inconsistencies ; the number of actual Mexi- 
canisms in it, however, are few. While the 
translation is carefully done, there are some 
points of easy criticism. Andres is a pretty 
name, quite capable of direct transfer into 
English, and not beyond translation. Why it 
should be rendered by " Jim's Gabe " is a puz- 
zling question. But the work as a whole is too 
seriously and conscientiously done to warrant 
petty criticisms. 

The play of " Los Pastores " is probably a 
seventeenth century production. It varies in 
style " from doggerel to the distinction of good 
Spanish models . ' ' The actors are the Shepherds, 
the Hermit, Lucifer, and the Archangel Michael. 
The message of the Nativity is announced, 
producing varying effects upon the different 
actors. The shepherds seek the babe and render 
adoration to him. A combat takes place 
between Michael and Lucifer, in which the 
latter is finally subdued. The spirit of the 
play is on the whole good. There are fine 
passages, but there is also a good deal of coarse 
by-play. Most of the play is in versified mono- 
logue, but there are chorus-songs the airs of 
which are often pretty. Frederick Starr. 



Recent Fiction.* 



It is a pleasure to welcome Miss Robins among 
the novelists once more, after her recent disastrous 
excursion into controversial fiction. It is still farther 
a pleasure to find her again occupied with the theme 
which inspired " The Magnetic North," a book that 
had many constructive faults, but that largely made 
up for them by the vividness of its descriptive and 
dramatic passages. " Come and Find Me," which 
is also a story of Alaska (although it does not take 
us to that region until we are more than midway in 
the narrative), achieves its effects by force of im- 
aginative vision rather than by any observance of 
the rules of the novelist's game ; but the effects, when 
they are achieved, are undeniably striking. The 
climax, which holds us in breathless suspense while 
we are nearing it, and leaves our emotions wellnigh 
exhausted when it is done with, is made possible 
only by a defiance of what would seem to be an ele-

mentary principle of construction. We have every 
reason to expect that Jack Galbraith, who appears 
as a chubby infant in the opening chapters, is going 
to develop into the hero of the story, and he does, 
in a sense, but is kept away from tiie actual scene 
until the very end. We hear about him from time 
to time, and often expect him to appear in the flesh, 
but are disappointed again and again. Finally the 
heroine, who in search of her father has braved the 
horrors of the Cape Nome passage, and who has 
gone upon an expedition even farther northward, 
comes upon a lone hovel upon the desolate shore, 
and finds it occupied by an emaciated wreck of a 
man, stricken and starving, and an Eskimo dog in 
almost equally pitiable case. And this man is the 
Jack Galbraith whose thought has filled her mind 
during all the years between childhood and woman- 
hood, and this is their first meeting, and their last, 
since the early days. Here are all the materials 
needed for a memorable situation, but it is made 
even more memorable by the story he tells her in 
his dying hour. For he and the dog are the sole 
survivors of a party that had accomplished the 
crowning task of exploration, and had actually set 
foot upon the North Pole. He still has with him 
the precious evidence — maps, drawings, and scien- 
tific records — of the achievement, and then and 
there, having told the tale, the woman and the 
dying man commit them to the flames. This really 
tremendous scene will long linger in the memory, 
and it is made even the more impressive for having 
been so long deferred. The rest of the book has 
value chiefly in preparing us for this consummation, 
although it includes much that deserves praise on its 
own account. Particularly is this true of the story 
of the voyage to Nome, and the vivid portrayal of 
the improvised mining camp upon the Arctic beach. 
The whole story, rambling and incoherent beyond 
what is ordinarily permissible, is redeemed by the 
bits of reality, the choses vues, that it gives us, first 
at intervals, and afterwards in almost continuous 
succession. It is assuredly a story with a grip, 
from its wavering beginnings in Southern California 
to its firm handling of the scenes by Bering Sea. 

We are getting a little tired of the class of novels 
to which " Altars to Mammon " belongs, but this is 
not a bad example of its class. The wealthy capi- 
talist who grinds the faces of the poor and salves his 
conscience by building churches has been worked to 
death of late, and ought to be allowed a season of 
decent retirement. He doubtless exists here and 
there, but he is by no means typically representative 
of our captains of industry. In the present instance 
he is painted in the most glaring colors, and his 
misdeeds have made him an object of general exe- 
cration. He lives in a region not exactly described — 
somewhere in the mountain country of Maryland 
or West Virginia, — and his luxurious residence is 
effectively contrasted with the mean homes of his 
fellow citizens. He has a daughter, of course, who 
believes him to be the soul of goodness, and whose 
eyes it is the stern task of the novelist to open. This

she does through the agency of the hero, a young 
Methodist minister, who is given this district as his 
first charge. Full of zeal he enters upon his mission, 
and soon finds himself at swords' points with the 
moneyed interests of the region on the one hand, and 
with its ingrained religious bigotry on the other. 
During the months of stress and trial that follow, 
he g^ows sadly discouraged, but his spirit is not 
broken, and he gradually outgrows his own narrow- 
ness as he comes to realize that no religion that does 
not express itself in terms of social service can have 
any vital meaning. In time, his influence leavens 
the whole community, and the institutional worker 
takes the place of the preacher. Incidentally, he 
defeats the local magnate's political ambitions, and 
carries off the daughter in triumph. 

Miss Mary Imlay Taylor is a novelist whose work 
is always mannerly and pleasing, although it dis- 
plays no remarkable gift of either invention or 
characterization. It usually has a melodramatic 
tinge and a neatly contrived plot. Of late, it has 
taken to dealing with American life, and has thus 
come in closer touch with reality than when its 
scenes were laid in foreign countries. " The Reap- 
ing," Miss Taylor's newest book, is a novel of 
Washington society as it exists to-day, and has for its 
hero a brilliant congressman, in line for the highest 
political honors, who is confronted with the difficult 
problem of getting off with the old love and on with 
the new. The woman who has long held his affec- 
tions is married, but unhappily, and is impelled by 
her husband's misconduct and her own recklessness 
to seek a divorce. But her lover's feeling for her 
has by this time faded into a sentimental memory, 
and he has become seriously enthralled by the 
charms of a young girl whom he has recently come 
to know. This creates a perplexing situation for 
all three persons, for his sense of honor demands 
that he should offer his name to the woman who is 
freeing herself for his sake. The difficulty disap- 
pears with her death, as sudden as it is opportune 
for the novelist's purpose. There are some half a 
dozen lesser figures who are sketched for us natur- 
ally and with a fair degree of penetration, and the 
general atmosphere of the social life of the capital 
is interestingly and almost brilliantly reproduced. 

" The Measure of the Rule " is a novel by Mr. 
Robert Barr. What the title means is a mystery 
that we have not been able to fathom ; the story may 
be easily described by saying that it is in substance 
an account of a year spent by the hero as a student 
in the public normal school of a Western city. He 
has come from the farm, has been a country school 
teacher, and wishes to become a civil engineer. 
Reaching the metropolis, he finds it impossible to 
get the engineering training he wishes, and is per- 
suaded by a chance acquaintance to enter the normal 
school instead. From this time on we are entertained 
by accounts of his experiences with the faculty, of 
his boarding-house life, and of his surreptitious ac- 
quaintance with a girl whom he wooes with amazing 
yuntness. As a study of the educational conditions 



of such an institution as is described, the book has 
a puzzling interest for us. The methods, the rela- 
tions between teacher and students, the Draconian 
regulations, are utterly unlike anything we have ever 
known, and impress us as absolutely antediluvian. 
Yet they are given us in seemingly sober faith, and 
it is difficult to dispose of them as pure invention. 
Although the school is co-educational, a boy is not 
permitted to speak to a girl ; and to be seen with one 
in public, or to be discovered making a social call, 
is a crime for which ignominious expulsion is the 
only possible penalty. Our hero, of course, who 
could not otherwise be a hero of fiction, brazenly 
flouts these restrictive rules, is daring enough to 
accept a girl's invitation to call, and commits the 
crowning audacity of escorting her home from even- 
ing prayer-meeting. From the consequences of this 
escapade he escapes by the skin of his teeth. In 
the end, he marries her, although not without much 
intervening tribulation, and we leave him neither 
engineer nor teacher, but a rising artist in Paris, 
whose latest contribution to the Salon has been the 
success of the year. 

" Helpfulness and honesty seem to me the most 
essential characteristics of the American. . . . Con- 
sider the vividness of his religious emotion, his 
interest in religion and metaphysical science, — in 
short, look around everywhere without prejudice, 
and you cannot doubt that behind the terrifying 
mask of the selfish realist breathes the idealist, who 
is controlled by a belief in ethical values." These 
words of Professor Mtlnsterberg came to our atten- 
tion just as we were reading the latest productions 
of socialist fiction — Mr. Jack London's '' The Iron 
Heel " and Mr. Upton Sinclair's " The Metropolis " 
— and we could not help contrasting the sane and 
deliberate opinion of the foreign-born critic with the 
reckless sensationalism of our radical native novel- 
ists, for " helpfulness and honesty " are precisely the 
two traits which they deny us, — which, indeed, they 
are bound to deny us in order to find a basis for their 
lurid descriptions and their dismal vaticinations. To 
take Mr. Sinclair first, his book pretends to picture 
the social and business life of New York City, con- 
cerning which he has diligently informed himself by 
feeding on the highly seasoned fare daily provided 
by our most enterprising journalism. His method 
seems to be that of taking at face value the wildest 
imaginings of the inventive reporter, multiplying 
by some such number as ten, and piling up the 
product with cumulative effect. For the pm'pose of 
impressing us with the sinful extravagance of the 
predatory rich, he employs the simple expedient of 
setting down the price of everything mentioned, 
from a lace handkerchief to a steam yacht. By 
contrast with the warm color thus imparted to the 
pages, the yellowest of ordinary journalism seems to 
have no more than a sickly lemon hue. It would be 
ridiculous to take the book seriously as a social study, 
and it has not even the merit of being a good story. 
Even the possible romance that is hinted at now and 
then does not materialize, and we close the book with

the feeling that our time has been wasted upon a 
very dull tract. 

Mr. London's effusion is quite as dull a tract as 
the other ; it is mainly different because it prophesies 
an impossible future instead of depicting an unreal 
present. A story has been going around the news- 
papers to the effect that the author recently signed 
himself in some guest-book or other as " Yours for 
the revolution," and that a serious socialist whose 
name came next added the words, " There ain't 
going to be no revolution." Really, this is about 
all there is to say on the subject of '' The Iron 
Heel " considered as a thesis. Viewed as a product 
of the imagination, the book is also quite poverty- 
stricken. It describes the earlier stages of the 
revolution which the author sees coming, and con- 
siderately lets us know that the outbreak is only one 
lustrum distant from the present year of grace. By 
that time, the oligarchy will have got possession of 
pretty nearly everything capable of ownership, and 
the proletariat, rising in its might (and its greed) 
will begin the process of tjiking it all away. The 
conflict will be very "bluggy," and the author's 
imagination riots in its details. Various points of 
the story are enforced by choice footnote citations 
from our current literature of discontent. Of course, 
such books as this and the one previously discussed 
have a mischievous influence upon unbalanced minds, 
and we cannot but deplore their multiplication. No 
period of social unrest was ever more in need than 
the present of temperate discussion of the questions 
that our rapid material growth has forced upon all 
men's minds. Conciliation rather than strife, soft- 
ness rather than bitterness of speech, should be the 
aims of all who really wish to help our civilization 
through the stressful years now at hand. And our 
civilization has no worse enemies than those who are 
engaged in the truly devilish work of fomenting 
social dissension and arraying class against class. 
It is for this reason, far more than because of their 
slovenly neglect of the principles of literary work- 
manship, that we think the two books now under 
review deserving of the severest condemnation.

studies of 



Mr. Christian Brinton does not state 

modern painters.^^J^}'f^y anywhere in his studies of 
" Modern Artists " ( Baker & Taylor 
Co.) what constitutes his idea of modernity and 
thereby his basis of selection. But in general his test 
seems to be virility of insight and workmanship, 
a compelling personality, above all the power to 
paint realities, whether ideal realities like Watts, 
rococo realities like Fragonard, or the stern reality 
of toil like Meunier and Segantini. Of the fourteen 
artists discussed all are painters ; eleven are still 
living or have died within the present century ; and 
all are figure painters, not a single landscape being 



reproduced among the sixty full-page illustrations. 
These facts cast a little more light on Mr. Brinton's 
conception of the modern note in art. However, it 
is not fair to theorize too much about his choices, 
for he states distinctly that he is not writing to up- 
hold any particular thesis, but is merely criticizing — 
or, to speak more accurately, characterizing — the 
work of each artist independently, trying to give a 
sense of each man's individuality and of the environ- 
ment that moulded his work. Mr. Brinton is thus 
able to approach each painter with open mind and 
ready sympathy. His criticism is interesting in that 
it seizes so readily upon salient features and phrases 
its conclusions so forcibly. Meunier is the apostle 
of democracy ; Whistler, on the other hand, typifies 
the inevitable reaction — " the principle of aristoc- 
racy reasserting itself." Lenbach is " the rigorous 
analyst to whom beauty of colour was naught and 
character was everything," while Sargent is "in no 
sense a painter of thought, or of feelings other than 
those which are plainly etched upon the human 
countenance," his whole interest being in texture, 
form, and shape, — in the glorification of rich and 
beautiful externals. Such characterizations are dan- 
gerous of course ; they thrust forward one mood 
or one set of qualities and ignore others equally 
necessary to an exact delineation ; but being always 
crisply stated and copiously illustrated by plates, 
whose generous number and fine quality are a telling 
feature of Mr. Brinton's book, these trenchant, deci- 
sive judgments will appeal particularly to the novice 
in art-study. It is for such readers, who are interested 
in interpretative rather than in technical criticism, 
that " Modern Artists " is intended. Among popular 
art books this has the further distinction of discussing 
several artists — such as Wiertz, the mad Belgian 
painter, Arnold BOcklin, Rdpin, and Zuloaga — 
whose work is likely to be new to many readers, and 
yet is of decided interest. The emphasis on portrait- 
ure is also unusual in books of this class. 



Bonapartisni 
and French 
liberalism. 



The historical importance which Mr. 
H. A. L. Fisher, in his essays on 
" Bonapartism " (Oxford Clarendon 
Press), attributes to Napoleon's conversations at 
St. Helena, raises questions of great interest. He 
believes that Napoleon felt the need of harmonizing 
his life with the " requirements of French liberal- 
ism," and, to this end, spoke of himself as the 
representative of the ideas of 1789. This conten- 
tion Napoleon sought to substantiate by dictating, in 
1820, a constitution for the hypothetical reign of 
Napoleon II., which should include liberties never 
conceded by him — liberty of the press, freedom 
from administrative tyranny, and parliamentary 
control. He argued that the Empire had always 
meant peace, although in the search for a firm basis 
of peace he had continually been baffled by the 
English. In the single essay where this matter is 
discussed, Mr. Fisher has not given himself room 
enough to offer adequate evidence of the influence 
of these conversations upon the public opinion of 



248 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



France. He mentions merely the fact that the 
jom-nalist Armand Carrel was persuaded by them 
that Napoleon was a liberal. He appears also to 
believe that Louis Napoleon's book on " Napoleonic 
Ideas," published in 1839, had some influence in 
propagating the legend. In a later lecture on the 
downfall of the Second Empire, he remarks that 
Napoleon III., in making the concessions which 
opened the way for the Liberal Empire, was moved, 
partly at least, by the feeling that he must be con- 
sistent with what he had set forth as the Napoleonic 
system. The other lectures in the volume, covering 
the important phases of the subject to the final ruin 
of Bonapartism in 1870, are vigorous and suggestive 
in grasp of matter and style of treatment. This is 
especially true of the first, which shows wherein the 
Revolutionary movement was simply a persistence 
of political habits formed under the Old Regime, 
and how these tendencies smoothed the road of the 
master. But Mr. Fisher is mistaken in the view 
that even the early assemblies contented themselves 
TV^ith fixing the general principles of a legislative 
measure, leaving to the executive the duty of pro- 
viding detailed regulations for their application. 
One looks through the columns of Duvergier in vain 
for evidence of this practice, and discovers, on the 
contrary, that the Constituent assembly, for example, 
was constantly encroaching upon executive functions, 
instead of abandoning any of its proper work to the 
executive. 

The arousing ^n experienced Orientalist and a 
of the Hermit professional psychologist, Dr. George 
Kingdom. Trumbull Ladd, has brought to the 

study of the Korean people and Korean problems an 
equipment possessed by no preceding visitor to the 
Hermit Kingdom. His book, " In Korea with 
Marquis Ito " (Scribner) is of course, from its very 
title, written rather from the Japanese than from the 
native or the Chinese point of view ; but one cannot 
turn its pages without being impressed by its pains- 
taking endeavor to be impartial and truthful in 
every particular. It has long been more than sus- 
pected that the press reports of Japanese high- 
handedness in Korea were greatly exaggerated. 
Marquis Ito, Resident-General, finding his adminis- 
tration greatly hampered and sadly misjudged in 
consequence of these sensational reports that only 
reached him, tardily, by way of England or America, 
invited Professor Ladd, in the course of a lecture 
tour in Japan a year ago, to spend some time at 
Seoul as his guest and to aid him in correcting the 
false impressions made on the public ; and also the 
American visitor was to exert his influence, in 
whatever way he might choose, toward promoting 
more cordial relations between the protected and 
the protecting country, and toward " furthering for 
the Koreans themselves the benefits which the exist- 
ing relations of the two countries made it desirable 
for both to secure." In the almost five hundred 
pages of the book, a full account of Dr. Ladd's 
experiences, and a sufiiciently minute description of 



persons and places not always of savory sweetness, 
are faithfully given. There is also an excursion 
into the domain of history, and another into the 
field of prophecy. A glimpse at least of the Korean 
problem is furnished by the following passage from 
the closing chapter : " The future of Korea and of 
the Japanese Protectorate over Korea will inevitably 
depend upon the action and reaction of three classes 
of factors. These are the attitude and behavior of 
other foreign nations ; the native capacity for self- 
government and the actual conduct of the Koreans 
themselves ; and the policy of Japan, not as a theory 
or an experiment merely, but as embodied in indus- 
tries, laws, institutions and other forms of practical 
effect." The volume is well illustrated, and is in 
every respect a valuable work of its kind. 



The areat ^^^ great earthquake of April, 1906, 

California which initiated such destruction in 

earthquake. ^^ gj^y ^f gg^^^ Francisco and the 

adjoining regions, called forth a great variety of 
scientific and descriptive writing. President Jordan, 
of Stanford University, has edited a volume con- 
taining a collection of eight essays, which appears 
with the title " The California Earthquake of 1906 " 
(A. M. Robertson, San Francisco). With one excep- 
tion the essays have been printed previously, chiefly 
in scientific journals ; but while written from the 
scientific point of view, they are invested with a 
good degree of popular interest. Three of the writers 
are members of the faculty of Stanford University, 
and one is of the University of California. Dr. Omori, 
a member of the Imperial Earthquake Investigation 
Committee of Japan, and the inventor of a widely- 
used type of earthquake recorder, writes on the cause 
of the earthquake. Professor Derleth, of the Uni- 
versity of California, occupies one-third of the book 
in describing the effects of the earth-movements upon 
structures of various types, and draws some practi- 
cal conclusions as to the safest ways of building for 
the future. The chief article, from the standpoint 
of geology, is written by Professor Gilbert of the 
U. S. Geological Survey ; five of the other articles 
are primarily geological in aspect, but distinctly pop- 
ular in treatment. The concluding essay is by Mrs. 
Mary Austin, an accomplished magazine writer, who 
was one of the San Francisco victims, and describes 
the human side of the catastrophe in a graphic and 
picturesque way. The book is illustrated by a hun- 
dred and twenty -five half-tone plates from photo- 
graphs showing the scenes of the great disaster.

much that calls for unqualified condemnation, much 
that would almost lead a genuine lover of the theatre 
to despair of its intellectual elevation. We must all 
admit that the theatre has become commercialized 
as fully as any other business enterprise, and that 
the financially profitable but artistically ruinous 
system of " long runs " contrasts unfavorably with 
the more prevalent repertory of the Italian theatres. 
The censor, to the Italian critic, is an unmitigated 
evil, since the Anglo-Saxon conscience will have 
none of the plays that may show genius but not 
morals. The worst evil of all, however, is the great 
British public, " artless, coarse-minded, dull-witted," 
whose taste has to be pandered to in order that the 
play may have a run. Yet there are encouraging 
features even on the English stage. The work of 
Jones, Barrie, Pinero, and Shaw shows a marked 
advance over the rampant dulness of the mid- 
Victorian period. The achievements of the Stage 
Society and of the Court Theatre, which aim at the 
production of intellectual plays regardless of their 
commercial value, indicate that there is a strong 
working minority with ideals and enthusiasm. 
Corresponding to this intellectual minority, there 
are in Ireland the founders of the Irish National 
Theatre, of whom Mr. W. B. Yeats is chief, who are 
trying with some success to rehabilitate the " dim 
kingdom of the unreal " in the Celtic past. Indeed, 
the great British public has always been logically 
doomed by its Continental critics to produce a dull 
and heavy literature, and yet it has somehow man- 
aged to create a literature which is the despair of 
these same critics. The cause is not yet lost. 

For teachers Professor Stanley Hall's important 
and parents of work on Adolescence, an epoch- 
adolescent youth, marking if not epoch-making book 
(reviewed at length in The Dial of August 16, 
1904), has been condensed and epitomized by the 
author into a single volume which appears with the 
new title " Youth, its Education, Regimen, and 
Hygiene" (Appleton). It is remarkable how large 
a proportion of the practically valuable matter of 
the two large volumes has been packed into the 
small one. Indeed, most teachers and parents 
would do better to read the smaller than the larger 
work ; in the latter the uninitiated reader easily loses 
his orientation, and is confused and misled by the 
mass of pathological material. Some of the most 
important chapters are those on the Motor Powers ; 
Plays, Sports, and Games ; Faults, Lies, and Crimes ; 
The Growth of Social Ideals ; and finally that great 
declaration of revolt. Intellectual Education and 
School Work. It would have been well if some 
parts of the chapter on Sex Development in the 
original work had been adapted and included in the 
shorter volume; few topics stand more in need of 
wise and trustworthy popularization. It is to be re- 
gretted that the work was done so much with scissors. 
President Hall's extraordinary learning and wealth 
of ideas and expression amount to an actual obstacle 
in many places in the original work, to all except the 



expert ; the shorter book is avowedly for the use of a 
larger public, and yet little has been done to adapt 
the style and form to this public, beyond the inser- 
tion of very mechanical foot-notes, sometimes almost 
naive in their information, and of a glossary like- 
wise mechanical and not well chosen. The constant 
occurrence of rare and ultra-technical words — in 
not a few cases apparently the creation of the 
author's scientific imagination and linguistic knowl- 
edge — and of long and involved sentences, is a 
serious defect in the work. Nevertheless, it is a 
world-classic on its subject, and should be read by 
everyone concerned with the education of youth, 
especially by high-school teachers and the parents of 
adolescent children. 



An English ^^^ point of view of the new English 

biography biographer of Abraham Lincoln, Mr. 

of Lincoln. Henry Bryan Binns, is shown by the 

quotation from Whitman on his title-page, — " The 
grandest figure yet on all the crowded canvas of the 
nineteenth century." Mr. Binns has done an excel- 
lent piece of biographical work, having written one 
of the best-balanced and sanest of the innumerable 
lives of Lincoln. There is evident advantage in his 
detachment from national and partisan considera- 
tions ; he has been able to view the discussions and 
strifes of the antebellum period, and the vexed 
questions and stirring events of the Civil War, apart 
from the prejudices derived from the uncritical 
reading and study that largely shape the opinions 
of every American youth. The result is a biography 
of moderate compass that represents what in the 
main must be the final summing up of the man and 
his work in the annals of the world, the judgment 
of posterity upon " the greatest of the popular states- 
men of the last century, the most notable among the 
leaders of the English-speaking democracy." Mr. 
Binns has not attempted to hide the earlier unlovely 
phases of Lincoln's life, but has traced his develop- 
ment out of them into the highest range of states- 
manship and character. The book is one of the 
"Temple Biographies," published in London by 
Dent and in this country by E. P. Dutton & Co.

well known in the biological world. The work is 
without a rival in any language, and is unsurpassed 
as a complete and comprehensive compendium of 
the more significant facts of comparative anatomy, 
an indispensable text for college and university use, 
and a valuable work of reference in the general 
library. The illustrations are very numerous and 
excellent, though not always executed with the 
perfection found in the German original. This is 
especially noticeable in the case of those cuts in 
which color-printing has been employed. The size 
of the page has been somewhat reduced, resulting in 
a more convenient volume for the library shelf, but 
crowding the margins beyond the limits of good 
taste in book-making. The translation includes an 
extensive bibliography of the subject, covering sixty- 
eight closely set pages ; but even this contains only 
the titles of the more prominent papers, and by no 
means all of these. It is doubtless an oversight that 
the " American Journal of Anatomy " is omitted 
from its proper place in these lists. 

Knowledge of ^^t every college professor is so for- 
the toiar system tunate as to have his class lectures

excellently illustrated volume, even after suitable 
revision to adapt them to a wider reading public. 
This has happened to Dr. C. L. Poor, of Columbia 
University, whose book on " The Solar System " 
now fills a niche in Putnam's notable " Science 
Series." The work contains a solid substratum of 
such historical matter regarding the sun and his 
family of attendant planets as one is accustomed to 
find in any well-ordered text-book on astronomy. 
To this the author has added the results of a wide 
reading of the latest researches, so that his treatment 
of his subject is brought well down to date. A 
special chapter is given to a popular explanation of 
the ever-puzzling subject of the tides, together with 
a brief account of Prof. George H. Darwin's theory 
of tidal evolution ; but the author is not blind to the 
fact that many things are likely to happen which 
will keep this evolutionary process from bearing its 
full fruitage. As the planet Mars just now occupies 
the centre of the astronomical stage, Dr. Poor has 
devoted two chapters to it, the second one being a 
fair-minded though rather destructive criticism of 
the latest theories concerning the existence of sen- 
tient life upon its ruddy face. Most practical 
astronomers will agree with the statement (page 
231) that "very little is actually known in regard 
to the conditions existing on Mars." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. A. S. E. Ackermann has prepared and the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. has published a useful and amusing vol- 
ume entitled " Popular Fallacies." In it many of man's 
pet beliefs and theories are subjected to searching 
scientific analysis and proved to be either carelessly 
mis-stated or utterly false. The fallacies disproved are 
of the most miscellaneous character. We are shown that 



we must no longer believe that a thick tumbler stands 
hot water better than a thin one, that the color of gpreen 
tea is produced by drying the leaves on a copper tray, 
that falling stars are stars falling, that London cab- 
fares are doubled after midnight, or that turning the 
hands of a watch backwards damages it. As the author 
suggests in his preface, none of his readers can be guilty 
of believing all the fallacies in the book, and on the 
other hand no one will fail to find there some of his pet 
delusions. 

"Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation" has 
just been added to the " Original Narratives of Early 
American History" published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. It is the sixth volume in that invalu- 
able collection of reprints, and has been edited by the 
late William T. Davis, of Plymouth, who died a few 
months ago at the age of eighty-five, having nearly 
completed the task of seeing the book through the 
press. " Winthrop's Journal," in two volumes, is also 
soon to appear in this series. 

It seems curious, considering the prestige of Vasari's 
"Lives of the Painters," that the technical Introduction 
to the " Lives " should have escaped translation into 
English until now. Miss Louisa S. Maclehose is respon- 
sible for the first English version, for which Professor 
G. Baldwin Brown furnishes notes and an interesting 
preface. The volume, which is a thick octavo, lavishly 
illustrated, is published by Messrs. Dutton & Co. 
under the title " Vasari on Technique." Vasari's text, 
which is divided into three parts, headed respectively 
Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, consists in large 
part of practical directions about artistic materials and 
processes, intended for the enlightenment of both the 
craftsman and the lay reader. 

A text-book of "Physiography for High Schools," 
by Professor RoUin D. Salisbury, is published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. in the " American Science Series." 
Professor Freeman used to say that the way to write a 
small book was to begin with a large book upon the 
same subject, and the opinion was undoubtedly sound. 
Professor Salisbury has thus qualified in the present 
instance by his share in the great three-volume 
"Geology" of Messrs. Chamberlin and Salisbury, as 
well as by his own large " Physiography." Not that the 
present volume is a very small one, but only in compar- 
ison with its huge predecessors. It seems to us to be a 
very good book indeed, admirably fitted to the needs of 
advanced students in high schools, and richly illustrated 
in the most attractive manner. 

Mr. Ernest H. Short's "History of Sculpture" 
(Dutton) is avowedly written for a purpose. Mr. 
Short believes that true art is always the expression 
and interpretation of national life, the individual artist 
being " no more than the crest of a wave in the sea of 
mental, emotional, and physical energy whence art 
arises." As a backgroimd for an intelligent imder- 
standing of the sculpture of any age one must have, 
then, an idea of its temper and tendencies. Such 
conceptions Mr. Short endeavors to supply in brief 
historical summaries and characterizations; and by thus 
showing that beautiful marbles and bronzes have a 
vital relation to life, he hopes to arouse an interest in 
sculpture as a living art. His book covers the entire 
ground from the rise of the sculptor's art in Greece 
through the work of the French and British schools of 
the nineteenth century. Few biographical data are 
given, and attention is paid only to the most character- 
istic works of each artist.

Notes. 



" Justice to the Jew," by the Rev. Madison C. Peters, 
is published in a new and revised edition by the McClure 
Co., the original edition having appeared nine years ago. 

A second edition of the Rev. Francis Aidon Gasquet's 
" The Black Death," an important work which has for 
some years been out of print, is now published by The 
Macmillan Co. 

"The Tempest," "The Winter's Tale," and "Othello" 
are three new volimaea in the " First Folio " Shakespeare, 
edited by the Misses Porter and Clarke, and published 
by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburg has issued a very 
useful catalogue of books suitable for the reading of 
children in our elementary schools. They are classified 
by grades, and still further classified by subject under 
each grade. The titles are briefly annotated, and there 
is a complete index of authors and titles. 

Mr. Clement K. Shorter is authority for the state- 
ment that the author of " Confessio Medici," published 
anonymously, is Dr. Stephen Paget, author of "Our 
Yoimg People." Dr. Paget is a distinguished London 
physician and a son of the famous Sir James Paget, 
surgeon to Queen Victoria and King Edward. 

Goya is the subject of the latest volume in Mr. 
Albert F. Calvert's " Spanish Series " of picture-books. 
Over six himdred examples of the artist's work are given 
in the illustrative half of the volume. These supple- 
ment the two hundred pages of text in a comprehensive 
way. The series is published by the John Lane Co. 

A recent addition to the famous " Tauchnitz " library 
which is of special interest on this side of the water, is 
" A Manual of American Literature," the work of the 
professors of the English department at Cornell, under 
the editorial supervision of Mr. Theodore Stanton. 
Messrs. Putnam's Sons will publish the volume in this 
country. 

Mr. Thomas B. Mosher has chosen "The Hound of 
Heaven," possibly the late Francis Thompson's most 
beautiful poem, for Spring publication in the unique 
style characteristic of his press. The edition, which is 
limited, is printed on Van Gelder paper, and may be 
had in paper, boards, or vellum binding. Mr. Mosher 
contributes an appreciative note to the edition. 

The fourth publication of the Club for Colonial 
Reprints, of Providence, R. I., will appear this month. 
It consists of a reprint in facsimile from the original 
edition published in Philadelphia in 1772 of the "Invi- 
tation Serieuse aux Habitants des Illinois, by Un 
Habitant des Kaskaskias." Messrs. C. W. Alvord and 
C. E. Carter, of the University of Illinois, have edited 
the publication. 

A volume of " Stories of Wagner Operas Told for 
Children," by Miss Elizabeth M. Wheelock, is pub- 
lished by the Bobbs-Merrill Co. Seven of the eleven 
music-dramas are put into simple narrative form, and the 
book is assuredly a contribution to the every-child-should- 
know literature of which we get so many examples 
nowadays. A fluffier swan than was ever seen upon 
any stage prettily decorates the cover. 

An innovation in cataloguing that will commend itself 
to students and readers in special fields has recently 
been made by The Macmillan Company. This consists 
in a series of Check Lists, each list containing a com- 
plete enumeration of books published by this firm on a 
given subject. Owing to the large number of books 



published by the company in certain special fields, 
many of these lists comprise important sections of the 
bibliographies of their particular subjects. They are so 
compact as to be much more convenient for ordinary 
use than the large general catalogue. We understand 
that these lists are supplied without charge. 

" Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century," edited 
by Dr. J. E. Spingarn, adjunct professor of Comparative 
Literature in Columbia University, New York, is an- 
nounced by the Oxford University Press. The aim of 
this work, which will be in three volumes, is to collect 
all the material (save the writings of Dryden) necessary 
for a thorough study of the development of English crit- 
icism in the seventeenth century, and to make this devel- 
opment more intelligible by annotation and comment. 

The fourth annual meeting of the American Political 
Science Association was held at Madison during the 
Christmas holidays of last year, and the Proceedings 
are now published by the Waverly Press, Baltimore. 
Six groups of papers are included, having for their 
respective subjects the Latin American republics. Colo- 
nial government, the making and revision of law, the 
newer institutional forms of democracy, the administra- 
tion of punitive justice, and public service commissions. 

Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have added four volumes 
to their series of popular-priced reprints of recent copy- 
righted fiction : " Sappho," by Alphonse Daudet, trans- 
lated by George Burnham Ives ; A. B. Ward's " The 
Sage Bmsh Parson"; "Mistress Brent," by Lucy 
Meacham Thruston ; and " By the Good Sainte Anne," 
by Anna Chapin Ray. Print, paper, and binding are all 
of good quality, and the series will appeal to readers 
who are willing to save money by waiting a little for 
their new novels. 

What will doubtless prove one of the most important 
publications of the coming Fall is a biography of the 
late Richard Mansfield, now being prepared by Mr. Paul 
Wilstach. Mr. Wilstach was for ten years associated 
with Mr. Mansfield's management and was his intimate 
friend. In preparing the book he has had the coopera- 
tion of Mrs. Mansfield, who has put at his disposal all 
her husband's papers and correspondence. Portions of 
the work will appear serially in " Scribner's Magazine " 
before its publication in book form. 

As new volumes come to us in the " Shakespeare 
Library " of Messrs. Duffield & Co., we are consider- 
ably impressed by the magnitude and scope of this 
new publishing enterprise. Just now we have at hand 
four new volumes in the " old-spelling " section of 
the series, giving us " A Midsommer Nights Dreame," 
" The Comedie of Errors," " Twelfe Night," and " The 
Two Gentlemen of Verona." Mr. F. J. Furnivall edits 
the first of the four, and Mr. W. G. Boswell-Stoue the 
remaining three. Another volume of the Library gives 
us Brooke's " Romeus and Juliet," edited by Mr. J. J. 
Mmiro, and still another adds " A Midsummer Night's 
Dream " to the section entitled " The Lamb Shakespeare 
for the Young." 

Mr. J. Logic Robertson has edited " The Complete 
Poetical Works of Thomas Campbell," and the result 
is a single handsome volume published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde in his " Oxford " series of English poets. Mr. 
Robertson's opinion of Campbell is expressed by record- 
ing " a feeling of surprise and indignation that he is at 
present so much neglected," and " the conviction that a 
later generation will do more honour to his memory 
than we have done." This denotes the right sort of

editorial equipment, provided enthusiasm does not go 
far enough to destroy the balance of judgment. The 
" later generation " of which the editor speaks will not 
be likely to read extensively either "The Pleasures of 
Hope " or " Gertrude of Wyoming," but it will make a 
great mistake if it forgets some of the;|patriotic songs 
and ballads. 

Four contributions from American writers appear in 
the April issue of "The Hibbert Journal." One of 
these, " The Dualism of St. Augustine," is by Mr. Paul 
E. More, the literary editor of the New York " Nation." 
Another is entitled " Religious Transition and Ethical 
Awakening in America," by Professor Arthur O. 
Lovejoy, at present lecturer in philosophy at Columbia 
University. A third is from the pen of Professor Frank 
Thilly, of Cornell University, and deals with "The 
World View of a Poet: Goethe's Philosophy." The 
last is " British Exponents of Pragmatism," by Dr. E. B. 
M'Gilvary, Professor of Philosophy in the University of 
Wisconsin. Messrs. Sherman, French & Co. of Boston 
are now the authorized agents of " The Hibbert Journal " 
in this country. 

It will be good news to students of political economy, 
who are not college graduates, that the bars have been 
let down this year in the Hart, Schaffner & Marx com- 
petition for the best essays on economics. Heretofore 
the prizes have been restricted to those possessing a 
college degree. This year that restriction is removed, 
and now men and women who have not had university 
advantages may compete. Moreover, since most of 
them would feel at a disadvantage in such a contest, 
another and special contest for them alone has been 
instituted. They may have their choice. The trustees 
also announce that the contestants are not limited to 
the subjects suggested, though any other subject chosen 
must first be approved by the board as worth while. 
The first prizes in the three classes are $600, $300, 
and $500. Professor J. Laurence Laughlin of the 
University of Chicago is the Chairman of the committee 
which has charge of the competition. All essays which 
are awarded prizes are subsequently brought out in book 
form, five already having been published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Company announce the 
forthcoming incorporation of their firm under the laws 
of Massachusetts and under the name of Houghton 
Mifflin Company, for the continuation of the business of 
manufacturiug and publishing books, founded by Henry 
Oscar Houghton more than fifty years ago. This will 
involve no change in the management or conduct of the 
business, the present partners retaining their full interest 
and active participation. Mr. James Duncan Phillips, 
Mr. Stephen B. Davol, Mr. Roger L. Scaif e, Mr. Edward 
R. Houghton, and Mr. George Harrison Mifflin, Jr., 
who have been actively associated with the business for 
several years, will be members of the new corporation; 
the two first named being managers of the Educational 
Department. " The Atlantic Monthly," which has been 
published by the house since 1873, will hereafter, begin- 
ning with the August number, be published by The 
Atlantic Monthly Company, of which Mr. EUery Sedg- 
wick, Mr. Waldo E. Forbes, Mr. MacGregor Jenkins, 
and Mr. Roger Pierce will be members, Houghton 
Mifflin Company retaining an important interest. No 
change in the character or general conduct of the mag- 
azine is contemplated. Mr. Bliss Perry continues as 
editor, and the magazine will still be printed at The 
Riverside Press, and issued from 4 Park Street, Boston.

Economic Prizes 



FIFTH YEAR 

In order to arouse an interest in the study of topics relating to commerce and industry, and to 
stimulate those who have a college training to consider the problems of a business career, a committee 
composed of 

Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, University of Chicago, Chairman; 
Professor J. B. Clark, Columbia University; 
Professor Henry C. Adams, University of Michigan; 
Horace White, Esq., New York City, and 
* Hon. Carroll. D. Wright, Clark College, 

have been enabled, through the generosity of Messrs. Hart, Schaffner & Marx, of Chicago, to offer in 1909 
prizes under two general heads. Attention is expressly called to a new rule that a competitor is not 
confined to subjects mentioned in this announcement; but any other subject chosen must first be approved 
by the Committee. 

I. Under the first head are suggested herewith a few subjects intended primarily for 
those who have had an academic training ; but the possession of a degree is not required 
of any contestant, nor is any age limit set. 

1. German and American methods of regulating trusts. 

2. The logic of " Progress and Poverty." 

3. What are the ultimate ends of trade-unions, and can these be gained by any application of the 

principles of monopoly ? 

4. In view of the existing railway progress, should the United States encourage the construction of 

waterways ? 

5. Is it to be expected that the present and recent production of gold will cause a higher level of prices? 
Under this head. Class A includes any American without restriction; and Class B includes only 

those who, at the time the papers are sent in, are undergraduates of any American college. Any member 
of Class B may compete for the prizes of Class A. 

A First Prize of Six Hundred Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Four Hundred Dollars 

are offered for the best studies presented by Class A, and 

A First Prize of Three Hundred Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Two Hundred Dollars 

are offered for the best studies presented by Class B. The conamittee reserves to itself the right to 
award the two prizes of $600 and $400 of Class A to undergraduates in Class B, if the merits of the 
papers demand it. 

II. Under the second head are suggested some subjects intended for those who may 
not have had academic training, and who form Class C. 

1. The best scheme for uniform corporation accounts. 

2. Desirable methods of improving our trade with China. 

3. The proper spheres of the trust company and the commercial bank. 

4. The relations of oriental immigration to American industries. 

5. The relative efficiency of American and European labor in manufacturing industries. 

One Prize of Five Hundred Dollars 

js offered for the best study presented by Class C ; but any member of Class C may compete in Class A. 

The ownership of the copyright of successful studies will vest in the donors, and it is expected that, without pre- 
cluding the use of these papers as theses for higher degrees, they will cause them to be issued in some permanent form. 

Competitors are advised that the studies should be thorough, expressed in good English, and although not limited 
as to length, they should not be needlessly expanded. They should be inscribed with an assumed name, the class in which 
they are presented, and accompanied by a sealed envelope giving the real name and address of the competitor. If the 
competitor is in Class B, the sealed envelope should contain the name of the institution in which he is studying. The 
papers should be sent on or before June 1, 1909, to 

J. Laurence Laughlin, Esq.

'' THE RETURN OF THE ESSAY ''

Publishers' readers, if good, seldom indulge in prophecies, and are seldom surprised at anything that happens. So it

poetic records of country life which have made some authors famous." 12mo. $1.25 net.*

" If any writer of the present era is read a half century hence, a quarter cen- 
tury, or even a decade, that writer is William De Morgan."— Boston Transcript. 

De Morgan's SOMEHOW GOOD $175 

A story of London to-day concerning two women and a returned wanderer, who lost his memory, which illustrates 

Tennyson's " Oh yet we trust that somehow good 

Will be the final goal of ill." 

Dial — " A higher quality of enjoyment than is derivable from the work of any other novelist now living and active in 
either England or America. Absolutely masterly. The plot is extremely ingenious and complicated." 

H. W. Boynton in the Bookman (which lists it among the six best selling books in America)—" A giant in the market- 
place. . . . Intense human sympathy. . . . Simply and beautifully the action develops in that aura of rich humor which casts 
its glow over all human life as Mr. De Morgan sees it." 

Nation — " A book as sound, as sweet, as wholesome, as wise, as any in the range of fiction." 

Independent — " Every page is as interesting as the last, and would be read with pleasure even if torn out of the book 
and caught fluttering down the street." 

New York Times Review — "If you love your Thackeray, you may chance it safely enough — and have your reward." 

De Morgan's ALrCE-FOR-SHORT $175 

How the long-buried past reappeared in Nineteenth Century London. A very human often humorous story, in which 

however there are bewildering ghosts. 

Dial — "A remarkable example of the art of fiction at its noblest." 

De Morgan's JOSEPH VANCE $i75 

A love story of later life near London in the 50' s. 

New York Times Review — " The first great English novel that has appeared in the Twentieth Century." 



A novel, which the Chicago Record-Herald says is " strong, original, and full of 
promise," by HARRISON RHODES, sometime editor of "The Chap Book" 

THE FLIGHT TO EDEN 

The story opens in and near London, about 1870. Basil Forrester, through tragic experience, comes to feel that his 

love can only bring sorrow or death to women, and flies to the east coast of Florida. Although he finds an Eve there, 

this is not the Eden of the title, for he finds there also the menace of violent death, a rude chivalry — and the shadow 

of London. $1.50. 

Chicago Tribune — " A tenderly pathetic romance . . . vivid descriptions of a part of the United States little known, 
and the dramatic situations are handled well." 

Chicago Evening Post— " Excellent work of fiction ... on unusual lines . . . with equal artistic feeling and a virile 
touch puts very real people into the foreground. The women are all drawn with a tenderness that is sometimes exquisite." 

The Bookman — " There is a grim intensity about the initial tragedy that grips the attention at once ; . • • the idyllic 
charm of the Florida episodes. . . . There is no question that Mr. Rhodes knows how to portray people and incidents in a 
way that forces you to see them." 

Boston Transcript — " Exceptionally vivid descriptions give atmosphere to a significant plot.''

THi: IRONY OF AMEBIC A. 



Foreign critics of American life are often 
instructive, and usually amusing : the extent to 
which they exhibit both of these qualities is 
happily exemplified in the series of articles now 
being written from month to month for " The 
Chautauquan " by Mr. John Graham Brooks. 
The writer has made a diligent study of Euro- 
pean comment upon America, from the old days 
of " a certain condescension " to the modern days 
of gasping bewilderment and fantastic depiction, 
and in a collection of characteristic passages, skil- 
fully chosen and grouped, has given us a com- 
posite panorama of foreign opinion which is 
worthy of our most serious attention. No other 
of our current magazines is at present doing any- 
thing quite so interesting as this ; the special 
merits of the work being its candor, its will- 
ingness to accept legitimate criticism without 
resentment, and its broadly philosophical out- 
look. Most writers who report upon the views 
of foreigners concerning our life are actuated by 
the motive of national self -laudation, more or less 
concealed ; they either reproduce words of praise, 
that we may swell with pride when we read them, 
or they repeat the condemnation of the censori- 
ous, that the reaction from ruffled sensibilities 
may heighten our sense of self-esteem. Mr. 
Brooks does nothing of this sort. He is con- 
cerned only with the truth, and is objective 
enough to accept it, even when it is presented 
in unpalatable shape. 

It is only in passing, however, that we men- 
tion this series of contributions to our self- 
knowledge gained by reflection from the con- 
sciousness of outsiders. Our special text is 
found in what a recent English visitor, Mr. 
Charles Whibley, has to say about American 
literature in the pages of " Blackwood's Maga- 
zine." The text runs as follows : " This, then, 
is the irony of America, that the country which 
has a natural dislike of the past still dances 
to the ancient tunes, that the country which has 
invented so much has not invented a new method 
of expression, that the country which questions 
aU things accepts its literature in simple faith." 
Now this proposition, with the concomitant one 
that " from the first the writers of America have 
lagged honorably behind their age," is substan- 
tially true, although it may be expressed in ways 



262 



THE DIAL. 



[Mayl, 



either pleasing or offensive, according to one's 
prejudice. Mr. Swinburne, for example, ex- 
pressed it offensively when he said that our 
poets were either mocking-birds or corn-crakes, 
either imitative or unmelodious. Mr. Whibley 
does not express it offensively, but sees in it 
only a curious conservatism. He doubtless got 
the idea from Mr. Barrett Wendell, who may 
be said to have patented it, and the obligation 
might suitably have been recognized. 

The author takes Emerson, Poe, and Parkman 
as typical illustrations of his thesis. Emerson 
was in theory " an anarch who flouted the con- 
ventions of art and life." But when he took 
pen in hand " he instantly became the slave of 
all the periods which he despised." It was Poe 
" who most eloquently preached the gospel of 
style," and his was necessarily the style that 
had been shaped by centuries of English tradi- 
tion. Parkman wrote of American Indians in 
the language of English classicism, and such a 
phrase as " the pampered Sardanapalus of 
Versailles" he evidently gets straight from 
Gibbon. Mr. Howells and Mr. James, though 
their material be new, are "links in the central 
chain of our tradition, and in speech, if not in 
thought, are sternly conservative." And Mr. 
Stedman's " American Anthology " exhibits 
some hundreds of poets, most of whom " compose 
their verses with a diffident neatness which 
recalls the Latin style of classical scholars," and 
which " illustrates the temper not of a young 
but of a very old people." 

All this is fairly obvious, and the point 
hardly needs to be labored so much. Men 
change their skies but not their souls when they 
cross the seas, and it is not surprising that 
transplanted Englishmen should have remained 
Englishmen even after taking root in the new 
soil. LangTiage is quite as deep-seated a thing 
as any physical characteristic, and literary tradi- 
tion is inseparably bound up with inherited 
speech. Mr. Whibley simply recognizes this 
indubitable truth, and examines our literature 
in its light. It is well that English writers 
should do this from time to time, since there 
has always been a tendency among our kin 
beyond sea to look for the eccentric and bizarre 
in our literary output, and to acclaim it as 
peculiarly American by reason of its very diver- 
gence from normal English standards. The 
cases of Whitman and " Mark Twain " at once 
occur, but the writer does not find them serious 
stumbling-blocks. The former " represented 
America as little as he echoed the voice of the 
people," and the latter, despite his undeniable 



nationality, has a style and imagination " of 
universal truth and application." 

Something like a reasonable argument for the 
existence of a distinctively American manner in 
literary production may doubtless be based upon 
the variety of our writings reflective of local con- 
ditions. " Every province has its coterie, every 
county its school. The whole continent is pegged 
out in well-acknowledged claims. Boston culti- 
vates one style, Chicago another. Each comer 
makes the most of its own material, and cheer- 
fully discovers to the other states its character 
and temperament. The result is of great and 
varied interest. The social history of America 
is being written piecemeal, and written often 
with a skiU and sincerity which merit the high- 
est praise." Thus far Mr. Whibley, who admits 
this exception to his main proposition, and takes 
the argument for possibly more than it is worth. 
For, after all, the same sort of thing is being 
done in England, where the latest writers exploit 
local conditions with equal zeal to leave no aspect 
of modern life untouched. And all these writers, 
both English and American, employ the rich and 
flexible speech which is their common inherit- 
ance, and which has for not the least important 
of its qualities a generous hospitality for the new 
locutions with which the needs of new occasions 
may enrich it. The only thing that seems to us 
particularly worth saying about our more recent 
American literature, as distinguished from that 
of our earlier generation, is that it has caught 
up, or nearly so, with the development of the 
purest stock. We no longer write like the 
English contemporaries of our grandfathers, but 
mutatis mutandis^ like our English fellow- 
craftsmen of to-day. But we are as far as ever 
from being American in whatever concerns fun- 
damental form of expression or the deeper ideal- 
ism of the race, or, indeed, in aught save the 
accidents of our subject-matter. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The literary style of men of action, when these 
men have a style of their own, probably owes its excel- 
lence largely to the lack of that self-consciousness, that 
painful striving for effect, which mars the utterances of 
men of letters. "The mere writer," says the London 
" Spectator " in a late instructive article, " who must, 
like a silkworm, spin out his precious material from 
inside him, can hardly hope to rival the man of genius 
whose imagination has been quickened and whose tongue 
has been loosened by what Burke calls the 'overmas- 
tering necessities ' of events." The men who make 
writing a profession are commonly the men who do not 
do things to write about, as Walter Bagehot used to 



1908.]

complain; and, he might have added, the men who do 
things are usually too modest to write about them. 
But luckily some men of signal achievement have, on 
occasion, put pen to paper, with unmistakable effect. 
The " Spectator " cites, among other instances, Walter 
Ealeigh, Queen Elizabeth, Abraham Lincoln, Oliver 
Cromwell. In all American prose literature what pro- 
duction is there, of equal brevity, to compare with 
Lincoln's Gettysburg address ? Every sentence is per- 
fect, each word is the right one and in the right place. 
What a ready mastery, too, Grant had of clear and 
vigorous English ! " I propose to fight it out on this 
line, if it takes all summer," has become classic. 
Washington's stately style was, like his personality, 
impressive; and a few of his sentences have impressed 
themselves permanently in the memory. Perhaps the 
most familiar one, though often misquoted, is this from 
the " Farewell Address ": "'Tis our true policy to steer 
clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the 
foreign world." Mr. Cleveland, in his presidency, wrote 
some messages containing here and there a sentence or 
a phrase that, by virtue of the antiseptic of style, will 
not soon perish. " Innocuous desuetude " and " It is a 
condition which confronts us — not a theory " have 
proved so useful that we wonder how we got along so 
many years without these expressions. It is excellent, 
as Emerson says, to be the first quoter of a good sen- 
tence ; but how much better to be its originator ! 
■ > • 
How NOT TO BECOME A FICTION-TOPER is a question 
that troubles few if any novel-readers ; but to the libra- 
rian, and especially to the assistant in charge of the 
children's room of the library, the problem takes on a 
serious interest and has caused, first and last, many hours 
of thoughtful study. The Dayton Public Library, in 
its last annual report, announces some rather creditable 
results of a seemingly wise oversight exercised in the 
purchase and circulation of novels. The wisdom and 
the inoffensiveness of the course followed are to be in- 
ferred from the librarian's own account of the methods 
pursued. Little more than half of the circulation has 
been fiction, whereas in many admirably conducted libra- 
ries that we know of in commimities of intellect and 
culture the demand for novels amounts to nearly three- 
quarters of the total book demand. In Dayton, we 
learn, the circulation of fiction " has been lowest at the 
points of closest supervision, the schoolrooms, and 
highest at the branch libraries. The character of the 
reading in the main Library's children's room is being 
closely watched and improved by the children's librarian 
as she is given opportunity for advice and assistance in 
the selection of books. The term * fiction ' in our report 
includes all standard authors, as well as modern fiction, 
no novels being classed as ' literature ' in our statistics." 
New novels are sparingly bought, but those that seem 
worthy of purchase are supplied in generous duplication. 
In literary tone, if one may so express it, the Daytonians 
are being elevated by these and other wise measiires for 
nursing an interest in the less ephemeral products of 
the press. 

A CURIOSITY- AROUSING ANONYMITY — that of the 

gifted author of " Confessio Medici," commended by us 
in an earlier issue — is revealed, not only by internal 
and other evidence, but also by a confirmatory report 
from England, which declares the nameless writer to be 
Dr. Stephen Paget, an eminent London physician and 
son of the late Sir James Paget, who attained fame in his 
calling, was appointed surgeon to royalty, and left writ- 



ings and addresses having a wider scope than medicine. 
Some of these were, not many years ago, edited for pub- 
lication by the son, who is also known in literature for 
various original productions. To prove (if proof be asked 
for) that as an essayist the younger Paget is not un- 
worthy of his parentage, it may not come amiss to quote 
a characteristic passage from the " Confessio." In the 
chapter entitled " An Essay for Students " (and, by the 
way. Dr. Stephen Paget has already published a book 
called " Essays for Students ") the writer handles the 
subject of psychology in a light and graceful and enter- 
taining manner. Finding himself unable to regard the 
mind or soul as simply a succession of states of con- 
sciousness, which is all that psychology can make of it, 
he has this to say about psychical research: "We mean 
by it, mostly, a patient, critical, dispassionate enquiry 
into stories of ghosts, haunted houses, premonitions, 
thought-transference, and so forth. But I would rather, 
here, be passionate than dispassionate. The enquiry 
touches me too nearly; Psyche is on her trial; it is a 
matter of her life or death. I do not see the good of 
researching into Psyche without believing in her. If a 
man believes that she is a succession of states of con- 
sciousness, without anybody there to be conscious that 
these states are successive, his researches will be as 
vague — it is an old simile — as a blind man looking in 
a dark room for a black hat that is not in the room. I 
believe that Psyche may call to Psyche: but I do not 
believe that a succession, which is a word, not a thing, 
can call to another succession, or do anything, or be 
anything. I could as well imagine two calling to two, 
begging it to come and make four." 
• • • 
The reality of « the real Doone-Land " is some- 
thing not easy to escape, if viewed through the eyes of 
Mr. H. Snowden Ward, editor of the new " Lorna 
Doone." In a current magazine article from his pen, 
touching on some phases of his editorial task, he recog- 
nizes the likelihood that his illustrations to the book will 
arouse queries as to the actual location of the scenes 
depicted. " And these queries," he adds, " seemed to 
be followed naturally by others, with reference to the 
persons and the plot of the story. How much of the 
tale was founded on fact, how much drawn from local 
tradition, how much woven from the author's imagina- 
tion ? Again, was there ever a gang of Doone robbers, 
was there ever a ' girt ' Jan Ridd, and did a delicate 
dainty Lorna really sigh and shudder and suffer as the 
prisoner-princess of a lawless band ? " " These ques- 
tions," he replies, " gave excuse for some delightful 
work. What a pity that the reader cannot find in the 
answers a tithe of the pleasure that my wife and I found 
in the search ! The Doones of history have been traced, 
and while they still baffle us at certain points, it seems 
possible that if a reissue of the book is demanded, we 
may be able to bring the matter still further up to date." 
He then relates his success in tracing the originals of 
some of the characters — but not of Lorna herself, 
unluckily — and says that in identifying places he has 
been fairly fortunate. Those readers who are moved 
to visit these places will find, he is confident, " in addi- 
tion to the scenery, something of which we can give but 
little indication in the book. They will find a frank, 
hearty, hospitable, plain-spoken people ; they will realize 
that Blackmore's folk were drawn from life, and they 
will leave the land and the people — if they have stayed 
long enough to really know them — with an earnest wish 
to return often and to stay long."

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



A STUDY IN " LETTERED EASE " is fuTiiished, free, at 
any large public library reading-room, where many and 
varied are the types of those occupants of literary chairs 
who come early, stay late, and rarely take a vacation. 
One of the oddest specimens ever encountered was an 
old fellow at the British Museum described by David 
Masson in his posthumous " Memories of London in the 
'Forties," which his daughter is editing for serial publi- 
cation. "Having sent in his tickets," says Milton's 
biographer, condescending to a study of a much less 
illustrious man of letters, " he sat for a while quite idle, 
waiting for his books. They came at last, a very con- 
siderable pile ; and then he began operations. First he 
put his hat between his knees, adjusting it carefully so 
as to receive something; then putting his right hand 
into his coat-pocket behind, he fetched thence a red 
handkerchief and two eggs. Under the mask of the 
wall of books in front of him, he proceeded to chip one 
of the eggs. That it was raw was more obvious than 
pleasant; but, by tilting his head back, and an act of 
suction more visible than audible, he contrived to 
swallow the contents, dropping the shell furtively, when 
he had done so, into his open hat. He immediately 
performed the same process with the other egg; after 
which, as no third egg seemed to be forthcoming, I 
thought the entertainment over, and drew my eyes ofE 
him to attend to my own work. When I looked again, 
about ten minutes later, he was fast asleep, his head 
nodding over the hat, into which he had dropped the 
red pocket-handkerchief to conceal the two egg-shells, — 
and not a volume of the wall of books before him so 
much as opened ! Very possibly he was a philosopher; 
but he must have been of some deep and peculiar school, 
— investigating things ab ovo." 
• • • 
The opiophagia of Thomas De Quincey, which 
has given us one of the most famous and most widely 
read of our English classics, may turn out to be, after 
all, largely a matter of that tantalizing and incompre- 
hensible writer's vivid imagination. The world has long 
believed that opium was De Quincey's peculiar and dis- 
tinctive " tipple," but now comes forward a French 
savant, Dr. Guerrier, and avers that the English essayist 
was a veritable Miinchausen in his professed record of 
opium-eating. " The use of opium," says the French 
specialist, " in large doses and during a long period 
quickly produces great weakness and premature old 
age." Now De Quincey lived until he was seventy-three. 
At seventy he still covered with light step ten miles or 
so on foot. A friend reports that he climbed the hill- 
sides like a squirrel. Opium also destroys the memory. 
That of De Quincey remained perfect until his death. 
We have sought to show that the opiophagia of Thomas 
DeQuincey lies in the realm of legend. ... If he took 
opium at all, it must have been very little." Many 
readers must have felt the unconvincing quality of the 
Opium-Eater's voluble and brilliantly rhetorical " Con- 
fessions," just as one must, even with the best intentions, 
refuse to melt with pity for Carlyle's dyspepsia and 
insomnia — he turns them too readily and with too much 
artistic satisfaction to literary use. 

Mrs. Glyn's cheerful charm is reflected in the 
pages of the April " Book Monthly," which publishes an 
interview with her on her return from her first American 
visit and before her departure for a repetition of the 
pleasant experience. Asked whether our country was 
not clothed in gloom as a result of the financial panic, 



she replied: " Well, the papers have said so, but I was 
in America during the crisis and I did not come upon 
any signs of distress. When I landed at New York its 
air of prosperity just stared at me, and it was there — 
or so 1 thought — when I came away. Perhaps it will 
be there on my return, for it may be that a young coun- 
try cries out louder when anything happens to it, ill or 
well, than an older one." As one evidence, and to her 
a gratifying evidence, of this country's solvency, the 
English visitor might have added that two hundred thou- 
sand copies of her much-discussed " Three Weeks " have 
here found eager buyers. Of this book the interviewer 
reports her as saying that, whereas she wrote " The Visits 
of Elizabeth " for fun, to amuse herself, and might never 
have published it had not Lady Warwick seen the man- 
uscript and urged its publication, in the later story she 
"tried to write a book that should be a real human 
study — a study in love as a trinity. The hero and 
heroine of it are types of human nature, and so are they 
presented. What is the art of fiction-writing but the 
art, so far as one may succeed in it, of reflecting life, 
not as we would like it to be, but as it actually is in some 
phase or other." Indisputably true; and just because 
life " actually is " never precisely the same thing to any 
two novelists (or to any two persons of any calling, for 
that matter) it offers such limitless possibilities for the 
worker in any branch of art who essays to portray its 
lineaments. ... 

The homely charm of Hans Christian Ander- 
sen will never lose its power over children and over 
adults with an unspoilt taste for innocent delights. It 
was a fitting tribute to the entertainer who has cheered 
and brightened so many homes, that his own childhood's 
home, at Odense in Denmark, should be set apart as a 
permanent memorial, and as a sort of illustration and 
commentary to his tales. Of that one-roomed little 
house, with its roof -garden, he himself has written: 
" The walls, however, were covered with pictures, and 
over the workbench was a cupboard containing books 
and songs. The little kitchen was full of shining plates 
and metal pans, and by means of a ladder it was possible 
to go out on the roof, where, in the gutters between it 
and the neighbor's house, there stood a great chest filled 
with soil, my mother's sole garden, where she grew her 
vegetables. In my story of < The Snow Queen ' that 
garden still blooms. Green branches . . . ornamented 
our little room, which my mother always kept neat and 
clean; she took great pride in always having the bed 
linen and curtains very white." One likes to remember, 
among other incidents of that childhood, that little Hans 
used to take long rambles in the woods with his dreamy 
father, who would beguile the time by reading aloud from 
the " Arabian Nights " or from a dramatic poet, while 
his child threaded wild strawberries on slender grass- 
stalks. It was on the second of April, the hundred and 
third anniversary of Andersen's birth, that the house in 
which he was bom was opened to the public. 

An awakening of interest in Thibetan litera- 
ture is recognized and encouraged by recent action on 
the part of the trustees of the Newberry Library. A 
generous appropriation has been made for securing a 
collection of books and kindred material having to do 
with the life and literature of this little-known land. 
In the latest Newberry Library Report we read: " This 
work has been undertaken in connection with the Field 
Museum of Natural History, whose Assistant Curator of 
Asiatic Ethnology — Dr. Berthold Lauf er — has already

been dispatched on this errand. For the Field Museum 
he will conduct investigation and the purchase of a 
collection which will illustrate the ethnology of Thibet. 
For the Newberry Library he will gather a library of 
Thibetan literature, which associates itself with the 
literature of China, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. The 
recent marvellous development of these countries and 
their connection with our own country has created a 
demand for whatever can be obtained of authentic 
value, from original sources, relating to the thought, 
religion, history, government, and life of these nations." 
Only three collections — in London, Berlin, and St. 
Petersburg — similar to this in process of acquisition 
for Chicago, are in existence. The proposed addition 
to the Newberry Library's resources, taken in connection 
with the recent purchase of the Wilberforce Fames 
collection of works on the philology of the various 
nations of India, will make the library noticeably strong 
in Asiatic languages and literature.

The librarian's interest in bacteriology takes 
on a very practical complexion when, as last year in 
Portland, Oregon, a contagious disease spreads widely 
among the library's patrons. The unpleasant experience 
of Portland may be turned to profit in other places by 
pondering Miss Isom's report of what was done and 
what was left imdone in the library under her care. 
Speaking of the spinal meningitis epidemic that afflicted 
her city a year ago, she says : " At the height of the 
epidemic the Health Officer ordered the Library closed, 
and for two days the building and books were thoroughly 
fumigated with formaldehyde gas. The 7,500 volumes 
which were in circulation at the time were fumigated 
nightly on their return to the Library, a process extend- 
ing over four weeks. All this was so disagreeable and 
so alarming that it looked for a time as though confi- 
dence would never be restored and the Library resimie 
its customary activity." Feeling that these elaborate 
precautions might have been imnecessary or ill-advised, 
the authorities sought the counsel of many librarians 
and some bacteriologists, and finally reached the con- 
clusion " that it is better to destroy books where they 
have been exposed to contagious diseases, and that vapors 
from formaldehyde will not sterilize books stacked on 
shelves." Of course all this experience was purchased 
at the expense of a sad falling-off in the annual circula- 
tion — a sore loss to the ambitious librarian.

A rotating librarianship, one, that is, to which 
is applied the principle of rotation in public office, is a 
sight to arouse a sort of sad and bitter amusement. 
The retiring State Librarian of Maryland, in her letter 
of (enforced) resignation, indulges in some pardonably 
plain speaking to the Governor, who, by the way, is said 
to have selected a pretty young kinswoman of his own 
to fill the newly-created vacancy. We append a few 
sentences from the retiring official's letter. Her Parthian 
arrow is well aimed, well pointed, and properly barbed. 
" Referring to the paragraph of your letter in which you 
say that there are < so many applicants of sterling qiiali- 
ties, efficiency and good party record,' I must say that I 
cannot see how the appointment of another woman, and 
one without training or experience in library work, 
satisfies the requirements of the phrase quoted. For 
twelve years the State Library has been ' out of politics,' 
and my application for reappointment was based on 
experience, efficiency and faithful service. Many States 
are now alive to the fact that rotation in office is more 



detrimental to the interests of State libraries than to 
any other department of government, and, hence, the 
tendency now is to make the tenure of office dependent 
solely on the qualifications of the incumbent without any 
regard to the ' good of the party.' " The new libra- 
rian's professional experience appears to be an unknown 
if not a negative quantity.

The public library's rental shelves, where are 
to be had the latest officially approved popular novels, 
in a sufficient number of copies, at a small daily charge, 
are not yet to be found in many places; but even now, 
with the system in its tentative stage, objections have 
been raised to it. Four of these are answered by Miss 
Corinne Bacon, of the New York State Library School, 
in the April number of " New York Libraries." To the 
charge of illegality she replies that, as no test of this 
has ever been made in court, the objection is purely 
speculative. The assertion that to receive payment for 
the use of public-library books is contrary to the public- 
library spirit, is answered by citing the analogy of the 
public museum's special pay-day, and of the rented towel 
in the public bath. The claim that the rental system 
swells the fiction figures in the circulation statistics is 
dismissed as unproved, while even if it were established 
it would mean that novels sanctioned by a responsible 
board of examiners are read rather than, in all proba- 
bility, works of inferior excellence obtainable elsewhere. 
Finally, to the objection that the system discriminates in 
favor of those who can afford to pay for their reading, 
it is pointed out that the library always owns at least 
one free copy of every book on the pay shelves, and this 
free copy is rendered more easily available for the im- 
pecunious applicant by reason of its presence, in duplicate 
or triplicate, in the rental case.

Bookselling and book-renting are often carried on 
side by side and under the same management, shop-worn 
or soiled or second-hand books being relegated to the 
loan department of the business; but in a Philadelphia 
bookstore an attractive modification or reversal of this 
plan is in operation. On shelves accessible to the public 
there has been placed an inviting array of new novels, 
in alphabetical order, and from this supply of fresh, 
clean " best-sellers " (and best-lenders) any person of 
good credit may borrow such volume or volumes as he 
desires at two cents a day for each, the minimum charge 
on each book thus loaned being six cents, or a three-days' 
rental. With the first appearance of dog's-ears and 
thumb-prints a book is transferred to the hurt-book 
counter, there to await a buyer, and a fresh copy takes 
its place on the loan-shelves if the demand for it still 
continues. To the contemplative observer there might 
seem to be here an interesting possibility of such 
another lively book-battle as the celebrated London 
"Times" contest now known to all the world; but let 
us hope the peaceful Quaker City may not thus be 
turned into a battle-ground resounding with the din of 
trade strife and reeking with the flow of ineffectual ink.

The inviolability of authors' manuscript has 
recently been made the subject of legal discussion in a 
Brooklyn court. A publishing house has " edited " a 
writer's sheets with what seemed to him unwarrantable 
freedom, and he has sued for damages. The testimony 
elicited from various prominent editors and publishers, 
in the trial of the case, seems to be overwhelmingly in 
favor of the plaintiff. Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, for 



266 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



instance, deponed that "adding without consent new 
matter to an article is inadmissible, and there is no custom 
in the publishing trade by which an editor of a magazine 
may add to articles purchased by him without the con- 
sent of the author thereof; but, on the contrary, it is 
the custom not to change, add to, or alter such articles 
except with the consent of the author and upon the 
submission of proof sheets thereof to said author." Mr. 
George Haven Putnam, Mr. Henry Holt, and other pub- 
lishers testified to like effect. Mr. Holt's statement 
was that " during all his experience he had never heard 
of any custom justifying an editor or publisher in add- 
ing to any matter issued by him under the name of 
another person without the consent of such person ; or 
even in subtracting from it in essentials, though trifling 
abbreviations not changing the sense are admissible 
where it is necessary to bring the matter within defined 
limits." . , . 

The fate of an author's manuscript is some- 
times such as might move to tears, sometimes to 
laughter, and sometimes to philosophic reflection on 
the uncertainty of all things human. A manuscript of 
Ouida's is said to have been slumbering in the dusty 
seclusion of a London publisher's pigeon-hole for the 
past year or two, while its author was tasting the bitter- 
ness of poverty and loneliness. Whether the manuscript 
was paid for before it was pigeon-holed does not appear. 
We may hope it was, since it is the practice of many 
large publishing houses to purchase " copy " far in 
advance of their immediate needs. A New York firm, 
in a recent accounting of stock, discovered more than 
five hundred pieces of literary ware, paid for and 
awaiting publication — some of them had been waiting 
half a century, and many were from famous pens. But 
by no means all of them were found to have possessed 
life enough to keep them sweet; and so the mouldy 
stock had to go into the dust-bin, however illustrious 
the name it bore. , , , 

English as the language of literature and 
SCIENCE, as also the medium of oral and epistolary 
communication, is daily making fresh conquests. The 
use of their own tongue on the part of Harvard pro- 
fessors visiting German universities to lecture (whereas 
the Columbia professors hold forth in Grerman) is 
perhaps not unconnected, in a causal relation, with the 
announcement that henceforth the upper classes of the 
Grerman Latin schools will be permitted to substitute 
English for French in the modern language require- 
ments. This cannot, of course, mean that required 
French is to be dropped altogether; but, whatever the 
exact nature of the change, it marks, in the opinion of 
Professor Schofield, just home from his lectureship 
abroa'd, " the passing of French as the one essential 
language of a public man in Germany." Li fact, he is 
quoted as attributing this new development to the inter- 
change of German and American lecturers, and also to 
the growth of commercial relations between the two 
coimtries. ... 

The coming Tolstoi festival, the celebration of 
the venerable Russian's eightieth birthday next August, 
will be an event of very different significance to differ- 
ent persons. While some are hailing Tolstoi the novelist, 
the author of " War and Peace " and " Anna Kar^nina," 
others will lift worshipful eyes to Tolstoi the prophet and 
the social reformer, the utterer of " My Confession," 
" What is to be Done ? " and " The Kingdom of God is 
within You " ; and whether these two classes of admirers 



can be made to agree on any suitable and symmetrical 
programme of proceedings for the honoring of so dis- 
tinctly a double personality, is a question that may 
excite some disturbing doubts. The child's fatherhood 
of the man was never less apparent than in the develop- 
ment of this remarkable and variedly forceful character. 
The real and enduring worth of Count Tolstoi to the 
world in which he has so long and so conspicuously 
played his chosen part (or parts, rather) will perhaps be 
more accurately determined in the course of the next 
few months' inevitable reviews and discussions of his 
life and works. , , , 

State publications are not, as a rule, the most 
attractive of literature, if indeed they deserve to be 
called literature at all. They do not even form a part 
of that stately company of books which no gentleman's 
library should be without — and which no gentleman 
would ever dream of reading. But the " New Jersey 
State Publications on History, Geology, Geography, 
Climate, Resources, Industries and Other Topics," as 
brought to our attention in a little pamphlet prepared 
by Miss Mary E. Fannan, and issued by the Newark 
Public Library, have at least the merit of variety in 
their wide range of topics, and are believed to be desir- 
able acquisitions for public libraries. Those libraries 
that are so fortunate as to be within the State of New 
Jersey can obtain these publications free of charge. 

The man with the composing stick, a meritorious 
and voluminoils contributor to literature, but always 
modestly anonymous, and not seldom the object of petu- 
lant faultfinding, which is often wholly undeserved, must 
many times have figured, vaguely, elusively, enveloped 
in a nimbus of obscurity, to the reader's, and still more 
to the writer's, imagination. That he is a worthy per- 
sonage, entitled to our kindly consideration, is probably 
the general feeling; and consequently there will be gen- 
eral satisfaction in learning that his intellectual needs 
are to be looked out for, more carefully than hitherto, 
by a correspondence school established by the Inter- 
national Typographical Union. Full information may 
be had from the I. T. U. Commission, 120 Sherman 
Street, Chicago. ... 

Missouri's awakening to her library needs is 
testified to by her "First Annual Report of the Missouri 
Library Commission," which has just appeared, and 
which presents the results of one year's zealous labor 
for the cause of good literature in that great but not 
yet enthusiastically literature-loving State. The Com- 
mission has given much attention to travelling libraries 
— those precursors of the stationary library — and issues 
a separate booklet on " Traveling Libraries : What they 
are and how to secure them." From the Commission's 
table of statistics it appears that the whole State can 
boast of but twenty-two public libraries.

A commercially valuable assonance appears to 
be responsible for the present demand in the book- 
market for " Edwin Drood." The great public — the 
gullible public, as it so loves to prove itself — confused 
Drood and Druce, despite the faultiness of the asso- 
nance, and straightway clamored for Dickens's unfinished 
romance as being based on the Druce mystery. The 
newspapers spread the hoax, the booksellers cheerfully 
encouraged it, and a wide circle of readers embraced 
the opportunity to become acquainted with, or to renew 
their acquaintance with, an English classic.

An American Historian and 
Diplomat.* 



The publication of the first authentic biog- 
raphy of a man who has worthily served his 
country in affairs or letters is an important con- 
tribution to the literature of any period. When 
the subject of the biography has been promi- 
nently identified with both political and literary 
history, the popular interest is increased. If 
the biographer has been able to give a complete 
life-record, the results of both search and sifting, 
the reader feels gratitude as well as intellectual 
gratification. Such sentiments will occur to 
nearly all readers of the long awaited and now 
just published " Life and Letters of George 
Bancroft," by Mr. M. A. De Wolfe Howe. 

From the varied forms of biographic treat- 
ment the author has combined those of chronicler 
and interpreter. During the recital of significant 
events in the life of Bancroft and the nation, 
he keeps in the background, allowing letters to 
tell their own graphic story, and supplying only 
an occasional explanation in brief paragraph or 
footnote. In a final chapter of "Conclusions" 
he comes forward and speaks an epilogue of 
well-balanced judgment upon certain phases of 
his subject. Mr. Howe's scholarly interest was 
enhanced by motives of friendship ; a few years 
ago he was entrusted by Mrs. John C. Bancroft 
with papers and letters collected as a nucleus 
for the present biography. These have been 
used with sympathetic candor and reverence, 
and have been supplemented by other records, 
reminiscences, and letters, forming two volumes 
of convenient size and attractive form. The tone 
throughout is serious and dignified; there are 
several anecdotes and impressions of famous 
persons of America and Europe, but the anec- 
dotal quality is never pronounced. Mr. Howe 
evidently believes, with Mr. Edmund Gosse, 
that " a wise biographer has a higher aim than 
a collection of after-dinner stories." 

The interest, and often the style, of Mr. 
Howe's volumes suffers from unevenness ; cer- 
tain portions have a power of absorbing the 
reader, while other pages seem colorless. This 
fault may be due largely to the development of 
Bancroft's life and the scanty records of the 
earlier years. His personality gained steadily 
in attractiveness and service, culminating in an

DeWolfe Howe. In two volumes. Illustrated. New York:

old age of mellowness and remarkable activity. 
The biographer , has summarized this fact in 
his last sentence, — " The slope was upward to 
the end." He has fittingly lingered over the 
political and diplomatic experiences of Bancroft, 
who, although never ranked among our great 
statesmen, was a national character, and a maker 
as weU as a writer of history. 

The city of Bancroft's birth, Worcester, 
Massachusetts, has always been proud of her 
incidental honor. Although Bancroft left his 
home before he was ten years old, and returned 
only for brief visits, separated once by an inter- 
val of forty years, yet he always recalled his 
home with loving memory. He chose the city 
for his burial-place, and created for her youth 
a generous scholarship bearing the names of his 
father and mother. His father, the Eeverend 
Aaron Bancroft, preached Arminianism fear- 
lessly, was rejected as pastor of the established 
Congregational Church, but was chosen leader 
of a new " second parish." From him the son 
inherited independence, intellectual acumen, and 
a keen interest in American history (the elder, 
it will be recalled, had produced a "Life of 
Washington "). In a letter to Oliver Wendell 
Holmes, when the writer was eighty-four years 
of age and still able to do fourteen hours of 
consecutive mental work a day, George Bancroft 
traced his endurance to a good constitution, 
fostered by his father's urgence of daily exercise 
for body and mind in aU weather, and the reit- 
erated prayer of the household, " Give us a 
teachable temper." He had less of the spright- 
liness which characterized his mother, Lucretia 
Chandler, than others of her thirteen children, 
but he profited by her cheerful example and the 
wholesome daily diet which she recalls in one 
of her playful letters, — " rye bread tosted, the 
fragments of cold coffee boyled and put on milk." 
Through the influence of friends the boy 
Bancroft, who showed much mental assiduity 
at Exeter and Harvard, was given the use of 
university funds for four years' study at 
Gbttingen and later at Berlin. The letters of 
this period of preparation, which was at first 
intended for the ministry, are interesting tran- 
scripts of the social life of students at German 
schools when that country was beginning to 
exert an influence upon the cidture of England 
and America. Anecdotes and traditions, some 
of which have been set down previously by 
others, revive memories of German university 
professors of the past — Wolf, Schleiermacher, 
Dissen, Eichhorn, Heeren, and others. Ban- 
croft's vacation trips to Switzerland and Italy

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



awakened a romantic ardor which was expressed 
in his letters and more fully in the little book 
of " Poems," issued the year after his return to 
Cambridge. Mr. Howe is justified in passing 
by this Byronic effort with mere remark, for 
Bancroft did not encourage remembrance of it 
among his friends. The verses, however, reveal 
the emotional and mental condition of the young 
man, freshly impressed by the beauties and 
romance of the old world and uncertain of his 
own future work. He once defined his pains- 
taking histories as an attempt to write " an 
epic of liberty," and the poetic element in his 
nature was never eliminated by his researches. 
His history is literary and epical rather than 
scientific. Through this medium, instead of 
poetry, he won the fame for which he aspired 
so ardently in his student days, and of which 
he wrote, after his visit to the shrines of Italian 
poets : 

" By honour stung, to me too give 

In bold invention's heaven to soar, 
Nor all unknown to glory live, 

Nor perish to be named no more." 

As student, and later as diplomat, Bancroft 
responded naturally to German standards of 
scholarship and thought ; he also adopted certain 
European mannerisms which gave offense to his 
New England friends. " There were harsh 
changes in store for Bancroft when his wander- 
ings were done," says his biographer. He 
returned to Harvard as tutor in Greek, but he 
was unhappy ; he had broadened in religious 
and social ideas, while his friends had kept their 
tenets '• little modified through contacts from 
without." Anxious to reform the educational 
methods in America by some active service, and 
deciding that he was better fitted to teach than 
to preach, he joined his friend Joseph Green 
Cogswell in a plan for a school where he could 
work out his theories. Former pupils of this 
once-famous Roimd Hill School at Northampton 
have written interesting reminiscences concern- 
ing it, — notably Mr. Thomas Appleton, in his 
" Sheaf of Papers." Surrounded by beautiful 
scenery and supported by the patronage of 
aristocratic families in New England and New 
York, the school still failed to fulfil its promise, 
and proved a disappointing chapter in Bancroft's 
life, as it is in his biography. 

After closing his relations with the school, 
Bancroft still lived in Northampton for a time, 
writing articles for the " North American 
Review," translating treatises on history and 
political science by his friend, Professor Pleeren, 
and recalling his impressions of Goethe from 



acquaintance and study by a review of this 
author's work. His life abroad had stimulated 
his democratic principles, which he avowed so 
boldly that he became estranged from some 
Massachusetts friends. Mr. Howe has said 
with proper emphasis that Bancroft desired to 
be a national rather than a New England 
statesman. His Democratic fervor was evident 
in the first volume of his " History of the United 
States," which appeared in 1834 and was met 
by a warning protest from his brother-in-law, 
" honest " John Davis, Whig Governor of 
Massachusetts, who advised him " not to let 
the partisan creep into the work." 

The wife of Bancroft's youth, Sarah Dwight 
of Springfield, died in 1836, and the following 
year he joined his family and name with that 
of Mrs. Elizabeth Bliss, allied by birth and 
previous marriage with noted families of New 
England. For forty-eight years she was a true 
comrade to Bancroft, both in his diplomatic life 
and as adviser in his historical work. For seven 
years he served as Collector of the Port of 
Boston, with enough leisure for research and 
writing so that, by 1848, three volumes of the 
History had appeared. Following the election 
of Polk as President, and because of Bancroft's 
part in securing this success, the latter was 
appointed Secretary of the Navy, and filled this 
position and that of temporary Secretary of 
War with credit. Mr. Howe gives evidences 
of Bancroft's share in the acquisition of Cali- 
fornia and the establishment of the Naval 
Academy at Annapolis. 

Three years ago a volume of " Letters from 
England" by Mrs. George Bancroft gave de- 
tailed accounts of the social life which she and 
her husband enjoyed in England during the 
three years from 1846 to 1849, when he was 
Minister there. In the present biography the 
letters reflect the political and scholarly activ- 
ities of these years. There are interesting let- 
ters to Polk and his cabinet members, showing 
the changed attitude of England toward the 
United States as the Mexican War progressed, 
and also giving Bancroft's impressions of 
English aqd French statesmen and authors — 
notably Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston, 
Guizot, Lamartine, Macaulay, Hallam, and 
many others. 

Equipped with " superb material " which he 
had gathered for his History in England and 
France, Bancroft returned to eighteen years of 
authorship as a private citizen in New York 
and at his estate in Newport. The three vol- 
umes which had already appeared were increased

to nine before the close of 1867. During these 
years of writing, he kept in touch with the 
current political, social, and esthetic interests 
of America. Always opposed to slavery he was 
yet a Douglas Democrat, distrusting Lincoln at 
first but later becoming a strong admirer and 
his eulogist in Congress. In this memorial 
oration Bancroft gave another proof of his 
tactless independence by comparing, with scath- 
ing epithets, Lord Palmerston with Lincoln. 
Although he had arranged for the absence of 
the British minister, as Mr. Howe has stated, 
yet his words increased the bitterness of feeling 
against him on the part of English newspapers 
and American opponents. 

There has been a lurking suspicion in many 
minds that Hawthorne's appointment as Consul 
at Liverpool was the result of his admiring biog- 
raphy of his friend, Franklin Pierce, published 
just before the latter 's election as President. 
An unfortunate shadow of a similar kind has 
been cast on Bancroft's memory by the discovery 
of evidence, collated and published by Professor 
Dunning of Columbia, that Bancroft wrote 
Andrew Johnson's first annual message to 
Congress. The surmise is that Bancroft was 
rewarded with the diplomatic place which had 
long been his goal — that of Minister to Berlin. 
Mr. Howe gives frankly the proofs of Bancroft's 
service to Johnson, so long a secret ; but he 
emphasizes Bancroft's special fitness for the posi- 
tion, and his other political services, which should 
be remembered to his credit. The account of 
his life in Germany, during the crucial years of 
the Franco-Prussian war and the readjustments 
in Germany and France, is given with zest. In 
his letters vital impressions of great international 
events are commingled with records of conversa- 
tions with Bismarck, Bunsen, Von Moltke, and 
various literary celebrities whom Bancroft met 
at the club of savants to which he belonged. 
Again, as in other political crises and in his 
History, the partisan spirit and its too frank 
expression brought him into controversies ; 
Victor Hugo expressed in " L'Annee Terrible " 
the indignation of many Frenchmen against 
what they considered an official bias towards 
Germany and lack of neutrality on the part of 
President Grant as well as of his representative 
in Germany. 

Bancroft was seventy-four when he returned 
to America, chose Washington as his residence, 
and published the tenth volume of his History. 
The average man of good health and industry 
would feel that his life-work was nearing its 
end at this age, but Bancroft did not accept 



such a belief. He realized that his History must 
be circumscribed by the period from America's 
discovery to her real beginning as a nation ; but 
he determined to make that segment more com- 
plete by writing a " History of the Formation of 
the Constitutions," which he published, in two 
volumes, in 1882. He also revised two editions 
of his History, — the centenary edition of 1876 
and the later one of 1883. An interesting page 
in Mr. Howe's biography is given to a compar- 
ison, in parallel columns, of the earlier ornate 
and discursive description of the colony of 
Virginia, in the original form in 1834, and 
the brief and direct style in the last revised 
edition. These " final years " of the historian's 
life are pictured with graphic effect — his inces- 
sant activities in library, garden, or on horse- 
back, and the tireless zeal which called from 
Holmes the comment, " You must be made of 
iron and vulcanized india-rubber, or some such 
compound of resistance and elasticity." 

Mr. Howe offers no detailed examination of 
the History. Some salient traits of Bancroft 
at the time of his greatest productivity are 
pointed out. The most marked characteristic 
was his industry ; a second was the " fervid 
belief in himself " which involved him in private 
and literary controversies such as that of the 
" Grandfather's War," following his estimates 
of certain Revolutionary generals. His avid 
grasp after first-hand material led sometimes 
to his placing a disproportionate value upon 
manuscripts over later and revised publications. 
The method by which he kept, in diaries, the 
calendar of each year that he was studying his- 
torically, noting not alone the major events but 
also lunar changes, etc., of each day, indicated 
his earnest desire for accuracy and realism. 
These diaries, with his other papers and books, 
are now in the Lenox Library of New York, not- 
withstanding Bancroft's earnest desire to have

There are no comparisons suggested here

historical writing, — Motley, Prescott, and Hil- 
dreth, — or his successors of our own generation. 
Of the earlier group he is entitled to rank as a 
pioneer by reason of the extent and research of 
his studies. It is doubtful if Bancroft's History 
is read voluntarily by many youths to-day, or 
if it is really enjoyed when re-read by many of 
middle life. The author failed to achieve the

found in Motley, Prescott, and Parkman. In 
his " Conclusions" Mr. Howe lays due emphasis 
upon the inter-relation of Bancroft with his age 
and his literary work ; he cites many failings 
judged by current criticism, but in extenuation 
of Bancroft's aim and methods he says : 

" Into these the personal equation and what may be 
called the temporal equation vitally entered. Especially 
n the free use of his materials must he be judged 
according to the standards of his day. It was a day in 
which quotation marks were not the sacred enclosures 
they have become. . . . Admit the worst, that at times, 
with his immediate ends in view, he made such uses of 
his manuscript materials as to impair their value to 
future students \ yet remember always that he col- 
lected these materials with a thoroughness and an 
appreciation of their worth which the most modern of 
historians can hardly surpass, and that his pioneer work 
in this direction has been of untold benefit, actual and 
suggestive, to many who have come after him."

The Optimism of ScieK^ce.* 



Professor Metchnikoff, after many years of 
devotion to science, and with an intimate knowl- 
edge of the ills which afflict mankind, declares 
himself an optimist. This he does for no meta- 
physical reasons ; no " Power divine which 
moves to good " has ever been observed in his 
laboratory ; he has not " the remotest idea if 
nature has any ideal and if the appearance of 
man on the earth were a part of such an ideal," 
(p. 333 ; a curious sentence, no doubt better in 
the original French). He has lived, however, 
to see the physical evils of human existence 
conspicuously lessened through scientific dis- 
coveries, in the development of which he has 
had a most honorable part. To him, it is 
Science, not Religion, which is to be the regen- 
erator : for " Science has already justified the 
hopes which have been placed in it. It has 
saved peoj)le from the most terrible diseases, 
and has made life much easier. On the other 
hand, religions which demand an uncritical 
faith as the means of curing the ills which afflict 
humanity have not fulfilled their promises." 

Of the various evils which may be lessened or 
banished by the intelligent application of scien- 
tific methods, disease and premature death are 
the most important. Professor Metchnikoff, 
realising in his own person some of the disadvan- 
tages of old age, has been led to raise the ques- 
tion : Why shoidd the last period of life be so 
handicapped by manifold disadvantages, and

Mitchell. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



nearly always cut short by some pathological 
process ? There are savages who have so little 
regard for their old people that they do not hesi- 
tate to eject them forcibly from the world ; but 
among civilized peoples, where there is so much 
to be learned, where experience is so costly and 
so precious, the cutting off of the elders can 
scarcely be regarded with satisfaction. The 
mere prolongation of life is not Metehnikoff's 
ideal; he has no deSire to see the number of 
helpless aged increased ; but he maintains that 
it should be possible to prolong the period of 
active and useful existence far beyond its pre- 
sent customary limit, and that if this were done 
people would at length die normally and hap- 
pily, as they sleep. The tragedy of death, for 
them and for their friends, would cease to exist, 
and thus the sorrow of mankind would be 
lightened to an immeasurable degree. 

Whatever we may think of Professor Meteh- 
nikoff's philosophy, the ideal thus set forth is a 
noble one, and perhaps not wholly imattainable. 
Should it be realized, " old age will be post- 
poned so much that men of from sixty to seventy 
years of age will retain their vigour, and will not 
require to ask assistance in the fashion now neces- 
sary. On the other hand, young men of twenty- 
one years of age will no longer be thought mature 
or ready to fulfil functions so difficult as taking 
a share in public affairs" (p. 329). 

The present dominance of the comparatively 
young may appear to be justified as promoting 
progress ; but it is at least doubtful whether 
the period of life during which the struggle for 
personal advantage is fiercest, and the outlook 
narrowed in consequence, is one in which it is 
possible to take a broad view of public affairs. 
There are few in this country who would exclude 
the young man from politics, but both in politics 
and education we might well afford to exchange 
some measure of our restless youthful energy 
for the calm wisdom of maturity. We could 
afford this, but perhaps the exchange is not 
necessary. In countries happy in the possession 
of wise and esteemed old men, it is delightful to 
see the youth, fired by their ideals and example, 
adding thereto the vigor and enterprise they 
possess so abundantly ; not too slavishly fol- 
lowing the masters, but in every good sense 
upholding and continuing the golden threads of 
past achievement. Thus the later years of 
Ruskin, Darwin, Gladstone, and others were of 
priceless value to the generation following. On 
the other hand, those who have had to do with 
education know too well that the mere contact 
of youth with youth fails to produce either

breadth of view or desirable ideals ; and there 
are some at least who for this very reason regret 
the prevalent immaturity of the present gener- 
ation of teachers. Those of us who have read 
with enthusiasm of the zeal displayed by German 
students of the forties in upholding their ideal- 
istic political views, find it humiliating to dis- 
cover that American students of to-day are 

similarly energetic in defending nothing 

better than their " right " to engage in horse- 
play or become intoxicated. 

But to return to Metchnikoff, and his plans 
for promoting robust longevity. He is per- 
suaded, after considering the subject from every 
point of view, that intestinal bacteria are to 
blame for most of the trouble. The discussion 
is scientific and technical, and cannot be con- 
densed here ; but he concludes that a most 
important remedy is found in the bacteria of 
soured milk, or lactic acid bacteria, which in- 
hibit putrefaction in the large intestine. He 
himself has employed this treatment for many 
years, and is well satisfied with the result. " A 
reader who has little knowledge of such matters 
may be surprised by my recommendation to 
absorb large quantities of microbes, as the gen- 
eral belief is that all microbes are harmful. 
This belief, however, is erroneous. There are 
many useful microbes, amongst which the lactic 
bacUli have an honourable place" (p. 181). 
Nevertheless, the subject is said to be still very 
imperfectly understood ; it wUl be necessary to 
test the theory by numerous observations, car- 
ried on for considerable periods of time. " In 
the meantime, those who wish to preserve their 
intelligence as long as possible and to make 
their cycle of life as complete and as normal as 
is possible under present conditions, must depend 
on general sobriety and on habits conforming to 
the rules of rational hygiene " (p. 183). 

Although Professor Metchnikoff's book is 
important on account of its topic, and interest- 
ing and suggestive in its treatment of it, it is 
impossible to praise it very highly from a literary 
standpoint. The translation is probably accu- 
rate, but too literal to be elegant. The whole 
structure of the book, however, can only be 
described as loose-jointed, and this cannot be 
peculiar to the English version. The latter haK 
contains a number of rather disconnected essays, 
including a lengthy dissertation on Goethe and 
" Faust," in which some serious problems are 
raised and, on the whole, left rampant. "With 
praiseworthy honesty, the author is careful to 
exhibit the different sides of the questions he 
discusses and to cite the adverse criticisms of 



his contemporaries. Qften, however, we are 
left in a rather puzzled condition, not knowing 
how to estimate the value of the statements 
made. Thus, at the end of the discussion of 
remedies, we find the words regarding general 
sobriety and so forth, quoted above ; and we natu- 
rally think that in this rather vague statement 
we have an irreducible minimum. But on page 
91 our attention is called to the following : 

" Sobriety is certainly favourable to long life, but it 
is not necessary, because quite a number of centenarians 
have drunk freely. Several of those who are catalogued 
by Chemin,* drank wine and spirits even to excess. 
Catherine Reymond, for instance, who died in 1758 at 
the age of 107 years, drank much wine; and Politiman, 
a surgeon who lived from 1685 to 1825, was in the habit, 
from his twenty-fifth year onward, of getting drunk every 
night. ... A most curious example is that of the Irish 
land owner Brawn, who lived to the age of 120, and who 
had an inscription put upon his tombstone that he was 
always drunk, and when in that condition was so terrible 
that even death had been afraid of him." 

Even the scientific statements cannot all be 
accepted without question. It is no doubt the 
fault of the translator that in one or two places 
moths are called butterflies ; but the assertion 
on page 100 that Amaryllis lutea " passes 
through. all the stages of its life-history in ten 
days " evidently rests on a misconception. The 
plant is a bulb, and the ten days must refer 
simply to the reproductive period, which is a 
very different matter. To discuss all the debat- 
able points would, however, be equally impos- 
sible and inappropriate in this place. The illus- 
trations are decidedly unsatisfactory, largely as 
the result of poor presswork and probably of 
old blocks. T. D. A. Cockerell.

"Ik Marvel," and his Books.* 



The publication of the " Edgewood Edition" 
of the works of Donald G. Mitchell emphasizes 
the fact that the history of American Literature 
covers a very short period of time. Two lives 
take us back to the beginning. Washington 
Irving read " The Reveries of a Bachelor " 
with delight, and accepted the dedication of 
" Dream Life " to himself " as an outward sign 
that we are linked cordially in sympathies and 
friendship." The fifteen beautiful volumes 
before us form a vista through which we look 
back to the days of " Salmagundi," " The Tales

Sons.

of a TraveUer," and " The Sketch Book." " Ik 
Marvel " was sixty years ago hailed as the 
natural successor of " Geoffrey Crayon, Gent." 
And " Ik Marvel " has lived to write charming 
prefaces to his numerous works, in 1907. 

Washington Irving inherited directly from 
Goldsmith. He carried into the America of 
the nineteenth century the style of the English 
essayists of the eighteenth century. He was 
accused of lacking that highly prized and yet 
rarely defined quality, " Americanism." Did 
he not delight to tell the story of rambles in the 
old world ? Was there not a genial warmth in 
his account of an English country house ? Did 
he not throw the glamor of old-world romance 
over new- world scenes? Was not his humor 
quiet rather than obstreperous ? Did he not 
prefer meditation to business ? 

After answering all these queries in the 
affirmative, one may add that in these respects 
Irving was very like a considerable number of 
his countrymen. They, too, had an affectionate 
interest in the land of their forefathers, and a 
preference for the amenities of life. It is to 
this class that Donald G. Mitchell belongs. 
Throughout his literary life there has been a 
noticeable detachment from contemporary inter- 
ests. In the early fifties, when the country 
was aflame with anti-slavery agitation, he wrote 
" The Reveries of a Bachelor " and " Dream 
Life." During the Civil War no echoes of the 
strife are allowed to disturb the agricultural 
meditations of " Edgewood Farm." This Amer- 
ican country-gentleman has lived the life of an 
English country-gentleman of literary procliv- 
ities. He looks out upon the world from his 
snug retreat as Horace Walpole looked out upon 
it from his imitation castle on Strawberry Hill. 

Mr. Mitchell, though he has written much 
and well, is still known as the author of " The 
Reveries of a Bachelor." One takes up the 
book with a little trepidation. Will it bear re- 
reading ? What a very young bachelor he was ! 
He was only haK through his twenties, and yet 
his air was so solemnly reminiscent. In the 
strenuous days of President Roosevelt there 
seems something artificial in the pose. Why 
should a young fellow of twenty-six assimie to 
have reached " the years that bring the philo- 
sophic mind," and sit by the fire, whether it be 
of crackling hickory or glowing anthracite? 
Why should he not be up and doing ? 

Then we remember that literary taste " be- 
fore the war " was not intolerant of sentiment 
or even of sentimentality. Young gentlemen 
indulged their feelings in the publicity of 



prose, and did not feel compelled to hide behind 
the veil of esoteric verse. In fact, it was a 
period when the distinction between prose and 
verse had broken down. A generation that en- 
joyed versified novels like " Aurora Leigh " and 
" Lucile " had a warm welcome for prose-poems. 

The fact that the " Reveries " and "Dream- 
Life " have had a steady sale for half a century is 
a reassuring sign that the reading public does 
not really grow old. There are always certain 
readers who are in their twenties, and some of 
them have the courage of their convictions. 
The underlying conviction is that they have 
lived long, and seen through many illusions, and 
pondered deeply the problems of life, and have 
left only one problem unsolved, — does the Per- 
fect Woman belong to the category of the existent 
or the non-existent ? As the fire flames or fades 
they grow sentimental or cynical, and find them- 
selves equally interesting in either condition. 

All this was pleasantly set forth by Mr. 
Mitchell before he turned his mind to the more 
mundane matters of sub-soiling and the rotation 
of crops. It is well that in the later editions 
he refrained his hand from his earlier work. He 
could only have marred the completeness of 
the impression. Here at least it is true that 
" second thoughts are prose." 

If in his first books Mr. MitcheU takes us 
back to the past, it must be said that the work 
of his maturer days was in some respects that 
of a pioneer. Within half a dozen years there 
has been a great revival in out-of-door litera- 
ture. Scores of books have been written and 
periodicals published setting forth the charms of 
country life. It is part of a most hopeful move- 
ment back to the land. It was not so in 1863, 
when " My Farm of Edgewood " was published. 
The question had not then become urgent, — 
" Do you find your brain taking breadth or 
color out of carrot raising or pumpkins ? " Mr. 
Mitchell had to educate his readers to an appre- 
ciation of the possibilities of the farm. As a 
literary farmer he has been a great success, and 
his career has been a refutation of his own thesis 
that the practice of agriculture is not conducive 
to intellectual development. He has managed 
to get two crops from his land, using the rainy 
days to gather in the " harvest of a quiet eye." 
Perhaps he has been too good a farmer to get 
the best, or rather the most lucrative, literary 
results. The " best sellers " have been books 
confessing to such amazing misadventures in the 
art of husbandry that even we of laity, pent up 
in cities, could see the joke and join with Reuben 
and Jake in their laughter. Mr. Mitchell never

made blunders of sufficient magnitude to be 
broadly amusing. When he takes us into his 
confidence he never gets beyond the quiet humor 
of a man who can point out the fact that 
Connecticut is not Arcadia. 

There is a pleasant contrast between the 
bookishness of " Wet Days at Edge wood " and 
the homely common-sense of the volume en- 
titled " Out of Town Places, with hints for 
their improvement." But everywhere there is a 
serious enthusiasm for country life and all it 
brings with it. He is no fickle lover, and he 
warns his readers that they must be content with 
no superficial preference for rural things. " I 
would not counsel any one to think of a home in 
the country whose heart does not leap when he 
sees the first grass-tips lifting in the city court- 
yards, and the boughs of the Forsythia adrip 
with golden censers. Many a man mistakes a 
certain pleasurable association of his boyhood 
days with the, country for an earnest love ; it 
may be only a sentiment which will wilt with the 
scorching heats of August, and will die utterly 
when the frosts nip the verdure of the year." 

No man of letters, if he lives long enough, 
escapes writing a novel. Mr. Mitchell's novel, 
" Dr. Johns," has shared the fate of Henry 
Ward Beecher's " Norwood," which was of the 
same period. It is remembered as the work of 
a man who had done better things. 

Throughout these volumes we have many 
glimpses of the warm friendship existing be- 
tween the author and his publisher, Mr. Charles 
Scribner. Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have 
in this beautiful edition furnished a memorial 
of this friendship. Not all these volumes are 
likely to be read, but it is good to have them 
bound together. Of the best of them we may say, 
as Mr. Mitchell says of " The Sketch Book ": 

" I know there is a disposition to speak of it rather 
patronizingly and apologetically — as if it were reminis- 
cent — Anglican — conventional — as if he would have 
done better if he had possessed our modern critical 
bias — or if he had been born in Boston — or born a 
philosopher outright: Well, perhaps so — perhaps so. 

" But I love to think and believe that our dear old 
Mr. Irving was born just where he should have been 
born, and wrote in a way that it is hardly worth our 
while to try and mend for him. 

" I understand that a great many promising young 
people — without fear of the critics before their eyes — 
keep on persistently reading that old Sketch Book, 
with its ' Broken Hearts,' and ' Wife ' twining like a 
vine, and ' Spectre Bridegroom,' and all the rest." 

And I suspect that those same promising young 
people are also still reading the " Reveries of a 
Bachelor " and " Dream Life."

Memories of Two Coxtinents.* 



Colonel Clark E. Carr, already known 
through his contribution to the history of 
Illinois — " The Illini : A Story of the Prairies " 
— and his shorter work on " Lincoln and 
Gettysburg," has led a life sufficiently varied 
and eventful to warrant expectation that any 
reminiscences published by him in this his 
eighth decade must prove of rather unusual 
interest. Born in Erie County, N. Y., in 1836, 
but early transplanted to Illinois soil, choosing 
the law for his profession and Republicanism 
for his political creed, he became a zealous anti- 
slavery worker and has taken an active part 
in nearly every important pre-election campaign 
since that of 1856^ when he mounted the stump 
for Fremont. In the Civil War he served as 
colonel on the staft* of Governor Yates, the " war 
governor." Chosen a delegate to the national 
Republican convention of 1864, he was again 
appointed a delegate, this time at large, in 1884. 
Under President Harrison he served as United 
States Minister to Denmark, and at the Paris 
Exposition of 1900 he did our Western farmers 
a good turn by his successful management of 
the American Com Kitchen, which accomplished 
so much in creating a demand for our national 
cereal in countries until then ignorant of its 
virtues. 

With such a fund of experience to draw 
upon, and with a retentive memory and a facile 
pen. Colonel Carr has produced, in " My Day 
and Generation," a thoroughly readable book, 
brisk, breezy, and cheerful, and, one cannot but 
believe, admirably characteristic of the writer, 
whose friendly countenance and ample propor- 
tions make an attractive frontispiece to the 
volume. Twenty-eight chapters — all short ex- 
except the first, which describes in detail " A 
Journey to California in 1869 with Governor 
Yates " — present a rapid succession of partial 
portraits and of glimpses of things seen in 
America and Europe. 

Happening to meet with Carl Schurz in that 
early California journey, the author has recorded 
his recollections of the man, and especially com- 
pliments him on his command of our language ; 
but, in seeking to account for the unusual ele- 
gance and purity of his speech. Colonel Carr 
apparently confuses Schurz with Kossuth. It 
was the Hungarian who is said to have thumbed 
his Shakespeare to such excellent practical pur- 
pose behind prison bars ; the German patriot

underwent no such period of incarceration, but 
acquired his English by oral exercise in London 
and, later, in this country. Another little matter 
in which one is tempted to put the author right : 
he extdts in the freedom from custom-house 
annoyances that makes travel through our broad 
land so delightful as compared with a journey 
across Europe, and he thus complacently ex- 
presses himself : " Notwithstanding all the 
extravagant declamation of the doctrinaires 
about what they are pleased to call ' the robber 
tariff,' ours is the greatest free-trade country 
of the earth." This assertion, just at this time, 
will to some seem a little amusing. 

Among the famous men of an earlier day 
whom Mr. Carr met and talked with were 
Lincoln, General Sherman, Owen Lovejoy, 
Martin Van Buren, Eobert G. Ingersoll, 
Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin F. Wade, and 
Oliver P. Morton ; but concerning none of these 
public characters does he record anything so 
noteworthy and characteristic as to call for 
quotation here. An account of a call on Hayes, 
at Columbus, in those days of suspense in 
February, 1876, shows us the soon-to-be Presi- 
dent in a state of eager, almost boyish, expecta- 
tion that may surprise the reader and lead him 
to doubt whether, if the odd vote had gone the 
other way, the defeated candidate would have 
borne his disappointment with all the dignified 
calm displayed by his rival. 

Some of the best pages in the book treat of 
matters European, and more particularly Dan- 
ish. From the many passages concerning the 
late King Christian IX., " the grandfather of 
Europe," a few sentences describing the new 
American Minister's reception at his hands may 
be of interest here. 

" It is said that, as a Minister represents his sovereign, 
or as in my case his chief magistrate, no one has suffi- 
cient rank to present him to the sovereign to whom he 
is accredited. Certainly on this occasion I was quite 
alone with the King in the audience-chamber. I had 
never before been in the presence of royalty, and it 
was only natural that I should feel some degree of 
embarrassment. This, I think, His Majesty observed ; 
not, as I came to believe, to my discredit. . . . 

" In the most perfect English the King replied, wel- 
coming me to Denmark, and expressing the hope that 
my residence at Copenhagen would be agreeable, both 
to myself and to my family, which terminated the 
formal audience. I had been made aware that it is 
the privilege of royalty to end all interviews, and sup- 
posed of course that the time had come when the King 
would signify that my business was finished. Not so. 
His Majesty continued: 

" ' I am very happy, Mr. Minister, to welcome you just 
now to my home. You are to dine with my wife and 
me [he did not say " the Queen "], and we have with us 
our children and grandchildren assembled under this 



roof. You are this evening to be one of our family 
circle. I will present you to them, and hope that you 
will make friends with us all, as we will do with you. 
We shall soon expect to receive your wife and children, 
and hope that before very long you will feel that you 
are at home in our dear Denmark.' " 

One chapter is devoted to the Codex Flatey- 
ensis or Flatey Book, which, some readers may 
like to be reminded, is an ancient Icelandic 
manuscript containing, among other historical 
or semi-historical narrative, an account of what 
was probably the first visit of white men to these 
shores. Written more than five hundred years 
ago, the Flatey Book is Denmark's most precious 
literary possession. Consequently when, in the 
autumn of 1892, Minister Carr was instructed 
from Washington to ask for the loan of the 
priceless parchment, for public exhibition at the 
Columbian Exposition, the Danish authorities 
were strongly disinclined to grant the request. 
But as public interest in the matter grew, and 
as our country had offered to take the most 
extraordinary precautions to protect the volume 
from loss or injury, even to the sending of a 
war vessel for its convoy, Denmark at last con- 
sented — too late, however, as may be remem- 
bered, for all our available ships of war had by 
that time been ordered to New York to take 
part in the great naval parade. A facsimile 
reproduction from the venerable codex and a 
short account of its history and contents close 
the chapter. 

In enumerating Mr. Carr's public offices, we 
have omitted his appointment to the postmaster- 
ship of Galesburg in 1861. To that appoint- 
ment we probably owe his excellent chapter on 
" The Eadway Mail Service," since it was his 
official duty that brought him into communica- 
tion with George B. Armstrong, originator of 
that service, and a man of something like genius 
in his chosen work. The story of the organizing 
and perfecting of this department of the post- 
office is told from first-hand information, and an 
account is given of a trip on the first fast mail 
train (whoUy of mail cars) that ran — from New 
York to Chicago, September 16-17, 1875. It 
is reassuring to learn how rare are the mistakes 
made in the handling of the twenty million pieces 
of mail matter that now pass from sender to 
receiver in the course of a year: the errors 
amount to about one in twelve thousand pieces 
handled. 

Colonel Carr's pen is not so severely correct 
as to be incapable of making an occasional slip. 
Of Judge Taney (of Dred Scott fame) who was 
born in 1777 and died in 1864, the author says 
that he died at the age of eighty-five, though

the dates of his birth and death are correctly 
given. In expressing himself, Mr. Carr occa- 
sionally indulges in a tangled or otherwise 
awkward construction — but not often. Amid 
periods so irreproachable as most of his are, it 
is somewhat disconcerting to encounter an infini- 
tive that is not simply split with an adverbial 
wedge, but actually rent asunder as with dyna- 
mite. Let us illustrate : " When I told him we 
were [going to the Yosemite], he expressed a 
desire to, with his wife, who was on board, join 
us and be of our party." The many illustra- 
tions and clear print contribute to the attractive 
appearance of this inviting book.

Recent Educational, Discussions.* 

Worthy of far more space than can be given it here 
is Dr. W. E. Chancellor's recently published " Theory 
of Motives, Ideals, and Values in Education." Super- 
ficiality is a common fault of educational writing 
of the day, which runs too much to " the elaboration 
of the obvious." So far removed is this book from 
any such weakness that one often feels that the 
author is still struggling to express the conception 
which is as yet new even to him ; often, too, one 
finds himself, at least on first reading, in sharp 
opposition to the views propounded. More careful 
reading wiU clear up many apparent obscurities, and 
doubtless mature consideration will bring one closer 
to the author's radical positions. The book is not 
for all readers, but rather for those who can bring 
to it some knowledge of philosophical as well as edu- 
cational thought. To such it will prove a stimulus 
and inspiration. Every teacher may well feel a deep 
satisfaction in the production of so strong and able 
a work on the deeper problems of his profession. 

We wish to call attention briefly to three or four 
characteristic features of the work. The first is the 
proposition that education should be independent of 
all external control; this the author maintains in 
one of his most powerful chapters, entitled " The 
Subordination of the School." To the average 
American, the state-controlled public school is a 
sacred thing, even though he worships it somewhat 
as a fetish ; to Dr. Chancellor, the State School 
is " a disease " with " disagreeable complications."

upon the Church than upon the State." The present

system, he assures us, is a mere transition; the 
School is not to return to the control of the Family 
or of the Church, but it is to go free from the State. 
What is to come is "the independence of a sufficient 
group of educators from all external control (save, 
of course, public opinion)." The American school- 
system stands alone in its non-professional and local 
control. Germany and France have professional 
authority for all educational affairs, and central 
control for all large general matters. (England 
has, of course, as yet no school system, but only a 
" Schulwesen.") But in America we not only put 
our common schools into the hands of unexpert, 
sometimes even uneducated, persons, — we do not 
hesitate to entrust even higher education, the uni- 
versity itself, to the absolute and final discretion of 
men to whom in some cases the very nature and 
problems of higher education are quite unknown. 
The facts of the usurpation in question are summed 
up by Dr. Chancellor thus : " Wherever the public 
school of the State exists, there it is absolutely con- 
trolled and in every respect directed by a political 
board of education. The superintendent, if any 
there be, is chosen by that board. Courses of study, 
text books, rules and regulations, generally appoint- 
ments, transfers, discharges, and always salaries of 
teachers, are determined by the board" (p. 132). 

The most original portion of the book is Chapter 
VIII., which deals mainly with " The Progressive 
Stages of Education," or, rather, the stages of the 
development of the individual soul, which of course 
must determine the course of rational education. 
Dr. Chancellor names seven of these stages ; we 
summarize them with some hesitation and with apolo- 
gies for possible misinterpretation. First, the dawn 
of consciousness ; second, the awareness of the body ; 
third, acquaintance with the outer world ; foirt'th, 
knowledge of one's own soul, and hence of the 
duality of soul and body ; fifth, the attainment of 
self-direction ; sixth, the power to control others ; 
seventh and highest, " the comprehension of the 
world-spirit." Few reach the higher stages ; 
Napoleon and Washington lived in the sixth, the 
first as a failure and the second as a success in it ; 
even Plato and Socrates and Lincoln failed to attain 
the seventh ; Jesus alone has attained it. In this 
chapter the reader feels most of all that the author 
has not fully succeeded in clothing his ideas in ade- 
quate form; but it is perhaps none the less worth 
reading for that. 

From the multitude of other striking propositions 
in this work, we pick two almost at random. Dr. 
Chancellor derides the prevalent prejudice against 
married women as teachers, — and it must be ad- 
mitted that he makes out a good case for the opinion 
that every staff of teachers should include a consider- 
able proportion of mothers. "A high-school of a 
thousand students needs a faculty of forty or fifty 
teachers, ten or a dozen fathers, as many mothers, 
and a minority only of subordinate bachelors and 
maidens, corresponding to the youthful tutors of the 
colleges and ushers of the English schools" (p. 173).

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



In general, we know of no more illuminating discus- 
sion of the problem of the teaching force in America 
than this chapter, on " The Formal System of 
Education." 

Finally, Dr. Chancellor perceives and declares that 
our present period of compulsory education is inade- 
quate. In the ideal school, " every boy and every girl 
will be kept at school until adolescence has passed its 
climax and character and intelligence have been well 
established" (p. 175) . We should have been glad to 
see much more space given to this subject in a book 
dealing with the theory of education as a whole. 
The vast majority of our children are dismissed from 
school just when the real work of character forma- 
tion begins. We are acting upon the old fallacy 
embodied in the oft-quoted saying, "Give me the 
child until he is twelve, and I care not who has him 
afterwards." Let us, rather, learn wisdom from 
those unequalled educators, the Jesuits, who left the 
boy to others until he was twelve (or thereabouts), 
and then took him in hand, holding him if possible 
until he reached the age of manhood. The means 
of education for the youth who now leave school at 
fourteen must be discovered and put vigorously into 
operation. 

Nothing is more noticeable, in recent educational 
discussion, than the great access of interest in the 
problem of moral training. The world is re- 
awakening to the old truth that the rational end of 
education is character, and that the great problem 
is how to lay hands upon the development not only 
of bodily and mental powers, but also upon the 
directive will. A striking incident in this general 
condition is the case of the California Prize Essays 
on " Moral Training in the Public Schools." About 
two • years ago, announcement was made that a 
citizen of California, who wished his name withheld 
(and who has not yet seen fit to permit his identity 
to be revealed), offered two prizes of $500 and 
$300, respectively, for the best essays on the subject 
mentioned. Some three hundred essays were re- 
ceived by the committee in charge; award of the 
prizes was made, and in further execution of the 
wishes of the donor the best essays were published. 
Besides the two prize essays, three others were chosen 
for this honor. The book containing them is now at 
hand, bearing the title originally announced for the 
essays, " Moral Training in the Public Schools." 

The five writers are as follows, in order of the 
judges' award: Mr. Charles E. Hugh, Principal of 
the Bay School, Oakland, California ; Rev. T. P. 
Stevenson, Philadelphia ; Prof. E. D. Starbuck of 
the University of Iowa ; Mr. Frank Cramer of Palo 
Alto ; and Principal George E. Myers of the 
McKinley Manual Training School, Washington, 
D. C. The book is short, and readable throughout. 
It is surprising to find so little duplication of opinion 
and proposals. Some general ideas, of course, ap- 
pear in all the papers ; but detail and definite 
proposals are completely varied. Perhaps this is 
indicative of the rudimentary state of the problem 



of moral education; doubtless when we have made 
more progress toward scientific knowledge of the 
laws of moral development we shall find much more 
common ground for the pronouncements of experts. 
As space does not permit special review of each of 
these essays, we content ourselves with one or two 
remarks concerning them. Most striking is the unan- 
imous conviction of the urgency of the problem, and 
of our present remissness ; and here, fortunately, most 
thoughtful people will agree. The most interesting 
positive proposal is made by Dr. Stevenson : " Let 
the State teach in her public schools the system of 
morality which is embodied in her own laws, with 
such sanctions as the religious character of the State 
herself supplies " (p. 79). We note with regret that 
no adequate recognition is given to the fact empha- 
sized by Dr. Chancellor, as before noted, that the 
positive formation of character takes place mainly in 
the secondary and not in the elementary period. We 
find in the essays no effective plan for meeting the 
ethical needs of the great mass of children who drop 
out of school before they are fifteen, and no adequate 
treatment of the peculiar problem of the secondary 
school. The essays abound in practical suggestions 
calculated to aid the teacher in making better use of 
the means now at hand in the school, and no teacher 
can afford to neglect a careful reading of the book. 
The thanks of all interested in education are due to 
the generous and modest giver of the funds for the 
prizes and the publication of the essays. 

Two educational books by English writers are in 
our present group. The first, " The Child's Mind, 
its Growth and Training," by W. E. Urwick, M.A., 
we may dispose of in a few words. It seems to 
contain nothing that has not been better said by 
previous writers, such as Kirkpatrick, Rowe, Tracy, 
and especially Tyler. We find in the book ele- 
mentary matter set forth in a complicated and 
difficult style ; in consequence, the reader who is in 
need of such a book will find this one obscure and 
perplexing, while those who can readily understand 
the book do not need to read it. In passing, we 
cannot but marvel at the statement that " Common 
sense will teach every teacher the importance of 
fresh air" (p. 34). Would that this were so, not 
only as regards teachers, but also housekeepers, 
church wardens, and the whole race of janitors ! 

The production of monographs marks an ad- 
vanced stage of the science to which they relate. 
Books on education en gros have been long in vogue, 
and it is good to see a change in such books as Mr. 
M. W. Keating's " Suggestion in Education." The 
work is, as its title indicates, a study in educational 
psychology ; and it is a very thorough and helpful 
one. The writer has uncommon powers of psycho- 
logical description : his account of the subconscious, 
for example, seems to us the best short description 
we have met (p. 143^). He has also in a high 
degree the art of making his exposition vivid and 
interesting without being diffuse, by mingling just 
the right proportions of the concrete and the didactic.

The plan of discussion is clear and logical. In the 
hypnotic state, and in " splitoff selves," we are 
shown the extreme forms of suggestion and dissoci- 
ation ; then we* pass to an examination of suggestion 
in normal waking states. Next come the conditions, 
preliminary and immediate, under which suggestion 
is effective — with constant reference to the teacher's 
task. The remaining four chapters, from the seventh 
to the twelfth, really deal with the influence of sug- 
gestion in the formation of character ; and we know 
of few more fruitful studies of moral education. Of 
peculiar interest are the conclusions drawn from the 
fact that indirect suggestion is always more power- 
ful than direct, owing to the contrariant ideas likely 
to be roused by direct suggestion. Speaking of a 
noted school-book, the author says : " Yet for many 
boys the very title, ' Book of Moral Lessons,' would 
be sufficient to bring up the resolve that under no 
circumstances would any of the moral apothegms 
therein contained be permitted to touch the springs 
of action" (p. 167). The writer points out that 
many popular methods of moral instruction suffer 
from the weakness inherent in the direct form of 
suggestion. He comes to the defence of the classics 
and of Jiard studies in English literature : " The 
harder the technique of the subject, and the more 
it is studied for itself, the more will the conditions 
for indirect moral suggestion be present" (p. 177). 
The whole chapter from which we quote, " Some 
Practical Applications," is of uncommon value to 
the teacher — especially to the teacher of literature, 
in whatever tongue. Both Caesar's Commentaries 
and Tennyson's Odes would be vastly more vital 
and powerful in the school-room if turned by the 
method recommended thi-ough indirect suggestion to 
ethical stimulus and illumination.

If there is any truth (and there most 
^par'^tlT certainly is) in the poet's assertion 

that " self -reverence, self-knowledge, 
self-control, — these three alone lead life to sovereign 
power," it nowhere more clearly demonstrates itself 
than in the domain of parental government. Mr. 
Ernest Hamlin Abbott's pleasant and profitable little 
book "On the Training of Parents" (Houghton) 
illustrates this truth with much shrewdness, humor, 
good sense, and evidence of actual and often perplex- 
ing experience. The obligation resting on parents 
to honor their children, no less than on children to 
honor their parents, is convincingly demonstrated. 
"I sometimes wonder," says the author, "if it is 
really just to lay the Fifth Commandment upon all 
American children. Somehow, there seems to be 
something reciprocal implied in it. If that com- 
mandment is of universal application, it can be con- 
sidered so, I imagine, only on the ground that it 
states a duty owed ultimately not to the parents but 
to the Almighty. Certainly that parent who does 



not respect his children has no personal claim upon 
their honor." Two sentences a little further on strike 
the keynote of the book : " Preliminary to teaching 
children how to obey is the process of learning how 
to command. When a child is intransigent, it is 
worth while to consider whether it is not he that is 
administering the rebuke." A fine capacity for as- 
suming the child's point of view, and also a sense of 
humor, are revealed in the following : " The one 
unescapable part of our children's environment is — 
ourselves. Over them we are always impending. At 
inconvenient times we rise in their way and impede 
their most absorbing occupations. On their excur 
sions into the wilds of fancy it is we who obtrude 
and with philistine complacency drive them back into 
the gross world of wash-basins and table manners. 
Three small boys are busy blasting. One is a work- 
man ; a second is the fuse ; the third is the hole, and 
is about to explode for the sixth time. Who inter- 
rupts with some trivial but insistent remark about 
less noise or clean clothes ? One of us. And the 
worst of it is that we who are so troublesomely recur- 
rent, and who are their source of supplies, seem to 
be incapable of appreciating the delights of becoming 
at will a trolley-car, an alligator, a goblin, or a hole 
in the ground." There is significance in the fact 
that the author is a grandson of that oldtime favorite 
of children, Jacob Abbott, whose numerous and excel- 
lent books include one on " Gentle Measures in the 
Management and Training of the Young."

his researches in the borderlani between physics 
and chemistry. About five years ago he published 
a treatise on cosmical physics, which was recognized 
by astronomers as worthy of high praise. So cor- 
dially was that work received by scientists in general 
that Dr. Arrhenius has developed and explained his 
theories in a popular way in a new work, " Worlds 
in the Making," which has been done into very fair 
English by Dr. H. Boms, and is published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. The book opens with 
a discussion of the present state of the interior of the 
earth, as judged from the phenomena of volcanoes 
and earthquakes ; from which the author concludes 
that the crust cannot be very thick, and that the 
interior core is gaseous. The gas, however, being 
under great pressure, is very viscous, and contains 
much iron and other metals. On the exterior of the 
earth, life is thought to have existed for millions of 
years, and to have a good chance of continuing — 
thanks to the presence of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere — for untold ages to come. The heat 
of the sun, the maintenance of which is commonly 
ascribed to a slow process of contraction, is more 
probably due, our author thinks, to powerful chemi- 
cal reactions, which may maintain the present 
output of light and heat for many thousands of 
millions of years to come. The pressure which

sunlight is now known to exert upon bodies is great 
enough to drive very small particles away from the 
sun itself, just as this force repels the tenuous 
matter in the tails of comets. Many of these par- 
ticles enter our atmosphere, and cause electric and 
magnetic disturbances, among which the aurora 
borealis is to be reckoned. The sun, as it contin- 
ually loses heat, will finally become comparatively 
cool, like the earth ; and while in this state it may 
come into collision with some similar body, thus 
giving rise to a spiral nebulae, from which a new 
solar system may be formed, to repeat the history 
of its predecessor. The evolution of worlds may 
thus "continue in an eternal cycle, in which there 
is neither beginning nor end, and in which life may 
exist and continue forever and undiminished." The 
concluding chapter develops the theory that germs 
of lowly organic life are being continually carried 
away from the earth and other planets into the sea 
of ether, eventually to fertilize other worlds. It is 
to be regretted that neither the author, the trans- 
lator, nor the publisher of this thoughtful and 
stimulating book has provided it with an index ; for 
though the work contains only 230 pages, it is full 
of details many of which will be valuable for pur- 
poses of reference. 

The Comtesse In a third volume of the English 
and ParUin translation of the " Memoirs of the 
the twenties. Comtesse de Boigne " (Scribner) the 
chatty Frenchwoman continues her recollections 
and impressions of persons and events through the 
decade 1820-30, covering the latter part of Louis 
XVIII. 's reign and the whole of that of Charles X., 
with some first-hand accounts of the stirring street 
scenes that madeJhe month of July, 1830, a mem- 
orable one for I^is and for France. As in the 
preceding instalments of this rather gossipy chron- 
icle, men and women of note in French history or 
literature are touched upon at frequent intervals, 
but not, one regrets to find, with very much of 
keen insight or remarkable descriptive power. The 
reader feels little better acquainted with Chateau- 
briand or Talleyrand or Guizot, after reading these 
memoirs than before. In the passing references to 
these and other celebrities there is one mention of 
Cardinal Talleyrand that might, so far as the con- 
text and the appended footnote and the index, too, 
are concerned, tend to deceive or bewUder the un- 
wary reader : he might pause to query whether the 
famous diplomat, the Prince of Benevento, Abbd of 
St. Denis, Agent-General of the Clergy, Bishop of 
Autun, and holder of numerous other ecclesiastical 
benefices and titles, had also received the red hat as 
the crowning recognition of what Mirabeau called 
his infdme conduite. It was, however, the great 
Talleyrand's uncle, Alexandre Ang^lique, who at- 
tained to the cardinalate, though the index identi- 
fies him with the nephew. The publishers' note in 
designating this instalment of the " Memoirs " as 
" the third and final volume," might lead the reader 
to infer that the Comtesse had tired of her task long 



before her hand was palsied by age — she lived to be 
eighty-five, or thirty-six years after the last events 
recorded in her third volume. As a matter of fact, 
the reminiscences were continued, we know not to 
what date, but a fourth volume has been edited for 
publication in the original, and will soon appear, if it 
is not already issued. A long chapter, describing 
the Duchess of Berry's unsuccessful attempt to 
create a revolution in favor of her son, the Count of 
Chambord, was printed last month in the " Revue 
des Deux Mondes." Those who have become inter- 
ested in the translated memoirs will hope for still 
another volume in English.

a mind that by Mr. Cliiiord W. Beers, of his 

found itself. experiences as a patient in several 

asylums for the insane is well maintained from 
cover to cover of his book — "A Mind That Found 
Itself" (Longmans). As a human document, it 
should contribute effectively to a better under- 
standing of what insanity is and of the treatment 
it requires. It is an autobiographical narrative 
dealing with a phase of human experience that cries 
imperatively for- care and insight. The distrust 
that surrounds one whose mental health has been 
lost is difficult to overcome. We cannot easily look 
upon it as illness, but rather as dethronement of all 
that is vitally human, a disorganization hardly to 
be recovered from. No reader of Mr. Beers's nar- 
rative can fail to be impressed with the underlying 
community of thought and feeling that remains 
during the disturbed period, and requires for its 
ministration the same type of sympathetic attention 
that facilitates all varieties of convalescence. The 
psychological interest concerns itself with the inside 
view of insanity here recorded with close fidelity, 
and with an imusual ability of the recovered mind 
to rehearse in sane recollection the disturbed experi- 
ences. These were typically violent, and yet devel- 
oped about a few fundamental delusions, themselves 
subject to the oscillations of morbid depressed 
suspicion and grandiloquent elation. The other 
interest is humanitarian, and takes the form of a 
fervent protest against the brutal violence of attend- 
ants and the abusive mis-handling of unsympathetic 
and uncomprehending physicians. It is hardly 
conceivable that in this day and generation such 
practices as this narrative recounts should be so 
widespread. In the presence of such possibilities, 
the fear of impending insanity would be more than 
equalled by the dread of such abusive treatment. 
The plea is for the principle of non-restraint, — a 
principle that has proved its value wherever honestly 
and appreciatively introduced. The book naturally 
carries with it, in spite of the critical care of friendly 
revisers, much of the intensity of an irritable tem- 
perament ; yet with ample allowance for this trait, 
the account rings true, and should do much to 
enlighten the public in regard to what is needed in 
the way of practical reforms for the work of minis- 
tering wisely to minds diseased.

William Penn" (Dutton) that "the twentieth century 
still waits for a biography which will not only deal 
with Penn the Quaker and politician, but Penn the 
man"; and such a biography she essays to furnish. 
But it is only a few years ago that Mr. Sydney G. 
Fisher gave us his excellent work on "The True 
William Penn," a more detailed and intimate pic- 
ture than Mrs. Grant has succeeded in producing, 
and one that bears evidence of greater study and 
care in its preparation. As an indication of Mrs. 
Grant's too little effort to exclude from her book all 
that is insufficiently authentic, we quote from her 
preface : "My thanks are due ... to Dugald Stuart, 
Esq., for allowing me to reproduce his interesting 
original portrait of William Penn " — as if this 
were a hitherto unpublished and an undoubtedly 
authentic likeness of the man. On the contrary, 
prints of this idealized picture of young Penn in 
shining armor and with flowing locks — painted no 
one knows when or by whom — are common 
enough, taken both from the Stuart original and 
from the copy of the latter in the possession of the 
Pennsylvania Historical Society. Moreover, its 
striking unlikeness to other portraits of Penn, and 
especially to the Bevan carving in ivory which, by 
good contemporary testimony, is a lifelike repre- 
sentation of the man, makes it the least suitable 
figure to place as a frontispiece to a volume pur- 
porting to give the real WUliam Penn and no other. 
Mrs. Grant tells her story pleasantly, and throws 
about the events of her great ancestor's life a good 
deal of the historic framework that such a narrative 
requires ; but apart from the use she has made of a 
few hitherto unpublished letters, she cannot be said 
to have produced an original work or one that fills 
any aching void in literature. Her literary style 
would be improved by more careful attention to 
punctuation : she overworks the comma, inserting 
it between two complete sentences where a full stop 
is called for, and even using it between the subject 
and the predicate of a very short and simple sen- 
tence. The genealogical tables are useful, and the 
large clear print of the book is beyond praise.

ofpsvchoioav. the flavor of expectant mystery. In 
some measure, this wondering anticipation is sug- 
gestive, and possibly is a survival, of the attitude 
toward the mediaeval wielder of the black art. 
To those thus disposed, science is a fairy who 
bestows marvellous gifts — electric lights and wire- 
less telegraphy, anti-toxins and seedless oranges, to 
say nothing of automobiles and air-ships. Mental 
science is to bring like marvels and yet more won- 
derful results, such as telepathic communications, 
thought-waves, the reading of the future, the unseen 
moving of tables, and trance states overflowing with 



revelation, to say nothing of communication with 
the departed and the cure of all iUs (including sin 
and poverty) by absent treatment. Reasoning is at 
best an uncertain art, and with analogy as a guide 
the popular vision is often led by a myopic leader. 
Yet it is well to recognize that the interest in mental 
functions and abnormalities is sound and deserves 
cultivation. It is on the whole fortunate that one 
who writes for the people on "The Riddle of Per- 
sonality" should present so valid a perspective of 
what is going on as does Mr. H. Addington Bruce 
in his book with this title (Moffat, Yard & Co. )• It 
is true that material of the most various purport is 
confusingly set side by side, and that the reader is 
likely to carry away a wholly misleading notion of 
what psychologists are really interested in. The 
emphasis on the "riddle " of things is wholly out of 
proportion to the accounts of what we know of per- 
sonality and its vicissitudes. The man of science 
profoundly regrets that the public asks and absorbs 
this kind of a book, instead of a popularization of 
what psychologists are really studying; but such 
being the case, he takes what comfort he can in 
the fact that the presentation is temperate and not 
extravagant, and he finds further comfort in the 
guidance offered by the author to prospective 
students, who, if they follow it, may find the path 
toward an understanding of personality, not as a 
mystery but as a profound natural development.

Although it is not free from errors that one does 
not look for in the writings of a distinguished Berlin 
professor, it delights the reader from time to time by 
its felicitous summaries of complex situations. The 
attitude of sympathetic observer, which Dr. Lenz 
assumes, often results also in well-balanced interpre- 
tations of Napoleon's motives and plans, impossible 
to those who are always hunting for evidences of 
Satanic intrigue. But if Dr. Lenz is not shocked 
by the spectacle of brutal exercise of power (and 
no Bismarckian can well be), he is not indifferent 
to British aggressiveness. He appears to accept the 
Napoleonic explanation as to why the approach of 
peace generally was found to be a mirage. It was 
not merely the outbreak of war in 1803 that England 
was responsible for, but the seizure of Spain was 
rendered inevitable by the turn of British policy 
indicated in King George's speech from the throne 
in January, 1808. The best part of Dr. Lenz's 
biography is the chapter on Corsica, which delineates 
the growth of Napoleon's character up to the siege 
of Toulon. From the evident attempt to penetrate 
the secret of his development, one expects that this 
dominant thought will be kept in the foreground 
during the treatment of the later career also ; but 
here we find events, rather than the hero's moral 
or mental attitude, of chief interest to the author.

Dr. Lenz carefully analyzes the remains of Napo- 
leon's early literary efPorts, especially the essay for 
the prize offered by the Lyons Academy, in which 
he discovers a theory of the state that is already 
" essentially that of the ruler." Napoleon was then 
a young man of ideals intensely cherished. The 
danger, writes Dr. Lenz, was that his ideal world 
should reveal itself as a world of illusion, and that 
" his thinly disguised melancholy, grown intensified, 
should lead him to despise his ideals." This danger, 
the author intimates, had become a reality, partly as 
a result of the factional struggles in Corsica, before 
the period of his astonishing success began. 

In memory Scholarship is the chief pride of a

Harper. piece of scholarly work. President 

Harper of the University of Chicago was a scholar 
in the field of Semitic studies. His colleagues and 
confrhres in this large expanse have prepared and 
published, under the editorial supervision of Profes- 
sors Robert Francis Harper of Chicago, George F. 
Moore of Harvard, and Francis Brown of Union 
Theological Seminary, two sumptuous volumes of 
learned essays. Twenty-six of the leading Semitic 
scholars in the United States have each contributed 
a scientific treatise on some theme in which he is a 
specialist. These discussions cover a wide range of 
topics. Several of them are careful textual studies 
of some of the books of the Old Testament, and 
present the criticus apparaticus for a detailed 
exegesis of those books. Some of the papers are 
translations of early Sumerian inscriptions belong- 
ing to long ages before the Christian era, and reveal 
to us the fact that scholars are to-day masters of 
a language which a few years ago was practically 
inscrutable. There is no field of scholastic investi- 
gation in which greater strides have been made in 
the last quarter-century than in that represented 
by these researches. They touch all the South- 
western Asiatic continent, from the most ancient 
known dates, approximately 5000 B. C, down to the 
present day. The Assyrian and Arabic empires, 
with all that they meant for those times, are the 
objects of our investigators. No more fitting and 
enduring monument could be erected to the late 
President of the University of Chicago than these 
two noble volumes of scholarly treatises. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The University of California inaugurates its economics 
series of publications with a huge work, by Mr. Wesley 
C. Mitchell, on " Gold, Prices, and Wages under the 
Greenback Standard." It makes a volume of over six 
hundred pages, crammed with statistical tables and 
charts. Such a pace as is here set for the academic 
monograph will be hard to follow. 

In preparing her volume of " More Modem Mono- 
logues," Miss Marjorie Benton Cooke has worked, if 
possible, more successfully than in her earher collection, 



the vein of humorous character-study which she has 
made almost her own. We are particularly taken with 
the group of three heroines — Ada, Shaw, and Ibsen — 
who come at the end of the volume. They are trifles, 
but amazingly clever, although perhaps no more so than 
many of the other studies. The Dramatic Publishing 
Co., Chicago, sends us this book. 

Professor Clarence S. Hamilton's " Outlines of Musi- 
cal History," published by the Oliver Ditson Co., is a 
concise treatise for both the student and the general 
reader. It has many illustrations in musical notation, 
besides portraits and other illustrative material. It is 
an excellent little book, fully abreast of modem musical 
scholarship. 

M. Richard Waddington's " La Guerre de Sept Ans : 
Histoire Diplomatique et Militaire" has reached its 
fourth volume, now published by MM. Firmin-Didot & 
Cie. This volume covers the events of 1760-61, — the 
period of the death-agony of the French in Canada and 
the fruitless efforts of Choiseul to bring about an early 
peace. Several important maps are included in this 
section of the work. 

A new edition of Dr. E. W. Scripture's " Thinking, 
Feeling, and Doing" (Putnam) has recently appeared. 
This popularization of some of the data of modern 
psychology appeals to a legitimate clientele; but it 
would make its appeal as effectively and more legiti- 
mately were it divested of its more sensational and 
tactless illustrations, both pictorial and linguistic. The 
occasion of a new edition might well have effected this 
improvement. 

The " Cambridge Poets " now number an even score 
of volumes, having been brought to that number by the 
" Spenser " which Professor R. E. Neil Dodge has edited 
for Messrs. Houghton, Miffiin & Co. The editor has 
worked long and arduously in the preparation of his 
text, which is the result (except for a few poems) of a 
double collation of the standard (mostly first) edi- 
tions. It is not easy to get the whole of Spenser within 
the limits of a single volume, and it takes nearly eight 
hundred of the two-columned " Cambridge " pages to 
do it. All the special features, both editorial and typo- 
graphical, which fit this series so admirably for the use 
of readers and students alike are once more exemplified 
in this noble tome. 

" Corpus Schwenckfeldianorum, I." — this is the im- 
posing title of a heavy quarto of more than seven 
hiuidred pages. Both volume and title become even 
more imposing when we learn that the complete 
" Corpus " wUl fill no less than seventeen such tomes. 
The origin of the work is the Schwenckfelder Church 
of Norristown, Pennsylvania, but it comes to us by way 
of Leipzig, bearing the imprint of Messrs. Breitkbpf 
und Hartel. The editing of the work, on the other 
hand, hails from the Hartford Theological Semmary, 
being in the hands of Messrs. Chester David Hartranft, 
Otto Bemhard Schlutter, and Elmer Ellsworth Schultz 
Johnson. We are informed that upwards of forty 
thousand dollars have been expended in collecting the 
material for this colossal publication; how much more 
will be expended upon its manufacture we do not ven- 
ture to estimate. The volume now in print is devoted 
to "A Study of the Earliest Letters of Caspar Schwenck- 
feld von Ossig " — for such was the full name of the 
founder of the communion which remains as the real 
monument of his life and work. As a contribution to 
the religious history of the Reformation period this 
publication must prove a work of great importance.

spelling of the text, by Mr. W. G. Boswell-Stone, is a 
new volume in the " Shakespeare Library " of Messrs. 
Duffield & Co.

which Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. will publish this 
month.

W. Higginson, and " The Religion of a Democrat," by 
Professor Charles Zueblin.

edited by members of the English Department at Yale. 

Dr. James H. Hyslop is desirous of securing material 
for an account of the life of Dr. Richard Hodgson and 
his work in Psychical Research. The loan of personal

519 West 149th St., New York. 

From the Oliver Ditson Company we have a vol- 
ume of " Thirty Preludes for the Organ," edited by 
Mr. H. Clough-Leighter. One finds among the com- 
posers represented such men as Chopin, Goimod, and 
Wagner, although most of the names are of writers 
chiefly associated with the organ. 

With a view to the completion of the Memoirs of 
the late Carl Schurz, all persons having unpublished

Ostrovsky's "The Storm" and Strindberg's "The 
Father," respectively translated by Miss Constance

in new editions by Messrs. John W. Luce & Co., who 
seem to have taken over the series of " Modern Plays " 
formerly published by Mr. Charles H. Sergei. 

Herr Bjornson's great pedagogical novel, " Det Flager 
i Byen og paa Havnen," is now added to the imiform 
edition of the author's fiction published by the Macmillan 
Co. Mr. Cecil Fairfax is the translator, and the un- 
translatable title becomes " The Heritage of the Kurts." 
Like " In God's Way," this work fills two volumes. 

Two volumes not heretofore announced, to be issued 
shortly by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., are " Canadian 
Types of the Old Regime," by Professor Charles W. 
Colby of McGill University ; and a collection of addresses 
and editorials by Professor Fabian Franklin, late of Johns 
Hopkins University and sometime editor of the Balti- 
more " News." 

Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick, who will be pleasantly remem- 
bered for her two novels, " The Beryl Stone " and " The 
Kinsman," has turned to a very different field in her 
latest book, " Home Life in Germany," which is to be 
published this Spring. Although of English birth, Mrs. 
Sidgwick's parents were German, and she knows both 
countries equally well. 

After a year of secrecy regarding the authorship of 
" As the Hague Ordains : Journal of a Russian Prisoner's 
Wife in Japan," the publishers (Holt) now state that 
Miss Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a resident of Washing- 
ton, a prominent member of the National Geographic

responsible for the volume. 

J. B. Lippincott Company have postponed until early 
Fall the publication of " Richard the Third," edited by

and its completion is awaited with interest.

of Wisconsin " has just been extended by three impor-

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



Schaffner; " The Labor History of the Cripple Creek 
District," by Mr. Beujamin McKie Rastall; and "The 
Financial History of Wisconsin," by Dr. Raymond 
Vincent Phelan. To the philological series has been 
added a work on " German Literatm-e in American Mag- 
azines prior to 1846," by Dr. Scott Holland Goodnight.

lish a book entitled " In the Woods and on the Shore," 
by Richard D. Ware, a young attorney of Boston, with 
illustrations by Charles Livingston Bull. Mr. Ware's 
book contains a record of several seasons of hunting and 
fishing in Newfoimdland and New Brunswick, along the 
shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the eastern 
coast of Massachusetts. 

In response to many requests from writers for an 
extension of time in their prize novel competition, the 
Outing Publishing Company has decided to postpone 
the closing of the competition until August 1, 1908, It 
wiU be recalled that the prize consists of $1000, to be 
awarded for the best MS. of a story by a new writer, 
sent in by the time indicated. The final selection of 
the winning story will be made by competent readers 
not connected with the Outing Company. 

« The Passing of Morocco," by Mr. Frederick Moore, 
author of " The Balkan Trail," is announced for publi-

" Times " during the recent outbreak in the Balkan 
peninsula, and last August went to Morocco as special 
correspondent of the London " Westminster Gazette." 
His new book will be illustrated from photographs, and 
will be issued simultaneously in England and America. 

A new book by Mr. Frederic Harrison, entitled " My 
Alpine Jubilee," is announced by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. Mr. Harrison was the guest of the Alpine Club 
at their recent Jubilee, and at their suggestion he con- 
sented to collect some pieces that he had written on 
mountaineering from his own experience, which long 
preceded the origin of the club. These are embodied 
in the present volume, and Mr. Harrison has prefixed 
to them some letters which he wrote to his wife and 
daughter during a visit to Switzerland last year. 

The next meeting of the recently-organized Missis- 
sippi Valley Historical Association will be held at Lake 
Minnetonka, Minn., in June. The object of this Asso- 
ciation, as set forth in its Constitution, is " to promote 
historical study and research and to secure cooperation 
between the historical societies and the departments of 
history of the Mississipi Valley." It is to be hoped 
that the organization will have the cooperation of every 
historical student in the Middle West and South. There 
is no admission fee, and the annual dues are but $1. 
Mr. Clarence S. Paine, of Lincoln, Neb., is Secretary 
and Treasurer of the Association. 

Mr. Frederic G. Mather, author of several Revolu- 
tionary monographs, has collected all the original docu- 
ments pertaining to the band of refugees who, after the 
battle of Long Island had been won by the British, on 
August 27, 1776, fled from the island to Connecticut. 
These documents are soon to be reprinted, together with a 
brief historical sketch detailing the circumstances of the 
flight. Mr. Mather wishes to determine, as far as 
possible, the final place of residence of each settler, and 
the names and residences of his living descendants, if he 
has any. Persons having information on these points 
will do Mr. Mather a favor by communicating with him 
at 164 Fairfield Avenue, Stamford, Conn.

Three Books Worth Reading and Keeping 



The Tragedy of Russia in Pacific Asia 

By FREDERICK McCORMICK 
Numerous illustrations, maps, etc. Two volumes. $6.00 net. 

THIS work is of peculiar value to American readers, inasmuch as it is the first book ranking as history ever written 
by an American for his fellow countrymen on a great international struggle. Furthermore it is the best book 
on the subject that has yet appeared, being the most authoritative and the most comprehensive. All the important 
happenings from the investment of Port Arthur to the last of the land battles were actually witnessed by the author, 
and his pen pictures of the Russians in bivouac, battle, and retreat are wonderful in their vividness and realism. 



Big Game at Sea 

By CHARLES FREDERICK HOLDER 

Fully illustrated. Large 12mo. Price $2.00 net. 

The deep sea as a hunting ground is rapidly finding 
favor with sportsmen. There the game is plentiful, the 
season always open, and the hunting, if conducted in the 
spirit of true sportsmanship, perilous enough to satisfy the 
most daring. 

Mr. Holder is an ardent follower of the sport, and the 
stories told of his adventures while capturing, mostly with 
rod and line, the monsters of the deep are as fascinating 
and absorbing as the most entertaining fiction. 



The sport of Bird Study 

By HERBERT K. JOB 

Very fully illustrated with photographs from life. 

Square 12mo. Price $2.00 net. 

The author of this book is a naturalist of many years' 
standing, and has studied and photographed the birds of 
the Eastern United States for upwards of a decade. His 
object in this volume is to interest everyone who loves nature 
and the outdoors, in our birds, believing that it is only neces- 
sary to know them in order to enjoy and protect them. 

The book is in story form and tells how the author and 
a boy companion made the study of birds afield a fascinating 
and exciting athletic sport, telling also how others can get 
the same pleasure out of it.

288 THE DIAL. [May 1, 1908. 



NEH^ mission for the preface of a hook has been discovered 
by the brilliant author of " iAn ^American Student in France." 
He finds it a convenient repository for a secret; for we all know 
that no one ever reads a preface I On that supposition tAbhe Klein ingen- 
uously confides to the Preface of his new book his own secret: that it was 
not written by a student of Chicago; that its author is too old to go to 
school, — except to teach there; and that the name of the city where he lives 
is Paris. Perhaps the reader will not only pardon the disguise so can- 
didly admitted, but also envy the fortunate students under such a teacher. 

An American Student 
in France 

(La Decouverte du Vieux Monde par un Etudiant de Chicago) 

By ABBE FELIX KLEIN, of the Catholic University of Paris 

The author has indeed discovered, or, if not discovered, at least invested 
with fresh charm, the Old World as epitomized in the bright life of the 
city to which all good Americans go eventually. His hero is a young 
American, who, with memories of college lectures on French history and 
art fresh in his mind, is peculiarly fit to appreciate what he sees. And the 
people with whom he comes into contact show him all the various phases 
of Old World life. From Bernard de Pujol, urbane and witty, he learns 
the Royalist's view of the present government; the grave young Abbe 
sheds much light on the momentous Church and State intricacy, and his 
thorough modernity comes somewhat as a surprise to the hero. Yet all 
his new friends offer their information, not patronizingly, but with that 
lightness of tone, that indescribable play of French irony which has its 
thrust good-naturedly now at French, now at American prejudice. 

" The scenes which he visits in various parts of France are described with care, and 
historic and literary associations are touched upon. The author is well qualified to make 
such a book both instructive and entertaining.'^ — Springfield Republican. 
" The serious tourist will find Abbe Klein's book illuminating on many points, while his 
kindly, tolerant personality shines through his pages.'' — Chicago Record-Herald.

Professor A. Lawrence LowelFs important work 
The Government of England 



The work is one of the most important contributions to the study of political history published in years. It is a 
comprehensive survey of the political system of a country whose institutions are more notable than those of any 
other state but Rome. The basis of political power in England has shifted gradually from the monarch to the 
territorial aristocracy and thence to the mass of the people. The book is therefore a study of popular government 
working under a Parliamentary system, and portrays the results as manifested in various forms of public activity.

A DRA MATIC FEAST. 

Just seven months ago we made some com- 
ment upon the enterprise of Mr. Donald 
Robertson in organizing a company of players, 
and planning a series of dramatic performances 
representative of the best classical and contem- 
porary dramatic authorship. We expressed 
confidence in his ability, and believed that he 
would prove successful in doing for the cul- 
tivated Chicago public what the amateurish 
management of the ill-starred New Theatre of 
the year before had attempted to do, and failed. 
The event has justified our prediction, and Mr. 
Robertson's Company has now closed its eight 
months' season with an artistic record in which 
all concerned may take just pride. His work 
has been by far the most interesting done by 
anybody during the past year in the local the- 
atrical world, and it has a more than local 
significance, for it has transformed into a partly- 
accomplished fact what was before only the 
dream of a few idealists, namely, the creation 
of a theatre for the production of the best 
examples of the literary drama. 

This is an expression which we are not afraid 
to use, despite the flippancy of newspaperdom 
and the scorn of commercialized theatricalism ; 
we use it simply as a convenient phrase for 
describing all the works in dramatic form which 
it is possible to fit to stage conditions, and which 
are at the same time good literature, worth 
printing in books and reading in the library. 
It is obvious that the phrase includes all of the 
world's dramatic classics and a considerable 
portion of the contemporary product as well. 
If it includes practically none of the pieces which 
audiences eagerly flock to our theatres to see, so 
much the worse for our theatres. That the 
phrase is comprehensive enough to include also 
many works written for the reader alone is not 
to the point. Again we say, so much the worse 
for our theatres, but this time in the sense that 
their unfriendly attitude toward plays which 
are also works of literary art has been the direct 
cause of the divorce which has long existed be- 
tween literature and the stage. Most English 
writers of the past fifty years who have cared 
to work in the dramatic form have been absolved 
from the technical obligations which that form 
imposes by the knowledge that literary work, 



294 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



however good it might be as such, was certain 
to find scant favor in the eyes of the managerial 
tribe. Why go to the trouble of adapting 
scenes and situations to the needs of the spec- 
tator, when no spectator was likely to be pro- 
vided? The managers, sacrificing everything 
else to sensational effect and shallow entertain- 
ment, have had their logical reward. Rejecting 
the drama of ideas and insight and poetical 
diction, they have fed, and forced the public 
to feed also, upon the husks offered them by 
second-rate play rights. Unwilling to accept 
the terms essential to any enduring compact 
between the man of letters and the stage, they 
have degraded the theatre from its nobler func- 
tion, and reduced it to show and artifice and 
superficiality. 

This exile of literature from the theatre, 
where it has a prescriptive if not a divine right 
to reign supreme, has long been a crying scandal. 
Much hard pioneer work must be done before 
the exile is ended, and Mr. Robertson, who is 
engaged in doing just this kind of work, should 
be made to feel that his labors are appreciated. 
What uphill work it has thus far been, he alone 
could adequately tell us. The outsider has seen 
some of his difficulties, but not all of them. 
The meagre support given to his enterprise by 
a heedless public has been patent to all obser- 
vation, as has also been the ignorance and worse 
which has characterized the accoimts of his work 
in the daily press. With one honorable excep- 
tion, the newspaper writers who are supposed to 
keep us informed about what is going on in the 
theatrical world, have dealt with this remarkable 
work in a spirit of indifference at the best, and 
at the worst of malice mingled with mendacity. 
They even went so far as to say — to take one 
glaring example — that a certain play produced 
by Mr. Robertson — one of the noblest of its 
kind, and one given many times with great suc- 
cess in the country of its origin — had never 
before been performed, and was never even in- 
tended by its author for stage-production ! Upon 
this precious premise was based an argument for 
the impracticality and general futility of the 
whole enterprise, and the general ear of the pub- 
lic was thus grossly abused. 

Mr. Robertson, fortunately, offers a rare com- 
bination of the idealist with the man of practical 
resourcefulness. It is this union of qualities 
which has carried him through his first season 
in the face of the discouragements offered by 
slender support, recreant reviewing, malicious 
misrepresentation, the difficulty of finding suit- 
able quarters, and the defection of some of his 



most trusted associates. Opposed to these ob- 
stacles he has had to offer only his own enthu- 
siasm and tenacity of purpose, his own versatile 
abilities as an actor together with his power to 
train his company to artistic imity of effect, 
and his readiness to seize upon every available 
point of vantage. With anything less than this 
equipment, he would long ago have come to 
grief. Having it, he has completed one season 
without material failure and with a highly cred- 
itable record of artistic success, and now, with 
brightening prospects, he is planning next 
year's work. That the sapling which has thus 
weathered its first storms may grow into a sturdy 
tree must be the wish of everyone who has the 
real interests of our stage at heart. 

During the season of a little more than eight 
months, Mr. Robertson's company has given us 
seventeen plays, with two or three exceptions 
works of established character. They have been 
presented in nearly two hundred afternoon and 
evening performances, mostly in Chicago and its 
suburbs, although about twenty-five of the per- 
formances have been given in outlying towns of 
Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. The list of 
the plays is of great interest. Four of them 
have been one-act pieces, given either in groups 
or as curtain-raisers. These four are Lamb's 
" The Intruding Widow," Browning's " In a 
Balcony," M. Maeterlinck's " L'Intruse," and 
Mr. Cale Young Rice's " A Night in Avignon." 
The thirteen longer works are the following : 
Moli^re's " L'Avare," M. Pailleron's " La 
Souris " (" The Triumph of Youth "), Goldoni's 
" Un Curioso Accidente," Giacosa's " Come le 
Foglie," Calderon's " Nadie Fie Su Secreto " 
(" Keep Your Own Secret," in FitzGerald's 
translation), Senor Echegaray's " O Locura o 
Santidad," Gogol's " Revizor," Herr Haupt- 
mann's " Friedensfest, ' Ibsen's " Rosmers- 
hohn," Herr Bjornson's " Sigurd Slembe," Part 
II., and " En Hanske " ("A Gauntlet"), Brown- 
ing's " A Blot in the 'Scutcheon," and a newplay 
entitled " The Law," by Mrs. Solomon Sturges, 
an American writer. 

Such a list as this fairly justifies the caption 
given to the present article. The many thou- 
sands of persons who have witnessed these 
performances have had a unique opportunity 
to become acquainted with such a series of 
masterpieces as has never before been brought 
to the playgoers' attention, either in England 
or America, in any single season under a single 
management. Only three of the thirteen plays 
have ever before, as" far as we know, been pro- 
duced anywhere in the English language. And 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



295 



the list is admirably representative of the various 
aspects of the modem drama. From such great 
classical writers as Calderon, Moli^re, and 
Goldoni, to the men who are the chief sponsors 
for the modern movement, the gamut has run, 
making it possible to view three centuries of the 
drama in historical perspective. Noteworthy 
also is the balanced cosmopolitanism of the list, 
which includes plays from the six most import- 
ant continental literatures of culture, besides 
examples of- English and American authorship. 
Those who have been privileged to watch this 
experiment at close range have much cause to 
be grateful to the man whose determined and 
practical idealism has borne this fine fruit. 

It is a satisfaction to be able to state that eco- 
nomical management has made Mr. Robertson's 
enterprise self-supporting for the season now 
ended, and that, with brightening prospects, 
his work will be resumed next autumn. It has 
gained a foothold, and its continuance is prac- 
tically assured. Therein is matter for congrat- 
ulation to all concerned, and it is with unfeigned 
pleasure that we mingle our own congratulations 
with the rest. 



THE INTOXICATION OF WORDS. 



Some years ago I was sitting one evening on my 
porch, while a little distance away two colored coal- 
heavers were resting from their labors. They had 
the power to talk of Heaven and Hell ; and one of 
them discoursed in this wise : " What 's a darkey 
want to go to Heaven for ? All he have to do there 
is sit up in the cold, cold night, enumerating the 
stars an' counting the constellations of the Golden 
Host ; an' then when the morning breaks he have 
to go down to the bottom of the garden an' draw up 
millions an' millions of buckets of water for the 
Children of Israel." 

I quote this speech because I think it affords a 
good example of the spell which mere words exercise 
over mankind. The most ignorant of men feel 
their power. Anyone who has listened to a darkey 
preacher of the old style can recall similar instances 
of unthinkable combinations of language which yet 
often had a touch of inspiration in them. Dry den 
confessed that a rhyme often helped him to a line ; 
and the negro speakers, laying violent hands upon 
fine words, sometimes found ideas tumbling in with 
them. More usually, however, they were like the 
South Sea Islanders who parted a chest of dress 
clothes among them, so that one wore a pair of 
breeches around his neck, another a coat belted 
around him like a skirt, and a third had a high hat 
perched upon his hairy horns. 

Words are not only for use — they are for adorn- 
ment. They are not only the counters and coins 



with which we transact our business — they are the 
jewels in which we array ourselves for dignity or 
pleasure. Properly used, they have the gleam and 
sparkle and color of gems, and they are as inde- 
structible. Genius showers on her kings barbaric 
pearl and gold. 

Words are like deep-laden freighters plying 
between the shores of the abstract and the concrete 
worlds. They bring in their holds the spices, the 
webs of woven air, the fabrics of dream, from the 
one land, and take in return the corn and cattle and 
iron of the other. There are, properly, only two 
great systems of philosophy — the system which 
makes all existence thought, as in Plato's Theory 
of Ideas, the Maya or Illusion of the Hindoos, the 
Realism of the Schoolmen ; and the system which 
finds nothing in nature but matter and the sensa- 
tional experience of it. Words are the common 
carriers of both of these conceptions of life, as far, 
at least, as they are transferred from mind to mind. 
Whether the Idea and the Thing are one, and if so 
which it is that is the one, are questions not likely 
to be decided. But words are incarnations of the 
thought and symbols of the thing. In the hands of 
men entirely gi-eat, they are so much alive as to 
suggest the idea that the universe itself and all that 
is therein may be merely the written language of 
the Master Being of all. 

It is when words are new to us, when they sound 
to our ears like shells reverberant of varied oceans, 
when they glitter to our eyes with pearly opalescence, 
that their power is greatest. They are the spells 
which vitalize the magnificent make-believe of child- 
hood. " That is a castle ! " the boy cries ; and to 
the eyes of himself and his playfellows the old 
hair-cloth sofa swells out into barbican and battle- 
ments and keep. The cupboard is a robber's cave, 
and jackets and pinafores become the panoply of 
knights or the garb of pirates. India is in one 
corner of the room and Hudson Bay in another. 
Prevailing poets, their undoubting minds believe the 
magic wonders that they speak. The child's mind 
opens and expands to language more rapidly than 
to actual experience. It is, as a rule, dull to natural 
scenery ; it does not readily grasp human character ; 
it disdains the ordinary business of life. But out of 
words it weaves an enchanted world in which it 
moves in absolute disinterestedness. There is no shock 
of disillusion, because one experience in this world 
is just as good as another. There is as much excite- 
ment in losing a golden treasiu-e as in finding it. 
Being a hunted robber is as good fun as being a 
noble knight. Life is a delightful dream, and words 
are the substance out of which its hills and valleys 
and palaces and towns and people and pageants are 
created. 

Undoubtedly the artist's mood is the child's mood. 
Literature deals with much else besides art. It 
moralizes, it teaches, it satirizes, it exhorts. To 
the writer whose predominant tendency is for any 
of these functions, language is mainly a vehicle of 
thought, a medium of communication with mankind.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



It is not necessarily more sensuous or self-existent 
than mathematical formulae. But the pure artist 
merely dreams and creates ; and to him words are 
the most real of all real things, because he sees his 
visions rise out of them into existence, as clouds rise 
out of the sea. Not for him is it to doubt the truth 
of his word-embodied beings ; not for him to make 
any difference between the children of his brain — 
to separate them into sheep and goats, to love and 
laud his good characters and hate his bad. He 
regards them all alike, so long as they can alike be 
clad in the vivid vesture of words. If he has any 
preference, it is for his dark or parti-colored projec- 
tions of sin and passion, because those are capable 
of more power and picturesqueness than his virtuous 
flock. On the other hand, the writer who is half 
artist and half moralist is continually in doubt as to 
the reality of his own creations. He is apt to speak 
of them contemptuously as puppets ; he rips his dolls 
open to show us the sawdust inside. He pursues 
his evil personages with implacable fury. His 
purpose is mainly moral ; and as he uses words only 
to convey his ideas, so he uses characters only to 
enforce them. All this may amount to very great 
work, but it is something quite different, and usually 
is inferior to the real artist's dream-like disinterested 
reproduction of the world as fresh as on creation's 
day. 

As words are most potent to children who are 
just learning them, so they are most pregnant with 
magic in the youth of a race when it is just forming 
its language. The discovery that things can be 
named, that we can pack the riches of the world 
into our minds, that we can in a way overrun and 
possess the earth by turning it into sign and sound, 
always intoxicates. And in the early stages of a 
nation's growth, this discovery is very widely made. 
Then a poet addresses an audience of poets. Then 
brief and pregnant verse is preferred to dull and 
diluted prose. Then the images of life do not have 
to be spelled out and explained and illustrated and 
made visible by material objects, but hints and 
glimpses flash them at once into the minds of auditors 
themselves inflamed with creating fury. 

The one sensuous quality which inheres in words is 
sound. All their other powers to enlighten, to move, 
to intoxicate, depend on their arbitrary meanings, 
which we have to learn, on the way they are put to- 
gether by those who handle them, and on the associa- 
tions which they acquire. And though there is a large 
class of words, in every language, which give an 
echo to the sense, and sound like what they indicate, 
and though there is a still larger number of words 
of innately noble and mighty sound, yet in the main 
the delightfulness of words uttered in conjunction 
depends upon the skill of him who uses them. 
Alliteration, the repetition or contrast of vowel 
sounds, rhyme, assonance, the movement of words 
in quantity, accent, rhythm, measure, or the fixed 
employment of so many syllables or accents in a 
line, — these are the sensuous resources of language, 
to which, in great part, it owes its intoxicating and 



memorable triumphs. They are really resources of 
verse ; for though prose can use some of them, it is 
seldom bettered by so doing. 

Alliteration is the most common means used to 
give distinction to moulded words, and its use ranges 
from the popular proverb up to the elaborate schemes 
of Milton or Swinburne. It is like the marking 
time, or keeping step, of a group of soldiers, which 
differentiates their movement from the vague shuffle 
of the crowd. It is apt to become an offence when 
too much insisted on ; and the greatest masters keep 
it half hidden, like a delicate chain thridding through 
and binding together their jeweled words. Milton 
usually has two or three sets of alliteration going at 
one time. Vowels have their alliteration as well as 
consonants, and it is upon their reduplication or sharp 
dissonances that much of the music of verse arises. 
Some poets, with all their care, can only bring forth 
light tinkling melodies ; while with others the vowels 
sound out rich and full like the notes of mighty bells 
or lordly organ-pipes. The principle of repetition 
of sound comes out most completely in rhyme and 
assonance, where, being undisguised, it is used to 
bind lines together and separate them from the con- 
text. Beyond the couplet and the quatrain, rhyme 
weakens sound by diluting it. I think such excess 
of rhyme weakens meaning, too, by a sort of subtle 
sympathy ; so that the regular sonnet and the Spen- 
serian stanza, while elegant and atrial, are less 
forcible and objective than simpler forms of verse. 
The principle of repetition is also involved in rhythm 
and measure, with their fixed use of quantity or 
accent ; but here it is the repetition, not of units, 
but of groups. A measured motion seems to be at 
the root of all such devices of language, and their 
material type is the dance. StUl larger repetitions 
of sound, as in the stanzas of a long poem, or the 
threefold division of a Pindaric ode three times 
repeated, may have some sensuous effect on readers 
at large ; but their appreciation is mainly for experts. 

I believe that, scientifically treated, the vibrations 
of sound can be made to transform themselves into 
color and figure. But there is only a remote possi- 
bility that words can so affect the nerves of men. 
All coloresque, sculpturesque, or architectural effects 
produced by language must be the result of the 
association of ideas. We early learn the meanings 
of words, and as we go through life each one of them 
gathers riches to itself until it draws after it a train- 
load of pictures and impressions. There is no reason 
in nature why one word should mean one thing more 
than another — why the word " splendor," for ex- 
ample, should not mean darkness, or vice versa. 
But once fixed in our minds that splendor means a 
certain quality of light and color, it absorbs into 
itself all our experiences of magnificent natural or 
human glories — sunsets, serried mountain peaks, 
glowing autumn woods, great cities, man's strength, 
woman's grace, noble actions, and lofty dreams ; so 
that when the word is pronounced, all these concepts 
are shuttled before our eyes in one composite vision. 
When, therefore, the orator or poet or prose writer 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



297 



begins his art-work which is to intoxicate or com- 
mand us, he has disposed upon his palette thousands 
of words which are vivid with our blood, trembling 
with our life. Caesar refuses his revolting legionaries 
the title of Milites (soldiers), and calls them Quirites 
(citizens), and so quells the mutiny with a word. 
The Irish multitude is cold to the idea of the Trinity, 
until St. Patrick plucks the familiar shamrock from 
the sod and exemplifies the trinal unity. 

The wielder of language has not only single 
words freighted with associate ideas at his command, 
but he has analogies, metaphors, comparisons, sim- 
iles, parables, tales, to draw upon. The whole 
experience of the race is his — limited only by his 
hearer's or reader's intelligence. No other artist 
has a twentieth part of the weapons with which he 
is armed for the conquest of mankind. 

Charles Leonard Moore, 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A BRILLIANT PoLiSH GENIUS has passed prematurely 
from earth in the recent death of Stanislas Wyspianski, 
who at the age of thirty-eight had distinguished himself 
as poet, painter, dramatist, and sculptor. It is said that 
at twenty-five he produced a masterpiece with his brush, 
another with his pen at twenty-six, and that in his last 
decade he gave more literature to the world than his 
compatriot Sienckiewicz in a lifetime. The son of a 
sculptor, Wyspianski naturally took up the chisel as his 
first chosen tool ; but, oppressed with the thought of his 
country's unhappy fate, he seems to have needed more 
than one avenue by which to express himself and to 
attain a momentary forgetfulness of his melancholy. 
Noteworthy was his joining the movement of Cracow 
artists and writers to become the founders of a new 
race. Peasant women, healthy, ignorant, and unafflicted 
with nerves, were chosen to become the mothers of 
sturdy sons who should one day espouse their country's 
cause and liberate her from the foreign yoke. The 
coarseness and shrewishness of Wyspianski's mate seem 
to have grated on his nerves, but after she had borne 
him a number of children he married her, all the time 
toiling manfully for her and for their young family, — 
painting wonderful pictures and writing plays innumer- 
able. His drama " The Wedding " caused him to be 
reckoned by his admirers as the greatest writer Poland 
had produced in a century. Losing the control of the 
fingers of his right hand some months before his death, 
he made the doctor bind a pencil to his liand, and so 
wrote on (though he could no longer paint) to the end. 
A heroic soul, surely, and worthy of the country that 
gave him birth. ... , 

The rising standard of library schools is mat- 
ter for commendation. More and more is librarianship 
becoming recognized as a " learned " profession, and 
increasing honor will in future be paid to those who 
practise that profession. Entrance requirements and 
graduating tests in such library schools as that at 
Madison, or the one connected with the University of 
Illinois, or the parent school at Albany, and others 
besides, are by no means ignobly easy to pass. In 
the current catalogue of the Wisconsm Library School 
we read with satisfaction (under the heading, " Extra 



Entrance Requirements ") : " It is desired that as many 
as possible shall come to the school with actual library 
experience. Practical work in a good library for a year 
or more, in addition to the educational requirements, is 
the best preparation for the year's work in the school. 
Although desirable, such experience is often impossible, 
but accepted candidates who offer no library experience 
must spend at least one month in practical work in a 
designated library before the school opens in Septem- 
ber." And, what is even better, " It is desirable that 
every student should be reasonably familiar with the 
most notable literature in all of the principal depart- 
ments of learning, through actual reading of the books 
themselves. But an intimate acquaintance with certain 
books is a special entrance requirement. A copy of this 
required reading list accompanies the application blank, 
and is sent only to those making formal application for 
entrance to the school." 

Mrs. Humphry Ward at Smith College, lec- 
turing on " The Peasant in Literature," made a most 
favorable impression on her audience, and probably 
suggested to more than one hearer a comparison with 
her uncle Matthew, who also lectured there in his 
American visit of twenty years ago, more or less. It 
was a felicitous reference, on the part of President 
Seelye in his introductory address, to the warm feehng 
cherished in this country for all members of Thomas 
Arnold's family. Mrs. Ward's ease and grace of manner, 
and her command of an English not so baffling to 
American ears as her famous kinsman's curiously enun- 
ciated speech, were a delight and in some degree a 
stu-prise to those who remembered Matthew Arnold's 
platform appearance. A scholarly study of the humble 
coimtryman in literature, from Virgil's time to Miss 
Jane Barlow's, formed the substance of her address. 
That Mrs. Ward has herself, in her stories, presented 
us with types of English peasantry that deserve to sur- 
vive in literature, will have occurred to all who take 
pleasure in her Derbyshire rural characters — especially 
in her " Daffady," of « Helbeck of Bannisdale," and 
her 'Lias Dawson, as presented in " David Grieve." 
These characters surely prove that Mrs. Ward is not so 
far behind George Eliot in a sense of humor as some 
have too hastily declared. A noteworthy circumstance 
in connection with Mrs. Ward's visit to Massachusetts 
is the arrangement she is said to have made with Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. for the issue of a complete and 
imiform edition of her works, which will be illustrated, 
and will be heralded by a detailed prospectus in due 
course of time. This will be the first uniform edition of 
her writings. 

A publisher of the good old school has been 
taken from us in the death of John Murray Brown, 
senior member of the well-known Boston firm of Little, 
Brown, & Co. Not only those writers who have had 
personal experience of his genial approachableness and 
his ready response to all appeals in behalf of good liter- 
ature, but also the wider circle of readers and lovers of 
the best in the way of books, will regret his too-early 
departure from the scene of his useful labors. Named 
after John Murray — ■ the John Murray of sixty years 
ago — and inspired with similar ideals, Mr. Brown was, 
line Murray, the son of a prominent publisher and the 
father of a publisher; in fact, two of his four sons, 
Murray and Philip, are associated with the paternal 
publishing house and in a position to hand on its tradi- 
tions to succeeding Murray Browns. Not only did the

late Mr. Brown succeed to his father in business, but he 
inherited from him the fine estate in Belmont that he 
made his home. Interesting himself in the welfare of 
his native town, he served for many years on the board 
of trustees of the Belmont Public Library, and was be- 
loved and esteemed by all with whom this and other 
offices and duties brought him in contact. Among his 
classmates at Harvard were the late John Fiske and 
Jeremiah Curtin. Curtin's translations from the Polish, 
it will be remembered, and also his original works, were 
published by his classmate's house. Like James T. 
Fields of an earlier generation, and other famous Boston 
publishers, Mr. Brown contributed much toward that 
city's prestige in the world of books and of literary 
culture. • • « 

The ideal and the real in librarianship, as in 
every field of high endeavor, are so lamentably (or shall 
we say so ludicrously) discrepant that the spectacle of 
a graduating library-school class setting forth on its 
exalted mission in this world of illiteracy and material- 
ism may well move to thoughts that do lie too deep for 
tears, and that are therefore forced to avail themselves 
of a smile or a jest as the only avenue of outlet. A 
recent paragraph of ours (headed " A Library Sign of 
the Season ") touching, with an attempt at playful humor, 
on this aspect of the young librarian's noble calling, has 
given unintended pain to at least one of our readers, who 
for some reason regards the paragraph as aimed at the 
Library School of the University of Illinois, and takes 
occasion, in a friendly way, to deplore the acridity which, 
our correspondent thinks, seasons this and other items of 
our library comment. Perhaps it may be well to say here 
that the passage in question was suggested by a news 
item referring to a library school not in Illinois, and that 
our comment was of the most general and impersonal 
nature, applicable to hbrary schools in the moon — if 
there are any there. But attempts at facetiousne.ss are 
always perilous, and we are glad to be rebuked, if the 
rebuke is deserved. It is at least gratifying to be charged 
with acridity rather than with insipidity.

More reading and less talking might be sug- 
gested as a cure for many of the ills to which this 
eagerly disputatious twentieth century is heir. The 
Rev. B. S^Lombard of London has attracted attention by 
declaring that many of the nervous diseases and much of 
the insanity that now afflict society are due to excessive 
indulgence in conversation. Wonderful, when one seri- 
ously considers the matter, is the amoimt of energy that 
can be dissipated in empty words ; and equally surprising 
is the gratifying discovery that unmeasm-ed volumes of 
energy may be stored up by the silent, thoughtful, atten- 
tive perusal of a powerful book. He who has not felt 
the renewal of force, the restoration of personal effec- 
tiveness, that often come with the reading of a play or 
only a page of Shakespeare, or a book of Homer, or a 
chapter of Scott, has a pleasant sensation and a valuable 
experience still in store. To be sure, the spoken word 
and living presence of a gifted man or woman may 
equally, or in a greater degree, inspire one; but how 
few of those with whom we daily consort speak with the 
tongues of angels, and how well convinced we are, or 
ought to be, that some half-dozen at least of the immor- 
tals have it always in their power to kindle us and make 
us glow — unless there be something seriously at fault in 
ourselves. That ancient philosopher who put out his eyes 
in order to concentrate his gaze on the things within, 
would in this age have destroyed his hearing also, in 



order to hearken the more diligently to the still small 
voice in his own breast. There are those who, from com- 
pulsion and not from choice, have learned to value the 
quiet that comes with the dying away of outward noises, 
and to prize the precious time set free for the deeper 
things of literature and life when ordinary conversation 
has become inaudible to deafened ears.

A BEE-HIVE IN A LIBRARY is not an everyday sight, 
but this spectacle was seen, during the last Fall and 
Winter, in the children's room of the Medford (Mass). 
Public Library, whose resourceful librarian. Miss Mary 
E. Sargent, firmly believes in showing the child of to- 
day, who is to be our citizen or perhaps our ruler of 
to-morrow, every possible attention of a helpful and 
educative sort. Hence this observation hive of bees, 
loaned by a Wobm-n bee-keeper, and watched by the 
little folk of Medford with intelhgent interest. Another 
novel mark of attention shown to the child, but perhaps 
not so keenly appreciated, is the insertion into books 
given out from the juvenile department, of slips of paper 
bearing the following suggestive lines — the idea being 
borrowed from Miss Hewins of the Hartford Public 
Library: 

" THE LIBRARY GOOPS. 
/" With apologies to Gelett Burgess.) 

" The goops they wet their fingers 
To turn the leaves of books, 
And then they crease the corners down 
And think that no one looks. 

" They print the marks of dirty hands, 
' Of lollipops and gum. 
On picture book and fairy book 
As often as they come." 

These verses are also conspicuously posted for the ben- 
efit of all untidy children — and one may hope to hear 
later of good results accruing.

An UNDESERVED ASPERSION, for which we are glad 
to make such amends as may be possible, was our recent 
inadvertent characterization of New Orleans as one of 
the only two large American cities " that have thus far 
found life tolerable without a public library." The 
following statement, supplied on excellent authority, 
indicates a situation quite different : " The Fiske Free 
Public Library of New Orleans was founded in 1845; 
though supported entirely by endowment, it afforded 
free library privileges. Its requirements, by reason of 
growth, were not covered by its income, and it was 
taken over by the city and additional support given in 
1895. The Howard Memorial Library has been a free 
reference library for twenty years; it has one of the 
best collections in the country, and is especially strong 
in American history. New Orleans was the recipient, 
in 1903, of a gift of $250,000 from Andrew Carnegie, 
for a new central library building with a number of 
branches. The new central building is nearing com- 
{)letion. Two of the branches have already been opened, 
and the others are already planned and under way. 
Henry M. Gill is librarian of the New Orleans Public 
Library. The name of this library was changed at the 
time of the Carnegie gift."

A UTILITARIAN DEFENSE OF LITERARY CULTURE haS

that it is just because the study of the classics has been 
abandoned by business men in France that the French 
are losing ground, relatively to other nations, in the 
commercial struggle for existence. The mental train- 
ing furnished by a classical education, he believes, is of 
value in the business world, and can be gained by no 
other course of study or system of drill. This valiant 
protest will fall on deaf ears, for the most part, but it 
is richly worth while to have made it. There is no 
honorable calling for which a good education in the 
"humanities" is too good. One can even measure 
calico better and sell it more successfully if, in the 
pages of great writers, one has caught a glimpse of the 
eternities and the immensities that no yardstick can 
begin to measure. To aim at doing well one small 
thing and no more, is to court failure even in that one 
thing; while to be vastly greater than one's work, and 
to do that work with the left hand, as it were, leaving 
unsuspected reserves of power for the emergencies 
that are sure to arise, is to command success. This 
utilitarian apologia for the higher truths and the deeper 
realities is hardly needed, but perhaps it is never entirely 
superfluous. , , . 

The removal of the reproach of senility will be 
accomplished if Dr. Borland and Professor Metchntkoff 
have their way. The Philadelphia physician is bringing 
a powerful array of evidence to bear on the "Century" 
readers to convince them of the productivity and effec- 
tiveness of ripe old age, and the French bacteriologist 
is bending his energies toward the understanding and 
control of the fauna and flora of the intestinal regions and 
the prevention of the life-shortening ravages wrought by 
those microscopic forms of life in the basement sections 
of our alimentary canal. Let us think for a moment of 
the future gain to literature in this possible doubling of 
himian longevity. Though the coming litterateur of one 
hundred and fifty years might not break forth into songs 
of spring and lyrics of love, what a store of observation 
and ripened thought he would possess for the writing 
of historical and philosophical works ! Systems of ethics 
and books of counsel to the young and collections of 
homilies would fall from his pen as naturally as mellow 
pears from the tree in September. Senility (or perhaps 
we shall prefer the term " senectitude ") will acquire 
an unimagined glory, and instead of saying with 
Wordsworth that " to be young was very heaven " we 
shall feel that to grow old, in health and strength, is 
the crowning satisfaction of life.

Sensitiveness about one's name, and a rigid in- 
sistence upon the proper observance by others of its 
established form and orthography, are common and 
on the whole creditable human characteristics. Occa- 
sionally, however, these are permitted to assume the 
proportions of a mania, not seldom betraying its victim 
into a situation either mirthful or distressing to the 
sane looker-on, A case in point, rich in irony, came 
recently to our notice. Not long ago a certain store 
received a postal card order bearing an unusually 
illegible signature. After long and prayerful cogitation, 
one particular guess at the occult scrawl was accepted 
as more probably correct than any other of numer- 
ous possibilities, and the order was despatched in due 
form. That the guess was a fairly good one, later 
developments proved, no less than eleven of the thirteen 
letters composing the signature being correct. But 
the true cognomaniac will recognize no degree or ex- 
tenuating circumstances in orthographic crime. Next 



day came a letter from him of the cryptic signature 
informing the astonished proprietor that all business 
relations between them had reached finality. Explana- 
tions or apologies, he took pains to specify, would be 
unavailing; the decree was irrevocable. Sadly the pro- 
prietor perused this amazing letter, — then an ironic 
chuckle escaped him. The first word of the missive 
was his own surname, and it was mis-spelled!

The man behind the manuscript is entertainingly 
discussed by " a publisher's first reader " in the April 
issue of " The Editor." The typewriter has done much 
to destroy individuality in authors' manuscripts, but this 
" first reader " has the eye of a detective for those 
minute, inconspicuous marks of personality that still 
remain. Among the most curious are those described 
in the following extract from this interesting article: 
" A sad moment comes to the First Reader's heart when 
he chances on the Suspicious Man Behind the Manu- 
script. As he turns the pages of this Man's story he 
comes on tell-tale bits of white paper or even on hairs 
placed at certain intervals throughout. This Man has 
laid a trap for the publisher. If his manuscript isn't 
read all the way through he is going to know it, and 
not only that, he means to know why also. Gently the 
First Reader, to avoid trouble, shakes out the pages 
until he is fairly sure that all these Sherlock Holmes 
devices have fallen out; it is an innocent deception, 
has taken very little time, and may avoid feeling. But 
he sighs at the attitude of mind that demands of 
the cheese-taster that he shall eat the whole cheese in 
every instance to determine whether it is fresh or 
rancid." ^ ... 

The public library book hospital is an important 
adjunct of the public library. Book-repairing and book- 
binding can be profitably done on the premises, especially 
if the librarian, or one or two of his assistanti, is deft- 
fingered and possessed of some mechanical ingenuity. 
After an experience of three years in conducting a bind- 
ery and repair shop in connection with the institution 
under his charge, the librarian of the Easton (Pa.) Pubhc 
Library is convmced that it is profitable for even small 
libraries to do their own rebinding and repairing. He 
believes that the work is well within the capacity of the 
average library assistant to master in a comparatively 
short time, and that his odd moments, if employed in 
this not unpleasant task, will keep the books in present- 
able condition. His report of the average cost of this 
rebinding and repairing is an astonishing one. In the 
past year 1620 volumes were handled in his book hospital,

A periodical with a creditable history, the

" Chambers's Journal," has celebrated its three-quarter- 
centennial. " Auld Reekie " has much to be proud of; 
and among the products of its genius and industry not 
the least important are the works of literature and 
learning bearing the Chambers imprint. What a rich 
repertory of curious and instructive reading is contained 
in the faded yellow volumes of " Chambers's Miscellany,"

The Real, Hearn.* 



It is most natural that noble achievement in 
literature should beget interest in the person- 
ality and life history of the author. The more 
we know about the man the better shall we 
interpret his utterances, and the more justly 
shall we estimate the value of his ideas. And 
yet is it not possible to know too much ? May 
we not thereby be tempted to look beyond the 
words, and fail nevertheless to take note of the 
extraordinary contradictions and inconsistencies 
that enter into the complexity of the human 
mind ? The work, when all is said and done, 
is the thing that is most worth dwelling upon. 
Can it add anything to the pleasure or profit 
with which we contemplate the lovely flowers of 
the lotus to be told that they spring from a bed 
of slime? And when that fact is proclaimed 
may we not entertain a much exaggerated notion 
of its repulsiveness ? 

These questions are called forth by the pe- 
rusal of Dr. George M. Gould's psychological 
study " Concerning Lafcadio Hearn." The 
book is a portrait rather than a biography. 
" For those who boasted of being his friends," 
Dr. Gould writes, "it seems an astonishing 
thing that they should make Hearn portray his 
vices, hie moral nakedness, so publicly." It 
might be supposed that one holding this view 
would gloss over these failings. Instead, per- 
haps no one else has more sharply delineated 
them. Having been heralded to the world, it 
is well that they should be shown in their true 
light. To correct misconceptions about them 
and to explain some of the traits that made 
Hearn mil ike other men are among the purposes 
for which this book is written. 

For the best of Hearn's literary work Dr. 
Gould has high praise. The precious quality 
of his poetic prose meets with enthusiastic com- 
mendation. For the man himself he has com- 
passionate regard, but sees no reason why illu- 
sion as to his " greatness " should be entertained. 
He well says: 

" Deprived by nature, by the necessities of his life, 
or by conscious intention, of religion, morality, scholar- 
ship, magnanimity, loyalty, character, benevolence, and 
other constituents of personal greatness, it is more than 
folly to endeavor to place him thus wrongly before the 
world." 

With this conclusion there can be no cavil ; 

•Concerning Lafcadio Hearn. By George M.Gould, M.D. 
With a Bibliography by Laura Stedman. Philadelphia: George 
W. Jacobs & Co. 



though in passing it may be questioned whether 
personal greatness is necessarily synonymous 
with moral greatness. And has not the attri- 
buting of greatness, to which Dr. Gould takes 
exception, been made, not to Hearn himself, but 
to his writings, — and in particular to his books 
about Japan, which Dr. Gould aptly calls " a 
benefaction and a delight to the entire world " ? 

The many admirers of Hearn's books need no 
longer rest under any misapprehension as to the 
mental make-up of the author. Of character, 
defined as " the action or reaction of personality 
against circumstance, not under and dominated 
by circumstance," we are told that he had none 
whatever. This is how Dr. Gould sums up his 
characteristics : 

" His was the most unresisting, most echolike mind I 
have ever known. He was a perfect chameleon ; he took 
for the time the color of his surroundings. He was 
always the mirror of the friend of the instant, or, if no 
friend was there, of the dream of that instant. The next 
minute he was another being; acted upon by the new cir- 
cumstance, reflecting the new friend, or redreaming the 
old and new-found dream. They who blame him too 
sharply for his disloyalty and ingratitude to old friends 
do not imderstand him psychologically. There was 
nothing behind the physical and neurologic machine to 
be loyal or disloyal. . . . He had no mind, or character, 
to be possessed of loyalty or disloyalty. . . . One does 
not ask originality or even great consistency of an echo, 
and of all men that have ever lived, Hearn, mentally and 
spiritually, was most perfectly an echo. The sole quality, 
the only originality he brought to the fact, or to the echo, 
was color — a peculiar derivation of a maimed sense. He 
created or invented nothing; his stories were always told 
him by others. . . . His merit, almost his sole merit, and 
his unique skill, lay in the strange facultj"^ of coloring 
the echo. ... So that, fused as he was with his work, 
he himself became that impossible thing, a chromatic 
voice, a multicolored echo." 

Again and again are these things recurred to 
in the course of the book. Many of them are 
explained by Hearn's defective vision ; others by 
the constitution of his mind, " improcreant by 
inheritance and by education, by necessity and 
by training, by poverty internal and external." 
And yet, we are told, " two attributes are beyond 
all analysis": 

" One was a thing illogical with his character, his 
cleaving to an ideal of literary workmanship at the cost 
of selfishness, friendships, and temporary success; and 
the other was his marvellous literary and psychologic 
sympathy with whatever mind, people, circumstance, 
story, or tradition, accident or choice brought before the 
echoing or mirroring mind." 

But do these attributes defy analysis ? Do they 
not negative the assertion that Hearn's mind 
was " without creative ability, spring, or the 
desire for it "? It may be rash to differ from 
one who not only knew Hearn intimately, but 
whose opportunities for insight have been excep 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



301 



tional. Yet it seems clear enough that with all 
his limitations and disabilities Hearn had never- 
theless within him a compulsion essentially crea- 
tive in its nature. The scope and direction of 
the creative impulse were determined by his 
myopia. The only thing possible for him to 
do was to write ; but writing may be an art, 
and whatever Hearn was or was not, there can 
be no doubt that he was an artist. He may not 
have originated his stories, but he did create the 
beautiful vesture of words in which he presented 
them to the world. The mistake Dr. Gould 
makes would seem to be the familiar one of 
regarding the content of works of art as insep- 
arable from the form, and of failing to perceive 
that the creative work of the artist may be, and 
indeed most frequently is, wholly spent upon the 
latter. 

On the whole, the picture of Hearn drawn by 
Dr. Gould does not differ materially from that 
to which we were accustomed. It is a little 
sharper in outline, a little more explicit in 
detail, that is all. Some mistakes have been 
corrected, and doubt is expressed as to the au- 
thenticity of the story of Hearn 's early years as 
given in his " Life and Letters." There is a 
welcome list of unsigned editorials contributed by 
Hearn to the New Orleans " Times-Democrat," 
one or two of which are reprinted, together with 
a number of excerpts from letters and other 
writings. 

Somewhat more than half of the volume is 
taken up by Dr. Goidd's interesting series of 
" epitomes " of all of Hearn's books ; and a full 
bibliography compiled by Miss Laura Stedman, 
which includes unpublished works in manu- 
script, papers contributed to periodicals, books 
and critical articles about Hearn, and a long 
list of his translations printed in the New Orleans 
" Times-Democrat." These are valuable features 
which can hardly fail of wide appreciation.

The Hobo in Theory and Practice.* 

Two recently published books about the 
Tramp (or the Hobo, or the Vagrant, as one 
may choose to caU him) are interesting because 
they deal with the matter in rather a comple- 
mentary way, one handling the topic theoreti- 
cally and the other practically. Mr. Edmond 
Kelly has thought the matter out, and provides 

• The Elimination op the Tramp. By Edmond Kelly.

The Road. By Jack London. New York: The Macmillan Co. 



a scientific monograph ; Mr. Jack London has 
personally gone through the experience and pro- 
vides a romantic reminiscence. We recommend 
both books to the inquirer. 

Mr. Kelly gives a study of the subject based 
on the system by which Switzerland has suc- 
ceeded in putting a practical end to vagrancy, 
and offers an adaptation of it to our conditions. 
He urges the necessity of some plan by means 
of which a magistrate — police judge or other — 
may be able to deal with all homeless men brought 
before him in a manner more just and useful 
than the simple sending everyone who cannot 
pay a fine to the jail or penitentiary. There are 
aU sorts of people who may become vagrants for 
the time being, but especially three kinds. There 
are men who can work and wish to work if they 
can find employment, men who cannot or will 
not do regular work on account of age or other 
cause, and men who do not want to work and 
will not if they can help it. The last only are 
the true wanderers, vagrants, tramps, hoboes. 
Of the first class there have been many this past 
winter. Mr. Kelly thinks that the best thing 
to do for them is to devise some means by which 
such men can show that they really are working- 
men, and then to maintain them till they can be 
helped to some regular employment. The other 
classes make up the people for whom some sort 
of institutional plan seems necessary. 

Several European countries (small ones) han- 
dle this problem by means of farm-colonies. 
Mr. Kelly gives an account of the Swiss system, 
which he believes to be the best. It con- 
sists essentially of one kind of colony to which 
are sent those who can and will do some sort of 
work, and another kind to which are sent those 
who do not wish to work but must be made 
to. If a man is really a working-man and can 
prove it (in Switzerland by a " traveller's relief- 
book "), the judge has no business with him. If 
a man is really a vagrant, but is willing and able 
to do some work, the judge can send him to a 
place where there is work that he can do. If a 
man be a true hobo, the judge can send him to 
a " forced labor colony," where he will be made 
to work. 

If a man be sent to a forced labor colony for 
a term, he is afterward given the option of going 
to a free labor colony. If he wants to go, he 
has really made a start in becoming a decent 
workingman or laborer. If he refuses to go 
and returns to the road he will pretty soon come 
before a magistrate again, and the same thing 
will occur over again, except that he may then 
take the chance of going to the free labor colony

and be reformed. If he continue refractory, 
however, he can be dealt with, not as a tramp 
but as a criminal. 

Such being the plan offered by Mr. Kelly, 
Mr. Jack London's book gives an idea of the 
kind of people that such a plan must provide 
for in this country. On the face of it, Mr. 
London would seem to have been a hobo not for 
any literary or academic reason but because he 
liked to be, — in fact for the same reason that any- 
one else might be. And this fact gives his book 
certain advantages and disadvantages as a docu- 
ment for anyone who wishes to study closely the 
phenomena of tramp life. It has, on the one hand, 
very considerable knowledge of the subject, but 
on the other it has the obvious unreliability of 
such a source. As to the matter of knowledge, 
of course such people think they know every- 
thing about their own way of life. A hobo 
always presents himself as " wise," and Mr. Jack 
London, like the rest, knows an extraordinary 
amount, although he does sometimes confess 
ignorance. As to the reliability of his informa- 
tion, he tells us himself of half a dozen times 
when he lied for his own advantage, and it will 
be a credulous reader who does not at least sus- 
pect the possibility of becoming one case more. 

Still, looking at the book with severely criti- 
cal eyes, one gets a picture of a person very 
difficidt to reform. Mr. Kelly's plan works in 
Switzerland, and his adaptation to American 
conditions seems sound ; but the tramp, as Jack 
London pictures himself and others, appears to 
us to need more vigorous treatment than a farm 
colony. One has to search diligently through 
the book to find any quality or trait (not purely 
physical) that is not vicious. Mr. Jack London 
in his tramp days was, of course, a professional 
beggar and thief, and lived by what he could get 
out of the good-hearted and foolish. But he 
was otherwise a poor type. He tells us (among 
other such matters) how he made friends with a 
man for what he could get out of him and de- 
serted him at the first possible minute. He tells 
us how he joined a set of people and sold them 
out the first chance he got, and then sold out 
those who helped him sell out the others. He 
does not seem to have been a person who would 
be much improved by a farm-colony, even with 
forced labor. 

It does not seem probable that Mr. Jack 
London would be much impressed with the plan 
that Mr. Kelly proposes. Nor does Mr. Kelly 
seem to consider just the type that Mr. London 
presents in his reminiscences. As to the value 
of what a third party may think (no specialist 



on either side), there will be much doubt. With 
some diffidence, therefore, we propound some 
objections, with the idea of bringing the matter 
as fully to view as possible. 

And first as to the honest workman. The 
idea of identification is a very desirable one, but 
very difficult to carry out. For anyone who 
gives an identification-book or card can also 
withhold it. And as the proof that a man is 
a working-man must in general come from the 
person he has worked for, it will be seen that 
the plan gives a good deal of power to the 
employer. Mr. Kelly recognizes this difficulty, 
but attaches less weight to it than we are inclined 
to. Passing that point, however, it shoidd be 
noted that the establishment of real municipal 
lodging-houses is not yet common, — in fact, it is 
in the dim future. In most cities to-day there 
is no regular way of looking after an honest man 
out of work. This winter thousands have had 
to beg, and many have gone a step farther. 

In regard to farm-colonies in general, it is 
pretty clear that the plan is not in accord with 
the genius of the American hobo, who is not of 
the agricultural period of development, but is a 
sort of Ishmaelitish city-dweller. In other words, 
it is probable that the keeping him on a farm- 
colony would be a serious matter. And if the 
farm-colonies became practically penitentiaries 
the matter would not be much ahead of present 
conditions. Of course what the tramp needs is 
moral regeneration, and this reminds one natu- 
rally of General Booth's " Darkest England " 
colony-plan. But this plan we need not discuss 
here. In theory it was not so very different 
from Mr. KeUy's plan; yet it was proposed 
twenty years ago, has had a great deal of money 
spent upon it, and is not to-day so striking a 
success that Mr. Kelly even mentions it. 

We think, jn fine, that Mr. Kelly's plan would 
be an improvement on present conditions, but 
we cannot think that it would eliminate the 
tramp. The tramp to-day is the result of con- 
ditions of our civilization that must change before 
their present results pass away.

FYNES MORYSON : ELIZABETHAN 

Traveller.* 



The handsome volumes of Mory son's valuable 
" Itinerary," now coming from the press of 
Messrs. James MacLehose & Sons, Glasgow, 
are doubly welcome ; for they not only make 
easily accessible a book of travel well worth know- 
ing, but also show that the bold venture of 
Mr. Charles Hughes in issuing (in 1903) his 
" Shakespeare's Europe : Unpublished Chapters 
of Fynes Moryson's Itinerary " has awakened 
enough of interest in the traveller to cause the 
reprinting of the older work. 

The original " Itinerary " appeared in 1617, 
in a stately folio of nearly 900 pages, under the 
segis of John Beale, dwelling at London in 
Aldersgate street. The new edition is to be 
completed in four volumes, with a brief " pub- 
lishers' note " about the life of Mory son, and 
with a full index, a feature sadly missed by all 
who knew the old edition. Otherwise we are 
promised a faithful reprint of the original work 
" except that the letters i, j, u, and v have been 
altered to conform to modern usage, and obvious 
printers' errors, both of spelling and punctuation, 
have been corrected" Mr. Hughes gave us 
what he regarded as the most valuable portions 
of the manuscript which Mory son left unprinted. 
The pious wish of the worthy traveller was thus 
in part fulfilled some three hundred years after 
he had, as we may well believe, abandoned the 
vain search for a publisher. " Shakespeare's 
Europe " follows the manuscript faithfully, 
except for obvious slips of the pen, even to the 
letters i, j, u, and v, thus reproducing the sincere 
and catholic spelling of the old " Itinerary." 
The editor has made us his debtors by giving 
us a valuable Introduction, but failed, alas ! to 
add the full index. Passages quoted below 
from the " Itinerary " follow the original edi- 
tion, as the reprint has, at this writing, not 
progressed far enough to supply all of them ; 
but the paging of the old has fortimately been 
indicated in the new edition. 

Shortly after the publication of " Shake- 
speare's Europe," it was my good fortune to take 
up both of Moryson's works at the close of a 
fresh perusal of the genuine unabridged Pepys's 
"Diary " of Wheatley's ample pages. Surely it 
was not the mere chance of proximity that made 
the men appear as much alike as a staid older

and a frolicsome younger brother. To be sure, 
the Clerk of the Acts of the days of Charles II. 
may not seem at first glance to have much in 
common with the smug and pedantic tourist of 
the days of good Queen Bess. The diarist 
bares his soul as no man before or after him ; 
and therefore the trim, precise, and rigid figure 
of the traveller, as he reveals himself in his own 
pages, may fail at first to suggest kinship with 
dear, honest, "grafting," patriotic, truthful, 
lying, loving, licentious Sam Pepys. The ex- 
ternal resemblance is, of course, closer to the 
Samuel Pepys of Braybooke's supplement, where 
solemn papers, letters, and memoranda almost 
make us lose the diarist in the Clerk of the 
Acts. Moryson is, nevertheless, an older Pepys, 
who reveals the similarity, if in nothing else, in 
his wide-ranging curiosity, and in his sane and 
lucid, though unornamented, English. 

The personal equation, as necessary to know 
in the case of the traveller as of the diarist, is 
for the most part easily ascertainable for Mory- 
son. Even the industry of his editor has dis- 
covered little more about him than he has himself 
told. When the Fellow of Peterhouse College, 
Cambridge, set sail for Stade, in 1591, to begin 
his first journey on the continent, he was already 
old enough (he was bom in 1566) to have most 
of his convictions firmly settled. As the third 
son of a numerous family, his financial prospects 
by way of inheritance were small. Of suffi- 
ciently bold and active spirit, we may believe 
that, despite the labored reasons which he gives 
for his undertaking, the real motive was the 
desire of change and adventure ; for travelling 
in Europe was then no mere holiday excursion. 
In its risk of death or captivity, and in its 
dangers by land and sea, it was more comparable 
(though the mere comparison is, of course, an 
exaggeration) with a journey into the heart of 
Africa to-day. The gambling spirit of the time 
regarded the odds against safe return as at least 
three to one, as may be evidenced by Moryson's 
brother Henry, who, when about to accompany 
him on his second voyage, put out £400, after 
a common form of speculation in those days, to 
receive .£1200 on his return, or to lose all, — 
and lost. Fynes staked a smaller sum in a 
similar way ; but though he walked London's 
streets again, the treachery of supposed friends 
cut him short of his expected gains. 

A firm will and an enterprising spirit were 
not Moryson's sole equipment for his journey. 
The Fellow of Peterhouse was manifestly abreast 
of the learning of his times, priding himself as 
being more skilful in Latin than even the Teu-

tons, and speaking, before his return, French, 
German, and Italian fluently. A staunch Pro- 
testant hatred of Turks, Jews, Romish priests, 
Jesuits, and " mere " Irish, is never hidden ; 
while the " English " Irish come in for dislike 
only less violent. Everywhere through his writ- 
ings is revealed that spirit of condescension which 
even to-day so endears some travellers to the 
rest of the world. And yet at times he coidd 
see clearly and judge rightly of matters wherein 
the English came off only second-best. As in 
the case of Pepys, appreciation of literary values 
was one of his weak points ; and if he had as 
frankly recorded his opinions now and then, they 
would doubtless have been as silly. Not least 
of his whole equipment was blindness to the 
beauties of art and nature. One delightful sen- 
tence (" Itinerary," III., p. 54), " Sweitzerland 
consists of hills and Mountaines, so as they do 
likewise trauell on horseback," reveals the man 
like a lightning flash. That he had his senti- 
mental side we know from many little digres- 
sions, — as when he lingers, for example, over 
the Morosini family, famous in Venetian annals, 
" for the Consonancy of that name " with his 
own ; but the careless reader may be pardoned 
for seeing in him a typical stage Englishman 
solemnly recording his " expences for horses and 
mans meat " for the benefit of myriads of other 
Englishmen who should follow after him. 

Yet the very absence of most of what we look 
for in a modern book of travel is what makes 
Moryson's work most valuable to the modem 
reader. Opinions about art, descriptions of 
scenery, attempts to give local color, we have 
galore, and will read none that smack of ancient 
days ; but the price of a sixteenth-century hen 
in Poland, the stockingless condition of the 
ladies of Germany, the laws of inheritance in 
Venice, — these are topics that charm peren- 
nially. 

The events of Moryson's life which interest 
us are few. Two journeys (separated only by 
some six months in England in 1595) filled up 
the six years from May 1, 1591, to July 10, 
1597. On the first he saw much of the 
Netherlands, Germany, and Italy (as far south 
as Naples), with glimpses of Poland, Bohemia, 
Austria, Switzerland, and France ; on the second 
and briefer, he went to Jerusalem and European 
Turkey by way of Germany and Venice. We 
learn also of a trip to the North of England, 
and a flying excursion into Scotland. In 1600 
he accompanied Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, 
as a sort of secretary to the Irish wars. From 
the death of that nobleman, in 1606, we lose 



about all trace of him, except for the publication 
of his " Itinerary " in 1617. The industry of 
Mr. Hughes has unearthed his will, and settled 
the date of his death as February 12, 1629-30. 

Moryson's worldly gear is a not uninteresting 
topic. When he set out on his first journey, his 
pocket was doubtless none too abundantly filled 
by the gifts of his father and by the annual 
stipend of £20 from Peterhouse which he con- 
tinued to draw for a number of years as a travel- 
ling Fellow. But travelling was cheap in those 
days. A quotation on this point will also serve 
to illustrate the clearness of Moryson's style, as 
weU as his tinge of pedantry and insular conceit 
(" Itinerary," III., p. 13) : 

" Fifty or sixty pounds sterling yeerely, were suffi- 
cient at the time when I was beyond sea, to beare the 
charge of a Trauellers diet, necessary apparrell, and two 
ioumies yeerely, in the Spring and Autumne, and also 
to serue him for moderate expences of pleasure, so that 
hee imitated not the Germans, who drinke and banquet 
as much abroad, as at home, nor the Italians, who liue 
they among Christians or Pagans, yet cannot restraine 
their incontinency ; nor the Polonians, who being perhaps 
the sonnes of Castellani, (I meane such as liaue the keep- 
ing of Castles, or like entertainments from the King onely 
for their life), commonly spend more prodigally in Italy, 
and lite places, then at home, so as many times they 
spend their whole patrimony abroad. In which kind I 
cannot but commend our Countrunen, who howsoeuer at 
home they may haue spent prodigally, yet going beyond 
seas, rather dispose their expences to repaire this former 
prodigalitie then otherwise and practise the rule of the 

Poet, . ^ 

Intra f ortunam quamque manere suam : 

Each man his cote to fit, 

As his cloth will permit." 

His father died while he was on his first 
journey, leaving him bequests which amounted 
to about X500, according to Mr. Hughes. 
After the Irish war we hear of a pension of six 
shillings a day. Though his wiU reveals neither 
money nor lands, he seems to have lived in his 
latter years the peaceful and easy life of the 
unmarried scholar, doubtless pottering over his 
books and manuscripts to the very end. An 
amusing passage in his account of his visit to 
Loreto throws unexpected light on his reason- 
able content with his fortunes. Loreto brought 
all his Protestant zeal to a white glow, and it is 
a pity that we must be content with the quota- 
tion of a few lines of his narrative (" Itinerary," 
I., p. 100): 

" When we came forth (as the Italians prouerbially 
speake of the Priests auarice, Euery Psalme ends in 
Glory he, ^c. as if they should say. All religion to end 
in profit) it was necessarie for vs to cast almes into an 
iron chest behind the Altar, couered with an iron grate. 
Therefore, my consorts, of purpose to delight the 
Priests eares with the sound of money, as with musicke, 
did cast into that chest many brasse quatrines, but of 
small value, and my self e being last, when my turne was

to gfiue almes, did in stead thereof, gather some teane 
quatirnes [sic] of theirs, which lay scattered upon the 
grate, and got that cleare gaine by that IdoU. God 
forbid I should bragge of any contempt to Religion; 
but since it appears, that such worship is vnpleasing to 
God: and because Papists will haue all their miracles 
beleeued, I will freely say by experience, that hauing 
gotten these few quatirnes in such sort as I said, yet 
after that, God of his mercy preserued me in my long 
and dangerous trauell, and from that time to this day, 
by his grace, I haue enioyed, though no abundant, yet 
a competent estate, and more plentifuU then in my 
former dayes." 

Mory son's published " Itinerary " is divided 
into three parts of about equal length. The first 
is the Itinerary proper, — a narrative of his daily 
route, the cost of food and horse hire, the enu- 
meration of the things seen at each place, at 
first sight as unpromising as Pepys's record, but 
not unlike it in the interest which suddenly 
appears in the midst of the dullest narrative. 
The second part is an account of the Irish war, 
in which Mory son had a modest share. The 
third deals voluminously with such topics as the 
geography, traffic, diet, apparel, military forces, 
laws, and rulers of the states through which he 
passed. The manuscript which Mr. Hughes has 
given us in print is, so far as published, essen- 
tially a continuation of the third part, dwelling 
at greater length on social institutions and usages. 

Different portions of the two books have differ- 
ent values. Mory son was both an observer and 
a compiler. Where he observes most, — as in 
Germany, Venice, Florence, and Turkey, — he 
is most valuable and interesting. Where he com- 
piles most, — as in his long description of Rome, 
where, for fear of the priests, he dared stay only 
four days, — he is most a bore. In several re- 
spects, too, he travelled at an auspicious time, 
knowing intimately the Germany of the good 
old days before the Thirty Years' War, visiting 
Turkey when it was still a menace to Europe, 
and justly conscious, so soon after the defeat of 
the Spanish Armada, of the proud position of his 
own country. An Englishman of Pepys's days 
would have seen a vastly different Europe and 
a humbled England. 

To the sober-minded reader, portions of Mr. 
Hughes's publication, particularly those concern- 
ing Germany and Turkey, offer much valuable 
information not obtainable elsewhere. But far 
be it from us to commend Moryson merely on 
such utilitarian grounds. The lowest and basest 
of the reasons for accepting gratefully such a 
book is surely its usefulness. If there be those 
who, taking up the journal of the Clerk of the 
Acts, would rather read sometimes of the rising 
price of tickets to the pit, or of how Mrs. Pepys 



made ready to apply the red-hot tongs to the 
nose of her erring though repentant husband, 
than of the voyage of Charles II. back to the 
England which he disgraced, they may find 
material to their liking in Moryson's pages, 
though doubtless less delightsome. 

It will depend whoUy on the taste of the 
reader whether he regards the " Itinerary " or 
its continuation as the more enjoyable. More 
useful the latter certainly is for everyone in 
search of solid information. In this necessary 
division of opinion, and in view of the fact that 
" Shakespeare's Europe " has been accessible 
for several years, while the " Itinerary " has yet 
to gain its friends in its new form, we may find 
our excuse for confining ourselves hereafter ex- 
clusively to the latter. 

Unfortunately, there is not space to quote 
Moryson's ambitious scheme of what the traveller 
should observe. He bids him note (III., p. 10) 
the fertility of the soil and its products, the 
mines of metals and precious stones, the abund- 
ance and kinds of food with the cost thereof, 
" the rare and proper Beasts,' costumes, habits, 
laws, " the magnificence of Citizens, their house- 
hold stuffe, and in generall all speciall'things, 
as Statuaes, Colosses, Sepulchers with the in- 
scriptions, Lybraries with the most rare Bookes, 
Theaters, Arches, Bridges, Forts, Armories, 
Treasuries, Monasteries, Churches, publicke 
houses, Vniuersities, with their Founders, re- 
uenewes, and disputations," rulers, religion, 
commerce, and lastly coins (for him a fascinat- 
ing topic). Such a scheme is as generous as it 
is impossible, particularly for him who was as 
unmoved by literature or the fine arts as a man 
color-blind woidd be in a modem picture-gallery. 
After all, his was no purpose to entertain merely, 
for, to let him speak in his own words : " I pro- 
fesse to write especially in this place to the Hu- 
manist, I meane him that affects the knowledge 
of State affaires, Histories, Cosmography, and 
the like, and out of that I write, let other men 
apply to their vse, what they iudge fit for them." 

At the beginning of Part III. he has a dis- 
cussion of the proper persons to travel, which 
is especially valuable in these restless days when 
we all rush over-seas. Unlike Plato, he decides 
against old men from fifty to threescore, on 
account of their liability to fatal illness and 
their proneness to run into vice. Nor may 
women and children go, and married men only 
for a brief season. " But as in all actions they 
are happy that hold the meane, so middle age 
is most fit to visit forraigne parts, and to make 
vse thereof, hauing first laid a good foundation

of Arts and Sciences in general!, and specially 
those which they meane to professe, and being 
of so ripe discretion, as they can distinguish 
betweene good and euill." This passage, which 
might easily be paralleled by others from older 
English literature, helps to show how curiously 
we have now removed the boundary between 
middle and old age. Has the span of human 
life really grown greater? Moryson, writing in 
all soberness long after the event, evidently 
meant himself when he spoke of the middle- 
aged scholar as best fitted for travel, though he 
was only about twenty-five at the beginning of 
his journey abroad and not much over thirty on 
his return. Like many before him, he con- 
sidered fifty as the border of old age. 

Moryson esteemed the Germans greatly, and 
gave much space to them. He admired their 
learning, industry, frugality, and honesty, but 
thought them quarrelsome, prone to scold their 
wives, and little given to politeness. Their 
drinking habits left him in endless amazement. 
He must have enjoyed life in Italy most, if we 
may judge by the amount of space he gave that 
country, praising the Italians for their polite- 
ness and amiability, but condemning them for 
dishonesty, cowardice, and incontinency. The 
Turk, then at the height of his insolence, if not 
of his power, called forth some of the most in- 
structive passages of both books. Of one 
theme, — his own land, its inns and its men, 
even when they travel, — he never tired, though 
his comments are never long and almost never 
odious. 

" I haue obserued the Germans and French in Italy, 
to liue and conuerse most with their owne Countrimen, 
disdaining to apply themselues to the Italians language, 
apparrell, and diet, and the English aboue all others, to 
subiect themselues to the Lawes, customes, language, 
and apparrell of other Nations. And hence it is that 
the conuersation of the English abroad is wonderfuUie 
pleasing vnto strangers. Onely because they are forced 
to dissemble their Countrie among Papists, I haue found 
by experience, that other Nations, whose habit and name 
they take, haue reaped the commendation of this their 
vertue ; and it is certaine, that the Germanes, whom the 
English do often personate, haue thereupon beene often 
praysed in forraigne parts for their temperance, and 
other vertues lesse proper to them." (III., p. 23.) 

In this necessity under which the English 
labored, of having to take the habit and name 
of other nations, we have an allusion to the 
religious differences which color every page of 
the book. When Moryson returned to England 
in Italian costume, constables waited outside the 
inn to arrest him, taking him for a Jesuit or 
a priest. In Italy, travel was possible for him 
only in the disguise of a Roman Catholic Ger- 



man ; and he fled from Rome after a stay of 
only four days, for fear that the special intoler- 
ance of Easter might bring him to a prison cell. 
Yet we find unexpected toleration in parts of 
Southern Germany and Bohemia, for the Thirty 
Years' War was as yet only a distant menace. 
What we may call his asides are often inter- 
esting portions of Moryson's narrative, as illus- 
trating some idiosyncrasy of the man, or as 
wonderfully pertinent glosses on the history of 
the lif(; and customs of the times. We have 
already seen him pleasantly employed with the 
Morosinis of Venice. It is less pleasant to 
learn of his acquiring the unbreakable habit of 
going about with downcast eyes, because "a 
Turke will not abide any Christian to looke him 
full in the face without striking him." Some- 
times we rim across an unexpected bit of senti- 
ment, as in the story of the Florentine Juliet 
who kept her Romeo (I., p. 148) : 

" Neere that place lies a lane vupaued, in memory of 
a Virgin that dwelt there, whom a yong man loued, 
who was borne of a Family of a contrarie faction to 
hers, between whom many cruelties had been exercised, 
and they mutually louing each other, & despairing to 
get their friends consent for marriage, and at last being 
impatient of delay, resolued with what danger soeuer 
to meet together. But it happened, that the yong man 
being to ascend into the Virgins Chamber by a ladder, 
was surprised, who to saue the reputation of the Virgin, 
confessed that he came to rob the house, whereupon he 
was condemned to die, and being led to execution by 
the house where the Virgin dwelt, she laying aside all 
shame, came running out, with her loose haire about her 
eares, and embracing him, confessed the truth publikly, 
with which accident both their parents were so moued, 
as laying aside all former malice they contracted 
affinity, and the yoing man deliuered from the bonds of 
the hangman, was tied to her in the sweet bond of 
marriage. And of this wonderful euent, the Florentines 
thought good to keepe this memorie for posteritie." 

So, too, these comments illuminate the man- 
ner of life of the day, — the unglazed windows 
of Italy ; the bench or floor that offered the only 
chance for sleep in rural Polish inns ; the awful 
upper and nether feather beds of Germany, where 
the traveller suffered with his chance companion 
of the night ; the heated common dining-rooms 
of German inns, where men actually sat bare- 
headed ; the skates of HoUand, for which he had 
no name ; customs " proper to the English, as 
the muffling a mans face with his cloke "; the 
" Vmbrels, or things like a little Canopy ouer 
their heads," which men carry in Italy against 
the heat, though their use is dangerous, " because 
they gather the heate into a pyramidall point, 
and thence cast it downe perpendicularly vpon 
the head, except they know how to carry them 
for auoyding that danger." What visions of

things ixnutterable lie in the simple statement : 
" At the table, they [i.e., the Italians, but some- 
thing similar is said of the French elsewhere] 
touch no meate with the hand, but with a forke 
of siluer or other metall, each man being serued 
with his forke and spoone, and glasse to drinke." 
His was in many ways another England ; but 
who does not recall Pepys, muffling his face in 
his mantel, or proud, on occasion, to wear his 
hat ceremoniously indoors ?

The Dynasts.* 



It is a century since the epos of the Napoleonic 
wars filled the thoughts of mankind, and we are 
now only beginning to understand the events of 
those portentous years, and to view them in their 
true historical perspective. It may well be that 
another century shall pass before men are able 
to view in true literary perspective, and to praise 
aright, the colossal drama which Mr. Thomas 
Hardy has consecrated to the Napoleonic theme. 
When the first section of " The Dynasts " was 
published, some four years since, the impression 
made by it was chiefly one of bewilderment. 
The second section deepened that impression, 
and brought with it a more definite sense of the 
power displayed. With the third section, now 
completing the work, we become conscious of a 
precipitation, still somewhat cloudy, of the aesthe- 
tical, ethical, and philosophical elements hitherto 
held in solution, and we feel that a gi-eat task 
has been worthily performed. How worthily, 
and to what enduring effect, the distant future 
must be left to decide. Here, at least, is the 
vision vouchsafed to one of the greatest spirits 
of our time, brooding for many years over one 
of the most extraordinary themes presented by 
the history of the modern world. That the out- 
come of such a preoccupation should be mere 
futility we cannot for a moment believe. What- 
ever deductions criticism may hereafter make for 
ruggedness of form, incoherence of structure, and 
preposterous scenic investiture, there will always 
remain the sense of a great conception, power- 
fully presented, and endowed by its creator ynth. 
a strange kind of life. 

The three parts of " The Dynasts " comprise 
nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes. 
The hmnan characters are numbered by the hun- 
dreds, and to these are superadded the Phantom 
Intelligences that hover over the scene, and dis-

course upon it sub specie cetemitatis. It is to 
them that we must turn for whatever poetry we 
may expect to find in the work, for only a scant 
fraction of its bulk is to be described as being 
poetry at all. Mr. Hardy's intellectual mastery 
is such that he can at times force poetry to his 
will, but the product is never quite without traces 
of the violence employed. We feel about him 
as we feel about Emerson and Whitman, that 
the stuff of poetry is in him, but coupled with 
the obstinate determination not to submit to 
its formal restraints. The poetical high- water 
mark of the entire work was probably reached in 
the comment of the Chorus of Pities upon the 
Walcheren expedition in Part II. (quoted in 
The Dial, May 16,1906). Nothing quite equal 
to that in haunting and melancholy beauty is to 
be found in the volume now at hand. And yet 
there are single lines of infinite suggestiveness, 
such as the pathetic 

" Disasters mostly have to do with ine " 

of the Empress Marie Louise ; brief passages of 
biting force or amazing vision, such as these 
words of Davout at first sight of Moscow i 

" What scores of bulbous church-tops gild the sky ! 
Souls must be rotten in this region, sire, 
To need so much repairing ! " 

or these of the Spirit of the Pities upon the field 

of Waterloo : 

" Between the jars 
Of those who live, I hear uplift and move 
The bones of those who placidly have lain 
Within the sacred garths of yon grey fanes — 
Nivelles and Plancenoit, and others nigh. 
Where faith is vibrant still — through untold years. 
Their dry jaws quake: 'What Sabaoth is this, 
That shakes us in our unobtrusive shrouds. 
As though our tissues did not yet abhor 
The fevered feats of life ? ' " 

Probably the finest long passage is offered by 
the last monologue of Napoleon, fleeing for his 
life after the final defeat of his insensate ambi- 
tion. It is midnight, he is drowsing in the saddle, 
and the voice of the Spirit Ironic penetrates to 
his consciousness with the question : 

" So I would ask, Ajaccian Bonaparte, 
Has all this been worth while ? " 

Here is the monologue in full : 

" O cursed hour. 
Why am I stung by spectral questionings ? 
Did not my clouded soul incline to match 
Those of the corpses yonder, thou should'st rue 
Thy saying. Fiend, whoever thou may'st be ! . . . 

Why did the death-drops fail to bite me close 
I took at Fontainebleau ? Had I then ceased 
This deep had been unplumbed; had they but worked, 
I had thrown three-fold the glow of Hannibal 
Down History's dusky lanes ! — Is it too late ? . . . 
Yea. Self-sought death would smoke but damply here !

If but a Kremlin cannon shot had met me 
My greatness would have stood: I should have scored 
A vast repute, scarce paralleled in time. 
As it did not, the fates had served me best 
If in the thick and thunder of to-day, 
Like Nelson, Harold, Hector, Cyrus, Saul, 
I had been shifted from this jail of flesh. 
To wander as a greatened ghost elsewhere. 

Yes, a good death, to have died on yonder field ; 

But never a ball came passing down my way ! 

So, as it is, a miss-mark they will dub me; 
And yet — I found the crown of France in the mire, 
And with the point of my prevailing sword 
I picked it up ! But for all this and this 
I shall be nothing. . . . 

To shoulder Christ from out the topmost niche 
In human fame, as once I fondly felt. 
Was not for me. I came too late in time 
To assume the prophet or the demi-god, 
A part past playing now. My only course 
To make good showance to posterity 
Was to implant my line upon the throne. 
And how shape that, if now extinction nears ? 
Great men are meteors that consume themselves 
To light the earth. This is my burnt-out hour." 

The seven acts which this closing section 
of the work comprises deal with the Russian 
expedition, the final passages of the Peninsular 
campaign, the defeat of Leipzig, the exile to 
Elba, and the Belgian campaign that ended on 
the field of Waterloo. Many scenes of subor- 
dinate interest are interspersed, taking us, now 
to London, now to Malmaison, now to the 
Wessex coast, now to Vienna and Schonbrunn. 
The stage-directions are more amazing than 
ever, as the following examples witness : 

" The unnatural light before seen usurps that of the 
sun, bringing into view, Uke breezes made visible, the 
.films or brain-tissues of the Immanent Will, that 
pervade all things, ramifying through the whole army. 
Napoleon included, and moving them to Its inexplicable 
artistries." 

" Thereupon a vision passes before Napoleon as he 
lies, comprising hundreds of thousands of skeletons and 
corpses in various stages of decay. They rise from his 
various battlefields, the flesh dropping from them, and 
gaze reproachfully at him. His intimate officers slain 
he recognizes among the crowd. In front is the Duke 
of Enghien as showman." 

The imagination that stage-directed the second 
part of " Faust " did not transcend the possible 
to this extent. As for the Phantom Intelli- 
gences, the Spirits of Rumour, and of the Pities 
and of the Years, the Spirits Sinister and Ironic, 
they are present everywhere, commenting singly 
or in choral unison upon the scenes, as they are 
successively enacted upon the earthly stage. 

K it is to these Phantom Intelligences that 
we must look for the poetry of Mr. Hardy's 
work, it is to them also that we must turn for 
its philosophy. As those who have read the 



earlier sections of the work already know, this 
is a philosophy that embodies the central doc- 
trine of Schopenhauer — the doctrine of a blind, 
unconscious, and aimless will immanent in all 
things, and unwitting of any definite purpose. 
"Why prompts the Will so senseless-shaped a doing?" 
asks the Spirit of the Pities ; and the Spirit of 
the Years makes answer : 

" I have told thee that It works unwittingly, 
As one possessed, not judging." 

Whatever light the author has for the darkness 
of his fellow-men, perplexed by the seemingly 
meaningless tragedy of existence, must be 
sought in that impressive " After Scene " in 
the Overworld, when Europe is visible only in 
the dim distance, and the Phantom Intelligences 
alone occupy the stage. 

SpiRrr OF THE Years. 
" Thus doth the Great Foresightless mechanize 
In blank entrancement now as evermore 
Its ceaseless artistries in Circumstance 
Of curious stuff and braid, as just forthshown. 

Yet but one flimsy riband of Its web 
Have we here watched in weaving — web Enorme, 
Whose furthest hem and selvage may extend 
To where the roars and plashings of the flames 
Of earth-invisible suns swell noisily. 
And onwards into ghastly gulfs of sky. 
Where hideous presences churn through the dark — 
Monsters of magnitude without a shape, 
Hanging amid deep wells of nothingness. 
Yet seems this vast and singular confection 
Wherein our scenery glints of scantest size. 
Inutile all — so far as reasonings tell." 

Spirit of the Pities. 
" Thou arguest still the Inadvertent Mind, — 
But, even so, shall blankness be for aye ? 
Men gained cognition with the flux of time. 
And wherefore not the Force informing them. 
When far-ranged aions past all fathoming 
Shall have swung by, and stand as backward years ? " 

Here may be noted Mr. Hardy's point of de- 
parture from the Schopenhauerian conception 
of the Will. With the German philosopher, the 
Will may attain to consciousness only in its indi- 
vidual objectification, and then only to the effect 
of an act of negation and consequent world- 
annihUation ; with the English poet the Will 
may become conscious in its cosmic character, 
and acquire positive purpose wherewith to shape 
a more rational world. The distinction is fun- 
damental. And thus the Will is invoked by the 
Pities in chorus: 

" We hold that Thy unscanted scope 
Affords a food for final Hope, 
That mild-eyed Consciousness stands nigh 
Life's loom, to lull it by and by." 

The Spirit Ironic interposes a last objection :

" As once a Greek asked I would fain ask too, 
Who knows if all the Spectacle be true, 
Or an illusion of the gods (the Will, 
To wit) some hocus-pocus to fulfil ? " 

And the final answer of the Pities is thus voiced : 

« But — a stirring thrills the air 
Like to sounds of joyance there 
That the rages 
Of the ages 
Shall be cancelled, and deliverance offered from the 

darts that were. 
Consciousness the Will informing, till It fashion aU 
things fair." 

This, if less ecstatic in utterance, is at one with 
the Chorus Mysticus that brings " Faust" to its 
sublime close. It is the impressive last word 
to mankind of a spirit that has faced life steadily, 
swept all illusions from the field of its vision, 
and yet has preserved the faith to believe that 
the world-process may eventuate in an ultimate

The American Nation: 1865-1907.* 

The appearance of the Index volume of " The 
American Nation " brings to a close a work that 
long before its completion has commended itself to 
all students of American history. The scholarship 
which has characterized the series as a whole, the 
convenient and tasteful form in which the volumes 
have been presented to the public, and the prompt- 
ness with which the publication has been carried 
through, have elicited admiration which is hardly 
qualified by the necessity of reading ten thousand 
pages, by the possible loss of individuality incident 
to a cooperative history, or by the repetition which 
is unavoidable in a work of this kind. 

Of the six volumes now before us, four contain 
the narrative of the United States from the Civil 
War to the present time, one is an index, and one is 
an essay, by the editor, upon American history. The 
first volume of this group covers the period of Recon- 
struction, and in it Professor Dunning, whose essays 
on Reconstruction have for a decade stimulated all 
students of this period in our history, has written, in 
an easy and attractive style, another book that will 
be a necessary guide to students in this especial 
field. The author expresses his gratification that 
Mr. Rhodes's last two volumes appeared in time for

him to use them; and it is of interest to compare 
the longer and the more concise treatments of the 
same epoch. 

Of late years no field of American history has 
been more industriously exploited than this Recon- 
struction period, — especially with reference to the 
fate of individual States. The resulting monographs 
Professor Dunning has used with discriminating 
care. Besides, he has broken the path into some 
new and important sources, notably the papers of 
Andrew Johnson in the Library of Congress. But 
behind all this is the thoughtful consideration which 
the author for many years has given to the problems 
of that time. The result is a fresh treatment which 
in many ways departs from the traditional accounts, 
which is marked by the absence of doctrinaire asser- 
tions, and reveals a detached yet sympathetic feeling. 
Thus, in the case of the labor laws of the Southern 
States, passed at the very close of the war, it is 
emphasized by Professor Dunning that while such 
legislation was not tactful politically, and some 
examples of it were to be condemned as cruel and 
oppressive, the general purpose in the minds of those 
who enacted this body of law was an entirely reason- 
able and just one. Again, the quarrel between 
President Johnson and Congress is relieved to some 
extent of the intensely personal character which has 
attached to it, by the recognition of the fact that 
there was a more fundamental question involved, — 
the conflict of the executive with the legislative 
branch of the government. 

Notwithstanding the necessary compression of a 
volume which has so much to tell, one of its most 
delightful features is the description of the person- 
alities which in Congress or in ofiice swayed the 
Nation's thought. The great trio, Thaddeus Stevens, 
Charles Sumner, and Henry Wilson, are handled 
without much reverence. In the case of the first, 
" a keen and relentlessly logical mind, an ever ready 
gift of biting sarcasm and stinging repartee, and a 
total lack of scruple as to means in the pursuit of a 
legislative end, secured him an ascendency in the 
House which none of his party associates ever 
dreamed of disputing." Sumner, however, "made 
himself felt in a far different way. His forte was 
exalted moral fervor and humanitarian idealism. 
He lived in the empyrean, and descended thence 
upon his colleagues with dogmas that he discovered 
there. . . . He was the perfect type of that narrow 
fanaticism which erudition and egotism combine 
to produce, and to which political crises alone give 
the opportunity for actual achievement." Henry 
Wilson's "sympathy for the down-trodden was no 
less demonstrative than his colleague's," but his 
" tears in their flow never for a moment distorted 
his count of the votes to be gained for his party." 
Finally, George S. Boutwell is described as " desti- 
tute of Sumner's erudition and egotism and of 
Wilson's cant, but exemplifying perfectly the hard 
merciless type which the Puritan conscience makes 
of a mediocre man."

tions of Grant, with their varying currents of politics, 
to the disputed election of 1876, and the decision 
rendered by the electoral Commission in favor of 
Hayes. The story of the failure of Reconstruction 
in the South gives place to that of the economic 
development of the North and the depressing public 
scandals that disgraced the Republican rule. There 
is a chapter upon the judicial interpretation of 
Reconstruction : and if any fault-iinding were in 
order, we might be disposed to place it here and 
ask for a larger expression of Professor Dunning's 
judgment as an historian on the relation to the facts 
of Reconstruction of the theories as to the location 
of sovereignty in the United States which different 
writers or different parties advanced. Perhaps this 
question has been anticipated, and the answer sug- 
gested, by Professor Dunning, when he says that 
"the final steps in reconstruction revealed with 
unmistakable clearness the truth of the southern 
view that a new Union had been created." 

It is expressly stated that the book is not to be 
merely a chapter of Southern history, but is to adopt 
and maintain a national outlook. Thus matters of 
diplomacy, of transcontinental railroad building, of 
national finance, as well as matters of national poli- 
tics, all have their place. Yet after all has been said, 
one cannot lay the volume down without the feeling 
that the centre of interest historically as well as 
dramatically lies in the processes by which the 
Southern States of the Union passed from the years 
of warfare to that condition of things which, for 
good or ill, has been and has thus far remained, " the 
Solid South." It is, however, in the highest degree 
desirable and important that we should ever be 
reminded that even when apparently the isolation 
was most complete, and certainly the feeling of sec- 
tionalism was most intense, this history was but a 
part of a larger history : something which will be 
more and more realized both in thp South and in 
the North. 

The titles of the next three volumes, — " National 
Development," " National Problems," and " America 
the World Power," — suggest at first sight a topical 
treatment. As a matter of fact each book treats of 
much the same topics, within the limits of a decade, 
more or less ; and together they cover the events of 
the last generation, from 1877 to 1907. Thus the 
first of these three, written by Professor E. E. 
Sparks, brings the narrative down to the election of 
Cleveland in 1884 ; in the second. Professor Davis 
R. Dewey continues it to the campaign of 1896 ; 
while the story of the last ten years, including 
especially the account of the Spanish- American 
"War, is left to Professor John H. Latan^. Through 
all the volumes run many threads that are the same : 
the course of party conflict, the growth of foreign 
policy, the various phases of the economic develop- 
ment of the Nation. 

Professor Sparks shows the fundamental changes 
that marked the close of the epoch of Reconstruction : 
it is significant that political history as such is not 



taken up before the sixth chapter of his book and 
then commands a relatively limited space. It is the 
recital of economic facts, and the statement of nascent 
economic problems, that gives the book its distinc- 
tion. Of course many of these economic facts and 
problems were, or soon became, intimately connected 
with politics, and thus the tariff, the currency, the 
expansion of inland commerce, and kindred subjects 
have been made the basis of partisan appeals to 
voters. But Professor Sparks begins with an 
account of the Exposition of 1876, with its expres- 
sion of the new spirit of the American people, — 
the spirit of business enterprise now entering into a 
larger stage of activity, and prepared to do larger 
things than the men of the earlier Union could have 
dreamed of. 

Careful study is thus devoted to the population 
of the country as it stood when the last quarter of 
the nineteenth century began, and later a chapter is 
given to the Immigration problem and one to the 
question of Chinese exclusion. There is a succinct 
account of the progress of invention and discovery, 
especially in the fields of electrical and mechani- 
cal engineering. Another chapter tells of the earlier 
phases of railroad development that marked the period 
under review, pointing out the favor with which the 
Government, in the Act of 1866, had viewed the 
unification of railroad systems in trunk lines, as con- 
trasted with the later hostility to consolidations. The 
wider change of sentiment towards the roads which 
expressed itself in the Granger movement is dis- 
cussed, with helpful reference to the reports of early 
congressional committees upon the subject. In this 
way the reader is led up to the Interstate Commerce 
Act of 1887, which is treated at length in the suc- 
ceeding volume. Quite as valuable is the chapter 
upon industrial problems, where the agitation for a 
shorter working day, the extension into too familiar 
use of the ancient methods of the " strike " and the 
" boycott," the growth of organization as expressed 
in the " Knights of Labor," the weakness of militia 
in the face of labor difficulties, and the power of the 
Courts, are shown to have very soon called attention 
to the desirability of peace between labor and capital, 
and to have moved Congress to the initial step of 
creating, in 1884, a bureau of labor statistics. 

In the political part of the volume, the central 
theme is found in the factional fights of parties, and 
the concurrent struggles in the direction of civil ser- 
vice reform. The forces which led to the defeat of 
Blaine are clearly analyzed. The prominence of 
the West in National affairs which is revealed so 
clearly by the author was, of course, no new pheno- 
menon, but Professor Sparks brings out the social 
and economic conditions which regmphasized the 
influence of the West ; and thus the Mormons, the 
Indian tribes, and the interests of the cowboys and 
ranchmen, miners and railroad kings, appear with 
that effect of romance which we have since attri- 
buted to the " West." Only one important topic 
seems to have been neglected, or left to another 
place — the cultural development of the country.

The frontispiece to the volume is a portrait of James 
Russell Lowell ; but as the name of that distin- 
guished diplomat and man of letters does not appear 
in Professor Sparks's book, the picture would seem 
to be an overflow from the last volume of the text. 

If in the volumes thus far discussed the approach 
of the present has made itself felt, this becomes far 
stronger as one turns to the works of Professor 
Dewey and Professor Latan^. In the former of 
these, the personality of President Cleveland takes 
the first place: the book covers his two terms of 
office, with the intervening administration of Presi- 
dent Harrison. Professor Dewey comments on the 
difficulties of the treatment of recent history : the 
unavailability of private papers, the overwhelming 
mass of detail not yet sifted and criticized, and the 
troubling question of proper perspective. He applies 
these to such definite problems as "the relations of 
Cleveland to the ' reactionary spoilsmen ' of his first 
administration, the origin of the tariff message of 
1887, the failure of Sherman to secure the presiden- 
tial nomination in 1888, the relations of Harrison 
and Blaine and the sudden resignation of the latter, 
and the swerving in our foreign policy marked 
by the Venezuelan message," — problems which, he 
says, " have still to be definitely interpreted by the 
historian." But notwithstanding these admitted 
limitations as to material and depth of treatment. 
Professor Dewey has given a political history of 
these twelve years that is admirable in every respect. 
It is a period that demands able handling, for the 
currents and counter-currents of American politics 
are peculiarly confused and especially important. 
Not only were the executive and one or the other 
branch of Congress during much of this time of 
different political faith, but within the parties there 
was positive disagreement. 

But while the history of parties and party leaders, 
and the narrative of our diplomatic affairs, are so 
satisfactorily carried through these years, the strik- 
ing characteristic of the volume (as the other 
writings of the author would lead one to expect) is 
the masterly discussion of economic questions. 
These are the real " National Problems " suggested 
in the title of the book, — the varying fortunes of 
the protective tariff, the development of organized 
labor, the growth of trusts, the further attempts to 
regulate railroads, and especially the evolution of the 
monetary system of the country and the activity of 
the friends of the free and unlimited coinage of 
silver. The last topic, both in its special form and 
in its general relation to public finance, is treated 
extensively in four chapters scattered through the 
work, the last of which, that upon the campaign of 
1896, brings the book to a close with no little 
dramatic effect. The defeat of Mr. Bryan is attri- 
buted to the fear felt towar* his policies by the 
business interests of the country, rather than to 
"deep-seated popular adherence to the principles of 
the Republican party." There is also a sharp word 
of criticism for the Democrats, and " the bickerings 



and dissensions which humiliated the Democratic 
administration." President Cleveland, concludes 
Professor Dewey, " was sacrificed by his party ; 
but even his enemies respected his consistency and 
firmness, and in later years have hastened to pay 
tribute which was denied when he retired from 
office." 

It is a coincidence not without interest that the 
first volume of Professor Hart's series that treated 
the narrative of English-speaking America was 
written by a student of history from the oldest of 
the colonies, — President Lyon G. Tyler of William 
and Mary College in Virginia, while the last narra- 
tive volume is the work of a younger scholar of the 
same State, — Professor John H. Latand of Wash- 
ington and Lee. The work of the former dealt 
with English settlements before 1660, but chiefly 
with the development of Virginia ; in the latter's 
volume the National spirit of the new era is pre- 
dominant. In fact, one might almost substitute the 
word international, for the larger part of Professor 
Latan^'s book is concerned with the events that have 
removed the United States from the old-time isola- 
tion into the field of world-politics. 

The social and economic problems of National 
importance, made so prominent in the volumes just 
preceding, are here disappointingly compressed into 
two chapters, where one finds, for example, but the 
briefest mention of the federal Railroad Rate law 
of 1906. Two chapters are devoted to the two last 
Presidential elections. The remainder of the book 
is easily divisible into two halves. The first carries 
the story of the Spanish-American War from the 
intervention in Cuba through the peace negotiations 
of 1898-1899 and the Philippine Insurrection. Here 
one finds a careful narrative without any spirit of 
jingoism ; and if the style be here and there some- 
what journalistic, that is perhaps unavoidable in writ- 
ing of events so fresh in the public mind and thus 
far handled so exclusively in that manner. The 
second division to which we have referred lies within 
Professor Latan^'s chosen metier, in which his earlier 
writings have won him distinction. This is the his- 
tory of diplomacy, and the central theme of this 
volume is the "sphere of international relations in 
which America is undoubtedly destined to play a 
larger part." This is elaborated in interesting and 
valuable chapters upon the Spanish-American Peace 
negotiations, American Diplomacy in the Orient, the 
Alaskan Boundary, the Panama Canal, our relations 
to Cuba and the Monroe Doctrine, and, finally, the 
very vital topics of international arbitration and the 
forcible collection of debts due from one State to 
another. 

In his development of diplomatic history, the 
author treats not merely the technique of foreign 
affairs but the wider economic and constitutional 
effects of diplomatic action. In a tone thoroughly 
controlled and impartial, he reviews the Supreme 
Court's decisions in the Insular cases, concluding that 
commercial and political interests decided the con-

stitutional position of our new possessions before the 
Supreme Court took up the cases, and that the Court's 
decisions, " confusing and unsatisfactory as they were 
from the standpoint of constitutional law," simply 
recognized un fait accompli. In the case of the 
Panama Canal and the secession of Panama from 
Colombia, the author indulges in a couple of 
paragraphs of very keen and clear criticism of the 
President's public ethics, remarking that full accept- 
ance of the President's public arguments " involved 
the recognition of the President as the agent of col- 
lective civilization, clothed with the power of regu- 
lating the international right of eminent domain." 

The chapters • on international arbitration, the 
Monroe Doctrine, and the collection of public debts 
by foreign nations are closely inter-connected : in- 
deed the author considers that the last topic 
constitutes the most recent phase of the Monroe 
Doctrine. He gives an excellent summary of the 
developments in Venezuela and Santo Domingo, clos- 
ing with a discussion of the unsatisfactory status in 
which the question has been left by the third Inter- 
national Conference of American States held at Rio 
Janeiro in July, 1906, and by the Second Peace Con- 
ference at the Hague, in 1907. 

In the final volume of the series. Professor Hart, 
as editor of the texts, considers American ideals 
from the standpoint of their historical development. 
The sixteenth volume, also contributed by him, was 
a discussion of the connected topics of slavery and 
abolition. This new volume is a review of American 
life in general. The author lays stress upon the his- 
torical or evolutionary treatment which differentiates 
his work from Bryce's " American Commonwealth." 
Professor Hart wishes to prove that "we are own 
brothers to our great-grandfathers." He thus recap- 
itulates American history along the great lines of 
geographic environment, race and social conditions, 
American government, and social and economic 
activities, concluding with a prospect of the future 
of American democracy. The book is a collection of 
summaries and generalizations, some of which seem 
strong and clear, others, such as the discussion of cul- 
tural development, much less satisfactory. Certain 
fundamental assumptions would be expected : sov- 
ereignty rested in the Continental Congress rather 
than in the States ; the Puritans have furnished " the 
little leaven that leavens the whole lump." But in 
general the outlook is one distinctly broad and 
sympathetic. Professor Hart recognizes the incon- 
sistency with the theoretical democracy of Lincoln 
of the settlement, after the Spanish-American War, 
of the Philippine question; but this inconsistency 
does not discourage his hope for the future. The 
failures of Democracy include the lack of discrimina- 
tion between high things and low, the toleration by 
Americans of poor city government, the contempt 
of expert opinion, intense party feeling, the love 
for excitement and the sensational press, the exist- 
ence of scandalous corruption, and the possibility of 
class rivalry. These defects are strongly put : what 



is lacking is the deeper philosophical analysis of 
what Democracy really is, — or rather, what it is to 
be in the future. 

Well worthy of approbation is the " Analytic 
Index " to the series, prepared by Mr. D. M. 
Matteson of the Harvard University Library. In 
a work of this sort minor inaccuracies will occur, 
such as the failure to distinguish between the two 
persons named Daniel Dulany. These are trifles, 
however, in view of the immense serviceableness of 
the Index to the twenty-six volumes, with general 
topical references also carefully worked out. It is 
asking too much, perhaps, and aiming at something 
too difficult of accomplishment, to expect such an 
Index to include more than it does of the biblio- 
graphical matter ; to reach this in unified form one 
has Larned's Bibliography and similar works. 

As a word of conclusion, in leaving this note- 
worthy addition to the literature of American history, 
we may express an opinion as to its chief usefulness. 
As a work of reference it should be in every library. 
It will be of especial value to teachers. To the 
general reader single volumes will appeal, and 
thus popularize a scientific treatment of history. It 
is, however, far too extensive to be a " popular " 
history. On the other hand, only some of its 
volumes will serve the purposes of the specialist. 
With its many excellences, it is to be questioned 
whether the series as a whole has demonstrated the 
impossibility or the uselessness of the attempt to 
attain unity or uniformity in the work of a single 
master hand. g^. George L. Sioxjssat. 



Briefs on New Books. 



„ ,^ ,„ . A companion volume to the Abb^ 
Father Kletn -,^, . , , -r i t ^ p ^\^ c^^ 
among his Klein s " In the Land oi the btren- 

own people. uous Life " is now issued by the same 

publishers (McClurg). "An American Student in 
France," admirably translated, as was the earlier 
work, by the accomplished author, and generously 
illustrated, presents the author's conception of the 
way things French impress an inquiring, observant, 
and serious-minded American student of about 
twenty-one years of age. The student is a compos- 
ite type, and, naturally, somewhat idealized ; hence 
not thoroughly real and " convincing " to the reader. 
But that does not prevent one's deriving a good deal 
of entertainment and instruction from the Abba's 
frank and comrade-like talks on various subjects 
of historic, political, religious, and literary interest, 
whosoever may serve as ostensible mouth-piece from 
page to page. Certain well-known cities, — as Paris, 
Versailles, Rouen, — are visited by the imaginary 
American youth, and %ther regions less familiar, — 
as Quercy, Tarn, and Auvergne, " where one can 
see," the author says, "along with charming and 
curious landscapes, the most striking examples of 
our ancient manners." He apologizes for the con-

siderable space accorded to current politico-religious 
discussions, and notably to the separation of Church 
and State, questions which he regards as among the 
most important that have arisen in France for a cen- 
tury. His views on the separation referred to may 
be gathered from the imaginary discussions of the 
subject in his book. He is broad-minded and looks 
at the matter from more than one point of view, but 
what he has put into the mouth of an imaginary 
French bishop is presumably the expression of his 
own opinion, " More important still than this 
material readjustment," says the bishop toward the 
end of a long harangue, " appears to us the moral 
renovation which the separation regime will impose 
on the clergy and the faithful. Henceforth the 
clergy, being in contact with the realities of existence 
and at the same time obliged to see, consult with, 
interest their people, and render account to them, 
will acquire a truer idea of modern life and its exi- 
gencies ; it will become more indulgent, while its 
qualities of initiative and intelligence will be devel- 
oped." In comparing things American with what 
is encountered on French soU, the Abb^, or the 
Abba's " student," is not invariably trustworthy. 
For example, after referring to Jeanne d'Arc, " the 
heroine who was burnt alive for witchcraft in 1431," 
the American visitor says : " I blush to think that 
at home, in New England, as late as the year 1692, 
the heads of twenty-eight victims were cut off, eight 
in one day, under this same insane pretext." As a 
matter of historic fact, in 1692, at the height of the 
Salem witchcraft frenzy, nineteen persons were 
hanged (not beheaded) on Gallows Hill, and one 
old man, Giles Corey, was pressed to death for refus- 
ing to plead. Father Klein is a writer to com- 
mand attention at all times, but he is not in quite so 
happy a vein in impersonating the American visitor 
to France as he was in playing the French visitor 
to America. 

Modern progress ^^ ''Chapters in Rural Progress" 
of the rural (University of Chicago Press), Mr. 

community. Kenyon L. Butterfield presents a col- 

lection of addresses and magazine articles grouped 
imder a few general headings but all bearing on the 
same topic. The author is President of the Massa- 
chusetts Agricultural College, and has written and 
spoken much on a subject that he evidently has close 
at heart. He disarms criticism somewhat by calling 
attention to the fact that his book has the limitations 
of collected papers ; yet one questions if it would not 
have been more effective if the materials had been 
worked over and welded together more compactly. 
However, many of the chapters are admirably suited 
to be read before farmer's institutes, grange meet- 
ings, and agricultural schools — such audiences as 
first heard them from the author. The central 
thought running through all is the vital importance 
of the personal progress and development of the 
American farmer, if he is to hold his own in this 
swiftly moving century. This advancement must be 
not merely technical but cultural, — not superficial 



but real, based on a wide and deep knowledge of the 
problems of the farm and the farmer. " The farm 
problem consists in maintaining upon our farms a 
class of people who have succeeded in procuring for 
themselves the highest possible class status, not only 
in the industrial but in the political and social order, 
— a relative status, moreover, that is measured by 
the demands of American ideals." The author then 
shows how the " old farmer," with his sterling quali- 
ties, who furnished the backbone to earlier Amer- 
ican life, has merged into the " new farmer," with 
advanced ideas and the energy of progress, and how 
both are in marked contrast to the " moss-back." 
The section on " Agencies of Progress " gives his- 
torical sketches of the Farmers' Institutes, the 
Grange, and the more recent " Hesperia Movement," 
describing also the valuable work these agencies are 
accomplishing to-day ; it treats of the rural school 
and the community, opportunities for farm women, 
the country church and progress, sketches what edu- 
cation may mean to the farmer, and gives a summary 
of recent progress. Mr. Butterfield emphasizes the 
high service of educated women on the farm, the 
beneficial influence they may have on the community 
as well as on their homes, becoming a power in 
their generation and those to follow. " An Untilled 
Field in American Education " urges the study of 
agricultural economics and of rural sociology, not 
only in agricultural colleges but also in normal 
schools, theological seminaries, and universities, 
from which go the teachers and clergymen and 
editors who may wield the greatest power in their 
communities. The final chapter is entitled " Feder- 
ation for Rural Progress," and here the author lays 
stress on the subject as it is to be developed outside 
of the schools, his idea being that all the social 
agencies — granges, institutes, all societies bearing 
on rural subjects of any sort, " country teachers, 
preachers, editors, doctors, and business men, and, 
more than all, intelligent and progressive farmers " — 
should so federate in a " League for Social Progress " 
(of which he gives examples in leagues now exist- 
ing) that their work shall not be duplicated but ex- 
tended, that every phase of the rural problem shall 
be met by an adequate solution, that the specialist 
and the practical man shall come together, and that 
the cooperation of individuals shall merge into the 
cooperation of interests. We regret to note a few 
such solecisms as " grand business proposition " and 
" enthuse," but in general the book is written in a 
simple and direct fashion that suits the subject. It 
should be in the hands of all who are in any way 
interested in rural progress, from the farmer to the 
school trustee.

lectual or spiritual aspect of the subject — although 
it is true that he intends " to indicate everywhere a 
triune ideal of normal well-being and happiness." 
His philosophy of right living — of training sym- 
metrically body and mind and soul — he ventures to 
call a " triunistic or unitrinian philosophy," the word 
" trinitarian " being preempted for another and a 
universally recognized purpose. At the outset the 
author does well to remind the reader that " the 
culture of personality ... is a very complex and 
subtle process. It is not accomplished by the ac- 
quiring of knowledge and the adoption of morality 
alone, but by every moment's life of the body, — 
every deed, every word, every gesture, — by the 
deliberate training of exercise and regimen, by the 
long course of habitual occupation, and by every 
brief act of each irrevocable instant. We not only 
transform our outward bodily persons by what we 
are, making them simulacra of our inmost selves, but 
in sober truth our most essential selves are in their 
turn reflexly transformed by the reacting influence 
of our physical habits and doing^." This will sug- 
gest to many, as it did to the author, the stanza 
from " Rabbi Ben Ezra " ending, " nor soul helps 
flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul ! " And it is 
not surprising to find many pages of the book devoted 
to such themes as the form and function of the 
human foot, the art of walking correctly and of breath- 
ing properly, dancing as a fine art, the rhythm of 
grace, the sorcery of the hand, the importance of 
manners, and the notorious disregard of much that 
is hygienic and aesthetic in our dress. It is the 
Greek beauty of life that we are to realize anew, by 
proper attention to rhythmic grace of motion, to 
harmonious training of all parts of the body, and to 
the acquisition of that tunefulness of the whole being 
to which our latter-day devotion to narrower and 
narrower specialties is so hostile. Of athletics as 
practised in this day and generation Mr. Carman 
has a poor opinion : he regrets that " college athletics, 
which might have so great an influence for nobility 
and beauty in forming American manhood, are 
actually always too near exhibitionary gladiatorial 
professionalism, and tend to vulgarize and brutalize 
their students." The lesson of the book, it is need- 
less to add, is taught with a richness and poetic 
charm of style that make each successive chapter a 
new delight. Philosophy has been defined as poetry 
addressed to the understanding, just as poetry has 
been called philosophy addressed to the emotions. 
Mr. Carman's book is both philosophy and poetry, 
and its appeal is twofold. 

" Who 's Who in America " has now 
Who 1st'* ? reached its fifth biennial issue, and 

is thicker and more useful than ever. 
As compared with the first issue, the present one 
has three times the number of pages and nearly 
twice the number of biographies. It now gives us, 
in its twenty-four hundred closely printed pages, 
the essential facts about more than sixteen thousand 
living Americans. An important feature, now for 



the first time incorporated in the work, is a geo- 
graphical index, which brings together all the names 
of those living in any given city, state, or foreign 
country. It shows, for example, that about eight 
hundred Chicagoans are distinguished enough for 
inclusion in the work. The last entry in this index 
is as follows : " Wales, Craig y Nos Castle, Patti, 
Adelina, prima donna." The editor, Mr. Albert 
Nelson Marquis, contributes a preface which is both 
instructive and entertaining. It is the former be- 
cause it gives some valuable statistical gleanings 
from the work, and it is the latter because it reflects 
some of the humorously diversified opinions of the 
editor's multitudinous correspondents. Perhaps the 
most amusing of these opinions is that of the clergy- 
man who calls it " a vicious book, because it seeks to 
establish a man's worth in the world by the position 
he occupies." The editor does not claim too much 
when he says, with pardonable pride, that the work 
"has achieved a world-wide recognition as something 
fixed and requisite." Coming to us at the same time 
as its American prototype, we welcome the new vol- 
ume of " Wer Ist's ? " (New York: Stechert). This 
is the third issue of the work, which is described 
as " voUkommen neu bearbeitet und wesentlich 
erweitert." About eighteen thousand biographies 
are included, thus surpassing by about two thousand 
the American list. We understand that the idea of 
these books has now reached France, and that a 
" Qui Etes-Vous ? " volume has recently been pro- 
duced. This, however, has not yet come to our hand. 

Random "^^^ ^e\. Patrick Augustine Sheehan, 

reflections of Canon of Cloyne, poet, essayist, and 
an Irish Canon, novelist, has issued a companion 
volume to " Under the Cedars and the Stars," and 
has given it the unassuming title, " Parerga " (Long- 
mans). Grouped under the four seasons, beginning 
with Autumn, this collection of obiter dicta is devoted 
largely, and very acceptably, to brief comments on 
books and writers and the high themes of life, with 
just enough passing reference to the changing 
year to render the four division-headings not too 
meaningless. Like many idealists who lead an 
existence insufficiently rich in mundane interests 
and engrossments — domestic, social, civic, and 
commercial — this author has apparently failed to 
bring the ideal and the real into any tolerable modus 
vivendi. While he well says that "idealism . . . 
is the fulcrum, the only fulcrum, with which an 
Archimedean spirit can move, and lift, the human 
race," he is constrained to believe that " poets and 
philosophers and dreamers must keep steadily at 
their task, ' weaving by night and day the magic 
web,' and never turning to watch in the bald and 
bare realities of life the replica of the fairy images 
wrought by the spell of imagination in the mirror 
of their own fancies." He does not hesitate to 
assert that "the world has become hopelessly and 
irredeemably vulgar," that "the spirit of evil is 
everywhere," and that " every poet who turns away 
from his magic mirror and stares boldly at the

realities of human existence becomes a confirmed 
pessimist." These are strong statements. But, 
surely, while there are in the world books like 
" Parerga " and writers like the Canon of Cloyne, 
that world is not quite " hopelessly and irredeemably 
vulgar." Let us wish for him that some day he 
may encounter some soul-stirring (perhaps even 
some heart-breaking) experience of reality to dissi- 
pate these vapors. An attractive feature of the 
volume is its occasional appreciative comment on 
Shakespeare ; but even in the midst of this the 
author pulls himseK up to ask, "What. is it that 
repels me in Shakespeare ? " and he continues : " I 
admit all his intellectual vastness and greatness. He 
stands alone ; or Dante alone may stand unabashed 
by his side. Yet I cannot read him with pleasure, 
but always as a study. And I cannot read him for 
profit, even though he has my fullest meed of admir- 
ation." One " valid reason " for this he thinks to 
be that Shakespeare's plays " were written for tjie 
stage, not for the closet ; for the glare of footlights, 
not for the student's lamp." Such a mixture of 
critical appreciation and temperamental aversion 
has rarely been brought to the study of Shakespeare 
as manifests itself, again and again, in Canon 
Sheehan's pages. For this and other reasons the 
book is far from being commonplace or dull. 

Mr. John R. Spears, who has already 
Z'u^TnZv^. given to the public a history of the 

Navy in five volumes and an abridg- 
ment of it in one volume, now presents a third work 
on the same subject in a single volume (Scribner). 
The new book is more than an abridgment of the 
larger work or an amplification of the smaller one, for 
it is based in part upon a new reading of the sources. 
The author says in his preface that he " has been 
animated by a desire to tell, in one convenient vol- 
ume that might be sold at a moderate price, the 
whole story of our navy, — to describe all the import- 
ant battles, and to show how the nation has been 
affected at certain times by the work of its naval 
ships and at other times by the want of such a force." 
He has fairly succeeded in accomplishing his object 
as set forth in these words ; he has written a popular 
history of our navy, convenient in size, plain and 
straightforward in style, and generally accurate as 
to facts. At times his judgment is immoderate, — 
as, for instance, when he says that Lawrence was 
" first on the list of foolhardy " (p. 102) ; that New 
England in June, 1812, was full of traitors (p. 86) ; 
and that the battle between the " Constitution " and 
the " Guerrifere " saved the navy and the nation (p. 87 ) . 
Some fault might also be foimd with the author's 
arrangement of his materials. There seems to be 
no good reason why a chapter on the origin of the 
War of 1812 should precede one on the war with 
Tripoli, 1801-1805 ; or why the engagement between 
the " President " and « Little Belt," 1811, should 
come after the principal fights of the year 1812. 
But these are minor defects in a generally creditable 
and useful book. 



A re-teiiina of ^^ selecting Juan Ponce de Leon as 
the romance of the Subject of One of his volumes in 
Concede Leon, ^j^g series of "Heroes of American 
History " (Harper), Mr. Frederick A. Ober assumed 
the task of writing a biography with very slender 
materials at command, and this has necessitated the 
resort to padding, though the book be still a small 
one. The author's familiarity with the West Indies 
has come to his assistance, and he has eked out the 
few well-known incidents of Juan Ponce's career by 
a more detailed account of that sturdy conquistador's 
exploitation of the Island of Porto Rico. He further- 
more finds occasion to correct some widespread but 
erroneous popular impressions regarding Juan Ponce 
de Leon. He was not an old man to whom the 
Fountain of Perpetual Youth was an especial desid- 
eratum when he set out in search of the Island of 
Bimini, being then but fifty-three years of age ; nor 
was the Fountain of Youth the chief object of his 
search. Like all the adventurers of his time, he was 
seeking gold, and slaves to work the mines. Mr. 
Ober clearly shows, also, that the year which saw 
Juan Ponce on the shores of Florida was not 1512, 
as is usually stated, but the one following. The book 
is an entertaining one, and a contribution, in its way, 
to historical literature. 

Napoleon's Those who have followed the con- 

dream of an . . ^ L -KT ^ f ■% 

invasion of troversy about Napoleon s plan to 
England. invade England, in 1804 or 1805, 
will pick up Mr. Fernand Nicolay's "Napoleon at 
the Boulogne Camp" (Lane) with the expectation 
of finding a solution of the problems involved. They 
will discover, instead, the results of the zealous but 
rambling researches of a local antiquary, whose 
original interest in the matter sprang from the family 
ownership of the exact spot on the Plateau d'Ordre 
where stood the pavilions of Napoleon and of his 
admiral, Bruix. Mr. Nicolay tells diverting tales 
of almost every phase of the camp life at Boulogne. 
He describes the camp in detail, the flotilla, the 
training of the soldiers, and the incidents that 
enlivened the long months of waiting, including even 
the performances of the Paris Vaudeville company 
and the choral songs of the soldiers. In the final 
chapter he attempts to review the evidence in regard 
to the project for crossing the Channel, as late as 
August, 1805. For a task of this sort the author 
seems unfitted, for he gives more credence to the 
random and inexact recollections of Constant than 
to the results of the researches of Desbribre, based 
upon official papers preserved in the Archives of 
War and Marine. • 

To write a life of Queen Victoria that 
VumTuTeent'' ^^^^ll not take the form of a glowing 

eulogy seems to be an impossible, as 
it may also be an undesirable, achievement. Mr. 
Frank Hird, in his " Victoria the Woman " 
(Appleton), has certainly not produced a coldly 
impartial or unsympathetic biography. He emphat- 
ically calls her "the greatest of the English queens " 
and, what is more, "the simplest, the kindest, the

purest, the most single-minded of women." The 
purpose of the book, as he explains in the preface, 
is "to place before my readers in America, where 
the Queen was reverenced and so deeply admired, 
some impression of the influences that affected her 
early environment, some suggestion of the circum- 
stances that affected her later years. I have 
endeavored to show the Queen as a daughter, a 
wife, a woman, a mother, a friend, and a sovereign, 
and wherever it has been possible I have made use 
of the Queen's own words, as it is in her letters and 
her diaries that her character, in all its charm of 
simplicity and naturalness, its warm affection, its 
impartiality of opinion, its instinctive understanding, 
its ever-ready sympathy, and true womanliness, 
fully reveals itself. Some of the letters have never 
before been published." In four hundred clearly 
printed pages, with a sufficiency of good illustrations, 
the growth of the Queen's character is traced, with 
a considerable introduction of current history and 
politics. Nothing very new or very original was to 
be expected in such a study of so well-known a per- 
sonage ; but a serviceable and readable book has 
been produced, and for those who do not and cannot 
own the voluminous and expensive " Letters " this 
volume, with its copious extracts from those letters 
and from the diaries, should serve as a welcome 
substitute. 



Notes. 



« Art in Needlework," being a book about embroidery 
by Mr. Lewis F. Day and Miss Mary Buckle, is sent 
us in its third enlarged edition by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

A second edition, revised and augmented, of Mr. J. E. 
Spingarn's "A History of Literary Criticism in the 
Renaissance " is now published by the Messrs. Macmillan 
at the Columbia University Press. 

That standard biography, the " Life and Letters of 
Robert Browning," by Mrs. Sutherland Orr, revised and 
in part re-written by Mr. Frederic G. Kenyon, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Early in June The Century Co. will publish a new 
novel by a new author, " The Post-Girl " by Edward C. 
Booth. It is a romance of a musician and a charming 
girl, with a bit of mystery about her family, set in .the 
Yorkshire country. 

Mr. Bliss Perry's "Walt Whitman: His Life and 
Work," which is about the sanest and most judicious 
life of the poet thus far produced, has been revised by 
the author in several important particulars, and is now 
republished by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" The Shakespeare Apocrypha," a collection of four- 
teen plays which have been ascribed to Shakespeare, 
will be published this month by the Oxford University 
Press. The volume has been edited, with introduction, 
notes, and bibliography, by Mr. C. F. Tucker Brooke. 

Mr. John Lane publishes a volume devoted to the life 
and works of Claude-Achille Debussy in the series of 
" Living Masters of Music." It is the work of Mrs. 
Franz Liebich, and has a fine portrait, two other plates, 
and numerous examples of the composer's work in musi- 
cal notation. 



"French Song and Verse for Children," edited by 
Miss Helen Terry, and published by the Messrs. Long- 
mans, is a little book that may be recommended for both 
school and home use. The contents range all the way 
from nursery jingles to bits of such classical poets as 
Malherbe, La Fontaine, and Hugo. 

A new edition of " An Art Guide to Painting in Italy," 
being Jacob Burckhardt's "Cicerone," translated by Mrs. 
A. H. Clough, is published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. Half a centiu-y of use has not staled this work, 
which is still one of the most compact and trustworthy 
guides available for the purposes of the student of art. 

The De Vinne Press annoimces that it has taken over 
the entire business and plant of the firm of Theo. L. 
De Vinne & Co., the well-known printing firm of New 
York. This change will in no wise affect the poUcy of 
the house. The members of the old firm and the heads 
of departments are to continue with the new company. 

Three Spanish texts just pubUshed by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. are as follows : " Spanish Composition," 
by Mr. Alfred Remy; "El Trovador" (the original of 
VA-di's opera) by Antonio Garcia Gutierrez, edited by 
Dr. H. H. Vaughan; and "Lo Positive," by Tamayo y 
Baus, edited by Messrs. PhiUp Harry and Alfonso de 
Salvio. 

"Three Tragedies of Seneca " (the « Hercules Furens," 
" Troades," and " Medea ") are edited, with an elaborate 
introduction and many notes, by Professor H. M. 
Kingery, and published in a neat volume by The Mac- 
millan Co. From Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. we have 
" An Elementary Latin Course," by Professor Franklin 
Hazen Potter. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers pubhsh a new edition of 
Dr. W. E. Griffis's condensation of Motley's « History of 
the Dutch Republic," to which is appended Dr. Griffis's 
own history of the Dutch nation from the point where 
Motley left o£P to the present time. The two sections 
of the work are necessarily upon different scales, but a 
more useful single-volume treatment of Dutch history 
is hardly to be found. 

After nearly a year in temporary quarters, The 
Macmillan Company has just returned to its enlarged 
and remodeled building at 64-66 Fifth Avenue, New 
York. The additions have more than doubled the floor 
space of the old building, and the company now occupies 
what is said to be the largest and most thoroughly 
equipped building in America devoted exclusively to a 
general book pubhshing business. 

Miss Kate Sanborn's imique and interesting book on 
" Old-Time Wall Papers," originally published some two 
years ago by The Literary Collector Press of New York 
(and reviewed in The Dial for July 16, 1906), is now 
reissued with the imprint of Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 
As the only book on the subject of the old-fashioned pic- 
torial wall-papers, many of which are reproduced in the 
original colors, it will be highly valued by those interested 
in Colonial furnishings. 

The " Who 's Who ? " idea is spreading into special 
channels, as is just now evidenced by the publication of 
" Who Is Who in Insurance," a year-book of biographies 
and miscellaneous matter, issued by the Singer Co., New 
York. The biographies fill about half of the stout vol- 
ume, number nearly twenty-six hundred, and represent 
over a score of countries, for the work is international 
in its scope. It seems to be put forth partly as a har- 
binger of an " International Insm-ance Encyclopedia," to 
fill six volumes, and to be issued by the same firm.

Messrs. Duffield & Co., having purchased the publi- 
cation rights of all Mrs. Elinor Glyn's writings so far 
issued in America, have lost no time in bringing out new 
editions of the three novels that came between " The 
Visits of Elizabeth "and " Three Weeks," and of "The 
Damsel and the Sage," a collection of epigrams con- 
nected by a slender thread of narrative. The titles of 
the novels are " Beyond the Rocks," " The Reflections 
of Ambrosine," and "The Vicissitudes of Evangeline." 
The same publishers announce a new novel by Mrs. 
Glyn, — " Elizabeth Visits America," — to be ready in 
the Fall. 

The fifteenth annual edition of "The Corporation 
Manual " is now at hand, and may be obtained from 
Messrs. Callaghan & Co., Chicago. It is a volume of 
nearly two thousand pages, being about fifty per cent 
larger than the preceding issue. The statutory provisions 
of each State are given in condensed and conveniently 
classified form, besides the full text of the statutes, 
supplemented by explanatory notes and cases. The 
anti-trust laws of all the States are also given in full. 
The series of corporate forms, which fills an important 
section of the work, provides models for every kind of 
corporate transaction. The work is, of course, indispen- 
sable to lawyers, and will be found useful for reference 
by all persons who are in any way connected with cor- 
porations, either as officers or stockholders.

By WILLIAM JASPER NICOLLS 

You need only to read this book to be transported 
to the rugged shores of Casco Bay, to meet the stal- 
wart fishermen of Orr's Island, to see the jaunty 
Phyllis fresh from her New York Club anchorage 
gliding into this quiet harbor. To know Brunhilda 
is to recognize a new character in fiction. Niece of 
a charm, a freshness that at once becomes the dominant 
love story breathlessly only to sigh at the end for more

Price $3.00 net. By Mail, $3.20. 

Invaluable to every golfer,

A work that delves into the

once becomes a handbook of 
inestimable value. 



Concerning 
Laf cadio Heam 

By GEORGE M. GOULD, M.D. 
Price $1.50 net. By Mail, $1.65. 

Few men in America were 
privileged to know Lafcadio 
Hearn so intimately as Dr. 
Gould. No work so clearly 
portrays the famous Greek's 
character, his personality, as 
this volume. It constitutes 
virtually a personal introduc- 
tion to the man himself. 

Trees in Nature, 
Myth, and Art 

By J. ERNEST PHYTHIAN 

Price $1.50 net. By Mail, $1.60. 

The most original nature 
book of the year. It enters 
into the soul of the forest. It 
tells the story of the tree as it 
would tell the story of a man. 
It traces the life, the history, 
the utility of the tree — when 
it was worshipped, its place 
in Architecture, Painting, 
and Sculpture. 



DANTON 

and the French 
Revolution 

By the Hon. 
CHARLES F. WARWICK 

Price $2.50 net. By Mail, $2.65. 

Marie Antoinette, Marat, 
Camille Desmoulins, Char- 
lotte Corday — the men and 
women who stood in the 
glare of the Reign of Terror, 
live and breathe in these 
pages. Mr. Warwick has 
sensed a degree of interest 
which French historians 
themselves have failed to de- 
velop in the story of the Re- 
volution. We see Paris in the 
grim days of dying Royalty, 
we hear the fall of the guil- 
lotine, we seem to fight side 
by side through the barri- 
caded streets with the very 
men who directed France's 
struggle for freedom.

A SECOND EDITION IS NOW READY OF 

Our Country Home 

The Chronicle of the Planning, Building, and Arranging of a 
Beautiful Country Place 

By FRANCES KINSLEY HUTCHINSON 

SELDOM has a book had the 
unanimous praise accorded to 
" Our Country Home." On every 
side it has awakened enthusiasm of 
a purely spontaneous kind, for it 
possesses that intimate personal ap- 
peal which makes its every reader 
feel that it has been written for 
him. The harmonious color- 
schemes, the generous fireplaces, 
the hospitable atmosphere, the 
intimate friendships with the birds, 
the wild flowers, and all the creep- 
ing, growing things — all these are 
described in the most sympathetic and glowing manner. In the language 
of the New York Sun^ it is " the most amazing and delightful nature 
book in lo! these many moons." 

From the CHICAGO TRIBUNE 

It has about it a certain noble simplicity as the result of the owner's devotion to what is 
essential for serene retirement, and sociability for wood and field. The trees and the creatures 
furred and feathered, the gardens and the summer flowers and winter berries, the night and 
the day, the sun and the rain, these have made her canticle, which she offers in the fully 
justified belief that no person of sound heart and judicious understanding can fail to be inter- 
ested in the unaffected and friendly story of how a home was made in the woods. 

From the CHICAGO EVENING POST 

Uniting a delight in the doing, and the gift of writing with spontaneity and sincerity in a love 
for rural life, the author has filled a book with happy, fluent description, bravely mingled with 
practical suggestion and a clear understanding of the plans that transformed the wilderness 
into a garden. 

With many illustrations from photographs. At all bookstores. $2.00 net.

Entertaining Vacation Fiction 

PRISONERS OF CHANCE By randall parrish 

"The story lacks none of the romantic interest of Mr. Parrish's previous novels, and, with its fine 
colored illustrations by the Kinneys, should be not far from the leading novel of the season." 
Topeka Journal. Colored illustrations by The Kinneys. $1.50. 

THE SILVER BLADE By charles e. walk 

" The foundations of the story are well laid and its construction work is clever and true. The 
plot is ingeniously developed, and many of the situations are handled in masterly style, direct in 
simplicity and tender in pathos." — Charleston (S. C.) Neivs and Courier. 

Colored illustrations by A. B. Wenzell. $1.50. 

INTO THE PRIMITIVE By robert ames bennet 

" The story is as unhackneyed in treatment as it is unusual in conception. The author has an 
incisive, almost staccato crispness and directness in style, entirely in accord with the tale he tells." 
— "Brooklyn Times. Colored illustrations by A. T. True. $1.50. 

HER LADYSHIP By katherine tynan 

" As a study of conditions on the large, well-managed estates, the book has much weight ; but 
after all, it is the love of her Ladyship for a man whose nobility is that of character rather than of 
birth that gives the greatest charm to the story." — Bookseller, Nenusdealer, and Stationer . $1.25 

BETH NORVELL By randall parrish 

"It's exciting, all right. The whole story keeps you forgetting to draw every third or fourth 
breath. You just can't lay the book down after things are once fairly oiled up and going. Mr. 
Parrish is gifted with the precious knack of swift and thrilling narrative." — E. L. Shuman in the 
Chicago Record-Herald.^ Colored illustrations by N. C. Wyeth. $1.50. 

THE CRIMSON CONQUEST By charles b. Hudson 

" Most remarkable is it, and doubly welcome, when the highest standard is approached by the first 
volume of one to fame unknown. To this dignity of precedence rises Charles B. Hudson's ' The 
Crimson Conquest.' In intensity of interest he surpasses a famous predecessor in his field, Prescott, 
princeof chroniclers." — Kansas City Star. Colored illustrations by J. C. Leyendecker. $1.50.

narration exceedingly interesting." — Chicago Inter Ocean. Net $1.25 

LANGFORD OF THE THREE BARS By kate and virgil d. boyles 

" There are some stories which, for no definable reason, seem touched with the spirit of youth and 
vitality. Such a tale is ' Langford of the Three Bars,' a vigorous, well-shaped story of ' cattle- 
rustling' and conflict on the wide, lawless plains of South Dakota. It is a stirring story, full of 
strength and color, quick with abundant dramatic action, cheered by a happy ending." — Chicago

A CAPTIVATING ROMANCE

Princess 

Dehra 

By 

JOHN REED SCOTT 

TN his new novel Mr. Scott re- 
■*■ turns to Valeria, the scene of 
his first success, " The Colonel of 
the Red Huzzars," and gives us 
a story which, while independent 
and standing absolutely alone, is 
yet, in effect, a sequel. 

The story has the same light 
touch, swift action, quick art and 
repartee, sharp and unexpected cli- 
maxes, intrigue, sword-play, and 
danger, that have stood out so 
noticeably in the author's two 
former romances, the " Colonel " 
and "Beatrix of Clare," but it 
also has the surer hand of the 
maturer writer, and the nicer ap- 
preciation of detail and values, 
and will, no doubt, be one of the 
most widely read and discussed 
novels of the summer.

SWEET AND WHOLESOME 



Marcia 
Schuyler 

By 

GRACE LIVINGSTON 
HILL LUTZ 

'T^HE story of Marcia Schuyler 
has a unique plot, fragrant of 
lavender and rosemary. 

It is a romance of simple life, yet 
thrilling with heart experiences, 
touched with humor, shadowed 
by tragedy — but through it all 
Marcia wins her sweet way in 
spite of maiden-aunts and jealous 
rivals. The novel is set in the 
time of 1830, and the story of the 
introduction of the steam railway 
in New York forms an interesting, 
as well as important, part of the 
plot. 

" A pleasant story, delightfully 
told, with a refreshing ring of 
candor and sincerity throughout 
its pages, a distinctive local at- 
mosphere, broad, clear-cut char- 
acterization, and a suave and 
engaging literary method and 
manner. ' ' — Philadelphia North

A MODERN NOVEL 



The Master 
Influence 

By 

THOMAS McKEAN 

THE "master influence" — 
love, still love that makes the 
world go round — is in evidence 
almost from the outset of the nar- 
rative, although not until the final 
page is the account of the fickle 
god closed and fairly balanced. 
The novelist sketches in succes- 
sion numerous variant phases of 
the grand passion — lawless love, 
that ends in death ; the bitterness 
of vain longing ; reckless impulse 
with its tragical culmination — 
these and kindred aspects of the 
main theme are brought into 
strong relief as the plot of the story 
is disclosed and developed. 

Helen Mainwaring, the heroine, 
is an interesting as well as an at- 
tractive figure. A young woman 
of birth, breeding and wealth, it is 
her belief that she can live without 
love. Her interest is in a hospital. 
Many men tell her of their devo- 
tion, but she remains obdurate 
until the book ncars its end. Then 
she succumbs to "the master in- 
fluence."

AN UNUSUAL ROMANCE 



The 
Blue Lagoon 

By 

H. DEVERE STAC- 
POOLE 

A N enchanting romance, reviv- 
•^*- ing memories of " Paul and 
Virginia," concerned with two 
Boston children, a boy and a girl, 
cast away upon a desert island in 
mid-ocean, with only an old Irish 
sailor, Paddy Button, as compan- 
ion. Paddy soon dies and leaves 
them to grow to manhood and 
womanhood alone, and learn for 
themselves the meaning of love 
and the great truths of life. To 
quote from the author: " Nature 
had indeed opened her doors to 
these children. One might have 
fancied her in an experimental 
mood, saying : ' Let me put these 
buds of civilization back into my 
nursery and see what they will 
become — ^how they will blossom, 
and what will be the end of it 
all.' " "The Blue Lagoon " is 
one of the most unusual tales of a 
generation, as a prominent review 
says: "^ story nvhich is unlike 
any other story that ever nuas 
^written . ' '

MYSTERY THAT MYSTIFIES 



In the Dead 
of Night 

By 

JOHN T. McINTYRE 

A LIVE, startling story that 
possesses sufficient move- 
ment and thrilling incident to fit 
out ten ordinary stories of mystery 
and adventure. 

The hero is, as it were, kid- 
napped in the first chapter, placed 
in another man's shoes, and forced 
to act in the dark. He is set in the 
midst of piled-up mysteries, beset 
on every hand, and forced by pride, 
later by love, to unravel the tan- 
gled web, the threads of which fate 
has placed in his hands. 

The entire action of the story 
takes place in the silent watches 
when the heart of a great city 
beats faintly.

sorbing interest." — Philadelphia

Psychical Research and the Resurrection 

By JAMES H. HYSLOP, Ph.D., LL.D. 

Former Professor of Logic and Ethics at Columbia University , Vice-President of the Fnplish Society 
for Psychical Research, Secretary of the Am.erican Society for Psychical Research. A uthor of" Bor- 
derland of Psychical Research," "Enigmas of Psychical Research," " Science and a Future Life." 

This volume may be considered as a sequel to Professor Hyslop's "Science and a Future Life," for it records the 
more important work that has been accomplished since the death of Dr. Richard Hodgson, the late leader of psychical 
research in America. 

Beginning with a chapter or two devoted to the importance of conducting psychical investigation as a science, 
and showing its relation to psychology and the better understanding of consciousness. Professor Hyslop goes on to show 
how vital to the ethical progress of the human race it is that psychical research answer materialistic science with facts 
pointing directly to the survival of consciousness apart from brain functioning. 

Taking up the misunderstandings of the work held by the public, the book proceeds to devote chapters to Coinci- 
dences ; Visions of the Dying ; the Smead Case, a new and important case of trance phenomena ; experiments through Mrs. 
Piper, Mrs. Smead, and others, involving the attempts to prove identity by a personality claiming to be Dr. Hodgson 
sincedeath ; The Nature of Life After Death, as reported by communicators through the Piper case ; Telepathy ; Subliminal 
Activities ; and finally a chapter entitled, " Psychical Research and the Resurrection," in which Professor Hyslop empha- 
sizes the thousands of recorded cases of apparitions coincidental with death collected by the Society for Psychical Research 
which go to confirm the historical Resurrection, and proceeds to show the vital importance to humanity that Science 
leave no stone unturned to strengthen the Christian faith. 12mo. Cloth, $1.60 net ; by mail $1.62. 

The Psychology of Advertising 

By WALTER DILL SCOTT 

Professor of Psychology and Director of the Psychological Laboratory, 
Northwestern University. Author of " The Theory of Advertising," etc. 
During the past decade the realization has grown up that since advertising seeks to influence the human mind, 
and phychology is the study of the human mind, therefore, the more the business man knows about psychology the 
better he will know how to advertise. 

Professor Scott's book is the common meeting ground of the psychologist and the advertiser. The prevailing note 
of the book is its usefulness, for it is based on practical laboratory tests of the psychological effects of advertisements. 
Important principles are laid down and the application explained clearly and convincingly. 

Advertisers who say that the way to learn to advertise is — to advertise, will find here just the book they need ; 
it is the boiled-down result of genuine experience interpreted accurately.

PEDESTRIANISM AND POETRY. 



Ambulator nascitur^ nonjit. That the poet 
is born and not made, no one would dispute ; ' 
that the walker, like the poet, is born and not 
made, might not be so generally admitted, but 
was the belief of at least one authority on walk- 
ing, Thoreau. A gift for poetry and a gift for 
walking are perhaps not found so often together 
as separate ; yet there are many instances of 
their happy union in one and the same person. 
Bards and minstrels we think of as making 
their way on foot from place to place, and even 
from country to country. Homer must have 
been a tremendous walker — so little stationary 
that no fewer than seven cities claimed him as 
son. Goldsmith, strolling over Europe and 
making music as he went, is a familiar example. 
Wordsworth composed his poems as he walked, 
elaborating long passages of verse before putting 
pen to paper. 

Walking for the love of walking, and for the 
enjoyment of nature by the way, seems to be a 
comparatively modern form of recreation . When 
Wordsworth, in his third long vacation at 
Cambridge, in the summer of 1790, took staff 
in hand and, with a friend, made the tour of 
Switzerland on foot, he spoke of this pedestrian 
enterprise as an " unprecedented course," and 
as indicative of "a hardy slight of college 
studies and their set rewards." One of the 
poet's biographers inclines to think that Words- 
worth and his companion were indeed the first 
students to indulge in this now so common 
relaxation from academic toil. 

Until about a century ago it seems rarely to 
have occurred to anyone that mountains and 
woods and rocky coasts are objects to be ad- 
mired, and to be visited even at much cost of 
bodily ease and comfort. One of the characters 
in " Sir Charles Grandison " feels nothing but 
horror for the Alpine scenery of Savoy, as 
viewed from the Mont Cenis pass. He contrasts 
the region, " equally noted for its poverty and 
rocky mountains," with the smiling fields of 
France, and declares that his spirits " were great 
sufferers by the change." But for Sir Charles's 
kindness and attention to his comfort, he feels 
that he never coidd have faced the terrible pass- 
age to Italy. Bishop Berkeley, a man of taste 
and sensibility, passing over this same mountain 



334 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



road to Italy in 1714, was " put out of humour 
by the most horrible precipices," and advised a 
friend to choose the comparatively safe and 
pleasant route by sea. Dr. Johnson (to quote 
one more eighteenth-century authority) was so 
little inspired by the scenery of the Scotch 
highlands that he could declare in aU serious- 
ness : " It will readily occur that this imiformity 
' of barrenness can afford very little amusement 
to the traveller ; that it is easy to sit at home 
and conceive rocks, heaths, and waterfalls, and 
that these journeys are useless labours, which 
neither impregnate the imagination nor inform 
the understanding." Perhaps if Johnson had 
been a walker, instead of being obliged to sub- 
mit his unwieldly bulk to the jolts and jars of 
vehicular transport, he might have brought 
home a kinder remembrance of that " uniformity 
of barrenness." As it was, he could just as well, 
so far as his susceptibility to scenic charm was 
concerned, have sat at his ease in the parlor of 
the " Mitre " and conceived rocks, heaths, and 
waterfalls, in any number and variety. For him, 
certainly, there was no pleasure in the pathless 
woods, no rapture on the lonely shore. 

It is refreshing to turn from the incorrigibly 
urban and sedentary Johnson to that pedestrian 
enthusiast and enamoured mountain-climber, 
Leslie Stephen — who, curiously enough, was 
one of Johnson's warmest admirers. Stephen's 
ascription of a moral quality to the innate love 
of walking is well known : a passion for pedes- 
trianism could not, to his thinking, consist with 
vicious habits. And however matter-of-fact 
and drily prosaic he may have chosen to imagine 
himself in his editorial chair or in the bookish 
seclusion of his study, there was something in 
the charm of natural scenery to make him break 
forth in song, at least in his earlier life. In 
that delightful and too-little-read early book of 
his, entitled " The Playground of Europe," are 
to be found no fewer than thirty-eight quota- 
tions or adaptations from the poets, an average 
of one to every nine pages, which, for a writer 
by no means sentimental or romantic, is doing 
pretty well. He gives the reader the feeling of 
walking with him up steep mountain paths, 
across glaciers, over jagged rocks, along fearfid 
precipices, and down snowy slopes ; and with him 
the reader finds himself poetically inspired — 
to the point of more or less apt quotation, at any 
rate. For poetic charm, just relieved (so to 
speak) by the subtlest suggestion of dry humor, 
what could be better than Stephen's description 
of a sunset that he viewed from Mont Blanc, 
after an all-day climb from Chamouni for the 



purpose of witnessing, if weather conditions 
should be favorable, a spectacle of extraordinary 
grandeur that not more than half a dozen human 
beings had seen before him ? Let us transcribe 
a few sentences. 

" Peak by peak the high snowfields caught the rosy 
glow and shone like sigfnal-fires across the dim breadths 
of delicate twilight. Like Xerxes we looked over the 
countless host sinking to rest, but with the rather difPer- 
ent reflection, that a hundred years hence they would 
probably be doing much the same thing, whilst we 
should long have ceased to take any interest in the 
performance. . . . We were between the day and the 
night. The western heavens were of the most brilliant 
blue with spaces of transparent green, whilst a few 
scattering cloudlets glowed as if with internal fire. To 
the east the night rushed up furiously, and it was diffi- 
cult to imagine that the dark purple sky was really 
cloudless and not blackened by the rising of some por- 
tentous storm. That it was, in fact, cloudless, appeared 
from the unbroken disc of the full moon, which, if I may 
venture to say so, had a kind of silly expression, as 
though it were a bad imitation of the sun, totally unable 
to keep the darkness in order. 

" ' With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the sky, 
How silently and with how wan a face ! ' " 

Stephen walked with senses alert for every 
impression from without, but at the same time 
with no vacancy of mind within. " You must 
walk like a camel," says Thoreau, " which is 
said to be the only beast which ruminates when 
walking." And yet the rumination must not 
be too engrossing. " I am alarmed," confesses 
the same nature-lover and sturdy pedestrian, 
" when it happens that I have walked a mile 
into the woods bodily, without getting there in 
spirit." Rather should one have the soul tuned 
in harmony with that of the jocund traveller who 
rises before the mind's eye in the quaint old 

" When he came to a grene wode. 
In a merry momynge, 
There he herde the notes small 
Of byrdes merry syngynge." 

What coidd better picture the escape from the 
asphyxia of towns and streets, and from the 
mustiness of libraries and studies ? 

Thoreau, who held that the noble art of 
walking comes only by the grace of God, said 
that he had met with but two persons who 
imderstood this art, who had a genius, so to 
speak, for sauntering ; and he took pleasure in 
going back to the derivation of " saunter " (from 
sainte terre)^ a wood whose history is written 
on its face. He liked to think of every real 
walk as a sort of crusade. His crusades, how- 
ever, were preferably to the West, not toward 
the East — probably because Boston and other 
cities of men lay not far distant in the latter 
direction, and the hermit of Walden sought the 
uninhabited wilds. " My spirits infallibly rise

in proportion to the outward dreariness," he 
tells us ; and further, with the true walker's 
impulse toward poetry : " I do not know of 
any poetry to quote which adequately expresses 
this yearning for the Wild. Approached from 
this side, the best poetry is tame. I do not 
know where to find in any literature, ancient 
or modern, any account which contents me of 
that Nature with which even I am acquainted. 
You will perceive that I demand something 
which no Augustan nor Elizabethan age, which 
no culture^ in short, can give. Mythology 
comes nearer to it than anything." 

The swift bicycle did much to discredit plod- 
ding pedestrianism, and the automobile has, 
with the wealthy and fashionable, wrought still 
further mischief ; but inasmuch as far fewer can 
afford to own motor-cars than bicycles, and as 
the speedier vehicle has well-nigh put its prede- 
cessor out of use, perhaps walking may yet regain 
something of its former vogue, at least with the 
multitude who are not blessed (or cursed) with 
a motor-car income. To be sure, there is the 
convenient and inexpensive "trolley" to tempt 
one from the pedestrian's path of rectitude ; but 
it will be long before it conquers (if it ever does 
conquer) our more rural districts and relegates 
pedestrianism to the limbo of the lost arts. 

Let us quote a contemporary poet's words on 
walking as a beautiful and dignified bodily exer- 
cise. "• An idea that shall help us to walk well," 
says Mr. Bliss Carman, " is to think of the walk 
as a moderated run rather than to think of tbe 
run as a modification of the walk. Fancy the 
Flying Mercury changing feet, and you have an 
ideal run. Fancy that run slackened in speed, 
and you have a godlike walk." It was said of 
Adelaide Neilson, as the same writer reminds 
us, that " to see her walk was like listening to 
exquisite music, so well rhymed and eloquent 
was her motion." In Salvini's walk, too, espe- 
cially in the character of Othello, there was 
majesty of motion ; and though (or because) he 
played the part in bare feet, his tread was 
dignified. These and other instances tending 
to prove that the poetry of motion is by no 
means confined to dancing are cited by Mr. 
Carman, who is himself an accomplished pedes- 
trian as well as a poet. 

A friend and classmate of the writer's offers 
another living example of a happy marriage of 
poetry and pedestrianism. He loves the woods 
and mountains and lakes, and cannot take a 
hundred steps toward them without experienc- 
ing a strong impulse to break into verse, prefer- 
ably from Byron or Scott. Innumerable other 



scraps and tags of appropriate rhyme, haunting 
lines that may have lain unsuspected in his 
memory for twenty years or more, are called to 
mind by the ever-changing scene. It is a delight 
to walk with him, as with one who, in his own 
genial way, proves how true it is that a merry 
(and a poetry-loving) heart goes all the day, 
whereas your sad and prosaic one tires in a 
mile. 

Essays in Every-day Philosophy.* 



The much current talk about the simple life 
and a return to nature is, of course, a sure sign 
of increasing complexity and artificiality in our 
way of living. What we really are we are 
least inclined to talk about. Nevertheless, if 
we will persist in not living the simple life, it 
may be better than nothing to discuss it and 
read books in praise of it, even though thereby 
the risk is run lest we " divorce the Feeling 
from her mate the Deed." 

A shrewdly observant and refreshingly inde- 
pendent woman of rural Indiana has of late 
years been expressing her views on subjects of 
human interest to all readers, in " The Indian- 
apolis News," and, more recently, in " The 
Ladies' Home Journal." From the pages of 
the latter periodical there are now collected 
into a smaU volume, prefaced by Mr. Edward 
Bok, a number of these informal but well- 
written disquisitions on topics congenial espe- 
cially to women — unless the women are too 
pronouncedly of the " new " sort. These brief 
and sensible talks, entitled collectively " The 
Ideas of a Plain Country Woman," are credited 
to " The Country Contributor," beneath whose 
modestly assumed anonymity we will not seek 
to penetrate. That she is possessed of a keen 
sense of humor is made delightfully evident 
again and again, but nowhere more conclusively 
than in her regretful admission that women are

sadly lacking in this sense. " I wish," she 
declares, "that when Adam gave up that rib 
he had also parted with some of the funny-bone, 
so that his help-meet might be able to see the 
joke oftener." The writer is a wife and mother, 
and she praises and ennobles the homely joys 
of domestic life. Almost she persuades one that 
the lot of even a prairie farmer's wife is richly 
blessed and beyond aU others desirable. 

To Miss Zephine Humphrey, life with aU its 
joys and sorrows, and even its petty anxieties 
and vexations, is immensely interesting and 
decidedly worth living. Such at least is the 
impression one gets of her in reading " Over 
Against Green Peak," wherein she describes, 
with freshness and gusto, her selection and pur- 
chase of an old house in rural New England, and 
her moving into and living in it with " Aimt 
Susan" and " Jane," and, after a little, " Brid- 
get." Experiments with abandoned farms have 
already furnished forth literature in abundance, 
but that detracts nothing from the merits of Miss 
Humphrey's venture in the same field. Her 
story is told out of her own experience, one can- 
not but believe ; and if here and there, for the 
sake of effect, she over-accentuates a note or 
strains her reader's credulity — as in her account 
of the butcher's carts that drove madly by her 
door in a feverish haste to escape her patronage 
— that must be excused as literary license. But 
it makes one thirsty to think of all the dinners 
of dried beef those three women had to eat in 
consequence of the very un- Yankeelike, uncom- 
mercial conduct of those meat-peddlers. Of all 
the experiences related in the book, one of the 
most enjoyable, to a book-reviewer at any rate, 
is the account of the putting in order of the 
library. Here is what is said of the little corner 
bookcase that held the collection of essays : 

"All there, my hearties? Then all is well. The 
assortment here is the least creditable, from a book col- 
lector's point of view, of any the house contains. Odd, 
ragged volumes, mismated, despoiled, vagabonds of the 
shelf, merry survivors of statelier times when the gar- 
ments were at least stiff and new which now hang about 
them so recklessly, they look out into the room with a 
certain disreputable good-cheer which is quite irresist- 
ible. Their demoralization is completed by the fact 
that there is never a time when some two or three of 
them are not leaning confidingly across space to take 
advantage of the temporary absence of a next neighbor 
and have a chat with a next neighbor but one." 

Although we have selected the only bookish 
chapter in the volume for purposes of quotation, 
it must not be supposed that the book as a whole 
is not as fresh and exhilarating, tp nature-lovers, 
as the mountain air and mountain scenery that 
have largely inspired it. 



Like Miss Humphrey, Miss Helen M. Wins- 
low has a penchant for old run-to-seed farms, a 
humorous way of describing country scenes and 
events, and a fresh unconventional manner of 
looking at life's problems and perplexities. In 
her " Spinster Farm " we are made acquainted 
with some original though not too clearly drawn 
characters, — the Spinster, Janet Fleming by 
name, who purchases the farm and engages in 
chicken-raising ; her lively young niece Peggy ; 
the Professor, who pays persistent court to the 
Spinster ; young Robert Graves, who does the 
same to Peggy ; and the humbler characters 
playing their useful parts in kitchen and barn. 
Homely reality is interspersed with romance ; 
but far be it from the reviewer to reveal the 
plot and spoil the story for others. Rather let 
it suffice here to give a specimen or two of the 
Spinster's philosophy of life. Listen to her 
praises of rural as contrasted with urban 
existence. 

" When I go into the city, to-day, I see everywhere 
the man with the muck-rake, his eyes ever on the 
ground, insensible to the world of beauty around him. 
People hurry on with eager, strained faces, wildly pur- 
suing the unattainable; or, if it proves to be attainable, 
to what end ? The best countenances have a weary, 
unrested look ; the worst are worse than I ever realized 
before. So much of the real essence of life is lost to 
these hurried and breathless ones. I thank God for the 
privilege of living where I may look up to the stars and 
listen with quiet heart for the music of the spheres. 
After a day of noise, of struggling with pushing, 
jostling crowds in the city, the old low-ceilinged living- 
room, with its cheerful wood fire in the ancient fire- 
place, its comfortable old chairs, its books and its home 
atmosphere, seems to me the most refreshing spot on 
earth." 

And who would not wish to be an old maid 
after reading the following ? 

"Things are altogether changed from the previous 
generation. To-day the old maid does not wear herself out 
working for her brother's family or taking care of her 
sister's children. If she has no money she teaches, or 
lectures, or writes books or poems, or she does anything 
but hang on the coat-skirts of somebody's husband, and 
she feels self-respecting and self-dependent in conse- 
quence. She is as bright and happy as any young girl, 
and even better to those who have outgrown bread and 
butter. She has sense as well as freshness, conversa^ 
tional power and wit as well as downright ability and 
good looks. She has live poets and notables and phil- 
osophers in her train. She wears well-fittmg gowns. 
. . . She doesn't care whether she is married or not; 
at least, one would never know if she does." 

The numerous illustrations from photographs, 
showing among other things the farm-house or 
" mansion " from two points of view, and also 
the spinster herself , help to make the story very 
real ; and if more were needed, we have the 
publishers' word for it that " most of the inci-

dents and all of the characters are real, as well 
as the farm and farmhouse, unchanged since 
Colonial days." 

What is one man's paradox is another man's 
platitude. So says Bagshot, and the saying is 
likely to prove its truth in the different impres- 
sion his utterances (as recorded in "The Com- 
ments of Bagshot ") will make on different 
readers. But no one, unless hopelessly didl and 
unimpressionable, can fail to find something re- 
freshingly original in many of Bagshot's opinions 
and judgments of men and things. Bagshot, let 
it be imderstood, owes his being to Mr. J. A. 
Spender, whose name will sound not unfamiliar 
to those acquainted with the novels of Mrs. J. K. 
Spender, his mother. Mr. Spender chooses to 
style himself " editor " of the Bagshottian par- 
adoxes and platitudes, and gravely informs us 
that poor Bagshot is now no more ; but of 
course we all know what that kind of preface to 
this kind of book means in these days, and of 
course the writer himself knows that we know. 
Mr. Spender's little volume is, in one respect 
at least, an improvement on its Bensonian arche- 
type : its chapters are of sententious brevity, 
and the book is ended long before the reader be- 
comes conscious of that fatigue which unbroken 
monologue, even from the brightest of essayists, 
tends to induce unless taken by snatches and read 
non-consecutively. These miscellaneous and 
widely-ranging comments are often so epigram- 
matically put as to make them very quotable. 
Here, for example, are a few neatly-expressed 
Bagshottisms. 

" The common saying that you should know every- 
thing of something and something of everything Bagshot 
paraphrases as follows : ' It is necessary to fathom one's 
ignorance on one suhject in order to discover how Uttle 
one knows on other subjects.' ' If the modern world 
abandons the religious idea of sin it will have to recover 
the Greek idea of virtue as a fine art. It is a pity that 
the two cannot be combined. The next nation which 
leads mankind to a higher level of conduct will be one 
which adds conscience to instinctive good taste.' « A 
large number of scholars are men of science gone astray, 
and many editions of classical authors are but chemical 
analyses of their component parts, from which the ele- 
ment of literature is excluded.' 'If science enlarges 
the bounds of knowledge, it also enormously expands 
our conception of the unknown. The modern positive 
and scientific world has a sense of mystery which was 
altogether lacking in the ancient and mediseval world, 
and which is akin to the mysticism of the East. The 
scientific age is that which has the measure of its own 
ignorance.^ ' It is a solemn fact that the discovery of 
a new disease immediately creates a demand for it.'" 

Bagshot's first appearance was made in " The 
Westminster Gazette," of which Mr. Spender is 
editor ; and these chapters are reprinted from its 



pages, where they seem to have attracted unusual 
attention. Their brightness and originality make 
them well worthy of republication in their pres- 
ent more convenient and permanent form. 

Mr. Hubert Bland, author of " Letters to a 
Daughter," and joint author (with his wife, 
"E. Nesbit") of "The Prophet's Mantle," 
cheerfully reappears in " The Happy Moralist," 
a collection of comments and opinions on liter- 
ature, art, music, socialism, love, marriage, 
ethics, and numerous other topics of interest to 
everybody, and offering endless possibilities of 
novel treatment at the hands of each successive 
essayist. Mr. Bland's style is piquant, now and 
then a little cynical, characterized throughout by 
this-worldlLness rather than other-worldliness, 
but never other than light and bright and 
breezy and thoroughly readable. His advice 
on reading presents pretty well the man and his 
methods as a writer. 

" My advice in the matter of literature is, browse 
freely among books, rifle a library as you would rifle a 
garden; confine yourself to no author, to no subject, to 
no century. Boggle not a moment to lay down Milton 
and to take up Herrick; turn without a qualm of con- 
science from The Pilgrim's Progress to The Decameron, 
from Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy to the Arabian 
Nights of the other Burton." 

His counsel to read dead authors rather than liv- 
ing ones, and to select the books that have sur- 
vived, is old and excellent ; but how would there 
ever be any survival of the fittest if all readers fol- 
lowed this advice and waited to see what should 
be cast aside as ephemeral, and what preserved 
for posterity ? Let no man shirk his part in 
the work of weeding out the worthless. In the 
domain of art, more especially modern French 
art, the author thus expresses himself : 

" Remember the aim of Art is not to inculcate 
morality, but to give the Thrill. You can get the 
Thrill easily enough, if you put yourself in the right 
mood, from all these gracious curves and contours, 
these delicate flesh tints, these charming draperies. 
They are the kisses of art, as it were. Neither art nor 
life must be all kisses, but still there is room for kisses 
both in art and life. There is a time to kiss and a 
time to refrain from kissing — a much longer time, 
alas ! Well, these brilliant Frenchmen chose the time 
to kiss, and they immortalized it upon their canvas." 

In words reminiscent of Emerson, to whom he 
acknowledges his indebtedness, Mr. Bland epi- 
grammatically says that " the gist of Good Man- 
ners is to have none." Of all the verbs which 
authors so ingeniously use to avoid over- working 
the verb " say," this author has gone far in his 
quest of the unhackneyed in employing the verb 
" shrug." Many of the Happy Moralist's chap- 
ters are in dialogue form, with a woman as the 



838 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Moralist's interlocutor — which makes for light- 
ness and grace, and relieves the monotony. Those 
who habitually shun " improving " reading will 
like Mr. Bland's sophisticated and sufficiently 
superficial treatment of his themes. 

In " The New Plato, or Socrates Redivivus," 
our old friend the humorist " Tom " Masson 
reappears under the more dignified signature 
Thomas L. Masson, but with as much love of 
fun and laughter as of yore. The temptation to 
parody the Platonic dialogue has been yielded to 
by others before Mr. Masson, but probably no 
parodist has so struck the modern note as he has 
done in his ten brief colloquies on such subjects 
as marriage, gambling in stocks, bridge-playing, 
the tariff, the missionary, college education, 
socialism, and happiness. His English imitates 
successfully, and often amusingly, the Jowett 
style ; in fact, it is plain that Mr. Masson is no 
close student of the original Greek, nor need 
he be for his present purpose. Yet he would 
have done well to submit his proof-sheets to a 
Greek scholar before publication. Our old 
Platonic acquaintance Adeimantos repeatedly 
appears in " The New Plato " under the impos- 
sible form Adaeimantus, and " gynseconitis," to 
denote (apparently) a woman's club or club- 
building, is not happy. The classic tone, so 
well preserved for the most part in the Jowett- 
like forms of expression, is now and then put 
at discord with a neologism that approaches very 
near to slang. " All over," for " everywhere," 
would never have been used by the Master of 
BaUiol, nor, probably, " that is right," to 
indicate simple assent. As a sample of Mr. 
Masson's wares, here is the close of a short dis- 
cussion of the tariif between Socrates and Car- 
nigas. Carnigas speaks : " I might say to you 
that the Tariff benefits the few at the expense 
of the many, and that is why it is imposed on 
all necessities except laborers. For the finan- 
ciers who control the State wish to keep the 
price of everything high which they sell; but 
labor, which they huy^ they wish to obtain at 
the lowest price. But if I said all this you would 
not believe me." To which Socrates replies : 
" O Carnigas, how then could I help but believe 
you, seeing that you have become so rich by just 
such a method ? " 

" The essay," says Sir Conan Doyle toward 
the end of his collected talks on books (under 
the attractive title " Through the Magic Door "), 
" must always be a somewhat repellant form of 
literature, unless it be handled with the lightest 
and deftest touch. It is too reminiscent of the 
school themes of our boyhood — to put a head- 



ing and then to show what you can get under it." 
How true, alas, will both readers and writers 
of essays acknowledge that to be ! Perhaps to 
avoid illustrating its truth, as far as possible, 
the author of " Through the Magic Door " has 
refrained from headings altogether, after having 
once named his book. The unnamed chapters 
are inspired by the writer's old oak bookcase 
containing his favorite volumes, and he is led 
on to talk, confidentially and informally, about 
novels, poetry, history, essays, science, in a way 
that proves his own wide range of literary likings 
and also tends to broaden his reader's outlook 
on the world of letters. The magic door is, of 
course, the door leading into the world of the 
imagination as depicted in the books of great 
authors. In his closing paragraph the writer 
modestly says to his readers : 

" If I have put you on the track of anything which 
you did not know before, then verify it and pass it on. 
If I have not, there is no harm done, save that my breath 
and your time have been wasted. There may be a score 
of mistakes in what I have said — is it not the privilege 
of the conversationalist to misquote ? My judgments 
may differ very far from yours, and my likings may be 
your abhorrence ; but the mere thinking and talking of 
books is in itself good, be the upshot what it may." 

The misquotations (not bad ones) are there, and 
the literary judgments are necessarily of debat- 
able soundness. How many readers, for instance, 
would make " The Cloister and the Hearth" a 
greater novel than " Ivanhoe " ? However, we 
are none the less indebted to this writer of 
novels for letting us know, in so pleasant a way, 
what are some of his favorites among novels, as 
also among works of a more serious nature. As 
an essayist and critic his style is informal and 
agreeable. 

In the opening pages of " The Diary of a 
Looker-on " Mr. C. Lewis Hind frankly con- 
fesses that he has never read " Don Quixote," 
although he has read and heard so much about 
it that, before stopping to reflect, he was almost 
persuaded that his knowledge was first-hand. 
Asking others whether they had read the book, 
he could find no one who had done so. "If 
you mean right through from beginning to end, 
I have n't," was the candid answer of one per- 
son, and the substance of several other answers. 
In the same way, concerning his latest collection 
of hap-hazard reflections on the lesser things of 
life and art and literature, few if any readers 
will be found to have read its three hundred 
and thirty-four closely printed pages " right 
through from beginning to end." A dedicatory 
preface explains that " The Diary of a Looker- 
on " took shape at the suggestion of a friend.

The entries are selected from " fourteen pocket- 
books closely written, a day to a page, records 
of things fancied, seen, felt, that seemed ^worth 
preserving," and have already appeared, wholly 
or in part, in various English periodicals. The 
grouping by months breaks up the book into 
twelve parts or chapters, but the division desig- 
nations might as well have been numerals, or 
the first twelve letters of the Greek alphabet, 
or the twelve labors of Hercules, so little indic- 
ative are they of the subjects treated. As Mr. 
Hind is preeminently an art critic, let us close 
this notice of his freely-rambling diary with a 
suggestive quotation on Color, which he calls 
" The confessional of personality. Like the wind, it is 
there and here at once. It comes from unknown store- 
houses, differing in glory, finding expression in Velas- 
quez's silver greys and flights to red and blue, Titian's 
autumn opulence, and the hasheesh dreams of Monticelli. 
The pursuit of it, assisted by absinthe, drove Monticelli 
crazy until he believed he was a reincarnation of Titian."

In English Gardens.* 



To garden-lovers, every garden has charm ; 
but the English garden is superlatively the 
garden beautiful, with a spell in its very name. 
Books about English gardens are almost always 
fascinating. For the American gardener, dif- 
ferences in climate and other conditions make 
many of their recommendations untrustworthy ; 
but as inspirations to the desire for a garden 
that shall be not merely a place to pick flowers 
out of, but a thing of beauty in itself, these 
books are unrivalled. And if the possession of 
such a garden is denied, a garden-book with the 
right kind of pictures is not to be despised as a 
substitute. 

Just such a book is Miss Margaret Water- 
field's " Flower-Grouping in English, Scotch, 
and Irish Gardens." Smce Miss Waterfield's 
" Garden Colour " was published, she has been 
busy exploring and painting more gardens. 
The color-plates in the new book, of which 
there are more than fifty, are all from her own 
sketches ; but in preparing the accompanying 
text she has been assisted by nearly a dozen 
other garden-lovers. Their diverse points of 
view, — some of them being explicit about genus

and species, bedding plans, and methods of cul- 
ture, while others lean rather toward picturesque 
description of general effects, — lend largeness 
to the outlook of the book. But amid so much 
variety of authorship and opinion, there is no 
lack of essential harmony ; all the writers belong 
to the new school of naturalistic gardeners, who 
protest against any sort of stiff and formal 
arrangement, have a horror of " bedding out " 
and particularly of " carpet-bedding," and adopt 
as their standard Nature's plan of strewing one 
flower about with a lavish hand, or grouping 
together two or three of harmonious coloring. 
So, while there is a special section entitled 
" Wild Garden Notes," all the gardens painted 
and described are of the delightful variety that 
look as if, with Topsy, they " just growed," 
though in fact their artless effects conceal long 
and patient exercise of the gardener's craft. 
Irish and Scotch gardens get high praise for 
their luxuriance, beautiful surroundings, and 
truly artistic arrangement. Of English gardens, 
those of Cornwall are given first place for both 
naturalness and wealth of floral treasures. 

Most of the pictures in Miss Waterfield's book 
will be the despair of those who must do their 
gardening in cramped and temporary quarters. 
Overarching trees as a background for all the 
most beautiful effects, century-old walls with 
ferns and moss in their crannies, " grass- walks " 
and borders that have been unchanged since the 
'40 's, — these are not to be had in a hurry. 
Besides incidental descriptions of the best fea- 
tures of many lovely gardens, there are chapters 
devoted to suggestions for the planting of spring 
bulbs and flowering trees, for rose and lily gar- 
dens, for the selection of climbers for walls and 
pergolas, for water-gardens, and for woodland 
effects. Thus, as a garden-book at once artistic 
and yet fairly practical, Miss Waterfield's leaves 
little to be desired within its chosen field. 

Oddly enough. Miss Gertrude Jekyll's sub- 
ject, "Colour in the Flower- Garden," is one 
that Miss Waterfield has already treated, though 
in quite a different way. Miss Jekyll is inter- 
ested in one particular garden — her own ; and 
judged by pictures and descriptions, it is cer- 
tainly beautiful enough to give warrant for all 
its maker's loving enthusiasm and to provide 
abundant material for many delightful books. 
Like Miss Waterfield, Miss Jekyll prefers nat- 
ural effects. She believes that a garden should 
make a picture, or a succession of pictures ; so 
that color and massing are as important to the 
gardener as to the artist, and should be his first 
and constant study. She is anxious to impress

her readers with the fact that in gardening, as 
in other arts, trifles are all-important. If trel- 
lises are painted an ugly green, the effect of the 
loveliest roses is marred. Supporting sticks 
must be concealed ; bare spaces must be tem- 
porarily filled while the plants in the border are 
growing to cover them. And as in this imper- 
fect world no bed can be in perfection for more 
than a month or two at a time, the skilful gar- 
dener must provide a succession of beauties so 
arranged that the right one will catch the eye 
at the right moment. One exception Miss 
JekyU admits to the rule of not trying to patch 
up one season's border to look well in another : 
the bulb-bed, that problem of the amateur gar- 
dener, is too unsightly to remain through the 
summer. Miss Jekyll's happy suggestion is to 
plant ferns in the bed, instead of scattered 
clumps of herbaceous plants. These wiQ cover 
the bare spaces better and wUl not require any 
of the digging so injurious to the bulbs in mid- 
summer. 

Miss JekyU pays an innocent tribute to her 
faculty for imparting the charm of her garden 
in previous books about it, when, in her pre- 
face, she begs her " kind readers not to take it 
amiss " if she says that she cannot admit 
strangers to her garden, which is at once " her 
workshop, her private study, and place of rest," 
and asks them to spare her failing sight the 
task of writing " long letters of excuse and 
explanation." We can scarcely blame the over- 
enthusiastic persons who have unwittingly made 
Miss Jekyll's life a burden. The photographs 
of her garden are tantalizingly lovely, and, 
colored by her vivid descriptions and suggestive 
comment, they are calculated to make every 
garden-lover sigh with envy. Ten acres of 
woodland threaded by alluring paths, carpeted 
here and there with daffodils and primroses, and 
cleverly blended with the garden proper ; a June 
garden, a border for late summer, a tiny " hid- 
den garden," a grey garden, which ought. Miss 
Jekyll explains, to have a gold garden beside 
it, — these are only a few of Miss Jekyll's 
treasures. Besides the pictures, there are de- 
tailed plans of many of the beds, and of some 
beds she would like to have if there were room 
for them. Everyone with a trace of gardening 
instinct will enjoy Miss Jekyll's book, and those 
who work under anything like the same condi- 
tions will find it very helpful. 

The formal garden gets its share of attention 
in " The Gardens of England in the Southern 
and Western Counties," being the special mid- 
winter number of " The Studio " for 1907-8. 



It is edited by Mr. Charles Holme ; and Mr. 
A. L. Baldry signs one of the three articles 
that make up the text. Of the hundred and 
thirty-six illustrations, eight are in color, the 
work of various artists, and the rest are from 
excellent photographs. In contrast to Miss 
Waterfield and her coadjutors, and to Miss 
Jekyll, the taste of the makers of this book 
leans toward the formal style of garden and the 
more studied type of landscaping. But gar- 
dening on a very large and sumptuous scale is 
bound to be somewhat formal ; and it is the 
great garden, — with its marble statues and 
seats, its sun-dials and fountains, its majestic 
avenues and its grass-walks stretching between 
hedges of box or mossy walls of clipped yew, — 
with which this monograph is concerned, both 
in pictures and text. A brief " History of 
Garden-making " traces the progress of the art 
from the quaint mediaeval type through the 
various stages of formality, fantasy, and pseudo- 
naturalism, to the intelligently composite style 
of to-day. " The Principles of Garden-making " 
formulates briefly such general rules as the 
necessity of keeping the garden in relation to 
the house and the site, and discusses the proper 
combination of formal gardening and landscap- 
ing. There is also a chapter of suggestive notes 
on the illustrations. Of these, the ones in black 
and white are very beautiful ; several of the 
colored plates show such a riot of hues as might 
possibly be pleasing in nature, but is certainly 

garish in art. _

Now Again the Tufted Trees.*" 



Tree-books fill in our library by no means 
the least frequented corner. There is about 
this subject a singular fascination, attracting 
readers and students of every kind and degree. 
A tree is such a strange, weird, inexplicable 
thing, and yet withal so common ! Trees stand 
all about us ; they form the stately background 
of all our human history, nor less of our in- 
dividual human lives. We are by nature lovers 
of a tree, — by instinct, by vaguest memory, 
racial memory perhaps, long and intimate per-

sonal association and acquaintance. Where is 
the happy child who has not played beneath 
these sheltering arms, or laughed to watch the 
flickering shadows of these leaves ? Where is the 
full-grown man, toiling beneath the heat and 
burden of the day, who has not found refreshing 
beneath the shades of some familiar tree ? And 
where is he who does not hope to find at length 
a longer rest beneath some Bethel oak, some 
whispering pine? Our lives begin and end 
among the trees. 

This is the ordinary, the personal, shall we say 
the sentimental view of the subject. But there 
are other and more practical ways of looking at 
this strange type of vegetation. Utility asserts 
itself. Trees make forests for the mountain's 
cover, fuel for the fire, beams for the palace and 
the home ; and architecture of every school pro- 
claims to them its obligation. The Gothic arch 
springs in the pattern of the elm, and all the 
graceful columns of the farther East are but the 
shafts of trees crowned in the richness of their 
flowers and leaves. Nay, the forests of earth 
are its wealth, the wealth of men and peoples. 
Uncounted millions do not tell their value; the 
gold of the Sierras and the silver of Nevada 
have not equalled it. Even as these sentences 
are written, the President of the Republic, the 
Governors of all the States, are met in Wash- 
ington to play statesmen, if possible, for once ; 
to see whether perchance the preservation of 
the natural wealth of trees is a thing feasible 
under republican institutions, or whether stupid 
greed shall rule, while California and the Caro- 
linas are made over into deserts even as Palestine 
and Spain and all the dead empires of the East. 
Small wonder, when we come to think of it, that 
men still write and read and study the books 
that tell of trees ! 

Of the three tree-books treated in this article, 
the first in the list is by far the most pretentious 
and important. Dr. Britton's work on " North 
American Trees " constitutes the third volume 
of a proposed extended series, the " American 
Nature Series," which shall present in popular 
and yet scientific style the whole realm of the 
living world in arrangement, form, and function. 
We have here, accordingly, a descriptive list of 
all arboreal plants growing spontaneously in 
North America north of our Mexican boundary. 
This includes, therefore, not only plants indige- 
nous, but also such types as, having been intro- 
duced from other countries, have now escaped 
cultivation and established themselves as part of 
our common flora. Besides, there is included 
here every species which, though usually a shrub, 



does sometimes aspire to tree-hood by offering 
a single stem. Furthermore, the yuccas are 
described ; but the cacti are omitted. In aU, 
perhaps it is safe to say that we have here the 
longest list of the kind ever offered to English 
readers. 

The descriptions, while scientific, are in gen- 
eral easy of comprehension ; and since each 
specific characterization is accompanied by a 
wood-cut sketch intended to show detail of leaf 
and flower and fruit, identification of the mate- 
rial collected, anywhere from Klondike swamps 
to the everglades and even the islands of Florida, 
would seem a simple matter. The specific dis- 
tinctions are, however, often slight, and in some 
cases are confessedly illusive ; so that the student 
must sometimes be guided by locality rather than 
description. 

The text illustrations are, as far as pertinent, 
from Britton and Brown's " North American 
Flora"; additional cuts illustrate in similar 
fashion all species extra-limitary to that work. 
Besides these, we have in the present volume 
some sixty half-tone reproductions of photo- 
graphs which afford an idea of the particular 
species as illustrated by a typical specimen often 
in its natural surroundings. 

As the work is intended as a hand-book, there 
is less occasion for a display of literary style. 
The author contents himself generally with a 
simple recital of the distinguishing character- 
istics of his plant, not without reference, how- 
ever, to its relationships and its uses. Even 
the splendor of the glorious sugar-pine, or the 
majesty of the hoary sequoias, fails to stir him 
to emotional expression. 

The tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee of nomen- 
clature, and all the inconsistency of the disfigur- 
ing use of capitals in common and scientific 
names, need not here detain us ; but one might 
have hoped that even a poor cottonwood should 
have attained immortality under some other 
specific designation than tweedyi. 

The photographic illustrations are in general 
not so good as this splendid book deserves. They 
fail of doing justice to the subject. If a species 
is to be so portrayed, a specimen for photograph- 
ing should be chosen which, if possible, will show 
the characteristic pose where the type is growing 
at its fairest ; not the poor stunted specimen of 
park or planting. In this book the palms, for 
this reason, are well shown. The figures of the 
white pine and the hackberry, the sycamore and 
the live-oak, do not, as it seems to us, even in 
far-away fashion suggest the beauty and sym- 
metry of these noble trees as still seen in their

valley homes from Wisconsin and Minnesota to 
the Louisiana delta. 

The same criticism must be made on the 
illustrations offered by Messrs. Emerson and 
Weed, in their work entitled " Our Trees : How 
to Know Them." Their volume lays special 
claim to utility on account of its plates. The 
photo-engravings of leaf and flower are good : 
those that display the tree itself are not. The 
figure of the cottonwood, for instance, wotdd 
never suggest the splendid tree familiar to every 
lover of nature who has crossed our western 
prairies. Mr. Hough, in his handbook of Trees, 
is much more successful in displaying the char- 
acteristic appearance of our northern species ; 
and Miss Rogers, in both her tree-books, gives 
more successful portraiture. There is perhaps 
still room for a volume that shall show in full- 
page illustrations typical specimens of all our 
beautiful forest types. 

The third volume in our list, " Trees in 
Nature, Myth, and Art," is practically what its 
title indicates — a book which tells what men 
have thought and said about trees, how artists 
have painted them, rather than a discussion 
of trees themselves. Mr. Phythian talks in a 
pleasant leisurely way about myths and artists 
and art and the more or less scientific fancies of 
unscientific observers ; he shows us in full-pagp 
engravings some pretty pictures, and closes with 
a sentiment which would no doubt command the 
approval of every author who sets his hand to 
write about the forest : 

" If this book should fall into the hands of some, be 
they few or many, who, through reading it, shall come 
to live more with the trees, and to love them better 
than hitherto they have done, then it will not be in vain 
that another has been added to the innumerable host of 
books." 

All three volumes are welcome additions to a 
rapidly growing literature. Dr. Britton's work 
is a notable contribution to the science of his 
country and the world ; Messrs. Emerson and 
Weed have rendered a service to those who 
would identify the species as they move on sum- 
mer outing in our northern woods; while Mr. 
Phythian's book will interest those who, less 
active, still love to lounge in grove or glade and 
dream of the stately procession of the friendly

Game Big and IjITTl,e, Afloat 
AXD Ashore.* 



Imagine, if you can, the mild and serene 
Izaak, patron of good fishermen of the elder 
day, trolling for sea-bats or devil-fish larger than 
the favorite English punt, exchanging the calm 
perfection of his typical cloudy day for the fish- 
ing in Florida which Mr. Holder describes as 
" sitting in a Turkish bath holding a string," 
and all in the interest of the art piscatorial ! 
Yet this appears to be one of the mildest of the 
diversions so graphically pictured — and photo- 
graphed — in " Big Game at Sea," wherein 
squids, octopusses (octopodes or octopi ?), amber 
fish, bonitos, walking fish, rock bass, puff sharks, 
rose-of-paradise fish, sea urchins, hammerhead 
and ground sharks, tunas, yellowtails, barra- 
cudas, sun fish, angel fish (which look like the 
devil), bottle-nosed dolphins, spiny lobsters, 
blue-eyed perch, giant star fish, sea anemones, 
and the new game fish, the yellow-finned tuna, 
appear to have their pictures taken, their fight- 
ing and other habits set forth in detail, and all to 
aid in making a modern American sportsman's 
holiday. 

The capture of some of these giants of the 
deep appears to be much the same sort of diver- 
sion that the prairie Indians found in attempting 
to lassoo the earlier locomotives of the trans- 
continental lines : in a number of authentic 
cases the fish took the man, and made off with 
him, boat and all. The excitement of the chase 
is undoubted, and Mr. Holder leaves the impres- 
sion on his readers that he has had " the time 
of his life " more than once, — as may be in- 
ferred from the list of names given ; the fish he 
caught, or which caught him, being seldom or 
never good to eat ; indeed, there seems to be 
only one appropriate place for feeding on devil- 
fish, which were surely invented after the Fall. 
Instances are given in which the fish not only 
made its escape after being hooked, but returned 
to leap through the sail of the attacking boat 
or to splinter it with natural but efficient 
weapons. Not one of the chapters lacks its 
own peculiar interest. The climax comes with 
the last, in which the yellow-finned tuna, Japa- 
nese albacore, or hirenaga, commands attention 
as a quarry that may run in weight up to a

hundred pounds, and may yet be taken by a 
skilful angler with the ordinary light tackle ! 

" In the Woods and on the Shore " is Mr. 
Richard D. Ware's narrative of the good times 
he has been having at various times and places 
with furred, horned, and feathered creatures in 
their native wilds. Much of his endeavor has 
been in Newfoundland after caribou, the New 
World variety of the reindeer. But the large 
and uncomely moose has been successfully 
pursued by him in New Brunswick ; the black 
bear in assorted sizes, one of them about as 
big as a polo pony, fell to his prowess ; and to 
justify the second clause of his title, he shot 
wild geese, ducks, brant, and many smaller 
sorts of birds, and went a-fishing often as well as 
early. The book has a human side, too, for there 
seems no better way to become acquainted with 
one's fellows — not even the French method, 
of dividing an inheritance with them — than 
by camping out in the wilds with them for a 
season. On some of his longest expeditions, 
Mrs. Ware was a member of the hard-working 
company ; so that this book, unlike most of 
its fellows, has a feminine touch added to its 
other desirable features. The influence of the 
woods, coupled with the single-mindedness 
of the sportsman, has given a simplicity and 
directness to the style that is good to meet, 
and the pages may be aptly described as 
spacious. 

After Mr. Holder's heroic bouts with piscine 
mammoths, Mr. James A. Henshall's " Favorite 
Fish and Fishing " seems tame, but it is at least 
the work of one of the world's great authorities 
on the topics of which it treats. The smaller 
game-fish of the North American continent are 
given full attention, and the work is an authentic 
natural history within its limits, as well as a 
guide to the genuine follower of Walton. Mr. 
Henshall knows the literature of his gentle art 
as well as its practical side, and he sets forth his 
descriptions with an enthusiasm and a grace that 
are decidedly alluring. Fishing is, after all, a 
serious business sometimes — as all can attest 
who have seen stout gentlemen solemnly making 
casts over a grass plot in a city park miles from 
any water ; and this side of the art is never 
absent from these pages, though not with the 
same lack of humor. The book is profusely 
illustrated, every fish discussed having had his 
portrait taken by an artist of repute ; in addi- 
tion, there are many reproduced instantaneous 
photographs, some of them actually showing the 
fish leaping after a strike. 

Mr. Edward Breck's book, " The Wav of the 



Woods," has for its sub-title " A Manual for 
Sportsmen in the Northeastern United States 
and Canada," and it fully justifies this in a 
thorough-going, practical manner. It is to such 
books as these that one goes for information 
about what to take to the woods to insure com- 
fort and health in the way of equipment and 
commissary. Illustrated with diagrams and 
photographs of actual camp-scenes, the novice 
can gain information from it which will enable 
him to avoid many mistakes — even when it 
comes to taking photographs. It goes so far as 
to discuss quite exhaustively the several prob- 
lems presented by having women in the party ; 
it deals with possible illness and injuries, and 
it ends with a good working bibliography where- 
from further knowledge may be gained.

Nature's "Fine Print."* 



" We all read the large type [of Nature] 
more or less appreciatively," says Mr. Bur- 
roughs, " but only the students and lovers of 
Nature read the fine lines and the footnotes." 
His own excellent reading of the fine lines, as 
well as his uncommon appreciation of large type, 
is newly exemplified by " Leaf and Tendril," a 
compilation of recent magazine articles. 

To the question of animal intelligence, which 
is the part of Nature's fine print under most 
careful scrutiny at present, Mr. Burroughs de- 
votes considerable space. And the fact that 
Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, who is also a close 
student, presents an interpretation exactly the 
opposite of his, shows how baffling Nature's text 
is at this point. Mr. Burroughs's belief that 
" the animal is a bundle of instincts, impulses, 
affinities, appetites, and race traits, without the 
extra gift of reason," is well known. Mrs. 
Miller begins her study with the remark that 
" To study them intelligently we have even now 
first to divest ourselves of the old-time notion 
that birds — and beasts as well — are radically 
different from ourselves, that in place of the 
reason which governs, or should govern, our 
conduct, they possess only a blind instinct." 

Mr. Burroughs thinks that the idea of the 
individuality of birds and animals has been 
greatly over-emphasized. He considers that

what is true of one member of a species is 
" practically true of all the others." Mrs. 
Miller quotes with approval from " A Son of 
the Marshes " a quite contrary opinion : "A 
practical naturalist knows that all animals vary ; 
and you will find as much difference, compara- 
tively speaking, in the sizes and dispositions of 
a nest of young birds, or a litter of animals, as 
you will in a family of human beings." 

Mrs. Miller upholds the theory of animal 
"altruism," of the education of the young by 
their parents — and even by their older brothers 
and sisters, — and of sympathy and self-sacrifice ; 
while Mr. Burroughs turns a skeptical ear to the 
stories which apparently prove such theories. 
It is rather discouraging when two such authen- 
tic naturalists show by their disagreement that 
Nature's fine print with regard to animal psy- 
chology has not yet been deciphered. But 
let us have patience, even though the study 
seems long ; for when we have learned how far 
animals are controlled by inherited impulses, 
and how far by reason, we shall have begun the 
solution of the problem with regard to man 
himself. 

Mrs. Miller's book has to do with birds only, 
and collects much evidence from eminent natu- 
ralists with regard to these disputed points. It 
will be a valuable defense for those who uphold 
the same theories, though for pure delight in the 
reading one cannot help grudging the pages that 
are thus taken from the writer's record of her 
own discoveries. 

The scope of Mr. Burroughs's book is broader, 
including much on the general subject of Nature- 
study, with specific references to plants, animals, 
birds — and men. To this are added some self- 
revealing statements of his own philosophy. If 
Mr. Burroughs should not write another book — 
may the fear prove unfounded ! — we shall have 
in " Leaf and Tendril " the summary of his belief 
on many great questions. With him, the study 
of " fine print " has not led to the foot-note habit 
of mind, but to the developing and correlation of 
thought. His philosophy is of the wholesome 
and kindly sort which we like to think belongs 
to those who live much out-of-doors. He has 
practised and approved the simple life — the 
" direct and immediate contact with things, with 
the false wrappings torn away." He has worked 
the " divine soil," and learned from it that "the 
true inwardness of this gross visible world tran- 
scends anything we have dreamed of super- 
terrestrial bodies." He has found " a God in 
the common, the near, always present, always 
active, always creating the world anew." He 



admits that evil follows good as its shadow ; it 
is " inseparable from the constitution of things." 
Yet still he is content, coming to this cheerful 
conclusion : "I would gladly chant a psean for 
the world as I find it. What a migjity inter- 
esting place to live in ! If I had my life to live 
over again, and had my choice of celestial abodes, 
I am sure I should take this planet, and I should 
choose these men and women for my friends and 
companions." ^^^ Estelle Cook. 



A-N Ornithologist at Sea.* 



It is fortunate for science that the Earl of 
Crawford is a sufferer from chronic rheumatism 
and asthma. We are not altogether sure that it 
is not fortunate for the Earl himself ; at least 
he informs us that the impossibility of remaining 
to face the cold and damp of English winters has 
been the cause of his wanderings, — of voyages 
which have led him to many little-known shores, 
and given him innumerable experiences which 
any man might envy. In 1 902 he was preparing 
to go round the world in his splendid yacht, the 
" Valhalla," when it was suggested to him that 
he really ought to bring back something for the 
British Museum. Being himself a trustee of 
that institution, he naturally regarded the idea 
with favor, and as a means of carrying it out 
took steps to add a naturalist to his party. 
Thus it happened that Mr. Michael J. Nicoll 
made three voyages in the " Valhalla," and 
wrote the book which is now before us. 

The work is not, and makes no pretense to 
be, a classic of travel, like Wallace's " Malay 
Archipelago " or Darwin's " Beagle." It is 
merely a pleasantly written accoimt of the 
writer's experiences, accompanied by many ex- 
cellent pictures of scenery and birds. There 
are no important generalizations or philosophical 
observations, no noteworthy contributions to 
geography or sociology, no ambitious attempts 
at word painting. There is, instead, a simple 
realism which permits the reader to accompany 
the author in thought to the various remote 
islands visited, to see them more or less as he 
saw them, and to search with him for the rare 
and new birds so many of them harbored. We 
approach a remote island in the Atlantic or the 
Pacific. It has, perhaps, never been visited by 
any naturalist ; or if so visited, only long ago 
and for a short time. As its rocky shores

appear on the horizon, we wonder what birds 
and other creatures may live upon it. Nearly 
all such islands have pecidiar isolated species, 
found nowhere else in the world. Coming nearer, 
we see vegetation ; that looks promising. Can 
we land? There is a heavy sea on, and the 
surf breaks noisily upon the beach. Sometimes 
it proves necessary to go away without landing, 
leaving the prospective discoveries to some more 
fortunate time and man ; but usually a way is 
found to get to shore, and then the hunt begins. 
Is there any land bird ? If so, it is practically 
certain to be new. The peak must be climbed, 
and the forests examined, or something will be 
missed. Thus we are led on, until we learn of 
success or failure, and the return to the ship, 
always a little regretfully and too soon. 

In the course of the three voyages, eleven 
entirely new birds were obtained, all on islands. 
In addition, many interesting observations were 
made on little-known species, and some good 
material was collected in other groups of ani- 
mals. Thus on the island of Aldabra, north of 
Madagascar, the very rare Abbott's Ibis, known 
from no other place, was found. Mr. Nicoll 
was very anxious to obtain a photograph, and 
approached a group of them very cautiously with 
his camera. The precaution was needless ; the 
birds, not accustomed to the wiles of man, were 
not only fearless, "but so inquisitive that they 
waded across the pool, and, coming close up to 
the camera, began to peck at the tripod. We 
drove them back to the rocks, but before a 
plate could be exposed they were back again 
inspecting the legs of the camera ; it was only 
by repeated threats — a novel experience for 
them and for us — that we could keep them far 
enough away to enable us to get a series of 
photographs in proper perspective " (p. 121). 
The result, as presented to us in the book, is a 
couple of the finest bird pictures we have ever 
seen. 

We cannot take the space to tell here about 
the visit to Easter Island, and the new bird

equally to those who are obliged to make their 
voyages in an arm-chair, and to those who have 
the time and means to travel abroad in a cor- 
poreal capacity. ^^ ^^ _^_ Cockerell. 



Highways and Byways of Travel..* 



The author of " The Log of the ' Laura ' in Polar 
Seas," Mrs. Bettie Fleischmann Holmes, may well 
congratulate herself on the mechanical make-up of 
her volume. The University Press of Cambridge 
has recently been exhibiting some fine specimens of 
the printer's craft, and this book is not the least 
beautiful it has produced. The paper is hand- 
made from an Italian mill ; the type is the exellent 
" Bodoni " face, designed and used exclusively by 
the University Press ; and the illustrations — photo- 
gravure prints from untouched negatives — are all 
of superlative merit. The half -leather binding, too, 
is pleasing and serviceable. The sub-title of Mrs. 
Holmes's volume, " A Hunting Cruise from Tromso, 
Norway, to Spitsenbergen, the Polar Ice of Green- 
land, and the island of Jan Mayen, in the summer 
of 1906," very adequately describes the course of 
the " Laura " in the far North Seas. For eleven 
weeks the party cruised about in search of the pic- 
turesque, and more especially for the big and little 
game which the Arctic regions afford. The reader 
may incline to smile at the author's tale of the dis- 
comforts encountered, when he reads of the com- 
pleteness of the outfit provided by the leader of the 
company. Colonel Max Fleischmann of Cincinnati ; 
but it should be remembered that the ice was 
heavier and the conditions generally worse in the 
summer of 1906 in the regions visited than they 
had been for several years past. By far the most 
entertaining part of the book deals with the hunts 
for the great Polar bears. As thorough-going sports- 
men, bent on the quest of game, the party cannot 
be blamed for any lack of sentiment ; yet the calm 
brutality manifested in the following account of a 
killing is, happily, not often encountered. A mother 
bear and her two cubs were seen, — 

" The old one, followed by her young, going with her great 
ambling strides over the floes, jumping into and swimming 
rapidly across all intervening water. When we were

within range cameras were first brought into play, and then 
Colonel Fleischmann with a well-directed shot hit the larger 
bear, which tumbled back into the water. She was hit in 
the side, the bullet ranging through her lungs and passing 
close to the heart. Dr. Holmes and Mr. Learmonth each 
brought down one of the cubs. They rolled about, growling 
loudly, and staggered and crawled fully one hundred yards 
after being hit. One was in advance, but the second man- 
aged to reach him, and they lay one on the top of the other 
when found." 

The author fails in breathing a distinct personality 
into her account, — a failure, no doubt, which may 
be a virtue in a log-book. 

After failing in his attempt to climb Mount 
McKinley, in 1903, Dr. Frederick A. Cook came to 
the following conclusion : 

"Mt. McKinley offers a unique challenge to mountain- 
eers, but its ascent will prove a prodigious task. It is the 
loftiest mountain in North America, the steepest mountain 
in the world, and the most arctic of all great mountains. The 
area of this mountain is far inland, in the heart of a most 
difficult and trackless country, making the transportation of 
men and supplies a very arduous task. The thick under- 
brush, the endless marshes, and the myriads of vicious mos- 
quitos bring to the traveller the troubles of the tropics. The 
necessity for fording and swimming icy streams, the almost 
perpetual cold rains, the camps in high altitudes of glaciers 
in snows and violent storms, bring to the traveller all of the 
discomforts of the arctic explorer. The prospective conqueror 
of America's culminating peaks will be amply rewarded, 
but he must be prepared to withstand the tortures of the 
torrids, the discomforts of the north pole seeker, combined 
with the hardships of the Matterhorn ascents multiplied 
many times." 

But on September 16, 1906, Dr. Cook, with a 
single companion, Edward Barrille, accomplished 
the ascent and stood on " the top of the continent," 
at an altitude of 20,390 feet. The record of Dr. 
Cook's two expeditions is interestingly, even thrill- 
ingly, told in the volume entitled " To the Top of 
the Continent." Hunters, prospectors, adventurers, 
geographers, and the casual reader will each find 
food for his particular appetite in this well-told nar- 
rative. Excellent photographic illustrations, many 
drawings and maps, appendices written by various 
members of the expeditions (giving accounts of the 
natives, the fauna and flora, the geology, and the 
routes of proposed railways in Alaska), and an 
excellent frontispiece in color from a painting by 
Mr. Russell W. Porter, enhance the value and 
attractiveness of the volume. 

Mrs. Fanny Bullock Workman and Mr. William 
Hunter Workman, in their book entitled " Ice-Bound 
Heights of the Mustagh," show in detail what a seri- 
ous sport mountain-climbing may become. The story 
of their climbs in the ice-world of the Himalaya is a 
record of scientific observations and discoveries com- 
prehensible only to those who are masters of the 
science of geography, and of interest only to those 
who have some knowledge of mountain-climbing, or 
those who wish to enlarge their information regard- 
ing the physiography of the world. Here and there 
in the book the general reader will find gome ordinary 
statement of fact that will interest him. He will find 
pleasure in reading the descriptions of the many 
mountain peaks in the Himalaya which seem to bear 



a distinct individuality, and he will be forced to recon- 
struct his pigmy ideas of the vastness of the world. 
Ordinary standards of heights and distances are in- 
adequate in estimating the immensities of these 
Titanic mountains of the Mustagh. " This fact," 
say the authors, "is accounted for by the much 
greater altitudes and dimensions of the Himalayan 
snow- world, and by the wonderfully clear atmosphere 
which causes distant points to appear near. The 
mind is also dazed and overwhelmed by the immen- 
sity, and fails to comprehend it." Mr. and Mrs. 
Workman, however, know this snow-world ; they 
have lived in it and have absorbed something of its 
atmosphere. Hence, their volume, though uninter- 
esting in many parts, gives the reader a proper con- 
ception of the vastness and remoteness of these giants 
of the earth. They have been fortunate, too, in 
their photographic work ; no such satisfactory pic- 
tures of mountain scenery have been published since 
Mr. Douglas Freshfield's " Round Kangchenjunga " 
was issued in 1904. We wish, however, that the 
authors had used their pens more in describing these 
impressive scenes. Our complaint only indicates 
that the writers were more scientific than literary 
in their pursuit ; and as mountain climbers bent on 
increasing the world's knowledge of scientific geo- 
graphical data, they have succeeded to an unusual 
degree. 

It has been well said that no one knows anything 
about the Japanese except the Japanese themselves — 
and they will not tell. Miss Augusta M. Campbell 
Davidson, in her volume entitled "Present Day 
Japan," verifies this saying by citing her many hope- 
less attempts to exchange ideas with the Japanese. 

" As a rule, I observe, they do not care to tell you too much 
about their country's past. They do not mind a picturesque 
legend, or a story of a grand battle, but they do not like you 
to know too much about their constitutional history, and it 
is well to betray superfluous information on points of this 
kind. There is a desire on the part of a good many of them 
to glide rather gently over the fact of the nonentity of the 
Mikado during so many centuries (to take one instance J, so 
as to give an air of antiquity to existing institutions. ... I 
am told by those who can read them that the same tendency 
is to be discovered in the text-books of history used in the 
schools." 

" If you could manage to get beliind the polite phrases of 
the most educated of Japanese you would find a profound 
conviction of the superiority of his country to every other to 
be at the root of his views on all subjects whatsoever. He 
certainly speaks to you very humbly about his country and 
very respectfully about yours. Everything in Japan, accord- 
ing to him, is poor and inferior, everything in your country 
all that is desirable. You may say as much as you like to 
try to convince him that there are certain things in your 
country that you do not particularly admire, and that you 
really do think much of certain things in his. He does not 
in the least mean what he says, and you may talk to the end 
of time without convincing him that you mean what you 
say. . . . There is not a Japanese alive who does not think 
his country worth any six of the countries of the West, but 
there is none who would be rude enough to say so. They 
act on this view all the same, and it is this, contrasted with 
their polite verbal depreciation, which gets them the character 
of being such unmitigated humbugs." 
These quotations will serve to show that the author 
has, to some extent, arrived at a fair understanding 



1908.]

of Japanese psychology. Her knowledge, moreover, 
is not mere snap observation, but is founded upon a 
study of the ethical forces and the national religion 
of the Japanese, their daily goings in and comings 
out, — their social life, and their amusements. 
Though in no sense a heavy discourse, this revised 
edition of a series of letters home to English friends 
is complete in giving a wide and varied view of 
Japanese life. In brief, there are few books about 
Japan more illuminating and entertaining than this 
one. 

The principal motive of Sir Hubert Jerningham's 
trip around the world was a desire to see Japan. 
His account of the journey, as told in the volume 
entitled " From West to East," is consequently de- 
voted largely to the Land of the Rising Sun. More 
than half of the volume recounts his visits to the 
principal Japanese cities. Each city was evidently 
viewed for some single interesting fact or experi- 
ence illustrative of the general course of Japanese 
life. Thus, Osaka invites a discourse on wealth, 
Kyota on Old Japan, Nara on bronzes, Nagoya on 
wrestling, and Yokohoma on Japanese art. Nikko 
interests Sir Hubert because of its temples, Tokyo 
because of its educational ideas, and Kobe because 
of its progressiveness. Japanese religion, too, 
everywhere attracted Sir Hubert's attention and 
criticism. Mukden and Port Arthur were visited, 
and the famous battles which took place there are 
fought over again in detail, — though the author 
disclaims all practical and theoretical knowledge of 
warfare. The rest of the world receives scant 
treatment in the volume. San Francisco, Chicago, 
Niagara, and New York are dismissed in the short 
space of one chapter. An appendix gives Admiral 
Togo's " Report of the Battles of the Sea of Japan" 
and the French text of the Treaty of Portsmouth. 
A reading of this book leads one to look upon the 
author's report of his six months' journeying as a 
sort of disjecta membra, written by a man who is 
capable of more valuable and entertaining writing 
than is contained in the present volume. 

Twenty-five years of drudgery at the New York 
bar brought Mr. George L. Carlisle to the necessity 
of choosing between breaking down or breaking 
away. Selecting the latter course, Mr. Carlisle took 
a year off and started on a trip around the world. 
Habits of activity with the pen would not, however, 
allow him to rest entirely, so he wrote an account 
of his journey. The resulting volume, entitled 
"Around the World in a Year," would merit but 
little attention were it not for the author's genial 
good sense, his freshness of observation, his odd 
turns of speech, his delightful scorn of all things 
praised by those more scholastically inclined, and 
his almost sinful disrespect for venerable objects, 
both sacred and profane. It is not given to every 
writer to speak in light terms of the ancient mummy 
of Rameses II., to characterize the mountains of 
Greece as " a fine lot of old timers," and to insist 
that the beauties of Japan have been over-praised 



although admitting at the same time that his view 
may have been perverted by a severe attack of the 
itch while in the Mikado's country. Among the 
places which caught Mr. Carlisle's fancy and tickled 
his humor, Carlsbad holds first place. " It is an 
expensive place. Others go there for their health, 
but the hotel proprietors do not." A mud-bath ex- 
perience leads to some highly humorous remarks on 
the efficacy of this operation in relation to running 
for office in America. No country escapes without 
some gibe from the author's facile pen. The judi- 
cious reader may be grieved at Mr. Carlisle's irrev- 
erent tone, but he will find many compensations in 
the shrewd humor and the keen interpretations of 
the New York barrister. 

No one contemplating a motor trip through En- 
gland, Wales, or Scotland should neglect a cursory 
reading of Mr. Thomas D. Murphy's " British High- 
ways and By-ways from a Motor Car." The volume 
bears a distinctive value in one respect: it recites 
the attractions of some of the lesser-known villages 
and towns seldom visited by the '* quick-tripper." 
Ludlow, for example, though known to students of 
literary history as the place where Milton's " Comus " 
was first presented, is seldom mentioned in accounts 
of tours in Britain. Mr. Murphy, however, is 
almost extravagant in his praise of the village. 

"After visiting hundreds of historic places during our 
summer's pilgrimage, the memory of Ludlow, with its quaint, 
unsullied, old-world air, and its magnificent church, whose 
melodious chime of bells lingers with us yet, its great ruined 
castle, redolent with romance, and its surrounding country 
of unmatched interest and beauty, is still the pleasantest of 
all. If we could re-visit only one of the English towns it 
would be Ludlow." 

Should any prospective traveller through Britain be 
fortunate enough to make his trip in a motor car, 
he will find Mr. Murphy's book an excellent guide ; 
the maps of England and Scotland are suggestive 
road guides, and the incidental information about 
hotels and garages will save many moments of 
worry. The volume contains numerous and excel- 
lent illustrations, reproduced both in color and tint. 

Seven sketches of travel in Italy, Sicily, and 
Greece make up the contents of Mr. T. R. Sullivan's 
" Lands of Summer." " Spring-Time with Theo- 
critus," the first chapter, has but little to do with 
spring-time, and still less with the bucolic poet ; it 
really recounts the author's mishaps on a May-Day 
at Catania in Sicily, when he was held up in this 
miserable little village by labor-union decrees and 
strikes, thus upsetting his plans and retarding his 
progress toward Greece. In Greece, too, the un- 
expected and the distressing were always happen- 
ing, — so much so that Mr. Sullivan coined the 
expression, " In Greece expect the unexpected." 
The author agrees with many other travellers that 
the road from Corinth to Patras, along the Corinthian 
Gulf, with views " across the blue waves to Helicon 
and Parnassas, up the bay of Itea to the white gleam 
of Delphi," is probably the finest railway journey 
in the world. Yet he chooses to dismiss the prospect 



348

and to disappoint our hopes by the mere assertion. 
But the other chapters of the book are less disappoint- 
ing. The reader will enjoy the restful accounts of 
the author's journeyings in Tuscany, of the trips from 
Poppi, the description of Camaldoli and of Abetone — 
" the finest spot on earth." No less interesting is 
the chapter entitled "The Centenary of Alfieri at 
Asti." As this celebration happily coincided in 1903 
with that of Asti's movable autumnal feast, the vint- 
age, Mr. Sullivan not only witnessed Salvini's last 
performances in the dramatist's greater plays, but 
also enjoyed seeing the " continuous procession of 
the white oxen, bulls, or cows, yoked in pairs," cir- 
cling round the great square of Asti, " draggling loads 
of purple grapes along the Corso and its tributaries, 
to every courtyard in town." The romantically- 
inclined reader will find pleasure in the chapter 
entitled '< The Wraith of a Ducal City," telling the 
story of how Duke Vespasian Gonzaga built at 
Sabbioneta a marvellous city, which he intended 
should be only a lesser Athens. This Kubla Khan 
caused streets, squares, pleasure-grounds, palaces, 
theatres, churches, colonnades, and triumphal arches 
to be planned and constructed with amazing swift- 
ness and incredible beauty. But when he died, in 
1590, the people whom he had forced to live in his 
capital city fled from the gilded environment, and 
to-day Sabbioneta stands desolate, — " magnificent, 
with empty courts and grass-grown streets, fortified 
against all but neglect and the treacherous enmity of 
time. Her glory had departed ; and no man ever 
dreamed of reviving it." Text, pictures, and binding 
are all of a spirit in this dainty book, making it an 
unusually pleasant volume for reading and possession. 

The little volume entitled " Panama and Back " 
recounts Dr. Henry T. Byford's trip to the Pan- 
American Medical Congress held at Panama in 
1904. His story, however, mentions only a reason- 
able proportion of the events which occurred at the 
meeting of the medical men, but contains much of 
the physician's personal experience. The result of 
his observation is that, after trying everything, 
seeing everything, and discussing everything with 
learned and unlearned persons, he is convinced that 
everything in Panama is wrong or distorted, and 
everything or nearly everything in Chicago is right 
or nearly right. His summary of his trip is re- 
vealed in the comments, "Very pleasant, but warm 
and sunshiny," and " It was a great success and I 
got back safely." The worthy physician is never at 
a loss for a pun. In commenting on a bull-fight, he 
says : " It was neither a hull fight nor a bully fight, 
it was merely a fight between bulls and buUies." 
Those who appreciate this sort of word-play will 
find a plethora of it in Dr. Byford's book. The 
more diligent reader will occasionally find some per- 
tinent and sensible remarks on affairs in Panama, 
especially on the canal. 

The rapid pace of Mr. John U. Higinbotham's 
dash through the Netherlands, as recorded in his 
volume entitled " Three Weeks in Holland and 



Belgium," may be judged from this specimen day's 
itinerary : " July 27 : Left Alkmaar 8:25 A. M.; 
arrived Hoorn 8:45 a.m.; left Hoorn 9:56 a.m.; 
arrived Enkhuisen 10:25 A. M.; boat to Stavoren, 
1:39 P.M.; arrived Stavoren 2:49 P.M.; left Stavoren 
2:57 P. M.; arrived Sneek 3:24 p. M.; left Sneek 
7:12 p. M.; arrived Leeuwarden 7:53 p. M." Such 
a day must not be taken as wholly typical, however, 
for Mr. Higinbotham was more leisurely at times, 
spending one whole day in Amsterdam, another day 
in Brussels, and a third day in Antwerp. Although 
the author evidently travelled with an accurately set 
watch in one hand and a " rundreise " time-table in 
the other, he made excellent use of his eyes. Of 
humor Mr. Higinbotham has his due share, as wit- 
ness these examples : " At Assen we are scheduled 
for three hours in a fifteen-minute town." " The 
Dutch have a dry sense of humor. Their new 
church in Amsterdam was built in 1408. I asked 
the concierge if he thought the plastering thoroughly 
dry. They have also an exaggerated notion of the 
speed of an American pedestrian. If they tell you 
that anything is within fifteen minutes' walk, and 
you reach it in half an hour, you have probably 
broken a record." Of the family which owns the 
house at Hougomont on the battlefield of Waterloo, 
Mr. Higinbotham writes : "They plant little biollets 
and souvenirs. These are sown in the fall, and the 
winter snows and spring rains bring them to per- 
fection. Early in the summer they are ploughed 
up and sold to the credulous." Mr. Higinbotham's 
observations are so acute and well-balanced that we 
should like to have fuller records of his journeys. 

Those readers of books of travel who enjoy diluted 
facts of strange life in fictional form will find a book 
to their liking in Miss Caroline Corner's volume 
bearing the title "Ceylon: The Paradise of Adam." 
Having resided in the island for seven years, the 
author writes of the many peculiar institutions, 
customs, and manners of the Ceylonese. Much of 
the book is written in dialogue, with comments in 
solution, — a method of composition which calls the 
reader's imagination into play, but which does not 
entirely satisfy any desire he may have for an ex- 
tended explanation of Ceylonese life. If we are to 
believe the records of this volume, life in Ceylon is 
more interesting and diverting than in any other 
part of the world. Our own view is that Miss Corner 
would have pleased the general reader more if she 
had been more expository and less fictional in her 
narrative. 

The " Isle " of Purbeck, described in Miss Ida 
Woodward's volume entitled " In and Around the 
Isle of Purbeck," is in reality a peninsula, situated 
at the south-east corner of the county of Dorset, and 
covering an area of one hundred and twenty square 
miles. To the local English historian, the geologist, 
the antiquarian, and the seeker of the picturesque, 
this area is of importance ; but for the general reader 
it has little interest. Celt, Saxon, Roman, English, 
and even Phoenician, have left their trail in the

famous Kimmeridge clay of Purbeck ; and the 
English Kings, from the time of mythical Arthur 
to Charles I., have ever held Purbeck in high honor 
as a place renowned for hunting. In its earliest days 
it was the scene of many miracles worked by now 
forgotten worthies of the church. In these later days 
it is famous for its clay, which is shipped to all parts 
of the world. But above all things, it is best known 
for its varied and beautiful scenery ; hills, dales, 
woodlands, marshes, rugged coasts, and valleys give 
a charm which " age cannot wither nor custom stale." 
For this reason. Miss Woodward's account offers 
unusual opportunities to the artist, Mr. John W. G. 
Bond, whose series of thirty-six plates in color forms 
a most attractive feature of the volume.

They may register a faint objection to it on the

govern themselves. The central political situation 
of the present novel is found in a compaign for the 
governorship — a campaign in which the old order 
triumphs, but which reveals the handwriting on the 
wall. The love interest is supplied by the daughter 
of the railroad magnate and the son of his trusted 
corporation counsel. These are of the new genera- 
tion, and both have to face the problem of a duty 
divided between the promptings of filial piety and 
the clear conviction that their respective fathers are 
hopelessly in the wrong. This has long been a 
favorite situation with our novelists of tendency, and 
Mr. Churchill uses it with striking success. Thus 
far we have said nothing of Mr. Crewe, whom we 
should expect from the title of the story to be the 
chief figure, which he certainly is not, although he 
is an interesting one. This gentleman is a pompous 
and self-sufficient millionaire with a sense of duty 
(about equally divided between his own important 
self and the public), who magnanimously decides to 
offer his services to the commonwealth. He becomes 
first a legislator, then a candidate for the governor- 
ship. He is so thickly encased in the armor of con- 
ceit that he cannot dream of being taken at a less 
serious estimate than his own, and becomes an '' easy 
mark " for the predatory politicians who flatter and 
bleed him at the same time. His is the most care- 
fully studied character in the novel, which perhaps 
justifies the title; but the leading interest centres 
about the others. Mr. Churchill, as we all know, 
is no outsider when it comes to writing about New 
Hampshire politics, and his satirical and vivid ac- 
count of the gubernatorial campaign shows in many 
ways that the writer has been in the midst of the 
fray. His book is too long, is rather loosely put 
together, and the manner of its setting forth is 
almost slovenly at times, but it is a story that has 
vitality, is informed by a fine idealism, and is pos- 
sessed of an interest that does not pall. 

"King Spruce" is a novel that takes us to the Maine 
woods under the guidance of a man who knows them, 
not only as a camper and nature-lover, but also as 
one acquainted with the practical business of lum- 
bering and conversant with its highly specialized 
dialect. There is too much of this technical speech 
for easy reading, but we do not need to understand 
all the terms employed to enjoy the tale, which is 
both virile and exciting. The hero is a college man, 
which would seem to be against him were the 
unfavorable impression produced by the fact not 
promptly modified by the information that his chief 
distinction had been won upon the football field. 
He finds teaching in the country school a little too 
tame for his taste, and sets out to beard the lumber 
magnate in his forest lair, having previously won 
the affections of the magnate's daughter. His peace- 
ful overtures having been met with scorn and con- 
tumely, he proceeds to make himself really respected 
by starting a rival enterprise, and, incidentally, by 
applying the methods of scientific forestry to his 
work. He conquers the bully who acts as foreman of 
the enemy, dynamites the dam which gives the enemy

ization all along the line. King Spruce then comes 
to terms, and the hero marries the fair daughter 
with her father's blessing. Mr. Holman Day, the 
author of this book, is clearly an enthusiastic cham- 
pion of the cause of our wasted forests, but the cause 
is unobtrusively urged, which is perhaps as effective 
a way of urging it as the hammer-and-tongs method 
resorted to by others. That it is a cause of the ut- 
most importance to our national welfare will hardly 
be doubted by any well-informed American. 

" Old Wives for New," the latest invention of Mr. 
David Graham Phillips, is a novel with a prologue. 
The prologue is a summer day's idyl in southern 
Indiana, the tale of a boy and a girl falling reck- 
lessly in love before either of them has learned any- 
thing of the realities of life. The sensuous note is 
forced, but the effect comes close to being poetical. 
In the long-winded tale that follows, poetry has dis- 
appeared, its place being taken by a particularly sor- 
did sort of prose. The boy has become a man, and 
even a magnate, while the girl whom he had made 
his wife has grown fat and slovenly. The author 
leaves nothing to our imagination on this score, for 
he describes the reasons for the husband's estrange- 
ment with disgusting detail. Presently, the man goes 
off for a summer's outing in the northern wilderness, 
and there meets a woman whose delicacy and refine- 
ment are in striking contrast with the vulgarity and 
dowdiness of his wife. This woman, incidentally, is 
the proprietor of a fashionable dressmaking establish- 
ment in New York. The development of the story 
deals with the man's efforts to obtain a divorce, and 
with his wife's jealous opposition to the scheme. 
Eventually, she is forced to consent, after which she 
resorts to " beauty-doctors," renews her youth, and 
succumbs to the wiles of the treacherous and fortune- 
seeking secretary of her former husband. The latter, 
instead of seeking at once the woman he loves, aims 
at first to protect her name from connection with the 
scandalous situation. This he accomplishes by the 
ingenious device of persuading a girl of easy virtue 
to go with him to Paris, and by making the most 
ostentatious display of their association. The dear 
public is thus diverted from its scent, and the reputa- 
tion of the dressmaker is saved from blemish. It 
would appear that the author expects us to consider 
this a most praiseworthy performance, and quite 
enough to condone the man's offenses. It would be 
useless to try to find a moral in this incoherent fab- 
rication, which is one of the most revolting books, in 
both incident and general plan, that we have ever 
read. 

For a book not to be taken seriously in any liter- 
ai'y sense, without either form or style, but having 
the characteristics of surprise and excitement that 
go to the making of an entertaining yarn, we may 
say a word of mild commendation in behalf of " The 
Sixth Speed," by Mr. E. J. Rath. It tells of an 
ingenious chauffeur who wearies of his menial ser- 
vice, calls his millionaire employer " a damn fool," 
thereby separating himself from his job, and turns 



pirate in very up-to-date fashion. He invents, or 
somebody invents for him, a new motor which will 
propel a boat at the speed of more than a hundred 
miles an hour. His boat is secretly built and 
equipped, a trusty crew is secured, and he starts out 
to plunder the yachts of the wealthy. Audacity is 
his weapon, for all brutal arms are forbidden, and 
his lightning-like appearances and disappearances 
strike terror into the hearts of the owners of the 
pleasure squadron. The matter becomes so serious 
that the United States navy takes a hand, trying in 
vain to capture the bold buccaneer, and at last even 
international complications are produced by his 
deeds. A part of his equipment being a Marconi 
outfit, he reads all the wireless messages that are sent 
concerning him, and thus eludes capture. Huge re- 
wards are offered, at first for him, and then to him, 
with the promise of immunity, but he prefers to 
remain the terror of the seas. But an imminent 
war between the United States and Japan arouses 
his patriotism, and he decides to surrender, in order 
that he may place his motor at the service of the 
government. What is done to him after that we are 
not informed, for the closing passage of a perfunctory 
love story takes the place of the final explanation 
that we are awaiting. 

To "The Spoilers" succeeds "The Barrier," a 
second story of Alaska much like the first. The 
scene is a trading-post which a lucky " strike" trans- 
forms into a mining camp; the hero is an army 
officer who for the first time brings governmental 
authority into the region ; the heroine is a dusky 
maiden supposed to be a half-breed but in reality of 
pure white parentage ; the miscellaneous characters 
include two " bad men " and a big-hearted French 
Canadian who loves the heroine in secret, saves her 
by a daring exploit, and resigns her to his rival. 
Fighting goes on intermittently throughout the tale, 
and red blood courses in the veins of the men, some 
of it being spilled from time to time. It is all good 
thrilling conventional melodrama, written by a man 
with an eye for actuality and a sense of dramatic 
fitness. 

" Fennel and Rue " is hardly more than a novel- 
ette in volume, and rather less tha-n that in sub- 
stance. Mr. Howells seems to have surpassed his 
own previous efforts in spinning a considerable 
story out of a trifling incident. A young novelist 
receives a pathetic letter from an unknown young 
woman, takes it in good faith, and afterwards learns 
that it was only a trick. His pride is hurt, and he 
now takes the matter seriously in another way, 
writing the young woman a rather brutal letter. 
This is the prelude. The sequel brings the two to- 
gether in a country house, and he learns that his 
letter has had serious consequences, for the young 
woman is just recovering from the serious nervous 
illness which it occasioned. She is also a particu- 
larly nice girl. The conclusion would be obvious 
were we dealing with another than Mr. Howells. 
The actual conclusion is whimsical, and anything 
but flattering to the hero's conceit. It is all very

charming and slyly humorous in the working out, 
but cannot be said to engage any serious interest- 
It is some time since we have read a story of the 
American Revolution, and a fairly good one is now 
offered us by Mr. Stephen Jenkins, who calls it 
" A Princess and Another." The hero appears to us 
when a child, brought to New York by a French- 
woman whose services are sold in payment for her 
passage. The child is not her own, but the secret 
of his birth remains concealed for many years. The 
young woman is presently wooed and won by a 
Quaker farmer of the neighborhood, and the boy 
thus finds a happy home among respectable hard- 
working people. His education is provided for, and 
at the outbreak of the war he is a fine young fellow 
in early twenties. He has an adventurous career, 
not becoming an ardent partisan of either cause, but 
serving for a time, more by accident than from 
conviction, in the tory ranks. He gets into trouble 
with the colonial forces, being found within their 
lines and taken for a spy, although his errand is of 
private concern only. Things look dark for him at 
first, but the devotion of the heroine produces the 
evidence that clears him at the critical moment, and 
at the same time he discovers his long-lost father in 
one of the French officers taking part in his trial. 
The story is mildly interesting, rather more roman- 
tic than real in plot and characterization, but is 
anchored with reasonable security to the essential 
facts of the historical situation. 

" Prisoners of Chance," by Mr. Randall Parrish, 
is a romance of adventure based upon the history of 
Louisiana in the later eighteenth century. The time 
is that of Spanish rule, and the story is set in opera- 
tion by the French attempt of 1768 to regain pos- 
session of the province. The leaders of the revolt 
are captured, sentenced to death, and confined upon 
a Spanish warship to await their execution. One of 
the prisoners is a certain Charles de Noyan, married 
to a French girl whose hand had formerly been sought 
by one Geoffrey Benteen, an English adventurer, 
who has spent many years in the wilderness fighting 
Indians and trading in furs. It is Geoffrey who 
tells the story, which begins with his arrival in New 
Orleans after several years' absence. His former 
love learns of his arrival, and appeals to him to save 
her husband. Being a resourceful man, this task 
is accomplished, and the three make their escape 
together in a boat headed up the great river. When 
the Arkansas is reached, they take to that stream, 
having added to their party a strange companion in 
the person of a red-headed Yankee, a puritan 
preacher, valiant both as fighter and trencher-man, 
whose language upon all occasions is that of the con- 
venticle. Penetrating to the Ozark region, they come 
upon a strange tribe of natives, by whom they are 
taken captive. These natives, the author would have 
us believe, were the last remnant of the mound- 
builders, a savage race with strange rites and cus- 
toms. But, strange to say, they are ruled by a white 
queen, a Frenchwoman, who in some imexplained 
manner has gained the ascendancy over them. She 



is a cruel and passionate creature, who somehow 
reminds us of the " She " of Mr. Rider Haggard's 
invention. The prisoners are condemned to be sacri- 
ficed, but contrive to escape after many exciting 
adventures, including the experience of a convulsion 
of nature that exterminates their savage captors, as 
well as the Puritan and the Frenchman. The latter 
is a poor thing, and we are not sorry to lose him, 
particularly as his wife is clearly predestined for 
Geoffrey, and has loved him all the time. So the 
two survivors, being hurriedly united in marriage by 
a French priest conveniently produced for the pur- 
pose, start on their journey back to civilization, and 
the story ends. It is an excellent example of the 
sort of romantic narrative which Mr. Parrish has 
cultivated with marked success, and upon which he 
has brought to bear the fruits of much serious his- 
torical investigation. 

Readers of current fiction have learned to expect 
a book by Mr. J. C. Snaith to be something out of 
the ordinary. " William Jordan, Junior " certainly 
fulfils this expectation, for a stranger book — at 
once puzzling and fascinating — has not often come 
our way. The hero is introduced to us as a boy, 
the sole companion of his father, who is a venerable 
scholar gaining a scant livelihood as the owner of a 
second-hand book shop in London. The boy has 
had almost literally no contact with the real world, 
and his mind has been fed upon the ancient classics 
to the exclusion of almost everything else. Greek 
is more familiar to him than his native English, and 
the only ideals he knows have been shaped by com- 
munion with the poets and philosophers of antiquity. 
We are called upon to follow the development of 
this naive and sensitive spirit as it is brought into 
contact with various aspects of common life, from 
the day when the boy first takes his father's hand 
to be led out into the world of " street persons " to 
the day when the man, having toiled and suffered 
and felt the springs of sympathy welling up within 
his soul, lies upon his deathbed, leaving as his legacy 
to mankind a marvellous poem — the very epic of 
humanity — which has been distilled from his ex- 
perience. Four passages of his life are described 
for us with some particularity. First, the period 
which he spends in a day school for boys, where he 
first learns that there is such a thing as brutality in 
the world ; second, the years passed in clerical 
drudgery for a firm of publishers ; third, a term of 
imprisonment for an offence technically criminal 
although committed from the purest of motives ; 
and fourth, a season of wanderings, in which con- 
tact with all sorts and conditions of men is alternated 
with rapt communings with nature. These influ- 
ences, projected upon the background of his child- 
hood training, are what go to make of him a living 
soul, and are so blended for good and beauty that 
something like awe takes possession of us as we 
watch his dying hours. And to emphasize the ideal 
and fantastic character of this creation, the author 
provides for it a setting of the most unsparing real- 
ism, illustrated by photographic types of what passes

for humanity in modern London, made all the more 
vivid by touches of pungent satire, the representa- 
tives of actuality in both manners and speech. To 
the hero, this is all material for spiritual nurture, 
and his life blossoms as a water-lily from the bosom 
of a swamp. But no outline can do justice to this 
remarkable book. It puts for us in poignant modern 
terms some of the oldest of questions : What is 
reality ? What is the inner meaning of life ? What 
is the true path of the soul in its quest for happiness ? 
It would be too much to say that the questions are 
answered, but we may perhaps go so far as to say 
that the answers are broadly hinted at. Of this we 
are sure, that the book is one to love, and one that 
may act as a leaven upon the spirits that are not 
wholly stale, but are still capable of some sort or 
degree of fermentation. 

The moral of " The Avenger " appears to be that 
a man who resorts to blackmail, especially if a 
woman's reputation is at his mercy, puts himself 
without the pale of the law, and becomes a legitimate 
object of private vengeance. Assassination becomes 
a virtue in such a case, and is duly meted out to two 
blackmailers in Mr. Oppenheim's latest novel. The 
instrument of justice in this case is a retired army 
officer of the highest character, and we are given to 
understand that the author considers his conduct 
wholly praiseworthy. Since that is the point of view 
presented, we hardly see why the aforesaid officer 
should have committed suicide, which seems to be a 
weak concession to the bourgeois morality which the 
novelist scorns. Possibly, however, we are going far 
afield in seeking for a moral in a story so obviously 
designed for no higher purpose than that of sensa- 
tional entertainment. Considered as an invention 
merely, the story is neat and effective. The mystery 
is carefully guarded, and the factors which lead to 
its unravelling are introduced one at a time at dis- 
creet intervals. In the outcome it is cleared up, and 
there are no loose ends, unless we are still puzzled 
to know how the heroine got that latch-key, and why 
she turned so pale when told that the lawyer was on 
the track of the assassin. Construction is everything 
in such work as Mr. Oppenheim has chosen to do, 
and in this respect he is steadUy improving. 

Miss Elizabeth Ellis made her first appearance as 
a novelist, if we are not mistaken, about two years 
ago, when her story of " Barbara Winslow, Rebel " 
called our attention anew to the happenings of 
Monmouth Rebellion and the Bloody Circuit. It 
was an amateurish work, but an interesting one that 
showed marked signs of promise. That the signs 
were not misleading is made plainly evident by " The 
Fair Moon of Bath," now at hand. This is a tale 
of the Forty-five, that inexhaustible theme of roman- 
tic interest, and although it does nothing more than 
has been done a hundred times before, succeeds in 
holding our attention closely by its ingenious plot, 
its poetically-conceived love-interest, and its repro- 
duction (in the conventional manner, of course) of 
the speech and manners of English society in the 
days when Nash held sovereignty at Bath. The 



Jacobite Conspiracy is a tenuous affair, and comes 
to naught, but it supplies an exciting basis for what 
is essentially a story of private character and social 
concern. Miss Ellis is to be congratulated upon her 
success in dealing freshly with this well-worn theme. 
How Sally Snape, a child of the slums, becomes 
Miss Sarita Mainwaring, the idol of the music halls, 
and after that the happy wife of the still happier 
Lord Kidderminster, is circumstantially related in 
" The Heart of a Child." Green eyes, red hair, and 
a certain artless grace, seem to have been the causes 
of this soubrette's progress, as described by the lady 
who writes under the name of " Frank Danby." The 
heroine, we are told, preserves the childish heart in 
all her varied contacts with life, and this is why we 
are bidden to sympathize with " Kiddie's " infatua- 
tion. It is not a bad reason, and is made almost con- 
vincing by the mass of corroborative detail brought 
to bear upon its support. Sally (or Sarita) is cer- 
tainly represented to us as a most engaging person, 
and is, moreover, a very real figure, while her lover, 
who appears at first as a "Johnnie," grows into 
something quite like a man before we take leave of 
him. The author's realism, as exhibited in her earlier 
books, has often come near to being disgusting, but 
in the present instance, save for a few touches of vul- 
garity, it is realism of a good and honest sort. She 
has an amazingly minute and sympathetic knowledge 
of the sort of life she describes, and she uses it, for 
the most part, discreetly and effectively. The gutter, 
the shop, and the variety stage, all contribute to the 
effect, and the heroine moves amid this shifting en- 
vironment as a distinctly individual appearance, and 
as a human being whose character wins and holds 
our respect. William Morton Payne. 



Briefs on Books for Summer Reading. 

Two practical Mr. Herman B. Dorner, author of 
Tet^lT the little manual of "Window- 
gardener. Gardening" (Bobbs-MerrUl), is a 

teacher as well as a plant-grower, and his book is 
intended not only for the general public but for the 
school-room as well. The young folks are appealed 
to not by means of story but by practical advice in 
plain and simple language. The book is introduced 
by Professor Stanley Coulter of Purdue University, 
who emphasizes the value of nature-study in the 
school-room and the extent to which it may be de- 
veloped by the practice of window-gardening under 
the direction of teachers. An introductory chapter 
suggests the probable causes of failure in window- 
gardening. Following this are chapters on con- 
tainers, describing the advantages and uses of 
different kinds ; potting and re-potting, and trans- 
planting from the garden; soils, their types and 
conditions, with formulae for their preparation ; 
watering, the right and wrong ways, and the 
effects of too much or too little water ; fertilizers 
and their uses ; light, heat, and ventilation ; insect

enemies and their destruction ; propagation by seed, 
and the care of seedlings ; the propagation and care 
of cuttings ; the use of bulbs for forcing, with advice 
on the best kinds for this purpose ; foliage plants, 
including ferns ; and flowering plants. As the book 
is small and the type large, the descriptions and 
instructions are necessarily brief ; but for this very 
reason, perhaps, they gain in clearness. There is 
no extraneous matter, and for the inexperienced the 
little volume will be a real help. — Mr. Tarkington 
Baker's volume entitled " Yard and Garden " ( Bobbs- 
Merrill) claims to be '' a book of practical informa- 
tion for the amateur gardener in city, town, or 
suburb." It gives in plain language instructions that 
should enable the beginner to evolve an attractive 
garden out of any ground, even an ugly one. The 
author is no Philistine: he does not advise beds 
of " bedding-out " plants on the lawn. He is both 
artistic and sensible : he explains the effectiveness of 
mass-planting, of hiding the " bare feet " of a house, 
of the beauty of outside planting that is developed 
inward; and he cautions the amateur against the 
aimless curves of paths, against '' splotchiness " of 
effect, against trying to do too much at once. 
Indeed, one of his wisest bits of advice is the sug- 
gestion to begin the garden one year, with the larger 
and more permanent plantings ; leaving the fiUing-in 
and foregrounds for successive seasons, when it will 
be more readily seen just what is needed. This is 
not in opposition to the making of a permanent plan 
before beginning to plant, the necessity of which is 
recognized ; but the author holds that in this way 
the plan can be more effectively carried out, while 
at the same time modifications that suggest them- 
selves from time to time can be more easily adopted. 
There are seventeen chapters, covering the various 
subdivisions of the subject; and in some of these, 
as well as in the appendix, there are numerous 
reference-lists of plants, vines, and shrubs of dif- 
ferent classes and for varying purposes. The ap- 
pendix also includes outlines of several plans for 
planting city yards.

of London. i^^gjy ^ ^^^ writers of books. We 

have had accounts of its Bohemian resorts, of its 
storied Squares, of its " colour," as a young Japanese 
artist and a clever English essayist, between them, 
understand it. And now comes still another book, 
on " London Parks and Gardens " (Button), written 
by Mrs. Evelyn Cecil and lavishly illustrated in color 
and black-and-white by Lady Victoria Manners. Like 
everything else about the great city, the parks are 
imposing in extent and deeply dyed with historical 
and literary associations. Mrs. Cecil has something 
to say also about the botanical and decorative features 
of the parks, and more about their importance as 
green oases for the rest and recreation of the London 
poor ; but these matters are of far less interest, to 
American readers at least, than the memories of by- 



gone days, the bits of ancient gossip, the tales of 
brilliant assemblies and romantic meetings, that she 
has gathered. She groups the parks in five divi- 
sions : the Royal Parks, which are the largest and 
most beautiful, though not of the greatest use to the 
greatest number ; the municipal parks, thoroughly 
democratic, seldom very decorative, with their in- 
evitable band-stands, cricket-pitches, playgrounds, 
and beds of simple hardy flowers by way of orna- 
ment ; the gardens belonging to institutions, like the 
Charterhouse and the Inns of Court ; the Squares, 
most of them accessible only to the favored few who 
live on the streets surrounding them, but enjoyed 
from outside the railings by the larger public ; and, 
finally, a few notable private gardens that still sur- 
vive in spite of the smoke and over-crowding of the 
city. Mrs. Cecil considers the houses abutting on 
the Squares as within her province, and surely they 
are, since the quality of their inmates gave the tone, 
fashionable or the opposite, to each enclosure. She 
writes at length of the history and development of 
the parks, — the purchase of sites, dates of changes 
and improvements, and other such practical matters. 
The effect of so heterogeneous a mass of informa- 
tion is somewhat appalling taken en masse, but Mrs. 
Cecil's book is meant rather for reference. It con- 
tains everything one could reasonably wish to know 
on the subject, together with some details that seem 
unlikely to be of the slightest possible interest to 
anyone.

regions in all their varied aspects than formal guide- 
books. The text for the volume on Kent is furnished 
by Mr. Walter Jerrold, and the illustrations, in even 
more generous abundance than usual, by Mr. Hugh 
Thomson. In these latter, Mr. Thomson, being with- 
out the collaborator who has aided him in previous 
volumes of the series, departs from his usual manner 
and shows himself a delightful landscape artist, with 
the same appreciation for the essential picturesque- 
ness of scenery that he has for the essential oddities 
of humanity. There are charming little figures in 
his landscapes, but they are all subordinated to the 
general effect. — In the preface to his volume on 
Hampshire, Mr. D. H. Moutray Read says : "Hamp-

sweet scents, and bird melodies. This is only the 
said bundle with notes and impressions of many

is evidently true, as she says, that she and the 
breaker-in " have played the most fascinating of all 
games, the game of yachting, as seriously as if it 
were our life-work." But she soon discovered that 
no yachtsman believes that any of his fellows can 
" tell a canal-boat from a cup-defender," so she early 
took courage (this was while she was merely a yachts- 
man's affianced bride, on the way to promotion), and 
was the rather inducted into the enthusiasm that vivi- 
fies her work with a sweet reasonableness that quite 
belies the thought of any "breaking in." Her book tells 
a great deal that one wishei to know about yachts — 
enough, let us say, to enable a man insistently resi- 
dent on the western prairies to write an acceptable 
sea-story for the magazines ; but it is even more 
interesting in its mixture of the briny element with 
the moonlighton-the-water effects of early love. A 
voyager on many seas, and these as various as the 
differing shores of Venice and Cape Cod can make 
them, she and the faithful Stan, yachtsman-in-chief, 
were attended by more than one pair of lovers in 
differing stages of infection. All the world loves a 
lover, of course, though the treatment accorded them 
here is probably the one that endears them most to 
the reading public that likes to be amused ; for Mrs. 
Vorse's lovers are amusing. It is a pleasant book, 
flavored with more than one kind of salt. 



A beginner's Twenty years ago Mr. Garrett P. 
guide to the Serviss published his first book on 

starry sky. ^jjg gtarry heavens, entitled " Astron- 

omy with an Opera-Glass." His latest book is 
named " Astronomy with the Naked Eye" (Harper), 
and is in the main a g^ide to the study of the con- 
stellations. The author devotes his opening chapter 
to interesting the reader in the beauty of the starry 
sky. He then follows the familiar plan of describ- 
ing the most conspicuous constellations for each 
month of the year, in order. There are twelve 
two-page charts of constellations, showing not only 
the stars but also the mythological figures in light 
tracings made with orange-colored ink. These charts 
are intended to enable the reader to pick out the 
stars in each group, and to perceive their relation 
(where any exists) to the mythological figures. 
Mr. Serviss thereafter devotes his attention to his- 
torical and descriptive matter about the chief stars 
in each group, and succeeds in making his theme very 
interesting. Following the constellation chapters 
are four others, treating respectively of the Milky 
"Way, the Zodiacal light, the planets, and the moon. 
A possible improvement on this excellent handbook 



would be the addition of skeleton maps of the con- 
stellations, showing only the brighter stars, and 
connecting them by dotted lines ; these would be of 
decided assistance to the learner in finding on the 
face of the sky the marvellous objects which the 
author has described so well. 



Solitary Nearly twenty years ago Mr. Charles 

wanderings M. Doughty's account of his solitary 

in Arabia. wanderings through Central Arabia 

was published by the Cambridge Press, under the 
title "Travels in Arabia Deserta." The scientific 
world at once acknowledged its value as an authori- 
tative answer to many vexed questions of Arabian 
geography and of the life and history of the desert 
tribes ; but the great bulk and the costliness of 
the original edition stood in the way of a general 
recognition of its extraordinary merits as a literary 
masterpiece of travel. In order that it may be so 
recognized and enjoyed, Mr. Edward Garnett has 
prepared an abridgement of the original narrative, 
which, extending to a little more than half the orig- 
inal length, retains the personal chronicle, with its 
rare charm for the layman, and omits part of the 
vast store of detailed information on things Arabic, 
meant especially for the student or the traveller. The 
abridgment is entitled " Wandering^s in Arabia," 
and is published in two well-made volumes by the 
Messrs. Scribner. The peculiarity of Mr. Doughty's 
Arabian journeyings was that he went fearlessly 
among the fanatical Arabs, not only not concealing, 
but actually proclaiming, his race and his faith. His 
style has an oddly archaic flavor, but it is wonder- 
fully direct and trenchant, in fit correspondence 
with the incisive quality of his insight.

ledge of recent poetry, in the preparation of his book 
entitled " Wild Flower Families : The Haunts, Char- 
acters, and Family Relationships of the Herbaceous 
Wild Flowers, with Suggestions for their Identifi- 
cation " (Lippincott). As the fully descriptive title 
indicates, the treatment is by families, beginning 
with such flowers as appear earliest in spring and 
ending with those that longest defy the frosts of 
autumn. In each case, representative species and 
genera of each family are selected, generally with 
reference to the ease with which they may be found ; 
and as much information is imparted concerning 
them as will satisfy without surfeiting the curiosity 
of the average youthful mind. Photographs and 
printed descriptions go as far as possible toward 
identification without the over-use of technical terms, 
special attention being paid to times and places ; and 
the book always keeps in view the giving of practi- 
cal information, which is admirably blended with 
literary flavor through apt quotation, largely from 
contemporary poets.

A guide to the ^ complete and beautiful guide to 
mountain flora the flora of the Canadian Rockies 
of Canada. ^^^ Selkirks has recently been issued 

by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons in the volume 
entitled "Alpine Flora of the Canadian Rocky 
Mountains." Mr. Stewardson Brown, curator of the 
herbarium at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural 
Sciences, fxirnishes the text. Species are arranged 
in accordance with their scientific relationships, and 
there are keys to the genera, a general key to the 
families, a glossary, and an index to both common 
and scientific names. Seventy-nine full-page plates, 
about half of them in color, reproduce more than 
double that number of species, a great many of which 
have never been pictured before. Both water-color 
drawings and photographs are the work of Mrs. 
Charles S chaffer, who proves herself a botanical 
draughtsman of much ability. 



SOME RECENT GUIDE-BOOKS. 



The tourist who is plaiming a few weeks' or a few 
months' trip to Europe and means to avoid the vexatious 
baggage problem by " travelling light," cannot do better 
than fill a corner in his closely packed bag with Dr. 
Wilham J. Rolfe's « Satchel Guide to Europe " (Hough- 
ton). For a brief jotimey, particularly if it be also a 
first trip abroad, which necessarily keeps pretty closely 
to the beaten track, this little guide will be found entirely 
adequate. The 1908 edition, which has recently appeared, 
brings text and maps up to date. An outline of excur- 
sions in the Dolomite district has been added; also a 
sketch of a short tour through southern Spain. It is 
amazing how much information aboui; the entire toiu-ist 
region of Europe Dr. Rolfe has managed to crowd into 
the compass of a volume a trifle smaller than the average- 
sized " Baedeker." 

The Egyptian tourist season extends from October to 
May. Within that time, we are assured by the anony- 
mous author of the handy little guide " Egypt and How 
to See It " (Doubleday), one may possibly count ten 
days, in the worst years, that are not quite perfect. The 
distinctive feature of the new guide is the attractive 
colored illustrations done by Mr. A. O. Lamplough. The 
text is written in a style considerably less impersonal 
than that of the out-and-out guide-book, but it is sys- 
tematically arranged and there are outlines of tours of 
various lengths, an English-Arabic vocabulary, lists of 
hotels and banks, time-tables of the Egyptian State 
RaQway, and much other useful information for trav- 
ellers. And a traveller through Egypt everyone who 
looks at Mr. Lamplough's pictures will long to become. 

Mr. Frederick A. Ober's " Guide to the West Indies " 
(Dodd) includes, besides the matter covered by its title, 
an account of that more northerly g^up of islands, the 
Bermudas, and a glimpse of South America. Many 
illustrations will serve to whet the appetite of the hesi- 
tating tourist, and the excellent maps will assist him in 
planning his trip. As far as we know, this is the first 
comprehensive guide to the West Indies to be published. 
It describes the attractions, resources, climate, and his- 
tory of each island, gives a list of hotels and boarding- 
houses, with prices, and tells how to get to the various 
groups of islands from the United States, Canada, or 
Europe. 



A third edition of Karl Baedeker's " Handbook for 
Spain and Portugal " (Scribner) contains two additional 
maps and ten more plans, and brings all the information 
of the text up to date. As the second edition bore date 
of 1901, there has been ample chance for changes, par- 
ticularly in hotel and railway accommodations. Both, 
we are warned, are still poor, and in the case of hotels 
a deficiency in the supply for the accommodations of the 
increasing number of visitors has led to high charges. 
But the tourist who is willing to adapt himself to cir- 
cumstances can travel through Spain comfortably and 
at a cost not materially different from what he would 
spend elsewhere in Europe.

The thrilling story of the climax in the career of a young and beautiful girl who is a highly successful medium. The plot

stance when the plot is brought to its climax, make a really thrilling story, doubly interesting through the originality

romance shows the best work he has ever done.

COMPLETE, PROPORTIONED, EXCEPTIONALLY SIGNIFICANT 

A NEW WORK JUST READY 

By A. LAWRENCE LOWELL 

Professor of the Science of Government in Harvard University 

The Government of England 

In two volumes, cloth, 8vo. Price, $4.00; by mail, $4.36. 

Measured by standards of duration, absence of violent commotions, maintenance of law 
and order, general prosperity and contentment of the people, and by the extent of its 
influence on the institutions and political thought of other lands, the English gov- 
ernment has been one of the most remarkable the vv^orld has ever known. 

No one, least of all any American, can feel that her institutions are foreign to his interest; 
yet very few of them are thoroughly understood. Those which have been studied 
most have been considered without regard for proportion, or for their true relation 
to each other. Many of the forces at work have not been described in any treatise. 
They work below the surface and often escape students altogether. 

It was Mr. Bryce who in " The American Commonwealth " spread before our eyes like 
a map the whole system of our national existence, and made it fully comprehensible 
literally for the first time. Mr. Lowell in his own way renders, if possible, an 
almost greater service ; for he shows clearly and in proportion the complete picture 
of what we mean when we speak of " England." It is as if we had seen uncon- 
nected parts of a great painting ; never before has the whole been shown to us.

AN EDUCATIONAL SCANDAL. 



A great deal of education is being scattered 
about in these bustling days, and few young 
persons miss a share in the modern dispensation 
of knowledge. The supply is abundant, like 
that of the manna of fable, and it may seem 
ungrateful to question the quality of the food 
thus offered almost for the asking. But there 
are some curious-minded persons who cannot 
help inquiring if the food is really of the most 
nutritious and health-giving sort, and who can- 
not help comparing it with that which was dealt 
out (with far more sparing hand) to the youth 
of a past generation. It cost that generation an 
effort to get educated at all, and commensurate 
with the degree of the effort was the strength of 
the determination to get the best education that 
the accumulated wisdom of the ages could pro- 
vide. Education is now so much a matter of 
course, and is presented in such a variety of 
shapes, that we are in danger of forgetting the 
importance of a wise choice, and of taking with 
too little deliberation the kind that lies nearest 
(^o our reach. 

The following instructive story, which we 
assure our readers is not the invention of a 
humorist, but the report of an actual occurrence, 
provides a case in point. It was at a gathering 
of the alumni, old and young, of a famous col- 
lege. One of the older men spoke, and the 
burden of his discourse was to the effect that 
in his student days college men took a serious 
interest in literature and the humanities in gen- 
eral, an interest which did not seem to be shared 
with them by the students of the younger gener- 
ation. He said by way of illustration that it 
was not uncommon for a group of his fellow- 
students to go out for an afternoon walk, and 
spend most of their time in talking about Keats 
and Shelley. This speaker was followed by a 
representative of the younger generation — a 
graduate in engineering or something of the 
sort — who frankly admitted the truth of what 
had just been said, and added, for his own part, 
that he had never heard of " Sheats and Kelley." 
One cannot have much intercourse with the 
yoimg college graduates of to-day without com- 
ing to realize that there are many in similar

out into life with the academic stamp upon them, 
duly documented as educated men, yet lacking 
in the very elements of an education in any 
liberal sense. They may have the formulas of 
the electrician upon their tongue's end, but the 
simplest allusion to literature finds them blankly 
unresponsive ; nay, they may even be prepared 
to settle the business of a new Hoti^ and yet 
know nothing of the spiritual message of 
^schylus or of Plato. 

The steadily increasing ignorance, on the part 
of our young college men, of matters absolutely 
essential to any kind of education that deserves 
to be called liberal, is nothing less than an edu- 
cational scandal. Professor Wilbur L. Cross of 
Yale has just given us a striking illustration of 
that ignorance in the case of the English Bible. 
" Not long ago," he says, " to recall an extreme 
case, not one of forty students under my instruc- 
tion coidd quite place Judas Iscariot ; and a 
venerable colleague of mine discovered a Jew 
among the seniors who had never heard of 
Moses." We have had much other testimony 
to similar effect of late years, and it seems fairly 
evident that the Bible, which is perhaps the 
greatest single source of liberal culture for 
English readers, has become a sealed book to a 
large fraction of the present generation. The 
Greek and Latin classics are in like case, and 
the best part of English literature is fast grow- 
ing unintelligible even to those of our young 
readers who have enjoyed what are euphemisti- 
cally called educational advantages. Upon this 
point we may quote Professor Grant Showerman 
of Wisconsin, who informs us of students who 
have told him that 

" The Centaurs and ChinMeras were German tribes 
conquered by Augustus, called Dolabella the goddess 
of peace, Aristides the goddess of the ' chace,' Andro- 
mache a Greek hero at Troy, Astyanax an island ' some- 
where in the Mediterranean,' and defined 'Soraotus' 
as an intimate friend of Horace to whom he expounded 
the carpe diem idea. According to one of them, ' Pil- 
grim's Progress ' was ' one of the sources of New 
England history.' A single set of examination papers 
yielded the edifying information that Penelope was the 
Muse of history, the wife of Achilles, the Trojan Helen 
stolen by Agamemnon, the goddess of wine, mirth, and 
the like, the mother of Proserpine, one of the Muses 
who presided over lyric poetry, and a kind of wine-jar." 

We should be inclined to say that many stu- 
dents nowadays get from their college life little 
but educational disadvantages. They are advised 
that " sociology " is as good as history, and take 
to it greedily ; they learn French through the 
medium of trivial fiction, and never hear of 
Bossuet and Racine ; they absorb themselves in 



science, and get no realizing sense of the exist- 
ence of such a thing as art. 

It is not alone the classics and the Scriptures 
that suffer neglect, it is pretty nearly everything 
that is deeply significant for human culture. 
Just the other day we casually read on one page 
of a periodical written for educated readers that 
" the public will not borrow Gargantua's mouth 
for things of a past generation," and on the next 
page that " the Republic has no need of chem- 
ists ; nor, it seems, the Church of scholars." 
The two allusions set us to thinking ; for besides 
their obvious lesson, they put before us the 
question : How large a percentage of the recent 
graduates of any of our colleges would be likely 
to understand them ? There is nothing recon- 
dite about either of them ; yet we have a dark 
suspicion that neither the name of Rabelais 
nor that of Lavoisier has any associations at 
all for the average modern man who has been 
through the coUege mill and received the acad- 
emic certification that comes at the end of the 



course. 



The melancholy exhibits which have just been 
presented might be multiplied indefinitely — 
far beyond the point at which they would still 
be capable of raising even a smile. Where 
shall the responsibility for them be fixed ? We 
doubt if it is to be fixed at all in any very defi- 
nite way. Certainly it would be unjust to 
charge it all to the account of the colleges. 
They do about the best they can with the plas- 
tic material placed in their hands for moulding, 
and should rest under no severer indictment 
than that of fostering a confused sense of values, 
and conducting an educational scheme in which 
there are far too many loose ends. The lower 
schools come in for some share of the censure, 
and the parents for some further share. But 
the evil must in large measure be ascribed to 
the general conditions of American life, to the 
ideals which are in the air, to the prevailing 
incentive of commercialism, and to the countless 
influences that encourage the frivolous disposi- 
tions of the young and discourage the develop- 
ment of their serious aptitudes. Against the 
pressure of the spiritually-enervating environ- 
ment to which our youth is almost everywhere 
exposed, it is little more than a vain resistance 
that may be offered by the school or the college. 
The young, man joins in the game, and plays it 
with zest, but the cards are stacked against him, 
and he loses steadUy without discovering the 
reason until it is too late for him to recoup. 
The moral of it all seems to be that our mod- 
ern society has thought to relieve itself of 



1908.]

educational responsibility by multiplying the 
mere machinery of education, forgetting the 
all-important fact that the ordering of the daily 
life, most of which is spent perforce outside of 
academic walls, is the controlling faxitor in the 
shaping of intellect and character alike. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Vacation-planning by book and time-table may 
seem a rather cold-blooded performance, likely to take 
much of the zest and charm from one's summer holiday 
at the very start. In vacation time all trammels are 
irksome — • at least until one is old enough to have learned 
that one's own unregulated impulses and whims are the 
worst of tyrants. At this season of the year many 
public libraries make a point of placing on open shelves 
and tables a collection of railway guides, summer-resort 
booklets, books on camping, canoeing, fishing, and itin- 
eraries of various kinds, so that their patrons may intel- 
ligently plan their summer outings. The current issue 
of the " Bulletin of the Grand Rapids Public Library " 
calls attention to its display of such material, and those 
whose wanderlust is willing to be regulated and controlled 
will profit by a visit to the library, if it lies within their 
reach. And not only can they learn where to go for 
their vacation, but also, if they are young enough to be 
able stiU to profit by such advice, they can learn at 
the same library where to go to school or college or 
university when their vacation is over; for we read in 
the same issue of the Bulletin that " the Library has 
gathered a very large collection of school and college 
catalogues and other literature which will help to solve 
this question." What human needs, we wonder as we 
read of the manifold activities of the libraries of our 
broad land, will these beneficent institutions ere long not 
be able to meet ? ... 

Graduate schools for literary workers have 
been proposed and much written about and talked about 
of late. Foremost among the favorers of such schools 
is the energetic and enterprising editor of " The World's 
Work," who appears to be seriously in earnest in urging 
that the cause of creative literature can be served by 
placing our would-be great authors on a bench in a 
class-room and putting them through a prescribed course 
of studies and exercises and lectures and examinations. 
But, says one who evidently knows whereof he speaks, 
those who every year come from the remoter corners of 
our country to take post-graduate courses in the great 
universities, ardently seeking after the best that has 
been thought and said in the world, "are bidden to 
provide themselves with an adding machine to count 
the occurrence of ' fish ' and ' flesh ' in the poetry of the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; they are asked to 
hearken to the vowels and consonants singing together 
through the Dark Ages ; they are invited to embrace the 
inspiring relics of the Gothic gospels ; they are inducted 
into the physiology of the vocal organs; they are set 
astride an enchanted booomstick and sent chasing 
Cuchulinn through the Celtic moonshine. Seriously, 
there is nothing more pathetic in the world than the 
sight of the ardent and aspiring souls from Utah, Oregon, 
Texas, and the isles of the sea, who come up to the 
graduate schools, and, in the faith and heart-ravishing 



impudence of little children asking for bread, receive a 
gold brick. So much for enlarging their acquaintance 
with great men and great ideas." Whether a school for 
authorship, a seminary for literary inspiration, could be 
planned and conducted with less disappointing results 
than the graduate courses above referred to, is a ques- 
tion. Perhaps a thoughtful reading of Stevenson's 
" Apology for Idlers " might help one to an answer. 
Meanwhile, let us ask, can we by any stretch of the 
imagination think of our great creative authors as hav- 
ing fitted themselves for their work in a graduate 
school ? Would any number of years in such a school 
have inspired Poe to write " The Raven," or Whitman 
" Leaves of Grass," or Mark Twain " The Adventures 
of Huckleberry Finn," or Bret Harte " The Luck of 
Roaring Camp " ? How to express oneself correctly is 
a matter of elementary education ; but creative authors 
are bom, not made in graduate schools.

The function of the literary journal is vari- 
ously conceived. Some think it is to promote the 
reading of the best that is written in the world to-day; 
and others say it is to serve as the busy man's short-cut 
to a knowledge of what the teeming presses are produc- 
ing, and to save him the time and trouble of reading 
the books themselves. A literary journalist's notion of 
the matter is well given in a passage from Mr. Frederic 
C. Brown's recent address at Atlantic City on " Literary 
Journalism in Theory and Practice." " The literary 
journal, in a quiet way," he believes, " is influencing the 
people who think. Many centuries ago Plato showed 
us how, by a process of percolation, profound results of 
the thinkers ultimately descend upon the non-thinkers. 
Is it not fair to maintain, then, that lacking so much 
that goes to make up commercial success, the literary 
journal, by revising and shaping and helpmg the scholas- 
tic life of America, is going a long way toward that 
intellectualism which is the salvation of any people ? 
Moreover, if the literary journal stand without much 
financial gain and without blatant success to urge it on 
a yellow way, and yet manages somehow and somewhere 
to rebuke the impatience of modern, rushing commer- 
cialism, is it not, after all, well worth while ? "

The evolution of " The Metropolis " must be of 
interest to many out of the thousands now reading and 
discussing Mr. Upton Sinclair's latest sensation. In an 
open letter he relates the many opportunities he has had 
for acquainting himself with the ways of the worshippers 
of mammon. His early associations and later experience 
seem to have qualified him to make his picture true to 
life, without resorting to any of the questionable methods 
that some of his critics have assumed, and without grind- 
ing his colors in the mill of his own mind, as others have 
charged him with doing. He says, among much else of 
an autobiographic nature : " I had, of course, many oppor- 
tunities of getting into touch with social life in under- 
ground ways [some of which are described]. ... I 
chose a much more obvious way of getting my material, 
so obvious, perhaps, that few would have thought of it. 
I sat down and wrote personal letters to the people I 
wished to meet. I told them frankly just what I intended 
to do, and I said that I should like to make their acquaint- 
ance. I said that I had talked with many people in get- 
ting material for my work, and that I had never violated 
a confidence, nor dropped the remotest hint as to the 
source of my information. I said that I would like to 
meet them privately and explain my purposes to them.

In about three-fourths of the cases the result of this 
was that I met the person I wanted to meet." Refuting 
the charge that his pictures of club life have been taken 
from the caf^s, he says : " I have lived in New York City 
off and on for eighteen years, and in that time I have 
been in just exactly one caf^. I do not know the taste 
of liquor, and I have never smoked tobacco, nor even 
drimk a cup of coffee. Living as a solitary student and 
hack-writer in lodging house garrets, I have been in and 
out and around the Tenderloin a good deal, but I never 
even realized what it was until a couple of years ago, 
when I began my study of the life of New York. . . . 
As to the clubs, I have at various times been a guest of 
the Authors, the Players, the Century, the Union League, 
the Lotos, and the Metropolitan." In reply to the charge 
of having incorporated newspaper yarns in his novel, he 
admits that " several of these items were gathered from 
newspapers, but so far as 95 per cent of the contents of 
the book is concerned, it has come directly from the lips 
of persons who themselves have taken part in what they 
described, and I should say that 60 per cent of it I have 
seen with my own eyes." Mr. Sinclair has even sat down 
to a " tospy-turvy limch " — not in a Long Island road- 
house, however, but near New Rochelle.

The comparative greatness of Goethe and 
Shakespeare in tragedy can hardly be discussed 
without noticing how completely Goethe was saturated 
with the works of his predecessor. He took lago from 
one play, and the worst part of Hamlet's character from 
another. He borrowed Opheha bodily. Has it ever 
been noted how closely Marguerite follows the pattern 
of Ophelia ? Each is a comparatively humble maiden 
wooed by a superior. There is the possible seduction 
in Hamlet and the certain one in Faust. Ophelia's sug- 
gestive mad-song is echoed in Faust. The two girls are 
sisters in modesty, gentleness, and submissive worship 
of their lovers. To both come madness and death. 
Goethe lifted his Witches' Kitchen from Macbeth, and 
the Walpurgis Night is at least suggestive of the 
Midsummer Night's Dream. Auerbach's Cellar is 
reminiscent of the Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap ; and 
Dame Martha might have been studied from Mrs. 
Quickly or Juliet's Nurse. All this does not exhaust 
the tale of Goethe's borrowings. To Marlowe he was 
indebted for the whole idea of his work ; and the first 
scene of Faust in his study, particularly the opening 
soliloquy, is full of the English poet. The Helena 
theme of the second part also came from him. From 
Calderon's Magico Prodigioso, Goethe absorbed a great 
deal. From the Hindoo drama in general and Sakun- 
tala in particular he took the idea of the Theatre 
Prologue. And from the Book of Job he got the 
Prologue in Heaven. Truly, a splendid assortment of 
borrowed trappings. Yet the originality of Faust is 
unquestionable, and it holds up its head among its 
fellows in literature in spite of the fact that it owes 
something to almost all of them.

The " BiBLioSMiLES," a merry offshoot of the serious 
and dignified American Library Association, receive a 
sort of official recognition in the current report of the 
Los Angeles Public Library. " This annual," says the 
librarian. Dr. Charles F. Lummis, " has none of the 
exigencies of journalism; but it would be a pity for it to 
lose a ' scoop ' ready to its hand — since no other library 
report this year will contain the serious information that 



at the twenty-ninth Annual Conference of the American 
Library Association that grave and reverend body en- 
joyed an unexpected parthenogenesis (vide Isaiah ix., 6). 
This mild protest against the solemnity into which the 
profession has fallen — its tendency to ' forget that we 
are, after all, mere retailers of Tinned Humanity . . . 
and that the books we pass out belong, after all, to the 
Public, and not to us ' — is christened ' the Bibliosmiles, 
a rally of Librarians who are Nevertheless Human.' Its 
object is ' to keep the bookdiist off our own top shelves.' 
Membership is limited to thirty. All the official insignia 
of fraternalism are provided for. There will be annual 
meetings at the conference of the A. L. A. The motto 
of the order is (Virgil to date) « Homo Sum — and Then 
Some.' " But just why the birth of this interesting off- 
spring of grave and reverend parentage is called a 
" parthenogenesis " rather than, for example (if we may 
coin the word), a " gerontogenesis," is somewhat less 
clear than crystal, even with Isaiah to sharpen one's 
vision. .* , , 

This brief span of life seems, by a curious con- 
tradiction, the briefer the older we grow. "Even at 
eighty-nine," said Mrs. Julia Ward Howe on her next- 
to-ninetieth birthday celebration last month, " individual 
life is very short. We cannot do too much in the time 
we have. At my age one spends much time in remin- 
iscences. When I remember the events of fifty and 
sixty years ago, the cold welcome given those who cham- 
pioned the cause of anti-slavery and of woman's suffrage, 
how they were elbowed out of the way — when I 
remember that, and then see these very things adopted 
in the ordinary programme of progress, I think life is 
miraculous. I have learned that much about it, if 
nothing else. This is a time of great light and progress. 
Things that sixty years ago only philosophers and saints 
dreamed of, we, who are neither philosophers nor saints, 
talk about calmly to-day." This was at a luncheon 
tendered her by the New England Woman's Club, of 
which she is president. With the eager attention of 
nineteen rather than eighty-nine, she listened to all the 
speeches, gayly applauded the witticisms, and acknowl- 
edged each tribute of praise with a gracious bow. 
Heartily she joined in the singing of " Auld Lang 
Syne," and hers was the first voice to start the second 
stanza. Thus she is pictured to us by one who was 
present. Her closing words, which met with emphatic 
dissent from her assembled friends, were these : " I take 
a good bit off the corner of all these fine things I 've 
heard about myself. I 'm sorry to say, ladies and 
gentlemen," shaking her head sadly, "that I know 
better." ... 

Qualifications for successful journalism are 
acknowledged to be many and varied, but a new one is 
rather amusingly emphasized in a Baltimore editor's 
free and easy reply to a North Carolina aspirant to 
journalistic honors. " A good literary style," writes the 
experienced newspaper man, "is less essential than a 
good digestion. The journalist must be able to digest 
anything and nothing. He must be able to go three 
days without food. . . . The accidents and catastrophes 
which make up the news of the world have no regular 
office-hours. They happen at any old time, day or 
night. When they break loose the journalist must pro- 
ceed to record them, and he must stick to the task imtil 
they are recorded. As a result he must learn to stretch 
the hiatus between lunch and dinner until it attains 
the dignity of a geological epoch." As to rapidity of

promotion and the time required for reaching the top 
of the ladder, this painfully conscientious editor says : 
"The question has interested us very much, and we 
have lain awake several nights figuring upon an answer. 
Working it out carefully after consulting more than 
2,000 journalists and with the aid of the table of 
logarithms, the United States census reports for the 
period 1820-1900, and all available dream books, we 
have settled upon 265.7645364827 years. We may be 
wrong about the decimals, but the 265, we are sure, is 
reasonably correct." The higher positions in journalism 
are well known to be filled by men unreasonably averse 
to dying or resigning, but their tenacity of office and of 
life has never been so startlingly revealed as it is by an 
intelligent study of the foregoing figures.

The wireless way op typesetting, if what we 
hear is true, may relieve the present linotype operator 
of a part of his burden. Mr. Hans Knudsen, the 
Danish inventor, after achieving fame in liquid air, 
now proposes to add to his glory by his mastery of the 
properties of non-liquefied air. Or, to be more specific, 
by means of electric waves generated in the atmosphere 
by methods known to wireless telegraph experts, he 
declares himself able to set type in an ordinary linotype 
machine in Paris (let us say), the inventor himself being 
in London. " I shall publicly demonstrate my new wire- 
less typesetting invention," is the Dane's interesting 
announcement (as reported in the press), " within a few 
weeks. I have already had the first machine con- 
structed, and it proved successful, setting three thou- 
sand words an hour, at a distance, just as if the operator 
were working the machine. The time is not far distant 
when, with my invention, the London correspondents of 
the New York newspapers will be able to send their 
news straight to the printing press through the Mar- 
coni operator." And perhaps more astonishing still: 
" I claim I can send pictures wherever Marconi can 
send messages. Within a short time I shall be sending 
pictures of criminals and finger prints from England to 
New York." Puck's putting a girdle romid the earth 
in forty minutes has long since come to be regarded as 
the work of a bungler; but now that Mr. Knudsen is 
going to put an illustrated newspaper (will it be illus- 
trated in colors, we wonder ?) from London to New York 
in the twinkling of an eye, poor Puck will wish the 
fertile brain of his creator had never given him birth.

Mr. John Murray and the London " Times " 
have been enjoying a little legal tilt in the King's Bench 
Division of the High Com^t of Justice, before Mr. Justice 
Darling and a special jury, and the publisher has won 
(to the extent of £7500 damages) from the newspaper. 
This litigation, which may be regarded as a closing skir- 
mish in the great " book war " whose cannon-thunders 
have echoed round the world, owes its cause to a London 
" Times " letter, signed " Artifex," which charged Mr. 
Murray with practising extortion in placing so high a 
price (£3 3s.) on the Queen Victoria Letters. The quar- 
rel is little more edifying than are most libel suits, but 
its peculiarity and its special significance to both sellers 
and buyers of books make it deserving of at least a pass- 
ing note. As Mr. Justice Darling said in his summing 
up of the evidence, — "It is a very unusual action in 
many respects, particularly becaiise of the parties to it. 
It is not too much to say that The Times and the house 
of Murray are practically institutions of the country. I 
cannot help feeling that so far from its being an action 



of a commonplace nature, such as one hears tried every 
day, it is much as if it were a quarrel between Magna 
Charta and the Bill of Rights." To a distant and im- 
partial on-looker, unendowed with legal acumen, the 
whole affair presents itself in a very plain Ught. The 
Letters of Queen Victoria, interesting though they may 
be to the English public, are not a necessary of life ; and 
if their authorized publisher chooses to put a handsome 
price on them, the poor man may regret it, but, not being 
under the slightest compulsion to buy, it is absurd for 
him to cry out, as did Artifex, " Now, sir, these figures 
. . . spell simple extortion." The figures spell more than 
most of us like to spend on even a queen's correspondence ; 
but to say that our pockets have been wrung is a misuse 
of language. ... 

The function of the library bulletin is well 
conceived and aptly expressed in the initial number of 
" The Library Guide," an attractive little periodical 
issued by the Aurora (111.) Public Library. " Compara- 
tively few," says the editor (whom we safely assume to 
be Mr. James Shaw, the librarian), " know the extent of 
the riches contained even in a small library. A remark 
we frequently hear is, ' Why, I did not know you had 
that book in the library.' Hundreds of books are on the 
shelves, equally imknown to the general reader, books 
possessing vitality and interest, whose pages have power 
to touch life deeply, to brighten, beautify, and broaden 
it, to make it more enjoyable as well as more useful." 
The aim proposed by the Aurora " Guide " is to make 
more widely known, and more often and more intelli- 
gently read, the books bought and to be bought and 
undeserving of the dust and repose to which so many 
accessions are condemned by a too incurious public. The 
explanatory comments sprinkled through the " List of 
New Books " are brief and to the point, and other 
matter, including a picture of the well-filled Children's 
Room, contributes to the interest of this promising 
publication. ... 

The French novel in France would almost seem to 
be in less demand than abroad. A Paris correspondent 
of the New York " Evening Post " finds reason to believe 
that " there must be in France a relatively larger num- 
ber of readers of books which are not novels, for cer- 
tainly the predominance of fiction during the publishing 
season is not so great in Paris as in London or New 
York." It has long been deeply regretted, by those 
concerned for the fair fame of French writers, that the 
yellow-covered novel of a certain familiar type shoidd 
be so much demanded by non-French readers, and that 
French literature as a whole should be so thoughtlessly 
and unjustly judged and condemned by alien censors 
whose knowledge of that literature extends, perhaps, not 
further than a second-hand impression of the inferior 
fiction manufactured (it may be) for export. 
... 

Historic Winchester's new library building 
had its corner-stone laid on the 28th of May. We refer 
to Winchester, Virginia, and to the fine Handley Library, 
the gift of the late Judge John Handley, that is soon to 
adorn that city. It is reported that $200,000 will be 
expended in erecting the building, and that it will be 
" one of the handsomest edifices in the State." It is 
with unusual satisfaction that we note this evidence of 
library activity in one of our Southern states. If in the 
past less than justice has been done to that part of our 
broad land, in these occasional comments on library mat- 
ters, it is pleasant to hail this sympton of a literary re- 
awakening in the Old Dominion.

" A Perfect Woman. Nobly Pl,anmei>."* 



A more sympathetic and satisfying portrayal 
of a beautiful character could not be imagined 
than Professor Palmer's " Life of Alice Freeman 
Palmer." Fifteen years of happy married life, 
following and continuing a friendship that had 
ripened during Alice Freeman's presidency of 
Wellesley, brought the two into so close an 
intimacy, without naerging their separate individ- 
ualities, that no better equipped biographer could 
have been desired for this wonderfully interest- 
ing and brilliant woman whose untimely death 
was so great a loss to her countless friends and 
admirers and to the noble causes she so valiantly 
championed. But though her life was compara- 
tively short, covering as it did less than half a 
century, the work of that life cannot be said to 
have been left unfinished at her death. So alive 
was Mrs. Palmer, while she did live, that her 
achievement, even when at thirty-two she relin- 
quished her college presidency, was something 
astonishing. What quality it was in her that 
made possible so speedy attainment of great ends 
must remain a mystery ; hers was a nature that 
had in large proportion the baffling element of 
genius. Her biographer himself says in his 
Introduction : 

" I cannot explain it. Probably genius is never expli- 
cable. The more nearly it is examined, the more intri- 
cately marvellous it appears. Fifteen years of closest 
companionship with Mrs. Palmer did not disclose to me 
the pulse of that curious machine. She always remained 
a surprise. Yet I never tired of studying her; for 
though we seldom can fully comprehend a person, in 
studying one who is great we can push analysis farther 
than elsewhere and with larger entertainment and pro- 
fit ; we discover a multitude of ingredients unsuspected 
at first; and, most interesting of all, we come upon 
strange modes of turning trivial things to power and of 
gaily discarding what men usually count important. And 
even when at last we arrive at what defies analysis, being 
the very individuality itself, its beautiful mystery still 
lures us on and — like Keats's Grecian Urn — enlargingly 
' teases us out of thought.' " 

The rich and beneficent life of this woman 
falls into four chief divisions, in the biog- 
rapher's treatment of it : first, what he calls her 
family life, from her birth in 1855 at Colesvjlle, 
Broome County, N. Y., to her entering Windsor 
Academy in 1865 ; second, the expansion of her 
powers, up to her graduation from Michigan 
University in 1876 ; third, her service to others, 
extending to her marriage in 1887 ; and last, 
the expression of herself, ending with her death

in 1902. These four periods, while not exclu- 
sive of one another, are dominated each by 
special interests that are roughly indicated by 
the four designations chosen by the biographer. 
Externally, the early life is limited by conditions 
that may be regarded as commonplace enough ; 
but it is not our opportunities, it is the use we 
make of them that counts. Alice Freeman took 
her life in her own hands, and, with restricted 
means and a rather frail physique to contend 
against, shaped it into a thing of beauty and of 
power. Characteristic of her was her early de- 
termination, in the face of much opposition, to go 
to college — in the days when college education 
for girls was an experiment frowned upon by the 
majority. Her choice of far-away Ann Arbor, 
becavise there she could have the same instruc- 
tion and receive the same degree as male stu- 
dents, shows the stuff she was made of. 

In this connection her views on co-education 
are of interest. While President Hall and 
other educators, are fearing a feminization of 
schoolboys and coUege youths, and are demand- 
ing more exclusively male influences both in the 
teacher's chair and in the student associates, 
Mrs. Palmer continued to the end a firm be- 
liever in co-education. In her opinion, says her 
husband, the natural association of girls with 
boys in interests of a noble sort tends to broaden 
their vision, to solidify their minds, and to 
remove much that is hectic and unwholesome 
from the awakening instincts of sex. In the 
words of Professor Hale of Chicago, as quoted 
by the biographer, " It was Mrs. Palmer's con- 
viction that the normal form of education for 
both sexes is that in which the natural relations 
— begun in the life of the home and the neigh- 
borhood, continued for the great majority in the 
life of the school, and inevitably existing in the. 
later social life — are carried without break 
through the four years of higher intellectual 
work. She may have been right or she may have 
been wrong ; but that such a woman, with her 
personal experience of Ann Arbor, of Wellesley, 
of Radcliffe, and of Harvard, should have held 
this belief is a fact to be reckoned with." 

In the things of religion, no less than in those of 
education, Mrs. Palmer always thought for her- 
self. H§r faith was of the orthodox complexion, 
but she held it not as a mere matter of conven- 
tion, but from personal conviction. A paragraph 
from a college letter to her mother illustrates 
this side of her character. The letter was writ- 
ten in a moment of considerable perplexity, 
when lack of money was about to force the 
writer to discontinue for a while her course at

Ann Arbor and undertake the principalship of 
the high school at Ottawa, Illinois. This step 
she took without consulting her parents, though 
she was not twenty years old at the time. 

" If you can help me through this year I will try as 
best I may to take up the paddle and push my own canoe 
afterwards. Whatever comes, dear mother, I know is 
best for me. It is all right. Still, I believe God helps 
only those who help themselves. I shall try to do my 
part, and I fully expect He will do the rest. ... So I 
am waiting and trusting and working just as hard as I 
can while the day lasts. Do n't make yourself unhappy 
nor let any of the rest do so. Why should you when 
He has said, ' Seek first the kingdom of God and all things 
shall be added.' If our Father wants me to go through 
college, I know I shall go ; and if He does n't, I do n't want 
to. That is the end of it. Meanwhile I am planning and 
thinking. If it comes to anything, I will report." 

The personal influence — or magnetism, as 
some would call it — of this gifted and forceful 
woman must be made to explain many of her 
marveUous achievements. When, at the age of 
twenty-six, she was appointed acting president of 
WeUesley College — an appointment that led 
naturally to the presidency in the following 
year — she was in doubt whether her young 
shoulders could bear so heavy a burden. Her 
final action shows her compelling influence on 
others and her quick resourcefulness. The story 
is best told in the words of the book. 

" I have ah-eady shown the necessarily disturbed con- 
dition of the college in these early years. There were 
now fears of trouble from the more than usually ani- 
mated senior class. They had intimations of the election 
almost as soon as Miss Freeman learned it herself, and 
were much elated over the prospect of being ruled by a 
president but little older than themselves. When Miss 
Freeman returned to her rooms, she sent for this class. 
They came in a body, filling with their merry presence 
all her chairs, tables, and floor. She told them she had 
called them together because she needed their advice. 
She had been asked that day to become acting president 
of Wellesley. She was too young for the office. Indeed, 
its duties were too heavy for anyone. If she must meet 
them alone, she would have to decUne. But it had oc- 
curred to her that perhaps they would be willing to take 
part with her, looking after the order of the college them- 
selves, and leaving her free for general administration. 
If they were ready to imdertake this, she thought she 
might accept. Of course the response was hearty. They 
voted themselves her assistants on the spot, and difficult 
indeed it was for any member of the three lower classes 
to stray from the straight path that year." 

The various useful activities into which Mrs. 
Palmer threw herself after her marriage and her 
settlement in Cambridge — her service on the 
Massachusetts Board of Education, her presi- 
dency of the Woman's Education Association, 
of the Woman's Home Missionary Association, 
and of other like bodies, her work as non-resident 
Dean of Women at Chicago University, where 
she contrived to spend a few weeks each year, 



her part in organizing the great World's Colum- 
bian Exposition, and her share in other works 
of philanthropy too numerous to mention — 
are matters of recent history and need not be 
dwelt on here. As a pleasing picture of her in 
her happy comradeship with her husband, let 
us quote a passage referring to their favorite 
method of touring Europe together in the 
" sabbatical years " that gave variety to their 
iiniversity life. 

" The sport of bicycling suited Mrs. Palmer's passion 
for independence as did little else. Ready as her sym- 
pathies regularly were, she was no less ready, when the 
burden of the world became oppressive, to throw them 
all aside. Then she would renew herself in utter free- 
dom and isolation, afterwards coming forth ardently 
social again. In her the child and the responsible 
woman were ever amusingly combined. It was the 
former that steered when she sat on her bicycle. At 
the call of the white road she felt all ties to be cut. 
The world was all before her where to choose. She 
could turn to the right or left, could feel the down- 
pressed pedal and the rushing air, could lie in the shade 
by the roadside, visit a castle, dally long at luncheon, 
gather grapes or blackberries from the field, stop at 
whatever small inn might attract at night, and for days 
together commune rather with nature than with man. 
To preserve the fullest sense of independence, we sent 
forward no trunk to meet us at appointed spots, but 
designed a soft bag for the bicycle which would hold 
supplies for three weeks. We made our nights long, 
beginning to ride about half-past nine in the morning 
and ending in time for the bath and rest before dinner. 
We rode slowly, avoiding records of more than forty 
miles a day, and dismoimting at every colorable excuse; 
our rule for hills being that wherever a horse should 
walk, we would." 

The letters and unpublished poems of Mrs. 
Palmer are drawn upon to complete the picture 
of her life and mind, her temperament and 
sympathies. A set of verses entitled " The 
Butterfly " — some of its lines suggestive of 
Tennyson, and perhaps not unworthy of him — 
is especially pleasing. 

" I hold you at last in my hand, 
Exquisite chUd of the air. 
Can I ever understand 

How you grew to be so fair ? 

" You came to my linden tree 
To taste its delicious sweet, 
I sitting here in the shadow and shine 
Playing around my feet. 

" Now I hold you fast in my hand. 
You marvellous butterfly, 
Till you help me to understand 
The eternal mystery. 

" From that creeping thing in the dust 
To this shining bliss in the blue ! 
God give me courage to trust 
I can break my chrysalis too ! " 

That the writer of these verses could have made

a name for herself in literature, had she so 
desired, cannot be doubted ; but when her hus- 
band remonstrated with her for building no 
literary monument to her memory, and added, 
" When you are gone people will ask who you 
were, and nobody will be able to say," she 
replied : " Well, why should they say ? I am 
trying to make girls wiser and happier. Books 
do n't help much toward that. They are enter- 
taining enough, but really dead things. Why 
should I make more of them ? It is people that 
count. You want to put yourself into people ; 
they touch other people ; these, others still, and 
so you go on working forever." So little thirst 
had she for posthumous fame. 

The chief value to us now of Mrs. Palmer's 
life, and of her husband's record of it, lies in 
the renewed sense it imparts of the richness and 
worth of this our mortal existence — of the end- 
less opportunities that lie ever open to us if we 
will but shake off our sloth and our bondage to 
convention. Laziness and conventionality Mrs. 
Palmer hated above all else, and she early 
became convinced that most people are only half- 
awake. In the diffidence and self -searching with 
which Professor Palmer has approached the task 
of preparing a biography, in any degree satis- 
factory, of his eminently gifted wife, we read at 
the outset fair promise of success in his difficult 
undertaking ; and we close the book feeling that 
no one could better have discharged this debt 
of love. It is a biography of unusual interest 
just now, and it is safe to predict that it will 
interest future generations of readers to whom 
Alice Freeman Palmer's name may be unknown. 
It has a human appeal and a literary charm and 
finish that combine to make it almost an ideal 
book of its kind. Percy F. Bicknell.

Readers of Maeterlinck will recognize the dazed 
loving cry of Selysette, who is trying to do her 
part in a superhuman effort of three characters 
to convince themselves that the perfect triangle 
of love may include three right angles ; and this 
mingling of bewilderment and struggle is not 
far from the mood begotten in many of us by 
our first contact with Symbolism. We felt 
that it was an attempt to evade " the old bond-

age of rhetoric, the old bondage of exteriority," 
to substitute the language of the spirit for the 
language of the flesh ; that it was a call to the 
soul long starved on the husks of mat(}rialism or 
confined in the mud-walled prisons of extreme 
realism ; that it was a recognition of mystery 
and a yearning for the infinite. It was there- 
fore our duty to understand. But what did it 
all mean? Blind faces huddled together and 
half seen through grudging windows ; a child 
weeping in a lonely tower on a dreary strand ; 
a sister sobbing with arms outstretched toward 
a relentless door, while her idolized brother is 
pitilessly done to death beyond the wall at the 
behest of a mysterious queen, — all of these 
appeals stirred our emotions, but not seldom 
each of us read a different meaning in the sym- 
bol. Howbeit, when we grew fainthearted we 
remembered that after all Symbolism was a 
phase, an expression, of Mysticism, and that all 
lofty imaginations were marked by a mystic 
element. Our memories drifted back to the 
heaven-scaling myths of Plato ; and we recalled 
the teachings of Emerson, with his reiterated 
admonitions against literalism and earthliness. 
Even the cold scientific voice of Pasteur rang 
in our ears : " How wretched are they who have 
only clear ideas ! " Ever we felt that we might 
be holding in our hands a golden key to a 
glorious treasure ; and ever we feared that the 
fault must lie within ourselves. But now we 
may quote Aglavaine's suggestive avowal that 
" there is nothing more beautiful than a key, as 
long as we do not know what it opens," and we 
are no longer quite so prone to blame ourselves. 
Nay, we have lived to be able to write down these 
words from the lips of Maeterlinck the essayist, 
who is constantly needed as a commentator on 
Maeterlinck the dramatist. 

" Is the poet's duty not rather to furnish an explana- 
tion loftier, clearer, more widely and profoundly human 
than any his reader can find for himself? It is time 
that the poet should realize that the symbol is legitimate 
only when it stands for accepted truth, or for truth 
which as yet we cannot or will not accept; but the 
symbol is out of place at a time when it is truth itself 
that we seek. And besides, to merit admission into a 
really living poem, the symbol should be at least as 
great and beautifid as the truth for which it stands, and 
should, moreover, precede tl\is truth, and not follow a 
long way behind." 

With some such concession it becomes possi- 
ble to assign Symbolism its legitimate field and 
function. For the majority of us, life is made 
up of the day's work in some form or other, of 
trivial pleasures and ordinary pains, and finally of 
our closer association with the mystery of things. 
The three divisions naturally vary as to relative

importance with almost every individual, even 
as they vary from time to time in the individual 
himself. Naturally, too, they interact and are 
not ultimately separable. Roughly speaking, 
however, the partition is valid, despite the myste- 
riousness of the commonplace and the occasional 
commonplaceness of what seems the supreme 
mystery. Even the most ordinary of us come at 
times very close to the final heights and depths, to 
heaven or hell. We rise for a moment to the 
level of the love of the woman who loves us ; 
we rebel with all frustrated spirits when we are 
torn from her and our dream. Or, in the brood- 
ing stillness of some four walls that shut us from 
the world, we seem to be borne out on the un- 
fathomable flow of time to eternity, untU we 
reach the realm where nothing is felt and noth- 
ing is real save the pidsations of the universe, 
with which the throbbings of our own heart are 
at one. In such a moment some of us are prone 
to feel that the mystery is solved, because we 
have realized that we are a part thereof ; and a 
deep joy is shed over our being. But to others 
of us the mystery appears only more transcend- 
ental, more baffling, more (let us be honest in 
our heart of hearts) more bitter. The music 
of the spheres to you may be a moan of pain to 
me. Howbeit, the true mystic, whether finding 
joy or pain, concludes that mystery is alike the 
final reality and the only clarity ; and it is a nat- 
ural step to conclude that only by myth and sym- 
bol can soul speak to soul. Le style de Vecole 
c'est la philosophie de Vecole. But herewith 
arises the old, old danger of emphasizing a part 
until it becomes more than the whole ; and only 
the supreme leader is safe. The greatest writer 
is he who compasses alike the day's work with- 
out being filled by its soul-choking dust ; the 
trivial pains and pleasures, without being lulled 
in their benumbing circle ; and the highest 
mysteries, without losing himself in mysticism 
or ecstasy. To teach us about these things, he 
will command every possibility of the world of 
the word. Symbolism will be a noble minister 
of his will. But he will use it as Plato used it, 
or Dante, or Shakespeare ; and in his loftiest 
soaring he will never quite lose from sight the 
every-day world beneath ; the winged steeds of 
his imagination will never quite escape the 
masterfid rein. He will praise silence, as 
Carlyle or Emerson praised it ; but he will 
speak to us by his word as well as by his reti- 
cence, and will remember that Symbolism is an 
approximation to the mysterious language of 
silence. Never will he make the symbol greater 
than what is symbolized, nor will he always 



disdain ordinary channels of communication in 
favor of the soul-message of figure and metaphor. 

Herewith, if a little presumption be allowed 
us, we may hope that we have touched upon 
some of the straying tendencies of the modem 
Symbolist movement as seen in French litera- 
ture during the last half-century. It is dis- 
tinctly a revolt against Materialism ; but its 
advocates must not insist that no other form of 
revolt can be beautiful and fruitful. In a prac- 
tical age, it dwells laudably on the importance 
of being and becoming as opposed to doing ; 
and yet we cannot accept quite fully " the 
infinite insignificance of action." Again, be- 
cause every great writer has elements of mysti- 
cism in him, and uses myth or symbol when he 
will, it is hardly fair to conclude that conscious 
and exclusive Symbolism should be made the 
whole of literature, or even that it represents 
the only line of advance from the present 
stage. Silence, if we care to be concessively 
esoteric, may be the most eloquent language of 
the soul, and the symbol may be nearer silence 
than the spoken word ; but it does not follow 
that a writer can be most effective by using 
only silences and symbols. Even between two 
souls in perfect communion — to take the ex- 
ample to which the Symbolists themselves con- 
stantly recur — the ideal lover and the ideal 
beloved, life could not be always an unbroken 
silence or its language limited to a caress. To 
make literature untempered Symbolism, the 
deliberate Symbolism that shall be the whole 
work and not the great moment therein, is 
equivalent to asking us to live always either in 
blinding light or depressing gloom. '•'■A chacun 
son infini " proclaims Villiers de L'Isle-Adam ; 
and we glady acquiesce. But for most of us, 
our infinity must still remember the day's work 
and the lowly duties ; and literature must follow 
the steps of life or lose its only path to the 
heights. In so far as Symbolism brings us to 
a healthful and inspiring appreciation of " the 
prophets who have redeemed the world, the 
artists who have made the world beautiful, and 
the lovers who have quickened the pulses of the 
world," in so far as it helps us to live at our 
finest intensity morally and aesthetically, we 
must heed its voice and acclaim its service. But 
withal it must come for judgment to the bar of 
life, where so many movements find pitiless 
arbitrament. 

In any event, whatever be our attitude to the 
movement, we must find its history keenly in- 
teresting ; and when the account thereof comes 
from the glowing pen of Mr. Arthur Symons 



376

the interest will for many be quickened into 
delight. One may quarrel with this frankly 
partisan historian at whatever turn one will; 
but his book remains exceptionally attractive 
and enlightening. He has wisely chosen to fol- 
low the development of the principle in France, 
" the country of movements," although he sees 
it spreading over all Europe as the one quick- 
ening impulse in literature. As a result of this 
deliberate limitation, he is able to give a con- 
nected and not inadequate treatment of the 
development of Symbolism in the hands of a 
strangely diverse group of men. There could 
hardly be a more enlightening comment on the 
potential inclusiveness of the movement than 
the depiction of its outworking in the actual 
instances he has selected. The mad and dream- 
ing Gerard de Nerval, the proud aristocratic 
Villiers, the restless poet-trader-explorer Rim- 
baud, the sensual religious Verlaine, the gentle 
aspiring Maeterlinck, and the rest, — where 
could one find such representatives of another 
literary movement? Where could one find 
another movement that shoidd allow their kin- 
ship with all their divergence ? 

Mr. Symons's introductory chapter is a bril- 
liantly clever attempt to identify the new 
Symbolist movement with the fundamental sym- 
bolism that has played so large a part in human 
development. " Symbolism began with the first 
words uttered by the first man, as he named 
every living thing ; or before then, in heaven, 
when God named the world into being." A 
little later, we find interwoven Carlyle's unfor- 
gettable vindication : "In the symbol proper, 
what we can call a symbol, there is ever more 
or less distinctly and directly some embodiment 
and revelation of the Infinite, the Infinite is 
made to blend itself with the Finite, to stand 
visible, and as it were attainable there." Thus 
our guide leads us skilfully up to the logical 
obstacles of our colder moods, and winningly 
persuades us they are not there, until we are 
almost ready to admit that in Symbolism we 
have set our feet upon " the one pathway lead- 
ing through beautiful things to eternal beauty," 
and enabling literature " to come closer to 
humanity, to everything in humanity that may 
have begun before the world and may outlast 
it." If we coidd read only Mr. Symons and 
not some of the Symbolist literature itself, we 
might believe that herein art and conduct and 
the dream are at last brought into a glorious 
harmony that at once simplifies and beautifies 
these three elements of life which often appear 
so dissonant. From his glowing tribute it is 



hard to return to the thought that Symbolism 
too must have its frailties ; that it, like all other 
work of man's hand, will show inequalities of 
craftsmanship ; that the lives of its votaries 
have frequently been far from indicating its 
saving grace ; that the mystagogue has some- 
times been hard to distinguish from the char- 
latan. Mr. Symons himself is prompt to 
recognize that much of the output of the repre- 
sentatives of Symbolism has served no tangible 
purpose ; but nevertheless his pages glow with 
hope and faith. Always, as you read, you wish 
you could see with his eyes. 

The beginning of the movement our histo- 
rian traces to Gerard de Nerval (1808-1855), 
although with him Symbolism was still com- 
paratively unconscious. In this pathetic figure 
any student of human nature must find grim 
food for thought. Living the transfigured life 
of the dreamer, but sinking often to the most 
flagrant bestiality, he wrote between intervals 
of madness, or even during the very onslaughts 
of his malady. It is easy to be impatient with 
his vagaries when he is sane ; but it is almost 
impossible not to weep over the waking dreams 
of his madness. It was with strange appropri- 
ateness that his insanity declared itself by his 
leading a lobster into the Palais Royal at the 
end of a blue ribbon. " (' Because,' he said, 
' it does not bark, and knows the secrets of the 
sea.')" But we must not mar for our readers 
the picture drawn by Mr. Symons of this 
incredible writer, " graceful and elegant when 
he is sane ; but only inspired, only really wise, 
passionate, collected, only reaUy master of him- 
self, when he is insane." We are bovmd, how- 
ever, to transcribe the estimate given as to his 
place in the movement we are discussing. 

" Gerard de Nerval, then, had divined, before all the 
world, that poetry should be a miracle ; not a hymn to 
beauty, nor the description of beauty, nor beauty's 
mirror; but beauty itself, the colour, fragrance and 
form of the imagined flower, as it blossoms again out of 
the page. Vision, the over-powering vision, had come 
to him beyond, if not against, his will; and he knew 
that vision is the root out of which the flower must 
grow. Vision had taught him symbol, and he knew 
that it is by symbol alone that the flower can take vis- 
ible form. He knew that the whole mystery of beauty 
can never be comprehended by the crowd, and that 
while clearness is a virtue of style, perfect explicitness 
is not a necessary virtue." 

Here, if we follow Mr. Symons, begins the lit- 
erature " in which the visible world is no longer 
a reality, and the unseen world no longer a 
dream." With de Nerval arises that use of 
words " which create an atmosphere by the 
actual quality of their syllables, as, according to 



1908.]

the theory of Mallarme, they should do, as in 
the recent attempts of the Symbolists, writer 
after writer has endeavored to lure them into 
doing." To him we may trace that striving 
for the perfection of form that shall annihilate 
form. In his lyrics we hear the preliminary 
notes that foretell the " art of Verlaine in 
bringing verse to a bird's song, the art of 
Mallarme in bringing verse to the song of an 
orchestra." In his dramatic writing, the stage 
is prepared for Villiers to make drama " the 
iembodiment of spiritual forces, "for Maeterlinck 
to make it " not even their embodiment, but the 
remote sound of their voices." We may only 
tarry long enough to query whether it is quite 
certain that verse should be brought to the song 
of a bird or an orchestra ; whether it is not 
possible that the bird and the orchestra are 
doing their parts fairly well, and that verse has 
a function of its own ; and whether the drama 
is reaUy at its highest when it becomes only 
the remote sound of the voices of spiritual 
forces, as in some of the famous " marionette " 
plays. In any event, de Nerval seems to have 
made ready the mystic way to these mystic 
extremes. 

With ViUiers (1838-1889), "the Don 
Quixote of Idealism," we come to the conscious 
stage of the movement, with which most of us are 
more familiar. In addition to authors mentioned 
elsewhere in the course of this notice, Mr. Symons 
treats Jules Laforgue, Stephane Mallarme, and 
" the later " Huysmans. With reference to the 
last named, " who began by acquiring so aston- 
ishing a mastery of description that he could 
describe the inside of a cow hanging in a butcher's 
shop as beautifully as if it were a casket of jewels," 
we should like to enter upon a controversy ; but 
already we have gone beyond our allotted space. 
It is safe to say that almost every reader will 
share the reviewer's desire to fight it out on 
many points ; it is equally safe to say that those 
who quarrel most will not enjoy the book least. 
We have enjoyed it thoroughly, finding it stimu- 
lating and valuable. Our pleasure was greatly 
heightened by the style, which is worthy of the 
spirit wherewith Mr. Symons approached his 
subject ; and that is saying much. 

We should point out, in conclusion, that the 
volume must be taken for what it is. It con- 
tains no systematic attempt to connect the 
modem Symbolist movement in literature with 
the great mystics of other centuries or other 
spheres. Upon the relations between mysticism 
and race-heredity it does not even touch, although 
the problem is fundamental. In short, we have 



before us not a searching philosophical treatise, 
but a delightful bit of literary history and 
aesthetic appreciation.

The EvoiiUTioN of Religious Thought.* 



A consideration of the personality of Dr. 
Hoffman, author of " The Sphere of Religion," 
and of the institutions which he represents, 
reveals a striking perspective. As compared 
with his predecessor in the true apostolic (i.e., 
missionary) succession, he presents a notable 
example of progress. No deeper or more inter- 
esting change in men's religious thought, belief, 
and life was probably ever wrought than that 
which has sQently taken place within the last 
three decades. The Protestant Reformation, 
linked as it was with politics, economics, new 
trade routes, the rise and fall of governments, 
and the sweeping away of the survivals of feudal- 
ism, was vastly more violent. The more modern 
change has been as the coming of morning light 
— evolution without revolution. At Schenec- 
tady, until the hour of his death in May, 1877, 
Professor Tayler Lewis, past-master of Hebrew 
and seventeenth-century orthodoxy, contended 
valiantly for those notions of religion then 
thought mighty to save, but which are now, 
without observation, melting into the infinite 
azure. In this year of grace behold a feUow, 
elder in the same noble old Reformed Church 
in the same city. Professor Lewis's successor in 
the professorial chair at Union College, preach- 
ing that " man's religion develops as he himself 
develops." Axiomatic indeed, but hardly ac- 
cording to Dort. Again he writes : 

" Even if we allow that every word in Scripture came 
directly from the lips of the Almighty, no man could 
ever be more than probably certain that he correctly 
heard the words when they were uttered, or correctly 
wrote them down, or correctly understood them after 
they were written, either by themselves or in their mutual 
relations. . . . All that the profoundest thinker can do 
for them is to establish their probable truthfulness." 

This is the author's comment on the Apostles' 
creed, traditionally so called ; but it applies, he 
tells us, " with equal force, to every creed in

sentative of that Church which had, on Manhat- 
tan in 1628, the first fuUy organized Protestant 
church on this continent, and which carries as 
historic impedimenta an enormous bulk of " bal- 
ance of probabilities " inherited from Athanasius 
and of mediaeval tradition from the apostles, 
Guido de Bres, Ursinus, and the theologians 
of the State Church at Dordrecht. Yet these 
wise and sane words of Dr. Hoffman will be 
acceptable to all churches. Let one read his 
thirteen analyses and digests of the sacred books 
of Babylon, Egypt, India, and China; of Jewish, 
Buddhist, and Christian literature ; of the teach- 
ings of Mohammed, Joseph Smith, Mrs. Eddy, 
and Madame Blavatsky, and judge whether this 
man is not of the spirit of him who said, 
"Other sheep have I, which are not of this 
fold." On his title-page he writes, " Truth, by 
whomsoever uttered, is from God." Could any 
sentiment be more truly Christian in spirit ! 

This is a book that may best be judged by 
quotations. Thus its power is manifest. Dr. 
Hoffman asks that 

" Every student of theology take up the subject pre- 
cisely as he would every other science. . . . We believe 
that even the teachings of Jesus should be . . . accepted 
or rejected on the ground of their inherent reason- 
ableness." 

" The view of today is that we get our ideas of God 
from what we know of the universe about us and from 
what we know about ourselves." 

" God is all the time incarnating himself in human 
history. We cannot set any limits to his incarnation 
in the future." 

In other words, what is in one century the artil- 
lery of the church becomes its baggage in the 
next. The " sphere of religion," then, is like 
the sphere of the air : it is all around us and 
we are in it. 

Thus in fewer than four hundred pages Dr. 
Hoffman shows his conception of the nature 
of religion and its influence on civilization. 
. " Religion is the key to history." Crystal clear 
is the whole of this eminently sane and practical 
discussion. Even " the man in the street " wiU 
want to finish the book. That it will be widely 
read is certain. Issuing from a thinker who is 
prominently identified with one of the most con- 
servative churches of honorable history, notable 
for its sanity and power, its simplicity, direct- 
ness, and grasp, the book is a landmark in the 
history of religious thought.

Two New Studies of Petrarch.* 



When the sixth centenary of Petrarch was 
celebrated, three years ago, there were pub- 
lished a few noteworthy books — translations 
of his sonnets and interpretations of his life 
and work as one of the major apostles of the 
Renaissance. Since this impetus the interest 
has increased ; readers of all nationalities, who 
seek inspiration and delight from pure litera- 
ture, have responded to the products of this 
poet and humanist, and also have found pleas- 
lu-e in the biographical studies by his devotees 
of earlier as well as more recent years. Two 
notable contributions of the current season re- 
present an aftermath of research and inter- 
pretation, proclaiming the personal traits of 
Petrarch, his literary purposes, and his rank 
as adjudged by modem scholars. 

The brief study, " Petrarch and the Ancient 
World," by M. de Nolhac, curator of the 
Palace of Versailles, is an expansion of an 
address delivered by the author in this country', 
and now issued as a volume in " The Humanists' 
Library " from the Merrymount Press. It is 
fitting that one who cherished and collected 
classic writings in their simple and beautiful 
forms should have been thus honored by Mr. 
Updike in one of his finest examples of book- 
making. The aim of this study is definite, — 
a recognition of Petrarch's work as scholar and 
humanist-poet " who revived once more the 
worship of the Ancient World." In accom- 
plishing this work for literature, Petrarch 
brought a mind of marked poetic sensibility 
to the study of the great masters of the clas- 
sics, especially Virgil and Cicero. With scorn 
and keen raillery for all false science of his 
day, with a sharp tongue and pen against all 
charlatans, Petrarch was sometimes guilty of 
too great indifference towards contemporary 
methods and leaders. Archaeology and his- 
tory, especially from the perspective of the 
moralist, appealed to him both as a scholar and 
a poet. " Petrarch dreamed as a poet, and 
wrote as a poet, even when he believed his 
mission to be the restoration and reproduction 
in his own books of the knowledge of the an- 
cients ; and that alone was enough to keep him 
from being a pedant, even when he paid the 
highest homage to pedantry." An interesting 
and valuable portion of this book is devoted to 
Petrarch's library and its gradual acquisition

through personal quests and the aid of friends 
in many countries. With due emphasis the 
author recounts Petrarch's services to literature 
through the discovery and preservation, with 
the aid of trained copyists under his direction, 
of certain letters and discourses of Cicero. 

The second of our two biographical and 
critical studies is more detailed and ambitious. 
It is excellent in its revealment of Petrarch's 
temperament, of the vital influences of his en- 
vironment and friendships, and of the pictorial 
story, of his daily life at Vaucluse in activity as 
host and in literary retirement. The author, 
Mr. Hollway-Calthrop, is discriminating and 
conservative in his treatment of the various 
aspects of the poet's life. Acknowledging his 
obligations to earlier biographers — notably 
de Sade, Baldelli, Fracassetti, and Koerting — 
he casts aside some of the romantic suppositions 
indulged by other biographers, and frankly per- 
mits the reader either to imagine or to leave 
in mystery the identity of the poet's mistress 
and the intimate details of Petrarch's relations 
with her. He says: "Who was Laura? 
Frankly, we do not know. In all probability 
Petrarch purposely destroyed all marks of 
identification ; if this was his intention, his 
success was complete, and the riddle will prob- 
ably never be answered with certainty." That 
Laura was only an allegorical term, however, 
as some would surmise, the author of this study 
refuses to believe, in face of the CAddence from 
Petrarch's letters, and his notes in the Virgil 
which was his constant companion and is now 
preserved in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. 
Much effort has been made to show that Laura 
was the wife of Count Hugo de Sade ; but such 
a claim rests largely on surmises and ingenious 
if not forced interpretations. Yet if the identity 
of Laura is hidden in secrecy, the author doubts 
not that she " was a real woman, and Petrarch 
was desperately her lover." Moreover, her 
influence was paramount in unfolding his emo- 
tional and poetic nature, in raising his standards 
of thought and piety until he confessed in his 
" Secretum," " Through love of her I attained 
to love of God. It was she who reclaimed my 
youthful spirit from all baseness." Intellect- 
ually, the youth became a man under the 
influence of this passion, and the immature 
verses of " Juvenalia" were destroyed by him 
as insincere and unworthy, while the " Can- 
zoniere," written under the stimulus of this love 
and its memory, have given Petrarch an unques- 
tioned place among the world's masters of love- 
songs and sonnets. 



Among the earlier influences upon Petrarch, 
as emphasized by this biographer, was the en- 
vironment of his childhood home on the Tuscan 
estate at Incisa. Although Arezzo chanced to 
be his birthplace, he passed there only a few 
months of babyhood, while the first seven years 
of an impressionable boyhood were spent amid 
the beauties and melodies of Tuscany. Bologna, 
Genoa, Florence, Rome, and other places of 
historical and romantic associations, played 
their parts in his mental and poetic growth. 
Two influences which contributed largely to his 
happiness and temperamental development were 
his travels and his friends. He was, in truth, 
" always a wanderer," yet he was also at times 
a hermit, a lover of the country, an earnest 
student, and a poet with such fixed and exalted 
aspirations that he well merited the " Crown of 
Song " bestowed by the hands of King Robert 
of Sicily. 

The friends of Petrarch were many and of 
varied types — popes and cardinals, statesmen 
and political intriguers, men of erudition and 
women of sensuous charm. In his friendship 
alike with Cardinal Colonna and Rienzi he 
proved a fervid politician and a wise counsellor. 
Of all his friendships, that with Boccaccio has 
the greatest interest to literary students, and 
the younger man owed much of his development 
as poet to the cordial and stimulating friend- 
ship of Petrarch. The two men were supple- 
mentary in their mental qualities, as Mr. 
Hollway-Calthrop has thus indicated : 

" The life of neither could be reckoned complete till 
he had found his fellow. Petrarch had an anxious 
spirit ; under every rose he looked for the thorn, and if 
he failed to find it he vexed his soul with questioning 
whether it ought not to have pricked him. Boccaccio 
plucked the flower and wore it with a gay assurance 
that took no note of thorn-pricks. . . . They were alike 
in their enthusiasm for learning and in their indefati- 
gable industry, but they were alike in hardly anything 
else. Petrarch was incomparably the riper scholar, the 
sounder critic; he had a more reasoned judgment, a 
more cultivated taste; Boccaccio had the more fertile 
imagination, the brighter wit. Petrarch was lucid in 
argument, but apt to be prolix in narrative; Boccaccio 
showed little talent ^or disquisition, but his was the 
story-teller's inimitable gift." 

By liberal quotations from Petrarch's letters, 
and through the testimony of friends, the biog- 
rapher gives a vivid impression of the life at 
Vaucluse, and of the lovable and regrettable 
traits of the poet. He acknowledges frankly 
the errancy of Petrarch's disposition in dealing 
with Giovanni, his illegitimate and stubborn son 
whose perverseness and idleness increased rather 
than lessened under the rigorous and anxious

training of the father. Attention is given to 
Petrarch's poem " Africa," which, although a 
failure artistically, is of value historically in 
tracing the revival of learning. Historical stu- 
dents are indebted also to his " Lives of Illus- 
trious Men," consisting of thirty-one biographies, 
nearly one-half of the volume of seven hundred 
and fifty pages being devoted to the life of 
Caesar. 

While this study of Petrarch is essentially a 
personal revelation of the man in the midst of 
political and literary associates, and in happy 
retirement among his books and gardens at Vau- 
cluse, there are some forceful sentences of criti- 
cal analysis upon his place as poet and humanist. 
With characteristic caution, the true meaning of 
his mission is thus stated : 

"When, therefore, we say that Petrarch founded 
Humanism and inaugurated the New Learning, we do 
not mean that he created sonaething out of nothing ; we 
mean that he inspired ideas and modes of thought, which 
preceding scholars had possessed in their own brains, but 
could not commimicate to society at large." 

In actual scholarship, and in Latin compositions, 
Petrarch was inferior to some of his contempo- 
raries and successors who are more directly con- 
nected with the Renaissance movement. He 
sought not merely to revive study of the classics 
but " to bring the world back to the mental 
standpoint of the classical writers." The lover 
of Petrarch will rejoice in this latest sympathetic 
revelation of his personality, and the reader who 
first seeks acquaintance with the poet will find 
here a discriminating yet enthusiastic guide who 
has made good use of the material already pub- 
lished and added several unfamiliar extracts from 
Petrarch's frank and charming letters.

Briefs on Ne^v Books. 



Examinations ^^ turning the very first leaf of Mr. 
of life and Henry Dwight Sedgwick's collected 

literature. pieces, "The New American Type, 

and Other Essays" (Houghton), one's attention is 
pleasantly arrested. The dedication, " To S. S. M., 
Amicse Mirabili, Matri Admirabili, Socrui Incom- 
parabili," with its cumulative praise expressed in 
three successive adjectives in -bilis, each stronger 
than the preceding, is such a tribute to a mother-in- 
law as is not often met with in this naughty world — 
in books at least. The " new American type " is 
the nervous, unreposeful type portrayed by Mr. 
Sargent, Mr. Thayer, Mr. Alexander, and other 
modern painters of American portraits, as contrasted 
with the self-satisfied, self-contained type seen in the 
canvases of Stuart and Copley. The essay was in- 



spired by a stroll through a picture gallery. The 
second paper treats of " The Mob Spu-it in Litera- 
ture," and divides the reading mob into the prole- 
tarian or dime-novel-reading section, the lower 
bourgeois section, which is addicted to Albert Ross, 
E. P. Roe, and the like, and the upper bourgeois 
section, which reads such popular novelists as Win- 
ston Churchill, Charles Major, Thomas Dixon, Jr., 
and HalHe Erminie Rives. This mob spirit is not 
admirable, and in Mr. Sedgwick's opinion, " if there 
were critics, men of natural gifts and educated taste, 
experienced in the humanities, there would be no 
mob ; for the condition of headlessness, of ungnided- 
ness, is essential to a mob. But there are no Amer- 
ican critics, except Mr. Henry James, who confines 
himself to a consideration of foreigners." Rather 
severe, this, on American literary criticism, or what 
passes as such. Moreover, even in Europe, in 
England and in France, where it seems to be ad- 
mitted that there are literary critics, the craze for the 
latest literary sensation is hardly less unrestrained 
than with us. In the third essay, on Mrs. Wharton, 
the author does her scant justice in denying her 
almost every excellence but " cleverness." To him 
she is one who makes an effective display of what 
has been studied up in books and museums and pic- 
ture galleries, while on the deeper things of life she 
has little hold. Surely there are passages even in 
her brilliantly successful " House of Mirth " that 
show a moi'e than superficial acquaintance with stern 
realities. Other chapters, on educational, social, and 
bookish themes, follow; and the book closes with 
an ingenious political forecast entitled "The Coup 
d'Etat of 1961." The writer's ideals are high, and 
his style that of a critic " of natural gifts and edu- 
cated taste, experienced in the humanities " — even 
though he does deny the existence among us of any 
such guides in the things of literature. 

Followers of the fortunes of the 
and^helook. American drama will note with in- 
terest the appearance in book form 
of Mr. Percy Mackaye's new play, " The Scare- 
crow" (Macmillan). We do not suppose it can be 
called a closet^drama, for it is undoubtedly meant 
for the stage ; and yet we cannot speak of it as one 
sees it on the stage, for we do not even know 
whether it has ever been acted. Considering the 
book thus — with a thought of the stage, but still as 
a book — we find a good deal of interest in it, but 
not quite as much as we should like. A play, to 
be really successful, should, to our mind, have some 
import or significance in its idea. We do not mean 
that it should necessarily be a miracle-play, or a 
problem-play, or a symbolic-play ; but it ought to 
have a subject that really interests people. And 
this *' The Scarecrow " has. The conception of 
Ravensbane as the incongruity between our real 
souls and our lofty pretensions or ideals, — that is 
something that is worth while. If it be well done, 
people will be interested. In another quality of 
the drama — namely, the being something that can

be readily seen, that shall present its meaning 
strongly in terms of sight, — in this also Mr. 
Mackaye is successful, especially in Act I. And 
as to structure, another dramatic necessity, the play 
has a plot. If, then, we find the piece to have these 
three excellent possibilities, of significance, scenic 
capacity, and construction, what does it lack ? We 
think it lacks coherence. The story of the play 
that is developed in the plot does not appear to us 
to have the same significance as the character of 
Ravensbane, as the general idea of the play. The 
two things distract our thoughts instead of intensi- 
fying the impression. And although if the play 
were presented we should doubtless be interested in 
what we saw, yet we do not readily imagine any 
definite situation, figure, or scene, that seems typi- 
cal of the one thing the author had it at heart to 
impress. So it is possible that the play would not 
have been entirely appreciated without the explana- 
tion of the preface. But of course a dramatist will 
want his work to impress itself without the help of 
comment. 

Tiie battle of ^^^ Massachusetts Commandery of 
Oetty»burg,by the Military Order of the Loyal 
an eye-witness. Legion has reprinted Colonel Frank 
A. Haskell's contemporary narrative of the battle 
of Gettysburg. A native of New England, a grad- 
uate of Dartmouth, and a Wisconsin lawyer at the 
outbreak of the Civil War, Colonel Haskell was 
killed at Cold Harbor in 1864. At Gettysburg he 
was an aide-de-camp on the staff of General Gibbon, 
who temporarily commanded the Second corps of 
Meade's army. Hancock and Gibbon were both 
wounded on the third day of the battle, and the 
opportunity thus came to Colonel Haskell to take 
upon himself the bringing up of reinforcements, to 
distinguish himself by intelligent appreciation of 
the urgent needs of the moment, and by personal 
bravery, and also to see much of the contest that 
raged about the centre of the Union line. A few 
days after the battle he rode back to the field from 
Maryland, and confirmed his conception of its 
topography. His narrative of the campaign, dated 
July 16, 1863, was first published by his family, 
and a second edition, with certain unfortunate alter- 
ations and omissions, was printed by the Dartmouth 
College Class of 1854. It is to be regretted that 
the present edition — the third — of this important 
chapter of contemporary evidence should not have 
given the narrative just as it was written by Colonel 
Haskell. His classmate, Hall, an aide-de-camp on 
General Howard's staff, has attempted to justify the 
omissions and alterations, in a foot-note in the pres- 
ent edition, with the unwarranted assumption that 
Haskell, if he had lived, would have changed his view. 
Such an assumption is especially to be condemned 
from the fact that the suppressed views of Colonel 
Haskell were the views always maintained by the 
most competent officers in the army — Hancock, 
Humphreys, Warren, Gibbon, and General Meade 
himself. 



Functions and The ChuTch of To-day is a subject 
Ihe^Church ^^^^ offers SO many phases — phases 

of To-day. so difficult of reconciliation and cap- 

able of so much deficiency and so much exaggeration 
in their presentation — that candor and adequacy in 
a book about it are very observable qualities. The 
little volume of Dr. Joseph Henry Crooker ("The 
Church of To-day," Pilgrim Press, Boston) is re- 
markable both for comprehensiveness and sobriety. 
The author works up to the line of truth, and rarely 
if ever transcends it. The functions he assigns the 
Church, and the reasons he gives for its existence, 
are sound and sufficient, and bear the emphasis put 
upon them. Even an opponent, if there is any pene- 
trative and lenient thought in him, can hardly fail 
to feel that the subject is broader and profounder 
than he has been accustomed to regard it. So gen- 
eral a movement among mankind, taking on so many 
directions, must stand closely associated with equally 
universal natural forces. An habitual mistake means 
something. This copious rendering of reasons, in 
the searching light of our time, in behalf of an 
institution so often and so deeply in error, means 
very much. The presentation is somewhat ideal, as 
it needs must be ; yet the real Church so opens the 
way to it, and gives so much impulse in the pursuit, 
that we feel at once that conception, search, and 
attainment are one growing and indivisible blessing. 
If the part played by the Church is so comprehensive 
and catholic as not only to shake off special faults 
and bigotries, but to place every organization of this 
order on the broad basis of service rendered, we are 
led, without carping or criticism, to find in it the 
truest and simplest means of progress. There are 
gathered up in the Church — a church that may 
assume forms as numerous as are the wants of men, 
and is to be judged in each of them by its imme- 
diate adaptability — a depth and wealth of motive, 
a ceaseless incentive to effort not otherwise to be 
attained. The frequent failures of the Church indi- 
cate not so much its lack of intrinsic fitness as they 
do the ever-growing labor laid upon it. The author 
of this thoughtful book is to be congratulated on the 
inner light he brings to the theme, and his clear per- 
ception of its significance. 

Few great men of so long ago are 
inEnXtX^. represented by so large and rich a 

collection of letters as Martin Luther. 
And these letters illuminate his career from every 
point of view, — as reformer, as one of the founders 
of the modern High German tongue, and as a great 
typical German. They have been collected and well 
edited in Germany by De Wette, Kolde, and Enders, 
aside from the smaller selections from them that 
appear in the various biogi'aphies and household 
editions of Luther's works. But Luther is too little 
known at first hand by the mass of English-speaking 
people. Following the attitude of the Lutheran 
Church, he has been represented as an almost super- 
human saint, surrounded already by a body of folk- 
lore. In fact, he was the most German man of the

past, with most of the frailties as well as most of 
the charm and greatness of the German character. 
This is revealed very frankly in his letters, and it was 
a good undertaking to present a considerable selec- 
tion of these to the English world. Mrs. Currrie has 
followed the text and the chronology of De Wette, 
and has on the whole been wise in her selections. 
They are the letters which are most commonly cited 
in Luther biographies. In fact, they would constitute 
of themselves a fair biography of Luther if only they 
had been provided with more prefatory and explan- 
atory matter. It would have been desirable to 
introduce this matter at the expense even of some of 
the selections. It should have been stated, also, that 
the letters have been cut and altered in detail very 
much beyond what is indicated by the usual signs 
of omission. Finally, it is a great pity that a volume 
otherwise so handsomely and carefully prepared 
should not have been submitted to thorough criti- 
cism by an expert German scholar. Not only is the 
translation very free, — it suffers from the presence 
on almost every page of numerous and serious errors 
in sense. Eobanus Hesse, the humanist, is named 
and referred to persistently as Cobanus Hesse, an 
error due evidently to mistaking a German capital E 
for a C, the two being quite similar. In the single 
short letter to Luther's wife, of July 29, 1534, occur 
these slips: In the ascription the jesting 'master' 
(Herr) before ' Kdthe ' is omitted ; Wie Du mich 
losmachst is rendered, ' How long you will get quit 
of me,' instead of ' How you can release me '; 
< Sonst komme ich vor dem neuen Bier nicht wieder ' 
is rendered, ' Or else I shall not be back before the 
new beer is ready,' instead of ' Or else I shall never 
get back (i. e., shall die) for (i. e., on account of) 
the fresh beer.' Aside from this, several phrases 
are omitted or transposed. The translation of the 
whole book needs careful revision, for the under- 
taking is important and highly commendable. ( "The 
Letters of Martin Luther." Macmillan Co.)

Bacon's essays, fygsh, clean, modem form, fully an- 
notated, prefaced, indexed, and otherwise admirably 
edited, cannot do better than turn to the edition 
that comes from the careful and scholarly hand of 
Miss Mary Augusta Scott, Ph.D., Professor of 
English at Smith College. One likes to learn, in 
Miss Scott's preface, that, though she is a teacher 
of English, she is "of those who deplore the dis- 
placement of Latin literature in our schools and 
colleges by vaguer subjects requiring less mental 
exertion." She well says that it is impossible to 
read Bacon understandingly without a knowledge 
■ of Latin, as he is likely to quote Tacitus or Cicero 
or Seneca on almost every page ; and she has, in 
her editing of the Essays, " made no effort to min- 
imize or to popularize" these ancient classics. 
" They are of the elect. They become more elect, 
more the aristocrats of letters, as an irrepressible 
and levelling democracy passes them by on its prim- 



rose path to an educational ideal of ' small Latin 
and less Greek.' " The notes draw frequently on 
two contemporary works for illustrative and explan- 
atory matter : they are the King James version of 
the Bible and the plays of Shakespeare. But Miss 
Scott is no mere bookworm : in the essay " Of 
Gardens" she has identified botanically all the 
plants and flowers there named, except those so 
familiar as to need no comment ; and she has also 
added a posy from Shakespeare's plays wherever 
possible. An eighty-page Introduction, which in- 
cludes an account of Bacon's life and literary work, 
precedes the Essays, and a full index completes the 
equipment of this serviceable and inexpensive 
edition. 

Times and From Messrs. Scribner's Sons comes 

manners in the latest book of Mr. Thomas Nelson 

Old Virginia. Page, the genial Virginian writer of 
romances and pleasant historical sketches. The 
present work, which he calls " The Old Dominion, 
Her Making and Her Manners," consists largely of 
papers that the author has read before historical 
societies and other gatherings. The collection is 
an appreciation of what Virginia has stood for in 
American history. The author writes in a reverent 
spirit. It is his belief that the early history of 
Virginia deserves more attention. " No page of the 
history of the race will better repay patient study ; 
for none shines with more heroic deeds, or more 
sublime fortitude and.endeavor." Virginia was " the 
foundation of a new nation." " She brought forth 
in time a new civilization where character and cour- 
tesy went hand in hand ; where the goal ever set 
before the eye was honor, and where the distin- 
guishing marks of the life were simplicity and sin- 
cerity." The book is about evenly divided as to 
contents between the old times and the new. 
Chapters one to five, on the Beginnings, Jamestown, 
Colonial Life, the Revolution, and the University of 
Virginia, while containing no new material, are so 
well written, with emphasis so well placed, that the 
lay reader will be thankful to the author for the 
rewriting. The second part, on Reconstruction, 
Virginia since the War, an Old Neighborhood, and 
an Old Virginia Sunday, while good, is of less value 
historically. These latter essays are rather in the 
nature of an appreciation of social conditions in the 
latter days. The book is a good example of the 
service a practiced writer may perform in re-casting 
the work of scientific historians for the benefit of 

average readers.

the many beautiful illustrations, there are only two or 
three ground-plans and no accompanying estimates 
of cost. The object of the pictures is to educate the 
reader, subtly and by pleasant and easy stages, up to 
the lesson of the text. House-building is an art with 
which the layman who wants distinctive and lastingly 
satisfactory results will do well not to meddle. He 
may choose his site, taking care that it is both intrin- 
sically desirable and suited to his need ; and he must 
acquaint his architect, who should also be chosen 
with the utmost consideration, with his family re- 
quirements. Beyond that, it seems, he should be con- 
tent with the part of on-looker, until, when the house 
is built and furnished and the site beautified in ac- 
cordance with the architect's plan, he may take over 
his property and enjoy it. Granted that the archi- 
tect is a good one, capable both in planning and in 
supervision, the enjoyment will be a lasting satis- 
faction, well worth both the extra cost and the re- 
nunciation of the delights of dabbling in the plans 
oneself. Having tried to inspire the reader with a 
wholesome distrust of his own power to superintend 
the building of just the house he wants, the authors 
attack certain popular prejudices, such as the insist- 
ence upon a certain favorite " style " for the house, 
or upon the conventional number of rooms when 
fewer and larger ones will really serve better. The 
final chapters complete the education of the would-be 
builder by setting forth some general principles of 
design and decoration which should guide him in 
judging architectural effects. The book is a strong 
presentation of the architect's side of the case, — 
but we think few house-builders will be willing to 
renounce, quite so completely as is here urged, a 
share in the planning and buUding of a house which 
they are to live in and pay for. 



^""Jca!?^ In adding to his admirable series 
discoveries in of "Heroes of American History" 
North America. (Harper) a volume on John and 
Sebastian Cabot, the accredited discoverers of the 
North American continent, concerning whom com- 
paratively so little is known, Mr. Frederick A. Ober 
takes occasion to present in readable form an account 
of the voyages of the Northmen to the western con- 
tinent five hundred years before the Cabots, and 
thus makes his book a narrative of discoveries in the 
region which we now know as North America. He 
is not in sympathy with the younger Cabot, or with 
his claims to have been an original discoverer ; but 
he gives a vivid picture of his relations to his con- 
temporaries, makes a contribution to the history of 
post-Columbian discoveries and explorations, and 
succeeds in disentangling some of the contradictory 
accounts in which the history of those discoveries has 
been involved. For example, he presents and sums 
up the evidence, which he finds conclusive, that 
John Cabot was in command of a ship that made a 
voyage to America in 1497, and that he landed on 
the northeast coast, probably between Labrador and 
Nova Scotia. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



M. Georges Pellissier has written a volume on 
" Voltaire Philosophe " (Paris : Colin) in which he sets 
forth the ideas of Voltaire upon metaphysics, religion, 
ethics, and politics. The author has made an interest- 
ing book, and has done his work conscientiously, having 
read the complete works of Voltaire by way of prepar- 
ation. "We fancy that few writers upon the subject 
may claim as much. His standpoint is one of sympa- 
thetic admiration, but he is by no means an uncritical 
eulogist. He does the public a particular service in 
correcting the errors of many of Voltaire's ignorant or 
inimical critics. 

A volume of "Studies in Mew England Transcen- 
dentalism," by Professor Harold Clarke Goddard, is 
published in the series of " Columbia University Studies 
in English." It is a work of limited scope and inten- 
sive character, being primarily a study of the Unitarian 
movement as it merged into transcendentalism, and 
giving rather more attention to Channing and Parker 
than to Emerson and Thoreau. The relations of tran- 
scendentalism to the practical life are discussed at much 
length, and there is a valuable appendix on the influence 
of German literature on nineteenth century New England 
thought. 

" A Teacher of Dante " is the title given to a volume 
containing seven studies in ItaUan literature from the 
pen of Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, published by Mo£Pat, 
Yard & Co. The most instructive chapter is the first, 
which gives its name to the collection. As to the other 
sections, we hardly need say that it is impossible to be 
uninteresting when one is writing under such captions 
as " Lyric Poetry and Petrarca," " Boccaccio and the 
Novella," or " Alfieri and Tragedy." The essays are 
obviously intended for the general reader, so we may be 
excused from recording any detailed criticism. On the 
whole, however, our impression is rather imsatisfactory; 
for we cannot escape the feeling that the book might 
have been made much more valuable by its well-known 
author, as well as more attractive. 

The students of history in our high schools may not 
be grateful, but they certainly ought to be, for the 
intelligence and judgment that have gone into recent 
text-books for their use. The gratitude of the teachers 
is, of course, beyond question. Of the many good books 
in this field that have been prepared of recent years, 
none are more admirable than those which we owe to 
Professor James Harvey Kobinson. His latest work, 
in two volumes, is "The Development of Modem 
Europe," a work designed as an introduction to the 
study of current history. Covering only the period 
from the age of Louis XIV. to the present time, these 
volumes present a much more ample treatment of the 
subject than is found in the " Western Europe " of the 
same series. Professor Charles E. Beard has collab- 
orated with Professor Robinson in the preparation of 
this work, which, like its predecessors, is pubhshed by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Holland celebrates this summer the tercentenary of 
the birth of her greatest painter, and the attention of 
the English-speaking world is called to the fact by the 
pubUcation of an extra number of " The International 
Studio" (Lane) with seventy plates reproducing 
Rembrandt's work and an appreciative commentary 
upon them by Emile Michel, the French critic whose 
monumental work on Rembrandt brings together so

[June 16, 



ably the results of modern research into the facts of the 
painter's life and achievement. The present essay does 
not, of course, attempt to be exhaustive either as com- 
ment or biography; but because the author has his 
material in perfect command he has been able to com- 
press a very vivid picture of the painter's personality 
and artistic development, and a clear account of his life 
as it related itself to his work, into a little over a hundred 
pages. His criticism does not confine itself wholly to 
the plates, and it keeps that happy mean between super- 
ficiality and technicality that is as rare as it is satisfac- 
tory. The plates, which are in photogravure or in tint 
on separately mounted sheets, are fine examples of the 
modern art of illustration, and for them alone the book 
would be well worth having. They include, besides 
many of Rembrandt's masterpieces, landscapes and 
other studies in chalk, sepia, pen, and wash, and a 
number of etchings. 



Notes. 



Miss Margaret Vere Farrington's " Fra Lippo Lippi: 
a Romance " has reached its fourth edition, now 
published, with photogravure illustrations, by Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

The third novel of Mr. F. Marion Crawford's 
" Margaret Donne " triology is already written, and 
will be published probably before the end of the year, 
with the title " The Diva's Ruby." 

« The Esthetic Experience: Its Nature and Function 
in Epistemology " is the subject of a monograph by Dr. 
William Davis Furry, now published as a supplementary 
issue of " The Psychological Review." 

" The Perfect Garden," by Mr. Walter Page Wright, 
editor of " The Gardener " and a well-known English 
expert on gardening and horticulture, is annoimced for 
early publication by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

A new volume shortly to appear in the Messrs. 
Macmillan's widely-known " Citizen's Library " is " The 
Principles of Anthropology and Sociology in their Rela- 
tions to Criminal Procedure," by Mr. Maurice Parmelee 
of Boston. 

Early this month the Messrs. Putnam will publish Dr. 
Fred Morrow Fling's " The Youth of Mirabeau," con- 
stituting the first part of what will be, when completed, 
a three-volume work with the general title " Mirabeau 
and the French Revolution." 

" The Indian Captive ; or, A Narrative of the Cap- 
tivity and Sufferings of Zadock Steele " is republished 
by the H. E. Himtting Co., Springfield, Mass., in the 
" Indian Captivities Series " of that house. The original 
was printed in 1816 at Montpelier, Vermont. 

In connection with Colonel Clark E. Carr's new 
volume, " My Day and Generation," it is interesting to 
note that his first book, " The Illini," is just appearing 
in a seventh edition. The publishers have added several 
portraits and a complete Index, and the author has 
revised the text throughout. 

A book on " The Acropohs of Athens," by Professor 
Martin L. d'Ooge of the University of Michigan, is 
announced for Fall publication by The Macmillan Com- 
pany. It will embody the results of a number of years of 
study and of repeated visits to Athens, where in 1886-87 
the author was Director of the American School of Class- 
ical Studies. 



A fourth edition of " A Popular History of Astron- 
omy," by Miss Agnes M. Clerke, is published by The 
Macmillan Company. This extremely interesting and 
valuable work deserves periodical reincarnations as fre- 
quently as may be warranted by new developments in 
the noble science with which it is concerned. 

A new and greatly enlarged edition of Mrs. Rosa 
Newmarch's volume on Tschaikowsky is now published 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. It has been edited 
by Mr. Edwin Evans, and gives us elaborate analyses 
of the more important works. To the " Pathetic Sym- 
phony " alone more than fifty pages are devoted. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have just published 
the Second Part of the Second Volume of Mr. Charles 
Sprague Sargent's "Trees and Shrubs." Twenty-five 
species are described and illustrated, and for once 
Cratsegus does not get the greater part of the space, 
being represented by only ten species, while Viburnum 
has thirteen examples. 

Three new volumes in the " Oxford Higher French 
Series," published by Mr. Henry Frowde, are as fol- 
lows: "Trois Portraits Litt^raires " (Molifere, Corneille, 
Racine), by Sainte-Beuve, edited by Mr. D. L. Savery; 
" Pages Choisies de Auguste Angellier," edited by Pro- 
fessor Emile Legouis ; and Gautier's " Espaiia " and 
" Emaux et Camdes," edited by M. C. Edmond Delbos. 

Two new books by Mr. T. H. S. Escott, author of 
" Society in the Country House," will be published at 
an early date by Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. Their 
titles are: " King Edward VII. and his Court " and « The 
Story of British Diplomacy." Mr. Escott has long been 
leading editorial writer for the London " Standard," and 
has recently succeeded Mr. John Morley as editor of the 
" Fortnightly Review." 

A limited reprint, on handmade paper, of the " Debate 
of the Body and the Soul," taken from an early four- 
teenth centiu-y manuscript and modernized by the late 
Professor Child of Harvard, is announced by the R. E. 
Lee Company of Boston. An introductory essay by 
Professor George Lyman Kittredge and illustrations 
by Miss Marion L. Peabody will be contributed to the 
edition. 

Among their Fall fiction, Houghton, Mifflin Company 
expect to publish new books by the following authors: 
Miss Mary Johnston, Mrs. Clara Louise Burnham, Miss 
Alice Brown, Charles Egbert Craddock, Mrs. Elizabeth 
Stuart Phelps Ward, and Mr. C. Hanford Henderson. 
They also will publish the first novel by Mr. Harry 
James Smith, whose recent short stories in the leading 
magazines have attracted considerable attention. 

Foiir German texts are the following: " German Com- 
position" (Holt), by Professor Paul R. Pope; Goethe's 
" The Vicar of Sesenheim " (Holt), being extracts from 
" Dichtung und Wahrheit," edited by Professor A. B. 
Nichols; « Der Weg zum Gluck " (Heath), being two 
short stories by Herr Viktor Bluthgen and Julius 
Lohmeyer, edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bernhardt; and 
" AUtagliches : Ein Konversations mid Lesebuch " 
(Heath), prepared by Mr. M. B. Lambert. 

An interesting little book in a field not hitherto 
occupied is that entitled "Weather and Weather 
Instruments," lately issued by the Taylor Instrument 
Companies of Rochester, N. Y. Explanations are given 
of the phenomena that make up weather, good and bad, 
and the instruments for foretelling or recording it, such 
as aneroids, barometers, barographs, thermometers, 
hygrometers, rain gauges, sim dials, and many more.

Co. Other English texts are Coleridge's "Literary 
Criticism," extracted from his various books, edited 
by Mr. J. W. Mackail, and published by Mr. Henry
