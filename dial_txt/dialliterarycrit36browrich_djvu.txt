A DISTINGUISHED BOOK OF ESSAYS 



FIFTH EDITION 

The Gentle Reader 

By SAMUEL McCHORD CROTHERS 

" T^HE appearance of a new essayist of promise," says Life.^ "is distinctly 
* a matter of congratulation. That manner of essay which is the 
crystallized essence of good soliloquy is far too rare and too little read. 
Dr. Samuel M. Crothers's volume, The Gentle Reader, contains a 
dozen such essays. They are a tasty compound of humor, good humor, 
and a whimsical good sense often deeper than it seems." " There is a 
fine flavor of intellectual good breeding about these papers," remarks 
The Outlook ; " a pervading air of familiarity with the best intellectual 
society. They are full of clear characterization, of keen comment on art 
and life, of well-poised judgments." The Chicago Tribune considers that 
" it is a long time since so happy a wit came along the humdrum highway 
of new books. He tickles the fancy delicately, and fills one with laughter, 
not boisterous, exhausting laughter, but that percolating sort which indi- 
cates the June of the spirit." " He illustrates," says the New York 
Evening Post., "a very genial personal philosophy with no little humor." 
" Bright, humorous, thoughtful, and thought-provoking reflections, these 
delightfully readable essays are not unworthy of a place beside the Auto- 
crat," in The Dial's opinion. " Through them all," remarks the San 
Francisco Chronicle, " run subtle humor and lenient judgment of human 
foibles which amuse the reader and leave him in benevolent frame towards 
the human kind." The Chicago Evening Post thinks that " for genuine 
humor, graceful wit, and a style full of subtle allusiveness, there has been 
nothing published for years like these essays."

FORTHCOMING APPLETON BOOKS 

Extinct Civilization of the West 

By ROBERT E. ANDERSON. 
A vivid narrative based upon the facts and traditions of the great races that 
peopled the American continent before the European settlement. Beginning 
with Plato's "Atlantis," Professor Anderson has gathered into a few brief and 
interesting chapters all that has been brought to light to support the theory 
of a pre-Columbian discovery of America. The Mound-Builders and the 
Indians are given adequate treatment, and the latter part of the book is taken 
up with an account of the great Aztec civilization, and the conquest of Mexico 
and Peru by Cortez and Pizarro and their followers.

IN APPLETONS' BUSINESS SERIES 

The Modern Bank 

By AMOS K. FISKE. 
Several books on the general principles of banking have been issued, but 
there is no volume which describes the methods by which business is done in 
the great banks of the present day. These methods have been so completely 
changed within the past decade as almost to have obliterated all considerable 
traces of methods that were universal twenty years ago, and Mr. Fiske's 
book is the first adequate treatment of the subject from the standpoint of the 
twentieth century.

HERBERT SPENCER. 



Herbert Spencer died at his borne in 
Brighton on the eighth of December, at the 
age of eighty-three — Goethe's age and Ten- 
nyson's, within a few months. He was prob- 
ably the greatest Englishman to outlive the 
century wnich he helped to make illustrious ; 
he was, indeed, one of the greatest of the 
world's thinkers, holding for his province a 
larger area of human thought than any other 
man of his time. His immense command of 
facts, and his power to deal with them in the 
philosophical spirit, made his figure more im- 



posing than that of Bacon, almost as imposing 
as that of Aristotle. 

Writing in our last issue of the Herder 
centenary, we spoke of the ideas of the great 
German who died one hundred years before 
Spencer as having "won such general accept- 
ance, and became so incorporated into the very 
fibre of our minds, that they seem to us com- 
monplaces of thought." We no longer read 
the writings, because their contents have be- 
come a part of our consciousness. Something 
similar will be said of Spencer a hundred years 
from now ; something not altogether dissimilar 
may be said of him at the present time, for in 
our day the world of thought moves on apace, 
and the assimilation of new ideas by the com- 
mon intelligence of the educated public is a 
far more rapid process than it was in the age 
of Herder. Even now people do not read 
Spencer in a measure proportional to his influ- 
ence upon them, and as the years go by, his 
books will become less and less the resort of 
students, although the ministry of his thought 
will not be lessened in like degree. For it 
must be admitted that, although he made the 
philosophy of style the subject of one of his 
minor studies, his own writings are not marked 
by the sort of style that makes literature out 
of prose composition, and have slight power to 
charm. They are imposing by their qualities 
of closely-marshalled logic and massive force, 
but they are, for the most part, without the 
power to attract. They attain at times, and 
particularly when the closing points of some 
weighty argument are reached, a certain grave 
dignity that is both impressive and memorable, 
but their general tenor is uninspiring as to 
form. They are of a kind with the writings of 
Aristotle rather than of Plato, of Kant rather 
than of Schopenhauer, of Locke rather than 
of Berkeley. 

The bracketing of Spencer's name with that 
of Aristotle is justified by the striking similar- 
ity that exists between the methods and achieve- 
ments of the two men. Both ranged over a 
considerable number of subjects, and sought to 
take the whole, or nearly the whole, of knowl- 
edge for their province. Both made vast 
collections of facts in various fields of investi- 
gation, and based their conclusions upon the 
most thoroughgoing processes of induction.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1> 



Both, having thus reached their conclusions in 
legitimate ways, proceeded to use them for the 
purposes of deductive application. Spencer 
was clearly a philosopher in the Aristotelian 
sense, but it is doubtful if we may call him a 
philosopher in the sense of Berkeley and Kant 
and Schopenhauer. Just twenty years ago, we 
ventured to suggest in these pages the view 
that, despite the philosophical temper of his 
thought, Spencer was not the creator of a system 
of philosophy in the commonly accepted mean- 
ing of that term, and to that view we must still 
adhere. He attempted a far-reaching synthesis 
of knowledge, to be sure, but it stops just short 
of what have always been held to be the essen- 
tial problems of philosophy, the examination 
of the grounds of knowledge, and the ultimate 
reality which underlies this world of appear- 
ance. Spencer frankly eschewed the whole 
philosophical problem, in the stricter sense, 
by relegating these matters to the category of 
the unknowable at the very start, and refusing 
thereafter to concern himself with them. Those 
opening pages of the "First Principles" are 
so hopelessly inadequate to their theme, and 
occupy a position so circumscribed by limita- 
tions resulting from the author's lack of ac- 
quaintance with philosophical thought and his 
unwillingness to march upon its central citadel, 
that they do not call for serious consideration. 

Having thus balked the whole question of 
ultimate reality, having deliberately restricted 
himself to the world of appearances as such, 
Spencer found himself on solid ground, and 
set himself the gigantic task of reducing to 
scientific order the phenomena of the physical 
universe, of the animate denizens of our sphere, 
and of man himself, in his threefold character 
as a thinking, social, and moral being. This 
is the scheme of the " Synthetic Philosophy " 
— first principles, biology, psychology, soci- 
ology, and ethics — ten volumes altogether, the 
product of half a century of unremitting intel- 
lectual effort, accomplished in the face of des- 
perate discouragements and seemingly insuper- 
able obstacles. A heroic task, done in the true 
heroic spirit, and signalizing by its successful 
issue the triumph of an indomitable purpose 
over physical frailty and public indifference. 

The dictum that " nature makes no leaps " 
had been floating about in the history of phi- 
losophy for many centuries, but it was not 
until the middle of the century just past that 
it was transformed into a working formula. 
For ages men had held it as a sort of pious 
opinion, and then — such being the illogical 



nature of the species — had gone on postu- 
lating the most surprising leaps in the develop- 
ment of the physical globe, in the succession 
of its plant and animal forms, and in the his- 
tory of the political and social institutions of 
mankind. Geological cataclysms, special crea- 
tions, and inexplicable revolutions in human 
thought and action had all been taken for 
granted for lack of insight into the underlying 
forces of progress, and upon that superficial 
and insecure basis a large part of the structure 
of human speculation had been reared. It is^ 
the imperishable glory of Spencer that he, first 
of thinking men, scattered all these easy as- 
sumptions to the winds by the power of syn- 
thetic vision fortified by unassailable logic. 
His was the mind that first formulated the 
law of evolution, and asserted its equal validity 
in the material, intellectual, and moral spheres. 
This magnificent conception took possession of 
his mind at an early age ; he gave the rest of 
his life to its working out and its rigorous^ 
application to all the major problems of thought 
(save only those metaphysical or transcen- 
dental problems which were deliberately ex- 
cluded from his purview) ; and so thoroughly 
did he accomplish his purpose that the term» 
of his thought are now the common possession 
of all thinking men, and even the unthinking 
are so constrained by them that, if they read 
Spencer at all, they are apt to wonder that so 
much credit should be attached to him for 
having said things so obvious ; that he should^ 
in the minds of any of the younger generation, 
lie under the reproach of a maker of platitudes, 
is, to students who view the history of thought 
in its historical perspective, the highest of all 
possible tributes to his achievement. 

The extensions of science in our own day 
are so vast as to prevent any one man from 
occupying completely more than one narrowly 
restricted field of knowledge. Even half a cen- 
tury ago, scientific investigation had become 
so broadened as to make Spencer's programme 
one seemingly impossible of execution by a^ 
single individual. And it is no doubt true 
that while he was working at the fundamental 
problems of physics, and biology, and psychol- 
ogy, there were in each of these fields many 
scholars of far minuter knowledge, and far 
wider acquaintance with details. Spencer made 
no first-hand studies of the earth's crust, he 
made no naturalist's voyages round the world 
in search of material, he organized no labora- 
tories of psychology. He dealt in the obser- 
vations of other men, and made few of his

THE DIAL 



own. But he had an incomparable power of 
marshalling facts, and of perceiving the unity 
underlying phenomena that were diverse in 
appearance, yet in his comprehensive survey 
clearly related. Even in the field of sociology, 
the science in which his work was most nearly 
of a pioneer character, and which he may fairly 
be said to have created, he gathered his facts 
from the reports of travellers and the books of 
historians, and classified them in his own study. 
In the domain of ethics alone he was practi- 
cally on even terms with his fellow-workers, 
for all the material necessary for a theory of 
morals are to be found in books, when the 
teachings of the books are supplemented by the 
lessons of such ordinary experience as comes 
to every one of us in the day's work. 

Was Spencer handicapped by this second- 
hand relation to most of the facts with which 
he dealt? Were his perceptions of things 
blunted because they came to him through the 
medium of other minds ? Did he suffer from 
being too much of a thinker and too little of 
an observer and experimentalist? These are 
questions that once seemed to have a certain 
point, and are from time to time still raised. 
It used to be asserted by those who would 
detract from his fame that the spokesmen of 
biology held him in great repute as a psychol- 
ogist, and that the spokesmen of psychology 
thought highly of him as a writer on biology, 
but that both made reservations in the matter 
of his authority in their own respective sci- 
ences. This sort of comment, which is no 
longer heard as frequently as it once was, 
might easily be counterbalanced by an array 
of tributes, all the way from Darwin to Pro- 
fessor Giddings, paid to Spencer by the most 
distinguished men of science for his contribu- 
tions to their own special fields of investiga- 
tion. But all such discussion seems rather 
futile, in view of the immense dignity which 
came to invest his closing years, and the almost 
universal acclaim given to the totality of his 
work as a thinker. Now that he is of those 
who " sit with their peers above the talk," we 
may pay due reverence to his memory even if 
we allow that the very sciences to which he 
was devoted have advanced beyond the stage 
which is embodied in his books. Whatever 
the new facts that have been disclosed by the 
laboratories since the publication of the " Bi- 
ology " and the " Psychology," and whatever 
new truths may be revealed by future investi- 
gation, the comprehensive law which was 
formulated by Spencer will hold good alike of 



the thoughts of men and the process of the suns. 
That is a point of view of which mankind has 
assumed permanent occupation, and with the 
assumption a great mass of pseudo-scientific 
speculation has been swept forever into the 
lumber-room of the past. 

To have fixed this conception in the very 
fabric of all rational thought is alone sufficient 
to mark the influence of Spencer as one of the 
most profound in the history of modern phi- 
losophy. It is a conception that will long con- 
tinue to bear fruit, particularly in those fields 
of inquiry that are concerned with man as a 
social and political being, as a responsible 
moral agent, and as a creature swayed by re- 
ligious emotion. It is in these fields that his 
work will continue to have inspiration for the 
twentieth century, and will help to mould the 
sociology, the ethics, and the religion of the 
coming generations. The conception of society 
as an organism, the evolutionary conception of 
conduct, which at last seems to point the way 
to a reconciliation between the hedonistic and 
idealistic views so long in conflict, the sublime 
eon3eption of an infinite and eternal energy 
from which all things proceed, compared with 
which the religious notions of the age of fable 
are seen in their true character as imaginings 
of the childhood of the race, — these are the 
ideas that the work of Spencer has implanted 
in the consciousness of men, and that his suc- 
ce.ssors — men of science, philosophical think- 
ers, and even poets — will eventually elaborate 
into systems and shapes of which only the 
adumbrations are now perceived. And as this 
evolution of thought goes on, illustrating anew 
his own law of integration combined with dif- 
ferentiation, the far-reaching grasp of his con- 
structive intellect will become more and more 
apparent. 

If we were asked what particular aspect of 
Spencer's social doctrine had the most impor- 
tant bearing upon the present needs of civili- 
zation we should point to that unremitting in- 
sistence upon individualism which characterized 
his work all the way from the " Social Statics " 
of 1850 to the "Facts and Comments" of over 
half a century later. His closing years were 
greatly disheartened by the ever-increasing ten- 
dency of our modern societies to depart from 
this saving doctrine ; and those who know even 
in outline what the history of civilization has 
been, and how hard the struggle to free individ- 
ual initiative from the trammels of tradition 
and social pressure, may well share in the dis- 
couragement of the philosopher. For it seems 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1^ 



to many of us that civilization is recklessly 
throwing away the most precious part of its 
birthright, and that it is harking backward to 
the regime of status from which it emerged into 
vital activity only after ages of stagnation. The 
rising tide of socialism is interfering with con- 
tract on every hand, and the multiplication of 
governmental functions is everywhere encroach- 
ing upon the rights of the individual citizen. 
How clearly Spencer perceived these dangers, 
and how strenuously he sought to meet them, is 
evidenced by the writings of his later years, 
and particularly by the weighty warnings of his 
essays on " Man vs. the State." This part of 
his teaching is sadly discredited at the present 
time ; some day it will be discovered that this 
was the part best worth heeding. He prob- 
ably went too far in his protest against the 
supplanting of individual by social action, but 
a tendency to err in that direction would be less 
ominous to the interests of civilization than 
the opposite tendency which now offers such 
a menace to the future. " Back to Kant " 
has been of recent years a potent watchword 
among philosophers ; we look forward to the 
time when "Back to Spencer " will be the cry 
among men concerned with social and political 
science, when statesmen and reformers, disillu- 
sionized by many failures, will cease attempt- 
ing to make men wise and upright by external 
pressure, and will realize that the best gov- 
ernment is the one that confines itself to the 
restraining of evil impulses and the creating of 
an environment of equal opportunity for free 
individual action. When that time comes, the 
name of Herbert Spencer will be held in higher 
honor than ever before.

A FAMOUS JAPANESE NOVELIST. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Japan has recently lost one of its foremost literati in 
the person of Mr. Ozaki, better known by his nom-de- 
plume of " Koyo Sanjin." He shares with Professor 
Tsubouchi the honor of having introduced the modern 
style of novel-writing in Japan. The older novels were 
written in ornate classical style, and were very difficult 
to understand. But the modern school of fiction-writers, 
following European models, make their characters speak 
in common colloquial. 

" Koyo " died of cancer of the stomach at the early 
age of 37. He had spent three years in youth in the 
Imperial University, but could not graduate, because, 
" his mind even then being filled with romautic ideas," 
he could not pass examinations in science! But it is 
stated that " the unscientific answers that he did write 
astonished the faculty by their literary skill! " 



In addition to his proficiency as a novelist, he was 
also an adept in the composition of the seventeen- 
syllable ode known as haikwai. On his death-bed he 
composed the following lines, to which we append com- 
ments by the editor of the "Japan Mail ": 
^^ Shinaba aki 
Ttuyu no hinu ma zo 
Omoshiroki." 
"This vepselet is an admirable example of Japanese im- 
pressionist poetry. Freely rendered it reads, ' Let me die in 
autumn before the dew dries'; words which recall, though 
they do not express, the familiar idea of the dew-drop evan- 
escence of life in Buddhist eyes, and of the shining of night- 
pearls on the petals of the autumn flower, the morning glory, 
' The dew-drop slips ioto the silent sea.' " 

Just before Ozaki's death, he urged a group of hi» 
disciples "to cooperate loyally and strive to rise still 
higher in their profession." He also said: "Had I 
seven lives to live, I would devote them all to litera- 
ture." Ernest W. Clement. 

Tokyo, Japan, December 3, 1903. 



TOTEM NAMES. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Professor Starr asks, in a review of my " Social Ori- 
gins " (The Dial, November 1), "are 'hide- scrapers' 
and * dung-eaters ' really totem-names, used and recog- 
nized by the [Sioux] totem-members themselves ? " Of 
course they are not totem-names ; totem-names do exist 
among the Sioux, but are yielding place, as I remark, 
to local names, such as " High Village." The derisive 
sobriquets, " hide-scrapers " and so on, are no doubt 
" recognized " by the persons thus designated, but Pro- 
fessor Starr has better opportunities than I of learning 
whether they are " used " by them. Probably not: the 
Eskimo (" eaters of raw meat ") speak of themselves 
as " Innuit," " the men." The animal names of village 
groups in Europe are also " recognized " by the people 
designated, and I have heard a person gleefully pro- 
claim himself a frog. But, in the case of genuine 
totem-names among savages, there is nothing neces- 
sarily derisive, there may even be compliment, in the 
animal names, which, like death, " are not an evil, be- 
cause they are universal." My argument is that, in 
such circumstances, savages have become " proud of 
the title, as the Living Skeleton said ven they showed 
him." There is nothing contrary to human nature in 
this opinion. Great parties, as Whig and Tory, have 
proudly adopted sobriquets of the meanest and most 
derisive origin; whereas animal names, in savage so- 
ciety, contain nothing necessarily derisive, and are 
notoriously the most common of personal names of in- 
dividuals. My lists of actual group-sobriquets, among 
the Sioux, in Orkney, Scotland, France, England (I may 
add Crete and Guernsey), are merely illustrative of the 
tendency to give and use group sobriquets. In " the 
dark backward and abyss " of the savage past, — given 
savage ideas of the supernatural superiority of animals 
to man, — such names, though originally sobriquets^ 
might readily, in course of ages, be adopted by the 
groups to which they were applied. If this did occur, 
the rise of totemistic myths and rites was inevitable. 
Professor Starr will note that the village sobriquets 
have a wider range than England, including, it seems 
possible, ancient Palestine; and perhaps, when once 
attention is drawn to the subject, such sobriquets will 
be found to exist in Europe generally. The point has 
not, to my knowledge, been examined. A. Lang.

The Sixties as Seen by Justin 
McCarthy.* 



It is no feeling of idle curiosity that in- 
spires our interest in the accounts of a past 
time from one who has been acquainted with 
some of its leading men. So says Mr. McCarthy 
in closing his volume entitled " Portraits of the 
Sixties," in which he pictures with graphic pen 
many of the illustrious characters he had the 
pleasure of knowing personally in that eventful 
decade. The great names we associate with the 
England of 1860-70 would make a long cata- 
logue. Two of the greatest of her novelists, 
Dickens and Thackeray, died within that 
period ; Carlyle and Tennyson were at their 
best ; Swinburne was coming into notice ; 
Ddnte Gabriel Rossetti's poetical career be- 
gan ; Gladstone and Disraeli, Cobden and 
Bright were prominent in the political world ; 
and Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley, and Spencer 
commanded the attention of men of science. 
Events, too, of national and of international 
importance helped to render that decade a 
memorable one and to make the portraits of its 
chief men by so much the more worth pre- 
serving. 

A matter which at first might seem of small 
significance, but which is big with meaning to 
him to whom nothing human is alien, is amus- 
ingly touched upon by Mr. McCarthy in his 
introductory chapter. 

" It is well for the early sixties that they had so 
mauy splendid claims to hi»toiical recollection, but it 
may be said of them that if they had bequeathed no 
other memory to a curious and contemplative posterity, 
the reign of crinoline would still have secured for them 
an abiding-place in the records of human eccentricities. 
I may say without fear of contradiction, that no one 
who was not living at the time can form any adequate 
idea of the grotesque fffect produced on the outer 
aspects of social life by this article of feminine costume. 
. . . A whole new school of satirical humor was devoted 
in vain to the ridicule of crinoline. The boys in the 
street sang comic songs to make fun of it, but no street 
bellowings of contempt could incite the wearers of this 
most inconvenient and hideous article of dress to con- 
demn themselves to clinging draperies. Crinoline, too, 
created a new sort of calamity all its own. Every day's 
papers gave us fresh accounts of what were called crin- 
oline accidents — cases, that is to say, in which a woman 
was seriously burned or burned to death because of some 
flame of fire or candle catching her distended drapery 
at some unexpected moment. ... A woman getting

into or out of a carriage, an omnibus, or a train, making 
her way through a crowded room, or entering into the 
stalls of a theatre was a positive nuisance to all with 
whom she had to struggle for her passage." 

Still stronger terms might have been used to 
describe the influence of this monstrous fashion. 
Crossing the Channel, we find the church rev- 
enues of France falling off alarmingly because 
of the fewer chairs that could be let to hoop- 
skirted women, one such inflated worshipper 
filling the space formerly occupied by three of 
her sex. As a result, the charge per chair had 
to be raised. 

The author's portraits of statesmen and ora- 
tors are especially good. He has a keen relish 
for able public speaking and debating, and his 
judgment is so discriminating that he enables 
the reader to see how each one of a group of 
great orators is preeminent in his kind. For 
Cobden and Bright his admiration is enthu- 
siastic. An interesting speculation is indulged 
in regarding the result that might have followed 
Cobden's acceptance of the place he rejected 
in Palmerston's cabinet about the time our civil 
war broke out. With his thorough knowledge 
of America and Americans, with his ardent ad- 
vocacy of negro freedom, and with the Queen's 
sympathies on the side of the North, would he 
have been able to make head against Palmer- 
ston's pro-Southern policy and thus have 
averted the Alabama troubles ? Probably not, 
says our author ; yet it is not unreasonable to 
think it might have been. The portrait pre- 
sented of John Bright is most attractive. Mr. 
McCarthy's admiration of him as an orator, as 
a statesman, and as a man, is unreserved. He 
held him as superior in oratory to Gladstone — 
an opinion that once made Bright himself 
positively angry, so modest was the latter's 
estimate of himself, and so hearty his admira- 
tion for Gladstone. A short passage from the 
book will place Bright before us in one phase 
at least of his pleasing personality. It also 
illustrates anew the old truth that humor is akin 
to love, that the genuine humorist is always a 
person of kind heart and of large charity to- 
ward his enemies. 

" Bright was a master of genuine Saxon humor. Some 
of his unprepared replies to the interruptions of political 
opponents in the House of Commons were marvellous 
examples of this faculty, and are frequently quoted 
even now in speeches and in newspaper articles. But 
there was nothing whatever of levity in Bright's humor, 
and his most effective satirical touches seemed as if 
they were intended rather to rouse into better judgment 
than to wound or offend the man at whom they were 
directed. I think the one defect which Bright could 



10 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



not fully forgive in any man was want of sincerity. I 
have heard him again and again iu private conversation 
enter into the defence of some extreme political oppo- 
nent on the ground that the opponent, however mistaken, 
aggressive, and even unjust, was acting in accordance 
with his sincere convictions. I can remember many 
instances in which Bright strongly objected to certain 
criticisms appearing in the newspaper representing his 
own political creed, on the ground that they were not 
quite fair and would be likely to give pain." 

An incidental mention of the tariff question 
leads the author to declare that, as no "subtlety 
of plausible argument will ever induce England 
to return to what used to be called the principle 
of divine right in government," so there is 
" just as little reason to fear that any such 
argument can prevail upon her to make at this 
time of day a reactionary experiment in the 
way of protective tariffs." Let us hope he may 
not prove a false prophet. 

The author's acquaintance with Dickens, 
Thackeray, Carlyle, and numerous other men 
of letters, supplies him with a fund of enter- 
i;aining reminiscence concerning books and 
writers. It was Dickens's amazing versatility 
that most impressed him in contemplating the 
man, and he sets before us this quality iu a way 
that will impress even those that thought them- 
selves already acquainted with the great nov- 
elist. Strikingly in contrast with Dickens's 
portrait is that of Thackeray, of whom also Mr. 
McCarthy was a cordial admirer. In present- 
ing the physical man Thackeray, the portrait- 
painter has somewhat blurred his picture by 
representing him on one page as having eyes 
that "never gave out the penetrating flash-lights 
which Dickens could turn upon those around 
him," and on another as having eyes that 
" beamed with a penetrating light even through 
the spectacles." The charm of Thackeray's 
public readings, or lectures, is thus recalled : 

" Thackeray had, indeed, none of the superbly dra- 
matic style of delivery which made Dickens's readings 
and speeches so impressive. His voice was clear and 
penetrating and his articulation allowed no word to be 
lost upon his listeners, but he never seemed to be mak- 
ing any direct appeal to the emotion of the audience. 
No accompaniment of gesture set off his quiet intona- 
tion, and he seemed, indeed, to be talking rather at 
than to the crowd which hung upon his every word. 
... I observed on many occasions that the audience 
seemed to become possessed by a common dread lest 
anything, even an outburst of premature applause, 
should interrupt the discourse and cause a word to be 
lost. I noticed this especially in some of the more 
pathetic passages, as, for instance, in the closing sen- 
tences of the lecture on George the Third — that mar- 
vellous description of the blind, deaf, and insane old 
king as he wandered through the halls of his palace 



and bewailed to himself the deplorable conditions of his 
closing days. The most studied dramatic effects of 
voice and action could not have given to those passages 
of the lecture a more complete and absorbing command 
over the feelings of the listening crowd. Every one 
appeared to hold his breath in fear that even a sound 
of admiration might disturb for an instant the calm 
flow of that thrilling discourse. ... I have heard 
many great orators and lecturers in my time and in 
various countries, and I never made one of an audience 
which seemed to hang upon the words of the speaker 
more absolutely." 

Mr. McCarthy's acquaintance with celeb- 
rities has been of the widest. Artists, actors, 
scholars, philanthropists, travellers — anyone 
of marked individuality is a congenial subject 
for his pen. A striking contrast is that of Sir 
Richard Burton, as depicted before his mar- 
riage, and the same man after woman's gentle 
influence had subdued and refined him. Here 
is Burton before he had bent his neck to the 
conjugal yoke : 

" He was quick in his movements, rapid in his talk, 
never wanted for a word or an argument, was impatient 
of differing opinion, and seemingly could not help mak- 
ing himself the dictator of any assembly in which he 
found himself a centre figure. His powers of descrip- 
tion were marvellous ; he could dash off picturesque 
phrases as easily as another man could utter common- 
places; could tell any number of good stories without 
ever seeming to repeat himself; could recite a poem or 
rattle off a song, could flash out jest after jest, some- 
times with bewildering meanings; be was always per- 
fectly good-humored, and he was always indomitably 
dogmatic. If he thought you really worth arguing with 
on any question which especially concerned him, he 
would apply himself to the argument with as much 
earnestness as if some great issue depended on it, and 
with an air of sublime superiority which seemed to 
imply that he was keeping up the discussion, not because 
there could be any doubt as to the right side, but merely 
out of a kindly resolve to enlighten your ignorance 
whether you would or not." 

The Burton of later days was " kindly, consid- 
erate, patient of other men's opinions, ready to 
put the best construction on other men's mo- 
tives, unwilling to wound"; and this change 
was wrought by "the sweet and gentle influ- 
ence of that woman whose very eyes told the 
love and devotion which she felt for him, and 
the tenderness with which she applied herself 
to bring out all that was best in him." 

Most excellent are the accounts of Thorold 
Rogers and Professor Goldwin Smith. Our 
civil war being mentioned in connection with 
the latter's hearty espousal of the cause of 
negro freedom, Mr, McCarthy, who was him- 
self emphatically on the side of the North in 
the great dispute, refers to the division it 
caused among his countrymen. " The majority

of that class which we describe as society," he 
writes, " took the side of the South, while the 
best intellects of England in politics, litera- 
ture, and science, and the whole mass of the 
English working population adhered to and 
advocated the cause of the North." Surely, he 
has here, in a moment of forgetfulness, given 
the " best intellects " more than due credit. 
Gladstone, Carlyle, Martineau, to name no 
others, were of Southern sympathies. The list 
could doubtless be considerably extended. 

The author's love of music and the drama 
prompts him to furnish many a pleasing por- 
trait from the stage. In describing that excel- 
lent comedian, Robert Keeley, he commends 
especially the thoroughly wholesome nature of 
his fun, and humorously adds : " The most scru- 
pulous daughter might have safely taken her 
mother to enjoy any of Keeley's performances, 
and the good lady might have laughed her fill 
over his looks and his utterances without any 
dread of a censorious world." Here, as else- 
where, the writer's style is a delight to the 
reader, being easy, fluent, enlivened with hu- 
mor and warmed with kindliness, happy in its 
choice of the right word, and passing from topic 
to topic in easy transition and sufficiently rapid 
succession. One more quotation must be made 
to show the author's command of descriptive 
epithet. Sir Richard Bethell, afterward Baron 
Westbury, made a name for himself in the 
House of Commons as a master of corrosive 
sarcasm. His peculiar style of parliamentary 
retort is thus described: 

" Bethell's way was to let his eyelids droop as if he 
were affected by a sudden access of shyness, just as he 
was about to pour out on some opponent in debate his 
most yitriolic sarcasm, and to deliver this sarcasm in 
tones of dulcet gentleness, as if he were paying a deli- 
cate compliment by which he hoped to endear himself 
further to its recipient. He had a clear, impressive 
voice, and could speak powerfully whenever he thought 
fit, but he was sure to adopt the cadences of bewitching 
blanduess whenever he seized on the chance of making 
his opponent an object for the ridicule of the House. 
. . . When Bethell, with half-closed eyes, head mod- 
estly bent, and mild and gentle tones, poured gently 
out his phrases of vitriolic scorn, the listener felt that 
a new and cruel charm came in to make the contempt 
all the more withering to its object and more intensely 
amusing to the audience." 

The pictures that thus vividly appeal to 
the eye of reason are reinforced with abundant 
portraits addressed to the eye of sense, the 
whole making as entertaining a volume as one 
need ask for on a winter's evening.

London on London,* 



In the summer of 1902, Mr. Jack London, 
of California, undertook to explore the recesses 
of the British metropolis. What he saw, heard, 
and did, he has set forth in a volume of over 
three hundred pages, with numerous illustra- 
tions. The account he gives is a straight- 
forward one, and there is no reason why it 
should not be accepted at its face-value, — the 
broad facts, indeed, being already too familiar 
to those who have lived in London. 

I had just finished reading the book, and 
was feeling very kindly toward its enthusiastic 
young author, when my eye fell on an adver- 
tisement of it ("Science," Nov. 13), which 
ran as follows : 

" Mr. Jack London's New Book. ' As thrilling as 
the best of his fiction.' . . . An account of the labor 
and life of the London slums — of the conditions of 
poverty, degradation, and suffering in the East End. 
It tingles with all the vitality of his fiction, and is full 
of such vivid realism as is only possible from a man who 
knows London as Mr. Jacob A. Riis knows New York." 

Putting aside the absurdity of comparing the 
author's knowledge of London with Mr. Riis's 
of New York, we cannot feel otherwise than 
indignant at the manifest suggestion that the 
misery of the East End will afford such amuse- 
ment to those in more fortunate circumstances 
that its recital is equivalent to " the best of his 
fiction." Sixteen years ago, William Morris 
fulminated against the well-to-do people who 
amused themselves by ^' sentimentalising the 
sordid lives of the miserable peasants of Italy 
and the starving proletarians of her towns, 
now that all the picturesqueness has departed 
from the poor devils of our own country-side, 
our own slums," — but he did not know that 
even these last could be made a source of 
entertainment, given a clever showman. 

I am willing to believe — indeed, I do be- 
lieve — that the advertisement cited does Mr. 
London a great injustice. He can hardly be 
blamed for having produced a readable and 
interesting book, nor can he be expected to 
wish it other than a large circulation ; but if 
he is as sincere and as earnest a reformer as 
we judge him to be, he will doubtless be disap- 
pointed as he comes to realize the true character 
of its reception. Yet in time he will find that his 
seed has sprouted in unexpected places, and the 
harvest will be tardily but surely gathered in. 

It is neither possible nor desirable, within

the limits of a review, to give any account of 
Mr. London's experiences ; but it is worth 
while to quote his comparison of the English 
with the Alaskan Indians, since he knows both 
at first-hand, and the latter are recognized as 
among the least favored races of mankind. 

" In Alaska, along the banks of the Yukon River, 
near its mouth, live the Innuit folk. They are a very 
primitive people, manifesting but mere glimmering 
adumbrations of that tremendous artifice, Civilization. 
Their capital amounts possibly to $10 per head. They 
hunt and fish for their food with bone-headed spears and 
arrows. They never suffer from lack of shelter. Their 
clothes, largely made from the skins of animals, are 
warm. They always have fuel for their fires, likewise 
timber for their houses, which they build partly under- 
ground, and in which they lie snugly during the periods 
of intense cold. In the summer they live in tents, open 
to every breeze, and cool. They are healthy [when they 
do not catch some disease of civilization, the author 
might have said], and strong, and happy. Their one 
problem is food. They have their times of plenty and 
times of famine. In good times they feast; in bad times 
they die of starvation. But starvation, as a chronic con- 
dition, present with a large number of them all the time, 
is a thing unknown. Further, they have no debts. 

" In the United Kingdom, on the rim of the Western 
Ocean, live the English folk. They are a consummately 
civilized people. Their capital amounts to at least 
$1600 per head. They gain their food, not by hunting 
and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices. For the 
most part, they suffer from lack of shelter. The greater 
number of them are vilely housed, do not have enough 
fuel to keep them warm, and are insufBciently clothed. 
A constant number never have any bouses at all, and 
sleep shelterless under the stars. Many are to be found, 
winter and summer, shivering on the streets in their rags. 
They have good times and bad. In good times most of 
them manage to get enough to eat, in bad times they die 
of starvation. They are dying now, they were dying 
yesterday and last year, they will die tomorrow and next 
year, of starvation; for they, unlike the Innuit, suffer 
from a chronic condition of starvation. There are 
40,000,000 of the English folk, and 939 out of every 
1000 of them die in poverty, while a constant army of 
8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation. 
Further, each babe that is born is born in debt to the 
$um of $110. This is because of an artifice called the 
National Debt" (pp. 311-313). 

This is strongly put, but perhaps the worst 
part of it all is left unmentioned. The Innuit 
people are living, I suppose, nearly as well as 
their nature permits ; but the English are 
stunted and warped, so that what they become 
bears no resemblance to what they might have 
been. Mr. London discusses the rapid dete- 
rioration of the breed in the midst of the city, 
— so rapid that the urban population would 
disappear in a few generations, were it not 
replenished from the rural districts. He does 
not, perhaps, sufficiently distinguish between 
the inferiority due to birth and that due to 
environment. It is a comforting doctrine to 



some, that the poor are so because of their 
natural inferiority. It need not be doubted 
that the two things often go together ; but it 
has been well shown that the children of the 
poor, removed to better surroundings, will ex- 
hibit undreamed of abilities. On page 309 of 
Mr. London's book is given proof of this ; for it 
appears that Dr. Barnardo has picked up from 
the streets of London and sent abroad 13 340 
boys, most of them to Canada, and not one in 
fifty has failed. That is to say, that the very 
breed and race which is complacently said to 
have dug its own grave in the East End of Lon- 
don is capable of great success, given reason- 
ably favorable circumstances. If it could be 
shown that the Abyss only swallowed up the 
worthless, even then we should deserve the 
utmost condemnation for our inhumanity in 
the manner of their destruction ; but when 
it appears that it is a great machine for the 
cutting-off of the English in the fulness of their 
strength — this is "race suicide" indeed! 

Mr. London does not despair of the English. 
As an American, he knows the blood too well 
to do that. But, says he, " the political ma- 
chine known as the British Empire is running 
down." Just what he understands by this 
phrase is not wholly apparent. If he supposes 
that the things he describes are the result of 
any purely "political" conditions, the fact of 
similar things existing in every great civilized 
country, not excepting the United States, 
should convince him to the contrary. How- 
ever, in many places throughout the book he 
speaks distinctly and emphatically of the social 
injustice which is the real cause of the evil, — 
and it is only fair to understand his use of the 
term political in this light, meaning, as the 
word properly means, the whole management 
of civilization. 

Whatever meaning the dreadful recital of 
English conditions may have for England, it 
has precisely the same meaning for America. 
Our author's fair State of California has al- 
ready its San Francisco, and with the increase 
of " prosperity " resulting from transpacific 
commerce the western shores may yet become 
the scene of worse things than he has known. 
If it is to be otherwise, it must be because the 
people of the West, wiser in their generation, 
set themselves to prevent it. And it may be 
that the resistance offered to the extension of 
white slavery will bring about the freedom of 
those already in bondage ; for thus does history 
repeat itself. ^_ ^^ ^^ Cockerell.

THfi Course and LiAws of Empire.* 

It is difficult, at first glance, to say whether 
Mr. Brooks Adams's book on ''The New Em- 
pire " is written by a journalist or by a serious 
thinker of the most progressed school of eco- 
nomic theorists. At first, the easy, rushing 
style, and the attempt to hammer into the 
reader's consciousness in short energetic phrases 
the ideas which the writer looks upon as all- 
important, suggests newspaper writing of the 
superior type. Yet upon second thought we see 
that this electric " up to date " mode of expres- 
sion covers a cosmic idea of vast magnitude and 
scientific directness ; and that this rapid sur- 
vey, this literary railroading toward the goal, 
presents after all a stately array of facts for the 
support of the truly Darwinian doctrine that 
" man's destiny must ultimately depend upon 
his flexibility." The question is whether this 
method is not too business-like to be altogether 
fair, too hasty to be safe. The vastness of the 
problem Mr. Adams purposes to discuss in the 
"New Empire," and the apparent waywardness 
of the hypothesis which he offers as its solution, 
seem at first sight too disproportionate. The 
problem set forth is the familiar puzzle, familiar 
from countless histories of civilization, why the 
seat of the world's power and of empires has 
constantly moved from east to west, from south 
to north, until it has gone half-way around the 
globe and has lately established itself in the 
New World. 

In explanation of this, Mr. Adams offers 
not merely the time-worn lullaby concerning 
the mysterious successive calls of God to the 
nations to bear the burden of wealth and civili- 
zation, or the newer and more substantiated 
one of the movement of trade, and accordingly 
of power, from one commercial centre to an- 
other, as the trade-routes change and competi- 
tors arise for the precious possession. Mr. 
Adams's special and pet theory goes further 
than these, and declares such change in the 
seat of empire to depend solely on nearness to 
or possession of an abundant supply of food 
and other necessaries, and also a sufficient 
supply of the useful metals for defense or for 
medium of exchange. These means of wealth 
exhausted, the centre of trade, of communica- 
tion and centralization, moves on to a more 
suitable location, lodges with another nation, 
settles within another sphere of labor. 

To say that this theory is ingenious is very

mild praise ; it has the character of true in- 
sight into the elemental causes of human 
activity. For what can be truer in its simple 
potency than the statement at the beginning 
of the book, often repeated but always equally 
impressive in its directness, that as self-pre- 
servation is the predominant instinct in man, 
80 he must procure food by cunning or by 
violence ; that demand for food leads to inter- 
course, to trade, to war ; that intercourse of 
whatever kind always follows the easiest path, 
where transportation is cheapest ; in fine, that 
food and means of defense constitute man's 
chief economic necessities upon which the de- 
velopment of power and civilization depends. 

But with the possession of wealth comes also 
the possibility of controlling the destiny of 
other nations, of grasping the world's trade and 
dictating to the customer. This possibility, 
however, is based on the power of organization, 
on centralized energy and prevention of waste. 
Hence the importance, for doing business on a 
large scale, of combinations of capital and en- 
slavement of labor, such as the negotiatores of 
Rome and the trusts of to-day. Mr. Adams 
is modern enough to take into account this ele- 
ment of competition from the very start. Ac- 
cording to his idea, it was not merely present 
but omnipresent in the rise to preeminence of 
ancient Baktra and Samarkand no less than 
to-day, and regulated the world's commerce in 
a manner a thousand times more intricate than 
the casual observer imagines. Not upon the 
sword, but in the last instance upon the power 
to underbid chance competitors in the world's 
market, rests the opportunity of a country to 
rise to a commanding position and exercise 
control over other countries, even to the ex- 
tent of making them its dependencies. Hence, 
as the world is constituted, comes the rise of 
all world-empires, such as the Babylonian, the 
Assyrian, Grecian, Roman, Great Britain, and 
Greater Russia. This last New Empire of the 
United States is due to economic supremacy 
rather than to political, to the presence of 
abundant supply, rapid and cheap exchange of 
commodities, and, last but not least, to a 
highly centralized mode of production which 
can serve all at the smallest expenditure. And 
this is the reason that Mr. Adams thinks the 
trusts an economic necessity, without which 
America could not have secured her present 
commercial supremacy. The function of gov- 
ernment in this formation of imperial power is 
to ease the process, not to retard nor for any 
dogmatic reason hinder it. Government is 



14

[Jan. 1, 



nothing but the tool to promote the welfare of 
the people; hence if it proves obstructive to 
commercial enterprise and industrial expansion 
it may fatally injure the growth of power and 
thus the material success of the nation, and 
may itself perish in the struggle. Whether 
President Roosevelt would be sufficiently con- 
vinced by this reasoning to abandon as futile 
his attempt at trust legislation, there is no way 
of telling ; but Mr. Adams's " warning voice " 
might well make him hesitate. 

Evidently Mr. Adams is altogether oblivious 
of such antiquated religious survivals as the 
notion of right and wrong in the wholesale 
destruction of small industries ; nor is the 
political shibboleth of individuals being free 
and equal of any account in his view of the 
onward march of economic conditions. He has 
stated once before that he does not believe in 
the influence of ideas upon the destiny of na- 
tions. They obey far more an instinct, and 
instead of being free agents are but subservient 
atoms in the whirl of energy. Hence Mr. 
Adams wastes no time upon theological white- 
washing of the mighty or the cruel deeds of 
man. They were actuated by a force greater 
than their conscience or their civilization. 
"Nature" is the all- encompassing power which 
stands behind and plays fast and loose with 
all man's petty rules, gives him his chance, 
or withdraws it if he is not ready to seize it. 
Mr. Adams sees the evidence of Nature's in- 
tentions in the rise and fall of nations and of 
empires. He appears to us a pantheist of the 
school of Positivists, — or should we simply call 
him a disciple of the doctrine of environment 
after the manner of Demoulins ? 

But however bold in his assertions, and free 
from the restrictions of moral and religious 
precepts, there is no need of quarrelling with 
Mr. Adams because of his views. To have 
opinions, however startling, about life, or man, 
or Nature, is an author's prerogative, and may 
serve him as a recommendation rather than 
otherwise. The thing one can quarrel with 
Mr. Adams about is his method. The means 
which he sets forth more or less emphatically, 
as preferable for acquiring the true under- 
standing of history and accordingly of the 
meaning of man's destiny, is frankly to aban- 
don the bewildering and wasteful German mode 
of ascertaining the truth by the study of detail, 
and instead to seek only for the large and plain 
lines of development. From these it is the stu- 
dent's duty to discover and construe the uni- 
versal law which governs life and which is the 



only profitable thing for people to know. That 
this law is in itself an uncommonly hard and 
dreary thing, that it is constantly the same, and 
hence wearisome in its monotony, makes no 
difference. The profit of discovery is worth 
the effort, and Mr. Adams experiences genuine 
joy and pride from it. When this law is dis- 
covered, the next thing of importance is to 
gather the facts which best illustrate the work- 
ing of the principle, to put them into their 
proper relation and let them speak for them- 
selves — Mr. Adams in this particular case 
remaining passive. But this passivity which 
he claims seems to be only a pleasant make- 
believe ; the very act of generalization which 
the author advocates as the correct method, and 
employs all through, seems to us to be eminently 
his own active way of discovering the particular 
principle he is after ; whereas the theories pro- 
mulgated seem decidedly the cause rather than 
the effect of the manner in which the facts have 
unfolded themselves to bis mind. 

No one goes to the work of a generalization 
of this kind without the idea he wishes corro- 
borated plainly in his mind. Hence the reader 
is almost of necessity forced to accuse the 
author of artfully trying to pass off as inno- 
cence what is only feigned indifference. Mr. 
Adams, indeed, in his preface and elsewhere, 
makes a great point of the necessity of general- 
ization as the only means by which logical 
connection can be found between isolated facts. 
He makes a desperate and even angry attack 
on research work as being futile because so 
largely done for its own sake. We are nothing 
loth to see the importance of synthesis brought 
to the fore in public discussion, after such long 
and ardent harangues about the unrivalled ad- 
vantages of analysis. But it may be permitted 
to say that of the two methods discussed by 
Mr. Adams generalization is certainly the one 
which least insures sound training or keen his- 
torical judgment. Only the master of method, 
the ripened thinker, the thorough scholar, and 
scarcely even they, can generalize without foist- 
ing upon the world some half-truth or making 
their readers victims of their personal bias. 

Of course Mr. Adams points to the necessity 
of reasoning on a scientific basis, from cause to 
effect, along the lines of physical and biological 
truths already accepted. But the habit of apply- 
ing scientific rules to philosophic facts is still 
so new, so little has been done to establish even 
approximately the true connection between the 
two, that almost any theory may be forwarded, 
generalization reign supreme, and no criterion

be found by which to test the soundness of the 
conclusions arrived at. The data of history, 
especially of the far past, are too pliant a mate- 
rial not to fit almost any doctrine. The ques- 
tion is only how to pick one's examples and 
cover them with the necessary quantity of plau- 
sible commentary. The public is altogether 
too fond of generalizations that have the sem- 
blance of common-sense not to be indulged in 
the amplest way on every platform and for 
every purpose. In fact, unless extreme care is 
exercised we shall soon find ourselves in a maze 
of generalization from which only the axe of 
patient research (not for its own sake) can 
deliver us. Hence at the present juncture 
Mr. Adams's passionate demand for general- 
ization sounds somewhat preposterous. 

Although the author in his book really lives 
up to his idea, as far as his idiosyncracies per- 
mit, and gives perhaps the soundest and best 
balanced treatment of history on a large plan 
that his method warrants, yet his advice con- 
cerning future study of history must be taken 
largely cum grano salis. However interesting 
and suggestive his own work, his method may 
easily lead to the blatant superficiality which is 
the horror of the conscientious student. Mr. 
Adams himself perceives the danger to which 
his reasoning may expose both his book and the 
idea it represents, and he offers both, not as a 
finished theory, but as a hypothesis for medi- 
tation by the enlightened and thoughtful. But 
a full-fledged suggestion, when eloquently put, 
is often more influential in turning men's 
thoughts than the accepted theory which is 
already somewhat brittle and worn. 

The rather uncompromising Positivism of 
our author is perhaps best shown in the state- 
ment on page 196 : ''Nature abhors the weak." 
To us it seems that Nature has good use for the 
weak no less than for the strong, and in her 
minute economy wastes no material, not even 
the apparently most contemptible. Indeed, we 
are inclined to state, with a well-known econ- 
omist, that without the weak the strong would 
not be ; the strong rest on the support of the 
weak, both are necessary, hence Nature employs 
both. And pray what in the merciless order of 
"Nature" constitutes strength but a momentary 
advantage ? If the old scholastic subservience 
to certain pet phrases (of scientific color but 
speculative origin) could be eliminated from 
late philosophic literature, there would be more 
soundness and fewer fads. The survival of the 
fittest is a theorem almost done to death in all 
popular speculation, but what this mysterious 



fitness really stands for in the subtle household 
of Nature still remains to be seen. 

Mr. Adams's book is unquestionably a very 
courageous and interesting attempt at solving 
the problem of transmission of energy in the 
world's development from one centre of activity 
to another. It is suggestive of much keen obser- 
vation, incessant study, and logical combination 
of facts. It certainly presents a much more 
thorough cooperation of philosophic and scien- 
tific method than commonly prevails. But it 
nevertheless strongly suggests the same old 
necessity of careful study of detail, in order 
that if generalization on a large scale is hence- 
forth to be the order in American liberal 
education, the facts shall truly support the 
conclusion, and that synthesis in all its generous 
breadth shall be upheld in the basic particulars 
by a stout and reliable analysis.

For LiOVers of R. Zt. S.* 



There are certain of our literary passions 
(to borrow Mr. Howells's phrase) that have in 
their composition a curious admixture of jeal- 
ousy. The Borrovians, for example, remain 
more than content that their author should be 
without honor in the form of popularizing ar- 
ticles in the literary journals ; and lovers of the 
FitzGerald of the Letters do not welcome the 
uncountable pocket copies of the " Rubaijat." 
Mr. J. A. Hammerton, the compiler of " Steven- 
soniana," is not likely, however, to find himself 
offending any such sentiment, for the most 
bookish among Stevenson's admirers have 
never regretted his appeal to the unliterary 
reading public. Nor need the relevance of the 
book, which is announced as a " miscellany of 
anecdote and criticism, inscribed to the lovers 
of the man and admirers of the artist R. L. S. 
the world over," be questioned. That element 
in the Scottish character which complements 
the traditional reserve was sufficiently strong 
in Stevenson to absolve the editor of any such 
volume from the charge of impertinence. 
We have cause for gratitude in the fact that 
Stevenson never approached dangerously near 
the line crossed by so many of his literary com- 
patriots, from Carlyle and the Laird of Auch- 
inleck to Mr. Crockett and Mr. Barrie. He was 
not merely a Scotchman, but, as Henry James 
put it, a Scotchman of the world. But it re-

mains true that his personality was " a mar- 
ketable thing," to quote the phrase wrathfully 
uttered by W. E. Henley in his memorable out- 
burst of two years ago; and no publication 
which recognizes that aspect of the Stevenson 
of literature and life is wholly without excuse 
for existence. 

The literary and critical merit of the com- 
pilation is decidedly uneven. It could hardly 
be otherwise ; since, as we are informed, the 
editor searched for his material in the " for- 
gotten pages of English and American period- 
icals " (and newspapers, it should be added), 
as well as in " books by writers of eminence 
not entirely concerned with Stevenson." To 
the devout Mussulman, no scrap of paper that 
bears the sacred name of Allah is worthless. 
It was possibly a modified form of this rever- 
ential spirit which actuated Mr. Hamraerton in 
pursuing his researches ; for not a great part 
of the rescued " copy " which makes up the 
first seven or eight chapters of the book has 
any value as a contribution to our knowledge 
of Stevenson. A description, by Mr. Charles 
Warren Stoddard, of Stevenson as he appeared 
during his California days is worth quoting for 
the sake of comparison with a different esti- 
mate lately expressed. 

" A man of the frailest physique, though most unac- 
countably tenacious of life; a man whose pen was in- 
defatigable, whose brain was never at rest; who, as far 
as I am able to judge, looked upon everything from a 
supremely intellectual point of view. ... A man un- 
fleshly to the verge of emaciation, . . . whose sympa- 
thies were literary and artistic; whose intimacies were 
born and bred above the ears." 

In the recently published " Faith of Robert 
Louis Stevenson " we find Mr. John Kelraan 
emphasizing the close relation between the flesh 
and the spirit indicated in Stevenson's expres- 
sion of his personality. " At all times he is a 
spirit very deeply embodied in flesh," he says in 
a passage which " The Athenaeum," in review- 
ing the book, praised for its penetration. "In 
the flesh, as he depicts it, you constantly discern 
the spirit breaking through ; in the spirit, you 
seem still aware of the red tinge of flesh." Pro- 
fessor Stoddard knew Stevenson personally, 
Mr. Kelman knows him only through his 
works ; and we have again the old contrast 
between the " rosy-gilled athletico- aesthete " 
whom Mr. William Archer discovered in the 
Stevenson of the essays, and the " rickety and 
cloistered spectre, R. L. S." 

An interesting reminder of an amusingly 
incongruous episode in Stevenson's career is 
the article reprinted from the " Daily News " 



of London, and containing extracts from the 
testimonials given by Stevenson's friends in 
1881, at the time of his application for the 
Edinburgh chair of history. Sir Leslie Ste- 
phen wrote : " I know of no writer of Mr. 
Stevenson's standing of whose future career I 
entertain greater expectations "; John Ad- 
dington Symonds spoke of him as " having 
the temperament of an artist who cannot ac- 
quiesce in work that falls below his own stand- 
ard "; Mr. Andrew Lang described him as " the 
most ingenious and refined writer of his genera- 
tion." Mr. Robert Leighton's letter, quoted 
from "The Academy" of March 3, 1900, 
recalls the fact that for several years after this 
incident of his candidature, the recognizable 
earnings of the most ingenious and refined 
writer of his generation continued to be chiefly 
limited to praise. Thirty shillings per column 
of twelve hundred words was the "higher 
terms " demanded four years later by the author 
of " Treasure Island," when the serial publica- 
tion of " Kidnapped " was being arranged for. 
The El Dorado of the American magazine was 
as yet an undiscovered country, whose frontier 
had not been reached by the Amateur Emigrant. 

A paragraph in Mr. Harold Vallings's 
" Temple Bar " essay, describing Stevenson at 
Davos in 1881, shows him in a more familiar 
light than that of a candidate for professorial 
duties. 

" I have a most vivid recollection of a first view of 
him homeward bound from one of these before- breakfast 
[tobogganing] expeditions. He was dragging himself 
wearily along, towing a toboggan at his heals, his nar- 
row, hunched-up figure cut clear against the surpassing 
brilliance of the white Davosian world. With that 
pathetic half-broken figure making so dominant a note 
in one's recollections, one marvels indeed at the forti- 
tude that made possible his later achievements. Through 
the closing weeks of that winter season it was my hap, 
through sheer good luck, fostered in some measure by 
a nascent enthusiasm for Art, to foregather pretty fre- 
quently with the courageous invalid, and only once do 
I remember his uttering a despondent word. * I can't 
work,' he said to me one day. ' Yet now that I've 
fallen sick, I've lost all my capacity for idleness.' " 

Most can raise the flower love of idleness to- 
day, but twenty years ago the lament quoted 
above could have been uttered by no one but 
the author of the " Apology for Idlers." 

An Auckland, New Zealand, newspaper fur- 
nishes a report of an interview with Stevenson 
on the subject of the best course of study for 
young men with literary aspirations, in which 
he said : 

«' If a young man wishes to learn to write English, 
he should read everything. I qualify that by excluding 
the whole of the present century in a body. People

will read all that is worth reading out of that for their 
own fun. If they read the seventeenth century and the 
eighteenth century; if they read Shakespeare and Sir 
Thomas Browne, and Jeremy Taylor, and Dryden's 
prose, and Samuel Johnson, — and, I suppose, Addison, 
though I never read him myself, — and browse about 
in all the authors of those two centuries, they will get 
the finest course of literature there is. Those are the 
two extremes. What we have tried to do in this cen- 
tury is to find a middle-road between the two extremes, 
mostly and usually by being more slovenly. I have 
only one feather in my cap, and that is, I am not a 
sloven." 

Among contemporary writers, Stevenson 
found Sir Leslie Stephen and Mr. George 
Saintsbury best worth recommending to the 
colonial aspirants after a literary style. And 
the comment upon Scott is characteristic. 

" I would have your students read Scott, — but I 
wish you could put down my expression when I say 
this; it would save a good deal of explanation. He 
was undoubtedly slovenly. He makes me long to box 
his ears — God bless him I — but to a luminous and 
striking degree he was free from the faults that a great 
many of us possess." 

In the chapter headed "Miscellanea" are 
quoted the dedications to the set of his works 
presented by Stevenson in 1888 to his physi- 
cian in the Adirondacks, Dr. Trudeau. They 
will probably be new to most readers. " Kid- 
napped " bears the following inscription : 

" Here is the one sound page of all my writing. 
The one I 'm proud of, and that I delight in." 

" Prince Otto " has this verse : 

•* This is my only love-tale, this Prince Otto, 
Which some folks like to read, and others not to." 

" Familiar Studies of Men and Books" is thus 
prefaced : 

"My other works are of a slighter kind; 
Here is the party to improve your Mind! " 

Best of all is the amiably ironical comment 
upon his " Travels with a Donkey ": 
" It blew, it rained, it thawed, it snowed, it thundered, — 
Which was the Donkey? I have often wondered." 

An article in the same division, on the inter- 
esting Trevor-Haddon collection of " Letters 
to an Artist " contains an error which the 
editor was probably not in a position to detect. 
Instead of there being only five copies of the 
book in existence, as stated in the review 
quoted, several hundred copies were printed 
by the American publisher, and the regret that 
" only a favored few will ever have an oppor- 
tunity to read the letters in their entirety " is 
consequently unwarranted. 

More than a dozen poems to Stevenson are 
grouped in a separate chapter. Among the 
poets represented are Mr. William Watson, 
Mr. Hichard Le Gallienne, Miss Guiney, Mr. 



James Whitcomb Riley, Mr. Austin Dobson, 
and Mr. Bliss Carman, who has two poems, 
one the fine threnody "A Seamark." Mr. Ed- 
mund Gosse's beautiful dedication to his volume 
" In Russet and Silver," — " To Tusitala in 
Vailima," — which called forth the last and 
the saddest letter Stevenson ever wrote, is 
printed at the beginning of the chapter on 
" Island Days." It is a pity, unhappily familiar 
as we are with the reverse of the medal, that 
Henley's exquisite lyric " To R. L. S.," with 
the unforgettable closing lines — 

" And we lie in the peace of the Great Release, 
As once in the grsss together," 

should not have been included among the me- 
morial poems. 

The editor's labors in gathering his material 
for the chapters on " Stevenson the Man," 
" Stevenson the Artist," and " R. L. S. and 
His Contemporaries," were better rewarded 
than in the case of the biographical selections. 
Almost every contemporary writer of note, 
professional critic or not, is represented in the 
excerpts from critical articles. Mr. Henley's 
famous " Pall Mall Gazette " essay is quoted 
at great length. The unsigned article from 
"Blackwood's" (pp. 252-3), — from the pen 
of Professor Millar, if internal evidence based 
on resemblance to the Stevenson chapter in the 
" Literary History of Scotland " has any value, 
— is the only other example of criticism not 
entirely sympathetic. Even those writers who 
emphasize their recognition of Stevenson's 
limitations, as do Sir Leslie Stephen and Mr. 
David Christie Murray, do not maintain an 
unqualifiedly judicial attitude. And some of 
the novelist-critics, notably Mr. Quiller-Couch 
and Mr. Crockett - — to whom many literary 
sins should be forgiven for the sake of the 
phrase " His heart remembers how " in the 
dedication to the " Stickit Minister," — have 
touched their highest point of sincerity of ex- 
pression in the essays called forth by the death 
of the fellow- worker whom they loved. A 
comparatively unfamiliar piece of serious crit- 
icism, represented by several extracts, is Miss 
Alice Brown's fine though somewhat dithy- 
rambic " Study of Robert Louis Stevenson," 
which was printed, for private circulation, in 
1895. It concludes as follows : 

" That Stevenson could hold up his head and troll 
his careless ditties to the sun, after that Miserere of 
the soul, opens the mind like a flower to the possibilities 
of human regnancy. One man has looked hell in the 
face and stayed undaunted. One man has peered over 
the gulf where suns are swinging and unmade stars 
light up the dusk, and yet retained the happy sanity

of our common life. He returned from his Tartarean 
journey lifting to the unseen heaven the great, glad cry 
of ultimate obedience. Therefore will we not despair, 
nor wish one thorn the less had sprung before his feet. 
We are the stronger for his pain; his long conflict 
helps to make our calm. For very shame we dare not 
skulk nor loiter now; and whither Stevenson has gone, 
there do we, in our poor halting fashion, seek the way." 

Few readers, even though they be Steven- 
sonians, will close this book without realizing 
anew the truth of the old charge that Stevenson 
has been overpraised. Some of his critics have 
loved him so well that they have judged him ill. 
Yet it is not inevitable that the personal affec- 
tion which Stevenson alone of the writers of our 
day knew how to inspire should result in loss 
of critical balance. It is possible to feel all the 
charm of his marvellous style, so imitative and 
yet so unique, and still be incredulous when 
Dr.Watson says, " We judge that our master 
will go to the high table and sit down with 
Virgil and Shakespeare and Goethe and 
Scott." And in the picturesquely erratic wan-

thing less than a guide, and yet be blind to

Mr. Crawford's new novel, " The Heart of 
Rome," makes the usual presentation of those 
types of Roman society that have been so fre- 
quently limned by the author as to become very 
familiar to us. There is the wealthy Baron Vol- 
terra, banker and politician, whose past is too shady 
to bear investigation, and his wife, whose one desire 
is to obtain admission into the charmed circle of the 
aristocracy. Then there is the dowager Princess 
Conti, with all the faults and prejudices of the older 
generation, and her daughter Sabina, in whose 
sincerity and simple strength the younger genera- 
tion is most charmingly typified. This exquisite 
creature makes a highly engaging heroine for the

romance ; the hero is found in a man of resolution 
and intellectual power, by birth an aristocrat, but 
by choice a republican, an engineer, and an arcbse- 
ologist. So much for the personnel of the story. 
The substance is provided by the search for a treas- 
ure asserted by legend to be hidden beneath the 
foundations of the Palazzo Conti, and by the danger 
offered to such a search by the " lost water *' which 
flows beneath many Roman buildings, and for which 
arcbseologists have never been able satisfactorily to 
account. In the course of the story, the treasure 
is discovered, and turns out to consist of two ancient 
statues of priceless value. When the discoverer 
takes the heroine to see what he has unearthed, the 
" lost water " floods the passages through which 
they have entered, and threatens both with death 
from starvation. By working almost to the point 
of exhaustion, the hero breaks open a way of escape, 
and both lives are saved. This problem solved, the 
social problem must next be grappled with, for the 
situation has been a horribly compromising one in the 
eyes of the world, and the reputation of the heroine 
is sure to be lost if the fact ever becomes known. 
There are other complications which we have not 
space to consider, but will simply state that all 
difficulties are in the end cleared away. It is even 
more enjoined upon us to say that the story is sur- 
prisingly interesting — far more so than anything 
else that Mr. Crawford has done of late years, — 
and this for the very reason that he has in a meas- 
ure left bis well-beaten track, and centred his 
new novel about a situation which is both freshly- 
conceived and ingeniously contrived. 

"The New Arabian Nights" has evidently served 
as a model for "The Strange Adventures of Mr. 
Middleton," by Mr. Wardon Allan Curtis. Mr. 
Middleton is a young clerk in a lawyer's office who 
is found one rainy night on South Clark Street, 
Chicago, carrying back to the emporium of Mr. 
Marks Cohen the dress-suit which he has recently 
rented from that obliging Hebrew for the purpose 
of taking part in a certain social function. Taking 
refuge from the rain in a shop which he happens 
to be passing, he is invited within, and there makes 
the acquaintance of the hereditary emir of the tribe 
of Al-Yam. This engaging Oriental has come to

collect some new stories for the entertainment of 
his royal master, who had got tired of the old <' tales 
of genii and magicians, of enchantments and spells, 
devils, dragons, and rocs." He has learned many 
strange things during his "Western sojourn, and is 
confident that the Arabian potentate will be much 
impressed by their interest and novelty. But he 
thinks it wise to try them upon someone else as a 
preliminary, and invites his new acquaintance to 
play the part of sympathetic listener. This is the 
framework which serves to connect a most surprising 
series of adventures, recounted from night to night 
in the Clark Street shop. The stories show a fresh- 
ness of invention and a sense of humor much out of 
the common, and we could wish that there were 
many more of them. In the end, the emir becomes 
enamoured of an American maiden whom he has 
met at Green Lake, Wisconsin, and in consequence 
renounces his country, his religion, and his leanings 
toward polygamy, joins the Presbyterian Church, 
and becomes united to the object of his affections. 
Through his generosity, young Mr. Middleton is 
enabled to marry a young woman of Englewood 
upon whom his heart has long been set, and all ends 
happily, save for the Arabian potentate who thus 
loses his chance of being regaled with the choice in- 
ventions of our author. But this loss is our gain, and 
we cannot be expected to have more than a shadowy 
sort of sympathy for this modern Shahriyar. 

" When I Was Czar," by Mr. Arthur W. March- 
mont, is a story and nothing else. It is, moreover, 
a highly sensational story, made up of nihilist plots, 
and court intrigues, and ambushes, and murders. 
The hero is an American of magnificent " nerve," 
and the heroine is a wronged Russian princess whose 
champion and deliverer he becomes. Mr. March- 
mont has in this case indulged himself in a more 
extravagant invention than heretofore, and has cast 
aside all pretence of tolerable diction. The book is 
one that has no conceivable relations with literature, 
yet we must admit that as a story its interest is 
fairly absorbing. 

The history of "Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer " 
provides a stirring subject for the latest romance 
from the Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady's prolific pen. 
The story is concerned with the final phase of Mor- 
gan's life, when the death of Charles II. in 1685 
loses him his governorship of Jamaica, and he goes 
buccaneering again. The author has taken great 
liberties with history, which are perhaps justified by 
his romantic ends. He gives us, for once, a tale 
that has a Spanish gentleman for its hero, and the 
change from the long succession of Spanish villains 
is both welcome and historically just. In the char- 
acter of Morgan, we have a real pirate, a composite 
study from many documents, about whom there is 
no glamour save that of resourcefulness and reck- 
less daring. 

Mr. Garland's "Hesper" tells the story of a 
young woman, bred to the life of society in the 
narrow and ignoble sense, and profoundly dissatis- 
fied with it, yet seeing no way of escape from its 



deadening influences, until a happy chance sends 
her to the far West — to the mountains and the 
mining-camp. The needs of a young brother, in 
delicate health, bring about this change of scene, 
and then begins for her a process of regeneration 
which is destined eventually to vitalize her interests 
and strengthen her character. At first she revolts 
against the bitter necessity of contact with the rude 
manners of the frontier, and of association with 
people whose breezy energy and primitive good 
temper are not sufficient to atone to her for their 
lack of what she has hitherto called cultivation. 
Meanwhile, the sickly younger brother — a genuine 
and lovable boy, albeit more slangy than was really 
necessary to make him convincing — takes to the 
new life like a duck to water, and the sister finds it 
impossible either to leave him or to take him home 
with her. The hero is introduced at an early stage 
in the story, being presented as the foreman of a 
ranch to begin with, and afterwards as an adventurer 
in the uncertain game of mining. He has upon him 
the shadow of a mysterious past, and is equipped in 
the present with most engaging qualities of courage, 
resolution, and downright manliness. As the story 
nears its climax, it becomes the record of a strike 
in the mining-camps, and the author holds his scales 
with judicial balance, recognizing the rights and the 
wrongs of both parties to the conflict. He also suc- 
ceeds in making the narrative one of breathless ex- 
citement, without resorting to sensational devices. 
The romantic outcome is what the reader has a 
right to expect, and he closes the book with the sense 
of having assisted in a dramatic spectacle, and at 
the same time of having witnessed a consistent de- 
velopment of character in the case of the heroine, 
at least, if not in that of the hero. We do not hes- 
itate to say that " Hesper " represents the best work 
that Mr. Garland has done ; in it he has sloughed 
off most of his earlier defects of thought and expres- 
sion ; his asperities have become softened, and his 
rawness has undergone a transformation into some- 
thing very like urbanity. And all this evolution 
has been accomplished without any diminution of 
the earnestness and the energy which first directed 
attention to him as a writer. It is a far cry from 
" Main- Travelled Roads " to the present voliAne, it 
seems almost too far to be accounted for by a mere 
matter of fifteen years. 

" The Web," by Mr. Frederick Trevor Hill, is a 
novel which takes us into the thick of American 
business life, the region in which unscrupulous cor- 
porate interests, legal chicanery, and corrupt poli- 
tics are inextricably interwoven. Such is " the web" 
which we are called upon to disentangle. A divorce 
suit and a murder provide interests of a more pri- 
vate nature. All this material is skilfully combined 
into a story that moves logically from point to point, 
and is told most successfully from the constructive 
point of view. It is intensely real, if not exactly 
inspiring, and the types of character presented are 
faithful studies from the life. Such fiction as this 
is the inevitable product of such a civilization as

we now boast; it certainly fulfils the purpose of 
holding the mirror up to nature as it is here and now, 
and exhibiting the form and pressure of the time in 
which our lot is cast. 

In " The Beaten Path " by Mr. Richard Lawrence 
Makin, a new writer whose further acquaintance we 
shall hope to make, a path of invention is chosen 
which, if not already " beaten," is by way of becoming 
so. The story is of labor, capital, and politics, of 
fraudulent company promotion on the one hand, 
and of the rising tide of socialism on the other. Yet 
we fancy that the intention of the author in selecting 
bis title was rather to emphasize those private rela- 
tions between men and women which served fiction 
for a beaten path long before the political and social 
issues of the present day came into the foreground 
of our life. Be this as it may, Mr. Makin has given 
us a novel of unusual strength and interest, informed 
by high ideals of public and private morality, yet 
by no means taking the form of a sermon explicitly 
formulated. As a study of political corruption, the 
scene of the novel is very fittingly placed in what is 
probably the most corrupt of the American Com- 
monwealths. The Leverson Car Works, about which 
the story centres, are situated in one of the smaller 
cities of Pennsylvania, and the formation of the 
" trust " of which they are the basis affords a con- 
venient opportunity for illuminating the methods of 
modern finance and politics alike. All this serious 
matter is skilfully interwoven with a skein of com- 
plex personal interests that excite the sympathies to 
an unusual degree, and lead up to a climax which, if 
a trifle melodramatic, supplies the arch with a most 
effective keystone. There are half a dozen or more 
studies of character drawn with singular firmness 
of hand, and offering types of strongly contrasted 
interest. Altogether, the performance is an exceed- 
ingly creditable one, and we congratulate the author 
upon a highly successful first book. 

Another first book is "The Mills of Man," by 
Mr. Philip Payne, a brother of Mr. Will Payne, 
who already has several good books to his credit. 
This work, like the one just mentioned, is steeped 
in actuality, and presents a picture of present-day 
politics which is almost brutal in its realism. It 
■combines a political struggle for the reelection of a 
Republican Senator from Illinois, as well as for the 
Slate ticket, with a corrupt scheme for obtaining 
franchise control over the public utilities of Chicago. 
All the principal types of politician are represented, 
— the city boss, the free silver demagogue, the 
foxy old-timer, and the wealthy aspirant for public 
honors. The reformer also appears, but only in 
unworthy caricature, and the mention of his activ- 
ities always provokes a sneer and leaves a disa- 
greeable impression. Mr. Payne's political figures 
are not portraits of existing individuals, but com- 
posites in which we recognize now one, now another, 
of the men who have recently played conspicuous 
parts in the politics of Illinois and Chicago. A 
great deal of the book is jargon — it could not deal 
truthfully with its subject were it written in pol- 



ished English — but the author is capable at need 
of a dignified and impressive form of speech, as in 
the following passage, which illustrates the reflec- 
tions of a cultivated woman spectator upon a scene 
in the State Convention. The advocates of free 
silver have made a strong showing under the lead- 
ership of the Governor of Illinois, in whose figure 
one may easily recognize some, at least, of the char- 
acteristics of the late Mr. Altgeld. " Who were 
nobler, those men of riches in the cities, with their 
loose morals, their cynical contempts, their concep- 
tion of the world as an exchange to make profits in 
and as a mart to buy sensual luxuries in, or those 
country lawyers and unpolished yeomen, morally 
austere, who cherished in this corrupt day the eth- 
ical ideals of the high Anglo-Saxon race, and who 
were animated now by a vision of Justice enthroned 
and human brotherhood become an institution ? 
Mrs. Corlis poignantly suspected in her soul that 
the dream of these men might be the authentic 
modern vision of the weal of Saint Augustine's 
Civitas Dei, the City of God." A few such gleams 
of idealism light up the pages of Mr. Payne's book 
here and there, and give heart to the reader well- 
nigh disheartened by an exhibition of greedy and 
selfish motives that he must sadly recognize as only 
too truthful. 

Mr. Barr's " Over the Border " is a straight- 
forward historical romance of the Long Parliament 
and the Civil War. Strafford and Cromwell are the 
leading figures, as far as the history is concerned, 
and the romance is supplied by a daughter of the 
attainted Earl and a venturesome Scottish free 
lance. The intrigues of Charles with his Scottish 
allies are at the basis of the action, which relates 
mainly to a mission sent by the latter to the King 
at Oxford to obtain legal warrant for their partici- 
pation in his cause. Hero and heroine make the 
perilous journey in company, and the outcome is 
what the seasoned novel reader expects. Mr. Barr 
does not slobber over his work, as is the wont of 
many writers of this sort of fiction, but gives us a 
clean-cut and logically-developed narrative, which 
economically adjusts the means to the ends, and 
exhibits trained craftmanship at every point. 

Mr. Albert Lee, in writing "The Baronet in 
Corduroy," has deserted the romantic times of 
Spanish rule in the Netherlands for the compara- 
tively prosaic life of England at the close of the 
seventeenth century. The Stuart plot to invade 
England provides a certain element of romance to 
the narrative, which is otherwise concerned with the 
debtor's prison, the gossip of the coffee-houses, and 
the follies of fashionable society. The baronet in 
corduroy is a reckless and dissipated noble who 
wastes his substance in gambling and debauchery, 
yet contrives by superficial qualities of grace and 
heroism to win the love of a pure-souled country 
maiden, the heiress to a large fortune. The mar- 
riage, the miseries that follow, and the subsequent 
release of the heroine from an abhorred union make 
up the substance of the story, which is of only

average qaality, and in no way particularly note- 
worthy. 

A novel that verges close upon history is pro- 
vided by Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch in his " Hetty 
Wesley." The heroine is the wayward sister of 
John and Charles Wesley, and the story of her life, 
as told largely in the family letters, is profoundly 
moving. As the story progresses, we become in- 
timately acquainted, not only with the unfortunate 
Hetty, but also with all the other members of the 
remarkable household to which she belonged until 
driven forth for her sin by a stern parent. The 
author handles his theme with delicate sympathy, 
and is remarkably successful in imparting vitality 
to his scenes and characters. 

" Barbe of Grand Bayou," by Mr, John Oxenham, 
is a story of the Breton coast. A young woman 
and her morose father live together in a lighthouse. 
The girl has grown up with no other human com- 
panionship, and promptly falls in love with a youth 
whom one day she happens to rescue from the boil- 
ing waters. Presently a rival appears, who con- 
trives to put the favored lover out of the way by 
hurling him into a cavern. Incidentally, the rival 
falls in himself, breaks most of his bones, and dies 
a lingering death. His victim, on the other hand, 
survives, lives for some weeks among the stalactites, 
eats rock-doves and their eggs, has a desperate fight 
with a devilfish, and finally attracts the attention 
of his friends by contriving a sort of torch which 
he thrusts through a cleft in his prison-walls. No 
sooner is he rescued than he is charged with the 
murder of his rival, who, it will be remembered, 
had disappeared on the same day with his victim. 
When finally acquitted through evidence unearthed 
by his friends, and by the aid of a brilliant Parisian 
advocate, he marries the girl, and the story ends. 
It is a thrilling sort of tale, related with the author's 
keen sense of dramatic and picturesque effect, al- 
ready well-proved by his previous romances. The 
devil-fish episode is a little too obviously imitated 
from Hugo, but what is the poor novelist to do if 
all the good situations are debarred him by the fact 
of their having been used before? 

Mr. Rider Haggard has strayed far from the 
wonted paths of his invention in the composition of 
"Stella Fregelius." Here we have no fantastic rec- 
ord of adventures in strange lands, but a story of sim- 
ple English life, made romance by investment with 
an air of mysticism. The hero is a dreamer whose 
dreams receive practical embodiment in an invention 
called the aerophone, which is an application of 
Marconi telegraphy to the telephone. Circumstances 
of a very natural and material sort lead him to 
marry a practical, domestic, sweet-tempered English 
girl, a creature of flesh and blood as distinctly as he 
is a creature of the spirit. The heroine proper is a 
maiden of Norse ancestry whose life he rescues from 
shipwreck (in a literal sense). She is a somewhat 
uncanny person endowed with something in the 
nature of second sight. Becoming the real com- 
panion of his life (although in all purity), she is 



tragically taken from him. He broods over her 
death, and seeks by force of concentrated will to 
summon her spirit back into his existence. In other 
words, he deliberately cultivates a morbid tendency, 
and the hallucination for which he yearns is finally 
vouchsafed him. Ideally, this means the accom- 
plishment of bis desire ; practically, it means that 
he becomes insane, and dies of an overwrought 
condition of cerebral excitement. The story is 
developed with considerable skill, but Mr. Haggard 
does not know how to join his visions with his facts. 
Realism and Spiritualism stand side by side through- 
out the work but remain ever incongruous and dis- 
united. Perhaps we can best express our meaning 
in this criticism by saying that the author needs the 
peculiar power displayed by Bulwer in "Zmoni" 
and " A Strange Story," and unfortunately does 
not possess a whit thereof. He attempts what is to 
a writer of his temperament and matter-of-fact 
imagination the impossible, and thus fails to produce 
the desired effect. 

There is a strain of mysticism, mingled with much 
sensuous and dramatic material, in Mr. Max Pem- 
berton's " Doctor Xivier." In one aspect, the 
writer seems to have emulated so cheap a model as 
Mr. Boothby's Doctor Nikola; in another, the pro- 
totype of his fiction seems to have been the sort of 
romance which we view in " The Prisoner of Z-nda" 
and its numerous literary progeny. The malign 
purpose of Doctor Xavier is to gain control of a 
petty Spanish principality on the Pyrennean border; 
be seeks to accomplish this end through the medium 
of an innocent young woman upon whom he exerts 
a semi-hypnotic iiifluence, but who in the end escapes 
from his toils' and thwarts his villainy. The story 
cannot be taken seriously from any literary point 
of view. 

"The Masterfolk," by Mr. Haldane Mac Fall, is 
a depiction of Bohemian life in London and Paris 
which seems at the start to have the makings of a 
capital story. Until we get half-way into the book, 
or thereabouts, there is variety of incident and ac- 
tion, and the unfolding of a pietty plot. Then the 
author seems to lose his grip, the narrative becomes 
disjointed and chaotic, and we get callow philosophy 
in the place of dramatic vigor. Toward the end, we 
fairly lose our way in a moi ass of incoherent ravinjjs, 
and the story vanishes clean out of sight. Mr. 
MacFall should beware of fine writing ; he has in this 
instance suffered ignominious defeat for attempting 
it. He should aho cultivate compression, for he is 
garrulous beyond endurance. The title of the novel 
is a Nietzschian suggestion, we may add by way 
of explanation. 

We thought that Mr. Benson had lived down the 
memory of " Dodo." Certainly he has made a 
strenuous effort to do so, and he showed himself to 
be made of sterner stuff when he chose the war of 
Greek independence for the subject of two excep- 
tionally strong novels. But his latent novel, although 
far from being the mere froth of his first early 
indiscretion, shows him still beset by the temptation

to tarn oat sparkling epigrams, and to make the 
daily intercoarse of average mortals an exchange of 
labored repartee. It is called " The Relentless 
City," and the reason thereof is a mystery. A part 
of the story is placed in New York, and that metrop- 
olis is pictured as an insatiate monster which makes 
exhausting demands upon the vitality of its denizens. 
If this be the explanation, the title is badly forced, 
but we can suggest no other. Mr. Benson's mental 
attitude toward things American is curious. He 
seems to have spent a few weeks among us, and to 
have seen the sort of things that are usually seen by 
the properly accredited visiting Englishman. He 
writes of society ( in the vulgar sense) in New York 
and Newport, and depicts it as the pursuit of hollow 
joys by persons of unbounded wealth. Of American 
life, properly speaking, he seems to know absolutely 
nothing. But in dealing with the phases he has seen 
(or perhaps only imagined), he exhibits a singular 
striving to be sympathetic, if patronizing, and then 
undoes all his efforts by indulgence in a kind of 
caricature more grotesque than was ever imagined 
by Dickens. His English types bear, of course, some 
resemblance to life, although even that is marred 
by the sort of conventional literary glitter with which 
he feels bound to invest them. There is a good deal 
of writing in the book that is merely slovenly, and 
there is no constructive art worth speaking of. We 
cannot congratulate Mr. Benson upon his latest 
performance. William Morton Payne. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

" The Ambassadors " (Harper) is one of the longest, 
if not the very longest, novel Mr. Henry James has yet 
written. It is in something of his earlier manner, — 
his earlier manner, that is, with all the keenness of 
analysis his superior age and all the subtlety of treat- 
ment his advancing art make possible. His style is 
less involved here than in other comparatively recent 
writings of his, yet it is far too intricate to permit the 
conscientious reader any of the delights of skipping with 
the possibility of understanding all that happens after 
the break. The two most engaging characters in the 
book are those of an elderly man who regards himself 
as a failure because he is merely the editor of a very 
minor magazine published through the money of an 
elderly widow who is interested in him, and of a gentle- 
woman courier whom he meets in England while on his 
way to France to extricate the son of the widow from 
an entanglement with an altogether enchanting French- 
woman. It will be seen that in such an argument 
Mr. James has abundant room for the display of his 
finest qualities, and "The Ambassadors" will no doubt 
rank with bis more notable achievements. 

Once granting that no such character as Mr. Alfred 
Henry Lewis has drawn for the title role in " The Boss " 
(Barnes) could by any possibility talk or write in the 
language assigned him — a shrewd mixture of the Tudor 
translator and the western cowboy, — we must recog- 
nize in the story an interesting and accurate study of a 
modern human phenomenon, and one of the most artis- 



tically conceived and executed works of fiction among 
the number of similar books recently published. From 
a street boy the " Boss " becomes the arbiter of the 
destinies of the city of New York. Mr. Lewis points 
out, far too clearly to admit of misunderstanding, that 
it is only through intimate alliance with the so-called 
" best element " in the community that the boss is per- 
mitted to thrive as a licensed land-pirate. The moral 
element of the tale, above and beyond the sordidness of 
the chief character and his associates in crime against 
the body politic, is to be found in the retribution which 
follows him through life, inflicted in the bosom of his 
family as an indirect result of bis iniquity, though never 
consciously accepted by him as such. 

Another political boss — in Philadelphia this time — 
figures in " The Chasm " (Appleton), a book written 
by Messrs. Reginald Wright Kauffman and Edward 
Childs Carpenter. Here, again, one has to make allow- 
ances, for the authors assume that a shrewd Irishman 
is foolish enough to think that an education begun in 
private American schools and rounded out at Oxford 
and by continental travel will fit his only son to take up 
his political power and carry it from municipal bossism 
into international statesmanship. The failure of the 
experiment is as complete as it is inevitable; though 
this is the engineering feat by which the chasm between 
the Irish boss and an American girl of mature age and 
excellent position is finally bridged. There is much 
movement in the story. 

The passing of the Mississippi steamboat as the dic- 
tator of transportation, and the coming into power of 
the railway, form the theme of " Tennessee Todd " 
(Barnes), which Mr. G. W. Ogdeu rightly describes in 
his sub-title as " A Novel of the Great River." The 
potentate of the steamboat trade and the coming rail- 
way magnate are partners. Fair warning is given of 
the passing of the power of the river boat when the 
partnership is dissolved, but a losing fight is promptly 
begun and persisted in with all the eventual ferocity of 
a fixed idea. The son of the railway man and the 
daughter of the steamboat man fall in love; and the 
young, uncontrolled, but essentially womanly young 
person who gives title to the book adds her mite to the 
other asperities of the situation to keep its course from 
running smooth. Mr. Ogdeu records a chapter in na- 
tional development that is being rapidly forgotten, and 
does it acceptably and with forcefulness. 

While it is the catching of the masculine affections 
" on the rebound " that gives its name to Miss Mary 
Moss's "A Sequence in Hearts" (Lippincott), and the 
story is mainly interesting as a study of psychology in 
love among Philadelphians of the better class, there is 
a real comprehension of the problems presented by 
monopoly and labor that has more than ordinary perti- 
nence at this time, the scene of the conflicting interests 
being the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania. One of the 
characters in the book — and the most engaging of its 
masculine figures — is the owner of a mine, and he 
purposes settling his differences with his men without 
interference from his fellow-operators. The book can 
be read not only for the interest of its story, but also 
for the actual information it contains, evidently based 
as it is on first-hand knowledge. 

Four short stories make up Mrs. Mary Hallock 
Foote's volume entitled " A Touch of Sun, and Other 
Stories" (Houghton), and all are done with that exact 
touch and cleverness which have so long been accredited 
to this acceptable writer. They are tales of life on the

Pacific side of the Great Divide, and interpret the vari- 
ance in character which gives California and its people 
so mnch of individuality among the states of the Union. 
The first of them, the story that lends its name to the 
volume, is admirably made up of a semi-tropical back- 
ground before which, in a semi-tropical atmosphere, is 
enacted a tale of love, with the young man a fine pro- 
duct of all that is best in the ordered life of New En- 
gland and the young woman all that is different on the 
other edge of the continent. The second story, " Pil- 
grims to Mecca," presents a similar contrast between 
East and West; and the two others, while not variants 
on the same theme, are filled with keen knowledge and 
analysis of character. 

From such work as this to Miss Frances Parker's 
"Marjie of the Lower Ranch" (C. M. Clark Co.) 
implies the passing from polite and clever comedy to 
melodrama, pure and simple. Marjie is a nice young 
girl who is manifestly out of place on a western ranch 
among the mountains. Not far from her dwells an out- 
law, who is still guardian for the grown son of a friend 
who has gone to his reward. There are ensuing mys- 
teries, and the course of true love is sadly cluttered with 
many things. But it all comes right in the denouement. 
The book is interesting, though sensational. 

Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford's "That Betty" 
(Revell) is a pretty little story of a humbly circum- 
stanced New England girl, written with a more direct 
appeal to other young girls than to the general public. 
It has humor, pathos, self-sacrifice, and the eventual 
reward in its pages, and is genre work of the better 
sort, with a moral lesson not too obtrusively dragged 
into the main current of events. Such love as is shown 
here, like faith, will move mountains, and every diffi- 
culty of life, present, past, and to come, would disappear 
before it as the world's one alcahest. 

The ravings of insanity fill most of the pages of 
Mr. Horace Mann's «' The World-Destroyer " (Lucas- 
Lincoln Co.), its protagonist being a rich young man 
who has conceived himself to be the Emperor of the 
World. In the course of his more public demonstra- 
tion of his qualifications for the office he is confined in 
a mad-house, and there his book is supposed to be writ- 
ten. As the lucid intervals are in no way designated, 
it is impossible for the reader to separate fact from 
frenzy, and the book is none the less morbid because 
the young man is desperately in love. 

The charm of such a community (of course with due 
allowance for differences of time and country) as Gray 
depicted in his " Elegy " is in Mrs. .Margaret Deland's 
" Dr. Lavendar's People " (Harper), a book of char- 
acter sketches of real literary refinement. The kindly 
old clergyman, rector of the most human of parishes, 
acts as the deus ex machind for all the adversities which 
untoward circumstance and mortal frailty can inflict 
upon his parishioners, — boys and girls, men and women. 
This interposition of the wise and kindly old man en- 
ables Mrs. Deland to spiritualize every one of the six 
novelettes which make up the volume, and leaves it a 
book to be admired on every account. 

The old Indiana road that ended at Fort Dearborn 
gives title to "On the We-a Trail" (Macmillan), in 
which Mrs. Caroline Atwater Brown tells the tale of 
whites and Indians during the second war of indepen- 
dence, and tells it with a knowledge of and sympathy 
for the aborigines which gives it a place by itself. Their 
actual savagery is never minified ; but its causes, so often 
springing from rivalries among European nations and 



white Americans, are also detailed, and one is permitted 
to see that they are quite as human as their lighter 
skinned brethren. Especially well-drawn is the char- 
acter of the old French priest, while an Indian maiden 
preserves something of the Pocahontas tradition. The 
romantic atmosphere of the narrative is finely rendered, 
and the book one of sustained strength. 

Coming down a long generation to a scene geograph- 
ically proximate, Mr. Charles Major has written " A 
Forest Hearth" (Macmillan) in the somewhat saccha- 
rine manner he has done so much to make his own. 
His people live in Indiana in the third or fourth decade 
of the last century, the real hero of the narrative being 
an excellent English gentleman, exiled by an unhappy 
love, who is the keeper of the general store in the little 
settlement. The pretty young girl who grows up under 
his fostering protection, which shields her against a 
mother with a hypertrophied sense of justice, is far 
more sensible than her youthful lover, who allows him- 
self to be shot at twice from behind by his deadly rival 
and mortal enemy. It is a book which will be read 
for its profusion of sentiment, and admired by the 
judicious for its almost forgotten background of semi- 
rustic life long ago. 

The curious reversal of process which turns a dra- 
matic work into a romance or a romantic history, the 
annals of literature pointing all in the other direction, 
is responsible for Mr. Justin Huntly McCarthy's " The 
Proud Prince " (Russell), a novel based on the play 
lately written for Mr. E. H. Sothern. The practice of 
this phase of fictional art seems too slight to permit of 
results truly literary, and the story remains essentially 
dramatic. This latter effect is heightened by the use of 
reproduced photographs of the characters in the drama 
as illustrations for the book, thus emphasizing the dif- 
ferences between stage conventions and the art of the 
illustrator, just as the text serves to show the differ- 
ences between the convention of the play and of the 
romance. The product seems illegitimate in a real 
sense, much as if sculpture and painting had been com- 
bined in a single work to produce a given effect, one 
deriving directly from the other. The play was inter- 
esting, the book is readable yet not artistic. 

The Rev. Joseph Hocking, like his brother the Rev. 
Silas K. Hocking, has a mighty following in Great 
Britain as a writer of pious romance. His newest 
book, "A Flame of Fire" (Revell), is a story simple 
enough in both conception and execution. Its action 
takes place in the spacious times of Queen Elizabeth, 
just previous to the sailing of the Great Armada. 
Three men set out from England to rescue from Span- 
ish hands the kinswoman of one and the former love of 
another of the trio. These doughty heretics defy and 
put to scorn not only the dreaded Inquisition, — con- 
ducted on this occasion by the Jesuits, — but Philip 
himself. The corpus upon a wonder-working crucifix 
performs a miracle to save the English party, and, of 
course, it all comes right in the end. 

The short stories that make up the contents of Mr. 
W. W. Jacobs's " Odd Craft " (Scribner) are in some- 
thing of the author's best manner, though less related 
to the sea and those who go down into it in ships than 
any of his former writings. He deals with the lower 
classes with the same inimitable humor that has char- 
acterized all of his work, his turn of thought and play 
of light fancy bringing a chuckle with almost every 
paragraph. Mr. Jacobs delights in situations almost 
picaresque, and the ne'er-do-well with a genius for

roguery plays no small part in the fourteen tales that 
conapose the present volume. The admirable illustra- 
tions of Mr. Will Owen are almost as mirth-provoking 
as the text. 

Miss Una L. Silberrad has a touch in fiction per- 
fectly secure, and her new and strangely-named novel, 
»« Petronilla Herroven " (Doubleday, Page & Co.), is 
additional proof of the fact. Her present theme, as in 
previous books, is unusual, and her characters original. 
A young girl of uncertain parentage and humble cir- 
cumstances is insulted by a wealthy and influential man 
who later procures her dismissal by her putative father's 
mother. Self-contained from childhood, Petronilla goes 
slowly on to her revenge until her utterly unscrupulous 
enemy decides upon her murder. Here a higher fate 
interposes, and with security comes love and abundant 
compensations for earlier unhappiness. The book is 
vividly written, yet with restraint, and is fairly fasci- 
nating in its developments. It leaves, moreover, a faith- 
ful impression of English village life, touching with 
fidelity upon several social grades in humbler life. 

" Wanted — A W^ife, By A. Bachelor" (D. V. Wien 
& Co.) is not exactly fiction, though the teller of the 
story is something of a hero. His desire is for a life- 
partner who shall be above everything else womanly. 
In nominating his ideal he tramples on the toes of most 
of the modern prejudices in favor of sexual equality, 
and contrives to hit at both mankind and womankind, 
as they flourish to-day, with fine impartiality. " Men 
who are considered intelligent have not a single original 
thought," he remarks; "their conversation reproduces 
with more or less exactness the contents of their news- 
papers, and one is startled to see how many people who 
should know how to think for themselves have lost all 
initiative in the working of their mental apparatus." 
There are pages of this sort of thing; but the book is 
dull, and it will be finished with the conclusion that, 
after all, "A. Bachelor" deserves as his reward that 
English ideal: a stupid wife. 

A cruise in the Caribbean Sea is the motive of 
Mr. F. Frankfort Moore's " Shipmates in Sunshine " 
(Appleton), which may be described as a book of 
travel fictionized by the introduction of four or five 
little romances among the writer's fellow-passengers. 
There is thus an opportunity to describe the various 
islands of the West Indies where landings were made, 
with their people and habits and manners as seen in 
this casual way. The book must have been a pleasant 
one to write, and its equable tale of sunny days and 
balmy climes is certainly pleasant to read. 

In "The Strife of the Sea" (Baker & Taylor Co.) 
Mr. T. Jenkins Hains undertakes to do for the denizens 
of the sea and its shores what Mr. Ernest Thompson 
Seton has done for land animals and their human 
hunters and companions. He does it in practically the 
same manner, also, and seems to find it easy to assign 
a fairly human psychology to pelicans, penguins, and 
albatrosses on one side, and to rorquals, loggerhead 
turtles, sharks, albicore, and the giant rays or devil- 
fish on the other. Most of the stories deal with man- 
kind as well, but the essential thing is the sea bird, 
cetacean, or huge fish which he has described. As the 
inhabitants of the waters and their shores are predatory 
in the extreme, there is slaughter and to spare through- 
out the book, though lives are saved almost as often 
as they are lost. The book is striking, and in subject 
matter — though not in treatment — is sufficiently orig- 
inal. 



Bkiefs on New Books. 



In his recent Huxley Memorial Lee- 
S7C&. t"'^^' Professor Karl Pearson lays 

each stress on the importance of 
heredity as to discourage belief in the influence of 
environment and in the efficacy of individual exer- 
tion toward self-improvement. Bishop Spalding, 
in his "Glimpses of Truth" (McCiurg), preaches 
the contrary doctrine, holding that what man " has 
produced within himself transcends, directs, and con- 
trols that which is born in him "; and consequently 
that " in law, in medicine, and in the ministry, the 
greatest students, not the greatest talents, reach the 
summit." In literature, he adds, education and 
endless pains take the precedence of rude genius. 
This hopeful view, not only of the certainty of free- 
will, but of its infinite power of accomplishment, 
gives its helpful and inspiring character to the 
whole book. Yet the author seems to contradict 
himself when, emphasizing the vanity of things 
earthly, he says, *' Mankind would be much what 
they are had their heroes never lived." Surely, he 
cannot mean that the real heroes of progress and 
reform have left no mark on the race. Although 
he returns again and again to the all-importance of 
the inner life, of study and meditation, he counsels 
us to refrain from analyzing our knowledge and 
our faith. But he must admit that to a thoughtful 
man that is not knowledge which cannot stand the 
test of analysis, and none but a reasoned faith can 
gain his acceptance. Indeed, only seven pages fur- 
ther on he writes : " They who think are the only 
noblemen. They are the masters of all they know, 
have overcome what they understand." This little 
book, of about the size of the " Imitatio Christi," 
contains frequent reminders of Thomas k Kempis, 
who might well have written such a sentence as 
this : " If thou art censured, examine thy conscience ; 
if praised, believe it flattery"; or this: "Thy vir- 
tues are all the more real the less thou thinkest of 
them ; but thy vices thou canst not study too assidu- 
ously." Now and then occurs an aphorism sug- 
gestive of Emerson. " Consistency is a virtue of 
the unprogressive," recalls the " hobgoblin of little 
minds." That our philosopher is no mere dreamer 
is proved by his daily life, as well as by his valued 
service on the late Anthracite Strike Commission; 
and his book is all the better for this.

the war. But one biography of Morris has been 
previously written, the small volume by Professor 
Sumner, who could not obtain the privilege of using 
Morris's papers in the preparation of his book. 
These papers have now been purchased by the 
government, and Mr. Oberholtzer's book has been 
written mainly from these and from other materials 
found in Philadelphia. It is a thorough piece of 
work, and the story of Morrid's life is told in an 
interesting way, though it is so full of dramatic 
contrast as well as of historical value that it could 
not be uninteresting in any hands. The publishers 
have given the work a most appropriate and taste- 
ful dress; in paper, binding, illustrations, and index, 
it is thoroughly satisfactory. The life of Robert 
Morris is typically American. A poor boy of ob- 
scure parentage, he showed himself apt in business, 
and became a merchant prince ; called to public 
life he was ready to accept the greatest responsi- 
bilities ; he was magnanimous and patriotic, giving 
himself and his wealth without stint to meet the 
necessities of the government ; the intimate friend 
of Washington, and entertaining with lavish hospi- 
tality all the distinguished people of the day, he 
finally lost all that he had through over-sanguine 
speculation and the booming of land companies, and 
spent more than three years in a debtor's prison, 
from which he emerged a broken man of sixty-eight, 
dependent on his family and friends. The rare 
ability and complete devotion that he gave to the 
financial needs of his country in her darkest days, 
and his buoyant faith in her glorious future, entitle 
him to a place among great Americans. 

In an article in these columns, about 
bX^oman'"^' ^^^ J^^rs ago, the question of "Wo- 
man and the Essay" was discussed, — 
with the practical conclusion that we have no women 
essayists. Some of the arguments then used were 
that the essays of women, while often clever, are 
too frequently overweighted by voluminous read- 
ing ; that they are too labored and profound, or too 
flippant and diffuse ; that they lack personality and 
distinction of style, and are also lacking in humor 
and impartiality — for women are apt to be self- 
conscious, and are by nature partisan. It is pleasant 
to find an absence of many of the above-mentioned 
faults, and the presence of qualities most to be 
desired in the light essay, in Mrs. Isa Carrington 
Cabell's volume entitled "The Thoughtless Thoughts 
of Carisabel" (Holt). Over a range of subjects as 
wide as from "The New Man" to " How Belinda 
Had the Grippe," this woman essayist is always 
good-natured and always herself. There is no un- 
due self-consciousness or weak sentimentality even 
when she writes of such subjects as love and mar- 
riage ; and there is considerable humor and in- 
sight into human character when the subjects are 
" Servants," " Dinner Parties," and " Conversa- 
tion." In short, it is the sort of book which on its 
arrival in the house finds its fresh-cut leaves turned 
by each member of the household. A second or 



more critical reading often reveals defects in style 
and a lack of finish, but there is not a chapter in 
the collection which does not afford amusement and 
pay for the reading. The point of view — "the 
unfashionable and passS opmion of a survivor of 
a past age," — applied to most of the modern sub- 
jects of the day, both fads and fancies, is a charm- 
ing combination consistently carried out. 

It is refreshing among the multitude 
thiZ^s!" of books devoted to Japan, to open 

one that has some sense of perspect- 
ive. In most of them the geisha is apt to occupy a 
place out of all proportions to the body social or 
politic. The author of " A Handbook of Modern 
Japan" (McClurg), Mr. Ernest W. Clement, is by 
no means a novice, either in his knowledge of Japan 
or in the making of literature. At Mito in the island 
empire, one of the old seats of feudal glory, knightly 
culture, and native learning, a decade and a half 
ago he spent several years not only as American 
teacher, but as an eager and patient investigator of 
Japanese history. He who knows well the transac- 
tions of the Asiatic Society of Japan (out of which 
so many books on " the sunny isles " are made in 
New York and London) knows also Mr. Clement's 
scholarship and literary industry. This handbook 
is a thesaurus of information concerning modem 
Japan. Fifty years ago, such enterprise would have 
cost Mr. Clement imprisonment. Now, however, 
the Japanese government vies with the foreigner in 
making public all things — except unbaked delica- 
cies of diplomacy and contemporaneous military 
information. So, out of his own treasures and the 
superb annual RSsumi Statistique of the Imperial 
Cabinet in Tokio, Mr. Clement has given us a double 
portion. We have here a feast served by a chef of 
long experience; everything has been proved by 
tasting, and all the ingredients and flavors known 
before being spread on the banquet table. The gen- 
eral excellence of the book extends to the proof- 
reading, and to the index also. Clear and abundant 
illustrations reinforce the text, and the bibliogra- 
phies at the end of the various chapters are the 
selection of a scholar at home among the very mixed 
crowd of books that represent and, for the most part, 
misrepresent Japan. In Mr. Clement's bibliogra- 
phies, books of this latter class are conspicuous by 
their absence. It would be difficult to name an 
important theme left unnoticed in this handy volume. 
History, industry, modern politics, manners and 
customs, the new woman, literature, language, 
sesthetics, religions, Christian missions, — all are 
discussed in a most pleasant and readable manner. 
The appendix is full of interesting items, — as for 
instance, we are told that in the Peking campaign, 
the Japanese, as compared with French, German, 
Russian, and American soldiers, had the fewest sick 
and disabled by disease. This is the book for the 
hour when Russia looms and Korea shrivels, or for 
the year and decade when — the map of Eastern 
Asia may be arranged.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



More of the ^^ *^® third volume of his " History 

■German struggle of the German Struggle for Liberty " 
/or liberty. (Harper), Mr. Poultney Bigelow con- 

tinues his story from 1815 to 1848. As in the 
preceding volumes, the method is biographical, and 
the author's journalistic training enables him to 
present, in his separate chapters, vivid pictures of 
individual characters or of single incidents. But 
the absence of any series of striking events, such as 
marked the Napoleonic wars, deprives the work of 
that chronological sequence that is essential in 
historical narrative. Mr. Bigelow recognizes this 
defect in his work, but urges, in his preface, that 
any other method would have been " dull beyond 
comparison." This statement is at least debat- 
able; aTid certainly the selection of characters and 
grouping of events might have been such that the 
whole would not have made the impression of a 
hopeless jumble. As it is, the reader requires a 
clear outline of the salient facts in German history 
in order to understand, in many cases, what the 
author is driving at. A more objective treatment 
would also have been an improvement. We have, 
for example, a series of chapters on Jahn. A 
single one might have told better every fact given, 
and have shown better the influence of the patriot's 
life, had the atmosphere of personal impression not 
been attempted. Carlyle could flash the person- 
ality of Frederick the Great upon us in a series of 
vivid sketches, or Freytag could group the history 
of a period about a single figure. Mr. Bigelow 
lacks the genius of the former and the systematic 
method of the latter. Entertaining and pleasant 
his book doubtless is, but it neither adds to our 
available knowledge of the subject nor is a work 
that can, without reservation, be recommended to 
the general reader. 

EngiUh society ^r. Fitzgerald Molloy's latest work, 
and politics in " The Sailor King, William IV., his 
the thirties. Q^urt and his Subjects" (Dodd), 

contains comparatively little about William himself, 
and still less about his nautical proclivities. But 
this is well; for who could endure the infliction of 
two octavo volumes on the sayings and doings of 
"Silly Billy"? We have, instead, an abundant 
flow of entertaining but not always edifying chron- 
icle and gossip concerning the noted people of the 
time. That Charles Greville's Journal is one of 
the author's chief sources of information, will suffi- 
ciently indicate the character of the narrative. 
Byron's and Shelley's and the Honorable Mrs. 
Norton's domestic tragedies are again rehearsed 
at length ; Disraeli's early eccentricities and un- 
blushing audacities add something of piquancy to 
a twice-told tale; and the whole is generously em- 
bellished with portraits and dignified with wide 
margins and clear type. The author's way of ex- 
pressing himself sometimes provokes a smile. The 
ages of his characters are reckoned bv summers. 
Browning is spoken of as being in 1836 a " youth 
■of barely twenty summers," which leaves four sum- 



mers of his life unaccounted for. A fire, even the 
burning of old letters, is a " holocaust." A false 
assertion of Byron's is stigmatized as "mendacious 
untruthfulness." No example of veracious untruth- 
fulness is given. Disraeli is " a mighty important 
personage." We are told that Mary Shelley gave 
birth to " a delicate girl baby who survived about 
ten days, much to its parents' grief." More regard 
for the little points of accuracy and the careful 
choice of words, even at the cost of a diminished 
output of his attractive volumes, is respectfully 
urged upon this popular writer. 



The second volume of " Appletons' 
c/nTrS:" World Series" maintains the prom- 

ise made in the volume on " Britain 
and the British Seas " some months ago. To Dr. 
Joseph Partsch, Professor of Geography in the 
University of Breslau, was assigned the labor of 
treating Central Europe. He prepared his work 
in German, in which language it is yet to appear in 
his native country. To adapt it to the needs of the 
series of essays descriptive of the great natural 
regions of the world, appearing under the editor- 
ship of Mr. H. J. Mackinder, M.A., the Oxford 
Geographer, it required not only translation for the 
benefit of English-speaking readers, but some cur- 
tailment as well. The work of author, translators, 
editor, and cartographers has been so admirably 
done that we have a volume replete with informa- 
tion, not only geographical, but ethnographical, 
historical, political, and economic, regarding the 
most important and one of the most populous re- 
gions in the world, including Germany, Austria- 
Hungary, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and 
the Balkan-Danubian states. This region is of 
perennial interest because of its position and world-' 
relation, and has been the scene of events unparal- 
leled in importance in the world's history. The 
appearance of the present work is especially timely 
because of the ethnic conditions which are an im- 
portant element in the ever-recurring " Eastern 
question." 

Dr. van Dyke's There are few persons to whom we 
selections from should be willing to entrust the edit- 
Tennyson-'s poems, j^g ^f Xennyson's poems, but Dr. 
Henry van Dyke may surely be reckoned among 
the competent few. His choice from " The Poems 
of Tennyson," comprised in a neatly-bound volume 
of moderate size (Ginn), is the first representative 
selection ever published, all previous abridgements 
having been confined to some special form of verse. 
The poems are arranged and classified so as to show 
the growth of the poet's art from simple melody to 
the higher forms of poetical expression. The one 
hundred and thirty-six selections are chosen from all 
the fields of Tennyson's poetry except the dramas, 
which for obvious reasons could not well be repre- 
sented. The shorter pieces are given in their en- 
tirety, and the text is that of Tennyson's latest 
revision. The introduction furnishes a scholarly

guide to the perusal of the poems. It outlines 
Tennyson's life, discusses his place in the literature 
of the nineteenth century, his use of the sources 
from which he drew his material, his revision of his 
work, and the qualities of his poetry ; besides fully 
explaining Dr. van Dyke's system of classification 
as followed in this volume. The illustrations include 
two portraits of Tennyson and two views of his 
homes. The frontispiece is from Partridge's head 
of the poet in marble, which is owned by Dr. van 
Dyke. Paper and print are of excellent quality, and 
the binding is simple and dignified. The volume 
will be a good one for introductory study or for 
familiar reading of Tennyson. 

A fresh reading of the essays of the 
^*ay*6y jat-g Frank Norris, collected under 

Frank Noms, ,. mi -ri m m- • .• 

the title of '' IheKesponsibihties of 
the Novelist, and Other Literary Essays " (Double- 
day, Page & Co.), leaves one with a sense of their 
virility and sincerity, combined with a certain rough- 
ness and crudeness characteristic of them through- 
out. Such expressions as the " razor contingent," 
for men, and the " G. A. N." for the " Great Amer- 
ican Novelist," with a frequent use of trite slang 
phrases, ofPend the taste in a serious discussion of 
literary subjects. It is reasonable and fair, how- 
ever, to presume that had Mr. Norris lived to revise 
these writings he might have given them the polish 
which they lack in their present form. They are 
full of wholesome truths and ideals for the young 
aspirant in literature, and their appeal for something 
more racial and more vigorous than has yet been 
produced in American literature is sounded with 
Mr. Norris's usual courage and hopefulness. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The Unit Books" of Mr. Howard Wilford Bell, 
which we mentioned a year or more ago in connection 
with the English inception of the enterprise, have now 
been transplanted to American soil, and the first issues of 
the series are at band. These books give us carefully- 
edited reprints, with notes, of books that are both 
famous and interesting, published with the authority 
of the owners (if there are any), and sold at the low rate 
of one cent for twenty-five pages. The two volumes 
now before us are Hawthorne's " The Marble Faun," 
at twenty-one cents, and a volume of Lincoln's letters 
and addresses. For thirty or fifty cents additional, the 
books may be had in cloth or leather covers. This 
seems to us a very commendable undertaking, and 
we wish it success. One hundred titles are already 
announced, and suggestions for additional volumes are 
invited. 

Canon Ainger's volume on Crabbe, in the series of 
" English Men of Letters " (Macmillan) is a piece of 
graceful and accomplished literary biography, dealing 
with its subject in a spirit of full sympathy, yet 
making no extravagant claims. Crabbe's memoir by 
his son, some notes by FitzGerald, a few letters, and 
the poet's own manuscript sermons and commonplace 



books, constitute the material with which Mr. Ainger 
has worked. Good taste and scholarship characterize 
the work throughout. The right of Crabbe to a place 
in this series was hardly to be disputed, and, so much 
being allowed, he could not have hoped for a more 
judicious biographer. 

" Gemme della Letteratura Italiana " is a handsome 
thousand-page volume published by Mr, Henry Frowde 
in connection with Signor Barbara of Florence. The work 
is edited by Professor Joel Foote Bingham, whose por- 
trait appears as a frontispiece. This extensive anthol- 
ogy is provided with biographies, critical notes, and 
other apparatus, including a series of appendices, deal- 
ing with the Italian Academies, and giving synopses of 
the most important works in Italian literature. The work 
covers the entire period of Italian literary history, from 
the origins down to the writers of the present day, and 
constitutes a small library in itself. There is not an 
English word in the volume from the first page to the 
last. 

In this age of reprints, Charles Lamb has not had his 
due share of attention until recently. The neglect m 
now more than atoned for by the nearly simultaneous 
appearance of three editions of his works. The first of 
these editions, of which four stout volumes are at band,^ 
has been prepared under the supervision of Mr. E. V. 
Lucas, and gives us " The Works of Charles and Mary 
Lamb." The American publishers are the " Messrs. 
Putnam. The apparatus of notes is very extensive. 
There are to be seven volumes of the works, beside* 
two of biography. The edition published by Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co., in connection with Messrs. Dent 
of London, extends to twelve volumes, and is edited 
by Mr. William Macdonald. The pictorial feature of 
this edition is one of its most marked characteristics. 
There are also abundant notes. These two editions 
may be regarded in a sense as rivals; the third one be- 
fore us, published by the Messrs. Scribner, is a mere 
reprint in a single volume, which is of pocket size,^ 
although the use of thin paper extends its dimension* 
to over eight hundred pages. 

It would be difficult to praise too highly the work 
done by Misses Charlotte Porter and Helen A, Clarke 
in their new editions of Shakespeare, published by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co, The "Camberw«U" 
Browning of these industrious literary workers has 
already left us deeply in their debt, and the obligation 
is more than doubled by the work of Shakespearian 
editing upon which they are now engaged. There are 
two editions, the " First Folio " and the " Pembroke," 
The former we have mentioned on a previous occasion,, 
and need at present do no more than repeat the state- 
ment that it gives us a play to a volume, and supplies 
with each play an amount of critical and " variorum '^ 
material which is ample for all the ordinary needs of 
the student. The text is absolutely that of 1623 in 
every respect. This edition is coming out slowly, and 
"The Comedie of Errors," just issued, is the third vol- 
ume thus far published. Meanwhile, the " Pembroke "^ 
edition comes to us complete in twelve volumes. Here 
also we have the text of 1623, together with a simplified 
critical apparatus which will quite satisfy the general 
reader. Each play has an introduction and a running 
glossary, and each volume has a portrait in photogra- 
vure, " Pericles," of course, is reprinted from the first 
quarto of 1609. The twelfth volume of the set con- 
tains the poems and sonnets, together with a brief 
biography of the poet.

Notes. 



Early in the present year Messrs. Frederick Warne 
& Co. of New York will publish " Frona Paris to New 
York by Land," written by Mr. Harry De Windt, 
F.R.G.S., author of "The New Siberia," etc., and who 
is now lecturing in this country. 

" The Omar Calendar " for 1904 is an attractive pro- 
duction issued by Messrs. Fox, Duffield & Co. It is 
printed on uncalendared Japan paper, and each of its 
twelve sheets bears one of the Rubaiyat, set in a deco- 
rative border designed by Mr. Austin Smith. 

The year-book for 1902-3 of the Bibliographical 
Society of Chicago has just appeared, and contains 
several interesting studies, the most important of which 
is " Some Bibliographical Notes on Italian Communal 
History," contributed by Mr. A. M. Wolfson. 

A " Text-Book Bulletin for Schools and Colleges " 
just issued by Messrs. Ginn & Co., has an unusual fea- 
ture in the shape of a very interesting leading article on 
" Some Landmarks in the History of Latin Grammar," 
illustrated with many facsimiles, contributed by Pro- 
fessor George Lyman Kittredge. 

« The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes " and <« The 
Refugees" have just been added to the new library 
edition of Sir Arthur Couan Doyle's novels, published 
by the Messrs. Appleton. To the similar series of the 
writings of '« Anthony Hope " two volumes have also 
been added, one containing " Rupert of Hentzau," 
the other containing "The Dolly Dialogues" and 
" Comedies of Courtship." Both these editions are 
sold in sets, by subscription. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. announce that they 
have just completed arrangements for the publication 
in England of Miss Liljencrantz's popular romances 
" The Thrall of Leif the Lucky " and " The Ward of 
King Canute." The English editions are to contain 
the color pictures which have proved so strong a factor 
in the success of the books. It may be noted in this 
connection that the Kinneys, whose pictures for these 
stories first attracted public attention to their capabili- 
ties as book illustrators, have just closed a contract for 
a series of paintings to be used in a story which Messrs. 
McClurg will issue in the Spring. 

A volume interesting to the bibliophile on several 
accounts is " The History of Oliver and Arthur," lately 
added to the Riverside Press special editions by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The work was originally 
written in French in 1511, and was translated into Ger- 
man in 1521. It is from the German edition that the 
present English version, by Mr. William Leighton and 
Miss Eliza Barrett, has been made. In printing the 
volume the publishers have endeavored to preserve 
something of the mediaeval flavor of the work. It is 
printed on hand-made paper, in " black letter " type 
with rubricated initials, and set in a double-columned 
page. Some forty engravings, redrawn from the old 
wood cuts which appeared in the original, serve as 
illustrations. 

The Massachusetts Civil Service Reform Auxiliary 
offers, free of all expense, pamphlets on civil service re- 
form to all high schools, normal schools, and colleges 
willing to make these pamphlets the subject of a lesson 
in their civics course. The titles of the pamphlets 
are " The Merit System — The Spoils System," by Mr. 
Edward Cary, and "The Merit System of Municipali- 
ties," by Mr. Clinton Rogers Woodruff. As the circu- 



lation of this offer directly to the heads of colleges and 
schools must of necessity be gradual, the Massachusetts 
auxiliary takes pleasure in announcing to teachers and 
others interested in the subject that copies of the above 
pamphlets together with other of its publications may be 
obtained free on application to the Assistant Secretary, 
Miss Marian C. Nichols, 55 Mount Vernon Street, 
Boston, Mass.

TO LOVE WHAT IS TRUE ; TO HATE SHAMS ; TO FEAR NOTHING WITHOUT ; 
AND TO THINK A LITTLE. —"Out West's" Editoktal Standard. 



C\\ ITT WP^T* edited by Chas. P. Lummis, is beyond question or comparison the foremost magazine in the greater half of the 
^^ ' l-wv? I f United States. From its foundation nearly ten yeirs ago, its purpose has been something more than to tell in 

text and picture about the Paniflc West, —its history, legend, romance, the beauty and grandeur of its scenery, its material, intellectual, 
and spiritual growth, — though it has done this with truth and care. Nor has it even been satisfied to interpret the Vital Spirit of the West — to 
set forth its significance for this generation and for those to come — though this too it has done so far as was possible. It has undertaken, be- 
sides, to lead in action, along some lines of much importance to the W^^stand to the Nation — to point out the way, and then go first along it. 

Of these movements, organized, led, and spoken for bv OU P WEST, we m^y name The Landmarks Club, which has done more 
than all other agencies combined to preserve the wonderful Old Missions ; The Siquoya League, which has already accomplished much 
in the direction of its declared purpose, " To Mak' Better Ind-aif — and RKit'r-Trmled Ones"; and The Constructive Leas:ue, organized 
to help solve the mighty economic problems of Irrigation, Cooperation, and the like. 

Do not think this has male OUT WEST a " heavy" magazine, or dull reading. Tothecontrary, it is peculiarly tonic and stimulating ; 
and lovers of good short stories find several of the best in each number. 

Naturally, we think OUT WEST alone is full value, and to spare, for its subscription price —$2.00 a year. But we propose to double, 
at least, our subscription list durmg the present season Therefore we have arrang-id a notable premium offer to attract new subscribers. 
If we cannot keep them, once we are acquainted, they are not our kind of subscribers. 

We have made lithotone engravings from hitherto unpublished portraits of sixteen of those living authors whose work counts for the 
most in Western literature. (The list is given below.) An artist's proof-sheet from each of these, with autograph signature in fac-simile, 
will be sent, loose for framing, in a beautiful portfolio, to each new subscriber entered before February 15, 190-1. i?he edition will be limited 
as nearly as possible to cover only this list of new subscribers, to whom it will be sent entirely free of cost. The price of any sets sold 
separately will be $2.00 each. 



The Portfolio will contain portraits of

Or for 25 cents we will send sample sheet as above, the current 

number of OUT WEST, and one older number.

"THE service we render to librarians and book

and the supplying of all books ordered, is most 
efficient and thorough. 

TWO REASONS 

1 Our stock is larger and more general than 
that of any other house in the United States. 

2 Our extensive experience, gained from 
constant attention to library orders, enables 
us to give much practical information and 
many suggestions to book buyers. 



The book catalogues we publish are considered 
the best and most complete issued by any com- 
mercial house — one of our catalogues includes

Freedom and Responsibility 

By ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY, President of Yale 
12mo, $1.00 net (postage 10 cents) 

" The author's main thesis is to show the 
historical connection between liberty and re- 
sponsibility, in morals, religion, law, industry, 
and politics. Freedom is treated as a privilege 
which should be conferred on the individual 
only in connection with the assumption by 
him of a certain measure of responsibility. 
The tendency of many people at the present 
day to claim the political rights of free citizens 
without assuming the corresponding moral 
obligations the author laments as an evil sign 
of the times. Underlying the relation between 
the two is the ethical basis of democracy, 
which cannot be ignored without fatal results." 
— Philadelphia Ledger.

" Our great business and political problem is to provide those 
new means of control to secure the responsibility of men under 
new conditions. And the ultimate seat of such control must 
be in individual character. Men must realize their duty to the 
State as superior to their right to act in politics for their own 
selfish interests. They must realize their duty in business to 
apply the ethics of honorable personal conduct to the imper- 
sonal transactions of vast corporations. They must accept 
the new moral responsibilities correlative with new extensions 
of power. President Hadley's discussion of these themes is, 
throughout, on a high plane, worthy of him and of the great 
University he represents." — New York Tribune.

A PERVERTED TRUST. 



We quote the following words from a recent 
number of " The Educational Review ": 

" Complaint is heard in England from South African 
educators that whatever may be the merits of the scheme 
adopted for the award of Rhodes scholarships, that 
scheme is in flat contradiction to the founder's will and 
expressed intention. It is claimed that Mr. Rhodes had 
no wish to establish post-graduate courses at Oxford, 
but rather to bring students from other English-speaking 
countries under the influence of the Oxford undergradu- 
ate system." 

We believe the stricture to be entirely just, 
and the case affords a fresh illustration of a 
tendency that is frequently met with among 
men who are charged with the responsibility 
of administrating trust funds devised for edu- 



cational or other purposes. Whether the in- 
tention of Cecil Rhodes in founding his Oxford 
scholarships was wisely conceived is not now 
the question ; the intention itself was distinctly 
formulated, and his trustees have distinctly lent 
themselves to its perversion. 

While the terms of the will under which the 
Rhodes scholarships are instituted do not state 
in absolutely explicit words that the benefici- 
aries shall be boys just entering college, it is 
impossible to read the document attentively 
without perceiving that such was the wish of 
the testator. The colonial schools which are 
expressly named as having the right to send 
scholars are preparatory schools in the strict 
sense, and the entire tenor of the will makes 
it evident that the writer had schoolboys in 
mind rather than university students midway 
in their career. In proof of this assertion we 
need do no more than quote the following 
words : " I direct that in the election of a stu- 
dent to a scholarship regard shall be had to 
. . . his exhibition during school days of 
moral force of character and of instincts to lead 
and to take an interest in his schoolmates." 
The sort of Oxford student whom Cecil Rhodes 
had in mind was clearly the English public 
school boy of seventeen or "eighteen and not 
the student having several years of college life 
behind him, the impressionable youth and not 
the man of mature ideals. 

As a preliminary to their administration of 
the Rhodes foundation, the trustees of the will 
appointed Dr. Parkin, the president of a Cana- 
dian college, to make a careful study of edu- 
cational conditions in the colonies and in 
America, and report a detailed plan of pro- 
cedure. This report was duly made, and as a 
consequence thereof, the trustees have published 
a " memorandum" for American educators, set- 
ting forth the details of the plan which they 
have adopted. The essential feature of this 
" memorandum " is found in the following 
sections : 

" It has been decided that all scholars shall have 
reached at least the end of their Sophomore or second 
year work at some recognized degree-granting univer- 
sity or college of the United States. 

" Scholars must be unmarried, must be citizens of 
the United States, and must be between nineteen and 
twenty-five years of age." 

Under these conditions it is fair to assume

[Jan. 16, 



that the successful candidates will be university 
graduates, or men not far from graduation, and 
that their average age will be nearer the maxi- 
mum than the minimum limit here fixed. Thus 
the purpose of the testator will be completely 
thwarted, and his estate be put to a use abso- 
lutely unwarranted by the terms of his will. 

It is not difficult to understand how this 
result has been brought to pass. Dr. Parkin, 
himself a college president, travelled through 
the United States consulting college presidents 
right and left, and got from them the advice 
that was to be expected. Obviously, this was 
too good a thing to be given up ; here was an 
educational prize of an unprecedented value, 
and no mere scruples based upon the wishes of 
the testator could weigh for much in compari- 
son with the importance of annexing such an 
opportunity to the sphere of university influ- 
ence. With practical unanimity these coun- 
sellors declared that it would never do to bestow 
the Khodes scholarship upon boys just out of 
school, that the benefits of the foundation would 
be far better appreciated by men of university 
training. Incidentally, the importance of every 
higher institution in the country would be en- 
hanced by its being able to hold out to its 
students the prospect of a possible Rhodes ap- 
pointment. It is not the point to insist that 
these considerations are reasonable ; it may be 
that they are. The point is that they set at 
naught the intentions of the founder, and use 
his bequest for a purpose totally different from 
that designated in his will. 

The real reason for the decision to send 
university students, and even university gradu- 
ates, to Oxford as the beneficiaries of the Rhodes 
fund has been made sufficiently evident by the 
foregoing statements. The ostensible reason 
will doubtless be found in the plea that our 
American public school and academy graduates 
are not as well prepared for university work as 
are the boys sent from Eton and Harrow. 
This is undoubtedly true, for the reason that 
our schools do not restrict their work almost 
exclusively, as the English schools do, to pre- 
paration in mathematics and the classics. The 
average American sohool graduate would find 
the " responsions " test, with its requirements 
of prose composition and advanced reading, 
beyond his powers. But the force of the ob- 
jection vanishes clean out of sight when we 
consider that the question is not of sending 
students to Oxford in large numbers, but of 
finding one picked student every year or two 
in each State who is equal to the test. Now 



there is not the slightest doubt that each of 
the United States could provide annually one 
or more students fully equipped to pass "re- 
sponsions," students quite the equal of the 
average product of an English public school. 
This objection disposed of, we fail to see any 
other that might reasonably be urged in de- 
fence of the plan now formulated. If that plan 
be persisted in, the wishes of the testator will 
be thwarted in their most vital aspect. 

The plan as now made public throws the 
whole weight of administration into the hands 
of our universities. Each State has a com- 
mittee for the selection of candidates, and in 
each case the chairman of that committee is 
the president of some university. The ma- 
chinery is now complete, and within a few 
weeks the process of selecting Rhodes scholars 
" between nineteen and twenty-five years of 
age " will be in active operation. We take no 
particular pleasure in recalling the fact that 
this perversion of the trust was foreseen by us, 
and the danger clearly pointed out, when we 
commented upon " The Rhodes Benefaction " a 
year ago last May. We spoke then of the like- 
lihood that the methods decided upon would 
be determined by our " educational moguls," 
and our argument had for its most important 
conclusion " the simple one that college and 
university interests should not have the pre- 
dominant voice in the administrative organiza- 
tion," but that " the men who stand officially 
for the larger educational systems of States 
and cities, together with the men who stand 
for the secondary educational interest most 
directly affected by the Rhodes endowment, 
should prove the main reliance for its efficient 
administration." 

That view of the matter has been, as we 
feared it would be, completely ignored by those 
who are responsible for the administration of 
the fund, and we have no idea that they will 
now reconsider their decision. But we have felt 
it our duty to make the present protest, and its 
seriousness will be better understood after the 
lapse of another two years, when a hundred 
Rhodes scholars from this country will be 
living in Oxford, scattered among the many 
colleges, it is true, yet forming a class by 
themselves, several years older than their En- 
glish undergraduate associates, pursuing more 
advanced studies, and missing almost com- 
pletely the community of fellowship and the 
sympathy of social interest that it was the man- 
ifest desire of Cecil Rhodes to create and to 
stimulate.

A POLEMIC O N CO D-FISHERIES. 

The cod-fishery is the principal business of the 
little Basque islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon; 
and since the French government offers a bounty 
upon all the product of the fishery which is sold out 
of France, the fishermen of these islands have an 
advantage over the Newfoundland fishermen which 
gives rise to many disputes and animosities. I was 
repeatedly told at St. Pierre that the people who 
lived on the adjacent coasts of Newfoundland were 
pirates ; that they would not aid the French fisher- 
men, even in distress ; and that whenever a fishing 
vessel was wrecked on their shores, everything was 
stolen. The cry of " Per/w^e Albion " finds its echoes 
among the fogs of the Newfoundland banks ; and 
there are controversial writings, elaborate and pas- 
sionate, over the wrongs committed in these distant 
waters by the Saxon upon the Gaul. 

I have before me a large octavo volume, with 
tables, maps, and illustrations, setting forth the 
grievances of the French fishermen. It is entitled, 
" The French at Newfoundland, and on the Shores 
of North America. The Great Cod Fishery of New- 
foundland, since the Discovery of the New World by 
the Basques in the 14th Century. By Adolf Bellet."* 
Although written as late as 1902, it sounds like a 
controversial writing of the Middle Ages. It opens 
with a stately exordium celebrating the glories 
of the fishing industry ever since the creation of man. 
The first chapter is therefore entitled "As Old as 
the World." Then the author descends from gen- 
eralities to specialties ; from the world at large to 
France; from fishing as a whole to cod-fishing in 
particular ; and he declares that 

" If France is not the first country in the world where cod- 
fishing has been raised to the state of a national industry, she 
is at any rate in the first rank of maritime nations which are 
devoted to it, and notwithstanding all her political storms, 
notwithstanding the dark days of mourning through which 
she has passed, the disasters she has undergone, and which, 
on repeated occasions have ruined ' from turret to foundation 
stone ' both her national marine and the immense colonial 
empires she has founded, this industry, still flourishing after 
more than five centuries, has been perpetuated across the 
ages, and yet remains as active as on the day of its birth. 
It is precisely this extraordinary vitality, which nothing has 
yet been able to reach, that exasperates and enrages our 
foreign competitors, and especially the English." 

This patriotic Frenchman next throws a new 
flood of light upon the question of the discovery of 
America. It seems that the reputations of Colum- 
bus and Leif Ericsson are mideserved, since the 
real discoverers of America were the Basques ! 
M. Bellet tells us that while the expedition by the 
Northman was soon forgotten, it was not the same 
with the French Basques. He says : 

" It is to this first landing ef the whale fishermen of Cape 
Breton, on the shores of Newfoundland, that we should trace 
the true discovery of the new world, and the establishment 
of the first route really commercial between Europe and 
America I Unfortunately it is impossible to give a fixed date 
to this historical event. What we can affirm is, that it pre- 
ceded by a century and a half the first expedition of Colum- 

* Published in Paris by A. Challamel, 1902. 



bus ; which, besides, was only organized by the Genoese navi- 
gator, upon the information given by other Basques, whom 
the wind had driven upon the Antilles about the year 1480." 

And here M. Bellet tells of a Basque pilot, who, 
after twenty-nine days of storm, found an island 
without a name, which it is believed must have been 
San Domingo ! Out of his crew of seventeen men, 
only five got back to Terceira (one of the Azores ) ; 
but one of these was the pilot, who took up his 
lodging in the house of Columbus, who was then 
making navigation charts, and it was upon this 
pilot's story that Columbus formed the design of 
discovering America ! This anecdote (related by 
one M. Fournier, " whose learning is beyond ques- 
tion ") must greatly weaken the aureole of glory and 
of genius of the Genoese sailor, "which an unreason- 
able enthusiasm . . . had consecrated as the great 
discoverer of continents, since Columbus did not 
himself discover the route of the Antilles, but merely 
followed a track which had been pointed out to 
him." It would seem that a series of monuments 
to the Basque fishermen is now in order. 

But the great object of the book is to justify the 
exclusive rights of France to what is known as the 
French Shore of Newfoundland, comprising the 
Western and part of the Northeastern coast. The 
author, after claiming for his country in the past a 
vast colony, extending from Baflfin's Bay to the 
Gulf of Mexico, of which the French were unjustly 
despoUed by England, declares that in the treaty 
of Utrecht in 1713 the fishermen caused to be in- 
serted a clause protecting their rights on this French 
shore. Article 13 declares that Newfoimdland and 
the adjacent islands should belong absolutely to 
Great Britain; that France should not establish any 
habitation therein except scaffolds and cabins neces- 
sary for drying fish; nor should the French land 
upon the island at any other time than was proper 
for fishing, nor on any part of the island except 
from Cape Bona Vista up to the northern end and 
thence along the west coast to Pointe Riche. This 
treaty receives from M. Bellet the very liberal con- 
struction that it was equivalent to a division of the 
island between the two nations ! 

Gradually, we are told, the wicked aggressions of 
the English deprived the French of their just rights. 
The English colonists became accustomed to the 
occupation of fishing, which they had at first dis- 
dained ; but when, fifty years afterwards, the treaty 
of Paris took away Canada from France, the rights 
of the French fishermen to the French shore were 
confirmed, and as a base of operations England ceded 
to France the two little islands of St. Pierre and 
Miquelon. Again, by the treaty of Versailles, after 
the American Revolution, these unconscionable and 
astute Englishmen, " in spite of the successes obtained 
by our fleets during the wai-, found the means of 
despoiling us of part of the coast which belonged to 
us for sixty-six years, under the pretext of rectifi- 
cation of boundaries, or rather exchange of coast, and 
took away from us the richest parts of the French 
shore, the most accessible for our fishermen, and 



38 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



replaced them by a more distant shore with fewer 
fish on the west coast. All the advantage was in 
favor of England." But an act additional to this 
treaty provided that the king of England would 
take positive measures to prevent his subjects from 
troubling by their competition the French fishermen 
during the temporary exercise of their right on the 
coasts of Newfoundland, and would withdraw any 
settlements established there. The French were to 
erect nothing but their scafPoldings, limiting them- 
selves to repairing the other buildings they had 
constructed, and not wintering there ; and the En- 
glish were not to molest them nor disturb their 
scaffoldings during their absence. 

The controversy between the two nations, as set 
forth by M. Bellet, also involves the important 
question of the definition of the lobster and the 
crab. It will be remembered that in an early En- 
glish dictionary the crab was defined to be a small 
red fish which walks backward ; whereupon a critic 
remarked that the definition was perfect, except 
that the crab was not red, was not a fish, and did 
not walk backward. The people of Newfoundland 
now deny to the French the right to take lobsters 
on the French shore, on the ground that the lobster 
is not a fish. This, M. Bellet denounces as a great 
wrong, for the reason that the lobster was a fish when 
the treaty was made ! He says : "The lobster, like 
the crab, was regarded as a true fish, and naturalists 
currently classified it in the category of shell-fish; 
and the expression ' to fish for lobster,' which was 
then the only one used, has been continued every- 
where throughout the fishing world." 

In accordance with the declaration of 1783, says 
M. Bellet, England prohibited the colonization of 
the French shore of Newfoundland. Roads could 
not be made, nor houses constructed, nor lands en- 
closed, within a zone of six miles from the coast ; but 
in 1810 the Home Government began to act differ- 
ently, and the English colonists have succeeded in 
establishing settlements upon several points of this 
shore, so that there are now more than 15,000 in- 
habitants there. The French neglected to expel 
these English settlers, and naturally they grew in 
number and in boldness. 

In 1854 England gave an autonomous govern- 
ment to Newfoimdland, "which now thinks that it 
has become a veritable power, and is unwilling to 
bear the servitude which rests as a burden upon its 
national patrimony for the profit of Frenchmen." 

In 1857 a convention was signed at London which 
gave to the French the exclusive right of using the 
French shore for fishing purposes during the fishing 
season, from April to October of each year, and 
provided that the French subjects should have the 
right to buy bait upon the south shore of Newfound- 
land (part of the English shore), on the same footing 
as English subjects. It was further provided that 
the coast reserved for the exclusive right of the 
French should extend from a third to a half a mile 
inland, and that no English enclosure and construc- 
tion should be made or maintained on the French 



shore except for military defence or public admini- 
stration. 

One would think that it would be self-evident that 
the conditions prescribed by this convention could 
not continue indefinitely. According to these terms, 
the English cannot use the shores of their own island, 
however valuable these may be ; nor can the French 
use them, except temporarily, during the fishing 
season and for fishing purposes alone. To tie up 
natural resources in this way, permanently and use- 
lessly, is clearly impossible ; yet it is the purpose of 
the treatise of M. Bellet to insist that this shall be 
done. Naturally, the Newfoundlanders will establish 
settlements, construct railways, and build cities, 
wherever the needs of the country require it, no 
matter what the treaties may be ; and it would be 
the part of wisdom to make some exchange of terri- 
tory by which the land could all be used. But this 
is precisely what M. Bellet insists shall not be done. 
After a panegyric upon the activity which reigns 
upon the little desert islands of Miquelon and St. 
Pierre, the two points which France has been able to 
wrest from " Britannic rapacity," he insists that no 
part of the French shore shall ever be surrendered. 

" We have seen the French Basques discovering the New 
World more than a hundred years before Columbus, and 
establishing fishing stations, the first foothold of Europeans 
on the American Continent. While we claim for our people 
the honor of being pioneers of the first trans-atlantic route, 
we are happy to be able to cast upon others, less scrupulous 
of the choice of means, the horror of the almost complete 
destruction of the race of aborigines, whose honor, sweetness 
and generosity are recognized by impartial judges ! ... It is 
not for vain glory that we would maintain ourselves upon 
the French shore, nor is it to injure the interests of the New- 
foundlanders, nor to draw from them a petty revenge for all 
the chicaneries of which they have been guilty for more than 
two centuries. We rise above all these little meannesses, 
and the only motive which moves us in the affair is the 
defense of the higher interests of the French codfishing in- 
dustry. The French shore of Newfoundland is the stumbling- 
block of our American fisheries, the foundation and the sine 
qua non on which rests the future of our codfishing industry. 
We offer here only two arguments in support of this thesis ; 
but they are decisive and irrefutable. The first relates to 
the cod itself ; the second rests upon the question of bait, 
without which the fishery would become impossible. On the 
point of the cod, we have said that this fish, without being 
migratory, is essentially a traveller. He has during these 
last years almost completely disappeared from the French 
shore ; and it is precisely this disappearance which has led 
to our progressive abandonment of the place where our fisher- 
men formerly went to seek him. Who, then, can assure us 
that, by a contrary phenomenon, he will not come to abandon 
the banks where we are now actively exercising our industry, 
to return again to the shores which have been conceded to us ? " 

M. Bellet becomes equally irresistible in his logic 
when he approaches the question of bait. The 
Government of Newfoundland passed an act forbid- 
ding Newfoundlanders to sell bait to the French- 
men. For the time, this act has not caused much 
mischief, since the French have been able to catch 
other kinds of bait on the banks, far out from land ; 
but this other bait is becoming more scarce, and 
perhaps they may have to return to the French 
shore. 

"It is therefore absolutely necessary to keep the whole 
of that shore. If the Newfoundlanders want to exploit the 



1904.]

mines there, or build railroads, a commission might be chosen 
to select for them, for a just compensation, certain points, — 
but to abandon our rights upon the shore, even in part, we 
must never think of it ! Better deliver to them our entire 
national fleet, for we could rebuild it; but if we abandon 
Newfoundland, we cannot find the sailors to equip the ships 
that assure our national defense. It is by the great fishery 
that we planted ourselves first in the New World of North 
America ; and it is for the purpose of defending this industry 
that we must remain there at whatever cost. The superior 
interest of our country demands it." 

Such is the French side of this interesting con- 
troversy, a controversy which does not seem any- 
where near a settlement. 

It would look as though French seamanship were 
in pretty bad straits, if the maintenance of the 
Newfoimdland codfishing is necessary to its preser- 
vation. Germany, with natural facilities infinitely 
more limited than France, has been able without 
any such aids to establish a merchant marine as 
well as a navy which is respected everywhere. If 
there be any difficulty with the French upon the 
sea, it proceeds more from the peculiar Gallic tem- 
perament than from the lack of facilities for mari- 
time activity. Most Frenchmen are not fond of 
the water ; and they are too much enamored of the 
delights of their own beautiful France to be willing 
to abandon them for the trackless paths of "the 
unharvested sea." 

I had a striking illustration of the incompetency 
of French seamanship upon my return from St. 
Pierre to Cape Breton. The captain of the " Pro 
Patria," on my outward voyage, was a man of con- 
siderable experience, who had commanded the vessel 
for a number of years. But he was dismissed sum- 
marily on landing at St. Pierre, not because of any 
complaint against him personally, but because he 
was related by marriage to certain persons who were 
obnoxious to the new proprietor of the vessel. In 
his place there was appointed the captain of one of 
the fishing-craft coming to St. Pierre, a man who 
was not only without knowledge of the course of the 
vessel (which is intricate and difficult), but who had 
never been in command of a steam vessel before. 
Luckily, however, on my return voyage the old cap- 
tain was on board the steamer as a passenger on lus 
way to France. It was a beautiful moonlight night 
when we steamed out of the harbor, — an impossible 
night, one would think, for a commanding officer to 
lose his vessel. Yet on the following morning the 
captain called his predecessor up on the bridge, and, 
pointing to a coast ahead, asked him what land that 
was. He was told that it was Ingonish and North 
Cape. In a single night he had gone more than 
twenty miles out of his course ! A few hours later, 
while I was at breakfast, there was a tremendous 
crash. I asked the cabin-boy what was the matter, 
and he answered, "Oh, it's nothing but the wharf! " 
and going on deck I found that we had dexterously 
taken ofp a corner of the pier at North Sidney. 
French seamanship will hardly become an object 
of admiration so long as such things occur.

Bismarck and his Empbror.* 



Since the death of Prince Bismarck, a large 
amount of biographical material and several 
formal biographies have appeared. The result 
is that to-day the world at large knows, or may 
know, the Iron Chancellor more fully, and may 
understand better the definite trend of his whole 
policy, than was possible during his life-time 
for any except the few who were favored with 
his personal friendship and intimate confidence. 
His letters to his wife revealed a side of his 
nature of which the public had little idea ; ten- 
derness and sentiment are not qualities that had 
been generally attributed to him. In similar 
fashion, though not in so great a degree, the 
recently published volumes of Correspondence 
between William I. and Bismarck not only 
throw new light upon the Emperor's policy, 
but bring out most clearly the characters of 
both men, and especially that of Bismarck as 
the German citizen and Prussian subject. The 
volumes also contain much material of value to 
the close student of the Bismarck period, and 
even serve to confirm or to modify views that 
are already coming to be accepted as historicaL 
To the ordinary reader, however, it is the for- 
mer aspect of the work that will be the more 
interesting ; and from that point of view it is 
worth while devoting a little space to its exam- 
ination. 

One of the most striking characteristics of 
the letters is the tone of sincere personal friend- 
ship and warm affection that runs through the 
notes not purely official. "Your faithfully 
devoted Wilhelm," " Your affectionate King," 
and, added in the Emperor's own hand, "Your 
faithfully devoted friend Wilhelm," are exam- 
ples of the royal signature. The Chancellor,, 
for whom etiquette dictated simply " v. Bis- 
marck" as the proper form, frequently ex- 
presses in the body of his communication the 
most cordial sentiments. One rather long pas- 
sage deserves to be cited. In acknowledging 
a gift from his sovereign, on the occasion of his 
silver wedding, Bismarck wrote: 

" Your Majesty justly emphasizes happiness in the 
home as being among the chief blessings for which I 
have to thank God ; but part of the happiness in my 
house, for my wife as well as myself, comes from the 
conscionsness of your Majesty's satisfaction, and the

exceedingly gracious and kindly words of appreciation 
which your Majesty's letter contains are naore beneficial 
to afflicted nerves than is all medical assistance. In 
looking back over my life, I have such inexhaustible 
cause to thank God for His unmerited mercy, that I 
often fear everything will not go so well with me until 
the end. I recognize it as an especially happy dispen- 
sation that God has called me on earth to the service 
of a master whom I serve joyfully and with love, as the 
innate fidelity of the subject never has to fear, under 
your Majesty's leadership, coming into conflict with a 
warm feeling for the honour and the welfare of the 
Fatherland." 

This note of cordial personal attachment is 
sounded again and again by the Emperor, nut 
only in connection with gifts and honors con- 
ferred upon his eminent servant, but even more 
strikingly in his emphatic protests against even 
entertaining the idea of Bismarck's retirement. 
Thus, in February, 1869, Wilhelm wrote: 

" How can you possibly imagine that I could even 
think of acceding to your idea ? It is my greatest hap- 
piness to live with you and to thoroughly agree with 
you. How can you be so hypochondriac as to allow 
one single difference [t. e., regarding a gift to the city 
of Frankfurt] to mislead you into taking the extreme 
step ? . . . Your name stands higher in Prussian his- 
tory than that of any other Prussian statesman. And 
I am to let that man go ? Never. Quiet and prayer 
will adjust everything. Your most faithful friend." 

The words in italics are twice underscored, in 
the last instance three times in the original. 
A few days later, in connection with the same 
matter, the Emperor wrote : 

" I understand all that [t. e., Bismarck's morbid state 
and exhaustion] perfectly well, for I feel the same ; but 
can or may I, for that reason, think of laying down my 
office ? Just as it is impossible for me to do that, so 
it is impossible for you ! You do not belong only to 
yourself; your existence is too closely bound up with 
the history of Prussia, of Germany, and of Europe, for 
you to withdraw from a scene of action which you have 
helped to create." 

After making some suggestions to lighten the 
minister's burdens, he adds : 

" Above all, never doubt my unaltered confidence 
and my unquenchable gratitude ! I " 

As is well known, there is some doubt just 
when and where the idea of turning the Ger- 
man Confederation into an empire originated. 
The question is too complicated for a discus- 
sion in this place, but it is worth while citing 
one or two statements by Wilhelm I. bearing 
upon it. On the occasion of the meeting of the 
first German Reichstag at Berlin, March 21, 
1871, his Majesty wrote to Bismarck : 

" It is to your counsel, your circumspection, your 
unwearying activity, that Prussia and Germany owe 
the world-historical occurrence which is embodied in 
my capital to-day." 

A year later, upon the anniversary of peace, 

he wrote : 



" We celebrate to-day the first anniversary of the 
glorious conclusion of peace, which was attained by 
bravery and sacrifices of all kinds, but through your 
circumspection and energy led to results which had 
never been dreamed of I " 

Again, in a letter of congratulation, he wrote, 
in July of the same year: 

" My prayers of thanksgiving . . . include thanks 
to God for having placed you at my side at a decisive 
moment, and thus opened up a career for my Govern- 
ment far exceeding thought and comprehension." 

In connection with Bismarck's distinguished 
services in founding the Empire, it is interest- 
ing to note his loyalty to Prussia. In 1869 
he wrote from St. Petersburg to Baron von 
Schleinitz, the Minister of State : 

" I should like to see the word * German ' written 
instead of ' Prussian ' on our banner only when we are 
bound more closely and more expediently to the rest of 
our countrymen than we are at present; it loses its 
charm when it is used too much in its Bundestag 
nexus." 

Nearly twenty years later, in acknowledging 
a fresh decoration conferred upon him, he 

wrote : 

" I have prayed to God more fervently than ever for 
the health which I need, in order to evince to your 
Majesty by deeds, as long as I live, my heartfelt grati- 
tude, and my fidelity as a born vassal of the Branden- 
burg ruling house." 

One passage of peculiar interest, as an ex- 
pression of Bismarck's ideal of a career, is 
found in a letter acknowledging the Emperor's 
Christmas gift of a copy of Ranch's monu- 
ment to Frederick the Great. He says : 

" I have always regretted that it was not permitted 
to me, according to the wishes of my parents, to mani- 
fest at the front rather than behind the writing-desk 
my attachment for the Royal House and my enthusiasm 
for the greatness and glory of the Fatherland. Even 
to-day, after your Majesty has raised me to the highest 
honours which a statesman can attain, I cannot quite 
suppress the regret that I have not won similiar pro- 
motion as a soldier. ... I should perhaps have been 
useless as a general, but if I had followed my own 
inclination I would rather have won battles for your 
Majesty . . . than diplomatic campaigns." 

So far, no mention has been made of the 
second, and in some respects more important, 
volume of the correspondence, — the letters 
other than those from and to Emperor Will- 
iam I. This volume includes some two hun- 
dred letters, of which about forty are from 
Bismarck, the others being addressed to him by 
various statesmen and royal persons. Space 
forbids any detailed examination of these, but 
one specially significant letter of 1859, showing 
Bismarck's far-sighted policy, deserves to be 
cited. He writes : 

" My eight years' experience at Frankfurt has con- 
vinced me that the Bund institutions are shackles on

Prussia, galling in times of peace, and absolutely dan- 
gerous to her existence at critical periods. . . . Per- 
haps I go too far when I suggest that we should eagerly 
seize every lawful opportunity to assume the role of the 
offended party, and out of this to attain the revision of 
our mutual relations which Prussia needs in order that 
she may live permanently in satisfactory relations with 
the smaller German states. ... In my eyes, our rela- 
tionship with the Bund is an infirmity of Prussia's which, 
sooner or later, we shall have to heal ferro et igni if we 
do not take a favorable opportunity to combat it in 
time." 

The letters given to the public in these two 
volumes were selected by Prince Bismarck 
himself, and were found after his death, ar- 
ranged in portfolios. The translation, made by 
Mr. J. A. Ford, is in every way satisfactory, 
and particularly so when one considers the diffi- 
culties of German epistolary style. As in the 
German edition, some facsimile reproductions 
have been included — fewer in the English, 
however, than in the German. All in all, the 
work is one of more than passing interest and 
value. It will be indispensable in any library 
that deals, except in the most general way, with 
recent German history.

American Moths.* 



In former times books with good colored 
illustrations of butterflies and moths were so 
expensive as to be quite beyond the means of 
ordinary individuals. Chromolithography, in 
the hands of experts, reached a high degree of 
excellence, and some very good works were 
published at fairly reasonable prices during the 
latter part of the nineteenth century. Indeed, 
the demand for such publications in England 
and Germany led to the appearance of an aston- 
ishing number of illustrated guides to various 
branches of entomology, which rendered the 
work of the amateur collector in those coun- 
tries comparatively easy. While it is true that 
these books appeared in response to a demand, 
they also served to create a further one, and 
80 the amateur study of natural phenomena be- 
came increasingly more prevalent and, I believe, 
more scientific. If I may judge from my own 
experience as a boy in England, the value of 
such literature to the cause of science can hardly 
be overestimated. In the old-fashioned schools 
of that country, science was practically ignored, 
and the student was obliged to resort to books 
and the public museums for information. The

excellence of these agencies, however, made it 
possible to progress satisfactorily ; and it is 
even open to question whether such means, in 
the hands of an interested student, were not 
after all superior to class-instruction. I believe 
a strong argument could be presented for the 
abandonment of formal instruction in science 
as a means of education, except in relation to 
certain manifest utilities and technical trades, 
and the substitution of something more like the 
apparently hap-hazard method of the English 
amateur. 

In the United States, the amateur ento- 
mologist has not been so favorably situated, 
and his tribe has not increased as fast as we 
could wish. The excellent publications of the 
Division of Entomology of the Department of 
Agriculture have been very helpful, and there 
have appeared several general handbooks, and 
some works on special groups. Nevertheless, 
even among the butterflies and moths it has 
been very difficult for collectors to accurately 
determine their own captures, and they have 
depended upon the assistance of specialists 
whenever it could be obtained. This condition 
of comparative ignorance and dependence has 
not been favorable to the development of orig- 
inality, and many who might no doubt have 
done good work have been checked at the out- 
set by the obstacles to be overcome. The 
publication, a few years ago, of Dr. Holland's 
" Butterfly Book " marked a long step towards 
remedying these conditions. The new " three- 
color " photographic process was here put to a 
fair test, and the results were remarkably sat- 
isfactory. For the first time, all except the 
smaller and more obscure butterflies of the 
United States were well figured in colors ; and 
the book, containing also good descriptions and 
much other matter, was sold at a price which 
made it accessible everywhere. Now we have 
before us a similar but somewhat larger book 
on the American moths, by the same author. 
As there are over six thousand moths known in 
this country, it was found impossible to figure 
them all, and for that matter very many of 
them are too small to be treated successfully 
by the means employed. It was also found 
necessary to omit the descriptions, leaving the 
student to determine his specimens from the 
pictures, aided by such information regarding 
particular features, distribution and habits as 
could be furnished within a small space. Not- 
withstanding these unavoidable deficiencies, 
there are pictures of one-fourth of the known 
species, including nearly all of the larger and

more conspicuous ones, and there is quite 8u£&- 
cient to give the student an excellent prelim- 
inary grasp of the subject. While the " Moth 
Book " is thus less complete than that on but- 
terflies, as compared with what was previously 
available it marks a considerably greater ad- 
vance, and from an amateur's point of view it 
puts the whole subject on an entirely new foot- 
ing. If it is necessary to replace it in a few 
years by something better, that will be the best 
proof of its success. 

Although the author took great pains to have 
the identifications of his moths correct, there are 
several errors, which have been pointed out by 
Dr. Dyar of the National Museum. In a future 
edition, these will of course be corrected, and 
one may perhaps be permitted to suggest that 
something more might be added concerning the 
characters which distinguish the various genera. 
It would also, I think, be an excellent plan to 
take a few more pages and give a full account 
(including all stages of development, distribu- 
tion, variation, natural enemies, etc.} of some 
one species, as a model for the student. One 
is a little afraid that there will be a tendency 
to merely match specimens with pictures, and 
forget that there is anything more to be done. 

Although this notice has been written with 
reference to the utility of the " Moth Book " 
to begineers and amateurs, it is proper to add 
that there is no specialist who will not find it 
of the utmost value. ^^ j^^ ^_ Cockerell. 



Abbott's Life of Bkecher.* 



In writing the biography of his distinguished 
friend and predecessor in Plymouth pulpit, Dr. 
Abbott aims, as his introduction states, to 
interpret Beecher's life and character. This 
purpose permits the writer to omit facts con- 
cerning ancestry and family life, obtainable 
elsewhere, and to utilize fully his intimate 
knowledge and sympathetic insight. These 
result from personal experience; for, as Dr. 
Abbott tells us, his life and theology were so 
revolutionized by Beecher in 1867 that he 
abandoned law for the ministry ; afterwards 
he helped Beecher prepare a special edition 
of sermons ; and still later, the two were 
for five years co-editors of "The Christian 
Union." That Dr. Abbott should attain distin- 

• Henry Ward Bebcbbr. By Lyman Abbott. Boston : 
Houghton, Mifflin &, Co. 



guished success in his interpretation was there- 
fore to be expected. 

As a chief means of understanding the per- 
sonality of Beecher, his conception of Christian 
truth and his two motives " love for God " and 
" desire for God's love " are explained and em- 
phasized until the reader perceives in them the 
key to Beecher's nature, to his intense activity 
and power of relaxation, to his courage and 
caution, his outspokenness and reserve, his self- 
confidence and self-depreciation, and also to his 
continually present and potent qualities, " the 
spontaneity of his humor, his love of beauty, the 
strength of his conscience, his chivalry toward 
women and children, and his transparent sin- 
cerity." To this portrayal, Dr. Abbott's own 
reminiscences lend life and value. For exam- 
ple, he thus describes a scene when, at his 
instigation, Beecher was endeavoring to revise 
the proof of a sermon : 

"He cut out here; interpolated there; again and 
again threw down the proof in impatience; again and 
again I took it up and insisted on his continuing the 
task. At last, sticking the pencil through the proof 
with a vicious stab, and throwing both upon the table 
before him, he said, < Abbott, the thing I wanted to say 
I didn't say; and the thing I didn't want to say I did 
say; and I don't know how to preach anyhow.'" 

Illustrations of Beecher's humor are numerous. 
Dr. Abbott says: 

" After I took the editorship of « The Christian 
Union ' I urged him to give his views on public ques- 
tions through its columns. ■ « As it is now,' I said, « any 
interviewer who comes to you gets a column from you; 
and the public is as apt to get your views in any other 
paper as in your own.' 'Yes,' he said, * I am like the 
town pump: anyone who will come and work the handle 
can carry o£E a pailful of water.' On one occasion I 
argued for Calvinism, that it had produced splendid 
characters in Scotland and in New England. 'Yes,* 
he replied, < Calvinism makes a few good men and 
destroys many mediocre men. It is like a churn: it 
makes good butter, but it throws away a lot of butter- 
milk.'" 

The Beecher herein interpreted is not 
simply a remarkable personality, but a writer, 
preacher, and orator ; and here too we catch 
Dr. Abbott's enthusiasm, as he illustrates 
and analyzes Beecher's power in the pulpit of 
Plymouth Church and in England. The chap- 
ter called " The Yale Lectures on Preaching " 
is an excellent piece of criticism. We like 
also his characterization of Beecher as com- 
pared with Webster, Phillips, Sumner, Gough, 
Gladstone, and other contemporary orators. 
Dr. Abbott points out Mr. Beecher's superi- 
ority to George William Curtis " in inflaming, 
convincing, coercing power," though lacking 
Curtis's "grace and perfect art"; his method

of reaching " the conscience through ideality," 
as contrasted with Finney's coercion through 
" logic aflame "; his spontaneity, and his use of 
illustrations from life, as opposed to Dr. Storrs's 
more artificial rhetoric and illustrations from 
books ; and the description of Phillips Brooks 
as " a greater preacher " and of Beecher as a 
" greater orator." Throughout the book the 
exposition of Beecher's oratory is such that we 
are left with Dr. Abbott's impression: 

" If the test of the oration is its perfection, whether of 
structure or of expression, other orators have surpassed 
Mr. Beecher; if the test of oratory is the power of the 
speaker to impart to his audience his life, to impress 
on them his conviction, animate them with his purpose, 
and direct their action to the accomplishment of his 
«nd, then Mr. Beecher was the greatest orator I have 
ever heard; and, in my judgment, whether measured 
by the immediate or the permanent effects of his ad- 
dresses, takes his place in the rank of the great orators 
•of the world." 

We are particularly grateful for the repre- 
sentation we here find of Beecher's scholarship 
and statesmanship, which the more brilliant 
qualities of his orations have obscured. In 
Beecher's speeches in England, Dr. Abbott 
discovers " great accuracy of historical infor- 
mation," "detailed acquaintance with the 
economic and industrial aspects of the slavery 
question," " clear apprehension of constitu- 
tional issues involved," and unanswerable 
logic. That Beecher had a statesman's clear- 
ness of insight and practical grasp of difficult 
situations, is continually made evident. Though 
aflame with anti-slavery fire, he was not an 
abolitionist, and foresaw the possible final 
overthrow of slavery by limiting its territory. 
Though a man who never lowered his ideals, 
his common-sense led him to insist upon prac- 
ticable methods. For example, though believ- 
ing in universal suffrage, he advocated that, 
in the case of the negroes, suffrage for a time 
be restricted by educational and property 
qualifications. He has been represented as 
inconsistent, not only by people who have 
over-emphasized seeming discrepancies in his 
statements, and by those to whom the merri- 
ment and reverence for which he was distin- 
guished seemed incompatible, but by those who 
misunderstood his shifting political affiliations 
and later theological views. Some of these 
inconsistencies are explained by this concep- 
tion of him as scholar and statesman. He 
always believed principles more binding than 
party, and his statesmanship led him to side 
with Andrew Johnson and the Democratic 
leaders in desiring the speedy *' restoration of 
all the States late in rebellion to their Federal 



relation," for " their own health, as indirectly 
the best policy for the freedmen, as peculiarly 
needful for the safety of our Government." 
Moreover, a life-long individualist and student 
of economics, he consistently believed in Free 
Trade, for which Mr. Cleveland stood ; and 
the fact that he spent years in studying Evolu- 
tion accounts for the new emphasis in his later 
preaching. The insignificance of the theo- 
logical adjustments that he found necessary, 
and his courage in advocating new truths years 
before their common acceptance, awaken his 
biographer's admiration. 

Dr. Abbott gives much information con- 
cerning American religious and political life 
during the last century. In Chapter I. we 
read that the legacy left by eighteenth- century 
Puritan theology was 

"A fear of God; a reverence for his law; a strenuous 
though narrow and conventional conscience; but also a 
religion divorced from ethics; a Church silent in the 
presence of intemperance and slavery; without mis- 
sionary zeal or missionary organization; threatened by 
the intellectual revolt which eventually carried from 
it some of its wisest and noblest men; and surrounded 
by a community lapsing into indifference and neglect 
or combining in open and cynical infidelity." 

Equally valuable is the account of the theology 
which regarded religion as a " form of life," 
and which, under the leadership of Horace 
Bushnell " the apostle of faith," Charles G. 
Finney " the apostle of hope," and Henry 
Ward Beecher " the apostle of love," succeeded 
in replacing Puritan rationalism. Chapter III. 
gives a picture of Cincinnati and Indianapolis 
in the thirties and forties, and a suggestive 
contrast between the methods then in vogue 
of fitting men for life and those used to-day. 
The chapter called " Parenthetical " contains 
a comprehensive and clearly defined exposition 
of the complications of the anti-slavery issue, 
and a description of the three parties that in 
1847 clashed in the North. In Chapter IV. 
are found a statement of the principles of 
Congregationalism, a comparison of Congre- 
gational and quartette singing, and a division 
of churches into two classes — the one empha- 
sizing worship, the other preaching ; the one 
building a cathedral, the other a " meeting- 
house." For classification, Dr. Abbott has a 
veritable genius, separating prayers into three 
groups, and lives of Christ into eight. 

Doubtless the introduction of so much that 
is but indirectly ancillary to the writer's main 
purpose greatly enriches the book. And such 
is Dr. Abbott's ability to summarize and sub- 
ordinate that this seemingly extraneous mat-

ter in no way impairs its structural unity. 
Thus our attention throughout centres on 
Mr. Beecher, *' a man of great spiritual and 
intellectual genius, whose faults were super- 
ficial, whose virtues were profound, whose 
influence will outlive his fame, and who has 
probably done more to change directly the 
religious life, and indirectly the theological 
thought in America, than any preacher since 
Jonathan Edwards."

A Seventeenth Century 

MUNCHHAUSEN.* 



One of the most interesting discussions in 
literary history has grown from the attempt to 
fix the responsibility for certain statements in 
Father Hennepin's later publications concern- 
ing the original exploration of the lower Mis- 
sissippi by members of the La Salle expedition. 
In 1673 Joliet and Father Marquette descended 
the Mississippi, by the gateway of the Wiscon- 
sin, as far south as the mouth of the Arkansas, 
returning by way of the Illinois river and Lake 
Michigan to Green Bay. Although these ex- 
plorers did not reach the mouth of the Mis- 
sissippi, they had gone far enough to determine 
that it had its outlet not in the '■*■ South Sea " 
but in the Gulf of Mexico. The chevalier 
La Salle, who for some years, from his deri- 
sively named outpost of La Chine on the St. 
Lawrence, had been seeking a way overland 
to China, caught a new inspiration from the 
new discovery, and turned his purposes from 
the West to the South. No longer a trade 
route to the further East but a French empire 
in the nearer Southwest, became the goal of 
his ambitions. 

That great pro-consul. Count Frontenac, 
whose name shines in the temple of fame along- 
side that of his less fortunate successor who 
perished on the heights of Abraham, was ruling 
in the French colony on the St. Lawrence. 
His vision was one with that of La Salle. Both 
saw a great opportunity for French ascendancy, 
political and commercial, in the still unoccupied 
valley of the Mississippi, where prompt meas- 
ures would plant a greater France and at the 
same time place an eternal barrier in the face 
of English aggression. Less intent upon the

personal welfare of the American Indian than 
upon the exploitation of the undeveloped re- 
sources of his broad lands, they looked at first 
with cold indifference on the noble services 
rendered to humanity by the Jesuit fathers. 
But their indifference changed to a more pos- 
itive disfavor when the plans for exploitation 
on the one hand and for salvation on the other 
clashed over an " Indian policy " in regard to 
" fire water " and other doubtful blessings of 
civilization. Consequently when La Salle's little 
band went out into the wilderness in 1678 they 
took with them as spiritual advisers and mis- 
sionaries four members of that more tractable 
religious brotherhood, the RecoUet Order of 
Franciscans. 

That one of this group who has become well 
known through his narrative of the expedition 
was Father Louis Hennepin. Born about 1640, 
in the province of Hainault in the Spanish 
Netherlands, he entered the RecoUet order 
while still a lad. But his spirit and his aspira- 
tions were hardly those of a friar and recluse. 
He says : 

" I was passionately in love with hearing the rela- 
tions that masters of ships gave of their voyages. I 
used oft-times to skulk behind the doors of victualling- 
houses to hear the seamen give an account of their 
adventures. This occupation was so agreeable and 
engaging that I have spent whole days and nights at 
it without eating; for hereby I always came to under- 
stand some new thing, concerning the customs and ways 
of living in remote places, and concerning the pleasant- 
ness, fertility, and riches of the countries where these 
men had been." 

After serving for a time as an army chaplain 
in the wars with France, his desires were grati- 
fied in 1675, when the superior of his order 
commanded him to sail with four others to the 
help of Frontenac in Canada. Going out on 
the same ship with La Salle he did not again 
come in touch with him until in 1678, when, 
again at the order of his superior in Paris, 
he joined La Salle for his great journey to 
the unexplored West. Two years were spent 
as chaplain at the outpost of Fort Frontenac 
on Lake Ontario, where, he says, "I gave 
myself much to the reading of voyages, and 
encreas'd the ambition I had to pursue my 
design of making this discovery." Another 
year was spent in convent at Quebec, " in order 
to prepare and sanctifie myself for commencing 
our discovery." In September, 1678, the party 
was made up, with La Salle at its head, 
ably seconded by Henri de Tonty, Hennepin, 
Ribourde, and Membi e, who were to carry the 
gospel to the western Indians.

The winter rendezvous was above the falls of 
Niagara, where a vessel of forty-five tons called 
the " Griffon " was built. On the seventh of 
August, 1679, the expedition sailed for Lake 
Michigan on this ship — the first keeled boat 
that ever navigated the great lakes. The win- 
ter of 1679-80 was spent on the Illinois River, 
where Fort Crevecoeur was built near Lake 
Peoria. At the beginning of March the party 
separated. La Salle with four companions re- 
turned to Frontenac for supplies, Tonty and 
fifteen Frenchmen remained to hold the out- 
post on the Illinois, and Father Hennepin, in 
company with Michael Accau and Antoine 
Augel, started on the now famous canoe voy- 
age to explore the Illinois to its junction with 
the Mississippi and to further ascend the latter 
river as far as feasible. Although Hennepin 
always poses as the leader of this expedition, 
Accau, who knew the Indian languages, was 
the official leader. But the man of the pen, 
as usual, has triumphed over him of the sword, 
and the fame of this daring adventure will 
always be Hennepin's. Captured by a party of 
Sioux near Lake Pepin, the little band of white 
men made an involuntary acquaintance with the 
higher reaches of the Mississippi as far as the 
Falls of St. Anthony. Here they were rescued 
by a party of five coureurs de hois led by 
that great adventurer and explorer, Daniel 
Greysolon du Lhut. This masterful man, who 
could go with safety almost alone among In- 
dians hostile to the white man, was welcomed 
with as much joy by the Sioux as by the pris- 
oners, and in his keeping the whole party of 
whites came out, by the Wisconsin and Win- 
nebago route, to spend the winter of 1680-81 
at Mackinac. 

In the summer of 1681 Hennepin was once 
more at Quebec, and in the fall he sailed for 
France and his career as an explorer ended. 
At the beginning of 1683 he published at Paris 
a work entitled " Description de la Louisiane," 
and its narrative of the events of the spring 
and summer of 1680 are fully authenticated 
in the independent narratives of La Salle and 
du Lhut. But while Hennepin at St. Germain 
in 1682 was writing his book. La Salle, who 
had returned to the Illinois country in 1681, 
was making his wonderful voyage down the 
Mississippi to the sea, and Father Membre 
was of his party. In 1690 was published 
Le Clercq's " Etablissement de la Foi," which 
contained Membre's narrative of that expedi- 
tion. But Le Clercq's book was almost imme- 
diately suppressed, and its contents and the 



achievements they narrated appear to have 
been known only to a few persons. Here was 
a literary opportunity that appealed to the 
mercurial mind of Hennepin. In 1697 he 
published at Utrecht his "Nouvelle Decouverte 
d'un tres grand Pays, situe dans I'Ameriqiie." 
In this volume he boldly appropriates Membre's 
narrative and La Salle's glory, and incorporates 
the voyage to the mouth of the Mississippi into 
his trip of 1680 as a preliminary to the voyage 
on the upper river. This claim was in the 
face of the statement in his earlier book that 
" the tribes that took us prisoners gave us no 
time to navigate this river both up and down." 
His party left the Illinois in a canoe about the 
twelfth of March, and were captured near 
Lake Pepin on the eleventh of April. Yet the 
latter book claims for this month a canoe voy- 
age of 3300 miles, two-thirds of the distance 
against the current of the Father of Waters ! 

All the authorities, with one exception, from 
Jared Sparks to Mr. Thwaites, have duly char- 
acterized the mendacity of Hennepin, who if 
an honest man might have achieved a worthy 
fame with one immortal voyage and one praise- 
worthy book. The exception is John Gilmary 
Shea. In his " Discovery and Exploration of 
the Mississippi," published in 1852, Mr. Shea 
joins in the general condemnation of Hennepin's 
monumental " steal," but in his " Hennepin's 
Description of Louisiana," published in 1880, 
he puts forward the ingenious theory that 
Hennepin was the guileless victim of a sup- 
posititious editor whom Broedelet, the Utrecht 
publisher, employed to refashion Hennepin's 
genuine narrative. A detailed investigation of 
the whole matter leads one to follow Mr. 
Thwaites when he says : " A careful compari- 
son between Louisiane and its successors leads 
us irresistibly to the conclusion that, as Shea 
originally held, the blame must rest upon the 
shoulders of Hennepin quite as much as upon 
those of his publishers." 

This imposture, the "Nouvelle Decouverte," 
published in 1697, while containing Henne- 
pin's true voyage, and much other matter 
true and false, omits the valuable accounts of 
the Indian life and manners contained in the 
" Louisiane." However, it went through many 
editions speedily, and was translated into nu- 
merous languages. In 1698 a third work of 
his, the " Nouveau Voyage d'un Pais plus 
grand que I'Europe," was published at Utrecht. 
This is a patchwork of Indian customs from 
the " Louisiane " and travels by La Salle 
and others from Le Clercq. The same year 



46

was published at London an English transla- 
tion of Hennepin's works entitled " A New 
Discovery of a Vast Country in America." 
This consists practically of the "Nouvelle 
Deeouverte " and the " Nouveau Voyage," with 
some added material cribbed from earlier trav- 
ellers. It is this English translation or version 
that Mr. Thwaites has undertaken to edit, so 
that with Shea's reprint of 1880 we may have 
a complete set of the voyages by Hennepin. 
The work, as we expect from this editor, has 
been splendidly done. An introduction deals 
with the career and literary duplicity of the 
author, and Mr. Victor Hugo Paltsits of the 
Lenox Library furnishes the first accurate 
bibliography of Hennepin. Excellent copies 
of the original maps and engravings are in- 
cluded. The publishers have given this accu- 
rate reproduction a worthy setting in paper, 
print, and binding to delight a book lover. 
Besides the regular edition, in two volumes, 
there are 160 numbered copies beautifully 
printed on handmade paper.

CL.OTHES AND COSTUMK IN AMERICA.* 



The unbeliever who has read all the books 
that have been written on colonial times, would 
have said that there was not enough material 
left for another. But he would have under- 
rated both the potency of Mrs. Alice Morse 
Earle's divining-rod, and the richness of trea- 
sure which lurks in the subject of clothes. 
That potency and richness are proved by two 
ample and sumptuous volumes recently pro- 
duced by Mrs. Earle under the title " Two 
Centuries of Costume in America." 

Being content, for the most part, to leave 
the deeper and vaguer phases of her subject to 
Carlyle, who as a mere man and philosopher 
cannot enter with joy into the details of actual 
dress, and having moreover disposed of the 
more scientific side in " Customs and Fashions 
in Old New England," Mrs. Earle is free in the 
present work to revel in all the gorgeousness 
of historic finery. And what an array she

Puritans, through the ugly ornateness of Res-

conceits, the "witless bravery " of hoop skirts, 
and the immodest scantiness of Empire fash- 
ions, — all are here, described in Mrs. Earle's 
piquant style, and made real by a wealth of 
illustrations which form a treasure-house in 
themselves. The author's love of the glint and 
rustle of brocade and the soft witchery of gauze 
and lace is testified on every page ; and who- 
ever does not feel a responding love in his own 
soul is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. 
Let not the eternal masculine scoff. He will 
love to read of his past glories, or he is not of 
the same race as the Boston groom of whom it 
is recorded that " his dress was so much more 
striking than the bride's that she had a hearty 
fit of crying over it." 

Historically, of course, the book is of great 
value, especially the chapters on the Evolution 
of Coats and Waistcoats, and of Pantaloons 
and Pantalets. Shorn of the embroidery of 
quaint terms and clever phrases, some of the 
interesting general facts which are developed 
are these : that as a class Americans from 
1650 to i860 dressed more expensively and 
fashionably than Englishmen; that men were 
not less gorgeously clad than women, nor less 
anxious to be in " the high kick of fashion "; 
that " the most devoted follower of fashion in 
the present day gives no more heed to dress 
and the modes than did the early American 
Colonists"; and that even the Puritan who 
dressed in " sad color " was not necessarily 
sombre in attire, since "sad color" included 
purple and green, and many a Puritan wore 
a red waistcoat. 

It is dangerous to quote, for there is no place 
to stop. But one cannot resist repeating the 
mere words in this list of colors : 

" Billymot, phillymurt, or philomot (feuille-mort), 
murry, gridolin (gris-de-lin or flax blossom), puce 
color, Kendal green, Lincoln green, barry, milly, stam- 
mel red, zaffer-blue." 

This is irresistible, too, though the tribute is 
to an Englishman : 

'< The guards of lace a finger broad laid on over the 
seams of the gown are described by Pepys in his day. 
He had some of these guards of gold lace taken from 
the seams of one of his wife's old gowns to overlay the 
seams of one of his own cassocks and rig it up for wear, 
just as he took his wife's old muff, like a thrifty husband, 
and bought her a new muff, like a kind one. . . . Really 
a seventeenth century husband was not so bad." 

Here is a description of the ornaments of 
headdresses which shows what extravagancies 
our ancestors were capable of : 

" It would be idle to enumerate the various designs

Mrs. Earle dedicates her book very aptly 
and deservedly to Mr. George P. Brett, Presi- 
dent of the Macmillan Company. Happy 
indeed is the author who can apply to her pub- 
lisher the words which poor George Wither, 
after many vexations at the hands of the

A Century of Expansion.* 



In his account of "A Century of Expansion" 
Mr. Johnson has sought to do more than write 
a mere sketch of territorial acquisitions by the 
United States. In the first place, his concep- 
tion of his subject is such that he finds it 
necessary to devote a third of his book to a 
description of conditions and events prior to 
the first accession of territory under the Con- 
stitution. The forces which rendered American 
expansion " not only possible but inevitable " 
are declared to have " preceded the formation 
or even the conception of the Republic " — in 
fact to have been "anticipated in the very 
circumstances of the Columbian discovery." 
More striking than this is the scope which 
Mr. Johnson attaches to the term "expansion." 
*' The history of American expansion," he says, 
*' is something far more than a record of geo- 
graphical extension, or even of wars and treaties. 
It involves the history, in large measure, of 
constitutional development and interpretation, 
of domestic institutions, of foreign relations, 
and of our whole national life." This, of 
course, makes of expansion an exceedingly vast 
subject. The author disclaims any intention 
to do more than present, in a spirit of candor 
and impartiality, the salient features of the

great story. The history of American expan- 
sion is recognized to be not all " pride and 
sunshine." " The nation," we read, " has not 
always acted wisely and well. There are things 
to condemn as well as to commend. Acts are 
not always necessarily right just because our 
country performs them." This is sound doc- 
trine, and while it does not represent any new 
revelation, it cannot be preached with too 
great frequency. It is gratifying to encounter 
a writer who proclaims the truth so straight- 
forwardly. 

Mr. Johnson writes thus from such a whole- 
some point of view, and draws the bold outlines 
of his subject in such a convincing manner, 
that one cannot but regret the more deeply 
his occasional superficiality and carelessness in 
handling details. It would be an easy matter 
to make up a long list of more or less serious 
errors into which he has fallen. For instance, 
it was in 1716, not 1718, that Lieutenant- 
Governor Spotswood and his fifty " Knights 
of the Golden Horseshqg " crossed the Blue 
Ridge. And why spell it "Spottswood " ? 
The worthy gentleman himself did not do so. 
Pittsburg is spoken of as existing in 1764, 
although " the Forks " did not bear that name 
until nearly a decade later. The story of a 
Jesuit college at Kaskaskia in the first quarter 
of the eighteenth century, as ridiculous as it is 
oft-repeated, is scrupulously preserved. The 
extent of westward migration prior to the 
Revolution is considerably exaggerated. The 
fact of George Rogers Clark's conquest of the 
Northwest in 1778-79 played no part in the 
peace negotiations at Paris in 1782, though 
the contrary is here strongly implied. Western 
state-making during the Revolution is very in- 
adequately treated. It is certainly quite un- 
necessary to explain Clark's acquiescence in 
Genet's intrigues for the alienation of the 
West from the United States on the theory 
that he was " partially insane "; else such in- 
sanity must have been frightfully common 
about 1793-94. The utterly unanticipated 
character of the purchase of Louisiana is ob- 
scured by an exaggerated statement of an 
alleged American determination about 1800-2 
to oust Spain and France completely from the 
Mississippi Valley. Throughout the discus- 
sion of the Louisiana annexation there is, if 
not too much praise for Hamilton's enthusiastic 
defiance of European powers, at least a very 
stinted recognition of the fact that, after all, 
events proved Jefferson's policy of " palliation

and endurance " unquestionably the wisest that 
could have been pursued under existing con- 
ditions. The treaty by which Florida was 
purchased from Spain was signed in 1819, 
not 1818. It is mere waste of space to set 
down the Louisiana Purchase as in any degree 
a basis of American claim to Oregon. The 
Marcus Whitman legend still lives, though in 
a rather emasculated condition, in this book. 
Though the author does not go so far as to 
attribute to Whitman any actual influence in 
" saving Oregon," yet he represents Whitman's 
famous trip to the East in the winter of 
1842-43 as made for that purpose absolutely. 
In view of Professor Bourne's convincing 
argument that Whitman's mission was entirely 
for religious, not political, purposes, there can 
no longer be excuse for such blunt adherence 
to the old view, with not the slightest mention 
of the new. 

The most satisfactory portions of the book 
are the chapters on the Mexican and Oregon 
acquisitions, "Our Afctic Province — Alaska," 
" Mid-Sea Possessions," and " The Spanish 
Islands." There are perhaps no better brief, 
non-technical treatises on these topics in print. 
Despite the avowed popular character of the 
book, it is a matter for regret that there are 
no citations of sources and authorities. The 
author clearly believes the expansion which 
has thus far marked the career of the United 
States to have been quite inevitable. To him 
the annexation of the Philippines did not mark 
any new departure in American policy — did 
not even make America for the first time a 
" world power." The thesis is ardently main- 
tained, and with a good deal of success, that 
" from the very beginning America has been 
a world power and a participant in world poli- 
tics." The only region, however, in which 
further territorial acquisition may be expected 
is the West Indies. Finally the author, after 
his survey of the whole field, arrives at the 
following concisely stated conclusion : 

" Expansion has never been and never should be an 
end in itself, but merely a means of working out our 
highest national destiny. It has in the past proved such 
a means, absolutely essential and inestimably profitable. 
It would hereafter be deplorable, and deserving of 
strongest condemnation, for America to sieze upon any 
additional territory, great or small, through mere lust 
of land. It would be equally deplorable and worthy of 
condemnation for America to decline the acquisition, 
whether by peaceful purchase or by forcible conquest, 
of any territory the control of which by us was dictated 
by humanity or honor, or the possession of which was 
essential to our own safety, peace, and prosperity."

Briefs on New Books. 



That mind is something more than 
ZpZlled mind. » product of material evolution has 

never been more convincingly brought 
home to the thoughtful observer than by the lives 
of Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller. How the 
latter was led oat of darkness into light has recently 
been told us. To this account is now added an 
equally interesting and instructive narrative, illus- 
trated by copious extracts from her joarnal and 
letters, of Laura Bridgman's remarkable history. 
In some respects, this is the more noteworthy vol- 
ume of the two ; for hers was the earliest case of 
its kind successfully treated, and we are made to 
follow, almost with bated breath, the first groping 
and tentative efforts of teacher and pupil to break 
through the thick wall of darkness which the skep- 
tical public believed to be impenetrable. The book 
— its title in full is " Laura Bridgman, Dr. Howe's 
Famous Pupil, and What he Taught her" — is 
written by two of the philanthropist's daughters, 
Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott and Mrs. Florence Howe 
Hall, is illustrated (sparingly) by a son-in-law, Mr. 
John Elliott, and is published in attractive form by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. It is a filial tribute 
to Dr. Howe, as well as an account of his remark- 
able pupil. More impressive even than the won- 
derful unfolding of the afflicted girl's mind is the 
free and natural development of her fine moral 
sense, — until sectarian influences, despite Dr. 
Howe's watchful care, were brought to bear on her 
during a vacation at her home in New Hampshire. 
The worst effects of these largely wore off with 
time ; but one perceives here a sad interruption to 
the spontaneous and harmonious growth of her 
religious nature. The student of language will find 
in this volume much that is both amusing and in- 
structive, as well as pathetic, in poor Laura's heroic 
struggle to express herself in writing. 

Professor Brander Matthews has col- 
Thahutoryof lected into a volume, which is pub- 

dramatxe art. ,.,,, , tr i~.-i 

hshed by the Messrs. bcribner, a 
course of ten lectures on " The Development of the 
Drama," which he has given during the past two 
or three years before various audiences in England 
and the United States. It is not a very stout book, 
but it sketches the history of dramatic art in its 
great epochs both ancient and modern, and tells a 
story that has not heretofore been told, as far as we 
are aware, within the limits of a single volume. 
Other and more extensive histories of dramatic 
literature there are, no doubt, but as Mr. Matthews 
points out, they are " unduly distended " by bio- 
graphical and controversial matter, and fail to give 
adequate attention to the shaping influences of cir- 
cumstances and intellectual environment upon the 
development of dramatic art. Summarized, this 
interesting volume gives us a preliminary chapter 
upon " The Art of the Dramatist," two chapters on 
the Greek and Roman drama, one on the drama

of the Middle Ages, three upon the blossoming of 
the art in Spain, England, and France, respectively, 
one each upon the stage of the eighteenth and the 
nineteenth century, and a final forecast of " The 
Future of the Drama." Throughout, the material 
is judiciously selected, and the treatment is fresh 
and suggestive. The author is mainly concerned 
with the technical aspects of dramatic art, and 
brings to bear upon his treatment an extensive 
knowledge of stagecraft, based upon a thorough 
historical study of the theatre, ancient and modern. 
Those who think primarily of the drama as a spe- 
cies of literature will wince more than once at the 
author's remarks about the great poets, but the 
criticisms which he makes of their work, although 
sometimes startling, may fairly be allowed if we 
remember that an exposition of dramatic technique 
rather than of literary expression is the main pur- 
pose which he has in view. By way of illustration 
of both the author's style and the comprehensive- 
ness of his survey, we will close this notice of an 
extremely interesting book with a passage from the 
closing chapter. 

"Thus it 18 that Ibsen stretches back across the centuries 
to clasp hands with Sophocles ; and a comparison of the sus- 
taining skeleton of the story in ' Oedipus the King ' with that 
in ' Ghosts ' will bring out the fundamental likeness of the 
Scandinavian dramatist to the Greek, — at least in so far as 
the building of their plots is concerned. Inspired in the one 
case by the idea of fate and in the other by the doctrine of 
heredity, each of them worked out a theme of overwhelming 
import and of weighty simplicity. Each of them in his drama 
dealt not so much with action in the present before the eyes 
of the spectator, as with the appalling and inexorable con- 
sequences of action in the past before the play began. In 
both dramas these deeds done long ago are not set forth in a 
brief exposition more or less ingeniously included in the ear- 
lier scenes : they are slowly revealed one by one in the course 
of the play, and each at the moment when the revelation is 
most harrowing." 

The truth of this comparison is unassailable, how- 
ever it may be scoffed at by the classicist, who is 
scandalized at the very idea of naming the two 
poets in the same breath. 

The Shakespeare Jwo interesting and somewhat sim- 
eountry described ilar Contributions to Shakespeariana 
andiuuxraied. jj^^g recently made an almost sim- 
ultaneuus appearance. " The Shakespeare Coun- 
try " — first issued in the " Country Life Library " 
and now reprinted and imported by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons — is notable chiefly for its pic- 
tures ; though the text, by Mr. John Ley land, is 
far from being without intrinsic value. Mr. Ley- 
land is wise enough not to attempt to theorize about 
the incidents of Shakespeare's life ; instead, he 
expends his efforts upon a reconstruction of Eliza- 
bethan Warwickshire, where without doubt — if 
we except the Baconian theory — Shakespeare 
spent much of his life. He puts a fresh and really 
impressive emphasis on the fact that, while we know 
not what manner of man Shakespeare was, nor how 
he brewed his magic potion out of hillside beauty, 
churchyard horror, and village revel, we can know 
with very accurate approximation his physical en- 



vironment, and so can get a background with which 
to surround, though not after modern methods to 
" explain," his very lonely personality. The illus- 
trations of this volume consist of over a hundred 
remarkably clear and beautiful half-tone plates, 
made from photographs. These picture all the 
interesting landmarks of Stratford and Shottery, 
and give glimpses of the neighboring villages, of 
Warwick, Kenilworth, and Stoneleigh Abbey. — Less 
popular in method and much wider in scope than 
the foregoing is the work entitled " Shakespeare's 
Home-Land " (Dent-Dutton). Its author, Mr. W. 
Salt Brassington, is an enthusiastic antiquarian, 
who cares little for mere landscape, but revels in 
tradition, legend, and genealogical lore. He at- 
tempts, however, to record accurately and pains- 
takingly his impressions of the country around 
Stratford ; and in this part of his work he is greatly 
aided by the dainty little pen-and-ink sketches which 
are thickly scattered through his pages. But he is 
most interesting, because most interested, when he 
is delving deep into the perplexing question of 
Shakespeare's ancestry or his possible connection 
with the Gunpowder Plot, collecting all the local 
traditions of the poet, giving an exhaustive account 
of the relics and portraits of him, and finally rang- 
ing far afield to gather all the historic and legendary 
associations of places within easy distance of Strat- 
ford, whether or not they have any connection with 
Shakespeare. To the stay-at-home reader, a perusal 
of the book may prove burdensome because of the 
wealth of material included ; but the pilgrim to the 
region around Stratford will find it a valuable 
companion for a leisurely jaunt through Warwick- 
shire and parts of the neighboring counties. 

" Watts was born with a delicate con- 
'o*rw^uJ!r.a. stJtution, and all his life has been far 

from robust ; indeed, often weak and 
sickly. ... It has often been noticed that strong 
men have one weak point, and their general con- 
stitution is not stronger than that one point." 
When Mr. Hugh Macmillan wrote these words in 
comment upon his friend George Frederick Watts, 
he little imagined that the work of revising the 
proofs of the book would devolve upon the subject 
of his study. As the title, " The Life- Work of 
George Frederick Watts," suggests, Mr. Macmillan 
has devoted himself to the explanation of Mr. 
Watts's pictures and methods of work rather than 
to what might be called a biography in the strict 
sense of the word. At the same time the several 
extracts from letters, and the scraps of conversa- 
tion, so skilfully used, tell of the close relation 
between writer and subject. Of Mr. Watts's por- 
traits, which were his first serious woiks in art, 
Mr. Macmillan says: "They do not depict the 
expression which happens at the moment to come 
into the face, but the inner mystery of the person- 
ality ; not the accidencies of life, but the essentials. 
. . . We have had no such perception of character — 
no such power to paint the mind as well as the body

in portraiture, since Vandyke painted Charles I., 
Henrietta Maria, Strafford, Laud, or the Countess 
of Carlyle." From portrait-painting the artist 
passed to the broader field of imagination, to repre- 
senting the Greek myths and Hebrew stories in 
pictures; and then to what he considered his par- 
ticular sphere — Allegory. The didactic purpose 
of these pictures greatly impressed Mr. Macmillan; 
and the explanations of the allegories, the fitting 
out of Mr. Watts's suggestions by the author, pro- 
vide many points of interest. Yet we sometimes 
wish Mr. Macmillan had not admired his subject 
quite so ardently. Not that the subject is unde- 
serving of his praise, but the frequent reiteration 
of the artist's peculiar fitness for every department 
of his art is likely to pall upon us. The book is 
filled with many poetic and literary reminiscences, 
oftentimes merely quotations, but more frequently 
inwrought in the author's sentences. The accurate 
and comprehensive index renders the book valuable 
as a work of reference, not alone to Mr. Watts's 
work, but to contemporary art as well. 

Near the summit of Echo Mountain, 
Ech^MMin. overlooking the beautiful city of 

Pasadena, in the fertile San Gabriel 
Valley of California, is situated the Lowe Obser- 
vatory, the director of which, Mr. E. L. Larkin, 
entranced by the beauties of the scenes around him 
and by those of the overhanging vault of heaven, 
has written a little book in which he portrays the 
glories which flash from sun and star, and indicates 
the results which astronomers have won with the 
spectroscope and photographic plate. The title of 
the book, " Radiant Energy " (Los Angeles : Baum- 
gardt Publishing Co.), is doubly happy ; for it sug- 
gests not only the flashings of power from distant 
worlds, but also the exuberant spirit of the author. 
For him, '' The Galactic hosts are splashed and 
strewn in spray, in spirals, and are tumbled in con- 
fusion on a carpet of jet-black velvet, or cosmical 
hail of pearls and diamonds on blackened wastes of 
space, or piled in heaps, raked into windrows and 
rolled into banks and bulwarks, all flashing and 
blazing with supernal colors." To him, spectrum 
analysis is the " chief study that ever actuated the 
human brain "; and of the dark lines in the solar 
spectrum, he says, " Their discovery and translation 
is the chief event that has occurred on the earth 
within the period of written history." Of the men 
who make astrophysical investigations, we are told 
that " no labor ever performed by the human frame 
is more arduous and exacting than that hourly 
engaged in by a working astrophysicist. A trained 
astronomer is a machine of precision, with every 
phase of bodily life, every faculty of mind, every- 
thing in his being, an abject slave to indomitable 
will." Even the apparently insignificant decimal 
.00002010899 may produce in us a feeling of awe, 
when we are informed that it has " tremendous 
analytical power, and there is no escape from its 
clutch for any mass, if it is moving." The reader 



bows humbly before the parallax of Alpha Centauri, 
when he becomes aware that it is " that number 
whose value cannot be compared to anything in the 
possession of man." But the reader must go to the 
book itself to enjoy to the full the freshness and 
uncoDventionality of the author. After reading 
the last twenty-five pages, in which are described 
the beautiful location of the Lowe Observatory 
and the wonderful appearance of the starry vault 
above it, one may be pardoned for taking the next 
train to Southern California, in acceptance of Mr. 
Larkin's invitation found on p. 317, which runs as 
follows : " So, to geologists, biologists, entomologists, 
botanists, mineralogists, microscopists, meteorolo- 
gists, naturalists, lovers of nature in her most splen- 
did forms and modes, students of the sea, growers 
of fruit, engineers, electricians, railroad builders, 
mountain climbers, explorers, spectroscopists, pho- 
tographers, artists, and astronomers, it is said, come 
to this wondrous place — Echo Mountain." 

The autobiographical record of the 
o/lnA^itrZT^! formative influences in a notable life 

is always instructive; and such a 
record gains in interest when it is made to include, 
besides an account of the author's own work, nu- 
merous anecdotes and pen-sketches of great men 
with whom it was his good fortune to be asso- 
ciated. The earlier chapters of Professor New- 
comb's "Reminiscences" (Houghton) deal with the 
boyish yearnings of the author for something more 
than a mere living, and with his successful efforts 
to escape from the " world of cold and darkness " 
into the regions of " sweetness and light." Pro- 
fessor Newcomb writes of his early life in Nova 
Scotia, of his attempts to teach school in Maryland, 
and of the years he spent in fitting himself for 
his great work in astronomy, with simple candor 
and directness. More interesting still are the 
chapters dealing with the life-work of the author, 
connecting him with the great movements of astro- 
nomical thought and scientific progress during the 
past forty or fifty years. One great value of the 
book lies in its collection of sketches of scientific 
men. The author writes of personal contact with 
such men as Leverrier and Adams, the twin dis- 
coverers of Neptune, of Airy the Astronomer Royal, 
of Hansen, Holden, Barnard, Tyndall, Henry, Hill, 
Lord Kelvin, Struve, and many others. Some of 
the author's feats of observation read like the detec- 
tive stories of Conan Doyle. His method of clear- 
ing Father Hell of suspected forgery was worthy 
of the celebrated Sherlock Holmes himself. He is 
never wearisome, — and whether he tells us of his 
life in Paris at the time of the capitulation to the 
Prussians, or of the humorous antics of a Washing- 
ton newsboy during our Civil War, his words are 
full of that human sympathy which is a character- 
istic of the man. The book is readable throughout ; 
indeed, it is preeminently one of those of which 
it can truthfully be said that " there is not a dull 
page in it."

Lectures ami To those who demand of a book 

addresses of that it shall be something more than 

a journalist. ^gj.g literature, " The Compromises 

of Life " (Fox, Duffield & Co.), by the editor of the 
Louisville " Courier-Journal," will give satisfaction. 
Written by a man of wide experience outside his 
chosen field of journalism, this collection of public 
addresses is a pleasing change from the lucubrations 
of the closet philosopher. Mr. Watterson is honest, 
outspoken, abundantly endowed with what is known 
as horse sense, always sanely optimistic, and never- 
failing in wit and humor. In his own way, and 
choosing his own illustrations, he preaches the gos- 
pel that the life is more than meat, and the body 
than raiment. That a public speaker should never 
contradict himself, is too much to expect ; and 
80 we find Mr. Watterson not entirely free from 
an Emersonian disregard of consistency. In the 
title-chapter of his book he deprecates the horrors 
of armed conflict, and declares, '' I would compro- 
mise war," adding that the occasions on which it is 
necessary are " most exceptional." Yet in a speech 
delivered only two years after the utterance of these 
words he does not hesitate to say, in reference to 
international arbitration, that the '' elimination [of 
war] makes the emasculation of the human species 
simply a question of time "; and again, in his ad- 
dress on Lincoln, alluding to the latter's attempts 
to avert civil strife, he rejoices that the war " was 
fought out to its bitter and logical conclusion." 
The best and most authoritative chapters in the 
book are those dealing with conditions in the South 
and with journalism. 

Denmark, once the sovereign coun- 
I/'hl'otJii' *^y <»* England, of Norway, and of 

Sweden, as well as of large portions 
of Germany and Russia (even Paris was once, in the 
ninth century, conquered by the Danes), is now the 
smallest of European kingdoms; but she is by no 
means the least important, — certainly not the least 
interesting. Specialists from almost all countries 
make it their business to study Danish institutions, 
with the result that these institutions are often 
copied elsewhere. Denmark has set the world an 
example in the adoption of a perfect cooperative 
system in connection with agriculture. In the re- 
clamation of barren lands for the formation of plan- 
tations of vast extent, she has shown other countries 
what things may be done, and how. Her breweries 
are models, her schools and hospitals are admirable. 
She has been conservative of her national customs 
in a manner quite at variance with the more push- 
ing and rushing nations and with young republics. 
The Dane is in no hurry. He does not come of age 
until he is twenty-five, nor attain to the parliament- 
ary suffrage until five years later. He takes time 
to do things thoroughly, and lives to a good old age. 
Denmark therefore offers an extremely interesting 
subject for a volume of the " European Neighbours " 
series (Putnam), and Miss Jessie Brochner treats it 
in her volume on " Danish Life in Town and Coun- 



try " with a thoroughness and sympathy that leave 
nothing to be desired. It may be that the town-life 
as exhibited in Copenhagen, the capital, is more 
fully treated than the country ; but the reader would 
be captious indeed who would find this a fault in 
the book. The half-tone illustrations, sixteen in 
number (three of them from paintings by Danish 
artists), prove that Denmark and Danish life are 
by no means deficient in the picturesque element.

government, took up newspaper cor- 
respondence in addition to his regular duties as 
attacks, and during the years 1864-69 furnished 
countless columns of French gossip to the " Morn- 
ing Star " and the " Yorkshire Post." About one- 
twelfth of this, harvest of an observant eye and 
a listening ear has been culled out by Mr. A. R. 
Waller for republication in a stout octavo entitled 
" Gossip from Paris during the Second Empire " 
(Appleton). The correspondent shows himself a 
wide-awake young man, ready to take an interest 
in anything that has a promise of " copy," and 
putting his matter into attractive shape for English 
readers. The very first letter of the volume has a 
humorous account of a retired grocer who chose to 
end his days as a Norman baron, building himself 
an ancient castle, with moat and keep and dungeon 
dark, and, with the sexton's aid, providing his es- 
tablishment with a graveyard skeleton for suspen- 
sion in chains over the tower-flanked entrance ta 
his frowning fortress. Turning a few leaves, we 
come to an instructive note on the fertilizing prop- 
erties of rags, which, we are assured, make an 
excellent dressing for siliceous soil. Some of the 
items partake of the grim and ghastly, others ap- 
peal to lovers of the frivolous or of the sensational,, 
but many are of literary or historical interest. A 
long extract is given from General Dix's speech 
to the American colony on his relinquishing his 
post as United States minister to France. Taken 
as a whole, the book will be found to have some- 
thing likely to interest all sorts and conditions of 

readers. 

The long period of religious conflict 
Itli'ojFTancl t^at began with the Protestant Ref- 
ormation and closed with the Thirty 
Years' War will always be of great interest to all 
readers of history. Especially does it appeal to that 
class of students who delight in tracing the influence 
of human passion on the course of great events. 
Among the more recent books dealing with this 
century is a volume by Lieut.-Colonel Andrew C. P. 
Haggard, entitled "Sidelights on the Court of 
France " (Button). This work belongs to the bor- 
derland of history and biography; though the au- 
thor discusses such eminently historic subjects as the 
League, the fate of Mary Stuart, and the policies 
of Richelieu, his principal theme is the public and 
private life of Henry of Navarre. It cannot be said 
that his presentation is such that it adds much to

oar general knowledge of that sinful period ; that 
the Bourbon court was not a place where morality 
was likely to thrive, is a fact too well known to 
need the additional emphasis given by a detailed 
account of weakness and wickedness like the one 
here presented. As for the author's treatment of 
Henry IV., it must be said that the unlovely side 
of his character is given undue prominence, and too 
little is said of the really great things that he did 
for France. The author's sources are apparently 
of the memoir type, and French memoirs are noto- 
riously untrustworthy. The book is written in an 
easy, spicy, and somewhat careless style, such as we 
should expect to find in a work so largely devoted 
to scandal and intrigue.

read the latest (and, it is to be hoped, 
the final) plea in the unedifying controversy between 
the Froudites and the Carlylists. " The Nemesis of 
Froude" (Lane), by Sir James Crichton Browne 
and Mr. Alexander Carlyle, is an elaborate and con- 
vincing refutation of the flimsy charges contained 
in Froude's posthumous pamphlet, ''My Relations 
with Carlyle," recently published by members of 
bis family. A rejoinder was hardly necessary, as 
the writer of the pamphlet already stands convicted 
out of his own mouth, his self-contradictions de- 
stroying his credibility. It is the old story of forg- 
ing new falsehoods — or, which amounts to the 
same thing, new half-truths — to buttress the tot- 
tering structure of the old, only to make more sig- 
nal the final ruin. Pathetic, in view of what was 
to follow, are Carlyle's words to Miss Jewsbury, 
relating to a "mythical" portraiture of Mrs. Carlyle 
which she had submitted to his inspection, and which, 
although he expressly commanded its suppression as 
a distortion of the truth, Froude took pains to pub- 
lish in full. " No need," writes the sorrowing hus- 
band, " that an idle-gazing world should know my 
lost Darling's History, or mine ; — nor wUl they 
ever ; — they may depend upon it ! One fit service, 
and one only, they can do to Her or to Me : cease 
speaking of us through all eternity, as soon as they 
conveniently can." Late in the day though it be, 
let us take heed and obey. 

" The Public," a weekly paper pub- 
Vigorou, essay, y^^Yx^di j^ Chicago, has attracted the 

on vital toptct. . , , , , , i ■ 

attention of thoughtful men during 

the past four or five years by its exceptionally 
clear and vigorous discussion of public affairs. It 
has been particularly effective as a mouthpiece of 
those who are opposed to the bastard imperialism 
which has written into our national annals their 
most shameful chapters. No more effective pro- 
test against this ominous tendency of our public 
policy has been made than that which has been 
voiced in " The Public " from week to week by 
Mr. Louis F. Post, the editor of the periodical. 
Mr. Post has now collected his scattered papers 



upon this and other subjects of national concern 
into a volume called " Ethics of Democracy," fur- 
ther described as " a series of optimistic essays on 
the natural laws of human society," and issued by 
the Moody Publishing Co. Mr. Post is a strong 
and fearless thinker, with a remarkable gift of ex- 
position, and the radical system of Democratic 
ethics which he outlines is fairly self-consistent. 
In many respects it will command the hearty ap- 
proval of all honest thinkers, although to our mind 
it is vitiated by its acceptance of the single-tax idea 
with its sundry implications. "We do not object to 
the single tax as a theory so much as we object to 
the fashion in which Mr. Post and its other advo- 
cates override the most elementary considerations 
of justice in their propaganda for the institution of 
their pet reform. They have adopted toward the 
private holding of land the fanatical position of 
the extreme abolitionists toward the holding of 
human beings in slavery, and will not allow that 
the present owner of real property has any rights 
that need be considered in the economic readjust- 
ment which they aim to bring about. From this 
position to the advocacy of a lawless termination 
of such contracts as public franchises and even to 
the repudiation of public debts is an easy step, and 
one that the author does not hesitate to take. 
" Repudiation is a sacred right of the people " are 
his own words. We regret that this perverse polit- 
ical morality should be found underlying a book 
with which we are in many ways heartily in sym- 
pathy, which is so entirely right in its denunciation 
of imperialism, and which is so exceptionally sound 
and clear in its view of such matters as free trade 
and international balances. 

In M. Eugene Bohm-Bawerk's lat- 
Recenttheoriet ggj hook, " Recent Literature on In- 
terest " (translated by Mr. Wm. A. 
Scott and published by the Macmillan Co.), he has 
supplemented his " Capital and Interest " by giving 
a critical summary of the interest theories advanced 
from 1884 to 1889. The author has evidently at- 
tempted a criticism of the salient points in various 
men's arguments on this subject, rather than a 
lengthy exposition of the arguments themselves. 
Therefore the book presupposes a certain amount of 
intimacy with modern writers on interest; and for 
this reason it appeals primarily, if not exclusively, 
to the student of economics. M. Bohm-Bawerk 
keenly points out the fallacies in the use, the absti- 
nence, the labor, the productivity, and the exploita- 
tion theories of interest, and shows the weak position 
of the eclectics. His method of attack is to follow 
the premises of the various writers to their logical 
conclusion, — a reductio ad absurdum. Especially 
skilful are his treatments of Marshall's abstinence 
theory and Stolzmann's labor-cost theory. M. 
Bohm-Bawerk, as an advocate of the agio theory, 
draws the conclusion that " nowadays it may be 
considered as a recognized truth that the final causes 
of the phenomenon of interest are to be found, on

The tourist seeking facts concerning 
^if*^Ui *^® points of interest to be visited on 

a trip to the Pacific coast will find a 
deal of information in Mr. C A. Higgins's and Mr. 
Charles A. Keeler's volume "To California and 
Back " (Doubleday, Page & Co.). This book de- 
scribes the trip through New Mexico and Arizona 
by way of the Grand Cafion of the Colorado. The 
pueblos of the Southwest and the missions of Cali- 
fornia naturally receive full notice, and are abun- 
dantly illustrated. The wonders which irrigation 
has wrought in the deserts of Southern California 
are brought to the reader's notice, and the less 
exploited but no less interesting country of Central 
and Northern California is portrayed in attractive 
guise. Indeed, few ports on any continent present 
the variety of interests which now centre about the 
Bay of San Francisco, where the mountains meet 
the sea and the Orient jostles the Occident. The 
book is abundantly illustrated from new photo- 
graphs, and by sketches from the pens of Miss Louise 
M. Keeler and Mr. McCutcheon. The reminiscence 
of the railroad " folder " which clings to the book 
does not mar its interest or detract from its trust- 
worthiness. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Volumes Thirteen and Fourteen of Messrs. J. F. 
Taylor & Co.'s library edition of the writings of Charles 
Kingsley contain the letters and memoirs of his life, 
as edited by his widow, with an introduction by Mr. 
Maurice Kingsley, his oldest son. We are glad to have 
this satisfactory uniform edition of all of Kingsley's 
works that still find numbers of readers. His ser- 
mons, which fill many more volumes, and which are 
excellent of their kind, have gone the way of most 
sermons, and are not now likely to be reprinted. This 
edition does not contain any of them, nor does it include 
the historical lectures and miscellaneous essays, which 
is something of a pity, for they deserve to be remem- 
bered. 

Messrs. A. N. Marquis & Co. have sent us their third 
issue of " Who 's Who in America," revised to the 
present year, and including 14,443 names instead of the 
11,551 and 8602 of the two earlier issues. As hereto- 
fore this work is under the skilful and competent editor- 
ship of Mr. John W. Leonard. Owing to the large 
number of deaths among those included in the previous 
editions (1108 in all), it is possible to state that more 
than half of the names in the present list were not in the 
first edition as published in 1899. The necrology alone 
makes a list of nearly thirty closely-printed pages. We 
have now a somewhat larger representation than for- 
merly of the financial and commercial callings, which 
gives a better balance to the work. Club memberships 
are now included in the information furnished. The 
educational, marriage, and age statistics compiled by 
the editor are of great interest. One man (who is not 
named, and whom we have not hunted down) was born 
in 1809 — the annus mirabilis of Tennyson, Gladstone, 



Lincoln, and Darwin — and is thus the oldest of Amer- 
ican " who-whos." The year which gave birth to the 
largest number is 1858, which claims 417 men and 
women, of whom President Roosevelt is one. The work 
in its present form is more valuable than ever, and we 
could not commend in terms too high the accuracy and 
the judgment displayed in the work of compilation. 

Nine new volumes have been added by the Messrs. 
Appleton to their series of reprints of famous old En- 
glish books, most of them noteworthy because of their 
illustrations, which are carefully reproduced. The 
volumes are as follows : " The Second Tour of Dr. 
Syntax," illustrated in color by Rowlandson ; " The 
English Dance of Death," in two volumes, also with 
Rowlandson's colored plates; "The Life of a Sports- 
man " and " The Analysis of the Hunting Field," both 
with colored illustrations by Henry Aiken; Ainsworth's 
" Tower of London " and " Windsor Castle," with 
drawings by Cruikshank ; «• The Fables of -3i8op 
and Others," with Bewick's engravings; and William 
Blake's " Illustrations of the Book of Job " — a thin 
volume of plates only, in miniature photogravure re- 
production. 

Volumes XII., XIII., and XIV. of "The New 
International Encyclopoedia," published by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co., have recently come to our table, 
and the end of the work is now brought within three 
volumes. Maximilian is the first entry in the volumes 
now at hand, and Rice- Bird is the last. The policy of 
rich illustration is still pursued in these new issues, 
and the full-page plates and maps, both plain and 
colored, are a source of great satisfaction, tempting us 
to turn the pages for the sake of the pictures alone. 
This is not said in disparagement of the text, which 
maintains, and perhaps improves upon, its earlier stan- 
dards of readableness and accuracy. 

The Dramatic Publishing Co. of Chicago send us a 
volume of " Modern Monologues " by Miss Marjorie 
Benton Cooke. The author is a young woman well 
known in Chicago as a talented amateur actress, and 
as the impersonator of the characters figured in this 
bright and entertaining volume. The success of the 
pieces, as presented by the author herself upon many 
semi-public occasions, has provided a very practical test 
of their effectiveness. Still another volume of " Mono- 
logues," the work of Miss May Isabel Fisk, is published 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. Many of these com- 
positions have previously appeared in " Harper's Maga- 
zine," and they certainly afford amusing reading. 
Gentle satire upon the foibles of society and of indi- 
viduals is the note of both these charming books. 

The following French texts are from the American 
Book Co. : " An Easy First French Reader," by Mr. 
L. C. Syms; " Fifty Fables by La Fontaine," edited by 
Mr. Kenneth McKenzie; Mdrimde's " Colomba," edited 
by Mr. Hiram Parker Williamson; and Chateaubriand's 
" Les Aventures du Dernier Abencerage," edited by 
Dr. James D. Bruner. From Messrs. Ginn & Co. we 
have '« A French Reader," by Messrs. Fred Davis 
Aldrich and Irving Lysander Foster; and George 
Sand's •' La Mare au Diable," edited by Dr. Leigh R. 
Gregor. The American Book Co. also send us two 
important Spanish texts: " A Practical Course in Span- 
ish," by Messrs. H. M. Monsanto and Louis A. Lan- 
guellier, revised by Professor Freeman M. Josselyn, Jr. ; 
and the " Dona Perfecta " of Senor B. Perez Galdds, 
edited by Professor Edwin Seelye Lewis,

authority upon the poet, is published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press. 

It is announced that Mr. Samuel M. Crothers, author 
of " The Gentle Reader," is preparing the volume on 
Lowell for the «« American Men of Letters " series, 
published by Messrs. Houghton, Miffiin & Co. 

A handsome edition of «' The High History of the 
Holy Grail," in the translation of Dr. Sebastian Evans, 
with decorative drawings by Miss Jessie M. King, is a 
recent publication of Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

A volume of more than usual interest to lovers of 
our native literature is that promised by Mr. Leon H. 
Vincent on "American Literary Masters," which Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. are to publish this spring. 

" The Four Socratic Dialogues of Plato," in Jowett's 
translation, with a preface by the present Master of 
Balliol, make a very attractive little book as published 
by Mr. Henry Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press. 
Mr. W. P. P. Longfellow's " Cyclopcedia of Works of 
Architecture in Italy, Greece, and the Levant," has just 
been sent us in a new edition, not evidently differing 
from the original, by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

"The Controversy between the Puritans and the 
Stage," by Dr. Elbert N. S. Thompson, is a recent issue 
of the "Yale Studies in English." The work is a 
doctoral thesis, and makes a substantial volume of 275 
pages. 

Mr. John Lane publishes a reissue of White's 
« Selborne," as edited several years ago by the late 
Grant Allen. In its present form, the work stands as 
the first volume of a new " Crown Library " of reprints 
of popular books. 

" Money, Banking, and Finance," by Dr. Albert S. 
BoUes, is a text-book for high schools having commer- 
cial courses. It is published by the American Book 
Co., in uniform style with the " Political Economy " of 
Professor Laughlin. 



" An Unpublished Essay of Edwards on the Trinity,"^ 
with some remarks on the teachings of the great theo- 
logian, is the contribution of Dr. George P. Fisher to 
the Edwards bicentenary. The book is published by 
the Messrs. Scribner. 

One of the most important works on Economics that 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have ever undertaken is 
" An Introduction to Economics," by Professor Henry 
R. Seager, of Columbia, which they expect to issue be- 
fore the end of this month. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. send us a fourth 
edition of the " Handbook of Commercial Geography " 
by Mr. George G. Chisholm, first published nearly 
fifteen years ago. The work now makes a volume of 
over six hundred closely-printed pages. 

"A Primer of Old Testament History," by the 
Rev. O. R. Barnicott, and " The Religions of India — 
Brahmanism and Buddhism," by the Rev. Allan Menzies, 
are two new volumes in the " Temple " series of Bible 
handbooks, published by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

" Bridge " is coming to have a considerable literature 
of its own. The latest books are " The Laws and Prin- 
ciples of Bridge," by " Badsworth," published by the 
Messrs. Putnam; and "Sixty Bridge Hands," by Mr. 
Charles Stuart Street, published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. 

" The Colonel's Opera Cloak " was one of the most 
popular novels published in the " No Name " series of 
a quarter- century ago. It was afterwards revealed that 
Miss Christine C. Brush was the author. A new illus- 
trated edition of this book is now issued by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. 

Mr. Leonard Eckstein Opdycke's translation of 
Castiglione's " Book of the Courtier," published in a 
sumptuous limited edition a year or more ago, now 
reappears in a garb relatively more modest, yet still 
stately and worthy of the dignity of the text. The 
Messrs. Scribner are the publishers. 

"The Founder of Christendom," an essay by Pro- 
fessor Goldwin Smith, is published in a small volume 
by the American Unitarian Association. Primarily an 
address prepared for a Toronto audience, the discussion 
is at once so reasonable and so weighty that it was richly 
deserving of its present permanent form. 

With its current number, the quarterly " Book of 
Book-Plates " makes a change of title to " Books and 
Book-Plates," with a corresponding enlargement of 
scope and contents. The A. Wessels Co. are the Amer- 
ican publishers of this little periodical, which is both 
sensible in matter and attractive in form. 

Dr. Gordon Jennings Laing has edited a volume of 
" Masterpieces of Latin Literature," which is published 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The selections 
given illustrate seventeen authors, from Terence to 
Apuleius, and the translators are much more numerous, 
Catullus alone being represented by ten different hands. 
Each author is given a biographical sketch of two or 
three pages. 

" New England History in Ballads " is a volume of 
poems by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, his children, and 
some other people. These " other people " include 
several of our most famous poets, the aim of Dr. Hale 
having been to take the best existing poems in his field, 
and to piece them out with new ones made for the 
purpose, so as to cover everything of importance in 
New England history. Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 
publish this interesting collection.

Mr. Bliss Carman has just issued his Christmas poem 
entitled " The Word at St. Kavin's," privately printed 
at the Monadnock Press in New Hampshire, with an 
especially designed frontispiece and title-page by Mr. 
John M. Cleland. The edition is limited to 250 copies, 
to be obtained only through the Scott-Thaw Co. of 
New York. 

One of the interesting biographies promised for 1904 
is the Life of John A. Andrew, the war-governor of 
Massachusetts, to be brought out by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. The work is based upon both public and 
private records, the author, Mr. Henry G. Pearson, 
having had access not only to the abundant documents 
and letters in the State House, but also to private and 
family memorials. 

" Marriage in Epigram," compiled by Mr. Frederick 
W. Morton, is a recent publication of Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. It is described as a collection of 
" stings, flings, facts, and fancies from the thought of 
ages," which seems to be both accurate and pleasantly 
alliterative. We miss from the index the name of 
Schopenhauer, who might surely have been drawn upon 
to spice, if not exactly to enrich, this collection. 

This spring Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. are to 
have volumes of fiction from the following authors : 
Lafcadio Hearn, Baroness von Hutten, Hildegarde 
Hawthorne, Andy Adams, Charles Egbert Craddock, 
Rose E. Young, Frederick O. Bartlett, and Margaret 
D. Jackson. They will also publish new books by Rollo 
Ogden, George B. McClellan, Henry D. Sedgwick, 
Washington Gladden, N. S. Shaler, W. Starling Bur- 
gess, and Olive Thorne Miller. 

«< The United States in Our Own Time," by Chan- 
cellor E. Benjamin Andrews, is the title given to a new 
edition of " The History of the Last Quarter Century," 
to which, however, several new chapters have been added, 
making the record cover something like thirty-five years 
of our annals. " From Reconstruction to Expansion " 
is the sub-title, which serves fairly well as a delimitation 
of the ground covered. Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
are, as before, the publishers of the work. 

Among the important announcements of spring pub- 
lications from Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. are 
the following : " A Bachelor in Arcady," an idyllic 
romance by Mr. Halliwell Sutcliffe; " The Life of Dean 
Farrar," being the authorized biography of this noted 
theologian and writer, by his son Mr. Reginald Farrar; 
" Ruskin Relics," a series of important and interesting 
Ruskiniana by that author's friend and official bio- 
grapher, Mr. W. G. CoUingwood ; and " Minute Mar- 
vels of Nature," by Mr. John J. Ward, an illustrated 
work dealing for the first time in a popular way with 
the marvels of minute life which are revealed only by 
the microscope. 

The Macmillan Co. announce that they will publish 
this month the first number of a new periodical entitled 
" The Artist Engraver," a quarterly magazine of orig- 
inal work. The first number will contain an etching by 
Professor A. Legros, an engraving on copper by William 
Strang, a woodcut by Mr. C. H. Shannon, a lithograph 
by Mr. Joseph Pennell, and an etching by Mr. D. Y. 
Cameron. The Macmillan Co. have also become the 
American publishers of " The Burlington Magazine," 
which has become famous during its two and a half 
years of life for its beautiful reproductions of all sorts 
of rare objects of art, the real appreciation of which is 
confined chiefly to the connoisseur. 



An essay on " Optimism," by Miss Helen Keller, is 
made into a very pretty little book by Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. This is Miss Keller's first piece of 
original writing (with the exception of the remarkable 
autobiography published last year), and its theme is 
not the least surprising of its characteristics. If Miss 
Keller can be an optimist, there is small excuse for the 
rest of us who profess to be anything else. 

" Tennyson's Suppressed Poems, Now for the First 
Time Collected," is the title of a volume published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. Mr. J. C. Thomson is the 
editor, and he seems to have done his work thoroughly, 
but it may be doubted whether it was worth doing. 
Many of the pieces here brought together have long 
been included in the American editions of Tennyson, 
although the editor assures us that they are not found in 
his " Collected Works " as issued by his own publishers. 

There is to be a new issue of " Cassell's National 
Library," in enlarged form and attractive cloth cover 
with excellent type and paper. " Silas Marner " comes 
first, to be followed at weekly intervals by " A Senti- 
mental Journey," " Richard II.," Evelyn's Diary, selec- 
tions from Browning and Tennyson, Horace Walpole's 
Letters, Hazlitt's and Emerson's Essays, " Sartor Re- 
sartus," and Thackeray's " Four Georges." Professor 
Henry Morley's introductions were a valuable feature 
of the old issue, and many " eminent hands " will per- 
form a like duty for the new volumes. 

An undertaking of great interest to every student of 
Western history has just been announced by The Arthur 
H. Clark Co. of Cleveland. This is a series of " Early 
Western Travels," 1748-1846, comprising annotated 
reprints of some of the best and rarest contemporary 
volumes of travel, descriptive of the aborigines and 
social and economic conditions in the middle and far 
west, during the period of early American settlement. 
Exhaustive notes and introductions will be supplied by 
Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, editor of the " Jesuit Re- 
lations " and the foremost authority ^on Western history, 
who is also to supply an elaborate analytical index, 
under one alphabet, to the complete series. This latter 
is an especially valuable feature, as almost all of the 
rare originals are without indexes. There are to be 
thirty-one volumes in all, illustrated with maps, fac- 
similes, etc. The edition is limited to 750 complete 
sets, signed and numbered; but in addition thereto, a 
limited number of the volumes will be sold separately. 

In connection with the limited folio reprint of Florio's 
Montaigne, now in course of publication by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., it is interestipg to note that 
Mr. George B. Ives, its editor, has found of great as- 
sistance the Montaigne collection recently acquired by 
the Harvard library. This collection, by the way, was 
the property of the late Professor Ferdinand Bocher, 
and was purchased for the library through the gener- 
osity of Mr. James H. Hyde. It is not yet catalogued, 
but Mr. Ives was granted special permission to inspect 
it, and it proved to be of exceptional service in pre- 
paring the bibliography of the essays which is to ap- 
pear in the third and final volume of the set. The 
author states that he now has absolutely accurate de- 
scriptions of almost all of the important editions, and 
is confident that his list will include some mention of 
very nearly every French edition. So it is safe to 
assume that the bibliography will prove by no means 
the least valuable feature of this notable and imposing 
edition.

Efficient Service to Librarians 

""THE service we render to librarians and book 
committees, both in the way of information 
and the supplying of all books ordered, is most 
efficient and thorough. 

TWO REASONS 

1 Our stock is larger and more general than 
that of any other house in the United States. 

2 Our extensive experience, gained from 
constant attention to library orders, enables 
us to give much practical information and 
many suggestions to book buyers. 



The book catalogues we publish are considered 
the best and most complete issued by any com- 
mercial house — one of our catalogues includes 
over 21,000 different titles, which is only a portion 
of the books we carry regularly in our stock.

NET PRICES AND LIBRARIES. 

When the leading American publishers united, 
about two years ago, in the adoption of their 
plan for a rehabilitation of the book-selling 
business by establishing a uniform system of 
discounts, coupled with a refusal to sell to deal- 
ers who offered books for less than the prices 
fixed by the publishers, the effort was regarded 
favorably by the greater part of the thoughtful 
public, although it was not viewed altogether 
without misgivings. It was generally realized 
that the bookseller was in a bad way, and that 
the book-store of the old-fashioned type, well- 
stocked and intelligently conducted, was too 
civilizing an influence to be given up with a 
light heart, and it was felt that the combination 
attempted, although clearly " in restraint of 
trade " in the legal sense, was deserving of ap- 
proval in the larger interests of culture. As 
far as the misgivings with which the plan was 
received were legal, there was nothing to do 
but to put it into operation and to wait the 
action of the courts, concerning which point 
we may say, in passing, that the decisions 
thus far rendered leave the matter still doubt- 
ful, although with perhaps more of encour- 
agement to the publishers than they could 
fairly have anticipated. 

The other misgivings, to which we gave ex- 
pression when the subject first came up for 
debate, were based upon an apprehension that 
the publishing interests would not do their part 
in good faith. As we then pointed out, the 
publishers were bound to do two things if they 
would clear their skirts of the charge of seek- 
ing their own selfish ends under a hypocritical 
pretense of concern for the sufferings of the 
booksellers. One of these things was to publish 
all net books at prices which should be at least 
twenty per cent, below the scale previously in 
use ; the other was to raise voluntarily, and as 
a matter of course, the customary royalty to 
authors from ten to twelve and one-half per 
cent. If these things were not done, it would 
become fairly evident that self-seeking rather 
than altruism was the underlying motive in the 
cooperative plan, and the fine professions with 
which it was heralded would soon be discounted 
by the public as uniformly as the price-lists by 



72 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



the publishers, and to far more radical effect. 
Now we have been observing these matters 
rather closely for about two years, and we have 
not yet heard of that general increase of 
authors' royalties which simple justice demands, 
nor have we been convinced that prices under 
the net system are a full fifth lower than they 
would have been under the old conditions. 

This latter question is, we admit, confusing, 
and a good many publishers seem to have made 
an honest attempt to carry out their implied 
compact with the public. But the experience 
in this matter of the librarians, who have made 
a more systematic study of the subject than any 
other class of people, is not reassuring. They 
were promised in advance by figures (which 
proverbially cannot lie) that the net system of 
prices, taken in connection with the discount of 
ten per cent, to libraries, would mean for them 
an average increase of eight per cent, in their 
invoices of current publications. This they 
were willing to allow as their contribution to a 
philanthropic movement, and the plan received 
their endorsement subject to this understand- 
ing. But subsequent experience seems to have 
made of the promised eight per cent, a barren 
ideality, and we have from them reports show- 
ing advances of fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five 
per cent, instead of the lower amount they were 
ready to concede. 

The dispute came to something like a dead- 
lock at the Niagara Falls conference of the 
American Library Association last year, when 
the question was warmly debated by represen- 
tatives of both the publishing and the library 
interests, the latter demanding a larger dis- 
count, and the former declaring that it could 
not possibly be granted. Under these circum- 
stances, the only recourse left the librarians 
was to cast about for some means of reducing 
their book budgets under the ex'sting condi- 
tions, and to this end a Committee on Book 
Prices was constituted, and directed to advise 
librarians from time to time " in regard to any 
feasible measures for avoiding the hardships of 
the net price system." That committee has 
now issued the first of a series of bulletins on 
the subjf'Ct of economy in book- purchasing, and 
others will follow as new suggestions are made 
that seem worth considering. 

The leading point made in this bulletin is to 
the general effect that a good many books may 
be imported from England at a lower price 
than that at which they may be bought from 
American booksellers. It is notorious that our 
publishers who import English editions list 



them at a higher price than is justified. Tak- 
ing into account the large discount that the 
importing publisher receives, even the addition 
of the duty and the cost of transportation can- 
not excuse the listing of such books (as so fre- 
quently is done) at the rate of thirty-five cents 
to the shilling. This is at least twenty-five per 
cent too much, and every large library can 
make a substantial saving on such books by 
sending to the English publishers for them. 
Among the instances quoted by the committee 
are the new Chambers's " Cyclopasdia of En- 
glish Literature " and the Garnett and Gosse 
''Illustrated History of English Literature." 
Here the net prices to libraries are respectively, 
$13.50 as against $7.88 for the former work, 
and $22.60 as against $15.00 for the latter. 
A proportional saving may be made in many 
other cases, and this consideration clearly out- 
weighs the disadvantage of a month's delay in 
getting the books. 

As far as this remedy goes, it is one to which 
libraries will do well to resort ; unfortunately 
it is not applicable to the ordinary new Ameri- 
can book. Here the bulletin suggests not buy- 
ing the book at all, but getting instead more 
copies of standard old books, buying sets of 
periodicals, rebinding the old books, and look- 
ing out for copies of recent publications at 
auction sales and elsewhere. This is too heroic 
a treatment of the difficulty to find much 
favor with a public crazed by the desire to read 
the newest books right away, but it is in the 
main sensible advice and should be followed as 
far as public sentiment will allow. 

It seems to us that the publishers have acted 
unwisely in taking so determined a stand 
against the wishes of the libraries. They 
need all the friends they can get in their effort 
to restore the bookselling business to its earlier 
dignity and security, and the libraries are on 
the whole the best friends they can have. A 
deep-seated antagonism has now been created 
which it will not be easy to soften. We be- 
lieve that underlying the whole controversy 
there may be still found among our publishers 
the notion that libraries tend to diminish the 
sale of books. Against this narrow view we 
have always protested, and will continue to 
protest. In the long run, we believe that every 
public library creates more private purchasers 
that it destroys, and that the permanent inter- 
ests of the publishing business have much 
more to gain than to lose from the multiplica- 
tion of libraries of all sorts. To take but one 
consideration, too often lost sight of, how valu-

able an asset to the whole business of serious 
publishing must be found in the mere existence 
of so large a number of libraries that the de- 
mand from them alone is sufficient to take up 
a respectable edition of any work of real val- 
ue, suffieiient to insure agjainst loss, in any 
event, and frequently sufficient to provide a 
substantial profit. It is publishing of the 
spectacular and sensational sort that has rea- 
son to fear the influence of the libraries, not 
the legitimate and conservative publishing 
which alone has claims upon our sympathy. 



THE LIBRA RIAN AS CRITIC. 

The distinguishing feature of the library move- 
ment at present is its wonderful expansion. In ad- 
dition to the usual sources of income, the gifts to 
libraries in the United States during the last two 
years have amounted, in round numbers, to $30,- 
000,000. A vast deal of energy is expended in 
controlling and organizing this movement in order 
that its benefits may cover the widest possible area. 
So broad is the interest in libraries, and so much 
a matter of course is their existence in fa\ured 
communities, that it is time, perhaps co put a 
stronger emphasis upon their more f.urictly educa- 
tional work. 

It is beginning to be evident that many libraries 
whose history falls within the recent period of 
library development, having experienced their first 
enthusiams, are now coming properly to a sober rec- 
ognition of the fact that a great popular educational 
movement, in order to amount to anything, must 
grip close to scholarship ; to the extent at least of 
appreciating its aims, endeavoring to share its spirit, 
and striving to use its methods, as far as possible. 

The highest type of public library in a large city 
is probably one which comes in contact with readers 
of all stages of development, from the grade schools 
to the university, in addition to the ungraded public 
of all degrees of intelligence. 

It is the librarian's critical faculty, chiefly, which 
is called into requisition on the part of those who 
need it, for the promotion of this better use of books 
which is to resiUt in a larger body of readers of 
sound tastes less widely removed from the plane of 
scholarly habits. This function of criticism, broadly 
speaking, is exercised through the library by dis- 
crimination in the selection of books, by skilful cat- 
aloguing, and by the personal work of the library 
staff in encouraging a proper student habit. This 
being the animating spirit of all good librarians, it 
may not be out of place to examine a little in detail 
some of the means by which it is sought to carry out 
these ideas. 

The librarian's critical work begins where the 



critic in print leaves off. He must supplement the 
work of the critic by seeing to it that the " right 
book goes to the right man." This well-worn phrase 
means that, in default of any other guidance on be- 
half of the uncertain inquirer, it is the privilege of 
the librarian to suggest the book which will best 
apply to the need of the moment. As he is so ob- 
viously bulwarked by great stores of learning — at 
least in the eye of the applicant, — he is able to 
present what he has to offer, even though it may 
consist o"f but a single reference, gained at the cost 
of much research, without falling into the error of 
didacticism, the especial " tutorial " failing which 
made Stevenson's father willing to snub the entire 
race of schoolmasters. 

The critic who commits his judgment to writing, 
pronouncing upon the skill and capacity of the 
author, and in giving a final opinion concerning 
the especial distinction of the volume under review, 
comes to the conclusion of his task so far as the 
work in hand is concerned. The librarian is very 
grateful to him, reading everything he has to say 
with pleasure and profit, and subsequently confirm- 
ing, rejecting, or modifying somewhat the recorded 
opinion as it is tested by abundant application to 
varying needs, continued, perhaps, for years after 
the critic has placed the final period to his pages. 
But certain kinds of expert criticism he is occa- 
sionally obliged to do away with altogether. The 
scholar who presents the results of his own re- 
searches in a history, the best of the popular kind, 
intended to make its appeal to the foremost intelli- 
gence of a class of busy readers who can not pos- 
sibly command time for the more exhaustive works, 
may find the whole intent of the work overlooked, 
its drift and purpose ignored, and its general use- 
fulness set aside, for a discussion of certain technical 
defects which blind the critic to the general merit 
of the work. 

Take the case, also, of the historical novel. The 
librarian in his position as a public official need not 
fash himself over the conflicting views of the lit- 
erary merits of the historical novel as an art form. 
He well knows that the best of them delight thou- 
sands of readers, making their appeal equally to the 
confirmed reader of history and to the neophyte in 
historical knowledge. The former reads with the 
double satisfaction of interest in the story and of 
the exercise of his critical faculties upon the histor- 
ical representation; the latter finds in it a stimulus 
to an interest in history which hitherto he may 
have lacked. Our recent American literature con- 
tains many excellent productions of this kind which 
were enjoyed as stories and which were often fol- 
lowed by deeper reading. 

"The Crisis," for instance, created a new in- 
terest in the entire period of the Civil War. It was 
fortunate to have at hand such an admirable, com- 
pact history of American politics as Professor 
Macy's "Political Parties in the United States, 
1846-1861" and Mr. Morse's "Life of Lincoln,"

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



with which many eager readers supplemented the 
novel. In even so comparatively slight a work as 
Archdeacon Brady's " The Southerners " there is 
one chapter detailing a dinner table conversation 
which is of considerable value in setting forth the 
variety of opinion at the South upon the political 
situation just before the war. Of Mr. Page's 
" Red Rock " it is hardly too strong a statement 
to say that it absolutely opened the eyes of many 
readers at the North to conditions at the South 
during reconstiniction days. In " Richard "Carvel " 
we have in the colonial lawyer, Henry Swain, a 
character which finely illustrates the arrival of a 
distinctly new American type, one created by the 
freer opportunity to the individual which the chang- 
ing social conditions were already bringing about. 
Miss Johnston's "Audrey," pure romance though 
it is, is remarkable for the variety of its pictures, 
the lights and shadows, heights and depths, breadths 
and colorings of Virginia colonial society ; all of it 
quite as true to fact as the beguilement of the story 
would persuade us into imagining. These examples 
are taken at random from recent fiction, because it 
is in the current historical novel that the special 
opportunity of the librarian lies. The great mas- 
ters are beyond question. Scott, Hugo, Kingsley, 
Auerbach, Shorthouse, for instance, have their fixed 
place and value in the interpretation of liistory, 
awaiting, their discovery by each new generation of 
readers. 

The primary grade of the personal work of the 
library consists in much downright suggested in- 
struction to the youthful reader upon the proper use 
of books ; the correct way of handling and of opening 
a book, an observation of the title-page, the advan- 
tages of referring to a table of contents instead of 
clumsily turning the leaves ; some comprehension of 
the index as a useful tool, and the desirability of 
noting an authority once consulted in order to avoid 
subsequent efforts to recover it by means of vague 
allusions to its color and size. It is surprising what 
can be found in the ordinary dictionary if one has 
never thought of it before. Observe the encyclopae- 
dias — there are so many of them and they are of 
such different kinds. Then there are the gazetteers, 
the maps with all sorts of information, the '* alma- 
nacs," the "year-books," the "chronologies," the 
"digests." An unaccustomed reader soon becomes 
self-reliant by an intelligent use of all these helps. 
A great advance has been made when it is possible 
to distinguish between the magazine article written 
with authority and that which is the work of the 
industrious compiler ; or, when a compilation merely 
is wanted, to know which ones are well done. 

The education of the reader makes further prog- 
ress in his knowledge of the use of catalogues and 
bibliogi'aphies. A catalogue may be regarded as an 
exposition of the contents of a collection of books; 
a bibliography, as a descriptive list of books bearing 
upon a special subject. Full cataloguing furnishes 
the foundation stones from which bibliographies are 
constriictedt A good annotated bibliography of a 



subject comes very near being a critical history of 
that subject. In our own country this feature of 
library work was not much attended to, previous to 
twenty-five years ago. At the present day much is 
done of a high order of merit and of an extreme 
degree of usefulness. A few libraries in widely 
scattered portions of the country have already made 
a beginning in the compilation of bibliogi'aphies of 
the local history of their respective sections. In all 
work of this nature the Library of Congress is tak- 
ing the lead through its Department of Bibliography, 
both by way of issuing useful publications on its 
own account, and by serving as a bureau of inform- 
ation in regard to the progress of bibliographical un- 
dertakings throughout the states. As examples of 
the kind of " reading lists " coming from the Library 
of Congress the following may be mentioned : Trusts, 
Reciprocity, Interoceanic Canals, Federal Control of 
Commercial Corporations, Negro Question, Indus- 
trial Arbitration. As to the outlook upon the field 
of bibliography, it is the intention of the Department 
to keep students informed from time to time through 
the columns of the "Library Journal." 

Perhaps it is too much to claim for the influence 
of the library that its work in bibliography has af- 
fected the publishers ; but, at all events, it is true 
that coincident with this accomplishment inside the 
library, almost all publications of worth have now 
attached to them the bibliographies of their re- 
spective subjects. It goes without saying that this is 
frequently the most valuable portion of an encyclo- 
paedia article. Indeed, it is now so much the fashion 
to furnish " lists of authorities " or " bibliographies " 
with each new publication, that unfortunately it 
involves the appearance of some with but slender 
claim to consideration. A book without an index, 
too, has its usefulness so hampered that few in these 
days of little leisure make their appearance without 
that indispensable aid to quick and sure reference. 
A little note in each issue of the " Library Journal " 
calls attention to current publications lacking this 
feature. 

The library is now so well established as pur- 
veyor to the public that it ought to be able to gather 
up a pronounced concensus of the demand for va- 
rious branches of reading. It is not a point, to 
be sure, upon which statistics can be had, but the 
library must often, it would seem, be the means of 
interpreting this demand to the publisher. In spite 
of the appearance of many brilliant books of travel, 
especially of those relating to travel in the orient, 
good books of description are still needed, particu- 
larly those which deal with the beaten track of the 
tourist in Europe and the East. There has been an 
improvement within the last few years, but the com- 
ing in of cheap processes of illustration has made it 
easy to dispense with the instruction of the narra- 
tive. Many of the descriptive books of fifty or 
seventy-five years ago are fuller in treatment, more 
accurate, and altogether more satisf actoiy as sources 
of information than some of the more recent ones 
which miss the art of being direct and simple in

statement. Good books covering the field in our 
own country are very scarce. 

Some excellent commercial geographies have 
come to us of late. More can be used. There is 
still room for popular histories of commerce, his- 
tories of various industries, milling, mining, manu- 
facturing; short definite treatises on the economic 
relations of botany, ornithology, and entomology; 
popular histories of transportation, especially of the 
railway systems of our own country. Librarians 
probably have no classified lists of these wants, but 
frequently in the course of their labors are they 
reminded of the number of useful books yet to be 
written. 

The library's most pronounced success in the way 
of serious reading is perhaps in its response to the 
demand for books of sociology in general, and in 
particular for those relating to the labor question, 
civics, and mmiicipal affairs. Books like Dr. Glad- 
den's "Social Facts and Forces," published a few 
years ago, and the more recent Brooks's "Social 
Unrest" and Bolen's "Getting a Living" have 
helped to clarify the opinions of countless readers. 
Countless more have awakened to an interest in 
American history. 

It would be interesting to find out, if it could be 
discovered, whether it is the imperfect discipline of 
a defective education, or the reaction from an un- 
fortunate religious training, or whatever the cause, 
that is leading so many people to read such "queer" 
things in religion and philosophy. An interesting 
experiment was recently tried at one of the library 
schools whereby it was sought to construct a ladder 
which should be the means for the lovers of crude 
fiction to climb into higher regions of enjoyment, 
beginning with such established favorites as Mary J. 
Holmes or Augusta Evans Wilson and reaching 
by degrees a permanent liking for the good things 
of Mrs. Oliphant, TroUope, Charles Reade, and 
sometimes, eventually, even for George Eliot. A 
similar progression from the amorphous writings of 
some unclassifiable ones — let them be nameless 
here — to Professors Hoffman, Mttnsterberg, or 
William James, for instance, ought not to be en- 
tirely impossible. Professor Hoffman, in his preface 
to " Psychology applied to Common Life," has the 
following interesting statement : " Not many gener- 
ations ago the all-absorbing theme was physics, and 
little attention was paid to other studies. Later 
biology became the dominant science and gave di- 
rection to the current of thought. Now psychology 
has come to the front and holds undisputed sway." 
This opinion is one in which the librarian, from his 
observation of the public, can heartily concur. 

In noting the progress of the intelligent reader 
there is no opportunity to dwell upon the finer re- 
lationship of the library to lovers of pure literature. 
After aU, that kind "cometh not so much with ob- 
servation." The intelligent reader does not always 
develop into the "gentle reader," but when he 
does the librarian has reached his ultimate reward.

ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 

To the list of remarkable old men whose work made 
bright the century just behind us may now be added the 
name of a remarkable old woman, who has just closed 
a life unique in literature, noble in its endeavor and its 
fulfilment, and yet who was but a name to thousands of 
persons who were deeply her debtor for pleasure and 
for instruction. Of her interesting life I am sure the 
readers of The Dial will be glad to have this account. 

Mary £lizabeth Wormeley Latimer was born in 
London on the 26th of July, 1822. She was the six- 
teenth in line of direct descent from Sir John de 
Wormele, of the Manor of Hatfield, 1312, — and the 
sixth, from Ralph Wormeley of Rosegill, in Virginia, 
who was one of the founders of William and Mary Col- 
lege. Her father, a later Ralph Wormeley, was born in 
Virginia in 1786, but was taken to England in his boy- 
hood, bred as an Englishman, entered His Majesty's 
navy, and served so long and in so distinguished a 
manner, as to reach the rank of Rear Admiral before 
his retirement. After many daring deeds on many seas, 
and in many old sea-fights, he returned to America 
long enough to woo and win Miss Caroline Preble, the 
daughter of an old East Indian merchant of Boston, 
whose brother. Commodore Edward Preble, was one 
of the heroes of our early navy. 

A child so born could hardly help having an outlook 
on life out of the ordinary. It was London to-day, 
Boston or Newport to-morrow, then Virginia, then En- 
gland again, in the rather unsettled life of the parents 
who ere long had four merry little children to look 
after; and in the family migrations, and at her father's 
house, she saw a thousand sights, and heard a thousand 
stories, which formed the broad and solid foundation on 
which rested her quick appreciation of different points 
of view: the wide outlook upon public affairs, and the 
intense interest in everything which pertained to hu- 
manity, which stood her in such good stead in the years 
which were to come and made her one of the most 
delightful of companions. Nothing could be more full 
of drollery than were her tales of her life as parlor 
boarder in a little school kept in Ipswich — sacred to the 
memory of Mr. Pickwick! Mrs. Cockle, the mistress of 
the school, was the widow of the inventor of some fa- 
mous pills, and was herself greatly interested in antiq- 
uities and relics of the most unusual sort. She went out 
a great deal in the very Cranford-like society of Ips- 
wich, taking the little girl with her for safekeeping, 
little imagining how the bright eyes of the child who 
sat beside her in her sedan chair were noting the 
costumes and manners of the ladies discussing the per- 
missibility of having a lump of sugar in their tea, lest 
they thereby participate in the crime of human slavery ! 

Mrs. Latimer well remembered attending the funeral 
services of William IV. and the apprehension that filled 
all England lest the young girl who was to be his suc- 
cessor be found unequal to the great task before her. 
With her mother, she had a place at a window close to 
the great door of Westminster Abbey, through which 
the girlish Victoria went to her coronation. From the 
hour in which she saw that little royal figure, until the 
day when she replaced the pink bow in her point-lace 
cap by a black one in token of her sorrow for the death 
of the aged Queen, her love and loyalty never wavered,

and she followed every step of that wonderful reign 
with a passion which made her one of its most appre- 
ciative interpreters. 

In the London of the days when Mr. Stevenson, Mr. 
Everett, and Mr. Bancroft represented our country at 
St. James, the Wormeleys were constantly seeing all 
that was best in English society. Admiral Wormeley's 
position and his personal charm made for his family a 
most enviable acquaintance, which the quiet elegance 
of his wife did much to enhance. One of the Virginia 
cousins, John Randolph of Roanoke, was a frequent vis- 
itor at this time. In 1839, after the charming fashion 
of the old days, the family made a leisurely journey 
through France. They were in Paris when the remains 
of Napoleon were brought thither from St. Helena, and 
Elizabeth witnessed the splendor of that second funeral. 
She made her debut at the balls of Louis Phillippe, of 
whose uncourtly court she had a score of interesting 
stories. In Paris, too, the Wormeleys were intimate 
in the family of a tall young man who had brought his 
two little girls thither to be reared by his mother, their 
own being hopelessly insane. He was just printing a 
novel the success of which seemed to be extremely 
doubtful — « Vanity Fair " ! 

In 1842 Elizabeth came over to America to visit the 
family of William H. Prescott, the historian, meeting 
all who were worth while knowing in the Boston of that 
splendid day. She, and the bevy of young girls of whom 
the brilliant Julia Ward (Howe) was the leader, danced 
and laughed as girls should do, but they read and 
studied also, and the atmosphere of the home in which 
Mr. Prescott was doing his historical work had a great 
influence on her after-life. She later went back to En- 
i;land, where she constantly met many delightful per- 
sonages, and here she printed the first novel she cared 
to acknowledge, " Amabel." In 1851 her only brother, 
James Preble Wormeley, a man of most brilliant prom- 
ise, died, and two years later her father set sail on far 
vaster seas than any he had hitherto sailed. The family 
had returned to New England by that time, and the 
Admiral, as well as the son who had preceded him, and 
the wife who followed twenty years later, sleep in the 
old Newport burying ground. 

In 1856 Miss Wormeley married Mr. Randolph Brandt 
Latimer, a civil engineer connected with the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad. Mrs. Latimer's life for twenty years 
after this event was bound up in that of her husband, 
her children, and her home, broken by an occasional 
visit to her mother, in Newport, or by the duties of 
caring for the sick, the wounded, and the imprisoned 
soldiers of the Civil War. In 1876, however, she 
entered literature as a serious profession. Her fre- 
quent contributions of stories, poems, and essays made 
her style so well known to the readers of the best maga- 
zines that it was not singular that some good guessers 
traced to her hand the authorship of three of the clever- 
est novels of the clever " No Name Series " which 
delighted the readers of twenty years ago. These were 
«« The Princess Am^lie," " My Wife and My Wife's 
Sister," and « Salvage." 

Her life-work was crowned by the brilliant series of 
historical works in which she reviewed the affairs of 
Europe during the Nineteenth Century. It was a vast 
work for any woman to have undertaken; it was mar- 
vellous that one past the three-score and ten of the 
Psalmist's limit should have even contemplated such a 
task. With sight always feeble, and becoming more 
impaired each year, she read ceaselessly, she worked 



ceaselessly. She translated, she collected, she arranged, 
she wrote with an industry which was prodigious. En- 
gland, France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Turkey, India, with 
a supplemental volume, «« The Last Years of the Nine- 
teenth Century," — it is a noble catalogue, that of those 
charming books; and yet, alas ! 

"The unfinished window in Aladdin's tower 
Unfinished must remain" — 
and the volume on Germany, on which she was at work 
when a sudden fall, and the death of the husband to 
whom she had been devoted for nearly fifty years, 
stayed forever the busy hand, will never be completed. 

Uniform with these books last named, Mrs. Latimer 
published " My Scrap-book of the French Revolution," 
a storehouse of material otherwise unobtainable, and a 
most readable history of Judea ; and she produced a 
mass of translations from the French, among them, " The 
Love Letters of Victor Hugo" and "The Unknown" 
by Camille Flammarion. Her last published work, 
which appeared last Fall, was finished after her eighty- 
first year had closed, and was a work which has made 
every student of the life of Napoleon Bonaparte her 
debtor — " Talks of Napoleon at St. Helena," a con- 
densation and translation of General Gourgaud's notes. 

Mrs. Latimer spoke rapidly, and with the mostcharm- 
ing English accent. She was an admirable story teller 
and an admirable listener as well. She had a hearty 
appreciation of good literature, liking new books, but 
going back faithfully to the old writers. Her extreme 
short-sightedness had shut her away from the world of 
pictures, and she used to say sadly that she had never 
been able to see the natural world about her. She 
died in Baltimore on the Ith of January.

DR. PARKIN AND THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In your interesting and undoubtedly just article en- 
titled " A Perverted Trust," in the issue of The Dial 
for January 16, you make one slight misstatement. 
Dr. Parkin is in one place said to be " president of a 
Canadian college," and again, " himself a college presi- 
dent," and the implication clearly is that this fact 
influenced him in recommending the granting of the 
Rhodes scholarships to college graduates, rather than 
to graduates of preparatory schools. As a matter of 
fact Dr. Parkin is, or at any rate was until a short time 
ago (I think he resigned his position to take charge of 
the Rhodes scholarships), principal of Upper Canada 
College. Though the name is somewhat misleading, 
Upper Canada College is a preparatory school, pat- 
terned after the great public schools of England. It 
is to all intents and purposes the preparatory school for 
Toronto University, as the school at Port Hope is for 
Trinity University, Lennoxville school for Bishop's 
College, and the school at Windsor, N. S., for King's 
College. Consequently Dr. Parkin made his recom- 
mendation (whether it was just or unjust) as principal 
of a preparatory school, not as president of a college, 
and one is forced to the conclusion that, in deciding 
against the best interests of the class of educational 
institutions with which he was himself identified, he 
must at least have acted in good faith and without 
prejudice. Lawrence J. Burpee.

From Ensigx to Major-Genebal,.* 



Given the necessary facility as a writer and 
a glowing enthusiasm for one's profession or 
calling, what autobiography could fail to in- 
terest ? Surely not that of a born soldier and 
leader of men such as Lord Wolseley's " Story 
of a Soldier's Life " shows him to be. Even 
the most peace-loving of Quakers could hardly 
open the book without feeling a desire to read 
on. The narrative is brisk, varied, rich in 
Anecdote, and not untouched with humor — to 
say nothing of the inevitable horrors (or glo- 
ries) of war that furnish the main theme. 

Born in 1838, Garnet Wolseley was too 
joung to hold high command in the Crimean 
War ; but he showed himself a worthy son of 
•old Ireland (how many famous British generals 
Are Irish !) in the capacity of lieutenant. Then 
followed two years of service in the suppression 
•of the Indian mutiny of 1857; a few months 
in the China war of 1860 ; service in Canada, 
where he assisted in repelling the abortive 
Fenian invasion and headed the expedition sent 
to suppress the insurrection at Fort Garry in 
the Red River territory ; and finally, so far as 
this book is concerned, he planned and carried 
out the Ashantee campaign that humbled King 
Koffee and left the English masters of the 
•Gold Coast. Two months' leave of absence 
from his Canadian post in 1862 enabled him 
to visit Lee's headquarters and to get an inside 
view of the Confederate situation, as may be 
seen by reading his anonymous article entitled 
" A Month's Visit to the Confederate Head- 
quarters," in Blackwood's Magazine for Janu- 
ary, 1€63. In breaking off just as he reaches 
" the last of life, for which the first was made," 
Lord Wolseley has withheld the most valuable 
of his reminiscences ; but these, he leads us 
to hope, may follow in a later work. A brief 
outline of his life since 1874 will serve to hint 
at the riches he still holds in reserve for his 
readers. He was appointed inspector-general 
of auxiliary forces in 1874 ; governor of Cyprus, 
1878; governor of Natal, 1879; commander- 
in-chief of the British forces in Egypt, 1882 ; 
was raised to the peerage as reward for ser- 
vices in that country ; conducted the Gordon 
relief expedition, 1884-5 ; was made ad jutant-

general in 1885, commander-in-chief of the 
forces in Ireland, 1890, and commander-in- 
chief of the British army (succeeding the Duke 
of Cambridge) in 1895. Finally, as it will be 
remembered, he retired from this last office in 
1900, being succeeded by Lord Roberts. 

Like all men of true courage. Lord Wolseley 
is finely sensitive in temperament, even to such 
a degree that he declares the sight of raw meat 
has always nauseated him. The essence of 
genuine fortitude has not escaped him in his 
love for the clash of arms. Of certain effemi- 
nate officers of the famous Light Brigade he 
writes that they had "fought well and had 
nobly led their men straight ; but yet they 
lacked the manliness to bear for any length of 
time the hardships and discomforts their men 
experienced daily." Continuing, he indicates 
that the strenuous life is not necessarily that 
led by the soldier. 

" He must be a craven indeed, who, being well 
mounted, would not charge home at the head of his 
own men. It is not thus the noblest form of courage 
is made manifest, but in the daily endurance of cold 
and want." 

The following extract will throw light on 
this question of courage in battle, and will at 
the same time show that, like so many other 
military leaders, the author is somewhat of a 
fatalist, a " man of destiny." 

*' I have often been asked by foolish people if I never 
felt nervous when in danger. I don't think that many 
men when in action have time to be nervous, or at least 
to analyze what is the real condition of their feelings 
on the point. But I often thought to myself before the 
bullets began to whistle near one, whether I should be 
killed or not that day. I can honestly say the one dread 
I had — and it ate into my soul — was that if killed I 
should die without having made the name for myself 
which I always hoped a kind and merciful God might 
permit me to win. All through my life — sinner though 
I have been — I trusted implicitly in God's providence, 
I believed He watched over me and intended me for 
some important work. My numerous hair-breadth 
escapes in action confirmed me all the more in what 
perhaps others may deem my presumptuous belief." 

Before leaving this subject, it is worth while 
noting one situation which, though the author 
makes but modest mention of it, must have 
been a severe test of courage. The transport 
which took him and his company to the Orient 
in 1857 struck a reef in the Straits of Banca. 
Captain Wolseley's men were occupying a por- 
tion of the lower deck well forward, and there 
he was obliged to draw them up and wait for 
the word of command that should permit him 
to lead them up a narrow ladder and through 
a small hatchway, and embark them in the 
ship's boats. Darkness, only made visible by

the glimmer from the hatchway, a rapidly in- 
creasing perpendicularity of the deck under 
foot, and a momentary prospect of the vessel's 
slipping off the rock that held her and plunging 
to the bottom, combined to make the situation 
a trying one. To be drowned like rats in a 
cage was the inglorious fate that threatened. 
Yet no one bolted, discipline was preserved, 
and at last an order from above ended the ago- 
nizing suspense. The young captain's control 
of his unseasoned company in this instance is 
significant of much, and prepares us for his 
subsequent rapid promotion. 

The story of the relief of Lucknow has 
often been told, but none the less will Lord 
Wolseley's account of it, especially of his own 
share therein, be found of the highest interest. 
One circumstance is likely to excite comment. 
Lord Roberts, who also participated in this 
hazardous expedition, has duly recorded in 
his recent book, *' Forty-One Years in India," 
Brevet-Major Wolseley's gallant assault and 
capture of the mess-house that formed so strat- 
egic a point on the outskirts of Lucknow. He 
has also related how, after the young officer 
had passed on to pierce an adjacent brick wall 
and open communications with the beleaguered 
forces, he himself, after two unsuccessful at- 
tempts and evidently with much personal dan- 
ger, raised the flag over the captured position. 
Now our author makes no mention whatever 
of this fellow-officer, although he does refer 
to the flag incident in the following rather re- 
markable manner : 

« Some one in after years asserted that I claimed the 
honour of having hoisted a Union Jack upon this Mess 
House when we took it. My answer was, that it was 
taken by my company, immediately supported by Cap- 
tain Irby's company, also of the 90th Light Infantry, 
but I did not know who the hero was that had hoisted 
a flag upon it: all I knew was that it was not I who 
had done so, and that no flag was hoisted upon the Mess 
House «rhilst I was in it, and as to what took place after 
my company had gone through it to take the Motee 
Mahul, I could say nothing." 

Is there here some lurking jealousy of his 
successor in office? The author declares in a 
prefatory note that naught has been set down 
in malice; but we do not even have to read 
between the lines to catch the personal note on 
many pages. The reader is left in no doubt 
of Lord Wolseley's profound contempt for all 
civilian war secretaries. Lord Cardwell ex- 
cepted, of the withering scorn he entertains 
for university-bred staff officers of no military 
experience, and of his poor opinion of a gov- 
ernment that refuses to see the necessity of 



preparing for war in time of peace. " When," 
he asks in despair, "will civilian Secretaries 
of State for War cease from troubling in war 
affairs?" The American civil war, as viewed 
by him, " contains many lessons for all non- 
military nations, ourselves for example, whose 
Army affairs are ruled in an absolute fashion by 
a political civilian War Minister." In the light 
of history not yet ancient, there is significance 
in his resentment against the cunning politician 
who, when anything goes wrong in the manage- 
ment of a campaign, " tries to turn the wrath 
of a deceived people upon the military author- 
ities, and those who are exclusively to blame 
are too often allowed to sneak off unhurt in the 
turmoil of execration they have raised against 
the soldiers who, though in office, are never in 
power." The last of these frequent reflections 
upon the havoc wrought by politicians in army 
matters finds its utterance, in a veiled form, in 
the closing words of the book. 

" Should my narrative interest the general reader^ 
it will be a pleasure to continue it to the date when I 
gladly bid good-bye to the War Office and ceased to 
be the nominal Commander-in-Chief of her Majesty's 
Land Forces." 

Another and more amiable personal feeling 
is repeatedly voiced in his allusions to this 
country. He declares our army to be, so far 
at any rate as its membership is concerned, the 
finest in the world, and West Point the best of 
military schools in any country. In another 
burst of eulogy he says, " Of this at least I am 
certain, that no outsider can have a deeper, a 
more sincere admiration than I have for their 
institutions, their people, their great soldiers 
and sailors, as well as for their writers and men 
of science." Again, in praise of patriotism, 
he indulges in the following panegyric of our 
country : " And may I not assert with equal 
confidence that it is because that sentiment 
so deeply influences the hearts of the United 
States people that they have become the fore- 
most nation in the world, far greater than 
Washington and his able colleagues could ever 
have hoped for or even dreamt of." Another 
appeal to our national pride is in his expecta- 
tion that we shall one day save the world from 
" the yellow peril "; for, as he thinks, China 
only wants her Napoleon or Peter the Great to 
enable her to do great things. " I have long 
selected them," he writes, referring to the 
Chinese, " as the combatants on one side at 
the great battle of Armageddon, the people of 
the United States of America being their op- 
ponents. The latter nation is fast becoming

the greatest power of the world." Is all this 
from the heart, or has the author a thrifty 
eye on his American reading and book-buying 
public? How explain such ready relinquish- 
ment of all claims to old England's unapproach- 
able preeminence among the world-powers? 

The pen portraits of Lee and Jackson as 
seen by our author in camp and field are among 
the best passages in the book. Of Lee he writes 
in terms of the most ardent admiration. 

" He was the ablest general, and to me seemed the 
greatest man I ever conversed with; and yet I have had 
the privilege of meeting Von Moltke and Prince Bis- 
marck, and at least upon one occasion had a very long 
and intensely interesting conversation with the latter. 
General Lee was one of the few men who ever seriously 
impressed and awed me with their natural, their inhe- 
rent greatness. Forty years have come and gone since 
our meeting, yet the majesty of his manly bearing, the 
genial winning grace, the sweetness of his smile and 
the impressive dignity of his old-fashioned style of ad- 
dress, come back to me amongst the most cherished of 
my recollections. His greatness made me humble, and 
I never felt my own individual insignificance more keenly 
than I did in his presence. ... As he listened to you 
attentively, he seemed to look into your heart and to 
search your brain. He spoke of the future with con- 
fidence, though one could clearly see be was of no very 
sanguine temperament. He deplored the bitterness 
introduced into the struggle, and also the treatment of 
the Southern folk who fell into hostile hands. But 
there was no rancour in his tone when he referred to 
the Northern Government. Not even when he described 
how they had designedly destroyed his home at Arling- 
ton Heights, the property on the Potomac he had in- 
herited from General Washington. He had merely 
* gone with his State ' — Virginia — the pervading prin- 
ciple that had influenced most of the soldiers I spoke 
with during my visit to the South." 

In sharp contrast with this portrait of the born 
aristocrat is that of the sturdy man of the people, 
Stonewall Jackson. 

" There was nothing of these refined characteristics 
in Stonewall Jackson, a man with huge hands and feet. 
But he possessed an assured self-confidence, the outcome 
of an absolute trust in God, that inspired his soldiers 
with an unquestioning belief in him as their leader. 
They did not ask him where he was going: they were 
content to follow him," 

Both of the portraits thus outlined are filled in 
with some elaboration by Lord Wolseley, who 
well likens Lee to the high-born cavalier, 
while Jackson was more after the pattern of 
Cromwell's Ironsides. 

The final campaign recorded is that con- 
ducted by the author against the Ashantees of 
the Gold Coast, in 1873-74. Its immense 
difficulties, to say nothing of the deadly cli- 
mate, make the narrative a thrilling one. It 
deserves a more extended reference, and in fact 
the book as a whole is worthy of more detailed 
notice. It falls easily into the same class as 



Lord Koberts's popular account of his life in 
India, and touches at one point on what that 
has given in graphic detail. Whether like that 
it will pass through fifteen impressions, besides 
one for the blind, in little over a year, remains 
to be seen. It deserves to be widely read.

A Composite History of our Country.* 



Perhaps no more disappointing book was 
issued from the press last year than the volume 
in the "Cambridge Modern History" devoted 
to the United States. The great but some- 
what elusive reputation of Lord Acton, who 
planned the series, the prestige of the Univer- 
sity whose name it bears, and the favorable 
impression produced by the volume on the 
Renaissance, combined to create an expectation 
that the volume on the United States would 
prove a valuable contribution to American his- 
tory. There is no other nation whose history 
presents so great a variety of interests within 
so short a period of time, and whose progress 
from insignificant beginnings to great achieve- 
ment has been so rapid. There is great need 
that some single volume should present in 
strong color and with a broad stroke the un- 
derlying forces of this wonderful development. 
Someway it was expected that the Cambridge 
History would furnish this picture, but it 
might have been foreseen that the production 
of a dozen writers, chosen in large part at long 
range upon the basis of their general reputa- 
tion, and working independently of each other 
and without unity of plan, would not be satis- 
factory. This at least the event has proved. 

The work of the editors seems to have been 
confined to the division of the subject matter 
into chapters and their assignment to various 
writers. The whole period was divided into 
twenty-one chapters, to which were added two 
of general review, making a total of twenty- 
three. This is very nearly the division orig- 
inally made by Lord Acton. Criticism of the 
work begins with this division. Its most strik- 
ing characteristic is the extraordinary amount 
of space devoted to military history. Seven 
chapters are filled with the purely military 
events of the French War, the Revolution, the 
War of 1812, and the Rebellion, making 
nearly a third of the whole volume. These

wars were great turning points in American 
history. What is needed is an explanation 
of the conditions that caused them, a brief out- 
line of their grand strategy, and a full state- 
ment of their objective and subjective results. 
Instead we have a mass of military details, 
and no satisfactory statement of causes and 
results. The details of military events have 
no bearing upon the study of underlying causes, 
and could not be sufficiently minute to serve 
the purpose of the student of military history 
or of military science. They are therefore use- 
less, and give the book an undesirable " drum 
and trumpet " cast. 

The twenty-three chapters of the volume are 
divided among thirteen writers, of whom it is 
stated that but five were chosen by Lord Acton. 
Of the thirteen, four are English and nine are 
American. Of the American writers, all but 
one are connected with colleges or universities, 
one as president and the remainder as profes- 
sors. Of the English writers only one appears 
to be engaged in teaching. As there is no 
uniform mode of treatment, there is no escape 
from the tedious process of reviewing the work 
of each contributor seriatim. There are four 
principal contributors. The colonial period 
is for the most part covered by Mr. John A. 
Doyle, the Declaration of Independence and 
the formation of the Constitution by Professor 
Melville Bigelow, the period from 1783 to 
1850 by Professor McMaster, and the Civil 
War by the late John G. Nicolay. Ten other 
chapters, either supplementary or summary, 
are furnished by the nine other writers en- 
gaged upon the volume. 

Few men are better acquainted with the his- 
tory of the English colonies in America than Mr. 
Doyle, but he lacks the powers of distinguishing 
between the vital and the accidental and of gen- 
eralization requisite for condensed statement. 
His chapters are a mass of details with which 
he seems himself impatient, but which he fails to 
show were the small beginnings of great things. 
There is no attempt to portray the forces back 
of the settlement of the different colonies or 
the forces operating within and characterizing 
them. As a single illustration, instead of show- 
ing how Antinomianism, by tending to subvert 
the Puritan theocracy, provoked persecution 
and contributed to the New England disper- 
sion, he dismisses it with the statement that 
" it can only be understood after a careful 
study of Calvinistic theology." Of the Revo- 
lution he says " no one can speak of the col- 
onists as loyal subjects goaded into rebellion 



by persistent ill treatment," but does not suf- 
ficiently explain the causes that did bring 
about separation. There is no adequate ac- 
count of the sacrifice of colonial to British 
interests, of the operation of the colonial sys- 
stem, and of the gradual differentiation of col- 
onies and mother country. The chapters are 
not even accurate in details. Franklin's plan 
of union was not approved by the Albany Con- 
gress, but referred to the assemblies with the 
certainty that it would be rejected ; the re- 
lation of the North Carolina Regulators to 
the Revolution is misunderstood ; James War- 
ren is confused with Joseph Warren ; the pro- 
visions of the transportation act and the cir- 
cumstances of Andre's capture are misstated ; 
Jay, whose influence was so important, is not 
mentioned in connection with the negotiation 
of peace, and Laurens appears as Henry 
Somers. 

The assignment of an historical sketch of 
the theory of the Revolution and the forma- 
tion of the Constitution to Mr. Bigelow is not 
very different from the employment of an his- 
torian to try a case in court. In the treatment 
of the first topic Mr. Bigelow subjects a num- 
ber of contemporary pamphlets upon both 
sides to careful legal analysis, the result of 
which is an interesting essay, that especially 
develops the extent to which the idea of nat- 
ural right was embodied in the common law 
but fails to meet the requirement of a history 
of revolutionary opinion. The essay conveys 
the impression that the colonial argument was 
fixed and stable, whereas it shifted as the 
struggle advanced and passed through at least 
four distinct phases. Even less satisfactory is 
the chapter on the Constitution. Mr. Bigelow 
begins with a sketch of the formation of the 
state constitutions, apparently with the pur- 
pose of pointing out the connection between 
them and the Federal Constitution, and then 
omits to show the relation. His treatment 
of the latter consists in tracing each one of 
Randolph's resolutions through the debates in 
the convention to its final form in the completed 
Constitution. This labor is performed with 
painstaking care, and the result is a useful 
piece of work, but it is the last thing needed 
in this particular place. Instead of it there 
should be a careful account of the movement 
that brought about the convention and a re- 
statement of the compromises between the con- 
tending forces within the convention. The chap- 
ter closes with but a single paragraph by way 
of comment, and that an erroneous one. It is 



1904.]

Mr. Bigelow's conclusion that Alexander Ham- 
ilton was the master spirit of the convention. 
This is a tradition, resulting from a confusion 
of the part that Hamilton played in bring- 
ing about the convention and in securing the 
ratification of the Constitution with his share 
in the convention itself. Hamilton's ideas were 
entirely out of harmony with those of the con- 
vention, very few of his suggestions met with 
approval, he was embarrassed by the majority 
against him in his own delegation, and felt that 
his influence was so slight that he did not at- 
tend a considerable part of the sessions. 

Professor McMaster covers the period from 
the devolution to the Compromise of 1850 in 
the well known style of his " History of the 
People of the United States." He tells the 
story chiefly for the purpose of giving " local 
color," but does not undertake the statement 
of causes and results. Genet appears in his 
pages as Genest, but more important is the 
omission of the real purpose of his mission. 
The statement of the European situation that 
produced the War of 1812 is not attempted. 
The story of nullification in South Carolina is 
told, but the momentous consequences of the 
virtual victory of the nullifiers are passed over 
in silence. The style glides smoothly from 
point to point without accentuation and conse- 
quently without perspective. Admirable as 
this may be for purposes of entertainment, it 
does not make much impression upon the mind 
or give much understanding of the subject. 
An entire volume written in this vein would 
meet a popular demand, but the method hardly 
seems suited to the purposes of this history. 

The standpoint of Mr. Nicolay's chapters on 
the Civil War is, of course, that of the Lin- 
coln History. Three of the four are devoted 
to military events, and about a third of them 
to the mistakes of McClellan. The single 
chapter on the political phases of the period is 
much too short to cover the subject. It is 
almost entirely devoted to the abolition of slav- 
ery. The financial history of the struggle is 
briefly reviewed; the period of uncertainty at 
the beginning, the shifting attitude of the 
North as the struggle advanced, the centrali- 
zation of government, which was the most im- 
portant subjective result of the war, and, what 
is especially surprising, all reference to for- 
eign relations, are omitted altogether. While 
the proportion of space given to military events 
and some of the views expressed may be open 
to criticism, the style of the whole is good. 

The shorter contributions must be passed in 



rapid review. In the chapter by Miss Mary 
Bateson, Lecturer in Newnham College, upon 
the French in America, the material is thor- 
oughly mastered, admirably organized, and 
well presented. It is a model of the mode of 
treatment which should have been applied to 
the whole book. The chapter on the French 
War by Mr. A. G. Bradley, an English author 
who lived for some time in the United States 
and is best known through his " Fight with 
France for North America," is an accurate but 
not very picturesque account of a very pic- 
turesque contest. Mr. H. W. Wilson, another 
English writer, covers the War of 1812 and the 
naval operations of the Rebellion. The partic- 
ular purpose of President Woodrow Wilson's 
chapter on the decade from 1850 to 1860 is to 
explain the point of view of the South, a pur- 
pose which is well accomplished, although he 
finds it necessary to devote half of his space to 
an earlier period. It is not correct to say that 
Utah and New Mexico were organized " with 
nothing said about slavery," and President 
Wilson seems to have missed the point that 
Kansas and Nebraska were organized under 
precisely the same conditions as were Utah and 
New Mexico. Douglas was the most promi- 
nent man in public life during the decade from 
1860 to 1860 and received in the latter year a 
larger vote for the presidency than any South- 
ern man. Here is a phenomenon which Presi- 
dent Wilson does not attempt to explain. 
Supplementary to the chapters on the Civil 
War, Professor Schwab furnishes one on the 
South during the War, which is an acceptable 
summary of his "Financial and Industrial His- 
tory of the Confederate States." The period 
since the war is divided between Professor T. C. 
Smith, now of Williams College, and Profes- 
sor John Bassett Moore of Columbia. Pro- 
fessor Smith covers the ground thoroughly and 
systematically to the election of President 
Cleveland, and is sound and outspoken in his 
judgments. The reconstruction part suffers 
from lack of space, but otherwise could scarcely 
be improved. Professor Moore reviews the re- 
cent diplomatic history of the United States, 
and closes with an account of the peace negotia- 
tions at Paris. He is absolutely noncommittal 
on all vital points, apparently considering that 
his former o£Bicial connection with the Depart- 
ment of State bars the expression of individual 
opinion. Two summaries, one of economic and 
the other of intellectual development, complete 
the volume. The former, written by Professor 
Emery of Yale, sets forth the extraordinary

agricultural and industrial expansion of recent 
years, and the latter, written by Professor 
Barrett Wendell of Harvard, presents judic- 
ious paragraphs on the progress of law, philos- 
ophy, art, science, education, and a somewhat 
longer sketch of American literature. Professor 
Wendell supplements the doubtful theory set 
forth in his "Literary History of America," 
that the American of the time of the Revolu- 
tion was a survival of the Elizabethan English- 
man, with the contention "that the country 
to-day is essentially the same which, in the 
reign of King George III., declared its inde- 
pendence of England," a contention that will 
hardly bear examination. The bibliography 
for the various chapters covers eighty pages 
and is reasonably full. 

Taken as a whole it is difficult to see what 
useful purpose the volume can serve. It is 
neither a collection of special studies for the 
student nor a survey of the whole field of 
American history useful for purposes of in- 
struction or suited to the needs of the general 
reader. There are a few good chapters, but 
most of them are condensed from books that 
are better still. A volume on the United States 
might have been omitted altogether. The series 
is a history of modern Europe, and European 
colonies the world over could have been better 
treated in connection with the parent state. It 
was the chief result of the Revolution that the 
United States was left free to develop its own 
institutions independently of Europe, and its 
history is no essential part of that of Europe. 
As it is, the volume will be placed upon the 
shelves as one of a notable series, but will be 
little read. y. H. Hodder. 



Modern Libbaby Management and 
Methods.* 



It is interesting to compare Mr. J. D. Brown's 
new " Manual of Library Economy " with such 
a book as Dr. Grasel's " Handbuch der Bib- 
liothekslehre," which appeared in a new and 
much enlarged edition more than a year ago. 
The German work, written by one of the 
librarians of the Royal Library in Berlin, is a 
scholarly treatise on the science of library 
administration, with particular reference to 
German scientific libraries. The author pre- 
sents the fundamental principles of library 
administration, and exemplifies them from the

actual working of libraries in Germany and 
other countries. He shows little enthusiasm, 
and has little to say in criticism of present 
conditions, merely stating the facts in a calm, 
judicious manner. Mr. Brown, on the other 
hand, is nothing if not an enthusiast. He has 
his decided views as to how public libraries 
should be managed, and when he finds a ten- 
dency which he considers dangerous, he says 
so in no uncertain language. He is librarian 
in one of the most progressive municipal libra- 
ries in Britain, and presents the actual working 
of that particular class of libraries, with very 
few references to conditions elsewhere. But 
what references he does give are pointed 
enough, — as when in his preface he says of 
American libraries : 

" In the United States a much higher level of attain- 
ment has been reached [than in France], but here again 
the paralyzing hand of uniformity has arrested progress 
after a certain standard of efficiency has become gen- 
eral. American libraries are conducted on lines which 
closely resemble those of ordinary commercial practice, 
in which everything is subordinated to the furtherance 
of profits and economy. Their methods are standard- 
ised, and everything is more or less interchangeable." 

The fact which is most forcibly brought out 
in regard to British municipal libraries is the 
limitation caused by the working of the library 
acts in regulating the percentage of the rates 
which may go to the support of the libraries. 

" The principal amendment of the Libraries Acts, 
which authorities of all kinds now agree is essential and 
paramount to everything else, is the abolition or altera- 
tion of the rate limitation, which for fifty years has 
fettered the work of public libraries and in every way 
hindered their proper development. ... If no limita- 
tion is placed upon the rates which can be levied for 
baths and washhouses, tramways, public health, lighting 
and education, it is surely an anomaly to retain on the 
Statute Book a restriction such as the fixing of the 
library rate, mainly, one supposes, because it was imposed 
about forty-seven years ago." 

The author of this book has long been an 
earnest advocate of " safeguarded open access," 
that is, of giving the public access, under pro- 
per supervision, to all or most of the books in 
public libraries, and the last chapter is a full 
statement of the arguments in favor of this 
plan, chiefly quoted from a pamphlet published 
in iy99 under the title "Account of the Safe- 
guarded Open-Access System in Public Lend- 
ing Libraries. Prepared and circulated by the 
librarians in charge of English open-access 
public libraries," and of which Mr. Brown 
presumably is the chief author. He says here : 

" The main object held in view by the advocates of 
open access is the extension of the usefulness of public 
libraries and books by enhancing their educational value 



1904.] 



THE DIAI. 



in a practical and satisfactory manner. ... To secure 
the end in view, methods of exact classification have 
been introduced into the safeguarded open-access libra- 
ries, by means of which it is possible to display to readers 
in one place the books possessed by the library on any 
specific subject." 

In this connection, as well as in the chapters 
especially devoted to that subject, the import- 
ance of classification of books on the shelves 
of public libraries is emphasized. 

" Roughly, the plan most in vogue in English public 
libraries is to establish from six to twenty main classes 
like A Theology, B Sciences, C Biography, D History, 
E Fiction, etc., and to number the books in each class 
consecutively as received, without regard to their sub- 
jects. ... A more chaotic and unbusinesslike arrange- 
ment probably does not exist anywhere, in any depart- 
ment of life, than in a numerically arranged English 
public library on the plan just described. It is a mere 
wilderness of books dumped down on the shelves, with- 
out regard to topic relationships, or even an elementary 
idea of order or consistency."* 

Besides an earnest plea for the general prin- 
ciple of classification, three systems are briefly 
examined, namely the "Decimal" by Mr. 
Melvil Dewey, the "Expansive" by the late 
Mr. C. A. Cutter, and the "Adjustable" by 
Mr. Brown. Somewhat more space is given 
to cataloguing ; various rules and methods are 
described, and the mechanical methods of dis- 
playing catalogues are fully treated. On this 
latter point the author comes nearer to making 
a comparative study of methods in various 
countries than in any other part of his book. 

The question of "live" and "dead" books, 
which has agitated American librarians for the 
last couple of years, is very forcibly treated 
from the standpoint of a " workshop " library 
which "provides for the systematic and con- 
tinuous revision of the stock." The subject 
is treated both in the chapter on buildings and 
in that on book selection. 

" The museum idea of a public library has been cul- 
tivated so long, that it is difficult to advance a plea for 
the more practical workshop idea without raising a storm 
of opposition from those conservators of literature who 
imagine that their little parochial libraries rival the 
British Museum or Biblioth^que Nationale on a reduced 
scale. Yet, it is this practical workshop side of the 
question which we desire to advance in opposition to the 
museum, or haphazard collecting, method, which has for 
years prevailed. ... No doubt the difficulty of selec- 
tion is the main reason why public libraries are allowed 
to grow up in a haphazard way, because it is a work 
which demands not only persevering industry, but an 
encyclopaedic knowledge of literature and the contents 
of books. Nevertheless, we regard this difficulty of 
selection, and the limitation of the field of selection, as 
powerful reasons why municipal libraries should com- 

* This kind of " classification " is not entirely unknown in 
■American libraries. 



pletely abandon the museum or storage ideal, and go 
boldly for making the workshop or practical utility 
ideal the one most worthy of realization. . . . Public 
library buildings should be erected, not on the principle 
of storing as many books as can possibly be collected 
in fifty years' time, but of restricting the book accom- 
modation to the reasonable limits which careful selection 
and cautious discarding will fix, and increasing the 
space available for readers, and giving them only the 
very best literature, imaginative or instructive, that 
the world has to offer." 

The chapter on book selection is one of the 
most interesting, and to American readers one 
of the most valuable, in the whole book. The 
author has here occasion to take issue with an 
American library primer which he thinks 
"may influence young librarians in a disas- 
trous fashion," as when its author recommends 
buying largely of the cheap books issued in 
"series" or "libraries," which, as Mr. Brown 
points out, " are too often commercial ventures 
got up to sell by people who have nothing par- 
ticular to say." 

The author sounds a note of warning in re- 
gard to the particular attention that has lately 
been given to children's libraries. 

" With all respect for the admirable work in con- 
nection with children's libraries and the cultivation of 
intimate relationships with the public schools, both in the 
United States and Britain, there is a very grave danger 
of this particular outlet for library enthusiasm becom- 
ing a damaging influence on the interests of the general 
work of public libraries. Already there are libraries in 
the United States and in England where everything is 
subordinated to the special cult of the child, and where 
the claims of adult readers are being brushed aside in 
the pursuit of what is largely a sentimental phantasy. 
. . . There are strong and reasonable doubts as to the 
wisdom of treating juveniles like a separate class of 
human beings, and making all kinds of arrangements 
for their convenience, very often to the inconvenience of 
adults." 

In this connection it should, however, be re- 
membered that in many neighborhoods chil- 
dren are the only persons who can or care to 
avail themselves of the services of public libra- 
ries, and also that something must he done out- 
side the schools to interest children in reading 
for reading's sake and to instruct them in the 
use of books as tools. When the writer says, 
"to many observers, it must appear as if the 
school educational authorities in America and 
the United Kingdom had failed lamentably in 
their duty of providing elementary education, to 
warrant such interference on the part of libra- 
rians," he has perhaps touched the real root of 
the matter. 

The foregoing might be enough to give 
an idea of the general character of the book 
and the purpose of its author. Besides the

chapters here briefly noticed, those on heat- 
ing, lighting, ventilation, cleaning ; on printed 
catalogues ; on reading room methods and sub- 
sidiary departments, deserve particular atten- 
tion. Altogether, it is an admirable work, and 
one that deserves to be carefully read by Amer- 
ican librarians and library trustees. Though 
especially dealing with English conditions, 
the book is full of suggestions of value to libra- 
rians in any country, particularly in the United 
States. 

Each chapter is followed by a short list of 
references, chiefly to articles in library period- 
icals. That these references are not as numer- 
ous as those in Dr. Grasel's "Bibliothekslehre " 
is an advantage to the student. There are 
some rather curious omissions, however, and 
some inaccuracies, — which latter might be for- 
given the author of "Practical Bibliography" 
(see " The Library," 1903, p. 144 ff.). Presi- 
dent Eliot's address before the American Li- 
brary Association in 1902 on " The Division 
of a Library into Books in Use, and Books out 
of Use," seems to be unknown to Mr. Brown, 
though the subject is one in which he is par- 
ticularly interested. The list under the chapter 
on " The Librarian " should contain reference 
to Gtasel's " Bibliothekslehre," which contains 
a special appendix of great interest on " The 
Library Profession," besides the chapter on 
" The Qualifications of a Librarian." Mr. 
J. L. Whitney's report on, or rather against, 
the advisability of printing a new catalogue 
of the books in the Boston Public Library 
(A. L. A. conference 1900) should be read 
by all who are interested in the question of 
printed catalogues, but it is not mentioned in 
the short list of three (3) references on this 
subject. Mr. Archibald L. Clarke's interesting 
"Essays on Indexing," now running through 
"The Library World," should also have been 
mentioned, as well as Mr. Henry B. Wheatley's 
article " The British Museum Revised Rules 
for Cataloguing" ("The Library," 1900). 
The list of cataloguing rules on p. 277 is rather 
inadequate. Even the revised British Museum 
rules are omitted. Granted that this book is 
principally for English librarians, the omission 
of such important codes as Dr. Dziatzko's and 
that for the Prussian libraries is very singular. 
If the book-titles given on p. 66-71 as " The 
Librarian's Library " had been arranged by 
subjects instead of alphabetically, it would 
have been more useful. Some of the books in 
this list are marked by a star to indicate their 
being " parti uularly desirable." Why Cush- 



ing's " Initials and Pseudonyms " should be so 
marked, but not his " Anonyms," is not easy 
to understand ; nor why the first edition of 
Cutter's " Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue " 
should be more desirable than the third. That 
Mrs. Dixson's " Subject- Index to Universal 
Prose Fiction " is starred can only mean that 
the author is not familiar with it. By Bolton's 
" Catalogue of Technical Publications 1665- 
1882. Washington, 1887 " is of course meant 
his " Catalogue of Scientific and Technical 
Periodicals" of which the first edition, cover- 
ing the years 1666-1882, was issued in 1886, 
and the second, carrying the list down to 1896,^ 
appeared in 1897. Why Mr. Fletcher's " Co- 
operative Index to Periodicals" for 1886 should 
be especially desirable and the previous annual 
volumes uot even included in the list is hard 
to understand, — particularly as they are all 
superseded by the first supplement to Poole'a 
Index. The omission of Mr. Fletcher's "A. L. A. 
Index to General Literature," of which th& 
first edition came out in 1893 and the second 
in 1901, and which is an indispensable tool for 
any library, is presumably unintentional. That 
Langlois's " Manuel de Bibliographic Histor- 
ique," Paris, 1901, is the second edition of th& 
first part (all that so far has been published), 
is not indicated. At last it seems somewhat 
curious to find, in such an " up to date " book 
as Mr. Brown's, Petzholdt's "Katechisums der 
Bibliothekenlehre," 1866, marked as " par- 
ticularly desirable." This book has now chiefly 
an historical interest, and is for all practical 
purposes superseded by Dr. Grasel's often 
mentioned " Handbuch der Bibliothekslehre," 
whose previous edition, " Grundziige der Bib- 
liothekslehre," was a recast (" Neubearbeit- 
ung") of Petzholdt's book, as still is told on 
the title-page of the 1902 edition.

The Charm of Cookert Books.* 

Thoreau, referring to the addition of a pat- 
ent stove to the furniture of his Walden hut, 
said that henceforth cooking would be for him 
not a poetic but a chemic process. Most of us, 
if the truth were told, would admit that we had 
never thought of cookery in any other than the 
latter light. And as for cookery-books, knowing 
in our darkness only the oilcloth-covered vade 
mecum of the kitchen, we have naturally re-

garded their omission from Lamb's catalogue 
of biblia a-biblia merely in the nature of an 
oversight, or more likely an intentional exclu- 
sion of the obvious. 

To reveal the poetic charm that once at- 
tached to cookery, to prove that the cookery 
book may be the most delightful of literature, 
and no doubt also to gratify the proper pride 
of a collector in an unrivalled collection, has 
been the threefold aim of Mrs. Pennell in 
writing her account of "My Cookery Books." 
She scatters our careless illusions on the sub- 
ject at the outset. 

" The cookery book has every good quality that a 
book can have. In the first place, it makes a legiti- 
mate appeal to the collector, and M. Vicaire and Mr. 
Hazlitt show what the bibliographer can do with it. 
Man, the cooking animal, has had from the beginning 
a cooking literature. What are parts of the Old Tes- 
tament, of the Vedas, but cookery books ? You cannot 
dip into Athenseus without realizing what an inspiration 
food and drink always were to the Greek poet. As for 
the Romans, from Virgil to Horace, from Petronius to 
Lucian, praise of good eating and drinking was forever 
their theme, both in prose and in verse. Early French 
and English historical manuscripts and records are full 
of cookery; and almost as soon as there was a printing- 
press cookery books began to be printed, and they have 
kept on being printed ever since. It would be strange 
if, among them, there were not a few that provided the 
excitement of the hunt and the triumph of conquest." 

Mrs. Pennell is not of those who collect for the 
mere sake of collecting. She reads her cookery 
books, and, moreover, considers that they make 
the very best sort of reading, — an opinion 
which readers of her own book will be quite 
ready to share. Indeed, so persuasive is her 
charm, that at the end one finds himself bitten 
with a like enthusiasm, and feels tempted forth- 
with to begin haunting the book-shops in search 
of such delightful treasures as are here de- 
scribed. 

It is in her shelf of seventeenth-century 
English books, ranging from Gervase Mark- 
ham's " English Housewife " to Giles Rose's 
"Perfect School of Instructions for theOflficers 
of the Mouth," that Mrs. Pennell finds great- 
est pleasure. Here are such noted names in 
gastronomical annals as Robert May and Will 
Rabisha; here also we find the inimitable 
" Closet " of Sir Kenelm Digby, who cultivated 
this tenth muse of cookery no less assiduously 
than his politics or his theology. May and 
Rabisha were types of the professional cook, 
the expert in culinary science. But Sir Kenelm, 
the amateur, is more truly representative of his 
century. He is the connoisseur in epicurism, 
writing from the heart rather than the head, 
and clothing his instructions in language as 



quaint and refreshing as that of Pepys or 
Montaigne. 

"The cookery books are full of this brocaded lan- 
guage, full of extravagant conceits, full of artificial 
ornament; a lover writing to his mistress, you would say, 
rather than a cook or a housewife giving practical 
directions. After the modern recipe, blunt to the point 
of brutality; after the < Take so much of this, add so 
much of that, and boil, roast, fry,' as the dull case may 
be, each fresh extravagance, each fresh affectation, is 
as enchanting as the crook of Lely's ladies or the Silvio 
of Herrick's verse. I should not want to try the recipes, 
so appalling often is the combination of savories andi 
sweets, so colossal the proportions. But they were 
written by artists who had as pretty a talent for turning 
a phrase as for inventing a new dish. Rose leaves and 
saffron, musk and • amber-greece,' orange flower andi 
angelica, are scattered through them, until it seems as- 
if the feast had been spread only for Phillis or Anthea. 
And no water can be poured into their pots that is not. 
'fair,' few blossoms chosen as ingredients that are not 
•pleasing.' Cakes are ' pretty conceits,' and are gar- 
nished 'according to art.' If cider leaves its dregs,, 
these are ' naughty,' and a sweet is recommended be- 
cause it 'comforteth the Stomach and Heart.' The 
names of the dishes are a joy: the tanzies of violets or 
cowslips, and the orangado phraises; the syllabubs and 
the frumenties, — ' all- tempting Frumenty'; the wiggs 
and pasties; the eggs in moonshine; the conserves of 
red roses; the possets without end, almost as lyrical as. 
the poet's, made 

' With cream of lilies, not of kine, 
And maiden's blush for spiced wine.' 
And the drinks: metheglin, — do we not know to the 
day the date of Pepys' first ' brave cup ' of it? — meath, 
hydromel, hypocras, — a word that carries one to the- 
Guildhall buttery, a certain Lord Mayor's day, where 
Pepys is gayly tippling; hypocras ' being to the best of 
my present judgment only a mixed compound drink, and. 
not any wine,' which he had forsworn by solemn vow. 
<If I am mistaken, God forgive mel but I hope and 
do think I am not.' " 

Coming to the eighteenth century, we reach 
the choicest gem of the collection, and indeed 
the most noted volume in all culinary bibli- 
ography, — a first edition in "pot folio" of 
Hannah Glasse's "Art of Cookery." Mrs. 
Pennell has particular reason to rejoice in her 
copy, for it reposed at one time in the library 
of George Augustus Sala. It is not a littla 
distressing to find that the phrase by which 
good old Hannah Glasse is now chiefly remem- 
bered, the famous " First catch your hare," is 
here set down as apocryphal. But in the ac- 
tual identity and mundane existence of the 
lady herself, whom some critics (presumably 
dyspeptic) have chosen to regard in the light 
of a culinary Mrs. Harris, firm belief is ex- 
pressed by our author. The cookery-book of 
Hannah Glasse, as she herself modestly dis- 
claims, is "not wrote in the high polite stile " 
so typical of her day, but the taste of its deli- 
cious quality afforded in these pages makes u»

wish that some publisher would honor it (and 
himself) with a fitting reprint. 

With May and Eabisha came, as we have 
said, the professional element in English cook- 
ery affairs. Soon thereafter began the inva- 
sion of the French chefs, whose " kickshaws " 
and " messes " at first excited the contempt of 
patriotic Britishers, but before long found per- 
manent places on the national bill of fare. 
Between the increasing strength of these two 
influences, the amateur is effectually silenced 
by the middle of the eighteenth century, or 
soon after Hannah Glasse's day. Henceforth 
there are no more little confidences between 
cook and consumer, no more flattering compro- 
mises to the individual taste, no more little 
allegories and dainty mysteries. Now it is 
the master-cook, or chef, bolstered up with a 
pedigree of service in various kitchens of the 
nobility, who from the fulness of his expert 
knowledge loftily directs us to do thus and 
so, exactly that and no more. Though the 
charm of manner, the refreshing naivete, is 
not always lacking in these latter eighteenth- 
century books, as a rule the tone is too pon- 
tifical to be edifying. Often, too, disdain of 
the amateur's flowery periods leads to a de- 
pressing bluntness. 

" ' Stick your pig just above the breast-bone,' says 
Mrs. Elizabeth Raffald, without any preamble; 'run 
your knife to the heart; when it is dead, put it in cold 
water.' Whoever, after that, would eat of her pig has 
more courage than I." 

With the beginning of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, Mrs. Pennell stops short in her account. 
For here the book on cookery seems to change 
its character completely, becoming for the most 
part the dull practical affair that all of us are 
familiar with, the prosaic " kitchen Baedeker," 
lacking always in grace and not seldom in 
sense. 

Though she devotes an interesting chapter 
to the foreign books in her collection, it is evi- 
dent that here Mrs. Pennell loves rather by 
allowance than with personal love, — to use 
Walt Whitman's distinction. Following this 
chapter is the Bibliography, occupying more 
than a third of the entire volume. The author 
has not attempted to rival M.Vicaire, with his 
2500 entries. She has done no more than 
prepare a descriptive list of the books that she 
herself owns, — and even this within certain 
stated limits. The work is done extremely 
well, and this part of the book, aside from its 
value for reference purposes, is not less inter- 
esting than the rest. 



We should like, were it possible, to devote 
as much space to the form of Mrs. Pennell's 
volume as we have to its matter, so excellent 
an example is it of distinguished bookmaking. 
Produced by the Riverside Press in an edition 
limited to 330 copies, it well sustains the repu- 
tation of that concern for results in artistic 
printing hardly equalled by any other Amer- 
ican press. It is quarto in size, printed on 
unbleached Arnold handmade paper, from a 
plain modern face of type, the page being 
altogether devoid of ornamentation. The bind- 
ing is a combination of marbled paper sides 
and linen back, with paper title-label. A num- 
ber of illustrations, consisting of old portraits, 
title-pages, colophons, etc., in facsimile, add a 
pleasing antiquarian air. These are printed 
on paper of antique appearance, and mounted 
on blank pages throughout the book. So suc- 
cessful is the process of reproduction and 
printing, that these illustrations have every 
appearance of the originals, and even an expert 
might, at first glance, think that the volume 
had been extra-illustrated directly from Mrs. 
Pennell's collection. ^aldo R. Browne. 



An Italian LiAdy op the Renaissance.* 

Without doubt Isabella d'Este was the most 
distinguished woman of the Renaissance. She 
was well born and well educated, she filled a 
conspicuous position with conspicuous ability, 
she was beautiful, and she had good health. 
She was twenty years old at the time of the 
French invasion, in 1494; she died in 1539, 
her long life thus stretching through the mo- 
mentous years of the decline and fall of Italy. 
Into the dramatic struggle between pope, em- 
peror, France, and the Italian states, Isabella 
d'Este was born, the eldest daughter of Ercole, 
second Duke of Ferrara, and head of the oldest 
family in Italy, save that of Savoy. At the 
age of sixteen, Isabella was married to Fran- 
cesco Gonzaga, fourth Marquis of Mantua. 
Through her father, her mother, and her hus- 
band, she was related to most of the actors in 
the great national tragedy. Her mother was 
Eleonora of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand, 
King of Naples, and the young King Ferdi- 
nand, who lost Naples to Charles VIII. of

France, was her cousin. Her younger sister, 
Beatrice d'Este, married Lodovico Sforza, 
called II Moro, that Duke of Milan who in- 
vited the French into Italy, and thereby lost 
his duchy and died miserably in the dungeons 
of Loches. Elizabetta Gonzaga, her sister-in- 
law and most intimate friend, was the wife of 
Guidobaldo Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, 
whose state was twice treacherously seized, once 
by Caesar Borgia, and again by Lorenzo dei 
Medici. Elizabetta Gonzaga was celebrated 
alike for her virtues and her misfortunes, and 
is the Duchess of Urbino whose praises are so 
devotedly sounded by Count Baldessare Cas- 
tiglione, in II Cortegiano. Another kinsman 
was the Connetable de Bourbon, son of 
Isabella's sister-in-law, Chiara Gonzaga and 
Gilbert de Montpensier. The marriage of 
Lucrezia Borgia to Isabella's brother, Duke 
Alfonso d'Este, made a connection with the 
papal court of Alexander VI., and led later to 
a second French alliance, when Lucrezia's son, 
Duke Ercole II., married Renee, daughter of 
Louis XII. and sister to Queen Claude. By 
these various marriages the little court of 
Mantua became personally related to the courts 
of Ferrara, Naples, Milan, Urbino, Eome, 
and France. The marriages reveal the state- 
craft of the time. Isabella d'Este was no 
match-maker, but she was the clever woman 
of her family, much cleverer than her hus- 
band, who was a blunt soldier, a better gen- 
eral than diplomatist, and often absent in the 
field. On these occasions he left his wife to 
govern the marquisate, and her success in 
maintaining the integrity of a small and com- 
paratively poor state through more than forty 
years of incessant war and intrigue, in which 
almost everybody else went down, sometimes 
more than once, explains Cardinal Bembo's 
eulogy of her, "the wisest and most for- 
tunate of women." An extant letter from 
Isabella d'Este to her son, the first Duke of 
Mantua, shows that in general she considered 
the papal alliance safest for Mantua. But at 
this time, 1521, she had already permitted 
the young Federico to make a long visit at 
the French court, and later she entertained 
the Emperor, Charles V., magnificently in 
Mantua. 

The most dramatic bit of politics in which 
Isabella d'Este was engaged, characteristic at 
once of her and of her time, is the story of the 
red hat. She determined that her third son, 
Ercole, should be a cardinal, and had in vain 
asked for his elevation from Pope after Pope. 



When Clement VII. was elected to the Holy 
See, in 1525, Isabella, who had been a widow 
for six years, went to Rome to be on the spot. 
There she took the Colonna palace and there 
she remained for two years, never so completely 
absorbed in collecting works of art as to lose 
sight of the cardinalate. Pope Clement hesi- 
tated, intrigued, and put her o£f, and Isabella^ 
went on buying medals and antiques. Guic-^ 
ciardini quotes the French ambassador, Du 
Bellay, to the effect that when the imperial 
allies were actually under the walls of Rome the 
terrified Pope summoned Renzo da Ceri and 
ordered him to collect at once one thousand men 
to defend the city. But it was impossible to 
raise as many ducats. In his extremity Pope 
Clement thought of the lady in the Colonnai 
palace. He appointed five new cardinals, each 
of whom paid forty thousand ducats, about half 
a million dollars, into the papal treasury. On. 
Sunday, May 5, 1527, Cardinal Pizzino carried 
a red hat to the Marchesa of Mantua in the 
Palazzo Colonna. The sack of Rome began at 
dawn on Monday, May 6. The one obstacle 
that Isabella d'Este could not overcome until 
the stress of the eleventh hour was the fact that 
her nephew, the Connetable de Bourbon, was 
leading the imperial army, and her second son, 
Ferrante, was captain of a Spanish troop in it. 
This string to her bow now saved her. The 
palace of the Marchesa of Mantua and the 
Cancellaria, occupied by Cardinal Colonna,. 
were the only two houses in Rome that escaped 
spoliation. For a week Isabella was practically 
a prisoner, but at the end of that time her son 
Ferrante, with a strong Spanish guard, escorted' 
her out of Rome. She carried with her many 
art treasures collected during the two years, 
and the red hat, which she had the pleasure 
herself of placing on her son's head. Ercole 
Gonzaga was in his twenty-second year when 
his mother made him a cardinal ; he was forty 
when he presided over the Council of Trent. 

It is, however, in her relations to the art and 
literature of the Renaissance that Isabella 
d'Este is most interesting. She was an intel- 
ligent and, for her means, munificent patron of 
art, and employed agents in all the large cities 
of Italy to keep her informed as to what was 
going on in the world of art and archaeology. 
The sculptor, Christoforo Romano, was her 
confidential adviser for many years. Christo- 
foro's friend, the Knight Templar Fra Sabba 
da Castiglione, exiled to the island of Rhodes, 
wrote to her that in the garden of the Grand 
Master there were " many excellent sculptures

lying despised and uncared for, exposed to 
•wind and rain, which made him feel as if the 
bones of his father lay unburied." The Mar- 
•<5he8a of Mantua collected her art treasures in 
'her Studio of the Grotta in the castello, a suite 
of rooms whose walls were hung with pictures 
by Mantegna, Costa, Perugino, Bellini, and 
Correggio. A series of these pictures, now in 
the Galerie des Sept Metres of the Louvre, 
were called " triumphs " and were produced by 
successive orders of Isabella d'Este in carrying 
•out a general scheme. Having a definite idea 
of the " triumph " she wished depicted, Isabella 
communicated it to the humanist poet, Paride 
da Ceresara, who returned to her an elaborate 
fantasia of the subject. This fantasia she sent 
to the painter, together with threads showing 
the exact dimensions of the proposed picture, 
and information as to the place it was to oc- 
cupy, the light, neighboring pictures or objects 
in the Studio, and the like. Braghirolli counted 
'fifty-three letters written by Isabella d'Este to 
the artist and her agents before Perugino's 
•*' Triumph of Chastity " was finally hung on 
her walls. The only great painter out of whom 
'Isabella got no work was Leonardo da Vinci. 
The fantasia in this case was simple enough, 
" a youthful Christ of about twelve years," but 
Leonardo could not be brought to tie his genius 
to a lady's ribbons, and the picture was never 
painted. This fact may not be without signifi- 
cance as to the red chalk drawing in the 
Louvre, reputed to be of Isabella d'Este by 
^Leonardo. Mrs. Ady accepts the repute and 
furnishes a copy of the drawing for the front- 
ispiece of the first volume of her work. Signor 
(Luzio, director of the Eoyal Archives of Man- 
tua, in an article in the Emporium on Isabella's 
portraits, declines to accept the drawing as her 
likeness, and indeed a comparison of the front- 
ispiece with the medal portrait of Christoforo 
iKomano, figured at page 170, would seem to 
sustain Signor Luzio's judgment. Apart from 
the doubtful drawing in the Louvre, it is a 
-question whether any woman of the Renais- 
sance sat more often to artists than Isabella 
■d'Este. At different ages, her portrait was 
painted by Raphael's father, Giovanni Santi, 
by Andrea Mantegua, the Mantuan court 
painter, by Gianfrancesco Maineri, by Lorenzo 
Costa, by Francia, and by Titian twice, an 
original and a copy of Francia. In the seven- 
teenth century Rubens copied both of Titian's 
portraits. It is a pity that Titian's original 
portrait, described in the inventory of the 
pictures of Charles I. as a " Duchess of Man- 



tua, in a red gowne," came to light in England 
only last year, too late to be printed in Mrs. 
Ady's book. 

There was something Greek in Isabella 
d'Este's type of mind, art-loving and full of 
intellectual curiosity, ever desirous to learn 
some new thing, desiderosa di cosa nova, as 
she said of herself. She carried on a large 
correspondence and had a curious faculty for 
getting early news of things. Messer Pandolfo 
Pico della Mirandola wrote to her Easter Eve, 
1520, of the death of Raphael on Good Friday 
night : 

" Here we talk of nothing but the death of this great 
man, who has ended his first life at the age of thirty- 
three. His second life, that immortal fame which knows 
neither time nor death, will endure eternally, both by 
reason of his works and by the labors of scholars who 
will write his praises, and who will find in him a never 
failing theme." 

"Within five weeks after the JVina dropped 
anchor in the little harbor of Palos, the news 
reached Mantua that " a man named Colum- 
bus has lately discovered an island for the 
King of Spain, on which are men of our height 
but of copper-colored skin, with noses like 
apes." 

One of the most interesting of Isabella 
d'Este's correspondents was the papal nuncio, 
Francesco Chiericati, who gave her a great deal 
of information about the lands and peoples he 
visited in the course of various diplomatic mis- 
sions. Chiericati introduced to her his servant, 
the chevalier Antonio Pigafetta, of Vicenza, 
who, " for to see the marvels of the ocean," 
accompanied Magellan in the first circumnavi- 
gation of the globe. Pigafetta went to see 
Isabella at her request and took with him his 
journal kept during those three years 

" Of moving accidents by flood and field," 

which Chiericati had described to her as "a 
divine thing." 

A letter from Chiericati to Isabella dated 
Middelburg, Zealand, 28th August, 1517, con- 
tains an entertaining account of his trip to 
Ireland, during the summer of that year, to 
see the celebrated Purgatory of St. Patrick in 
Lough Derg. The papal legate prudently de- 
clined to enter the purgatorial cave of the 
saint, but waited outside for his companions 
for ten weary days, during which time, he says, 
he ate up the greater part of the food of the 
pilgrims, who were fasting within on bread 
and water. The comfortable nuncio did not, 
however, escape purgatory after all, for on the 
return journey, he records of Down : " In this

place I could not walk about the streets with- 
out being pursued by people, who came running 
out of their houses to kiss my clothes, when 
they heard I was the Pope's nuncio, so I was 
forced to stay in. Such is the annoyance which 
arises from over-much religion ! But the good 
bishop [an Italian] treated me very kindly, 
and gave me some excellent fishing." 

Isabella d'Este's library of the Grotta was 
quite as unique as her paintings, sculptures, 
and objets d'art. For fifty years she collected 
books, not only rare manuscripts and illumi- 
nated books, but French and Spanish romances, 
the Aldine classics, Latin translations from the 
Greek, and contemporary Italian literature. 
Poets, novelists, and humanists alike sent their 
works to the great lady who read everything. 
Trissino described her in his JRitratti^ and sent 
her a canzone, to " My Lady Isabella playing 
on the Lute," which celebrates her charms at 
the age of forty-seven. Bernardo Tasso pre- 
sented her his book of poems, II Lihro degli 
Amori, with a pretty letter. Once during an 
illness, her brother. Cardinal d'Este, dispatched 
Ariosto to her, who beguiled the weariness of 
convalescence by reading to her the Orlando 
Furioso. Later the poet sent her a copy of 
the third edition of his poem, containing the 
famous lines in her praise, beginning 

" D^opere illustre e di bei studi arnica " 
By way of thanks Isabella invited Ariosto to 
Mantua to meet the Emperor Charles V. 

The novelist, Bandello, lived for two or 
three years in the Dominican monastery in 
Mantua, and many of the ladies and gentlemen 
of Isabella d'Este's court figure in his pages. 
There is the Marquis Francesco, fond of rough 
jests ; his brother Giovanni, " as honest and 
sensible a man as ever lived"; Paride da Cer- 
esara, " a man after the heart of Terence, qui 
nihil humani a se alienum putat" ; Aldo Man- 
uzio, the printer ; Pomponazzi, the skeptical 
Bolognese professor ; Alessaudro Baesso, Isa- 
bella's seneschal, " old in years, but singularly 
merry in disposition"; and Madama herself, 
coming into the company announced by the 
barking of her pet dogs, and perhaps starting 
a discussion on the distinction between wit and 
humor. Oddly enough, Bandello dedicates to 
the serene and correct Marchesa of Mantua his 
tragical story of the loves and crimes of the 
Countess of Celant, " The Insatiate Countess " 
of John Marston. The dedication is of a piece 
with the letter Isabella d'Este wrote for Ban- 
dello, vouching for his " religious and modest 



life," and begging the vicar-general of the 
Dominicans " to hold him dear, and to honor 
him as his infinite virtues deserved." 

Isabella d'Este was a woman of the Kenais- 
sance. Unlike Vittoria Colonna and Mar- 
guerite of Valois, she was not affected by the 
new doctrines of the Reformation. In Ariosto's 
phrase, her religion was " that of other people." 
Her fate as a wife was not different from that 
of women of her time generally, but her own 
family relations were simple and domestic. 
Although she led an active life, full of many 
interests, she was the mother of eight children 
of whom she reared six. An anecdote related 
in the Ferrarese Archives illustrates Isabella 
d'Este's personal attitude towards contempo- 
rary manners. At the marriage of her brother, 
Alfonso d'Este, to Lucrezia Borgia, she refused 
to allow any of her ladies to be present at the 
representation of Plautus's comedy, Casina^ 
which she described as " immoral beyond 
words." 

This play, by the way, Mrs. Ady calls Cas- 
saria, confusing Plautus with Ariosto. It is 
unfortunate that with her undoubted gift for 
popularization Mrs. Ady has not known better 
her limitations. More discreetly she might 
have written an entertaining account of Isa- 
bella d'Este in one volume. Instead, she prints 
an imposing array of authorities which have 
the flimsiest relation to her text, or none at 
all, and her publisher has had to pay an in- 
demnity to the two Italian scholars most griev- 
ously exploited. Mrs. Ady has agreed not to 
sanction an Italian translation of her book. If 
it comes out again in English, it is to be hoped 
that it will be carefully revised. The readable 
English style leaves something to be desired in 
taste as well as grammar. Raphael as " the 
Urbinate," St. Peter as " the Prince of the 
Apostles," and Lucrezia Borgia " washing her 
head " run on all fours as English, and it is 
not English to the manner born. 

Proper names throughout Mrs. Ady's work 
are most uncertain. " Girolamo da Casio " 
(I. 320) appears as " Girolamo di Casio " 
(IL 311) and "Girolamo Casio" (L 388). 
"Brogna" (I. 72) is "Brognina" (II. 81), 
but she is indexed as two persons (II. 396). 
It only adds to the mystery shrouding the fate 
of Michael Angelo's Sleeping Cupid to refer 
to it (I. 272) as "Michel Angelo's sleeping 
Cupids." And why should Mrs. Ady quote 
Shakespeare from the "Quarterly Review"? 
Mary Augusta Scott.

Briefs on New Books. 



wuhsievensonin ^^ August, 1887, with his mother, 
the Adirondack! wife, and stepson, Robert Louis 
and elsewhere. StevensoD Started for America and 
the Adirondacks in quest of health. After a rig- 
orous but bracing winter at Saranac, the party pro- 
ceeded to California and set sail in the yacht Casco 
for the Marquesas Islands. Having cruised about, 
with longer and shorter pauses at different points 
in the South Seas, they recrossed the line and found 
themselves in Honolulu at the end of January, 1889. 
Mrs. Margaret Isabella (Balfour) Stevenson, the 
proud and devoted mother of her famous son, left 
a pleasant record of these wanderings in letters 
home, now collected and published under the title, 
" From Saranac to the Marquesas and Beyond " 
(imported by the Scribners). The experiences 
chronicled are as varied as the degrees of tempera- 
ture experienced in passing from a winter in the 
Adirondacks to a summer in the tropics. To be- 
guile the tedium of the cruise, the party used to 
" decline and fall," after the manner of Silas Wegg 
and Mr. Boffin. With the dusky denizens of the 
southern seas they struck up friendly relations ; 
and it is this disposition to enter into the spirit of 
all that was new and interesting and wholesome 
that made their outing so enjoyable to themselves, 
and Mrs. Stevenson's account of it so entertaining 
to the reader. The editor, Miss Marie Clothilde 
Balfour, has supplied footnotes, an index, and fifty 
fine-print pages of illustrative matter drawn from 
a considerable range of sources, notably from 
Herman Melville, whose vivid pictures of south-sea 
life are regarded by Miss Balfour as more trust- 
worthy than they are commonly considered. For 
some reason she repeatedly refers to bis '' Omoo " 
as " Omua." Two unfamiliar portraits of the boy 
Stevenson and three of his mother are among the 
illustrations. An Introduction by Mrs. Stevenson's 
brother, Dr. George W. Balfour, contains some 
items of interest concerning the Balfour family 
and the old manse where they lived. 

Possibly no other of our American 
futud/amai. poet-dramatists has Mr. Francis 

Howard Williams's acquaintance 
with the technique of the stage. As a result, the 
three little dramas in his new volume, '■'■ At the Rise 
of the Curtain " (Badger), seem ready-made for the 
use of the theatre. The speeches in them are short, 
there is a continual movement, and theatrical effects 
abound. The pieces are tragic in theme, though the 
last one ends happily. The longest, " Holyrood," 
is a new study of Mary Stuart, a projection of the 
scenes incident to the murder of Biccio. We are 
inclined to think that nothing the Queen of Scots 
did in her lifetime was so deplorable as the apolo- 
getic histories and plays she has been the occasion 
of since her death. Scott's picture of her was 
frankly romantic, and, slurring over the darker 
passages of her history, is full of charm. Schiller's 



play is cast in large dramatic form, but as far as 
reality is concerned, is hardly more than a myth. 
Mr. Swinburne's vast and elaborate apology for 
and explanation of her character seems to us poor 
drama and poor art. A thoroughly bad woman, 
who is admitted to be bad, may be a great dramatic 
figure, vide Cleopatra and Becky Sharp ; but a bad 
woman who poses, or is posed, as rather better than 
an angel, is simply detestable. Mr. Williams does 
not apologize for Mary, and he has at least given 
the essentials of her character and situation in terse, 
bright form. The other two pieces we think are 
much better. '< Nemesis " is a story of Milan, of the 
fifteenth century. It relates the revenge planned by 
Alfeo, a court jester, against Sforza, the great mer- 
cenary captain of the day, for the seduction of his 
wife. It is told in terse lines full of wit and fire, 
and is worked up to a thoroughly dramatic crisis. 
In fact, the acting capabilities of the piece seem to 
us remarkably good. We are not sure that psy- 
chologically Mr. Williams has quite made out his 
case ; for the emotion of gratitude, which at the last 
moment overpowers Alfeo's hatred and makes him 
take upon himself the death he had planned for his 
enemy, seems to us a trifle overstrained. " Marie del 
Carmen " is the most human and beautiful of Mr. 
Williams's trio of curtain-raisers. It tells the story 
of a Spanish woman who hides and saves her hus- 
band from the search of a detachment of French 
soldiers. The situation is this : Her husband is 
hidden in the house, and she is given half an hour 
to disclose his hiding-place on the penalty of the loss 
of her baby. Meanwhile a sentry is placed over 
her, and her business is to use her time in moving 
the soldier to permit her husband's escape. There 
is a vague resemblance in the situation to that 
scene in Dumas where Lady Winter seduces the 
Puritan officer Fenton from his duty. But Mr. 
Williams's heroine works only with the noblest and 
most exalted means of persuasion, and it is a tribute 
to her purity and devotedness that we feel the 
sentinel hero is justified, in the end, in yielding to 
human emotion, and, by the most direct dereliction 
of duty, aiding the escape. 

A Massachusetts woman of mature 
aZZZZ'^ years. Jeft a widow just prior to the 

outbreak of the Civil War, found re- 
lief for her sorrow in the vocation of nurse in the 
hospitals of the Union Army on the Atlantic coast. 
The advent of the Franco- Prussian war, in 1870, 
spurred her again to the same occupation ; and, 
going to Germany, she succeeded, after some diffi- 
culty, in securing employment in the Prussian 
field and post hospitals in France. Out of this 
duplicated experience came numerous letters to 
friends in Massachusetts, from this nurse, Mrs. 
Mary Phinney von Olnhausen, and a fragmentary 
" Diary " or "Autobiography," written by her at the 
time. These have been preserved by her friends, 
and since her death have been edited by loving 
hands, and made the basis of a newly-published 



1904.] 



THE DIAIi

volume entitled " Adventures of an Army Nurse 
in Two Wars " (Little, Brown, & Co.) The hos- 
pital services of this lady during the Civil War 
were so efficient as to win her hearty conamendation 
while that war was still going on, and their illus- 
tration in these reminiscences will revive the war- 
time recollections of many readers. These papers 
have not been so over-edited as to rob them of the 
flavor and feeling of the strenuous time in which 
they were written, and their genuineness and 
contemporaneousness are unmistakable. Mrs. von 
Olnhausen was a keen observer and an interesting 
narrator. Her description of the deficiencies and 
hardships of a " convalescent camp " of the Civil 
War is faithful and vivid, as the writer of this 
notice can testify from his own recollection of a 
similar institution of the same period. The harsh 
treatment which military necessity often imposed 
upon wounded and sick soldiers, the unnecessarily 
rough conduct of some army surgeons, the genial 
manners of many others, and the embarrassments 
surrounding a woman nurse in camp and hospital, 
are all sharply portrayed. Contrast is inevitably 
suggested between the best work of the medical 
profession in those days and surgical achievements 
in more recent years. But it is notable that this 
experienced and capable nurse testified, at the time 
of the Franco-Prussian war, to the inferior work of 
the surgeons in that conflict, as contrasted with 
the accomplishments of American surgery nearly a 
decade earlier. What she relates of the malingering 
of some of the rank and file, the quest of inefficient 
officers for "soft places," and the eagerness of 
both active and inactive holders of position, in both 
staff and line, to divert to their own use supplies and 
dainties intended for the sick, seems a prophetic 
suggestion of the greed and "graft" with which 
the American public is recently becoming too pain- 
fully familiar. The eminently unselfish character 
of the work of this brave lady won for her the rare 
honor of the Iron Cross of Prussia. 



If ever a literary censorship is estab- 

Senrible articles t u j • iU- i j j; i^u r 

about book-bindinff. "^hed m this land of the free, it may 
well be on account of the exaspera- 
tion of the free with misleading and inexact book- 
titles. The careless christening of a book is often- 
times the reason for its only fault, but it is a most 
trying blemish. Miss S. T. Prideaux has made a vol- 
ume of eight magazine articles — pleasant articles and 
well-written, but nothing can be slighter than eight 
magazine articles unless it be nine, — to which she 
has given the name " Bookbinders and their Craft " 
(Scribner). It is an admirable title in itself, broad- 
minded, comprehensive, and would do so well on 
the back of an encyclopaedia that one is afraid, if 
Miss Prideaux ever publishes a really exhaustive 
volume, she will regret this early prodigality. They 
who are all the Bookbinders and half the title, are 
Roger Payne, treated individually; some modern 
French and some early Italians, treated collectively ; 
and some minor craftsmen and almost legendary 



schools of a somewhat crepuscular character, found 
in the byways aside from the great historic high- 
way along which the craft has developed and de- 
clined. There is also a review of " Les Relieurs 
Fran^ais " by M. Thoinan, and some notes on pat- 
tern-making. All in all the information contained 
is neither massive nor overwhelming, but the bouk 
has a distinct and grateful quality, being written 
with that interest which comes when long years of 
acquaintance with a subject has developed a recog- 
nition of essentials. The papers on " Some En- 
glish and Scotch Bindings," " Roger Payne," and 
" Early Stamped Bindings " have the most interest, 
partly from a sort of quiet aloofness of the matter 
and partly because Miss Prideaux's style of descrip- 
tion, which is somewhat quiet and aloof also, seems 
to fit the subject. It is very pleasant to find a 
specialist who can write about her subject with a 
modified rapture that maintains true values. Miss 
Prideaux does this, and if the historic light she 
turns on has not the full power of noon, it is how- 
ever a very pleasant dawn or twilight which, after 
all, is much better for some localities. Some of the 
things of which Miss Prideaux writes are interest- 
ing to happen on, to understand, and to know about, 
and none the less so because achieved through the 
medium of a cool, sane style that dominates adjec- 
tives and uses emphasis with all the discretion of a 
musical direction. "Ma non troppo" says the score, 
and Miss Prideaux somehow manages the "non 
troppo" — always excepting in the title. Her notes 
on pattern-making and design leave one calm in the 
same manner as the historical essays. They are 
not epoch-making nor revelations, but then there is 
no particular reason why one should expect them 
to be. As the unimpassioned utterance of Miss 
Prideaux's experience one can excuse them quietly 
and disagree with all if one will, without the 
acceleration of a single heart-beat, but always with 
the conviction that the lady has some knowledge 
of, and sympathy for, her subject. The book is of a 
convenient size, is nicely bound, and well illustrated. 

Some famous ^he essays contained in Mr. Andrew 

mysteries and Lang's latest volume, " The Valet's 
controversies. Tragedy" (Longmans), are described 

by their author as " studies in secret history." There 
are twelve of these studies, but only half of them 
really belong to the field of history. The initial 
essay is an effort to penetrate a little further into 
the mystery of the Man with the Iron Mask. Mr. 
Lang agrees with those who hold that this famous 
individual was merely an inoffensive valet who, it 
was feared, might be in possession of secrets which 
in reality he knew nothing about. While the author's 
theory and conclusion in the case seem plausible 
and are probably correct, they cannot be said to be 
fully established. The second essay is devoted to 
the valet's master, in the hope of throwing some 
light on the secret of the servant but confessedly 
without success. Of considerable interest is the 
study of the Amy Robsart mystery, which, how- 



92 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



ever, ia left unsolved. Still, the author does show 
that there is no basis for the charge that Queen 
Elizabeth had knowledge of Amy's impending death. 
The essays on the false Joan of Are, the murder of 
Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, and the fate of James 
de la Cloche (a natural son of Charles II.) are of 
minor importance. Students of literature will be 
interested in the ballad studies, " The Queen's 
Marie" and "The Mystery of Lord Bateman," in 
which the author displays extended knowledge of 
his subject and great familiarity with his field. In 
the closing essay the Shakespeare-Bacon contro- 
versy is taken up, and the claims of the Baconians 
subjected to a most searching analysis which clearly 
shows their position to be untenable. As a piece of 
literary polemics this is a brilliant effort. The 
remaining studies, dealing with such themes as the 
" voices " of Joan of Arc and certain historic ghosts, 
will doubtless interest students of psychology, but 
they can hardly be termed studies in secret history. 
The volume is of the popular type, and is written 
in Mr. Lang's vigorous though good-natured En- 
glish. While the essays do not contribute much 
toward the solution of the mysteries discussed, the 
author has accomplished something in the way of 
eliminating certain current errors, and the volume 
has its value.

upon the task of tracing the history of classical 
scholarship down through the centuries, from its 
beginnings in the Athenian age to the Revival of 
Learning. The volume now issued as a result of 
his researches comes only to the year 1350, as the 
mass of material has outgrown the limits originally 
set. A second volume is to follow, and is well on 
its way to completion. We had looked forward to 
this work with a lively hope that the subject would 
be treated in a readable manner, and the part of 
classical scholarship in the development of European 
civilization clearly and philosophically pointed out. 
We have read this initial volume through with a 
growing sense of disappointment. It is distinctly 
not readable, and it makes practically no attempt 
to fix the place of classical scholarship as a force in 
the development of the race. It is simply an enor- 
mous mass of facts about hundreds of men and a few 
women who gave more or less attention to the study 
of the language, literature, and art of Greece and 
Rome during the period in question. Large num- 
bers of these facts seem completely isolated and 
unimportant, and if Dr. Sandys was aware of any 
vital relation which they sustain to his subject he 
has denied his readers the benefit of his knowledge. 
The volume is divided into six " books," treating 
respectively of the Athenian Age, the Alexandrian 
Age, the Roman Age of Latin Scholarship, the 
Roman Age of Greek Scholarship, the Byzantine 
Age, and the Middle Ages in the West. The 
typical chapter in any one of these divisions is as 



indicated above, simply a collection of facts, with 
the veriest minimum of illuminating discussion, 
concerning individual "scholars." Perhaps very 
few classical scholars are satisfied with Professor 
Saintsbury's campaigns in their territory, but for 
any really vital knowledge of the subject of the 
book before us we should prefer to send the ordi- 
nary intelligent reader rather to the first volume of 
Saintsbury's " History of Criticism." We are sorry 
to make these strictures, for Dr. Sandys has here- 
tofore done great and lasting service to the cause 
of classical learning, both Greek and Roman. (Mac- 
millan.) 

It was hardly necessary for Mr. Sad- 
onJapar^eseart. ^kichi Hartmann to explam in the 

preface to his "Japanese Art " (L. C. 
Page & Co.) that the book is not intended for ex- 
perts and connoisseurs, so glaringly obvious is the 
author's lack of knowledge of his subject. Mis- 
takes that the merest tyro should have no difiiculty 
in avoiding abound on almost every page. In many 
instances the Japanese proper names are so spelled 
as to be almost unrecognizable; nor is there uni- 
formity in the orthographic errors. For Tokugawa 
we read " Takugawa," " Takigawa," and even 
" Fukugawa." Instead of Sakya-muni W3 have 
"Sakia"; the great Sessha is made to masquerade 
as "Sesshin''; Shokwado is metamorphosed into 
"Shioukada"; while as to " Husuyuma Moro," it 
would be a clever expert that could discover his 
identity. This list could be extended almost in- 
definitely. More serious is the distorted perspect- 
ive that exalts the artists of the popular school of 
the eighteenth century above the giants of the past. 
Kuniyoshi may have been " a wild unrestrained 
talent, with an imagination that was neither to bend 
nor to break," but the world will scarcely agree 
with the author in regarding Utamaro as " the most 
ethereal of painters." And the explanation of that 
artist's reason for using geishas and courtesans as 
models is, to say the least, amusing. There is an 
excellent chapter on modern Japanese art, and an 
intelligent description of the technical methods of 
the Japanese painters. But the good in the book is 
so buried in the mass of misstatements, slipshod 
phrases, and "fine writing," that like Gratiano's 
reasons it may be compared to " two grains of wheat 
in a bushel of chaff." A few of the illustrations are 
well-chosen; one is placed upside down; and the 
plate entitled "lacquer-work " is a reproduction of 
a piece of cloisonn^ enamel. Mr. Hartmann as- 
serts that " in looking at a statue the optical con- 
ciousness can not readily be divided." Possibly 
this may apply also to looking at enamels !

wide topic to Mr. Herbert A. L. Fisher, whose first 
results are now presented in a volume entitled 
"Studies in Napoleonic Statesmanship in Ger- 
many " (Oxford University Press). The author 
tells us that "no complete history of the civil side 
of the Napoleonic Empire has yet appeared, and 
indeed, while so much material still remains unpub- 
lished and unexplored, it is unlikely that the great 
work will be accomplished in this generation." His 
present purpose is therefore to furnish a provisional 
account which, while not in any way claiming 
finality of treatment, shall at least be of value in 
indicating new lines of research. This purpose has 
been admirably fulfilled, for his treatment of condi- 
tions in Germany, both before and during the time 
of French control, is first of all notable in the evi- 
dence furnished of the vast unworked sources of 
information reposing in the archives of various 
German states. These Mr. Fisher has investigated 
sufficiently to affjrd him some striking and original 
results. Hanover, for example, is shown to have 
been burdened with such an antiquated and incom- 
petent form of government as to explain in part 
the readiness with which its citizens submitted to 
Napoleonic control. The facts here brought out are 
largely those of constitutional form and govern- 
mental machinery ; but the dryness of such descrip- 
tion is relieved by carefully drawn portraits of the 
men responsible for the working of that machinery. 
In other ways, also, Mr. Fisher has succeeded in 
relieving the tedium of minute investigation, for he 
has great discrimination in the choice of words, and 
much power in convincing summation. It is his 
purpose, if the work be well received, to follow it 
with volumes on France, Italy, Holland, and Bel- 
gium. Of that favorable reception there can be no 
doubt ; for even if, as is inevitable in studies of this 
nature, criticisms are made on the accuracy of this 
or that historical incident, there can be but one 
opinion of the service rendered by Mr. Fisher in 
opening a new field for historical investigation.

lished by Messrs. D. Appleton & 
Co., — "Bismarck's Letters to his Wife from the 
Sesxt of War, 1870-1871." In the letters published 
some three years ago those of this period were not 
included, and it was supposed that they were with- 
held because they might arouse animosity in official 
circles. But this, it seems, was not the case. These 
letters had been preserved by the Chancellor's 
wife in a locked casket, which was not opened at 
the time of her death. A year ago they were 
found, and last May were given to the public. The 
collection is thoroughly enjoyable, the quantity 
(a little over a hundred pages in all) being just 
enough to give the flavor of the larger collection 
without the sense of weariness produced by con- 
templating the stout volumes of the, former series. 
The tone is naturally very intimate, often humorous 



or ironical. The breaking oflf of negotiations with 
Favre in September of 1870 because the French 
" still get the gripes so severely about Alsace," or 
the remark in a postscript, " Birthday of the King 
of Bavaria and I without my decorations," are ex- 
amples in point. The Chancellor's attitude on the 
siege of Paris and the bombardment of the forts 
is very sharply stated. A very interesting, almost 
pathetic, letter is the one describing the interview 
with Napoleon after Sedan. From another point 
of view the postscript on January 9, 1871, is inter- 
esting : " Read Psalm 27 yesterday in bed and fell 
asleep comforted with verse 14." The thought of 
trust in God is a dominant note throughout the let- 
ters, though his confidence that the " Lord will not 
intervene " in behalf of France is apt to provoke a 
smile. The translation here presented was made 
by Arnim Harder and is generally idiomatic and 
satisfactory, though an occasional phrase as " re- 
mained on the field" hardly gives the thought of 
the original. The volume has also an interesting 
introduction by Mr. Walter Littlefield. The ab- 
sence of any index is to be regretted. 

A Southern I" Pfof essor Thomas Cary Johnson's 
soldier, educator, " Life and Letters of Robert Lewis 
andtheoivgian. Dabney " (Presbyterian Committee 
of Publication, Richmond, Va.), we have a full ac- 
count of the long and useful career of an eminent 
Southern educator and theologian. The name 
Dabney (d'Aubignd) indicates good Huguenot an- 
cestry, and the Virginia family appears to have 
upheld the honored traditions of its origin. Edu- 
cated at the University of Virginia, Dr. Dabney 
was called to the chair of church history and polity 
at Union Theological Seminary, Hampden-Sidney, 
Va., and in later life to that of moral and mental 
philosophy at the University of Texas. He served 
in the Confederate army, four months as chaplain, 
and then, after two days devoted to Halleck's 
" Articles of War," four months as chief of staff to 
Stonewall Jackson, whose biography he afterward 
wrote. He was a zealous preacher as well as teacher. 
Uncompromising in his adherence to the old school 
of Southern Presbyterianism, he opposed all move- 
ments for uniting with the Northern section of that 
church, and was equally hostile toward the proposed 
Pan-Presbyterian Alliance. Professor Johnson's 
book is, from cover to cover, a glowing eulogy, and 
cannot fail to please the relatives and friends of the 
deceased. Frequent extracts from Dr. Dabney's 
writings, both prose and verse, are given, as well as 
two portraits of him and several views of college 
buildings. Of his surviving children the best-known 
is President Charles W. Dabney of the University 
of Tennessee.

us through plaster and bronze casts to be found in 
most of our galleries and art schools. A study of 
these sculptures trains the faculty for observation, 
and cultivates a taste for pleasing forms and a power 
of seeing the ideal in the actual. It is to assist in 
such a study, chiefly among the young, that Miss 
Helen Edith Legge has provided " A Short History 
of the Ancient Greek Sculptors" (James Pott & 
Co.), wherein is traced the development of the 
sculptor's art from the time of the wooden images 
of the gods attributed by tradition to Daedalus, 
Dipoeaus, and Scyllis, down to the time of Pheidias 
in the fifth century, B. C, when Greek art reached 
its zenith. The author's account of the sculptors 
is not only illustrated with admirable pictures of 
some of the more notable of their surviving works, 
but also by comments upon their art, stimulating a 
study of their scope and meaning. Although evi- 
dently intended for youthful readers, and avoid- 
ing all technical language, the book is valuable for 
more advanced art students, and might be found 
useful as a book of ready reference by all stu- 
dents of Greek art. Professor Percy Gardner, 
of Oxford, furnishes a few pages of introduction, 
which are like most introductions to books of this 
character — unnecessary. 



The phUosophy 
of road mending. 



The eleventh impression of Michael 
Fairless's "The Roadmender" comes 
from Messrs. E. P. Button & Co., in 
an ornate but inartistic binding, and with several 
quaint illustrations that emphasize in rather crude 
fashion the symbolism of the text. The sketches 
set forth the claim of roadmending, literal and 
figurative, to be the ideal means of earning a liveli- 
hood, at least for the " vagrant child of nature." 
Their philosophy is contentment with the simple 
life, joy in service and in the free gifts of the great 
outdoor world, and sympathetic relations with one's 
fellows, brute and human. There is nothing icono- 
clastic or recondite about the author's view of life, 
but his breadth of sympathy that enables him to 
turn quickly and eagerly from one interest to 
another, his steadfast courage and sweetness of 
spirit, and his simple, unaffected style of writing, 
account easily for the popularity of the book. Its 
title is taken from that of the first sketch. The 
other two, "Out of the Shadow" and "At the 
White Gate," tell how the Roadmender clung to 
his philosophy in the face of illness and death ; 
and how, forced to leave the "lonely companion- 
ship " of the road and its denizens, he found new 
interests in a London hospital, and great joy, a 
little later, in coming back, even as a helpless on- 
looker, to the road with its sunny, flower-girt 
meadows and its White Gate, symbol to him of the 
entrance into another world. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Vanity Fair," in three volumes, inaugurates the 
new " Kensington " Thackeray, published by subscrip- 
tion by the Messrs. Scribner. There are to be thirty- 
two volumes, printed from new plates made by Mr. 
De Vinne, and abundantly illustrated, both with the 
original drawings and with additional portraits and 
views. The volumes will appear at the rate of three 
every month. This is evidently to be an edition of 
Thackeray pure and simple, without impertinent edi- 
torial matter, and the execution of the work is such as 
to deserve the highest praise. In their general form 
the volumes approach closely to the model set by the 
publishers in their recent edition of TourgudniefE. 

More than forty years ago, the late George Cruik- 
shank made a series of drawings on wood for the illus- 
tration of " The Pilgrim's Progress." These drawings, 
left in the possession of Mr. Edwin Truman, a friend 
of the artist, have remained unpublished up to the 
present time, when they have afforded the Oxford 
University Press an excellent pretext for a new edition 
of Bunyan's allegory. This edition is a sumptuous affair, 
beautifully printed in old-fashioned typography on 
handmade paper, and limited to a thousand copies. Of 
the illustrations themselves little can be said that is 
good. With a few exceptions, they are trivial and 
carelessly drawn, and by no means represent the genius 
of the artist. We are not surprised that they should 
have lain in a portfolio all these years. 

A pretty pocket edition of Holbein's " Dance of 
Death," with a prefatory note by Mr. Austin Dobson, is 
published by the Scott-Thaw Co. The designs are 
printed direct from the blocks originally engraved by 
Messrs. Bonner and John Byfield for Douce's edition of 
1833, — the best imitations on wood, according to Mr. 
Linton. Thus being reproduced in the same medium as 
the originals (though the latter were cut and not en- 
graved), they have an interest not found in the usual 
photographic reproductions. The book is printed 
on Japanese paper, and issued in a limited edition. 

Shakespeare, in three volumes, and Keats, in one, are 
now added to the select company of Mr. Henry Frowde's 
" Oxford Miniature Poets." We are glad to have them 
both in this exquisite setting, and the Shakespeare espe- 
cially is a real boon. The tragedies are in one volume, 
the comedies in another, the histories, poems, and son- 
nets in the third. Mr. W. J. Craig is responsible for 
the text and for a glossary in each volume. There are 
many " pocket " editions of Shakespeare to be had, but 
for real compactness, convenience, and perfection in 
printing none can compare with this. 

Mr. Lionel Strachey has added another to his trans- 
lations from the French, choosing this time the memoirs 
of Madame Le Brun. His rendering, which is fluent 
and readable, is less literal than the anonymous version 
of 1879 ; but it hardly appears that anything has been 
gained by this freedom of treatment. The thirty-five 
letters, or chapters, as he calls them, have been 
regrouped into eighteen, with excisions to bring the 
work into uniformity with the translator's versions of 
the Countess Potocka's memoirs and the " Memoirs of 
a Contemporary." Three distinguishing features which 
go far toward justifying this new translation are the 
thirty-two reproductions from Mme. Le Brun's por- 
traits of eminent persons, the chronological list of her 
paintings, and the index. (Doubleday, Page & Co.)

Notes. 



Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co. send us a treatise 
on "Bridge Tactics," by Mr. R. F. Foster, the well- 
known whist specialist. 

The Messrs. Putnam publish a charmingly-printed 
edition of " The Odes of Anacreon," in Moore's para- 
phrase, with a series of illustrations designed by M. 
Girodet de Roussy. 

" A Little Tragedy at Tien-Tsin, and Other Stories 
from Elsewhere," by Miss Frances Aymar Mathews, 
author of " My Lady Peggy Goes to Town," will appear 
shortly from the press of Mr. Robert Grier Cooke. 

It is understood that Professor N. S. Shaler, of Har- 
vard University, is completing a new book, upon which 
he has been engaged for some time, entitled " The 
Citizen," being a study of the Individual and the 
Government. 

Mr. Daniel Munro Wilson's interesting volume enti- 
tled " Where American Independence Began " is issued 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in a second edition, 
containing considerable new matter and a number of 
additional illustrations. 

Two new volumes in the " Temple Bible " comprise 
" Tobit and the Babylonian Apocryphal Writings," ed- 
ited by Professor A. H. Sayce, and " Wisdom and the 
Jewish Apocryphal Writings," edited by Mr. W. B. 
Stevenson. The Messrs. Lippincott are the American 
publishers of this series. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., publish in a single 
volume "The Poetical Works of John Townsend 
Trowbridge," thus doing belated justice to one who has 
been for half a century past one of the most popular 
American writers of verse. A fine portrait of the 
venerable author serves as a frontispiece. 

"Months and Moods" is the title of a fifteen-year 
(1901-1915) calendar, "versified and diversified" by 
Mr. Edward Curtis, and published by the Grafton 
Press. The verses are original poems on the seasons, 
the work of Mr. Curtis, and the whole calendar is a 
substantially-bound book, which it had to be to promise 
fifteen years of use. 

A standard edition of the complete works of Ben 
Jonson, comprising probably nine octavo volumes, is to 
be published by the Oxford University Press. The 
Delegates of the Press have secured the cooperation of 
Prof. C. H. Herford and of Mr. Percy Simpson, who 
have been engaged for ten years or more on a critical 
examination of Jonson's text. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. will publish this 
spring a comprehensive and timely book by Prof, 
liicholas Paine Gilman on " Methods of Industrial 
Peace." The subjects dealt with are Trade-Unionism, 
Employers' Associations, Collective Bargaining, Labor 
Disputes, and the various forms of Conciliation and 
Arbitration practiced in the United States, England, 
Australia, and New Zealand. 

Some of the earliest announcements in the field of 
spring fiction come from Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., 
who have in press for March publication two novels of 
more than usual interest. One of these, the work of 
Mr. Randall Parrish, centres about the dramatic events 
at Fort Dearborn in 1812 ; the other deals with the 
picturesque figure of Robert Cavelier de la Salle, and 
is written by Mr. William Dana Orcutt. Both volumes 
will be elaborately illustrated in color. 



"The Book Monthly," aptly described as "a pic- 
tured and picturesque who's who and what's what of 
bookland," is the latest venture in English literary 
journalism. It has no concern with criticism, but is 
not the less useful and interesting on that account to 
all who have to do with books. American readers will 
do well to make its acquaintance. 

Mr. Thomas Hardy's historical drama, " The 
Dynasts," will be published at once by the Macmillan 
Co. Though complete in itself, it is designed ulti- 
mately to form one of a trilogy, of which the second 
play or part will cover the zenith of Napoleon's power, 
and the third his decline and fall, with the restoration 
to equilibrium of the old dynasties. 

M. Auguste Fournier's biography of " Napoleon the 
First," translated by Mrs. Margaret Bacon Corwin and 
Mr. Arthur Dart Bissell, and edited by Professor 
Edward Gaylord Bourne, is a recent publication of 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It is one of the best of the 
single-volume biographies, and its value is greatly 
enhanced by the exhaustive bibliography which is ap- 
pended. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. have completed ar- 
rangements for the publication in England of Mr. 
Clement's " Handbook of Modern Japan," which has 
proved so timely a book in view of events in the Orient. 
This work is planned to give in the most convenient 
form the information most likely to be sought for by 
those who wish to know and understand the status and 
development of Modern Japan. 

M. Emile Michel's great work on "Rembrandt: His 
Life, his Work, and his Time " is reissued in a third 
edition, imported by the Messrs. Scribner coincidently 
with the author's visit to this country. It is, as before, 
translated by Miss Florence Simmonds and edited by 
Mr. Frederick Wedmore. There are no less than three 
hundred and twenty-six illustrations satisfactorily re- 
produced. This work has been standard for its subject 
smce its original publication six years ago. 

Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee has compiled " A Canadian 
Bibliography for the Year 1901," which is now reprinted 
from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 
and published in pamphlet form by Messrs. James 
Hope & Son, Ottawa. The work includes contributions 
to periodicals as well as larger works, and is carefully 
indexed. We note no less than thirty- five entries under 
the name of Goldwin Smith, which may serve as an in- 
dication of the thoroughness of Mr. Burpee's work. 

An attempt at an exhaustive bibliography of books 
and periodical articles on United States history pub- 
lished during the year 1902, together with some con- 
tributions towards bibliography of writings on other 
parts of the Americas for the same year, prepared by 
Messrs. Ernest Cushing Richardson and Anson Ely 
Morse, is announced for early publication by Mr. C. 
Martins, Library Bookstore, Princeton, N. J. The 
work will contain more than one thousand titles of 
books and pamphlets and over five thousand titles of 
periodical articles. It is planned to issue similar 
annual volumes regularly in the future. 

Messrs. Methuen & Co. have in preparation, under 
the direction of Mr. Sidney Lee, a new collection of 
classical literature on a plan which does not seem to 
have been already attempted in a systematic way either 
in England or in this country. They propose to issue 
under the title of " Methuen's Universal Library " at a 
very low price and at very short regular intervals a

[Feb.!], 



carefully printed series of books of classical repute, 
comprising not only accessible works, but also some 
rarer volumes of which no cheap editions exist. It is 
hoped that the Library may bring in due time all the 
best literature of England and other nations within the 
reach of every class of readers. Special efforts will be 
made to render textual accuracy as notable a charac- 
teristic of the new venture as cheapness, completeness, 
and typographical clearness. The text of each work, 
which will be unabridged, will be prepared from the 
best sources by competent scholars, and the works of 
many of the great masters of poetry, drama, fiction, 
belles lettres, history, and biography are now in the 
press. In the case of the more eminent authors their 
complete works will be supplied in two or more vol- 
umes, but any single masterpiece will be produced sep- 
arately. General editorial comment will be excluded, 
but each volume will open with a brief biographical and 
bibliographical note by Mr. Sidney Lee, who will be the 
general editor of this Library. 



A NOTED LIBRARY WORKER. 

News has just been received of the death of Dr. 
Otto Hartwig, formerly Director of the University 
Library of Halle, A. S., and until recently editor of 
" Centralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen." Born in 1830, 
Dr. Hartwig studied theology and philology and was 
pastor of the German congregation in Messina, Sicily, 
from 1860 to 1865. After a short career as teacher 
he entered the service of the university library of Mar- 
burg in 1867, remaining there until 1874 when he ac- 
cepted a position in the university library of Halle. 
In 1876 he was promoted to chief librarian at Halle. 
Here he met with conditions that taxed to the ut- 
most his administrative talent. The library was defi- 
cient in many important branches of learning, the 
reclassification and recataloguing of the library was an 
important desideratum, and a new building urgently 
needed. All these problems he attacked with vigor and 
care. The new building was completed and the books 
removed to it in 1880, and eight years later the recata- 
loguing and reclassification were finished. In 1898 an 
'affection of the eyes caused him to ask for six months' 
leave of absence, and in December of the same year 
his resignation was offered and accepted. Shortly be- 
fore he had been appointed a member of the " Kura- 
torium'* of the university library of Berlin. Since 
retiring from active work he has resided in Marburg, 
and here he died on December 22, 1903. In 1884 the 
first number of " Centralblatt fiir Bibliothekswesen " 
appeared, with Dr. Hartwig and Dr. K. Schulz, libra- 
rian of the Imperial supreme court in Leipzig, as edit- 
ors. Since 1886 Dr. Hartwig has been the sole 
responsible editor, only relinquishing the work with the 
December number of last year. As editor of the 
« Centralblatt " Dr. Hartwig exercised a very distinct 
influence on library progress in Germany. His con- 
tributions on library matters to his own journal and 
others were not numerous, but always of importance. 
A question in which he took particular interest was that 
of inter-library loan of manuscripts, and he contributed 
a paper on this subject to the World's Congress of 
Librarians in Chicago in 1893. A list of his inde- 
pendent publications in other fields shows a wide range 
of studies and literary interests. In 1900 his auto- 
biography, "Aus dem Leben eines altes deutschen 
Bibliothekars. I., Lehr- und Wanderjahre," was issued 
for distribution among friends. A. a. S. J.

Four Admirable Books 

For the Class in English 

Ac. McCLURG «fe CO., the publishers, beg to ask 
• the attention of instructors to four useful and 
important volumes, prepared by Sherwin Cody, 
which fill a significant place in the development of 
the short story and the English essay, and in the 
consideration of Poe's vrritings. 

The volumes are: "A Selection from the 
World's Greatest Short Stories," "A Selection 
from the Best English Essays," <<The Best 
Tales of Edgar Allan Poe," "The Best Poems 
and Essays of Edgar Allan Poe," each volume 
with introductions, analyses, and criticisms. 

The two volumes first published have now found 
their way into many universities, colleges, and 
schools. Each occupies a quite important field, 
and has received unstinted approval from educators 
who have had an opportunity to test them in actual 
class work. These books may be taken up inde- 
pendently of other text-books, and yet in conjunc- 
tion with them, and may be put to use practically 
at any time during the year. 

We invite inquiries concerning the adoption [of 
these books, and shall be glad to send a synopsis of 
each, together with a list of institutions which have 
thus far made adoptions, on request.

A FEW OF SCRIBNER'S FEBRUARY BOOKS 



Now Ready : 

NEW LIGHT ON THE LIFE OF JESUS 

By CHAELES A. BRIGGS, D.D. 12mo, $1.20 net (postage 11 cents). 
In this volume Doctor Briggs sets forth a new order of the events and teaching in the life of Jesus, in the light of 
which a large proportion of the disputes as to the harmony of the Gospels disappear. The result is revolutionary so 
far as modem opinions are concerned ; but actually the results are conservative, being in the main a return to ancient 
opinions. The composition of the various Gospels also become much easier of explanation, and the entire subject 
acquires new results. The book is not technical, and it has been so written as to make it useful and interesting to 
all intelligent persons. 

A New Volume of THE LIBRARY OF ART 

FRENCH PAINTING IN THE XVI. CENTURY 

By L. DIMIER. With forty illustrations, including photographs of rare and almost unknown paintings in French 

Chateaux not heretofore reproduced. $2.00 net. 

INTRODUCTION TO CLASSICAL LATIN LITERATURE 

By Professor WILLIAM CRANSTON LAWTON, author of "Introduction to Classical Greek Literature." 

Illustrated, $1.20 net. 

Nearly Ready: 

KOREA 

By ANGUS HAMILTON. With a newly prepared map and many illustrations. $4.00 net. 
A special interest attaches to this full and up-to-date description of Korea and its people by reason of the present 
international situation. The author was for two years the special correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette in the Far 
East, and during his commission for that journal travelled throughout Korea, visiting the spheres of influence of the 
powers, treaty ports and concessions, and the country generally. The important facts of the present international 
complications are here prominently dealt with, as well as the more general facts of the country, its history, arts, 
customs, scenery, and the like. The accompanying map must be regarded as of great importance just now. 

LITERARY LIVES SERIES 

Edited by ROBERTSON NICOLL, LL.D. Each with photogravure frontispiece and sixteen illustrations. 

$1.00 net (postage 12 cents). 
This series is intended to furnish biographical and critical studies of well-known authors of all countries. Distin- 
guished writers, British and American, wUl contribute to the series. While much freedom has been allowed the 
contributors, it will be found that the aim of supplying full critical and expository estimates has been kept steadily 
in view. In many cases additions have been made to the store of existing information, and it is hoped that the books 
should take a place, not only for their biographical value, but as helpful companions and interpreters in the study 
of literary masterpieces.

THE SA VING GRAC E OF HUMOR. 

When Shelley, deserting wife and child, 
and running away with Mary Godwin, wrote 
back to Harriet inviting her to come and join 
them, he showed a lack of humor. So amaz- 
ing is the effrontery of the letter that, with no 
further knowledge of its writer, one would be 
tempted to believe him indulging in a hideous 
joke, and so not destitute of a certain sugges- 
tion of humor, after all. His defect is so 
pronounced that it approaches the point where 
extremes meet and the serious passes over into 
the facetious. How difficult not to imagine 
him laughing in his sleeve when he says : " I 
write to show that I do not forget you ; I write 
to urge you to come to Switzerland, where you 
will find one firm and constant friend to whom 
your interests will be always dear — by whom 
your feelings will never wilfully be injured." 
Could malice itself have devised anything to 
surpass this? When the artist-poet Blake 
proposed to his young wife the taking to his 
bosom of an additional partner — perhaps 
thinking thus to provide her with a pleasant 
companion, and possibly, with his patriarchal 
notions, expecting her to emulate the biblical 
example of Sarah — he disclosed to her indig- 
nant and astonished gaze a gaping void where 
the sense of humor should have been. 

The big and muscular glutton who devours 
a weak and defenseless brother, and then, 
with a sanctimonious folding of the hands 
over his distended stomach, attributes the 
satisfying of his appetite to the inscrutable 
workings of manifest destiny, has by over-feed- 
ing dulled his sense of humor. The tyrant 
fights shy of the satirist. Napoleon was un- 
friendly to men of wit and humor. To quote 
Thackeray's familiar definition, humor is a 
mixture of love and wit. Being of the nature 
of love, it does not behave itself unseemly. It 
is kindly affectioned. It is of the nature of 
sweet reasonableness. Its generous inclusive- 
ness admits the recognition of contrary claims. 
In fact, the very breath of its life is this per- 
ception of conflicting truths, of incongruities, 
of paradoxes. Seeing both sides of a question 
at once, it is a foe to all narrowness, unfair-

ness, selfishness, arrogance, cruelty. Can one 
conceive of a genuine humorist as unkind ? 
" The perception of the comic," as Emerson 
has well said, " is a tie of sympathy with other 
men, a pledge of sanity, and a protection from 
those perverse tendencies and gloomy insan- 
ities in which fine intellects sometimes lose 
themselves. A rogue alive to the ludicrous 
is still convertible. If that sense is lost, his 
fellow-men can do little for him." 

A sense of humor, then, saves a man from 
the enemy in his own bosom. It warns him 
not to take himself too seriously. A large 
part of Wordsworth's output of verse would 
have remained unpublished, unwritten, not so 
much as conceived, had humor been one of the 
poet's gifts. Milton's controversial pamphlets 
show attempts at humor that make the judi- 
cious grieve. A true sense of the humorous 
would have spared his admirers this pain. 
His fun reminds one of Plutarch's description 
of a piece of fooling laboriously evolved from 
the brain of Hegesias of Magnesia, — "a 
ponderous joke, dull enough to have put out 
the fire." Excessive enthusiasm and mis- 
applied zeal are wholesomely curbed by a 
quick perception of the ludicrous. To draw 
upon Emerson once more, we encounter in one 
of his essays a physician who, in reply to 
an anxious inquiry concerning a patient, ex- 
claimed with professional joy sparkling in his 
eyes : " Oh, I saw him this morning ; it is the 
most correct apoplexy I have ever seen : face 
and hands livid, breathing stertorious, all the 
symptoms perfect ! " A case so bea\itifully 
in harmony with the books was too much for 
the medical man's humanity. The venerable 
Dr. Samuel Hopkins of Newport once elicited 
a charmingly simple reply from a parishioner, 
whose matter-of-fact habit of mind must have 
betrayed him into countless similar blunders. 
The thoughtful pastor had offered to bring 
some of his recent sermons and read them to 
this member of his flock, who had for several 
Sundays been kept from church by illness. 
" Do so," was the cordial rejoinder, " for I 
have had no sleep since this attack began." 

Many a failure, the result of attempting the 
absurdly impossible, would have been prevented 
had zeal been tempered with humor. Unfor- 
tunate enterprises of this nature, unaccom- 
panied with any sense of humor in the actors, 
often excite this feeling most irresistibly in the 
spectators. For, to quote a pregnant utterance 
from " The Gentle Reader," " the atmospheric 
currents of merriment move irresistibly toward 



a vacuum. Create a character altogether des- 
titute of humor and the most sluggish intelli- 
gence is stirred in the effort to fill the void." 
Thus there is something at once pathetic and 
humorous in the fond attempt of Charlemagne 
to make his mushroom state emulate, in the 
arts as well as in polity, the mature empire 
that had been the growth of a thousand years. 
No wonder his ill-cemented structure fell to 
pieces of its own weight before it reached the 
hands of his grandchildren. His second Rome 
(Aix-la-Chapelle), with its extemporized forum 
and its senate of half-civilized Franks, and 
with its pretentious but uncouth buildings that 
rudely aped the architecture of Ravenna, may 
well excite a smile of pity. The very words 
of his biographer and inseparable companion 
seem to invite disaster. " The second Rome 
lifts herself," he proudly declares, " in new, 
unwonted bloom, with massive buildings whose 
lofty domes touch the stars. The godly Charles 
stands far from his palace, selecting the vari- 
ous sites, and fixes in their order the high 
walls of the future Rome." A further touch 
of that humor that is so closely akin to pathos 
is felt by the observer as he watches the monk- 
ish Eginhard apply himself to the study of 
Vitruvius. The buildings that came of this 
study would have struck the architect of Au- 
gustus with amaze. 

It has been usual to class women among the 
unfortunates born without sense of humor. 
Exceptions will readily come to mind. The 
creator of Mrs. Poyser and Tommy Trounsom 
and Wiry Ben was certainly not blind to the 
humorous aspects of human nature. But the 
peculiarly feminine, das ewig Weibliche,, we do 
not associate with a keen appreciation of the 
incongruous. The ardent suitor who is as- 
sured by the object of his passion that, though 
she can never be his wife, she will always be 
a sister to him, distinctly feels in the offered 
substitute the presence of a certain something 
quite different from that admirable blend of 
love and wit whereof humor is composed. The 
fascinating coquette, to whom man's attentions 
are more than meat and drink, and whose sig- 
nals of distress when he withholds his devotion 
hardly ever fail to bring him to his knees, 
shows a defective grasp of the situation in its 
logical implications. Hence the pained sur- 
prise and the injured innocence affected by 
her the moment she is honored with the treat- 
ment accorded to a reasonable being and is 
expected to harmonize inward purpose with 
outward seeming. This not un amiable weak-

ness, the sure index of a conspicuous lack of 
humor, the older novelists were fond of exhib- 
iting in its coarser manifestations, and it will 
ever remain a useful property to the construc- 
tor of love stories. Woman is proverbially 
cruel to woman. Nor is her heartlessness 
always confined to this traditional severity 
toward the foibles of her own sex. In " The 
People of the Abyss " we have recently been 
told that the sufferings of the London poor, as 
the destitute wretches exhibit themselves in the 
public parks, excite amusement oftener than 
pity in the passing women, especially the young 
women, of the well-to-do classes. Walter Pater, 
in his essay on Lamb, regards humor as an 
amalgam of pity with mirth. Thus viewing 
its composition, we may safely conclude that 
where pitilessness displays itself there will be 
found no keen perception of the humorous 
factors of our existence. Let it be added, how- 
ever, for the consolation of the many excellent 
women who are deficient in this sense — though 
they never will admit the deficiency — that 
they are not without good company. The 
singleness of purpose characteristic of heroes 
and martyrs is, from its very nature, incom- 
patible with a lively appreciation of incongrui- 
ties. With the sense of humor too insistently 
acute, the river of life seems somehow to be 
split into channels so minute that it loses itself 
in the sand ; there is no steady current of seri- 
ous thought and purpose. The typical reformer 
is terribly in earnest. Horace Mann planted 
himself one day, tall and tragic, before Haw- 
thorne, and, fired with anti-tobacco zeal, deliv- 
ered himself of his opinion of a brother-in-law 
who could so far deviate from the path of 
rectitude as to smoke. " Do I understand you 
to say, Mr. Hawthorne, that you actually use 
tobacco? " he inquired severely. "Yes, I smoke 
a cigar once in a while," was the good-natured 
reply. " Then, Mr. Hawthorne, it is my duty 
to tell you that I no longer have the same re- 
spect for you that I have had." Therewith the 
self-appointed censor turned and strode from 
the room. It is easy enough to say, with Haw- 
thorne's son, that Horace Mann was wholly 
destitute of humor. But it is more than prob- 
able that the excellent man himself would have 
stoutly denied the charge; and perhaps in 
matters less deeply moving his feelings he was 
not without a perception of the ludicrous. Who 
of us is never blind to the comic in things that 
affect our dearest interests ? Angry denial will 
stamp one immediately as sadly defective in 
humor, just as hot resentment at the charge of 



insanity is pretty good evidence of an unbal- 
anced mind. Perhaps there is no better mark 
of a plentiful endowment of humor than the 
ability to wear a smiling face when in deepest 
earnest. The child, with his sense of humor 
still in embryo, cannot do this. 

Not without reason did Cicero liken a jest- 
book to a salt-pit. Humor is the salt that keeps 
the temper sweet, the saving element that pre- 
vents sentiment and religion from degenerating 
into maudlin emotionalism, and an ever-neces- 
sary accompaniment to all unconstrained social 
intercourse. As man is the only being at once 
conscious of the miseries of life and able to 
laugh at them, so this peculiarly human quality 
is found in anything like perfection only among 
the most highly civilized. Savages have it not, 
or only in a form that savors more of cruelty 
than of kindness. Both the too sentimental and 
the too practical want it. It would seem to be 
the arch enemy of excess in any direction. Nil 
in extremis is its motto. Its presence indicates 
a normal and healthy state of tension between 
the upbuilding and the down-pulling forces 
whose interaction is life. It is a potent aid in 
the discharge of physical as well as mental 
functions, ^sculapius is said to have written 
comic songs to quicken the circulation in his 
patients. A London physician prescribed 
" Peregrine Pickle " for certain complaints. 
Sustained by his unconquerable merriness of 
humor, Charles Lamb bravely bore a life-long 
anxiety. 

A sane enjoyment of the countless paradoxes 
and ironies of life is of the essence of the high- 
est wisdom. Without such enjoyment these 
numberless incongruities will annoy and de- 
press. The ardor of hero-worship will be chilled 
when the worshipper discovers how few human 
lives fail to reveal a seamy side upon closer 
scrutiny. The world's progress owes much to 
great men whose characters do not square with 
their deeds. Many a good cause has prevailed 
by questionable means. There is no system of 
philosophy but encounters stubborn facts that 
sadly mar its symmetry. Vice fares sumptu- 
ously and goes arrayed in purple and fine linen, 
while virtue starves and clothes herself in rags. 
Rewards and punishments appear to be as- 
signed by chance. Next to the sublimity 
of a blind faith, there is nothing equal to an 
abiding sense of the humor of it all to save one 
from pessimism. Without this neither life nor 
that literature which aims to be the faithful 
transcript of life can be rightly enjoyed.

Some Impressions of Whistler.* 



Mr. Arthur Jerome Eddy's " Recollections 
and Impressions of Whistler " is the sort of 
book for which Whistler's unique personality 
and sparkling wit provided such tempting and 
abundant material. Its method is haphazard, 
its preparation too evidently hasty ; in critical 
acumen it is unfortunately lacking. But a 
large body of readers will no doubt prefer it 
to a more formal and studied biography, for 
the reason that it is not burdened with the 
details of the artist's career nor with fine-spun 
distinctions about his genius, but merely pre- 
sents his very attractive individuality in the 
form of countless witty anecdotes and amusing 
odds and ends of comment and reminiscence, 
while its information about his pictures is of a 
useful sort. The book is well printed, suit- 
ably bound in boards of a shade of Whistler's 
favorite brown, and illustrated with excellent 
reproductions in photogravure of eleven of the 
artist's works. The familiar portrait by Rajon 
forms the frontispiece. Thus mechanical beauty 
and the very great charm of the subject atone 
in large measure for the faults of authorship; 
and many admirers of Whistler will wish to 
add the book to their libraries. 

These should not expect, however, to find 
much that is new to them in Mr. Eddy's 
memoir. He does, to be sure, explain in the 
preface that his " reminiscences are mostly 
personal," that many of the anecdotes were had 
from the artist's own lips, and that the views 
concerning his art were formed from watching 
him at work day by day, and after many inter- 
views, in which, occasionally at least, he broke 
his habitual reticence to talk of the one thing 
in which he took a serious interest. These 
statements are unquestionably true (although 
no details of the personal relationship are 
given), but we could never have guessed it 
from what follows. A large number of the 
stories are easily recognizable and duly acknowl- 
edged as from current periodicals and news- 
papers. The others might have been picked 
up in the ateliers of Paris and London, but 
most of them might also have been obtained 
with less expenditure of effort from a clipping 
bureau. None of them imply intimacy or even

delphia : J. 6. Lippincott Co. 



acquaintance with Whistler. This is no fault 
of Mr. Eddy's. The truth is, the penny-a- 
liners have long appreciated Whistler's literary 
value, recognizing his claim to be master-artist 
in words if not in nocturnes; and they have 
circulated his bon-mots and his eccentricities 
industriously through their columns. The 
exceeding sharpness of Whistler's wit, and his 
habit of letting his best shafts fly more than 
once, contributed to making his witticisms 
common property. And so, after last sum- 
mer's flood of post-mortem paragraphs, even 
an intimate of Whistler's — if he had any — 
must expect to find himself anticipated along 
anecdotal lines. But if Mr. Eddy's stories are 
not for the most part new, they are both well 
selected and well told, and it is much to have 
so large a body of them preserved in so 
attractive a volume. 

Among the letters which Mr. Eddy quotes, 
and which we do not remember seeing else- 
where, is one written in Whistler's crispest 
epistolary style, and illustrating, besides, his 
well-known disinclination to promptness. An 
ojSicial connected with an international exhibit 
sent notes to various artists in Paris, announc- 
ing his intended visit to the city and making 
appointments with them at his hotel. Whist- 
ler's hour was fixed at " 4.30 precisely." The 
artist answered thus : 

" Dear Sir: — I have received your letter announcing 
that you will arrive in Paris on the -th. I congratulate 
you. I never have been able, and never shalL be able, 
to be anywhere at «4.30 precisely.' 

" Yours most faithfully, 

J. McN. Whistler." 

The same aptness in making what one of 
the Enemies of " The Gentle Art " has styled 
" very unbecoming and improper " answers, is 
shown in the artist's retort to an excited Cock- 
ney gentleman who rushed into a shop where 
Whistler was trying on a hat, and mistaking 
him for a salesman cried : " I say, this 'at 
doesn't fit." Eyeing him critically a moment 
Whistler said : " Neither does your coat." 

His own immaculate attire was proverbial. 
So were the dapper silk hat, the yellow gloves, 
the slender walking-stick, the monocle, the 
curled mustache, the be-ribboned white fore- 
lock, "famous as the plume of Navarre." 
Somebody once gave Whistler an American 
umbrella of the sort that furls very tightly. 
He used it as a cane, and his delight in it 
knew no bounds. On one occasion, according 
to Mr. Eddy, Whistler was coming out of his 
studio with a friend, and as they made their

way to a nearby cab-stand, it began to drizzle. 
His friend, who had no umbrella, said : " Hurry 
and put up your umbrella or we '11 get our hats 
wet." Whistler fumbled for a second at the 
umbrella, then hurried on. " But I would get 
my umbrella wet," he said. 

So much for the " Reminiscences " — for it 
is unfair to steal more of Mr. Eddy's stories; 
and the biographical data, being from casual 
sources and intended only as a connecting 
thread on which to hang the anecdotes and the 
estimates of the man and his work, need not 
delay us here. 

As an art critic Mr. Eddy's attitude is 
surely too much marked by undiscriminating 
enthusiasm to merit complete confidence ; but 
as an expositor of such matters as Whistler's 
title to be called a colorist, his attitude toward 
portraiture, or his theory of the suitable hang- 
ing of pictures, his work is clear and inter- 
esting — likely to be decidedly illuminating 
to the " plain man " of Whistler's own satire. 
Toward his subject's personality Mr. Eddy 
appears somewhat in the character of an apol- 
ogist. His sense of humor is not strong. Dis- 
liking flippancy however polished, he naturally 
wishes that the Master had been less ardent an 
*' Apostle of Persiflage " in his idle moments, 
less artistic a maker of enemies in his bitter 
ones. And it is possible that the nocturnes 
and symphonies would have been taken more 
seriously, or at least have received quicker rec- 
ognition, if the critics had not had the memory 
of the Butterfly's insinuating " reflections " 
to wipe out. It is also no doubt true that 
Whistler's egotism and affectation have been 
vastly exaggerated. From a painful sense of 
duty, then, the biographer should strive to 
put us into the more receptive attitude of 
the French, whose prompter appreciation of 
Whistler's genius Mr. Eddy refers in part 
to their inability to resent his untranslatable 
irony. Still, we find it hard to forgive Mr. 
Eddy's elaborate attempt to explain away the 
paradoxes of " The Ten O'clock Lecture," or 
his doubt about the advisability of reprinting 
the delicious impertinences of " The Gentle 
Art of Making Enemies." We prefer " the 
real Mr. Whistler," — who, instead of laying 
his habit of controversy to either his West 
Point training or his long and bitter struggle 
for recognition, frankly confessed to being " a 
bundle of nerves and dyspepsia." The fact 
that his personal motives often appear as vague 
and inscrutable as the outline of Battersea 
Bridge in the blue and silver nocturne, cannot 



reasonably affect our pleasure in the picture. 
But it does add to the charm of the man, and 
to our enjoyment of a book like Mr. Eddy's, 
much of whose point and vivacity depends on 
the fact that Whistler was to the last an insol- 
uble enigma. Edith Kellogg Ddnton. 



Russia as a Model..* 



Coming at just this time, when war clouds 
are thundering over the eastern shores of the 
Pacific, — a name seemingly destined to be- 
come a complete misnomer, — the book result- 
ing from the recent journey of Mr. Albert J. 
Beveridge, junior senator of the United States 
from Indiana, has unusual pertinence and will 
be read with assiduity by all who desire infor- 
mation regarding certain phases of an in- 
evitable struggle. It appears that the author 
has recently returned from a journey through 
Russia, Manchuria, and Corea ; but his volume 
is limited to a consideration of Asiatic Russia, 
with a portion of a single chapter referring to 
Japan. Nothing at all is said about Corea. The 
attitude throughout the book is so markedly 
pro-Russian that it deserves the stronger term 
of Slavophile. 

Senator Beveridge is an ardent worshipper 
at the shrine of the ancient ideals of pagan 
Rome revived in modern times under the title 
of imperialism. He is a devotee of might, and 
right is seldom considered in his work. Being 
enamored of " world power," he necessarily fell 
under the spell of a theocratic autocracy as 
the best engine for putting into practice these 
wholly un-American conceptions. In his treat- 
ment of the Russian administration he seems de- 
terminately to have put behind all conceptions 
of popular or free government ; and his faith 
in these conceptions is too small, apparently, to 
permit him to undertake any defense of de- 
mocracy against the frequent adverse criticisms 
quoted by him as passed upon its shortcomings 
by Russian officials. Especially does he lay 
stress on the possibility of rising into imperial 
power from the humbler walks of life, as in the 
case of the Russian minister of finance, Sergius 
Witte, ignoring the vastly greater difficulties 
attending such a feat in Russia as compared 
with this country. 

As a senator of the United States Mr. 
Beveridge was accorded every privilege by the 
Russian authorities in his journey across Asia.

He evidently expected that obstacles would be 
thrown in his way, especially in Manchuria. 
But the Russians were wise enough to secure 
his good will at the outset, and thereafter 
they must have felt that they could not lose it. 
They would certainly have been right in the 
supposition, for nothing could have alienated 
an affection given so whole-heartedly. A strik- 
ing instance of Mr. Beveridge's tenderness for 
Russia is shown in his account of the hideous 
massacre at Blagovestchensk in 1900. What 
he admits " may have been only a rumor " led 
the Russians in this town on recently-stolen 
territory to assume that a Chinese army was 
descending upon them, that the Chinese on 
their own territory across the river were arm- 
ing against them, that the Chinese in their own 
settlement were to join with their countrymen 
across the river, and that by a junction of these 
three forces Blagovestchensk would be im- 
perilled. Thereupon " the Chinese in the city 
itself were driven by the few Cossacks down 
to the river's edge below the town and forced 
into the river. Three or four thousand of them 
perished." It seems to have been after this 
wholesale massacre that the Chinese across 
the river began a futile bombardment of Blag- 
ovestchensk with muskets, — " you may now see 
the bullet-marks made in the home of the local 
governor. Many houses of Blagovestchensk 
still show these signs of actual peril." Then 
came the chief horror. Even Mr. Beveridge 
does not state the total slaughter, estimated at 
not less than fifteen thousand men, women, and 
children. But his humane conclusions are par- 
ticularly noteworthy. 

« Finally reinforcements arrived, the Russians crossed 
the river, and literally wiped the Chinese town off the 
face of the earth. You may visit its site now, but you 
will see nothing but waving grass and here and there 
the demolished remains of the crumbling wall of a 
house. Such, stripped of its many variations, is the story 
of the great < massacre ' of the Chinese by the Russians 
of Blagovestchensk in 1900 which made the world 
•shudder.' . . . 

« So much space has been given to this incident be- 
cause of the tremendous publicity given to it and the 
distortion of all of its features, and because, too, it is a 
very fair illustration of the manner in which any inci- 
dent of Russian advance is painted to the American and 
European world. When we hear of Russian outrages we 
must always bear in mind that while it may well be that 
all of their details are entirely true, yet the chances are 
that the forbidding aspects of each affair are magnified." 

Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant. 

This acceptance of the Russian point of view 
leads Mr. Beveridge to seeming endorsement 
of ideals not in the least American. He says, 
for example : 



" More than a score of different peoples are now 
under the colors of the Czar; and, say what we will 
from our western point of view, they appear to be as 
highly contented as the people of the more advanced 
countries, such as Germany or Italy [has the writer 
forgotten the German socialist, and the emigrating^ 
Italian peasant ?], and far more satisfied with their 
conditions than are the English." 

This places contentment among the desirable 
national qualities, and presents another phase 
of the constant confusion made throughout the 
book between " good " government and free 
government, generally to the disparagement 
of the latter. There is a stress laid on the 
virtues of efficient civil service sadly at vari- 
ance with the practices of our last two na- 
tional administrations. And there are some 
convincing arguments against the high tariffs 
of the same period, from the statement '■'■ the 
Russians are still buying in the best and cheap- 
est market, and the best and cheapest market 
is our own," through the account of the acerbi- 
ties arising between the Russian and American 
governments over the sugar duties, to the strong 
probability of the total loss to the United 
States of its Russian markets. 

Commercialism and imperialism go hand in 
hand, and the comments of several persona 
whom Mr. Beveridge interviewed, to the effect 
that " we don't know, and we don't care, wha 
governs the country," explain this in part. 
Still, there must be some Americans who will 
object to the implication behind the statement 
of the Indiana senator that "When American 
trade held the first place in the Orient, the 
American flag was seen in every port. It 
was a great advertisement then." And there 
is another fine suggestion for the future in 
this: 

« Another thing which the government might do, and 
which would have a beneficial effect upon American 
trade in China, is to keep in Chinese waters all but on& 
or two ships of our Pacific squadron. Moreover, the 
heaviest part of our navy should be kept in Asiatic 
waters. It is there that the conflicts of the future will 
occur, and it is there where our visible power should 
be manifest to all beholders." 

It is a pleasant thought that we are to make 
men and money unproductive by heavy taxa- 
tion for a navy, trying to make up the loss of 
a profitable home market consequent upon thia 
by seeking a doubtfully profitable foreign 
market, and then, for our pains, 

" Let the guU'd fool the toils of war pursue, 
Where bleed the many to enrich the few." 

But objections of this sort are what Mr. Bev- 
eridge refers to when he says that " England 
and America have been wasting time on 



1904.] 



THE DIAL

academic argumentations about unsubstantial 
theories." 

There are some inaccuracies in the book, 
due no doubt to haste in preparation. Of Mr. 
Beveridge's style something may be learned 
from the extracts here given. It abounds 
in repetitions, and is inflated throughout, 
apparently suffering from the vices which 
Herbert Spencer noted as inherent in dicta- 
tion. Among numerous similar lapses, Mr. 
Beveridge speaks of " witnessing cathedrals," 
of " vocalinity," and of one who " does not 
look like we are." And the book is without 
an index, an unpardonable omission in such a 
work. 

Having thus summed up, in good part, the 
faults of the book, both in regard to man- 
ner and matter, substance and form, it is 
to be said, on the other hand, that the very 
sympathy shown for Eussia has enabled Mr. 
Beveridge to present a picture of the empire 
and of its people unsurpassed in serious lit- 
erature for accuracy and comprehension. From 
the virtual chancellor of the empire to the most 
ignorant peasant, the Kussian is sketched with 
lines now broad, now narrow, until every phase 
of his none too complex nature has been sub- 
mitted to a sort of psychological dissection and 
laid bare to the enquiring mind. Not only is the 
government of the Czar analyzed and explained, 
but its methods in respect of Church and 
State as well, its educational aspirations, its 
interference between employer and employed 
to prevent the industrial horrors of western 
Europe and America, its firm conviction of its 
mission as a civilizing and christianizing power 
through the world, its aspirations toward a 
dominion over other peoples to be acquired by 
a combination of velvet glove and iron fist, 
its permanency of policy made possible by its 
autocracy, and, coming down to detail, the 
manner in which these circumstances are put 
into play in the occupation of Manchuria, and 
the ceaseless, resistless force with which the 
machinery moves on, slowly and surely enough 
to suggest the mills of the gods, all character- 
ized in a word by a youthful and enthusiastic 
officer when he said " Kussia the Inevitable." 

As regards the immediate future, and the 
issue of the war between the armies of the Mi- 
kado and the Czar, Senator Beveridge imparts 
a clear impression of the facts. It was unques- 
tionably to the interest of Russia to secure 
delay. Her single line of railway track will 
not suffice for the victualling of great military 
forces in eastern Asia, and her settlement of 



Manchuria is far too incomplete to permit any 
reliance upon the present resources of the 
country, fertile as it is. There appeared, from 
his statement, to be inherent weakness in the 
Kussian squadrons in the Pacific, making her 
control of water transportation from St. Peters- 
burg and Odessa to Vladivostok and Port 
Arthur more than doubtful, while the Black 
Sea squadron is tied up in those waters by the 
concert of Europe, and possible British hos- 
tility makes it inexpedient to use the naval ves- 
sels now in the Persian Gulf. Nor can it be 
said that the fortifications at Port Arthur and 
Dalni are in a condition entirely satisfactory 
for defence, while Vladivostok is ice-bound 
during no small portion of the year, and the 
transportation from that port to its southern 
sisters is also dependent upon a single line of 
rails. 

But if St. Petersburg desired delay, the 
reverse was true of Tokyo. Japan, maintaining 
her ancient birth-rate while introducing the 
practice of modern hygiene, is seriously over- 
populated now, and the strain upon her re- 
sources is a permanently growing one. Her 
statesmen are seeking an outlet for her throng- 
ing thousands as a necessity of national exist- 
ence. The treaty of Shimonoseki would have 
secured southern Manchuria for this purpose, 
had not Eussia, aided and abetted by Germany 
and France, forced from Japan the fruits of her 
victory in 1895. Baffled here, they have turned 
to Corea, under-populated and more fertile than 
Japan's own soil. But Eussia's interference 
in 1895 secured for the Czar the ports of Dalni 
and Port Arthur, and the railway connecting 
them with Vladivostok through the Manchurian 
road is an essential to their maintenance in the 
face of Japan's efficient naval force. Should 
Corea fall into Japanese hands, placing Japan 
within less than two hundred miles of this 
essential line of communication between Eus- 
sia's Pacific naval stations, a line representing 
her ambitions in Peking itself, the whole policy 
of the Eassian administration in eastern Asia 
is made of no avail. And it was clearly to 
Japan's interest to strike now, or submit for 
ever. 

In a word, this is the beginnmg of a 
struggle for life and death on the part of the 
Mikado's people, a struggle having for its 
grand prize the hegemony of the yellow race. 
On Eussia's part success seems to prophecy 
the eventual control of all Asia, Great Britain's 
Indian Empire with the rest, by the flat-capped 
administrators of autocracy. The entire civil-

ized world is profoundly implicated in the re- 
sult, and the recent embarkation of the United 
States in the doubtful role of a " world power " 
of physical rather than moral force has en- 
tangled the American people among others, 
exactly as Washington foresaw when he spoke 
the warning in his Farewell Address. And it 
may be added, though this is not within the 
purview of Senator Beveridge's book, that final 
success in this battle of giants is likely to rest, 
not with the largest battalions or the heaviest 
artillery, but with the financiers of Europe 
and America. If the Jew, having in mind the 
atrocities which excited the wrath of Tolstoy 
and of the world at large, should withhold 
his assistance from Kussia in the immediate 
future or place his coffers at the disposal of the 
Mikado, or should the newly-made millions of 
America step into the gap in the interests of 
commercial treaties which past experience has 
shown are likely to be granted more liberally by 
Japan than by Eussia, the island empire may 
place an effective stumbling-block in the path 
of " Adam-zad, the bear that looks like a man."

The Latest Portrait of Voltaire.* 



Words for words, the century and a quarter 
that has elapsed since Voltaire's death has had 
its full and free say about the patriarch of 
Ferney ; and the " hundred volumes of Vol- 
taire " are matched by the bibliography in his 
latest biography, which, curiously enough, con- 
tains just one hundred names, without claiming 
to be exhaustive. In spite of all the wealth of 
material collected by such writers as Desnoires- 
terres, and the biographies by Condorcet, Mr. 
John Morley, and James Parton, Mr. George 
Saintsbury could say, twenty years ago, that 
no really good life of Voltaire, with complete 
examination of his works, existed in any lan- 
guage. If no biographer's equipment is com- 
plete without the ability to make a critical 
estimate of his hero's works, whether written 
or acted, Mr. Saintsbury's remark is probably 
true ; and its truth will not be affected by this 
two-volume book of Mr. Tallentyre's. 

For this is simply the story of Voltaire's life, 
told chronologically from his birth in 1694 to 
his apotheosis and death in 1778. The un- 
broken succession of writings that came from 
his tireless pen are properly reckoned with as 

*Thb Life OF VOLTAiBB. By S. G. Tallentyre. In two 
volumes. Illustrated. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



causes of Voltaire's various flights, conceal- 
ments, imprisonments, or sudden bursts of fame, 
and hence as necessary factors in his life ; but 
there are almost no references or quotations, 
and the reader must go to Voltaire himself for 
first-hand knowledge of his writings, and to the 
pages of Faguet, Van Laun, or Brunetiere for 
criticism. Of the critical spirit, indeed, there 
is not much in these two handsome volumes. 
Mr. Tallentyre's flow of enthusiasm for Vol- 
taire's unquestioned good qualities is not ma- 
terially checked by his honest recognition of 
the baser ones. For these latter, indeed, he 
is an apologist wherever possible ; and English 
readers will probably go back to their Morley, 
Carlyle, or even Macaulay, for a more un- 
biassed view of this wisest, brightest, — trick- 
iest of mankind. 

With these reservations, the narrative is 
delightful reading. Mr. Tallentyre has evi- 
dently digested his authorities thoroughly, from 
the valets Collini and Wagniere down to Victor 
Hugo and Mr. Churton Collins ; and he gives 
us in a picturesque style his results and his own 
opinions in about seven hundred pages, undis- 
figured by footnotes. This latter feature is 
adopted on a principle thus defended by the 
author : 

" If the public cannot trust the ability or the honesty 
of the biographer, the sources of his information are 
not inaccessible, and the public with a little extra 
trouble can verify his facts, even though he does not 
assist it by cumbering his text with that annihilation of 
all interest, the perpetual footnote. If the subject is 
not considered worth the extra trouble, the reader may 
well take the biographer — on faith. . . . The best 
biographer of Voltaire is Voltaire himself. If any 
writer can lead his reader to throw away the biographies, 
even his own, and study Voltaire at first-hand — his 
letters, the wittiest in the world, and his works, which 
in matchless adroitness can be compared to no other 
production of the human mind — he will have done 
much and should be well satisfied." 

To many good people the name Voltaire has 
been little more than a theological expression, 
or at most the designation of a claimant for 
the bad eminence of the eighteenth-century 
antichrist. Of the man Francois Marie Arouet 
as an eager, striving, loving, hating member 
of society they have known little and cared to 
know less. This attitude has now been re- 
placed by the literary and historical interest 
which the most devout may safely feel in the 
most brilliant writer of his age and the prophet 
whose teachings, though not his life, helped to 
prepare the way for a mighty revolution. The 
twentieth-century reader may not approve of 
Voltaire any more after reading these volumes

than before ; but he will have a clear and even 
radiant picture of one of the most interesting 
men that ever lived. 

The glimpses of his precocious childhood 
are of course detached ; but we see the little 
"Zo-Zo" learning to "lisp scoffings as other 
children lisp prayers," taught by the recreant 
abbe CLateauneuf to recite deistical poems, 
entering at ten the Jesuit school of St. Louis 
le Grand, where he posed his masters with 
hard questions in history and politics and 
wrote fluent bad verses, taken by his god- 
father at eleven to see Ninon de I'Enclos, who 
was "as charming at eighty as she had been 
at eighteen," and who was so taken by the 
child that she left him in her will 2000 francs 
to buy books. Leaving school at seventeen, 
young Arouet announced that he desired no 
profession but literature, — to the disgust of 
his father, who, as Mr. Saintsbury says, " re- 
fused to consider literature a profession at all." 
For a while he dabbled in law, and even in 
diplomacy; but was more of a scapegrace than 
a student, and the Regent Philippe d'Orleans 
found it desirable to put the brilliant young 
fellow in the Bastille, where, without pen or 
ink, he composed whole cantos of the " Hen- 
riade," and, among other things, changed his 
name. The question whether the name "Vol- 
taire" is an anagram of "Arouet 1. j. (le 
jeuneV or an abbrevation of " le petit volon- 
taire," one of his baby names, or a real name 
existing in his mother's ancestry, is a vexed 
though not a vital one. The anagram has 
usually proved too tempting to be rejected ; but 
Mr. Tallentyre assures us that the last answer 
is now generally accepted. 

Out of Voltaire's eighty-four years, three 
periods are salient as involving special activ- 
ities in different environments: his fifteen 
years of association with Mme. du Chatelet, 
chiefly spent at Cirey (1733-1748), the fam- 
ous sojourn with Frederick the Great at Ber- 
lin and Potsdam (1750-1753), and the last 
twenty years at Ferney (1758-1778). Of that 
queer household at Cirey — the poet spending 
his money to complete his mistress's chateau, 
the lady herself ("poor little lean brown 
woman," in Carlyle's phrase) filled with pas- 
sions for fine clothes, high play, and the New- 
tonian philosophy; and a dim-shadowy com- 
plaisant husband who knew how to "range 
himself," — of all this Mr. Tallentyre writes 
with much vivacity of manner and many illum- 
inating details. "The respectable Emilie" 
caressed, scolded, and was jealous of her lover 



— until she deserted him for a younger man. 
In this unedifying French domestic drama of 
real life, the woman comes off with the least 
credit ; and one reverts with a sort of satisfac- 
tion to Carlyle's description of Voltaire as 
"hagridden." 

The visit to Frederick the Great is the best- 
known epoch in Voltaire's life. It lasted only 
three years, but was crowded with enough 
adventure, intrigue, spite, adoration, and hard 
work to fit out a lifetime. To English readers, 
long ago, Carlyle's essay on Voltaire, with his 
Life of Frederick, and Macaulay's great essay, 
made the facts familiar, as they knew them. 
Neither of them did justice to Voltaire; and 
Carlyle was too fond of his hero not to give him 
the benefit of every doubt in all this dubious 
business. Mr. Tallentyre seems to see with 
clearer vision, and to hold the balance equit- 
ably between the French man of letters, 
"thievish as a daw and mischievous as a 
monkey," and the Prussian king who was by 
fits and starts his pupil, his adorer, and his 
jailer. The story of how Voltaire made an 
enemy of old Maupertuis, the president of 
Frederick's " Berlin Academy," how Mau- 
pertuis, by the publication of his ridiculous 
" Scientific Letters," exposed himself as fair 
game, and how Voltaire fairly smothered him 
with the delicious satire of "Dr. Akakia," is 
told anew, and with great fulness. 

" Akakia means guilelessness; and Akakia is a phy- 
sician who takes the remarkable effusions of Maupertuis 
with a serious innocence, very deadly; who asks the 
most simple questions in the world; and turns upon the 
President's theories the remorseless logic of the gayest 
and easiest common-sense. There could have been no 
stylfe better than Voltaire's for making Pomposity mad. 
One can still see the * sublime Perpetual President * 
writhing under that pitiless mockery and that infectious 
laugh of malicious delight. The wickedest, cleverest, lit- 
tle picador in all the world goaded this great, lumbering, 
heavy-footed old bull to impotent frenzy. The lithe 
tiger, agile as a cat, sprang on his foe, showing all his 
teeth in his grin, and, grinning still, tore him limb from 
limb." 

Many of Voltaire's most famous inots are 
duly recorded ; and some of his most startling 
utterances are explained and defended. The 
popular belief that in his celebrated motto 
" Ecrasez Vinfame" he voiced his hatred of 
Christ is probably too deep-seated to be re- 
moved by the careful explanations of many 
wise men, assuredly right as they are. Mr. 
Tallentyre is not the first who has sought to 
vindicate the great Deist from this reproach ; 
but his words are worth reproducing. 

" To Voltaire it (Vinfame), if it meant Christianity 
at all, meant that which was taught in Rome in the

eighteenth century, and not by the Sea of Galilee in the 
first. . . . Uinfame was the religion which enforced its 
doctrines by the sword, the fire, and the prison; which 
massacred on the night of St. Bartholomew; and which, 
glossing lightly over royal sins, refused its last consola- 
tions to dying Jansenists who would not accept the Bull 
Unigenitus. ... And above all, Vinfdme was that 
spirit which was the natural enemy of all learning and 
advancement; which loved darkness and hated light be- 
cause its deeds were evil ; which found the better knowl- 
edge of His works, treason to God ; and an exercise of 
the reason and the judgment He had given, an insult to 
the Giver. . . . Uinfame cannot be translated by any 
single word. But if it must be, the best rendering of it 
is, intolerance." 

Voltaire's last days were unquestionably his 
happiest. As the Lord Bountiful of Ferney 
and Tournoy, with grateful friends around 
him, receiving visits from such dissociated 
pilgrims as James Boswell of Auchinleck, the 
young Charles James Fox, and " a solemn 
youth from Lausanne named Edward Gibbon," 
and pouring out, as always, letters, epigrams, 
dramas, he was encouraged to develop the 
better side of his nature ; and his really heroic 
efforts in behalf of such victims of injustice 
and oppression as the Galas family, Sirven, 
La Barre, and the ill-fated Lally are the 
brightest episodes in his career. 

Something of Voltaire's manner seems to 
have descended to his biographer, whose long 
narrative is never tiresome ; though the style 
is at times colloquial to a degree. The vol- 
umes are handsomely printed, contain almost 
no typographical errors, are equipped with a 
full index, and are illustrated with several 
portraits of Voltaire and some of his contem- 
poraries. JosiAH Renick Smith. 



Two French Books on the United 
States.* 



The French books on America written dur- 
ing the last hundred years would easily fill a 
library. The authors of these books have been 
no mean persons, either, — from Chateau- 
briand, La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt,f and de 
Tocqueville, down to Paul Bourget, Henri 
de Varigny, Levasseur, and Th. Bentzon. But 
the plethora seems to have discouraged neither 
authors nor publishers, — to say nothing of

Lb peuplb du XXb sii:cLK. Cinq mois aux Etats-

t A remarkable biography of La Rochefoueauld-Liancourt, 
aristocrat, philanthropist, statesman, traveller, and a most 
interesting figure of the ancient Regime, has just been pub- 
lished by Ferdinand- Dreyfus ( Paris : Plon et Cie. ) . 



readers. Hardly a year passes without the 
publication of a new volume on some topic or 
other dealing with the United States, — " La vie 
aux Etats-Unis," " La femme aux Etats-Unis," 
" Les trusts aux Etats-Unis," and what not. 
Nobody seems to tire of these " Etats-Unis." 
There are two classes of publications on 
America. Some are studies of a special sub- 
ject by a specialist, like Levasseur's book on 
"I'Ouvrier Americain," or de Rousier's work 
on the Trusts. Most of them, however, are the 
general impressions of a traveller after a more 
or less hasty journey made under varying con- 
ditions. The interest of these impressions de- 
pends, of course, on the traveller's intelligence, 
faculty of observation, and general aptitude as 
a writer. 

The two recent books which are treated here 
belong, one to the class of special studies, the 
other to the class of general impressions. Both 
are interesting, because written by men who 
have seen what they talk about and are inter- 
ested in their subject. M. Bargy, who has been 
in this country for five years, is a university 
professor who became interested in the reli- 
gious side of American life. M. Gohier, who 
travelled for five months all over the country, 
is a newspaper man, with a keen eye and a 
skilled pen, although not always with a very 
calm judgment. 

M. Bargy, having lived in a country which 
is mostly Catholic, with a rather limited relig- 
ious life, was surprised to find how great a part 
religious activity plays in American society, as 
well as pleased by the general spirit of true 
liberalism that seems to prevail. He had 
not been much in touch with Protestant ideas 
and Protestant life before finding them here. 
Therefore he ascribes to the American spirit 
many traits that may be due to Protestant in- 
fluence even in non- Protestant churches. All 
things that struck him as new and good in the 
religious conception and the religious method 
of the United States are to him American. He 
discovered what he calls the American religion, 
and characterizes it by two traits : it is a social 
religion, — i. e., more interested in society than 
in the individual ; and it is a positive religion, 
— i. e., it cares more for what is human in re- 
ligion than for what is supernatural. One of 
the main characteristics of American religion 
from the Puritans down, if we were to believe 
him, is indifference to dogma. 

M. Bargy lays down these two principles, 
and from them deduces his conception and 
description of the various forms of religious

activity, Presbyterian or Episcopalian, Con- 
gregational or Methodist, Hebrew or Roman 
Oatholic. In all, he finds the same spirit, 
which he traces back to colonial times, and 
which he considers the common heritage of all 
Americans. To him, religion in America ap- 
pears as " a mutual aid society "; a church is 
^' a cooperative organization and a club "; a 
pastor is " a business man and sociologist," 
working for the material welfare of his flock 
AS well as for their moral betterment. 

A French critic, Edmond Scherer, once said 
that general ideas are always, to a certain extent, 
false. M. Bargy's book supports this statement. 
His bold and over-hasty generalizations are in- 
teresting, to be sure, but far from convincing. 
Not all the traits of American character that 
he praises are specifically American ; and not 
all the praises he bestows are equally deserved. 
It is needless to say that there is no such close 
resemblance between denominations as he de- 
scribes so minutely. As to the indifference to 
dogma, it seems to be a fancy of his imagina- 
tion, as far as most sects are concerned. Never- 
theless, despite the somewhat artificial logic 
that pervades the book, M. Bargy has covered 
the ground in a very instructive and entertain- 
ing way. He has some excellent chapters, full 
of information. Most of his statements are 
accurate, even when the conclusions he draws 
from them are not. Information is always safer 
than theories. The chapter on Channing is 
very good ; and so are the chapters in which 
he describes some modern churches, like St. 
Bartholomew's, and some modern pastors, like 
Babcock and Kainsford. The American reader 
will relish this book, full of enthusiasm, in 
which the author is bent on seeing only what 
is flattering to American pride, and in accord- 
ance with his own theories. Perhaps it might 
be better if all the churches here really had all 
the qualities M. Bargy discovers in them. But 
in that case they would be somewhat different 
from what they are. 

M. Urbain Gohier has also some theories 
which he airs here and there in his book. But 
in the main his purpose is to describe America 
as he saw it a year ago last summer in a quick 
journey of five months, with stops in various 
large cities and university centres. He writes 
in an epigrammatic style, and his Parisian 
readers who are accustomed to his ways will 
take cum grano sails some of his statements 
which may puzzle the American reader. 

On the whole, M. Gohier was pleased with 
America. But he would not be the aggressive 



pamphleteer that he is if he had written a book 
of mere praise and flattery. He was pleased 
with the cleanliness, comfort, and general air 
of happiness of the American home. The 
American woman seemed to him one of the 
most interesting of his discoveries when he 
reached these shores. He found her as pretty 
as the Parisienne, though somewhat spoiled ; 
and he admired her freedom, her initiative, her 
taste and elegance. He praises the univer- 
sities, and all the institutions of learning and 
education generally, such as the social settle- 
ments and the Y. M. C. A. Even the Salva- 
tion Army finds a sympathetic judge in this 
man, who in France has been, although a Cath- 
olic by birth, a rabid anti-clerical. 

The early freedom and self-reliance of the 
American boy struck our author as something 
quite novel. He could not imagine the sons 
of a French university president selling news- 
papers in the streets ! He speaks enthusias- 
tically of the freedom of the individual in the 
family and in society. He enjoyed the luxury 
of the Pullman cars, admired the beautiful site 
of Yellowstone Park, Yosemite Valley, the Bay 
of San Francisco, and the Grand Canon of the 
Colorado River. Everywhere he received the 
impression of something big, tremendously big. 
He regards the American people as an energetic, 
intelligent, quick-witted nation, and be lieves 
that they are the people of the twentieth century. 

But — there is a but. M. Gohier, who is 
known in France as one of the most destruc- 
tive and violent critics of the existing order of 
things, did not merely find things to admire. 
He observed the power and tyranny of the trusts 
and the labor-unions, between which, he pro- 
phesies, the consumer will be crushed. He 
discovered what he calls the " military peril," 
the peril that will come some day from the 
growing strength of the army ; the " clerical 
peril " that will result for American li berty from 
the increasing influence of a numerous dis- 
ciplined and wealthy Roman Catholic Church. 
He reproaches President Roosevelt for his 
sensational attitude, his strenuous ways, and 
his spread-eagleism. While amazed by the 
quantity of work done by the newspapers and 
the tremendous equipment they use, he crit- 
icises the waste of money, time, and paper 
involved in "great" journalism. 

As for American customs, M. Gohier fell 
of course into the usual errors of foreign obser- 
vers, and collected sensational items of love 
stories, crimes, and advertisements, from the 
popular journals. Yet at the same time he 



118 



THE DLAJL 



[Feb. 16, 



observed and noted down many things that the 
average American does not always have his 
attention called to. He visited America at the 
very time of the scandals of the New York 
police and of the St. Louis and Minneapolis 
aldermen, and he has a fearful chapter on 
American political corruption. He saw men 
of so many origins and races in the large 
cities of the East and West that he wondered 
whether this amalgamation of men whose only 
common ties are, in his words, " the English 
language, the ice-cream soda, and chewing- 
gum " really form an Anglo-Saxon nation. 

The craze for physical excercise seems to 
him to be pushed too far. " The Americans 
judge men by their weight, as they do cattle in 
the stock-yards." He notes at the same time 
that this worship of muscle is accompanied by 
an undue development of the patent-medicine 
business. He saw buildings, fifteen stories 
high, filled with druggists and physicians ; and 
the papers were full of quack advertisements. 
At Coney Island he found a camp of palmists, 
and concludes that " America is the chosen 
land of charlatans and bunco-steerers." 

Being a strong anti-militarist, he lectures 
Americans on their admiration for Napoleon, 
" the greatest bandit in history," who had not 
even the excuse of being an athlete. 

The book is thus full of statements and 
judgments that will astonish the reader, and 
sometimes make him throw it down with impa- 
tience ; full also of terse epigrams, and true and 
sound observations. Taken all in all, it shows 
a real sympathy for the spirit, the aims, and 
the character of the American nation and Amer- 
ican civilization. Othon Guerlac. 



Recent Fiction.* 



Mrs. Paget Toynbee, in her preface to the first 
volume of the new Oxford edition of the Letters of 
Horace Walpole, states that 3,061 letters have been 
included, representing 150 correspondents. Of the 
407 letters not included in Cunningham's edition. 111 
are now printed for the first time. It seems that a 
number of the letters, inter alia, to Hannah More, have 
been tampered with, and disfigured by the cancelling 
of passages, the erasure of proper names, and, worse 
than all, by the insertion (apparently in the handwrit- 
ing of Hannah More herself) of words and phrases 
which Walpole never wrote. In one letter the name 
" Madame Piozzi " has been erased, but is still legible 
through the erasure. Wright, the editor of the 1840 
edition of the letters, filled the blank with the name 
of Bruce, the African traveller ! in which he is followed 
by Cunningham. Some of the most interesting of the 
new letters are those addressed by Walpole to his school- 
fellow Charles Lyttelton (afterwards Bishop of Carlyle). 
Of the eleven portraits of Walpole included in this 
edition, three are now published for the first time. 



Place aux dames ! The most important books of 
fiction in our present selection are Mrs. Wharton's 
" Sanctuary " and Miss Glasgow's " The Deliver- 
ance." Each of these novels is, in its ovin peculiar 
fashion, a masterpiece of conscientious workman- 
ship, vivid in its portrayal of a half-tragic situation, 
and powerful in its appeal to our human sympa- 
thies. Aside from their common quality of snc- 
cessf nl performance, the two books stand far apart 
from one another. " Sanctuary " is no more than a 
novelette, hardly more than a short story, while 
" The Deliverance " is a full-grown work of fiction, 
spanning many years of suffering and unachieved 
purpose, and provided with a great multiplicity of 
incident and detail. Bat both are works of art in 
a highly satisfactory sense. 

Mrs. Wharton's art is of subtler and more delicate 
quality than Miss Glasgow's. She presents us with 
a case of conscience, studied in two generations. A 
young woman learns, on the eve of her marriage, 
that the man she loves is endowed with a radical 
weakness of character, that he has sinned, and is 
unwilling to make open confession to the world and 
face the consequences of his dereliction. At first 
her whole high-strung nature revolts, and she casts 
him off. Second thought reverses her decision ; she 
thinks of the moral weakness which must be the 
inheritance of the child of such a man ; she decides 
that she will be the mother of that child, and devote 
her life to its strengthening against the sort of 
temptation to which the father had succumbed. 
This is the brief prologue to the story. The longer 
second part opens some score of years later, and the 
moral problem quickly presents itself. The father 
has long since died, and the son has grown to man- 
hood. The father's sin had taken the form of a 
suppression of evidence the disclosure of which 
would have led to scandal and the loss of fortune.

The son's temptation is to win a prize in his profes- 
sion by appropriating the work of a dead friend, 
and passing it off as his own. The winning of the 
prize will mean to him both professional advance- 
ment and the love of the woman upon whom his 
heart is set. The ensuing conflict between his 
warring impulses is revealed to us only by hints 
and suggestions ; it never comes to a dramatic issue, 
or even to direct discussion. The mother, trembling, 
stands aloof and awaits the outcome upon which 
depends the defeat or victory of a lifetime of con- 
secration to a single aim. Words will not avail ; 
the time has come when the man must save himself 
if he is to be saved at all. We approach the clos- 
ing scene in breathless suspense ; the situation is 
poignant to the extreme of endurance, and the relief 
is correspondingly great when the better nature of 
the young man triumphs, and he seeks the sanctu- 
ary of his mother's arms, seeing at last as by a 
lightning flash all that she has done for him, and 
all the larger implications of the struggle from 
which he has in the end emerged victorious. " I 'm 
not worcn the fight you 've put up for me. But I 
want you to know that it 's your doing — that if you 
had let go an instant I should have gone under — 
and that if I 'd gone under I should never have 
come up again alive." These are the last words of 
this deeply moving book, and they linger long in 
the memory. 

" The Deliverance" is the most important book 
thus far written by Miss Glasgow. It makes clear 
the fact that this novelist has '' come to stay," and 
that her work may be expected to go on broadening 
and deepening with the years. The scene of the 
story is Virginia, and the period is that covered by 
the past quarter- century. Tobacco provides its 
harmony with a sort of basso ostinato very much as 
hemp performs a similar function in one of the 
novels of Mr. James Lane Allen. We are con- 
scious of its presence everywhere as the ground- 
work of the structure, and made to realize that the 
entire scheme of life portrayed by the novelist rests 
upon that foundation. If this be a borrowing of 
Mr. Allen's idea, it is made quite legitimate by the 
original treatment it receives. More questionable, 
however, is the use of Malory at a certain point in 
the narrative, for Miss Glasgow takes the very pas- 
sage introduced with such striking effect in " The 
Choir Invisible," and turns it to exactly the same 
emotional effect. One feature of " The Deliverance " 
is ingeniously contrived, but remains absolutely 
unconvincing. Old Mrs. Blake has been blind since 
the middle of the Civil War, her family has lost its 
fortune, and moved from a colonial -mansion to an 
humble cottage ; yet through all these vicissitudes 
she has been made to believe that nothing is 
changed, that she still owns her hundreds of slaves, 
that the Confederacy has triumphed, and the South 
become a nation. This situation passes the bounds 
of all possible credulity, and, however tempting it 
was to the author, should not have been woven as 
it is into the very structure of her fabric. The love 



interest of the story is provided by Christopher 
Blake, the dispossessed inheritor of the plantation, 
and Maria Fletcher, the granddaughter of the ras- 
cal who has come into its ownership by fraud upon 
his former employer. The boy grows up to hate 
the Fletchers with all the passion of a strong and 
primitive nature ; the girl grows up in ignorance 
alike of the history of her grandfather's fortune 
and of the feelings that rankle in the breast of the 
seeming peasant who is her neighbor. When they 
are first thrown together in their early adult years, 
each is instinctively attracted to the other, while 
assuming the mask of hatred or scorn. Not for 
many years is this instinctive feeling to ripen, and 
in the meanwhile Christopher [goes on nursing his 
hate and planning revenge, while Maria contracts a 
loveless marriage and disappears from the scene for 
a long time. It is by means of this leisurely devel- 
opment that the author achieves her largest effects. 
We know that the outcome is inevitable, but we 
approach it with such deliberation that all the sub- 
tle psychological processes of the years find room 
for analysis and exposition, and the figures of both 
characters become very completely human. The 
book has many minor features and characters de- 
serving of warm praise ; we have not space even for 
their mention, but trust that we have said enough 
to send our readers to one of the strongest and 
most vital productions of recent years. 

"Judith of the Plains," by Miss Marie Manning, 
is a story that starts out in much the same fashion 
as Mr. Garland's " Hesper." A young woman of 
education and refined associations is on her way to 
the strange world of the far West, and is, like Mr. 
Garland's heroine, greatly bewildered by her expe- 
riences. Here, however, the resemblance ends, for 
the young woman is little more than a lay figure in 
the subsequent unfolding of the plot, and the real 
heroine appears in the character of the half-breed 
woman for whom the book is named. After we have 
stopped thinking about the likeness to " Hesper," 
we begin to discover points of resemblance to " The 
Virginian," particularly in the reported speech of the 
Wyoming cowboys, which in its humorous aspect 
seems to us nearly as good as Mr. Wister's best. The 
humor of this story is, indeed, its saving quality, for 
it is very badly constructed, and has no plot worth 
mentioning. Being a woman's novel, it indulges in 
a good deal of rhapsodizing about the desert and 
mountains — an element which a man would have 
minimized or omitted altogether. The writer cer- 
tainly has both style and imagination, and these 
qualities, together with her unfailing humor, make 
up in part for the lack of a definite plan, and keeps 
the story going in a fairly effective way. 

England in the latter half of the fourteenth 
century is the theme of " Long Will," a historical 
romance by Miss Florence Converse. It is the 
England of Chaucer and Gower, of Langland and 
Wyclif , of John Ball and Wat Tyler, of Richard II. 
and John of Gaunt. It is the England of rival 
claimants for the throne, of incipient questionings

of the established faith, of the profound social 
anrest resulting from the Black Death and the 
Statutes of Laborers. All of these men and matters 
are skilfully interwoven into a tapestry of patient 
literary workmanship having for its central figure 
the author of " Piers Plowman," and for its central 
theme the searchings of heart which that extraor- 
dinary poem occasioned among the dumb masses 
of the toilers. Charm is given to the narrative by 
the presence of an imagined daughter of Langland 
and her courtly lover, attendant upon the youthful 
prince and king. The girl goes on a pilgrimage 
through rural England to preach her father's gospel 
of true democracy and to bear the message of the 
coming uprising. The story reaches its climax with 
the peasant revolt, when Wat Tyler and his fol- 
lowers take possession of London and spread terror 
in their train. The skill with which all this mate- 
rial is used deserves high praise, as does also the 
effective use made by the author of the text of 
" Piers Plowman." The book is studded with fit- 
ting excerpts from the poem, applied in such a way 
as to make us understand the passion underlying its 
bald phrases far better than we can understand 
it from reading the histories of literature. Miss 
Converge has grappled in a fairly successful fashion 
with the chief difficulty of her task — that of con- 
triving a mode of speech which shall be really in 
keeping with the age she depicts. What she has 
done may best be shown by an example. The words 
are Long Will's, spoken in soliloquy. 

" Pity me, God I I am a weak man ! — I did never no 
deeds but them I thought not to do ; — never, all my life 
long ! Count my deeds, O Qod, — they are so few, — and all 
of them have I condemned afore in other men. Now, I let 
my daughter go forth on a fool's errand, and in a child's plot 
that must fail ; mayhap she will meet worse than death on 
the road ; but I give her my blessing. Jesu, — Mary, — guard 
this my daughter that I have so weakly put forth upon the 
world ! How may a man dare say nay to his child, if she be 
a better man than he, — an actyf man, a doer o' deeds ? How 
may a man dare forbid any soul to follow Conscience ? Oood 
Jesu, I am but a jongleur, — a teller o' tales, — i am afeared 
o' deeds. I see them on so many sides that I dare move nor 
hand nor foot. And if I do, I trip. Best never be doing. — 
If a man might be all words, and no deeds ! " 

The diction of which this is a typical illustration 
will at once be seen to embody not a little of the 
fourteenth century English fashion in its simple 
directness, its quaint naiveti, and its hint of the 
unassimilated French element in the language. It 
is sometimes too stiff, and the illusion is far from 
complete at many points, but how admirable it is 
in comparison with the conventional phrasing of the 
bastard jargon which serves the average historical 
romancer for a medium ! Here, at least, is a seri- 
ous effort to achieve reality, and not a deliberate 
evasion of the whole problem. 

It must have taken a lively imagination to invent 
the character of Babington, the university president 
who is the central figure in " The Torch," by Pro- 
fessor Herbert M. Hopkins. Babington presides 
over a Western institution, and is a compound of 
bully and hypocrite, tuft-hunter and snob. When 



a member of the faculty incurs his dislike, he says, 
" Off with his head ! " like the Qaeen in " Alice," 
and off it goes. We have a fairly wide acquaintance 
among university presidents, but have never met 
with a specimen at all resembling this caricature. 
Now Mr. Hopkins, in writing the present book, had 
a very laudable design. It was his aim to protest 
against the autocratic character of the management 
of many of our universities, and to plead against 
the evils which naturally result from too great a 
concentration of power in the executive. These 
evils are manifest in many quarters, and such a 
protest is desirable. But the whole purpose of the 
argument is defeated by the grossly improbable 
account given us of this particular executive and 
his acts. Furthermore, Mr. Hopkins has committed 
something worse than an indiscretion in selecting 
certain happenings in the recent history of a great 
Western university, presenting them in a sensa- 
tional light, and basing upon them the very struc- 
ture of his story. No one can read the book with- 
out perceiving at once that a particular president 
of a particular university is aimed at, and no one 
acquainted with the institution and the man can 
fail to be shocked at the travesty. Unfortunately, 
the book will find many readers who are without 
the personal knowledge necessary for a corrective, 
and such readers will be influenced by an account 
which is distorted and discolored from beginning 
to end. The mischief will be the greater for the 
very fact that the story is strongly conceived, and, 
although misleading as a whole, embodies many 
fragments of undoubted truth. It is in vain to 
plead that the novelist takes his suggestions wher- 
ever he may find them; in the present case he has 
done more than act upon a mere suggestion : he 
has seized upon a situation already made familiar 
to thousands of readers through the sensational 
newspaper press, and has so dealt with it as to' 
create prejudices of the bitterest sort in the minds 
of readers not conversant with the facts in the case. 
There is no doubt that Mr. Henry Harland's 
late novels have the very quintessence of charm. 
This charm results from a dainty style formed upon 
the best French models, a marked delicacy of poetic 
sentiment, and an exquisite sense of proportion and 
fitness. Yet the charm is absolutely superficial, and 
the depths of character have no existence as far as 
the figures which people his pages are concerned. 
" My Friend Prospero " is the gay and joyous love- 
story of an English nobleman and an Austrian 
princess, thrown together in an Italian castle and 
the surrounding landscape. Each remains ignorant 
of the rank, and even the name of the other, until 
the very end, when a fairy godmother reveals both 
secrets, and clears the way for a mutual under- 
standing. A story like this is no more amenable 
to serious criticism than a butterfly or a humming- 
bird, yet we are disposed to suggest two matters 
that come near to being defects. One of them is 
the introduction for one brief scene of the Ameri- 
can friend of the hero, who plays no real part in 



1904.]

the story, and serves only to help the hero make 
-conversation when next he meets his heart's desire. 
The other is a certain over-insistence upon the 
money motive, which clouds the bright romantic 
Atmosphere of the tale. Such lovers as these have 
nothing to do with such considerations ; they are 
not denizens of a material and mercenary world, 
and their fortunes are not bound up in the ordinary 
-concerns of an average prosaic humanity. 

Mr. Will Payne's new story, " Mr. Salt," offers 
us another picture of commercialism in a great 
-city, this time in vignette form, for the work is 
hardly more than a novelette. The hero — if we 
may apply to him that useful term — is a captain 
of industry, and the heroine one of his stenogra- 
phers. Since one of the first acts of the latter is to 
commit perjury in a court of justice, in the inter- 
-ests of her employer, we must be excused for a cer- 
tain inability to follow her career with complete 
-sympathy. The romance between the man and the 
woman grows apace, and ends in the usual way. 
The story is written from full knowledge of the 
sort of life with which it deals, and is not without 
touches of delicate human feeling. It certainly 
gives us life — of a sort — and it comes near to 
giving us literature — of a minor order. 

The American railway is the real subject of Mr. 
Frank Spearman's " The Daughter of a Magnate," 
although a love-story is provided as a sort of sub- 
sidiary attraction, and as a concession to the con- 
ventions of fiction. The scene is the far West, the 
language is that spoken in those parts by men en- 
gaged in railway work. It is rather too technical 
for the comfort of the average reader. " Even the 
porter of the dead car deserted his official corpse, 
and after Number One pulled out of Medicine Bend 
and stuck her slim, aristocratic nose fairly into the 
big ranges the Lalla Rookh was left as dead as a 
stringer to herself and her reflections " — this is the 
sort of thing we find in every chapter. We have 
no doubt of its truth to life and to railroading, but 
too much of it wearisome. There is always some- 
thing fine in the spectacle of man struggling against 
nature and coming out triumphant; we get this 
sort of satisfaction in two scenes particularly, one 
of which represents the hero at work repairing the 
damage done by a disastrous washout, while the 
other finds him bringing a train (and the heroine) 
safely through a perilous blizzard. The whole story 
is informed with a tense energy that at least keeps 
one in a state of breathless attention to its movement. 

A novel written even in part by the late Stephen 
Crane comes to us at this late day as a surprise. 
The other part is the work of Mr. Robert Barr, but 
whether by way of collaboration or the piecing-out 
of a fragment we are not informed. At all events, 
the book is not obviously composite, and proves to 
be much more of a story than any of the books of 
Mr. Crane that were published during his lifetime. 
It is called « The O'Ruddy," and is the tale of a 
roistering and dare-devil Irishman who comes to 
England after his father's death on a mission to the 



Earl of Westport, falls in love with the earl's 
daughter, and wins her by sheer audacity in the 
face of all sorts of obstacles. The depiction of this 
character and the account of his deeds seem to be 
intended as a satire upon this particular type of 
swashbuckling adventure, and the stock situations 
are outlined in a spirit of extravagant burlesque 
which is highly amusing. The book is a singularly 
racy one, and may be read with unflagging interest. 

When we reviewed " The Bath Comedy," by 
Mr. and Mrs. Egerton Castle, we remarked that we 
" would gladly remain in such company for an in- 
definite period." It is to the same company of 
Mistress Kitty and her satellites that we are again 
introduced by <' Incomparable Bellairs," the sequel 
which the authors have kindly provided for the 
earlier book. Kitty is as capricious and bewitch- 
ing as ever, and her devoted Irish lover (who really 
wins her this time) is as audacious and reckless as 
when he made his first desperate siege of her affec- 
tions. Other figures appear, notably that of a gra- 
cious Quaker maiden, who serves as an effective 
foil to the titular heroine. The book is a mixture 
of wit and tender sentiment, alternately sparkling 
with the one and melting with the other, and is 
fascinating from first to last. 

In " The Shutters of Silence," Mr. G. B. Burgin 
has made effective use of a Trappist monastery in 
the northern wilderness of Canada. In this estab- 
lishment a boy, abandoned by his mother and lost 
by his father, takes refuge, and grows to manhood 
in its peaceful and austere seclusion. He is of ille- 
gitimate birth and his unnatural mother has rid 
herself of him in order that she may marry and be 
safe from the discovery of her sin. When the boy 
has grown up, the father learns his whereabouts, 
and rescues him before he has taken his vows to 
the order. He is taken to England, introduced to 
society, and made to know something of the joys 
and sorrows of life. Next to the description of the 
monastic life itself, which is pictured with sombre 
and haunting fidelity, the study of his development 
under this startling change of conditions is the most 
interesting feature of the story, The young man 
falls in love, but the cup of happiness is dashed from 
his lips when he learns the secret of his birth, and 
he flees to the refuge of his earlier years. Here he 
is at last found by both father and mother, the 
former now a widow and the latter at the point of 
death ; a belated marriage ceremony takes place, 
and the youth goes back into the world with a name 
that he may now legitimately bear. Such is the out- 
line of a story which may lay claim to a fair degree 
of originality, and which is of more than ordinary 
interest. 

"The Key of Paradise," by Mr. Sidney Pickering, 
is an Italian romance of a hundred years ago, when 
the Napoleonic wars filled the world, and brought 
terror into the fairest of lands. The interest of the 
story, however, is private, and the history serves only 
for relief. There is an Italian princess, the husband 
who maltreats her, and the sympathetic English

soldier who seeks to win her love. The outcome 
is rather unexpected, for the princess, despite her 
wrongs, remains faithful to her marital obligations, 
and wins her husband's devotion in the end. The 
work is carefully planned, and wrought out with 
such nicety of finish that, although the performance 
is slight, it is unusually satisfactory from every 
artistic point of view.

Briefs ox New Books. 



Let no one suppose from the plain 
^^t^r/"*"^'' t'tle "Ferns, a Manual for the 

own book. ' 

Northeastern States" (Holt), by 
Mr. Campbell E. Waters, that we have here simply 
a text-book, or at best a descriptive list of species, 
as manuals of plants and animals are wont to be. 
The work is this, and very much more. It is a very 
handsome volume, beautifully bound and printed, 
with ornate cover and gilt top, fit to lie upon the 
table among the latest and handsomest books of the 
year. Furthermore, text and illustrations alike are 
not designed primarily for the man of science, but 
for the amateur, for the men and women who love 
ferns, the most graceful and beautiful forms of all 
the green world about us, and, loving them, would 
fain be able to give appropriate name to each and 
every one. To such the volume will certainly make 
a strong appeal. The original feature in the pres- 
ent treatment of the ferns is the effort made to use 
stem-structure, revealed in cross-section, as a means 
of identification and so for the framing of an arti- 
ficial key. This may sometimes be helpful, and the 
facts so brought out may be at times confirmatory ; 
but after all, it would seem that anyone sufficiently 
skilful to use his lens to meet the requirements of 
this key should be able to study in the old-fashioned 
way the fruit-dots, indusia, pinnae, etc., and would 
find the effort far more interesting. For some 
reason, several species described in the text are not 
named in this key. The illustrations are nearly all 
half-tones from photographs, and show well the 
advantages and disadvantages of the process. The 
views of the species in their native haunts are, many 
of them, very beautiful ; but the reproductions of 
the individual fronds are generally disappointing. 
The process is not adapted to the subject. The 
delicacy of these filmy things is lost. This is espe- 
cially the case where the illustration represents the 
object enlarged. Here the photograph reminds one 
of the pictures of plaster- casts taken from the faces 
of the dead. Photography cannot, or at least does 
not, portray these things. One touch of Gibson's 
pencil were worth it all. No doubt some of the 
illustrations, showing details, fructifications, sori, 
etc., will be serviceable in identifying generic types ; 
but the camera is clearest only where it is less needed, 
as in the case of some of the shield-ferns and spleen- 
worts, and brings no help, or little, where illustra- 
tion should serve. Thus, the figure intended to 



illustrate the indusia of Cystopteris shows really 
nothing that can be so recognized. Our author 
wisely gives precedence in each case to the common 
name ; but he also presents the name by which each 
form is known in science, although without citing 
the name of the author of the binomial approved. 
While it is refreshing to be delivered from the cus- 
tomary inane discussions of questions of nomencla- 
ture, still no scientific name in natural history may 
be correctly written unless the name of the author 
accompanies it. It may be worth saying here that 
for appearance sake, if for no other reason, it were 
well to begin every specific name, no matter what 
its origin, with a small letter. But these are minor 
criticisms ; the book as a whole is a beautiful one, 
and likely to be widely useful. It is one of the few 
real nature-study books so far offered to the Amer- 
ican people. Here is no nonsense, no child's-talk ; 
and 'if the author's style be somewhat conversa- 
tional, and confidential at times, he nevertheless 
tells his story in an interesting and straightforward 
way. 

There is a fascination in any bio- 
a^£!^HU "^ graphic material relating to the Roe- 

setti family. The readers of the 
new volume of " Rossetti Papers, 1862 to 1870 " 
(imported by Scribner) will feel the charm of the 
subject, and will delight in subtle glimpses of char- 
acter and environment, but they will deplore the 
lack of chapters or similar divisions into which the 
material might have been more conveniently and 
effectively grouped. More than five hundred pages 
of consecutive letters and journal-extracts, with a 
few parenthetical notes, become wearisome when 
there is no break in structure and but meagre 
dramatic incident. This volume continues the twa 
earlier compilations entitled " Ruskin, Rossetti, 
Preraphaelitism " and " Preraphaelite Diaries and 
Letters." The latter volume ended with the death 
of Gabriel Rossetti's wife, and the burial of his 
poems in her casket ; the present book deals with 
the intervening events until 1870, when the poems 
were resurrected and published. Much of the ma- 
terial here presented has been incorporated already, 
indirectly, into other books upon the Rossetti family. 
With a revival of interest which comes from a 
perusal of the direct sources, however, one reads 
again of the estranged relations between Ruskin 
and Rossetti, of the brotherly interest of Gabriel 
in the publication of Christina Rossetti's poems, of 
William Rossetti's appreciative studies of Walt 
Whitman, Shelley, and Blake, and of the tragic 
blight upon the eyes of Gabriel and his forced renun- 
ciation of art. The growth of the artist's power 
and popularity, the submerged yet exquisite skill 
of the poet, are clearly portrayed in the letters of 
friendship and appreciative criticism from Ruskin, 
Hamerton, Madox Brown, William Bell Scott, 
Mrs. Gilchrist, and the American friends. Professor 
Norton and W. J. Stillman. Among the later and 
most interesting of the letters is one written by

Gabriel from Scalanda, Sussex, to Professor and 
Mrs. Norton, then at Florence. In it, he refuses an 
invitation to join them, because of his troublesome 
eyes, but expresses the most cordial friendship in 
a tone of unwonted intimacy. Of the poems then 
just published he wrote : 

" I hope that when you get my book you will agree with 
me as to the justness of my including all it contains. I say 
this because there are a few things — and notably a poem 
called Jenny — which will raise objections in some quarters. 
I only know that they have been written neither recklessly 
nor aggressively (moods which I think are sure to result in 
the ruin of Art), but from a true impulse to deal with sub- 
jects which seem to me capable of being brought rightly within 
Art's province. Of my own position I feel sure, and so wait 
the final result without apprehension." 

Practical essays *' Lectures on Commerce" (Univer- 
«n commerce and sity of Chicago Press) is the title of 
industry. ^ volume edited by Mr. Henry Rand 

Hatfield, and containing sixteen papers read before 
the students of the recently founded College of 
Commerce and Administration in the University 
of Chicago. In the first of these papers, entitled 
"Higher Commercial Education," Professor J. 
Laurence Laughlin, dean of the new college, pre- 
sumably defines the scope of the undertaking. « To 
the virile and enterprising spirits who are tempted 
by the great rewards of banking, railways, insur- 
ance, trade and industry," he observes, " the uni- 
versities have — at least not until very recently — 
offered no inducements." Further on, he says : 
" It is startling to think how little influence the 
universities of to-day have had in training the great 
men in the constituencies of banking, railways, in- 
surance, trade and industry, diplomacy, journalism, 
and politics." Only with reference to the older 
subjects, the " humanities," does he accord '* accu- 
racy of statement, precision, logic, the judicial spirit, 
the love of truth, and a sense of form," and he asks 
if it is not possible to extend these virtues into the 
actualities of commerce and administration. But 
the stress of his remarks seems still to be laid upon 
" the great rewards," " the great men," and not 
upon " the love of truth." His lecture also illus- 
trates the prime diflficulties of the new education 
in a brief discussion of journalism, assuming as 
he does that the practical training of a newspaper 
office makes *' hacks," and that " the policy and 
influence of a newspaper depend upon whether 
or not it shows a masterly grasp of the political, 
economic, legal, and literary subjects which the 
public are thinking about." But it is not because 
of their editorial columns, where this " masterly 
grasp " may only be displayed, that modern news- 
papers are influential; it is because of their news 
columns almost wholly. The real journalistic 
" hacks " are those with the training Professor 
Laughlin intends giving in the college of which he 
is dean ; " the great rewards " come to those whom 
he thinks are made into " hacks." The fact is, in 
the last analysis, that newspaper success depends 
mainly upon such a knowledge of contemporary life 
as is denied university faculties by the very terms 



of their being. The remaining lectures in the vol- 
ume are by railway men, merchants, manufacturers, 
and bankers well known in the city of Chicago, few 
of them with any theoretical training, but all with 
achieved success gained by personal effort and 
practical work. These papers make most interest- 
ing and instructive reading ; but it cannot be said 
that they lend themselves to proof of Professor 
Laughlin's contentions for his new school. 

The mournful narrative of England's 
The wofui past seven centuries of oppression and 

misgovernment in Ireland has been 
retold in summarized form by Mr. Thomas Addis 
Emmet, under the composite title of "Ireland under 
English Rule,or A Pleaforthe Plaintiff " (Putnam). 
He tells his profoundly moving story in calm and 
dignified language, without outburst or objurgation. 
The only severity found in his relation inheres 
in the extraordinary character of the events re- 
cited, and throughout his work the historical spirit 
dominates. It does not, however, profess to be a 
history ; it is a historical summary, merely, but one 
susceptible of much use by students. Mr. Emmet's 
"plea" consists largely of copious extracts from 
historical writings of past centuries. Naturally, 
these quotations are derived in great measure from 
Irish sources, yet enough of them appear from 
British and continental writers to relieve the book 
from any appearance of resting on a purely parti- 
san basis. The writers quoted are all in substan- 
tial accord as to the merits of Ireland's claims and 
the character of her wrongs. A running thread of 
judicious commentary by the author connects to- 
gether this summary of quotations from older 
writers. The sad history will appeal forcibly to 
American readers, for whom primarily Mr, Emmet 
writes. But one can read between the lines a calm 
and earnest address to the better sense of the 
British people, whose government it is, and not 
themselves, that is so severely indicted. While Mr. 
Emmet confessedly " holds a brief " for the cause 
of Ireland, and has prepared his essay in some 
sense officially, as the President of the " Irish Na- 
tional Federation of America," it is not merely nor 
even largely an oratorical effort. It is apparent 
from the character and style of the " plea " that the 
pleader feels a day of redemption for Ireland is at 
hand, and that his summary of the merits of the 
cause he loves is intended, not to increase nor even 
to perpetuate the past tension, but to lead toward 
and assist in establishing a better and a more harmo- 
nious understanding for the future as to the deserts 
of Ireland. These two handsomely printed volumes 
are a worthy American contribution toward that de- 
sirable result, while at the same time furnishing 
much justification for the Irish contention of the past 
centuries. A bibliography of one hundred and 
seventy titles attests the extent of reading which has 
qualified Mr. Emmet for the work he has undertaken 
of arousing in a new form, for the new century, in- 
terest in the welfare of " the Emerald Isle."

[Feb. 16, 



Lord Ronald That a part is often better than the 
Stt/heriand-Oower whole is well illustrated by Lord 
in abridgment. Ronald Sutherland-Gower'fl "Rec- 
ords and Reminiscences " (inaported by Scribner), 
a handsome and profusely illustrated octavo of 624 
pages. It is at once an amalgamation and an abridg- 
ment of the author's well-known '' Reminiscences " 
and *' Old Diaries," the curtailed one-volume form 
being prepared, we are told, by request. But even 
in abridgment the noble lord has in no wise slighted 
the claims due to himself and his family, fifty pages 
being devoted to the record of his birth and ances- 
try. Although a man's progenitors, like his chil- 
dren, are more interesting to himself than to others, 
the author has succeeded in enlivening these open- 
ing chapters with anecdote and history of some- 
thing more than personal significance. Under his 
genial guidance we follow the fortunes of the 
Sutherlands, the Gowers, and the Levesons — for 
all three are his family names, though he contents 
himself with the use of but two — and find them 
in general prosperous even to the point of tameness. 
This tameness is occasionally relieved, however, as 
by the fatal poisoning of the eleventh earl of Suther- 
land and his Countess, in 1567, by Lady Isabel 
Sinclair. The tragedy was attended by other thrill- 
ing events worthy to be embalmed by the historical 
novelist. On the Gower side of the house, one of 
the family was all but immortalized, unenviably, by 
having his name inserted in Dr. Johnson's Dictionary 
as a synonym for renegade ; bat the printer refused 
to humor the lexicographer. Such, at least, is the 
story. In the author's account of Cliveden House 
he takes unnecessary pains to quote from Pope that 
familiar but untruthful line which places the death 
of Buckingham " in the worst inn's worst room," 
whereas the Duke breathed his last in the farm- 
house of one of his tenants. As is already known, 
it is Lord Sutherland-Gower's extended travels and 
his interviews with noted persons that give the chief 
value and interest to his pages. In this particular 
the new book has all the charm of its parent vol- 
umes, besides being freed from many of their 
superfluities. But the reviewer, to be true to his 
traditions, must note with regret the lack of an 
index. 

A great many besides those who dare

seur will rejoice in the series of luxu- 
riant monographs projected by Messrs. G. F. Put- 
nam's Sons, in connection with an English house, 
under the general title of '^ The Connoisseur's 
Library." The series will comprise twenty volumes 
in all, covering exhaustively and authoritatively 
every form of objet d'art affected by the modern 
collector. The- editor of the series, Mr. Cyril 
Davenport, is responsible for the initial volume, 
dealing with Mezzotints, the most interesting and 
beautiful, as well as the most difficult to produce, 
of all forms of artistic engraving. Mr. Davenport 
knows his subject thoroughly, and though there is 



of necessity much technical matter in his pages, he 
is always lucid and intelligible even to the tyro. 
The first chapter has to do with the practical side 
of the subject, describing minutely the technical 
process of mezzotint engraving, both in monotone 
and color, and giving directions for the care, 
preservation, and identification of prints. The re- 
maining three chapters are largely historical and 
critical, dealing respectively with the best known 
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth century 
engravers. It is interesting to know that, though 
engraving in mezzotint has not lacked for exponents 
on the continent, the greatest masters in this me- 
dium have been Englishmen, and mezzotinting may 
properly be called an English art. For the future 
of his subject Mr. Davenport is not very hopeful. 
A few gifted mezzotinters are still working, but the 
recently improved methods in photogravure repro- 
duction have introduced a formidable rival to the 
art. Modern photogravure work has not yet been 
able to attain the depth and velvety lustre of pure 
mezzotinting ; and being almost entirely a mechan- 
ical process it may never hope for much favor in the 
eyes of collectors. But for all practical ends the 
photogravure fills the place of the mezzotint, and 
is of course infinitely less expensive, especially 
where large numbers of prints are required. The 
plates selected to illustrate Mr. Davenport's text 
are excellent specimens of the best results in modern 
photogravure work. There are forty in all, exem- 
plifying the art of nearly every master in mezzotint 
engraving. The mechanical form of the present 
volume is dignified and excellent in every detail, as 
such a work should be. The binding especially, so 
often a deplorable feature in English book-making, 
is thoroughly serviceable, a minor point worthy of 
commendation being the method of mounting the 
plates on linen guards instead of flimsily sewing 
them in, as is almost invariably done. 

That the fashion of regarding his- 

Ameriean hittory ^ g^igj ^^^^ ^^^ viewpoint of 

and geography. ,.,."' . . '^ . , 

politics IS passing away, is evident 
from two books which have recently appeared. The 
first, by Miss Ellen Churchill Semple, is entitled 
"American History and its Geographic Conditions" 
(Houghton), and presents an extremely careful and 
comprehensive arrangement of the successive events 
in American history, with a convincing argument 
to prove that the determinant factors in its develop- 
ment are geographical. The second book, by Mr. 
Albert Perry Brigham, " Geographical Influence in 
American History" (Ginn), is a shorter work, evi- 
dently designed to show what are the geographical 
and geological features of America, and to prove 
that these are real, but by no means the only, in- 
fluences in the country's development. This author 
lays great stress on the fact that racial characteris- 
tics help to mould civilization ; herein differing from 
Miss Semple, who declares their impotency, citing 
the comparison of Canada and the United States as 
an example. Both Miss Semple and Mr. Brigham.

give essentially the same descriptions of the purely 
geographical conditions of America: the various 
sections of the country, their topographical features 
and connecting waterways. But while Mr. Brigham 
takes geology as his point of departure, and has a 
great deal to say of " the background of ages of 
physical evolution," the " glacial belt," and the 
«' ice-sheets," Miss Semple confines herself to com- 
paratively modern conditions, — i. e., to those since 
the discovery of America. Moreover, although she 
treats such subjects as the Early Settlements, the 
Louisiana Purchase, and the Civil War, in detail, 
yet she places her emphasis on the present and 
future. This is especially true of her chapters on 
the geographical distribution of cities and indus- 
tries, and of railroads. And aside from the differ- 
ent points of departure, the further treatments of 
the subject differ, — that of Miss Semple being 
the more detailed, that of Mr. Brigham the more 
general. Miss Semple states in the beginning her 
conclusion : " The most important geographical fact 
in the past history of the United States has been 
their location on the Atlantic opposite Europe ; and 
the most important geographical fact in lending a 
distinctive character to their future history will 
probably be their location on the Pacific opposite 
Asia." Mr. Brigham similarly gives as '' the one 
fact of overshadowing importance in the history of 
America, that a wide ocean separated an advanced 
civilization and a relatively dense population from 
a wide, rich, and almost unoccupied continent." 
Both books are of unusual interest, not only to the his- 
torian and geographer, but also to the general reader. 

In Miss Lilian Pettengill's book en- 
The problem, 0/ jj^jg^j u Toilers of the Home" (Dodd, 

Mead & Co.), another attempt is 
made to throw light upon the question of domestic 
service. Believing that the opinions of the average 
mistress are not only vague but unfair, the author 
spent nearly a year in household service, that she 
might view the problem from all sides. It would 
perhaps be impertinent to suggest that experience 
as mistress might also be necessary to absolute fair- 
ness. But the author is evidently sincere in her 
intention, and the book might furnish a wealth of 
material for discussion in a woman's club. She 
records, in five somewhat long chapters, her experi- 
ence in as many families. The book is full of details 
and personal gossip, and certainly presents all sorts 
and conditions of women, from the delightful " spin- 
sters three" to the would-be great lady and the 
all-too-rare good housekeeper. The conclusions, 
summed up in a final chapter, add nothing to facts 
already worn with much discussion ; their greatest 
interest is in their na'ivetS. The long and indefinite 
hours of service, the lack of home and social life, 
and the supposed disgrace of being a domestic ser- 
vant, are mentioned as the difficult factors in any 
satisfactory settlement of the problem. By way 
of solution. Miss Pettengill suggests that servants 
should never live in the houses of their employers, but 



in homes of their own, or in little colonies by them- 
selves. In this way she thinks the work would be- 
come more definite, the grade of service demanded 
and rendered improved, and the loneliness of the 
position remedied. In all this, it is a question 
whether the remedy is not worse than the disease; 
but we must heartily agree with the statement that 
" the housekeeper's problem is largely one of self- 
government." The sub-title of the book, '' A Col- 
lege Woman's Experience as a Domestic Servant," 
leads one to wonder what college training resulted 
in the production of an English style so careless, 
would-be-sarcastic, and often obscure, as that con- 
stantly used by the author.

The self-told •L it/-, i i r 

story 0/ a lessor Joseph LieConte completed for 

noble life. jjjg children and grandchildren a 

sketch of his eventful life. This autobiography 
has been prepared for publication (Appleton) by 
Professor W. D. Armes, his pupil and colleague. 
LeConte was born of Huguenot and Puritan par- 
entage, in the New England community in Liberty 
County, Georgia, in a family noted for its intellect- 
ual brilliancy and scientific predilections. It is not 
strange, therefore, that he should have chosen med- 
icine as a career ; nor that he should have found its 
practice, as conducted in those days, very irksome. 
The early chapters of the autobiography, dealing 
with these years, give a charming picture of social 
life in ante-bellum days on Southern plantations. 
In 1850 LeConte went to Cambridge and became 
one of Agassiz's first pupils, graduating in the first 
class from the Lawrence Scientific School. He at 
once began his busy career as educator, investigator, 
scientist, and philosopher, at first in his native South 
and after the war on the Pacific Coast. His ac- 
count of an extended tour through the Northwest 
and about the Great Lakes, in 1844, and his por- 
trayal of conditions in the South during and after 
the war, are of historical value as faithful pictures 
of the times, and these, as well as the whole book, 
are written in charming style, simple and direct, so 
that the interest of the reader never flags. The 
greatest value of the book lies, however, in its par- 
tial self -revelation of the man whose intellectual 
virility and gentle unfailing courtesy made " Pro- 
fessor Joe " the idol of many generations of students, 
and still keep his memory green from the Sierras 

to the sea.

given much serious thought; but thus 
far the marvellous career of the great Protector and 
the tragic death of Charles Stuart have received the 
greater share of this attention. Charles II., on the 
other hand, has not proved so attractive a subject 
either to the historian or to the novelist. Recently, 
however, that inglorious monarch has found an en- 
thusiastic biographer in Mr. Allan Fea, who seems 
to have made the Restoration period his particular 
field of research. Not long ago he published an

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



account of Prince Charles's escape across the Chan- 
nel after the battle of Worcester ; this year he has 
given us a companion volume entitled " After Wor- 
cester Fight" (John Lane). In this new work he 
republishes the materials used in writing ^' The 
Flight of the King," consisting of five tracts pro- 
duced either in printed or manuscript form during 
the reign of Charles II. Source materials are, as 
a rule, not very interesting reading, but in this case 
a work has been compiled which is singularly at- 
tractive. The book is beautifully printed and sup- 
plied with numerous illustrations of historic value. 
The editorial work has been done with considerable 
care ; the editor has added some information from 
tradition and state-papers, most of which is, how- 
ever, of the antiquarian order and has but slight 
value as history. Still, Mr. Fea's zeal is to be com- 
mended, and anyone who has read his earlier work 
will be sure to appreciate this companion volume. 

Dangers of "^^^ popularization of the results of 

popularizing research in the various fields of the 

teitnce. physical and natural sciences is more 

and more demanded by the ever increasing class 
of readers whose previous information and training 
have opened to them the gates of science, but who 
still lack the technical information or the recourse 
to original sources which alone can give immediate 
access to her latest revelations. Our popular mag- 
azines have attempted to meet this demand, in some 
cases by contributions from specialists, in others, 
unfortunately, from less trustworthy sources. Not 
only readability, but reliability, is a prime requisite, 
if such papers are to command respect in scientific 
circles. Mr. Carl Snyder's " New Conceptions in 
Science" (Harper) meets the first prerequisite, for 
here the latest news from the firing-line of research 
is given with the dash and abandon of the field cor- 
respondent, and with something also of his disre- 
gard for the petty details of fact. The author is not 
an authority in any field of science ; yet he essays 
what no single expert would dare, a "clear and con- 
cise exposition of the newest conceptions in science 
in various fields." To an evident lack of informa- 
tion on the older and more fundamental conceptions 
and facts of science, the author adds his attitude of 
the special-pleader for a materialistic philosophy, 
and for fundamental changes in present social 
methods. The critical reader, though not informed 
in the technicalities of science, may readily detect 
fallacies in these parts of the book. 



Everyday life in 
Autlria-Hungary. 



If for no other reason, the dual king- 
dom known as Austria-Hungary is of 
world-wide interest because of the 
strange assemblage of races occupying the domin- 
ions of Emperor Francis Joseph. The Germanic 
Austrians and the Hungarians or Magyars, taken 
together, form less than half of the total popula- 
tion. The majority of Austro-Hungarian peoples 
belong to races which are neither "Austrian" nor 
Hungarian," properly so-called. Most of them 



are of Slavonic origin, — Czechs, Croatians, Servians, 
Ruthenes, Poles, Slovaks, and Austrian Bulgarians, 
Others are of races nearly allied to the Latin group. 
— Roumanians or Wallachians, and Italians. And 
of Jews, Greeks, Turks, and Gipsies, there are not 
a few. There are corresponding differences of lan- 
guage, religion, and habits of life, making it diffi- 
cult to describe in a single volume the characteris- 
tics of such a complex nationality. Yet we find 
this dual kingdom and its people not only intelli- 
gently, but most entertainingly, treated by Mr. 
Francis H. E. Palmer, in "Austro-Hungarian 
Life in Town and Country," issued as a volume 
in "Our European Neighbours" series (Putnam). 
Possibly the author's successful treatment of his 
difficult subject is due to his having already fur- 
nished a volume upon Russian life in the same 
series. With Russian life he repeatedly compares 
what he finds in Austria-Hungary, and he gives 
us an insight into Austro-Hungarian affairs that it 
would be scarcely possible to obtain otherwise than 
through a long residence in the country. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mark Twain's " Jumping Frog " in what may be 
called its tri-lingual form is made into a small volume 
of its own by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. The text 
comprises the original English of the tale, then the 
French version as published in the " Revue des Deux 
Mondes," and finally the author's painful reconstruc- 
tion of his pet story, "clawed back into a civilized lan- 
guage once more by patient, unremunerated toil." This 
re- translation is one of the funniest things ever done 
by Mark Twain, and goes well with his commentary on 
the German language. 

Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. publish two com- 
panion volumes respectively entitled " A Book of Amer- 
ican Prose Humor" and " A Book of American Humor- 
ous Verse." The editing is anonymous, but appears 
to be particularly well done in the case of the volume 
of verse. The other volume, representing only a baker's 
dozen of authors, did not offer the same opportunity for 
skilful selection and combination. Both are noteworthy 
for the representation of very recent humorous writing. 

A recent addition to the "Historic Lives" series 
(Appletons) is a volume on Champlain, the founder of 
New France, by Mr. Edwin Asa Dix. The various 
editions of Champlain's "Voyages" seem to have been 
followed closely in collecting the material for the 
sketch, and a number of Champlain's drawings from the 
same source are reproduced. It is a modest and straight- 
forward narrative, devoid of either fulsome eulogy or 
a spirit of disputation. 

Professor William MacDonald's " Select Statutes 
and Other Documents Illustrative of the History of 
the United States, 1861-1898," published by the Mac- 
millan Co., supplements the author's volume of " Select 
Documents," covering the earlier period, in a highly 
satisfactory way. The number of papers given is one 
hundred and thirty-one, beginning with Lincoln's first 
call for volunteers, and ending with the Treaty of Paris. 
Teachers of American history will find this collection 
an invaluable adjunct to their work.

one-volume life of Napoleon, prepared by Mr. R. M. 
Johnston, recently appointed Austin Teaching Fellow

The " Tannhauser " metrical romance of Herr Julius 
Wolff, translated into English by Mr. Charles G. 
Kendall, makes a two-volume work now published in 
holiday guise by Mr. Richard G. Badger. 

" Sunshine and Love," compiled by Miss Katharine 
G. Spear, is a book of devotional prose, giving selections 
for every day in the year. It is prettily bound in limp 
leather, and published by Messrs. Jennings & Pye. 

Mr. William C. Sprague's "Napoleon Bonaparte," 
published by the A. Wessels Co., is a history written 
for boys, which presents the character of the imperial 
brigand in the popular, rather than the ethical light. 

Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, whose novel entitled 
" A Prince of Sinners " attracted attention last year, 
has written a new romance, " Anna, the Adventuress," 
which Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. will publish shortly. 

" Outlines of Greek History," by Professor William 
C. Morey, is a school text-book just published by the 
American Book Co. The book is topical in method, 
illustrated, and furnished with references for outside 
reading. 

Wycherley and Shadwell (the latter a new volume 
edited by Professor Saintsbury) have been added to the 
new thin-paper edition of the '• Mermaid Series " of 
English dramatists, now being imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons send us a third (author- 
ized) edition of " The Gentle Art of Making Enemies," 
by the late James McNeill Whistler. The entertaining 
book will doubtless find amused readers for many years 
to come. 

Herr Wilhelm Meyer-Forster's story of " Old Heidel- 
berg," upon which Mr, Richard Mansfield's latest popu- 
lar play is based, comes to us in an English translation 
by Mr. Max Chapelle, and is published by Messrs. 
Dodge & Metcalf. 

We have received Volume VII. of the " Publications 
of the Mississippi Historical Society," edited by Mr. 
Franklin L. Riley. It is a substantial octavo of more 
than five hundred pages, largely filled with original 
historical material. 

" Joseph and the Land of Egypt," by Professor A. H. 
Sayce, and " Joshua and the Palestinian Conquest," by 
Professor W. H. Bennett, are the latest volumes in the 
" Temple Series of Bible Handbooks " published by the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. 



Don Pedro A. de Alarcon's " El Nino de la Bola," 
edited by Mr. Rudolph Schwill, is a Spanish text just 
published by the American Book Co. The work is 
abridged to something like half its natural dimensions. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. send us the seventh 
edition, revised, of " Longmans's School Geography," by 
Messrs. George G. Chisholm and C. H. Leete. The 
work is in ordinary book form, with no maps but other 
illustrations in abundance. 

The first book of fiction to be brought out this year by 
the Lothrop Publishing Company will be "The Human 
Touch," a story of Western life. The author. Miss 
Edith K. NichoU, is an English woman,^a daughter of 
the late Dean of Westminster. 

An analysis of Tennyson's " In Memoriam," prepared 
by Mr. Charles Mansford, was printed privately for the 
use of the author's students some fifteen years ago. It 
is now given to the larger public by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co., who issue the work in a neat volume. 

The Delegates of the Clarendon Press are making 
arrangements for a thorough revision of Liddell and 
Scott's standard " Greek-English Lexicon," under the 
supervision of Mr. Arthur Sidgwick. They solicit con- 
tributions from scholars in the way of corrections or 
additions. 

Under the general title of " Unknown Heroes of the 
Navy," Mr. Edgar Stanton Maclay is preparing for the 
Baker & Taylor Co. a series that promises to possess 
considerable popular and historical interest. The first 
volume will be devoted to Moses Brown, a captain in 
our navy of the Revolution. 

Mr. Stephen Gwynn, author of "John Maxwell's 
Marriage," has finished his work on "Landmarks of 
Literature," and the Macmillan Co. will publish it within 
a few weeks. Later in the spring the same firm hopes 
to bring out Mr. Gwynn's life of Thomas Moore in the 
" English Men of Letters " series. 

A pamphlet imported by the Messrs. Scribner gives 
us " The Hundred Love Songs of Kamal Ad-Din of 
Ispahan," translated from the Persian by Mr. Louis H. 
Gray, and put into quatrains by Mrs. Ethel Watts 
Mumford. This is stated to be the first translation of 
the work into any occidental language. 

" On the Eve " and " Fathers and Children " are two 
volumes just added to the new subscription edition of 
Tourgu^nieff, published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. The translation is by Miss Hapgood, who also 
supplies an introduction to each novel. The frontis- 
piece illustrations are very happily conceived. 

Mr. Henry E. Krehbiel, the musical critic and lec- 
turer, has furnished an introduction to Kufferath's 
« Parsifal of Richard Wagner," which Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. announce for immediate publication. Mr. 
Krehbiel considers this "the best single help to the 
study of ' Parsifal ' with which I am acquainted." 

" A List of Books on the Philippine Islands in the 
Library of Congress," prepared by Mr. A. P. C. Griffin, 
is a recent volume sent us from the Government Print- 
ing Office. It includes references to periodicals, and a 
chronological list of maps compiled by Mr. P. Lee 
Phillips. The whole work makes a volume of four 
hundred pages. 

It is announced that the letters of John Ruskin to 
Charles Eliot Norton are to be published in two volumes 
next autumn by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and 
that, in the meantime, selected portions of this corre- 
spondence will appear in the " Atlantic Monthly." As 



128 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



is well known, Professor Norton was Ruskiu's most 
intimate friend in this country, and the letters are said 
to reveal a naore genial and pleasant side of Ruskin's 
personality than has been shown in any of his corres- 
pondence previously published. 

A text of "General Zoology," by Professor Charles 
Wright Dodge, is published by the American Book Co. 
The work is based upon Orton's " Comparative Zoology," 
one of the most successful of the older treatises upon 
the subject. The same publishers send us a volume of 
" Homeric Stories for Young Readers," retold in simple 
language by Professor Frederic Aldin Hall. 

An " Elementary Guide to Literary Criticism," by 
Professor F. V. N. Painter, is a recent school publica- 
tion of Messrs. Ginn & Co. The aim of the book " is 
to show the student what to look for in the study of 
any literary work." In other words, it is a practical 
rhetoric of an elementary sort, as well as an exposition 
of the elements of excellence in literary productions. 

" The Select Tennyson," edited by Mr. J. Logie 
Robertson, is a volume for school use and for private 
study published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
It includes many of the shorter poems, besides large 
parts of "The Princess" and "In Memoriam." The 
selections are all made from the poet's earlier work 
upon which copyright no longer exists. 

Volume IV. of the " American Art Annual," edited 
by Miss Florence N. Levy, is at hand. This useful 
publication has not been issued during the past two 
years, and so the present volume is really a review of 
the sales, exhibitions, publications, and reports of a 
period of three years. It also includes an index to the 
whole four volumes thus far published. 

" Pendennis " follows " Vanity Fair " in the new 
subscription edition of Thackeray which the Messrs. 
Scribner are engaged in publishing, and fills, like its 
predecessor, three of the thirty-two handsome volumes 
of which this set is to be made up. They are highly 
satisfactory volumes to look at and to handle, and we 
are tempted for their sake alone to read our Thackeray 
all over again. 

An interesting study of " The Philosophy of Ernest 
Renan," by Mr. Herman G. A. Brauer, is a doctoral 
thesis of the University of Wisconsin, and is published 
as a number in the " Philology and Literary Series " of 
that institution. To the " Engineering Series " of the 
University publications a brief paper on " The Progress 
of the Ceramic Industry," by Mr. Edward Orton, has 
just been added. 

The following German texts are sent us by the 
American Book Co: " German Composition," by Mr. 
B. Mack Dresden; " Bunte Geschichten fiir Unfanger," 
by Miss Emma M. Stoltze; a selection of Grimm's 
"Kinder- und Hausmarchen, edited by Professor B. J. 
Vos; and "Undine," edited by Professor J. Henry 
Senger. From Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. we have 
E. Werner's " Heimatklang," edited by Miss Marian 
P. Whitney. 

An undertaking of interest to lovers of fine book- 
making no less than to students of American history 
is announced by the University Press of Cambridge and 
Messrs. A. W. Elson & Co. of Boston, in conjunction. 
This is a series of " Monographs of the American Rev- 
olution," with a hitherto unpublished essay on Thomas 
Jefferson by the late Paul Leicester Ford as the first 
volume. The illustrations will form an important 
feature, consisting in the initial volume of two portraits 



of Jefferson, one an original signed etching by Mr. W. 
H. W. Bicknell and the other a photogravure, and a 
vignette etching of Monticello. The volume will be 
printed upon Imperial Japan paper, in an edition lim- 
ited to 500 copies. 

The publication of Mrs. Irene Grosvenor Wheelock's 
handbook to the " Birds of California " which has been 
postponed several times on account of the elaborate 
nature of its make-up, is now definitely announced for 
the latter part of this month. Mrs. Wheelock's book 
will no doubt take its place as the standard reference 
book on Pacific Coast ornithology. It has been lavishly 
illustrated by Mr. Bruce Horsfall. 

Four new volumes have come to us in the series of 
illustrated reprints published by Messrs. D. Appleton 
& Co. They are: " The Third Tour of Doctor Syntax 
in Search of a Wife," with Rowlandson's colored plates; 
"The National Sports of Great Britain," by Henry 
Aiken, with colored plates; Pierce Egan's " Life in 
London," with colored illustrations by the Cruikshanks; 
and Lover's " Handy Andy," with the author's illus- 
trations in black and white.

P1{INTET) BT THE 

1 HE success achieved by the 7{jverside Press 
Editions during the past four years has been so 
gratifyingjhat the Publishers have decided to 
enlarge the scope of the department. In doing 
so, they hope to meet the wishes of a great 
number of book-lovers by dividing these pub- 
lications into two classes. This was suggested 
by the fact that in sele^ing titles to appear in 
their I^verside Press Editions, they were fre- 
quently obliged to reject books because the sub- 
jects did not properly allow of an individual 
style of typographical treatment. Among the 
books thus passed over, however, are many of 
unusual interest, either bibliographical, his- 
torical, or occasional, whose contents deserve 
preservation in a fitting form. They will 
endeavor to give the further volumes of the 
I{iverside Press Editions that distinctive indi- 



TIIFERSIDE PRESS. 

viduality of format and that permanent value 
as examples of excellence in design and work- 
manship which book-lovers have appreciated 
in the books already issued. 

For the reprints of rare Americana, for bib- 
liographical volumes, and for those original 
works which may commend themselves for 
special publication, a treatment is proposed 
somewhat different from that of the I^iverside 
Press Editions. To these books, to be known as 
Special Limited Editions, the same expert su- 
pervision of make-up and manufacture will be 
given that I{iverside Press Editions receive. 

There will be but one edition of each work, 
strictly limited, of which the plates will be 
destroyed when the printing is completed. It 
is expected, furthermore, that the books will 
be offered at a comparatively moderate price.

THE STATE UNIVERSITY. 



The public university supported by taxation, 
and forming the keystone in the educational 
arch of the Commonwealth, offers one of the 
most familiar, and at the same time one of the 
most distinctive features of the American sys- 
tem. In our Western and Southern States, 
indeed, this part of the educational machinery 
is so taken for granted as both necessary and 
logical that we should find much difficulty in 
dismissing it from the terms of our thinking 
about educational matters. That the State uni- 
versity is the logical outcome of our national 
attitude toward education will be admitted with- 
out much argument. We believe it a para- 
mount duty of the State to provide for the free 
education of its citizens, and that principle 
once accepted, the question of how far public 
education shall be carried becomes one of mere 
expediency, of ways and means only, involving 
no fundamental principle whatever. It is ob- 
vious that the education provided at the publio 
charge should be the best that is demanded by 
intelligent opinion, the best that is justified by 
economic conditions. 

On the other hand, it is equally evident from 
our educational history that the public univer- 
sity is not necessary in the sense that we should 
have no higher education at all without it. 
That agency failing us, we should still have 
private institutions of learning, and these, if 
in unrestricted occupancy of the field, would 
undoubtedly be much more numerous than they 
now are, possibly numerous enough to make up 
fully for the failure of the community to recog- 
nize its higher responsibilities. The fact that 
a national ideal which leaves to private initia- 
tive so many matters fostered by government 
support in other countries has not been willing 
to leave this matter also to take care of itself 
offers convincing evidence of the seriousness 
with which we confront our duties in the edu- 
cational field. Hardly any other nation even 
now confronts those duties as seriously as we 
do ; no other nation has a record as long and 
consistent as ours for recognition of this solemn 
educational obligation of the State. 

The early history of college education in

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



America is not only interesting in itself, and 
even romantic at times, but it is also singularly 
instructive in the light which it throws upon 
the persistency of the national attitude toward 
education. Mr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown, the 
author of a recent publication of the Univer- 
sity of California, entitled " The Origin of 
American State Universities," has made an 
interesting study of the conditions surrounding 
the higher education in our early history, the 
influences that shaped our pioneer colleges, 
and the tendencies that at last resulted in the 
type of institution now known as the State 
university. It is the case with nations as well 
as individuals that ideals which eventually 
become distinctly defined originate in some 
semi-conscious impulse, and grope their way 
toward complete realization. This is notably 
the case with the American ideal of the higher 
public education, as Mr. Brown makes clear 
in the course of his investigation. That all 
education, the highest no less than the lowest, 
must be a matter of public concern, is a cor- 
ollary from the very principle of democracy, 
and the gradual establishment of this view 
in our polity is the subject of an important 
chapter in the history of our institutional evo- 
lution. 

The colonial period in America witnessed 
the foundation of nine colleges, of which the list 
is as follows: Harvard (1636), William and 
Mary(1693), Yale (1701), Princeton (1746), 
Pennsylvania (1753), King's, afterwards Co- 
lumbia (1754), Brown (1764), Queens, after- 
wards Rutgers (1766), and Dartmouth ( 1769). 
All were established primarily for the purpose 
of religious instruction ; but all showed early 
tendencies to escape from that limitation. Gen- 
erally speaking, these colleges, whatever the 
ecclesiastical organization for which they stood, 
were tolerant enough in their conditions of 
membership. Also generally speaking, they 
received from the State some measure of sup- 
port, either directly or indirectly — by money 
appropriations, land grants, exemption from 
taxation or permissive legislation in the matter 
of lotteries — and in return for these favors, 
the State claimed a certain degree of control 
over the colleges. As the period of the Rev- 
olution drew near, there came to be a growing 
consciousness on the part of the public that 
the colleges were somehow failing to respond 
to the needs of the commonwealth. They 
remained sectarian in management, and their 
close-corporation type of government prevented 



them from serving as representative agencies 
of a plastic society tending to shape itself upon 
lines more and more democratic. We conse- 
quently find that resolute attempts were made, 
beginning some time before the Revolution 
and extending many years beyond it, to enlarge 
the scope of governmental control, and to con- 
vert these essentially private corporations into 
quasi-public institutions. 

These attempts failed all along the line. 
They were particularly persistent, before the 
Revolution, in the cases of Yale and King's ; 
after the Revolution they were continued in 
these cases and several others, the movement 
receiving its couiJ de grace in 1819, when the 
adjudication of the Supreme Court, in the 
leading case of Dartmouth College, forever 
settled the long-vexed question. This case is 
chiefly famous because of its wide bearings, 
and because it enforced in unmistakable terms 
the Constitutional provision prohibiting a State 
from making any law impairing the obligation 
of contracts. In its educational significance, 
which alone concerns us here, it meant that the 
charters of the colonial colleges were not sub- 
ject to revison, in the sense of enlarged State 
control, by legislative enactment. Webster's 
masterly argument disposed of that question 
for good, and thus transformed the whole 
movement for making public institutions out 
of the existing colleges into a movement for 
the establishment of new institutions under 
the complete control of the State. 

The nearest colonial approach to a State 
university as we understand the expression was 
probably offered by Harvard in its earliest 
days. "Up to 1650," says Mr. Brown, "it 
was as nearly like a state university as the 
colony was like a modern state." But it lost 
much of this character after an amendment to 
the charter enlarged the powers of the Corpo- 
ration. We have seen how the attempts to 
make state institutions out of the other col- 
leges were marked by failure, although Penn- 
sylvania, Columbia, and Dartmouth " had each 
its brief term of service as a State institu- 
tion." Soon after the Revolution the movement 
for permanent State universities took definite 
shape, and the Southern States were the first 
to make such establishments. The legislature 
of North Carolina erected a State university in 
1789, and the legislature of South Carolina 
in 1801 followed the example thus set by its 
neighbors. In the Old Dominion, after re- 
peated attempts to transform the ancient foun-

dation of William and Mary bad been thwarted, 
the efforts of Thomas Jefferson to establish a 
true State institution came to fruition, and in 
1819, the year of the Dartmouth College de- 
cision, the University of Virginia entered upon 
its honorable and influential career. 

The chief opportunity, however, for the ex- 
ercise of this new governmental function first 
clearly recognized in the South was to be found 
in the new Northwest. Here was a field free 
for experiment, and unhampered by any insti- 
tutional inheritance. Congress had already 
prepared the way by providing the Territory 
with a fundamental law in the form of that 
great Ordinance which has been the Magna 
Charta of the liberties of five great common- 
wealths. Congress had also, in its character 
as universal landed proprietor, devoted to the 
educational purposes of the future a not incon- 
siderable fraction of the national domain. The 
history of State universities in the Northwest is 
not easy to present in simple outline, because 
of the gradual stages by which the several in- 
stitutions have come to their full growth. Ohio 
University was chartered in 1804, the year 
after the admission of the State, but it re- 
ceived no public support except from the Con- 
gressional grants of land. Ohio is thus in a 
way descredited educationally, in spite of its 
forty colleges (mostly small and sectarian), 
and in spite of the fact that in the University 
of Cincinnati it offers a pioneer example of 
the public city university which is bound to be 
one of the general educational developments 
of the future. Indiana and Illinois, which 
come next in the order of statehood, have 
done better. The University of the former 
commonwealth has a history beginning with 
the Indiana Seminary of 1820, and the Uni- 
versity of the sister State, growing out of the 
Industrial University chartered in 1867, has 
made up for its youth by its rapid recent de- 
velopment. 

It is to Michigan and Wisconsin, however, 
the last two States organized in the North- 
western Territory, that we must look for ex- 
amples of the American State university in its 
most typical form. These strongly- manned 
and generously-supported institutions, making 
their influence felt in every county and town 
of their respective States, have for the first 
time shown what higher education at the public 
charge may mean, and have thus set examples 
and served as models, not only for their less 
progressive neighbor-commonwealths, but also 



for nearly all the newer States of the West and 
Southwest, the States made out of the Louis- 
iana Purchase, the territory wrested from 
Mexico, and the Oregon country. Both Mich- 
igan and Wisconsin took the lead at the very 
start in the matter of public higher education, 
and have never had to contend against import- 
ant or richly-endowed private foundations. It 
was as early as 1817, long before Michigan 
became a State, that the territorial legislature 
called into being the " Catholepistemiad or 
University of Michigan," although the institu- 
tion, under its more chastened modern desig- 
nation, was not opened for students until a 
quarter of a century later. The founding of 
the University of Wisconsin dates from 1848, 
having been coincident with the creation of the 
State itself. The influence of these two great 
institutions upon the educational development 
of the West has been very marked. They have 
set the pace, as it were, for the institutions of 
similar type that have been organized during 
the last fifty years in a score or more of the 
Western and Southern States. They have also 
shown, for the first time, that the State univer- 
sity may be so liberally planned, and brought 
to so high a degree of efficiency, as fairly to 
rival the rich private foundations of an earlier 
day. 

The large endowments of the great private 
university corporations are doubtless imposing, 
but the potential endowment of a flourishing 
State university, backed by the public opinion 
of a populous commonwealth, should be found 
even more so. Not only does the " plant " 
exhibited at such places as Madison and Ann 
Arbor compare favorably in impressiveness 
with what may be seen at Ithaca or New Haven, 
but their regular annual appropriations, if 
capitalized, would represent totals of the same 
order of magnitude as those represented by 
the invested funds of the private corporations 
concerned in this comparison. And the pos- 
sibilities of growth, in the case of the State 
university, are not limited by the generosity 
of a few wealthy individuals, but are as bound- 
less as the wealth of the whole community. 
And even, as the University of California has 
recently shown us, the State institution may 
become the mark for private philanthropy as 
well as the object of public expenditure, thus 
uniting both sources of supply in a common 
beneficent aim. 

We have no idea that public competition in 
the matter of university education will ever 



140 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



force the private institutions out of existence. 
The experience of the last thirty years, marked 
as it is by such foundations as Johns Hopkins, 
Bryn Mawr, Clark, Stanford, and Chicago, 
makes it fairly evident that we shall have new 
private universities in increasing numbers. 
But the State establishments must henceforth 
be counted as worthy competitors in this field 
•of generous rivalry. In the course of time we 
«hall also have tax-supported colleges in our 
larger cities, for this must be the natural course 
of development of our city high schools. And 
all these institutions, public and private, will 
tend more and more to offer public service in 
the broadest sense, and to discourage all nar- 
row aims and antiquated methods. The only 
sufferers in this competition will be the insti- 
tutions that ought to suffer — those that offer 
an indignity to the very spirit of education by 
setting some form of sectarian teaching in the 
foreground of their activities, those that do not 
encourage the most absolute freedom of teach- 
ing and investigation, those that remain so hide- 
bound in tradition as to be unable to adapt 
themselves to the ever-changing and ever-broad- 
ening demands of an advancing civilization. 
In this light, we may await without alarm the 
survival of the fittest among educational types, 
and view without a pang the disappearance of 
those that are based upon prejudice and con- 
secrated to outworn creeds. 

There is evidence upon every hand that we 
are now in a -fair way of approach toward the 
realization of the principle " that no sort of 
higher education can possibly be a merely 
private concern," that all the types of univer- 
sity management " are leading up to the one 
type of American university, which is that of 
an institution ministering liberally and con- 
stantly to the higher life of the people and of 
all the people." These words of our author 
are enforced by a series of striking quotations 
from Governor Livingston of New York, one 
of the most enlightened educational thinkers 
of the eighteenth century. It would not be 
easy to improve upon the following programme, 
which was framed by Livingston exactly a cen- 
tury and a half ago : 

" The true use of education is to qualify men for the 
different employments of life to which it may please 
God to call them. 'Tis to improve their hearts and 
understandings, to infuse a public spirit and love of 
their Country; to inspire them with the principles of 
honor and probity ; with a fervent zeal for liberty, and 
a diffusive benevolence for mankind; and in a word, to 
make them more extensively serviceable to the Com- 
monwealth." 



WALTER PATER IN PERSPECTIVE. 

In these days of abbreviations and brusqueness, 
when the diction and manners of shop-girls and 
political rings penetrate even college circles, when 
f eve people take time for the formalities and graces 
that dignify and beautify social intercourse, vre 
rejoice that a new biography, a reprint of his here- 
tofore uncollected essays, and another edition of 
" Marius the Epicurean," turn our attention once 
more to Walter Pater. He appears like a courte- 
ous gentleman of the old school. Coarseness and 
slanginess did not seem to him necessary concom- 
itants of virility. He is not a mere stylist : most, 
of the critical judgments in his works on "The 
Renaissance" and "Plato and Platonism" are 
sound, and the scholarship evinced in " Marius the 
Epicurean " is genuine and broad ; yet nothing of 
haste or shoddiness mars his thought or its expres- 
sion. That he lived "unspotted from the world," 
his life, his love of truth and beauty, and his per- 
sonal charm, all indicate. 

We know Pater, not from outward life and posi- 
tion, but from his inward experiences, embodied in 
pages where thoughtful heroes — Marius, Gaston, 
Sabastian, Emerald Uthwart, and the rest — pace 
with stately mein. Still, it may be interesting to 
recall that, born in London in 1839, of Catholic 
parents, he was descended from Watteau's pupil 
Pater, — for, as one stands before the small pictures 
of Pater, the eighteenth-century French artist in 
the collection La Caze in the Louvre to-day, he 
sees the origin of some of the English critic's love 
of delicate colors and restful charm. When twenty- 
two years old. Pater was graduated from Queen's 
College, Oxford, and placed by the examiners in 
the second class, where Matthew Arnold's name 
stood eighteen years before. After becoming Fel- 
low of Brasenose in 1865, he never severed his con- 
nection with that college, being always a lecturer, 
and eventually dean. But even if the setting of 
his life plays little part in our knowledge of him, 
we are glad to hear from Mr. Gosse and Mr. Sharpe 
that he was a pale-faced, thick-set man, walking 
heavUy, almost as if lame, fond of young people as 
well as of golden light, — though we almost knew 
beforehand that his rooms, furnished in blue, were 
characterized by "delicate austerity," and feel as 
though we had already seen the Wedgewood vase 
full of flowers standing against the soft yellow wall- 
paper, the two bronze ornaments of fine Italian work- 
manship, and the Lucca della Robbia Madonna on 
his walls. Nor are we surprised that the creator 
of the sensitive Marius did not enjoy walking under 
an overhanging rock, that snakes disturbed his calm, 
that the fragrance of white jonquil and syringa 
almost gave him pain, while meadow-sweet brought 
a sudden "fugitive sense of distant pastures and 
twilight eves and remote scattered hamlets." 

Yet, well as we know this quiet Oxford writer, 
we are ahnost at a loss with whom to compare him.

In English letters, his eight volumes of criticism and 
imaginary portraits stand alone, suggesting neither 
predecessor nor contempoi'ary. Still, it may not. be 
too strained to discover resemblances between his 
spirit and that of the fifteenth century Florentine 
painter, Sandro Botticelli. Perhaps in comparing 
the two we must eliminate from Botticelli something 
of his quaintness. Yet, as Bacon says, "There is 
no excellent art that hath not some strangeness in 
the proportion," and our sense of meeting an old- 
fashioned gentleman, when we see Pater, may be a 
lesser degree of the feeling with which we survey 
the figured gowns and oddly imagined flowers in 
Botticelli's pictures. Naturally, they share those 
primal attributes, the final test of an artist's genu- 
ineness, — reverence for truth, and supreme care for 
beauty as its only complete expression; attributes 
so mixed that each was both philosopher, grasping 
firmly fundamental principles, and artist, infinitely 
interested in details of form. Botticelli writes a 
commentary on the Divine Comedy, yet rarely fails 
to wreathe the roses or coil the silken scarfs about 
his angels' heads. And Pater, interpreter of Plato, 
so demands beautiful words that his caricature is 
the heartless Mr. Rose, cold devotee of art for art's 
sake, walking through the pages of Mallock's "New 
Republic." So united in both men is the love of 
ideas and a sense of concrete images, that each is 
kin to Pater's contemplative Marius, to whom, with 
all his abstract speculation, the word " home " must 
always have presented a pale red-and-yellow marble 
house, " with two centuries of sea-wind in the velvet 
of the mosses, along its inaccessible ledges," where 
the small glazed windows framed " the pallid crags 
of Carrara like wildly twisted snow-drifts above the 
purple heaths." Moreover, because of their devo- 
tion to truth and beauty, both take unusual pains 
in their task of pressing thought and feeling into 
form, — as a result of which carefulness, the work 
exhibits singular freedom from exaggeration, a 
kind of disciplined restraint. That this seeming 
passivity expresses reserve power and not weakness, 
Botticelli's " Calumny," — so full of vehement im- 
petuosity that even the statues in their niches join 
the action, — and the strong human tragedy of 
Emerald Uthwart, testify. 

However, not simply the common property of 
artists, but more special individual traits, do Pater 
and Botticelli hold in common. Like his hero 
Marius, Pater's " first boyish sense of priesthood, 
the sense of dedication," survived, and so strength- 
ened that at the time of his death he contemplated 
taking orders ; and we read that Botticelli, turning 
from his painting, became a follower of Savonarola, 
although the stern Monk of San Marco doubtless 
thought the artist's Venus only fit for burning on 
the Pile of Vanities. The world of neither reveals 
the child's certain God, at hand to ward off evil 
giants in the dark. 

But if theirs is the maturer insight that knows 
the difference between faith and knowledge, they 
respond no less fully to the divine suggestiveness 



of common things, — the faint shadows of pigeons 
against a white wall, moving heads of golden grain 
beneath the wind, the curve of the green wave be- 
fore it breaks. For each, too, the world had lost 
something of its careless, primitive blitheness. As 
a rule, the Greeks emphasized the type, and rested 
happy in their sense of Nature's stability. Did not 
the Homeric sea forever wash the bases of moun- 
tains, the purple clusters and green olives return 
each year? and were not the soft cream Doric 
columns prominent against the sky's deep blue, 
friendly to the laws of Zeus, and to be depended 
upon as Mother Demeter herself ? Not permanent 
types, but changing individuals, compose the world 
of Pater and Botticelli ; men and women wounded, 
like Amf ortas with the Saviour's spear, from which 
they blindly shrink. The fleetingness of life, its 
wistful vistas and sad mysteries, are a large part 
of their conception ; and whether it be the " cer- 
tain fresh way " the leaves of Florian's poplar 
have of " dealing with the wind, making it sound 
in never so slight a stirring of the air like rvm- 
ning water," or Marius's " upright stone, still with 
mouldering garlands about it," marking the heaven- 
touched spot where the lightning had struck dead 
the ancient laborer, whether it be the limpness of 
the Madonna's hold upon her baby, or the droop- 
ing head of the Spring Goddess, their lovely images 
usually border the fountains of tears. 

Born of their conception of individuals, in ever- 
changing relations, a sensitiveness to the compro- 
mises that knit the universe together distinguishes 
both men. Botticelli, as Pater himself suggests, is 
interested neither in Paradise nor Inferno, but in 
the great middle-world between the two. All of 
his angels have a human look. On every page of 
Pater lie subtle distinctions, the blending shades 
always spanning the spaces between black and 
white. It is the modern relative spirit. No tinge 
of the coldness of the partisan toward all but the 
favorite truth lingers in him, none of the bitter- 
ness of the cynic, no trace of the metallic imper- 
viousness of the dogmatist to whatever contradicts 
his theory. Whether we read his delineation of 
Gaston de Latour, perceptibly incorporating the 
form and color of the Chartres Cathedral ; or of 
Watteau, the court painter, cherishing his lovely 
dreams amid sordid actualities ; whether he tells 
us that we come to Michael Angelo's figures in the 
Sacristy of San Lorenzo, "for solemnity, for dignity 
of impression perhaps, but not for consolation," 
or defines the qualities of style as mind and soul, 
"reasonable structure " and " color and mystic per- 
fume," we feel his to be the " intellectual finesse " 
and "tender and delicate justice in the criticism of 
human life " of which he writes. 

Indeed, Pater and Botticelli always possess to a 
large degree that of which they treat. That is, both 
men illustrate Maeterlinck's saying, "nothing be- 
falls us that is not of the nature of ourselves." The 
subjectivity of Botticelli's ideal of beauty makes his 
Madonna and his Venus twin sisters. And in spite 



tm 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



of Pater's singular catholicity of sympathy, furnish- 
ing him insight into lives dissimilar as Winkelman's 
and Wordsworth's, Plato's and Lucca della Rohbia's, 
he usually detects in his object certain qualities of 
feeling his own soul knows : in Charles Lamb, a dis- 
interested practice of literature, treatment of prose 
style as an art, and criticism as appreciation ; in 
Rossetti, a "sustained impressibility toward the mys- 
terious conditions of man's everyday life," giving 
"a singular gravity to all his work"; in Raphael, 
a power of painstaking and joining of the philoso- 
pher's mind to the artist's hand. In his "Imaginary 
Portraits " this subjectivity is even more conscious. 
Pater is our comrade, whatever the time or place, 
— whether we enter with Marius the presence of 
Marcus Aurelius, skate with Sabastian Van Stork 
in an Ostade landscape, or, enclosed by bare white 
walls, dream with Emerald Uthwart of the rose per- 
fumes of his mother's garden. 

But Pater and Botticelli resemble one another 
not merely in their union of philosophic and ar- 
tistic susceptibilities, in their sense of the shadow 
of change upon men's faces, in their belief in the 
relativity of truth, and in their subjective tempera- 
ment ; nor is it these characteristics chiefly that 
endear them to the hearts of their lovers. There 
is also that ever midefined quality which we call 
"charm," for they both belong to that group of 
artists who, as Pater says, " have a distinct faculty 
of their own by which they convey to us a peculiar 
quality of pleasure." In each we find a "profound 
expressiveness," that " seal " upon his work " of 
what is most inward and peculiar in his moods and 
manner of apprehension." This charm, this per- 
sonality, sounding gently through the mask of form, 
lives in the lines of Botticelli's angels' feet, his 
fluted shells and spiral candles, the curved limbs of 
his Graces beneath their diaphanous draperies, the 
leafy decorations of his PaUas. And hardly less is 
it visible in the turns of Pater's sinuous sentences, 
his favorite images, his delight in participles and 
words in "ness," touching with strangeness and 
wistfulness, loveliness and expressiveness, his style, 
marking it ever with the " intimate impress of an 
indwelling soul." 

Nevertheless, for all his charm, Pater's genuine 
audience never wUl be large. He has neither ex- 
horted men to act, nor chosen themes of universal 
interest. The very delicacy of his discernment and 
the exquisite nicety of his expression involve a want 
of incisiveness in his style, so that his thoughts slide 
smoothly over inattentive, weary, or unsympathetic 
readers, leaving little mark. In addition to this de- 
ficiency of emphasis, his style lacks that most pop- 
ular literary excellence, — the chief nerve of epic, 
novel, and drama, — motion. It is the smooth- 
surfaced lake reflecting perfectly calm trees, shining 
reeds, and cloud-crossed sky, not the on-rushing 
stream sweeping aU before it ; and so dull and rest- 
less is the human mind that placidity, however 
beautiful, soon wearies most men. Yet such is the 
law of compensation, that to some writers, of genius 



neither the greatest nor the most popular, is meeded 
by their comparatively few intimates a share of love 
inordinately large. So, although Pater's are neither 
the unmeasured heights of the Shakespeares and Mil- 
tons, nor the foot-hills of the Macaulays and Longf el- 
lows peopled with crowds, perhaps a few, untempted 
by the loftiest peaks, and shunning the swarming 
lesser ridges, always maybe found on his unassuming 
summit, calmed by the charming vistas of his broad 
and quiet view. Mary Eleanor Barrows. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



BRYANT'S INDEX EXPURQATORIUS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The list of forbidden words and phrases prepared by 
William CuUen Bryant for the guidance of his subor- 
dinates on the New York Evening Post has often been 
reprinted as law and gospel for those that would speak 
and write correctly. A few itenas have been dropped, 
having passed into good usage since Bryant's time, I 
wish to draw my pen through a few more, hoping others 
will follow my example, until the cancellation becomes 
too broad and black to be erased. 

First, the prepositions " over " and " above " are for- 
bidden in the sense of " more than." I may, it appears, 
call myself under ninety, but not over eighty; I may 
count from one up to one hundred; I may speak of the 
higher numbers and the lower numbers; but I must not, 
80 far as the interdicted prepositions are concerned, 
conceive of my numeration as ascending. I rebel. 
The usage is convenient and time-saving. In case of 
any possible ambiguity, I will cheerfully use the circum- 
locution "more than"; but where no such misunder- 
standing is possible I choose the shorter form. The 
Germans have adopted an exactly analagous usage with- 
out fear and without reproach. Furthermore, see I. Cor. 
XV. 6. " He was seen of above five hundred brethren." 

More briefly, I wish to defend the use of " reliable." 
Its formation is illogical, it is true; but so is that of 
some words similarly formed and now in good and 
regular standing, as laughable, indispensable, unaccount- 
able, available, objectionable, perishable, marriageable. 
The purist must yield here to the claims of convenience 
and custom. Again, why such an outcry against the 
word " deceased " ? Used both participially and sub- 
stantively, it fills a gap. Shakespeare did not scruple 
to write, " this gentleman . . . deceased as he was 
born." Another forbidden word is " standpoint." But 
we now have good authority for its use. If our Teu- 
tonic cousins may regard a thing from their standpunct, 
why may not we from ours? " Endorse," in the sense 
of " approve " is also on the list. Is it because of its too 
vivid suggestions of commerce and bill-brokerage? Yet 
all terms, however abstract, had once their concrete 
meaning. Moreover, we find the word in this derived 
sense as far back as Sir Thomas More. " Day before 
yesterday " is put under the ban. We are told to say 
"the day before yesterday." This is finical. The 
article was made for man, not man for the article. 

Finally, Mr. Editor, with all due respect for the de- 
ceased, I hope over ten thousand of your readers will 
endorse my opinion and adopt my standpoiat in regard- 
ing Bryant's strictures as no longer wholly reliable.

Armstrong and the Hampton School..* 



The race question, like poverty, we have 
always with us ; but never has so much and 
80 intelligent thought been given to it as now. 
Dealing historically and practically with our 
negro problem, and more briefly with the In- 
dian question, Mrs. Talbot's life of her father, 
General Armstrong, is instructive as well as 
interesting. From Armstrong himself, and 
later from his distinguished pupil at Tuskegee, 
we have learned the only hopeful method of 
dealing with our inferior races ; and this book 
emphasizes and illustrates the doctrines held 
by these men. But, turning a little aside from 
such weighty matters, let us direct our atten- 
tion more especially to the inspiring person- 
ality of the founder of the Hampton school. 
The tardy appearance of his biography, eleven 
years after his death, is probably owing to his 
express request that no life of him should be 
written. Yet the author thinks now, in view of 
the good influence such a book cannot fail to 
exert, that he would not raise unreasonable ob- 
jections to its publication. 

Samuel Chapman Armstrong was fortunate 
in his parentage and in the scene of his birth. 
His father was of Scotch-Irish extraction, his 
mother a Massachusetts woman, and he was 
born on the island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands, 
where his father was settled as a missionary. 
The fine climate and noble scenery of that 
beautiful archipelago, together with the best 
of home influences, were favorable to healthy 
physical, mental, and moral development ; and 
when the young man made his way to Williams 
College and the lecture room of Mark Hopkins, 
he was well equipped for the position of leader- 
ship he so easily and naturally assumed. Gen- 
ius, as Mr. Barrie has defined it, is the power 
to be a boy again at will. Armstrong never 
outgrew or wished to outgrow the boy that was 
in him, and it was the rollicking effervescence 
of youthful spirits that carried him triumph- 
antly over obstacles which others called insur- 
mountable. But before coming to these a few 
words of his descriptive of Hawaiian life must 
be given. He was one of eight children, the 
family resources were small, and he early 
learned the meaning of hard work. At school

— the Royal School at Punahou — Kalakaua 
and Liliuokalani, afterward king and queen, 
were among his playmates. Here is his de- 
scription of the Kawaiahao church, where his 
father preached to 2600 people who swarmed 
to hear him from miles around. 

"Outside it was like an encampment; inside it was 
a sea of dusky faces. On one side was the King's 
pew, with scarlet hangings; the royal family always 
distinguishing themselves by coming in very late, with 
the loudest of squeaking shoes. The more the shoes 
squeaked the better was the wearer pleased, and often 
a man, after walking noisily in, would sit down and 
pass his shoes through the window for his wife to wear 
in, thus doubling the family glory. Non-musical shoes 
were hardly salable." 

So well did the youth profit by such school- 
ing as was available that he was able at twenty- 
one to enter the junior class (the class of 1862) 
at Williams. For to this college, the birth- 
place of the foreign mission movement, his 
father naturally sent him. After a few months 
of dormitory experience in old East College, 
he was invited to share a room with the 
president's son Archibald. This admission to 
Dr. Hopkins's family circle was of advantage 
to the young man in more ways than one. En- 
joying the best of social influences, he kept 
clear of secret societies, relying on his own un- 
aided merits for making friends. " When one 
joins a secret society," he writes in one of his 
letters home, " all in it are his sworn friends, 
right or wrong ; this is childish." It was the 
influence and teaching of Dr. Hopkins, the 
recognized leader in his department of instruc- 
tion, that young Armstrong valued most in his 
college course. Years afterward we find him 
teaching mental and moral philosophy to his 
dark-skinned pupils at Hampton, and using his 
old teacher's " Outline Study of Man " for a 
textbook. 

As soon as he was out of college, in the 
summer of 1862, he joined the army as a vol- 
unteer, raising a company at Troy for Colonel 
Willard's regiment, the 125th New York. 
Being, however, an alien by birth, he did not 
heartily espouse the Union cause until the 
Emancipation Proclamation brought home to 
him what he was really fighting for. But even 
as an abolitionist he was at first rather luke- 
warm. As he expressed it at the time, — 
« I am a sort of abolitionist, but I hav n't learned to 
love the Negro. I believe in universal freedom, I be- 
lieve the whole world cannot buy a single soul. The 
Almighty has set, or rather limited, the price of one 
man, and until worlds can be paid for a single Negro I 
do n't believe in selling or buying them. I go in, then^ 
for freeing them more on account of their souls than

their bodies, I assure you. . . . The Union is to me 
little or nothing. I see no great principle necessarily 
involved in it. I see only the 4,000,000 slaves, and for 
and with them I fight." 

It was not until he became lieutenant-colonel, 
and afterward colonel, of a colored regiment, 
that he thoroughly warmed to his work, though 
from the first he was conspicuous for his brav- 
ery, his command of his men, and his bold ini- 
tiative. Gettysburg was the only great battle 
•he had the good fortune to take part in, and 
•here he rendered brilliant service at a most 
•critical moment. But the war ended before 
he had found the opportunity he longed for to 
iprove beyond question the valor and effect- 
iveness of negro soldiers. With the title of 
brevet brigadier-general, Armstrong retired to 
private life at the age of twenty-seven. 

But he was not long to remain in idleness. 
Seeking work in the newly-established Freed- 
men's Bureau, he was appointed agent for ten 
counties in Virginia and school superintendent 
of a large and loosely defined area. The educa- 
tional needs of the negro soon engrossed his 
attention, and, with the support and encourage- 
ment of the American Missionary Association 
in the spring of 1868, he started his school at 
Hampton, the first vigorous and successful 
attempt at industrial training in the country. 
This, too, was in the face of the discouraging 
results attained at Oberlin in combining agri- 
culture with book-learning. The story of the 
long fight for success at Hampton, the repeated 
begging excursions to the north and west, the 
concert tours of negro students to " sing up " 
some needed school building, the reception of 
a squad of Indian pupils in 1878, and the mas- 
terly methods employed for making the red- 
skins learn industry from their African asso- 
ciates, — all this must be got from the book 
itself. At intervals we catch a characteristic 
glimpse of the man Armstrong in his most 
pleasingly human aspect. He had early been 
led to look forward to the ministry as his 
destined calling, but something in him pro- 
tested against pulpit-pounding for a life-work. 
It was peculiarly distasteful to him to pray in 
public. A scrap here and there from his let- 
ters reveals his state of mind. In 1865 he 
writes : 

" When a meeting-house burns up I care very little; 
under the trees it is better — under the evening sky as 
the sun goes down in glory (as we worship) is the 
grandest time and place for it. I am terribly down on 
two sermons every Sunday. The drawing-out process 
is the best and truest. Set the people to work and the 
ministers to chewing tobacco if necessary to make them 



like other men, not still and mannerish, but open, free, 
hearty and happy. A good hearty, healthy laugh is as 
bad for the devil as some of the long nasal prayers I 
have heard — yes, worse. There is religion in music, 
in the opera. . . . Ministers say the opera is bad; I 
find religion there. They say to walk or ride out on 
Sunday is wicked. My bethel is by the seashore; there 
the natural language of my heart is prayer. So of the 
mountains." 

Strictly orthodox himself in the essentials 
of creed, and insisting that his school should 
be known as unswervingly orthodox, he yet 
was broad-minded enough to see that no church 
has a monopoly of truth. The American Mis- 
sionary Association was troubled with scruples 
about receiving aid for the Hampton school 
from unorthodox sources. But Armstrong let 
no such considerations disturb him ; and, as a 
matter of fact, a large part of his revenue for 
many years came from philanthropic Unitari- 
ans. " When it comes to the scratch," he 
declares in his outspoken way, " I believe in 
the prayers of the unorthodox — why are they 
not as effectual as any ? " In truth he was 
forced to neglect no possible means of raising 
money in his life-and-death struggle for pecun- 
iary support. This was of course a ruinously 
expensive method of carrying on his work ; it 
so sapped his vitality that he died when he 
should have been in the prime of life, at the 
age of fifty-four. Listen to his own account 
of the way he "drove things," under highest 
pressure, as long as strength was left him : 

" It is hard — this begging; it takes all one's nervous 
and physical strength, even when people are kind and 
polite, as they generally are. It is never and never can 
be easy, and I have always to use all my strength, fire 
every gun in order to bring to the hurried, worried busi- 
ness men that powerful influence that alone can secure 
money in a place like Boston, where for every dollar 
that even the richest are able to give there are ten 
chances to put it to good use and twenty demands for 
it from one source or another. It is amazing how hard 
is the pressure of appeal and yet how polite and good- 
natured most people are, how patiently they listen and 
how many give up their last spare dollar not needed for 
personal comfort. Boston has been educated to giving 
and gives splendidly. But thousands are turned away 
— few succeed, many fail who try for money, just as 
in the business world. In all this howling appeal and 
fearful competition of charities I have been making the 
best fight I could." 

It is worthy of note that he found hard times 
to have little effect on men when appeal was 
made for charity. In seasons of prosperity 
their hearts were hardened rather than moved 
to benevolence. The pinch of poverty seemed 
necessary to generate sympathy for others' 
needs. Among the cheering notes of the book 
is the expressed conviction of this educator of

negroes that the granting of suffrage to the 
colored man has not been a mistake. Had we 
first waited for the negro's education and eleva- 
tion, we should have waited indefinitely; the 
Southern whites would have blocked his way 
to the schoolhouse. The consciousness of being 
entitled to vote is a stimulus to the voter to 
make himself worthy of his citizenship. 

Dwelling a moment on the man as seen by 
his friends, let us take a look at General Arm- 
strong through the eyes of one at whose hearth 
he felt most at home. 

" He talked little of his work unless asked directly 
about it. He caught up any topic that was touched 
upon and tossed the ball of conversation most nimbly 
to and fro. A delightful gaiety is my most general 
recollection. There were serious moments when he 
rose to very great heights of simplicity and insight. . . . 
One felt the whole striving of the man toward a goal 
he revered. But geniality, wit, humanity, all these 
showed in his speech, and when he came in it was always 
as if a wind of strength and healing blew. I never saw 
him discouraged or downcast, even when things seemed 
very doubtful. I remember his telling me once about 
a college mate he had just seen who had grown sud- 
denly very rich, and spreading his hands, he said, 
* These are all there is between my little girls and the 
world,' and then he threw back his head and gave a 
most boyish laugh. 'And that's the way I like it!* 
He was often brilliant, always delightful, even when we 
knew he was tired and suffering. . . . He told delight- 
ful stories to my children, and no one ever went away 
from him without strength and fresh hope." 

Bravely he lived and bravely died, sticking 
to his post of duty to the last. He was buried 
at his own request " in the school graveyard, 
among the students, where one of them would 
have been put had he died next." His por- 
traits — ten of them are in this book — are 
especially interesting as showing how truly in 
his case the child was father of the man. Of 
him, if of anyone, it can aptly be said that 
his days were "bound each to each by natural 
piety." Perct F. Bicknell. 



An Epic of Quekn Bess.* 

Kuskin in his old age seriously complained 
that if he had not wasted his time on art he 
might have been the first geologist of Europe. 
Probably he was right. Geikie in his great work 
on Geology quotes passage after passage from 
the "Modern Painters." The part of that 
work which is the surest to live is the part 
devoted to the laws of growth and structure in 
earth and its belongings. The art critic is at

his best when he recognizes and reveals nature's 
artistry in her foreground pictures of grass and 
flower and tree, in her architectures of moun- 
tain, in her floating poems of cloud. Yet 
Kuskin's very great and minute knowledge of 
what would ordinarily be classed as scientific 
facts did not impede or imperil his poetic sense. 
Rather it was fuel that fed his fire of creative 
criticism. 

One of the first of American geologists has 
now come forward with a theory and a proof 
that the scientific instinct and training are not 
opposed to poetic feeling and power — that they 
are rather allied and spring from one root. In 
a modest and ingenuous preface to his immense 
dramatic romance, " Elizabeth of England," 
Mr. N. S. Shaler states that he began the work 
as an experiment to see how far he had retained 
his early feeling for literature after many years 
of absorption in science. He regrets that science 
should make its votaries indifferent to the higher 
forms of literature, and denies the necessity for 
it. He goes further, and claims that the scien- 
tific and the poetic mind work with the same 
materials and largely with the same methods. 
And in testimony thereof he lays before us his 
five-volumed poem. 

This is well I This is very well ! The loss 
which poetry has sustained in modern times 
has not been the loss of the world — its hold 
upon that was always precarious ; it has been 
the loss of the great minds of thd age, so many 
of whom have withdrawn into science and have 
treated the claims of literature with bitter skep- 
ticism. If poetry can win them back it will 
win the world readily enough. Poets have 
always been willing to claim all knowledge for 
their share. Plato, the most poetical of philos- 
ophers, placed over his school the inscription 
that only through mathematics could anyone 
enter there. Dante knew the whole science of 
his age as did Goethe of his. The antagonism 
has been on the side of the men of science. 
Their supposed facts, their supposed laws, their 
supposed exact knowledge have made them deaf 
and blind to the music and the picture which 
body forth the real meanings of the world. 
Just at present, when many of their supposi- 
tions are beginning to crumble beneath them, 
literature, which builds more truthfully and 
permanently than science, may have a chance 
to come into its own. 

So much for the thesis of faith which Mr. 
Shaler has nailed to the door of his huge cathe- 
dral of verse. Important as this declaration 
is, it must not detain us, for we have the poem 



146 



THE DIAL 



[March 1^ 



itself to deal with, and that can hardly be done 
in a brief critical article. We may say at once 
that it seems to us one of the largest and noblest 
works in pure literature which has appeared 
in many a day. 

Throwing historic accuracy aside, Mr. Shaler 
has recreated and interpreted a great historic 
epoch. He treats history as the best of the 
romance writers, Scott and Dumas, have done. 
But as far as his main figure and motive are 
concerned he is more delicate in insight, more 
profound in conception than they, — and his 
instrument of expression, his ringing, manly 
verse, yields him effects which stir the blood 
and rouse the emotions of the reader beyond 
anything that prose can do. 

The central idea of Mr. Shaler's whole work 
is Elizabeth's devotion to England. In the 
first play she betroths herself to her people, 
takes as a lover and a spouse the realm she 
is to rule. In the latter plays she is shown 
brooding like a mother over her subjects — 
nobles, knights, and common men. Nothing 
is allowed to interfere with her task in shaping 
their destinies. Courtiers, counsellors, lovers 
come to her and she tests them all, and rewards 
or sends them to the Tower or the block, — 
solely as they show their ability and willingness 
to aid her in making England great. Eliza- 
beth and England — these are the two person- 
ages of this epic drama. The many figures 
who fill in the scenes and who are drawn in 
many differing planes of reality and unreality, 
are merely the go-betweens, abettors or oppo- 
nents of that mighty passion. 

It is obvious that Mr. Shaler is one of those 
poets who work from within outwards, whose 
poems are moulded by the idea — not allowed 
to spring up from the life of the world. He 
is a Schiller rather than a Goethe. A slight 
comparison of his Elizabeth with the Queen 
Bess of Sir Walter Scott will suffice to show 
this. Scott's Elizabeth is a daylight Elizabeth, 
the stout-hearted but very worldly-minded 
daughter of Bluff King Hal. Mr. Shaler's 
Queen is an Elizabeth of the dark and the 
depths. She is always keyed to tragic intensity 
of purpose, or hovering on the verge of hyster- 
ical breakdown. She is never vulgar and never 
scandalous. The crimes she commits are for 
the good of England, and she pays for them 
with an agony of remorse which the real Queen 
would have scoffed at. She is a morbid Eliza- 
beth, an Elizabeth with nerves, who ought to 
go under treatment to a modern specialist. 
Mr. Shaler represents her always at concert 



pitch of emotion, always as planning by herself 
or with Cecil to save or shape England. May 
we be forgiven the comparison, but as scene 
after scene, play after play unfolds the same 
situation, England in danger and Elizabeth to 
the rescue, we are a little reminded of Mr. 
Micawber and his wife rushing into each other's 
arms and swearing eternal fidelity. The mas- 
ters are not thus monotonous. Achilles is not 
always shouting in the trench. He takes his 
ease in his tent with his friends and his female 
captives, and consumes huge shins of beef at 
banquet with the other chiefs. Hamlet is not 
always brooding on the infinite. He talks to 
the players, chaffs Polonius, and wooes Ophelia. 
Mr. Shaler seems to have been conscious of the 
want of relief, which, in his first four plays 
makes for us such a gloomy picture of Merry 
England, and in the final drama of the series 
he tries to set this to rights by bringing before 
us a long succession of pastoral pictures of the 
realm that Elizabeth has saved. The intention 
at least is admirable, but the tragic note re- 
turns and the scene closes with Elizabeth the 
Woman going down in utter wreck, destroyed 
by Elizabeth the Queen. 

Granting Mr. Shaler's right to use his ma- 
terials as he pleases, there can be no questioning 
the artistic effect of his picture of the epoch 
or the power in his presentation of its central 
figure. On the first reading, his book is com- 
pelling, almost overwhelming. He sweeps us 
along much as he wills. His own sympathy 
with nobleness is so great that again and again 
he brings us to tears by his presentation of 
utter loftiness of purpose or utter heroism of 
act. It is only when we begin to reflect and 
criticize that we feel the lack of flesh and blood 
in his creations. 

The form in which Mr. Shaler has cast his 
work raises the old question of the legiti- 
macy of the epic drama as a form of art. As 
Matthew Arnold pointed out, the categories of 
art forms which the Greeks left us — epic,, 
tragedy, comedy, lyric, and the like — cannot 
easily be bettered. To mix two of them is to 
produce a bastard form which will probably 
be weaker than either of the originals. Mr» 
Shaler's dramas are hardly plays, the whole 
work is hardly an epic, and the mixture results 
in weakness in the scenic arrangement and 
the characters themselves. Take the figure of 
Essex in the fourth play of the series. It is 
splendidly conceived, but it is not realized 
in either an epic or dramatic way. He is de- 
scribed infinitely, everybody talks about him^ 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



147 



he talks about himself, but he is not set on his 
legs to do anything, at least until the very last. 
Or take the scenes where the Queen views 
from the ramparts of Dover Castle the de- 
struction of the Armada. It is a fine epic 
situation, finer than Helen's view of the hosts 
from the walls of Troy. But Homer soon sends 
his heroine away and plunges into the real busi- 
ness of the poem, the hand-to-hand fighting. 
There is nothing but reflex action in Mr. 
Shaler's piece. The light of the burning Span- 
ish ships is reflected on Elizabeth's face, and 
the heroism of her fleets and of Gait, in whom 
is, for the moment, embodied the might of En- 
gland, are merely described to her by messen- 
gers. However, the question whether all this 
is not right enough and good enough, whether 
the epic drama has not won its place as a new 
art genre^ is still open. Mr. Shaler has plenty 
of modern precedents — the works of Charles 
Wells, Sir Henry Taylor, Mr. Swinburne, and 
others. 

Mr. Shaler's first piece, "The Coronation," 
comes nearer to being a true play than any of 
the others. It has a central motive, fantastic 
indeed, but beautiful, to which everything else 
is related, and it has a scenic arrangement 
which is in some measure theatrical. The early 
scene where Elizabeth, bidden to Mary's fes- 
tivity, appears before her robed in black and 
uttering Cassandra cries of woe, shows the 
touch of the born dramatist. The scene with 
Wyatt and his followers is powerfully drama- 
tic, as are the scenes in the Tower, though these 
last are too scattered. Elizabeth's flight or pas- 
sage to Woodstock with Beddingfield and his 
knights, while Robin of the wildwood with his 
yeoman march unseen around her to ward 
off hostile strokes, is vividly portrayed. The 
shadowy creation of Robin, who is simply En- 
gland's love incarnate, is Mr. Shaler's triumph 
as an allegorizing poet. 

The second play, " The Rival Queens," has 
also a motive highly poetic if not theatrically 
effective. The gloomy, silent tower in the North 
where Mary of Scotland is imprisoned stands 
out threateningly against Elizabeth's busy, 
bustling court. But the contrast is hardly 
carried out dramatically, there is no collision 
of the Queens as in Schiller's great piece for 
the theatre, and the play falls apart at the 
close. There is one figure in this play, Petrie, 
the odd, loyal traitor, who is the most human 
and the best dramatically realized character in 
the whole work. He is new in kind and he does 
something. 



In " Armada Days" all pretense indeed of a 
drama is cast aside. It is a great sweeping ode 
of England's might. As far as we know, the 
passion, the exaltation, the greatness of those 
days has nowhere else found such utterance. 
England owes Mr. Shaler a debt for summing 
up the splendor of that, its greatest day, as no 
historian or poet has done before. 

In " The Death of Essex," Mr. Shaler has a 
really dramatic theme, but his curious fault of 
painting mainly by reflex action, of keeping his 
principals apart and letting intermediaries do 
the work they should be at themselves, destroys 
it as a play. It is a noble poem, however, and 
the conflicting emotions of Elizabeth as woman 
and Queen are depicted with consummate 
skill. 

The last play, " The Passing of the Queen," 
is little more than a series of pictures of En- 
gland in its glory and of Elizabeth in her dis- 
contented old age. Like Shakespeare in the 
final scenes of " The Merchant of Venice " 
and " The Tempest," Mr. Shaler has tried to 
present us with a vision of peace and beauty 
to calm our spirits after the storm and stress 
of the previous action. We wish we could say 
that he succeeds ; but his pastoral scenes are 
far less effective than his heroic ones. Never 
for a moment, with all his elaborated pictures 
of manor house and cottage, of wood and 
meadow and hill, does he recall the charm that 
resides in the moon-glimpsed gardens of Bel- 
mont or Prospero's airy pageant in the en- 
chanted isle. 

There must be fifteen thousand lines of 
blank verse in Mr. Shaler's work, certainly a 
gigantic experiment. It is more than that, — 
it is an achievement. The blank verse is really 
individual. It does not recall any modern mas- 
ter at all. Mr. Shaler, in his preface, says he 
has been told that it is in the manner of the 
Elizabethans, but he does not know why. It is 
easy to tell him. It is so crowded with meta- 
phors, so compact of similes, that it can recall 
nothing else but the rank growths of Eliza- 
bethan dramatic verse. Open at random and 
the style stares us in the face.

And make our fields to wonder how they lack

That is concentrated. In many of the quieter 
scenes the actors seem to be handing each 
other borquets of posies of speech, tied up with 
pink ribbons. Yet Mr. Shaler's verse is hardly 
the verse of the great artificers. It lacks their

sonority, their variety of cadence, most of all 
it lacks their sensuousness. It is not sensuous 
at all. We cannot indeed think of a single page 
in the five volumes which has the carven form, 
the blazing or sober color, habitual with the 
great users of English blank verse. Mr. 
Shaler's instrument is at its best in passages 
of emotion, good in a lower way in passages of 
thought, and not good at all in passages of 
desciiption. As he lacks, in the main, the 
faculty of scenic composition, so he lacks the 
gift of felicitous sensuous phrase. He strikes 
out fine lines again and again. "How hard to 
rule," says Elizabeth, 

'■ Men who are born with scepters in their hearts." 
But that is intellectualized. In his last play 
Mr. Shaler brings Shakespeare into the busi- 
ness, and for scene after scene he walks be- 
side Elizabeth and discourses with her on the 
large subjects of life and death. We cannot 
say that Shakespeare's moralities and philos- 
ophy, which the Queen accepts as oracles, 
strike us as being very profound ; and there are 
few passages which would seem fitting utter- 
ances of Shakespeare's golden mouth. Here 
is perhaps the speech that comes nearest to it. 
Elizabeth has practically asked Shakespeare to 
record her life, and he answers : 
" My Queen, were you our hearer, that we 'd do, 
And count all time and men our audience 
For perfect understanding of the part. 
But they who wait us cannot see the play 
That lives in splendor by them, for they feel 
The soul that is beside them like their own, — 
Fouled with the fellow earth they know too well; 
So we must seek the shadow land to find 
Brave empured names of other time and realm 
To bear the garb we fashion from the web 
Our common lives here weave. Ay, the far orbs 
Are as the earth, mere clods j yet they are stars 
For they are far : but had we dwelt on them, 
Trod in their mire and bitten of their dust 
We should not see their glory." 

Mr. Shaler has indeed made good the argu- 
ment of his preface. The scientist who can 
do such work as " Elizabeth of England " 
may confidently claim his place among the 
first poetic artists of his clime and time.

Man as the Centre of the Universe.* 



Under the general title of " The Belles Lettres Se- 
ries," Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. announce an extensive 
series of reprints, covering nearly the whole field of 
English literature. The characteristic note of the series 
is «' literature for literature's sake." The list of editors 
announced includes some of the most eminent scholars 
and litterateurs in this country and abroad. Several 
volumes will be published immediately. The books will 
be attractively bound, and sold at a very low price. 



Nearly a year ago there appeared in the 
" Fortnightly Review " an article on " Man's 
Place in the Universe," from the pen of Dr. 
Alfred Russel Wallace, whose name is a house- 
hold word among men of science the world over. 
The views set forth in this essay were so diver- 
gent from those usually advocated by writers 
on the plurality of worlds, that much discussion 
was aroused. Some astronomers, in particular, 
attacked the soundness of Dr. Wallace's ideas 
with considerable vigor. But he was in nowise 
disheartened, and determined to explain his 
theories in greater detail. 

Thus was born a substantial book bearing 
the title of the original article, and following 
the same general course of thought. Most 
writers on the plurality of habitable worlds 
have given free rein to the imagination, and 
have peopled the star depths with intelligent 
beings, many of whom may be vastly superior 
to mankind in mental power. They are not 
even content to leave the other bodies in our 
solar system tenantless. The remaining plan- 
ets, especially Mars, have been made to support 
sentient life, and the sun itself has been sup- 
posed to shelter inhabitants who were more or 
less content beneath its shining surface, being 
protected from the intense heat by a heavy 
layer of black cloud. With imaginings of this 
sort Dr. Wallace has no sympathy. His field 
of inquiry is restricted to a consideration of 
the evidence for or against the probable exist- 
ence on other worlds of such organic life, 
especially human, as is found upon the earth. 
Such an inquiry at once leads into the field of 
astronomy. So rapid has been the march of 
this science during the past few years, especially 
with reference to our knowledge of the sidereal 
universe, that Dr. Wallace considers it best to 
explain at length the processes employed by 
astronomers in this particular branch of re- 
search, and the substantial results won by their 
diligence. Therefore, after devoting a couple 
of chapters to a description of the main trend 
of thought pursued by former writers on the 
plurality of worlds, he discusses such topics 
as the distance and distribution of the stars, 
and their evolution, in the light of the " New 
Astronomy." To this discussion one-third of 
the book is devoted. The author's information

is drawn from a wide range of the best astro- 
nomical authorities, and is substantially accu- 
rate and up-to-date. He frequently refers to 
the writings of Professor Simon Newcomb, who 
is regarded by many as the foremost living 
astronomer, and to those of Miss Agnes Gierke, 
whose explanations of the results won by mod- 
ern astronomy are regarded by astronomers as 
complete, trustworthy, and altogether admir- 
able. 

Here and there Dr. Wallace makes remarks 
which show his lack of acquaintance with prac- 
tical astronomy, but these little slips do not 
affect the general trend of his writing. For 
example, on p. 38 he gives numerical values of 
the mean errors of spectroscopic observations 
of the velocities of stars in the line of sight, not 
realizing that the accuracy of such work has 
vastly increased since the observations which 
he mentions were made. On p. 79 it is stated 
that the time taken by light to pass from 
the sun to the earth is eight minutes thirteen 
and one-third seconds. It is several seconds 
greater than this. On p. 106 we read that 
" violent commotions in the sun, indicated by 
the sudden appearance of faculse, sun-spots, 
or prominences on the sun's limb, are always 
accompanied by magnetic disturbances on the 
earth "; this is not in accord with astronomical 
records. On p. 113 the ignition of meteors is 
attributed to " friction," instead of to the dim- 
inution of their energy by the pressure of the 
condensed air in front of them. On p. 128 
one finds the astonishing statement that " of 
course all the variable stars are to be found 
among the spectroscopic binaries," an item 
of information which will be news to those 
astronomers who are busied with researches on 
variables. 

But, as we have remarked, slips of this 
sort do not affect the author's main argument, 
which begins in the seventh chapter of his 
book. The conclusion toward which he works, 
and which he endeavors to render probable by 
a series of arguments which are drawn from 
the universe about us, and also from the phy- 
sical, chemical, and biological conditions which 
now obtain on the earth, is "that man, the cul- 
mination of conscious organic life, has been 
developed here only in the whole vast material 
universe we see around us." 

The foundation of the argument is as fol- 
lows. The stellar universe is not infinite in 
extent, but limited. The Milky Way, which 
contains the vast majority of the stars, is a 
huge ring surrounding us. Its component 



stars are made up of the chemical elements 
which we find on the earth and in our sun^ 
and these elements, together with the bodies 
which they form, are subject to the physical 
laws with which we are familiar. Near the 
centre of the Milky Way the sun, with its 
planetary family, is situated. This foundation^ 
or series of premises, is derived by Dr. Wallace 
from the writings of prominent astronomers, 
and may be said to represent, in general, the 
opinions prevailing among those who have 
looked into the subject particularly. Upon this 
substructure the author, availing himself con- 
tinually of the best current ideas in astronomy, 
geology, physiology, etc., erects his superstruc- 
ture. The train of reasoning is cumulative, 
and the method of presentation rouses the 
reader's interest, and puts him in sympathy 
with the author's contentions. The mysteries 
of organic life, its close adjustment to its ma- 
terial terrestrial environment, the changes in 
air, water, extent and elevation of land surface, 
atmospheric dust, etc., which would seriously 
modify or destroy man's existence, are set forth 
in fascinating fashion. The other planets of 
our system are examined and pronounced un- 
fit for habitation ; the existence of planetary 
systems about other stars is discussed, and its 
improbability asserted. 

The prevalent ideas of the evolution of man's 
body require that climatic conditions on the 
earth's surface shall have been substantially 
stable for ages past. Dr. Wallace claims that 
the sun has probably been near the centre of our 
universe for ages, and that this central position 
for a long period of time has been " specially 
favourable, perhaps absolutely essential, to life- 
development on the earth." But how shall we 
keep the sun near the centre of the universe, 
during millions of years, in the face of the fact 
that astronomers are well-nigh unanimous in 
asserting that it is moving approximately to- 
ward the star Vega ? To this the author replies 
that it is wholly improbable that the sun moves 
in a straight line, when all celestial movements 
known to us are in curves, and that it is "far 
more probable that we are moving in an orbit 
of some kind around the centre of gravity of 
a vast cluster, as determined by the investiga- 
tions of Kapteyn, Newcomb, and other astron- 
omers ; and, consequently, that the nearly 
central position we now occupy may be a per- 
manent one." On this point it must be said 
that astronomers generally think that the evi- 
dence now at command does not indicate that 
there is a centre about which the sun revolves.

However, this evidence does not exclude such 
an hypothesis, and Andi^ in his recent and 
highly praised work on stellar astronomy shows 
that such a theory of revolution conforms to 
certain facts about the observed proper motions 
of stars, and even deduces — by making cer- 
tain assumptions — a period of twenty-two mil- 
lion years for a single revolution. 

But, after all, what shall we say of a specu- 
lation which suggests the startling thought that 
man is perchance the designed outcome and 
crown of the workings of a universe which is 
so extensive and magnificent that the human 
mind is smitten with awe in contemplating its 
vastness, complexity, and splendor ? Is it pos- 
sible that the Creator has employed means so 
stupendous for the development of a creature 
seemingly so insignificant as man? Let us 
remember that the apparent immensity of the 
circuit of the Milky Way is due to the short- 
ness of the measuring rod which we apply to 
it, and that the shortness of the measuring rod 
is due to the fact that our physical forms are 
small and move slowly about the earth's sur- 
face, chained thereto by gravity. If we were 
to believe that the soul of man, when once it 
has laid aside " this muddy vesture of decay," 
can fly to Arcturus as quickly as it can now 
think itself there, how celestial distances which 
now appall us by their magnitude would shrink 
to hand-breadths ! If we were to take the dis- 
tance from the sun to some star in the Milky 
Way as a unit of measure, how moderate would 
its vast circumference appear ! Perhaps we 
should be willing to say with Milton 

" that great 
Or bright infers not excellence; the earth, 
Though in comparison of Heaven so small, 
Nor glistering, may of solid good contain 
More plenty than the sun that barren shines, 
Whose virtue in itself works no effect. 
But in the fruitful earth ; there first received 
His beams, unactive else, their vigor find." 

Let our conceptions of the potency, the pos- 
sible future magnificence, and the splendid 
powers of the human spirit become sufficiently 
exalted. Perchance we may reach some sum- 
mit of thought where we shall be ready to 
declare that the Almighty is not limited by 
our feeble and inadequate conceptions ; that 
He — with whom a thousand years are as " a 
watch in the night " — knows no bounds of 
time or space ; that He is not parsimonious 
amid infinite resources ; that He may have 
brought into being our wonderful universe, 
and have watched over and directed its devel- 
opment in order that it might become a school 



in which men, now in the feeble beginnings of 
a deathless life, might be trained for ends at 
present dimly perceived by them, but embraced 
in the all-sufficient phrase, " for the glory of 
Crod." Herbert A. Howe. 



Sculpture in America.* 



Sculpture is an austere muse — austere save 
when some rare genius discovers that artifice 
by which marble, or stone, is made suggestive 
of the morbidezza of painting. Art has been 
described as " the harmonic expression of 
human emotion"; of the plastic art one might 
have a prima facie right to say that it is 
the expression, through the emotions, of the 
character of the artist, it is the outcome of his 
idiosyncrasy, the expression of his manner of 
feeling in the presence of the visible world. 
Sculpture has its graces, but they are those of 
no other art ; it seldom gives rise to any rev- 
erie ; it awakens less than any other art the 
sentiment of the infinite, because it is never 
vague, obscure, indeterminate in its effects — 
everything is fixed with the last degree of pre- 
cision. As a nation, we are a practical and a 
cynical people, and the sculptors that appeal 
to us — appeal to the mind, to the soul, and 
bear thither a thought, a sentiment, capable of 
touching or elevating it — are few. 

In the comprehensive introduction to his 
" History of American Sculpture," Mr. Lorado 
Taft, himself a sculptor of no mean achieve- 
ment, points out that if British painting was 
unimportant in England at the time when the 
American colonies were in process of making, 
it may be said that British sculpture did not 
exist at all, in consequence of which our ances- 
tors here in America were without sculptural 
tradition. 

"The Pilgrim Fathers were the elder brothers of 
those men who decapitated the cathedral statuary, who 
burned paintings and tabooed the drama. This world 
to them was a vale of tears, and art was a temptation 
to be strenuously resisted. . . . The Quakers who fol- 
lowed in Pennsylvania were hardly more favorable to 
the fine arts than their brothers in New England. . . . 
The early Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam came 
direct from the land where Rembrandt and Franz Hals 
were even then producing their masterpieces; but there 
was neither a Rembrandt or a Hals among them, nor by 
any possibility a sculptor, since the artistic expression 
of the Hollanders has always been pictorial rather than 
plastic. ... It may be urged that the Virginia colonies

were made up of different material; that the cavaliers 
who founded Jamestown were to some extent men of 
culture and luxury. To this fact may be attributed the 
earliest patronage of sculpture in America — the com- 
missions given by Virginia to Houdon in 1781 and 1785 
for representations of Lafayette and Washington; but 
beyond this we find no appreciable results, since native 
production in the South came even later than in the 
North. ... So this broad land lay in the sun and 
waited — waited without knowing it for the day of art 
to appear." 

Though any attempt at classification is admit- 
ted to be more or less arbitrary, the space of 
time covered in Mr. Taft's book is divided in 
a general way into three periods : the first, 
1750 to 1850, bringing to notice " the faint 
foreshadowings of our coming achievements " 
— evidencing out of what unpromising material 
present conditions have been wrought and tell- 
ing, at the same time, with practical succinct- 
ness, a story of struggles and successes of the 
<leepe8t significance to American art ; the second 
period, 1850 to 1876, was characterized by a 
few sturdy men who made the succeeding period 
possible ; the third period, 1876 to 1903, sig- 
nalizes, in reality, the birth of sculpture in 
America — a period in which the art for the 
first time reached the dignity of a national 
expression — "something neither Anglo-Saxon 
nor Italian nor French ; but a fusing of all 
these elements into an art which is vital and 
significant — the true product of the country 
and the age which have given it birth." 

The opening chapters are concerned with the 
early history of the glyptic art in the United 
States, the first worker of whom there is record 
being Mrs. Patience Wright, who attained a 
wide reputation for clever portraits in wax long 
before the Revolution. Then followed the wood- 
carving of William Rush and the unrelated 
efforts of Hezekiah Augur. With the opening 
years of the last century came the first Amer- 
cans destined to make sculpture a profession, — 
Greenough in Boston, Crawford in New York, 
Powers in Cincinnati. " It is difficult to real- 
ize," says Mr. Taft, " that our actual achieve- 
ment from the very kindergarten stage of an 
unknown art to the proud position held by 
American sculpture in the Paris Exposition of 
1900 has been the work of three score years 
and ten — has been in its entirety by not a few 
men now living." 

No previous work has ever covered the ground 
referred to as the first period so concisely as the 
present volume. The chapters on minor sculp- 
tors of the early days include many names 
hitherto omitted. A chapter devoted, to the 
native element in early American sculpture 



deserves careful perusal ; in it special stress is 
laid upon the work of Clark Mills, who first 
taught our forefathers the meaning of the words 
" equestrian statue." 

As their own country afforded neither sculp- 
tural instruction nor examples, almost all Amer- 
ican sculptors of the first half of the century 
were animated by a single desire — to get to 
Italy. American colonies existed at Rome and 
Florence, where the student adopted theCanova 
tradition of sweetened classicism and worked 
in an atmosphere tainted with artistic and 
political decadence. In his "American Masters 
of Sculpture," Mr. Charles H. Caffin contends 
that it is not surprising that much of the sculp- 
ture of this period, though considerably admired 
in its day, strikes us now as coldly and pedantic- 
ally null, unconvincing, and grandiloquent, or, 
at best, innocuously sentimental. It was Emer- 
son who said in the presence of these uninspired 
works, " the art of sculpture has long ago per- 
ished to any real effect." The succeeding phase 
of Italo- American art — " this universal pretti- 
ness, which seems to be the highest conception 
of the crowd of modern sculptor8,"as Hawthorne 
lamented, — gained for this cotorie the name 
of executants, not composers. Then followed 
a reaction against self-expatriation. Henry 
Kirke Brown, of whose work the equestrian 
statue of General Scott at Washington is a 
conspicuous example, studied in Italy, but with 
the conviction that American sculptors should 
occupy themselves with American subjects upon 
American soil. Goethe used to say that no man 
can discern the heart of a movement or of a 
work of art, who does not put himself into 
heart relations with that which he is trying to 
understand. Very few of that self-expatriated 
school of American sculptors escaped the level- 
ing influence of Italy. The man who reads 
the Iliad and the Odyssey with his heart as 
well as his intelligence must measurably enter 
into the life which these poems describe and 
interpret ; he must identify himself for the 
time with the race whose soul and historic 
character are revealed in epic form as in a 
great mirror ; he must see life from the Greek 
point of view, and feel life as the Greek felt 
it. It is little wonder that the few Americans 
who accepted commissions for American sub- 
jects and chiselled these works in their foreign 
studios failed to achieve success. 

It was at the Centennial Exhibition that this 
country first beheld the wonders of foreign art. 
Parisian-trained sculptors rose into a prom- 
inence which, within a short time, became 



162

[March 1, 



domination. With only a few exceptions all 
our sculptors of the present generation have 
acquired their training, either wholly or in 
part, in Paris. But our art is not now French 
as it was once Italian. With the advent of 
Saint-Gaudens there came a notable change 
in the spirit of American sculpture, — Paris 
merely vitalized the dormant tastes and ener- 
gies of America. Mr. Caffin has this to say : 

" France, ever since the middle ages, has never been 
without a succession of great sculptors. When the Gothic 
spirit had spent itself, that of the late Italian Renaissance 
was imported ; and the art, continually adjusting itself to 
the changing conditions of national life, has been held in 
uninterrupted honour to the present time. It is in this 
branch of the fine arts that the French genius has found 
its most individual expression. Corresponding with the 
maintenance of fine traditions is the excellence of the 
system of teaching. The Institute and the Ecole des 
Beaux Arts perpetuate a standard, characterized by 
technical perfection and elegance of style, while the 
tendency to academic narrowness is offset by the influ- 
ence of independent sculptors; for there is not a thought 
wave in modern art that does not emanate from or 
finally reach Paris. It is the world's clearing-house of 
artistic currency." 

Mr. Taft's reasoning, along these same lines, 
on the subject of Franco-American training is 
interesting. He says : 

" While the men of the new generation have acquired 
such mastery of the ' mechanics ' of thi profession as 
wins the praise of their foreign instructors, their lan- 
guage is not always understood at home. Our people 
have no intuitive grasp of its meaning. In spite of the 
oft-repeated assurance that we know what we like, we 
do not even know what we are saying when we say it. 
It is true that we recognize what we like, and that we 
like it well, for the time at least. On the other hand, 
we do not have a 'grand passion ' for sculpture, taking 
it to heart like the modern French. Our feelings are 
not outraged by bad work, nor by transgressions of 
venerated laws of style, of balance, of movement, and 
of other sacred traditions. Likewise are we insensible, 
in large measure, to the charm of these fundamental 
virtues. Unless a work of sculpture shows something 
more, unless it makes a special appeal by its significance, 
its emotion, or its insistent beauty of face or form, we 
are as indifferent to it as though it were not; we do 
not, perhaps, even see it. We lose much, of course, 
but there is after all something rather fine in this sturdy 
independence. It may, indeed it must, result in an art 
of greater meaning and intensity than we have hereto- 
fore known. We say to the artist, as it were: * Put in 
all the " composition," all the " technic " you please; we 
have nothing against them ; but first of all give us some- 
thing we can understand and sympathize with.' Hence 
it follows that the mere ' Beaux- Arts figure,* so closely 
allied with the ohjet de Paris, has already had its day 
with a considerable portion of our community. It has 
followed the Graces and the Cupids of our Italian age." 

Mr. Caffin's volume and the closing portion 
of Mr. Taft's work are both descriptive of 
the last quarter of a century's history of our 
sculpture. Space will not permit us to draw 



comparisons of the critical treatment of con- 
temporary artists by the two authors. Both 
concede that the position of Augustus Saint- 
Gaudens is one of preeminence — that no other 
sculptor of our time has so attuned the tradi- 
tions of his art to the key of the modern spirit 
for the expression of grand con ceptions. A mongr 
other sculptors treated in special chapters by 
both writers are Macmonnies, Ward, Bartlett, 
French, Adams, Brenner, Niehaus, and Bar- 
nard. In conclusion Mr. Taft argues that in 
this bewildering period of American history, 
elements new, varied, and contradictory are 
pouring into the national crucible ; doubtless 
the solvent will be adequate to reduce all these 
to a condition of homogeneity, but no man can 
say just what the ultimate product will be. 

Mr. Caffin has written with notable clear- 
ness of the great American figures in this art. 
The distinguishing feature of his book is that 
it is a critical review, constantly illuminating 
facts by principles. The earnest and animated 
style in which it is written grows out of the 
subject and is supported by it, always rising 
naturally to the requirements of the occasion. 

That Mr. Taft clears away a great deal of 
dead wood from the obscure records of early 
American sculpture is a thing to be thankful 
for. Of the value of his book as a history for 
general reference, it would be hard to say too 
much. It is true that probably no one person 
will agree with all his statements, but, on the 
other hand, there are few who will not approve 
of the general tendency of his remarks. That 
he should now and then arouse contradiction 
is not surprising, for there are many points in 
the subject he has chosen in regard to which 
authority and reason may justly differ. 

Both volumes are attractively printed and 
bound, and both contain numerous illustrations-

Many years ago Macaulay commended to our

write a great book ; proving it by the extreme 
case of James Boswell and his Life of Johnson, 
But the fallacy of the dictum lies in the un- 
equal " distribution " of the term " great. "^ 
Boswell's hero was great, and the portrait of 
him was literally a " speaking likeness," but

the eager, servile, foolish, painstaking Bozzy 
could not produce a book that was, in any hon- 
orably subjective sense, great. It is the great 
Doctor who wrote that book on the soft recep- 
tive tablets of his follower's memory ; and the 
true fame of it is his. Yet, somehow, we would 
not have it otherwise. Had Boswell been wiser 
or more self-respecting, English literature would 
have lacked perhaps its most entertaining biog- 
raphy. 

The " Creevey Papers " are of the genre of 
Samuel Pepys's Diary rather than that of 
James Boswell's Life of Johnson. Mr. Thomas 
Creevey lived for the larger part of a life of 
seventy years among the royalty, nobility, and 
gentry of England ; instead of one adored great 
man he had no hero (unless possibly it were 
Lord Grey), and yet he knew everybody. Born 
at Liverpool in 1768, he was educated for the 
bar, but entered Parliament in 1802 as repre- 
sentative of the borough of Thetford, which, 
in those good old unreformed days, was in the 
pocket of the Duke of Norfolk. His shrewd- 
ness, activity, and tact made him a useful party 
man to the Whigs, especially the Radical wing 
of that party ; while his good-humor, his fund 
of anecdote, and his willingness to fit in any- 
where, made him a frequent guest at number- 
less dinner-tables in town and country. When 
the Whigs came into power in 1806, Creevey 's 
services were recognized by his appointment to 
the Secretaryship of the Board of Control, a 
minor position in the " Cabinet Of All the 
Talents," which he held for only a year, going 
out with the short-lived ministry in 1807. 
Later, he sat in Parliament for the pocket- 
boroughs of Appleby and Downton, succes- 
sively. In 1880, at the age of sixty-two, he 
received from the Whig government, first the 
Treasurership of the Ordnance, and afterwards 
that of Greenwich Hospital. He died in 1838. 

Such is the meagre outline of an active but 
in no way illustrious career. Its interest to us 
consists in the fact that this industrious man 
found time, during his forty years of public 
life, to write voluminous letters to his step- 
daughter. Miss Elizabeth Ord, as well as to 
numerous friends ; and in this immense mass 
of papers we have a sort of journal intirne of 
English court, political, and society life, from 
the latter days of George the Third to the 
accession of Queen Victoria. By actual count, 
the index to these volumes contains flhe names 
of about 1450 persons, mostly of high degree, 
with whom Creevey had some sort of acquaint- 
ance. A more resolute diner-out never lived. 



and he was admitted on intimate terms to some 
of the noblest houses in England, from Windsor 
Castle down. It is not surprising to hear that 
the publication of these papers has stirred up 
much interest in British circles. 

As a young man, Creevey belonged to the 
Prince of Wales's set, with social headquarters 
at the Pavilion in Brighton ; and a careful search 
through these letters fails to disclose a single 
creditable item to improve the accepted reputa- 
tion of the First Gentleman of Europe. None 
of George the Fourth's entourage at any time 
of his life had any illusions about him, and 
Creevey least of all. The atmosphere of those 
unedifying days reeks with the fumes of strong 
drink. Let one scene suffice. 

" It used to be the Duke of Norfolk's custom to come 
over every year from Arundel to pay his respects to the 
Prince and to stay two days at Brighton, both of which 
he always dined at the Pavilion. In the year 1804, 
upon this annual visit, the Prince had drunk so much as 
to be made very seriously ill by it, so that in 1805 (the 
year that I was there), when the Duke came, Mrs. 
Fitzherbert, who was always the Prince's best friend, 
was very much afraid of his being again made ill, and 
she persuaded the Prince to adopt different stratagems 
to avoid drinking with the Duke. I dined there on both 
days, and letters were brought in each day after din- 
ner to the Prince, which he affected to consider of great 
importance, and so went out to answer them, while the 
Duke of Clarence went on drinking with the Duke of 
Norfolk. But on the second day this joke was carried 
too far, and in the evening the Duke of Norfolk showed 
he was affronted. The Prince took me aside and said 
— * Stay after every one is gone to-night. The Jockey's 
got sulky, and I must give him a broiled bone to get 
him in good humor again.' So of course I stayed, and 
about one o'clock the Prince of Wales and the Duke of 
Clarence, the Duke of Norfolk and myself sat down to 
a supper of broiled bones, the result of which was that, 
having fallen asleep myself, I was awoke by the sound 
of the Duke of Norfolk's snoring. I found the Prince 
of Wales and the Duke of Clarence in a very animated 
discussion as to the particular shape and make of the 
wig worn by George II." 

Creevey's intimacy with the Prince ended 
when the latter became Regent ; and from this 
time on, the letters have plenty of robust crit- 
icism of the Defender of the Faith, who is gen- 
erally referred to as "Prinney." When the 
famous suit for divorce against Queen Caroline 
was underway in the autumn of 1820, Creevey 
was an eager listener to all the proceedings. 
He sent off to his step-daughter hourly notes 
of the trial's progress, and joined lustily in 
the general rejoicings when the Government's 
attack upon the Queen had broken down. 

" Three times three I if you please, before you read a 
word further. The Bill is gone, thank God ! to the 
devil. Their majority was brought down to nine — 108 
to 99; and then the dolorous Liverpool came forward

and struck. He moved that his own bill be read this day 
six months. You may well suppose the state we are all 
in. The Queen was in the house at the time, but 
Brougham sent her off instantly. . . . The state of the 
town is beyond everything. I wish to God you could 
see Western. He is close by my side, but has not 
uttered yet — such is his surprise." 

In the autumn of 1814, Mrs. Creevey's 
health beginning to fail, her husband took her 
to Brussels. Considering the date, it turned 
out a singularly inappropriate place for an in- 
valid needing rest and tranquility ; for the 
Creeveys were still there when the return of 
Napoleon from Elba brought on the Hundred 
Days and Waterloo. As Mr. Creevey kept 
quite a full diary during those eventful times, 
and as he was honored with a good deal of the 
Duke of Wellington's confidence, we get some 
new and vivid glimpses of the great soldier. 
When the Duke returned to Brussels after the 
battle of Waterloo, Creevey visited him at his 
lodgings. 

" As I approached, I saw people collected in the street 
about the house; and when I got amongst them, the first 
thing I saw was the Duke upstairs alone at his window. 
Upon his recognizing me, he immediately beckoned to 
me with his finger to come up. . . . The first thing I 
did, of course, was to put out my hand and congratu- 
late him upon his victory. He made a variety of obser- 
vations in his short, natural, blunt way, but with the 
greatest gravity all the time, and-without the least ap- 
proach to anything like triumph or joy. « It has been 
a damned serious business,' he said. ' Blficber and I 
have lost 30,000 men. It has been a damned nice 
thing — the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life. 
Bliicher lost 14,000 on Friday night, and got so dam- 
nably licked I could not find him on Saturday morning; 
so I was obliged to fall back to keep up (regain ?) my 
communications with him.' Then, as he walked about, 
he greatly praised those Guards who kept the farm 
(meaning Hougomont) against the repeated attacks of 
the French ; and then he praised all our troops, uttering 
repeated expressions of astonishment at our men's cour- 
age. He repeated so often its being so nice a thing — 
so nearly run a thing, that I asked him if the French 
had fought better than he had ever seen them do before. 

— 'No,' he said, « they have always fought the same 
since I first saw them at Vimeira.' . . . Now that seven 
years have elapsed since that battle, and tho' the Duke 
has become — very foolishly, in my opinion — a poli- 
tician, and has done many wrong and foolish things 
since that time, yet I think of his conversation and 
whole conduct on the 19th — the day after the battle 

— exactly the same as I did then; namely, that nothing 
could do a conqueror more honor than his gravity and 
seriousness at the loss of life he had sustained, his ad- 
mission of his great danger, and the justice he did the 
enemy." 

For so good a Kadical, Creevey could be a 
stout opponent of progress when it took the 
form of railways, the introduction of which 
was bitterly fought by his friends the landed 
proprietors. He submitted, however, like 



everybody else, to the inevitable ; and his de- 
scription of his "first ride on the cars" (which 
in his case was " a ride on the first cars,") has 
a curious interest to-day. 

" 14th (November, 1829). To-day we have had a lark 
of a very high order. Lady Wilton sent over yester- 
day from Knowsley to say that the Loco Motive ma- 
chine was to be at such a place upon the railway at 
12 o'clock for the Knowsley party to ride in if they 
liked, and inviting this house to be of the party. So 
of course we were at our post in 3 carriages and some 
horsemen at the hour appointed. I had the satisfac- 
tion, for I can't call it pleasure, of taking a trip of five 
miles in it, which we did in just a quarter of an hour. 
As accuracy upon this subject was my great object, I 
held my watch in my hand at starting, and all the time; 
and as it has a second hand, I knew I could not be de- 
ceived; and it so turned out there was not the differ- 
ence of a second between the coachee or conductor and 
myself. But observe, during those five miles, the ma- 
chine was occasionally made to put itself out, or go itj 
and then we went at the rate of 23 miles an hour, and 
just with the same ease as to motion or absence of 
friction as the other reduced pace. But the quickest 
motion is to me frightful; it is really flying, and it is 
impossible to divest yourself of the notion of instant 
death to all upon the least accident happening. It gave 
me a headache which has not left me yet. Sefton is 
convinced that some damnable thing must come of it; 
but he and I seem more struck with such apprehension 
than others. . . . The smoke is very inconsiderable 
indeed, but sparks of fire are abroad in some quan- 
tity; one burnt Miss de Ros's cheek, another a hole in 
Lady Maria's silk pelisse, and a third a hole in some 
one else's gown. Altogether, I am extremely glad in- 
deed to have seen this miracle, and to have travelled in 
it. Had I thought worse of it than I do, I should have 
had the curiosity to try it; but, having done so, I am 
quite satisfied with my frst achievement being my last" 

The free and easy atmosphere pervading 
these letters precludes any literary finish ; the 
tone is colloquial and at times low ; slang is 
not eschewed ; and every eminent person of the 
day is regularly nicknamed. George the Third 
is " Old Nobs"; George the Fourth " Prinney "; 
his consort is "Mrs. P."; and William the 
Fourth is "Our Billy." To call the Duke of 
Norfolk "The Jockey" is only historical; less 
obvious are such names as "Slice" for the 
Duke of Gloucester, " The Pop" for the Duchess 
of Cleveland, and " Madagascar " for Lady Hol- 
land ; while Creevey's distrust of the brilliant 
Lord Brougham shows itself in a variety of 
epithets — " Beelzebub," " The Archfiend," 
and " Wickedshifts." 

We have only passing glimpses of some of 
the wits and men of letters whom Creevey was 
continually meeting and dining with, such as 
Sheridan, Sydney Smith, Luttrell, " Tommy " 
Moore, and Samuel Rogers — whose deathly 
appearance is rather heavily satirized by speak- 
ing of him as "the deceased poet." Creevey

must have heard a great many mots with which 
he might have brightened his pages. He loy- 
ally records a gallant saying of the sailor King, 
William the Fourth, about Lady Wellesley 
(who was a daughter of Mr. Caton, of Phila- 
delphia). 

" When she was in waiting at Windsor, some one, in 
talking of Mrs. TroUope's book, said, < Do you come 
from that part of America where they " guess " and 
where they " calculate " ? * King Billy said, * Lady 
Wellesley comes from where ihej fascinate.' " 

Creevey lived long enough to see the acces- 
sion of Victoria, whose fresh young purity and 
decision of character brought a great sigh of 
relief and hope from a long-burdened nation. 
The veteran politician did ready homage to 
her charm, but coolly and perhaps maliciously 
thus touches up her personality : 

" Here comes in the Queen, the Duchess of Kent the 
least bit in the world behind her, all her ladies in a row 
still more behind; Lord Conyngham and Cavendish on 
each flank of the Queen. . . . She was told by Lord 
Conyngham that I bad not been presented, upon which 
a scene took place that to me was truly distressing. 
The poor little thing could not get her glove off. I 
never was so annoyed in my life; yet what could I do? 
but she blushed and laughed and pulled, till the thing 
was done, and I kissed her hand. . . . Then to dinner. 
. . . The Duchess of Kent was agreeable and chatty, 
and she said, 'Shall we drink some wine?' My eyes, 
however, were all the while fixed upon Vic. To miti- 
gate the harshness of any criticism I may pronounce 
upon her manners, let me express my conviction that 
she and her mother are one. I never saw a more pretty 
or natural devotion than she shows to her mother in 
everything, and I reckon this as by far the most ami- 
able, as well as valuable, disposition to start with in the 
fearful struggle she has in life before her. Now for her 
appearance — but all in the strictest confidence. A 
more homely little being you never beheld, when she is 
at her ease, and she is evidently dying to be always more 
so. She laughs in real earnest, opening her mouth as 
wide as it can go, showing not very pretty gums. . . . 
She eats as heartily as she laughs, I think I may say 
she gobbles. . . . She blushes and laughs every instant 
in so natural a way as to disarm everybody. Her voice 
is perfect, and so is the expression of her face when she 
means to say or do a pretty thing. ... At night I 
played two rubbers of whist, one against the Duchess of 
Kent, and one as her partner. . . . The Queen, in leav- 
ing the room at night, came across quite up to me, and 
said, • How long do you stay at Brighton, Mr. Creevey? ' 
Which I presume could mean nothing else than another 
rubber for her mother. So it's all mighty well." 

We have spoken of these volumes as a book 
by Mr. Creevey. So they are ; but we owe 
their appearance in this form to the industry 
and good taste of Sir Herbert Maxwell, who 
has edited them from the mass of papers placed 
at his disposal by Mrs. Blackett Ord, whose 
husband was the grandson of Mr. Creevey's 
eldest step-daughter. Sir Herbert has con- 
nected the extracts by explanatory paragraphs 



and has supplied plenty of personal footnotes 
telling us " who 's who." His task must have 
been, even at this late day, a delicate one. Bat 
it has probably been done with discrimination, 
and what few comments the editor has allowed 
himself have made us wish for more. The 
portraits, of which there are twenty-one, are 
beautifully reproduced in photogravure from 
pictures by Lawrence, Landseer, and others ; 
and the indispensable index is not wanting.

Recent Books of Travel..* 



The decadence of travel on American rivers, the 
rise of the Pullman car, and the decline of the pas- 
senger steamboat have left the present generation 
in gross ignorance of some of the finest of nature's 
panoramas, and have made unfamiliar to modern eyes 
the paths of early explorers and navigators, mission- 
aries and soldiers, traders and naturalists. Not the 
least important among these highways of pioneer 
days is the Ohio river, graphically described by Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites in his volume entitled '* On 
the Storied Ohio." Here we are given the narrative 
of a journey by skifiE in 1894 from Brownville on 
the Monongahela to the " Father of Waters " at 
Cairo. An earlier account of this journey was 
printed in 1897 under the title "Afloat on the 
Ohio." The present new edition has been revised, 
and provided with numerous and suitable illustra- 
tions. No one is better able than Mr. Thwaites to 
write of the scenes which the banks of this stream 
witnessed in the early days of our history, nor to 
describe the part which this pathway played in the 
struggles between the English and the French for 
the possession of the West and in the losing fight 
which the red man waged against the pioneer a cen- 
tury and more ago. The book is unique in its

subject, interesting as a tale of travel and adven- 
ture, and especially valuable on account of its very 
full historical setting. 

Though the Canadian Pacific Railvray has drawn 
public attention to their accessibility in recent years, 
and tourists make short excursions among them 
from Banff and Glacier, the Canadian Rockies are 
but little known. The disappearance of trails over 
the passes following the decline of the fur trade has 
80 hindered exploration that Mounts Brown and 
Hooker, guardians of the Athabascan pass, have 
stood unchallenged since they were named by the 
botanist David Douglass in 1827. They were re- 
duced from their high estate in 1900 by Messrs. 
CoUid and Stutfield, and Mounts Forbes, Colum- 
bia, and Alberta were raised to reign in their stead 
as monarchs of the Rockies. Although members of 
the Appalachian Club have done much of late to 
bring these Canadian peaks and glaciers to the atten- 
tion of lovers of mountain climbing, it is to the 
enterprise of two English sportsmen (not of the 
sanguinary sort) that we are indebted for the fullest 
account yet published of that region. Mr. Hugh 
E. M. Stutfield, noted for his travels in Morocco, 
and Mr. J. Norman Collie, the veteran climber of 
the Himalayas, have made extended exploring trips 
among the Canadian Rockies, climbed many of the 
hitherto unsealed peaks, discovered glaciers and 
snow fields exceeding in extent those of the Alps, 
and completed a number of surveys of uncharted 
territory. A well-illustrated account of their ex- 
ploits is presented in "Climbing and Exploration 
in the Canadian Rockies," a work which gives not 
only the personal experiences of the authors, but in 
an historical rSsumS tells what is known from past 
explorations of surveyors, trappers, and guides. The 
recent writings of other enthusiasts are also quoted, 
so that the volume is an epitome of all that is known 
at present concerning this Switzerland of America. 
A carefully prepared map gives the results of the 
writers' explorations and the elevations thus far de- 
termined, while a chapter on sport and game is in- 
tended for the hunter. Near the Kootenay Plains, an 
old Indian gathering-place, where the tributaries of 
the Saskatchewan draining the largest icefields of 
these mountains unite to form the main stream, is 
the place which seems to the authors an ideal one 
for a tourist centre. " We may fairly anticipate that 
at the mouth of Bear Creek will be the Chamonix 
or Grindelwald of the Canadian Alps in days to 
come, when the remoter peaks and valleys of this 
beautiful region are more accessible to the outside 
world, and the new mountain playground of the 
American continent becomes no longer a dream but 
a reality." 

Mountain climbing in Switzerland presents a 
very different aspect to the novice than in the 
region described in the book just dealt with. In 
Switzerland experienced guides know the various 
routes and are aware of the dangers which beset 
them. A maximum of accomplishment with a mini- 
mum of effort is, barring hostile weather, assured 



to the tourist. The charms and terrors of the 
Jungfrau and the Wetterhorn are revealed in Mr. 
Daniel P. Rhodes's " A Pleasure Book of Grindel- 
wald," a work in which holiday travellers to the 
Oberland will find much of interest " outside of the 
province of the regular guide-books." The read- 
able text and fine illustrations in Mr. Rhodes's 
volume afford an excellent portrayal of the charms 
of this famous valley and its environs, and an in- 
sight into the life of the villagers of the Bernese 
Alps. A novel account is given of Grindelwald in 
winter and the sports at the rink. Those who have 
been, or intend to go, to Switzerland, or who plan 
or practise mountain climbing elsewhere, will find 
Mr. Rhodes's book rewarding. 

The reader who enjoys a running tale of travel, 
full of incident and illumined by conversation and 
small talk on topics more or less pertinent to the 
place and scene, will find his account in Mr. Charles 
W. Wood's " Norwegian By-Ways." The author 
is a veteran traveller well known through his books 
in similar vein on Spain and France. The present 
volume is not a collection of classified or assorted 
information, or even a work dominated by any par- 
ticular aim or revealing any characteristic point of 
view. The passing incident, the chance acquain- 
tance, the skydsgut, the snowfield, — mayhap the 
marmalade, serve as links in the chain of smoothly- 
flowing conversations which make up the greater 
part of the book. Withal it gives a pleasing pic- 
ture of the rugged land and sturdy folk of Norway. 

The story of a quiet summer spent in a quaint 
German castle at Staufenberg in Hessia is told, in 
a manner which brings to the reader much of the 
charm of village life in rural Germany, by Profes- 
sor James Taf t Hatfield, in his book entitled '' From 
Broom to Heather." With its abundant illustra- 
tions the volume affords an excellent picture of 
tourist experiences among Hessian villages and vil- 
lage folk and in the mediaeval town of Rothenberg. 
There is an account of the water cure at Salzscblirf , 
and an interesting chapter on Berlin. Regarding 
the latter city, the author says that " a new spirit 
has come into its architecture, a spirit which ex- 
presses itself in a joyous display of power and super- 
abundant luxury, but which at the same time brings 
to its service a cultured and discriminating taste." 
He notes in Berlin, also, the new movement in 
decorative art, " a long delayed manifesto against 
the heaviness and dulness of traditional styles and 
conventions." 

From the point of view of the Quartier Latin, 
the artist Mr. F. Berkeley Smith writes most enter- 
tainingly of " Budapest, the City of the Magyars," 
— of Pest, the miracle of modernity, with its broad 
streets, fine buildings, up-to-date tramways and 
underground railway, superb opera-house, parks, 
museums, and magnificent Parliament buildings, 
and of Buda with its palace. That this splendid 
city is not better known by the average traveller is 
due, says the author, to the fact that tourists are 
systematically discouraged from stopping at Pest

by the Viennese, owing to the enmity existing be- 
tween the Austrians and the Hungarians. The au- 
thor is a clever raconteur, and he gives his readers 
a spicy account of his visit to a Magyar nobleman's 
estate, of the theatres, music halls, baths, and clubs 
of the city, and of the gipsy camps and their fa- 
mous music. The work is lavishly supplied with 
illustrations, notable for their excellence and fitness, 
from scenes painted, drawn, or photographed by 
the author. 

In sharp contrast with the cleanliness and en- 
terprise of this Magyar city on the verge of the 
Orient are the filth, antiquated facilities for travel 
and comfort, and the social and political instability 
of " Syria and Palestine of To-day," as described 
by Mr. W. E. Curtis, the veteran newspaper corre- 
spondent. The author makes very apparent the 
inadequacy of Turkish rule and the apathy of the 
people toward the Sultan, and he cites the evidence 
of the profound impression which the visit of the 
German Emperor made upon the country. The 
account of the changes wrought by the five German 
Lutheran colonies, which are made up largely from 
American sources, is of special interest. These col- 
onies are industrial communities which seek to 
regenerate the people of Palestine by offering an 
example of modern civilization and honest industry 
to Gentiles and Jews. Incidentally, their clean 
beds and fair charges are a godsend to travellers 
in a land where filth and extortion abound. Mr. 
Curtis's book, though made up of newspaper 
"copy," is comprehensive, modern, and apparently 
unbiased — except possibly as regards the Turk. 

In his volume entitled " Toward the Rising 
Sun," Mr. Sigmund Krausz takes his readers over 
a much greater extent of territory than do the two 
previous writers, his route lying from Constanti- 
nople, the ports of Greece and Asia Minor, through 
Egypt and India. Mr. Krausz follows the beaten 
path of tourists, recording his personal impressions 
of the sights along the way and freely expressing 
his opinions of the people with whom he comes in 
contact. His point of view appears to be that of 
a matter-of-fact commercial traveller, and his com- 
ments, while interesting and often entertaining, are 
devoid of any historical, sociological, or artistic 
perspective. The illustrations are abundant, but 
not always in good taste or of the best quality. 

A story of personal adventure among the Indians 
of the Mosquito Coast and with the Talamanca 
tribe in Costa Rica, and an account of extended 
travel in the coastal country of the United States of 
Columbia, across the mountains to Bogota, and on 
the Isthmus between Colon and Panama, is con- 
tained in Dr. Francis C Nicholas's "Around the 
Caribbean and across Panama." The author visited 
these countries in the interests of mining and com- 
mercial enterprises, and also in the service of the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
His commissions led him far from the few main 
lines of travel into the wilderness of tropical forest 
and waterways, where torrential rains, floods, fever, 



tropical vermin, savage beasts, and treacherous 
natives insure variety and interest, if not comfort 
and safety, to the traveller. Dr. Nicholas favors 
the Panama route for the Isthmian canal, and his 
book contains some interesting, though poorly- 
reproduced, photographs of the proposed route. 
The volume is interesting and timely, though not 
as illuminating on matters of present-day interest 
as many readers might wish. 

Mr. Leonard Williams, author of " The Land of 
the Dons," is an Englishman, whose long residence 
in Spain, together with a facile pen and ability at 
investigation, make him competent to wiite a book 
which covers with some degree of thoroughness not 
only the physical features of the country and the 
characteristics of the inhabitants, but also something 
of its literature, its political and social history, and 
the present national situation. One feels after read- 
ing the volume that much has been learnt about the 
country. Suggestive and interesting is the historical 
sketch to which the last quarter of the book is de- 
voted, under the novel captions, " The Past of the 
Present," "The Present of the Present," "The 
Future of the Present." Here are given a statement 
and summing-up of past mistakes in Spanish policy, 
foreign and internal, and an analysis of the defects 
in the nation's political and social life. The author 
outlines various reforms which a kindly feeling to- 
wards Spain and a belief in her future leads him to 
expect. The book is made delightful by the per- 
sonality of the writer. It is a charmingly humorous 
and upright mind that is here revealed, with a poetic 
temperament occasionally showing itself in some bit 
of perhaps too consciously fine writing. 

Mr. Williams is also the author of a new volume 
entitled "Toledo and Madrid, their Records and 
Romances." With light and vivid touch the writer 
takes us through scenes connected with Toledo's 
past and present. We visit Pedro the Armourer's 
work-shop, and see the famous blade in process of 
construction. We roam about the city, visiting the 
streets of the various crafts, and the ancient market 
with its cheaper stalls set apart for the poor. We 
visit the Jew's quarter, and watch a famous duel. 
It is all a dream that might easily come to one 
where every object so speaks of the past that the 
traveller and the present-day tenant seem anachron- 
isms. The intimate connection of Toledo with the 
ecclesiastical history of Spain, and the overshadow- 
ing of State by Church to the detriment of the 
country, is vividly set forth, and in the author's 
summary of Toledo of to-day is furnished an epitome 
of Spain's decline. The chapters on Madrid are 
devoted largely to historical matters, chiefly to an 
account of the manners and customs of the long 
reign of Philip IV., who came to the throne in 1621. 
The elaborate costumes of man and maid, the ex- 
travagant pastimes, and the vice and crime which 
everywhere flourished are described at length. The 
topography and economic and moral standing of 
" New Madrid " are dwelt on, but little is said con- 
cerning its art or architecture. The volume closes

we said of it when the first volumes appeared need

these sections as we were to have the earlier ones, 
and the work as a whole is highly satisfactory

the consequence of printing it upon unnecessarily

easily have sufficed for the whole, instead of four. 
Dr. Garnett, to our pleasant surprise, is the au-

carrying the record down to the death of Shake- 
speare, and leaving Dr. Gosse to begin his share of 
the task with the Jacobean writers. We say this 
because, on the whole, the work of the senior author 
has a better balance, a surer judgment, and a greater 
degree of accuracy than that of his colleague. In 
his treatment of Shakespeare Dr. Garnett, in our 
opinion, has too much dignified the Baconian lunacy 
by the amount of attention he pays to that most 
amazing of mare's nests. What he says is, of course, 
wholly by way of refutation, but we doubt if it was 
advisable to allude to it at all. And on still other 
grounds we may indulge in a little fault-finding 
when we come upon such an unpunctuated sentence 
as the following : " Bacon might be deemed capable 
of composing the speeches of Ulysses but these wood 
notes wild ! " But the treatment of Shakespeare and 
his group is on the whole admirable : popular in the 
best sense, yet the product of an exacting scholar- 
ship, and beyond all praise in the wealth of its illus- 
trative matter. The illustrations are, of course, the 
essential raison d'Ure of the whole work, and it is 
not easy to say enough in commendation of this 
feature of the record. So rich a collection of por- 
traits, places, autographs, and illuminations has 
never before been made — could hardly have been 
imagined — in connection with the subject of En- 
glish literature, before the appearance of these four 
volumes. Volume IV., if anything a trifle thicker 
and heavier than its predecessors, is entirely the 
work of Dr. Gosse. The illustrations, as the author 
admits, " descend through grades of picturesque 
decline to the period, not merely of the frock-coat 
and of the top-hat, but of that most insesthetic 
instrument, the photographer's lens." However, 
they remain quite as numerous as before, and be- 



come perhaps more varied in their interest. The 
treatment comprises four << Ages," that of Words- 
worth, to 1815, of Byron, to 1840. the Victorian, to 
1870, and that of Tennyson, to 1900. An Epilogue 
of a few pages follows these four sections, and 
introduces portraits of Mr. Swinburne and Mr. 
Meredith, the two greatest Englishmen left us, who 
might not be otherwise included because of the for- 
tunate circumstance that they are still alive. An 
Appendix gives texts of the Old English facsimiles^ 
and translations of the early MSS. and letters. An 
elaborate index to the whole four volumes completes 
the work. 

Feathered life ^^ ^^r very gratifying account of the 
in the land " Birds of California " (McClurg) 

o/tunthine. Mtb. Irene Grosvenor Wheelock has 

shown herself possessed of prime qualities as a stu- 
dent of nature. She has enthusiasm, patience, an 
instinct for close observation, and a capacity for 
arduous labor. Added to these qualities she has 
an easy and picturesque habit of narration which 
allows the interest of her readers no opportunity 
for flagging. Often as she has to relate the indi- 
vidual story of a group of beings with marked dis- 
similarity in traits and manners, she escapes the 
peril of monotony by admirable tact in the man- 
agement of incident and in the choice of felicitous 
phraseology. It was a somewhat daring venture to 
follow in a special field of research so recently and 
ably covered by Mrs. Florence M. Bailey, whose 
" Manual of Birds of the Western United States " 
is accepted as a standard in this department of 
American ornithology. Yet the present writer has 
not imitated or duplicated the achievement of her 
predecessor. She has produced a distinctly original 
work, which proves its raison d'etre by the amount 
of novel information it presents. In this, as in her 
previous popular book on "Nestlings of Forest and 
Marsh," Mrs. Wheelock pays particular attention 
to the babies in the bird world. It is with refer- 
ence to them rather than to the adult that she di- 
rects her investigations, intent upon observing the 
entire course of their development under the care 
and tutelage of the parent. It is a wonder how she 
comes upon so many intimate domestic scenes in 
the life of the birds, how she finds so many skilfully 
hidden homes and guarded secrets in their careful 
keeping. Her book is^the reward of a faithful 
watcher, up with the dawn and out all day long, in 
the fields and the forests, on the water and the 
mountain tops, never stopping for any obstacle that 
a woman's wit and will can overcome. There is 
little mention made of the difficulty and fatigue en- 
countered, but this may be read between the lines. 
It is pleasant to note that so much fruitful work 
was accomplished without the use of a gun. There 
was not a single instance, among the three hundred 
species described, of the murder of a bird or the 
ravage of a nest. Mrs. Wheelock adds substantial 
testimony to the theory that the school is a regular 
institution among wild animals, and that their young

are trained by persistent discipline to walk in the 
way they should go. She was a frequent witness 
of the lessons in swimming, feeding, flying, and 
singing which the parent bird deems essential to 
the proper education of the fledgling. She like- 
wise furnishes considerable support to the lately- 
discovered fact that many young birds in the nest 
are fed by regurgitation for a length of time vary- 
ing with the species. She records a hundred and 
eighty cases in which the young hatched in a naked 
or semi-naked condition were fed in this manner 
for at least three days. Vultures were so fed for 
ten days, and a few, such as humming-birds and 
swallows, as long as they remained in the nest. 
Mrs. Wheelock has secured in Mr. Bruce Horsfall 
the help of a competent artist for the illustrations 
accompanying her narrative. These number ten 
full-page plates and seventy-eight text-drawings. 
The publishers have earned a full share of com- 
mendation by the rich and handsome dress in which 
they have clothed the book. 

A judiciously selected group of the 
^PZlZt masterpieces of English and Amer- 

ican legal literature, including fo- 
rensic arguments and judicial and professional 
-opinions presented during the nineteenth century 
and the closing half of the eighteenth, has been 
arranged and edited by Mr. Van Vechten Veeder, 
and published under the title of " Legal Master- 
pieces " (Keefe- Davidson Company, St. Paul). The 
purpose of the collection, as expressed by the editor, 
" is to bring together, from the whole field of legal 
literature, specimens of the best models of the va- 
rious forms of discourse and composition in which 
the lawyer's work is embodied." This purpose, of 
illustrating precisely how great jurists have argued 
great questions, has been well attained in these two 
volumes of upwards of 1300 pages. The forensic 
efforts selected are worthy of being gathered into 
such an anthology. Though it is not an exhaustive 
collection, and one misses some favorites and notes 
the absence from the group of such orators and 
advocates as Seward and Garfield and Prentiss, yet 
-it would not be easy to exclude any whom the editor 
has admitted into bis circle. Selections are made 
from the leading efforts of seven of the foremost 
British jurists of the period indicated, among whom 
are Erskine, Curran, and Brougham. Erskine is 
represented in five great arguments, first of which, 
in more than one respect, is that in defense of 
Lord George Gordon against the charge of treason. 
Hamilton, Marshall, Webster, and Curtis are prom- 
inent among the twelve American jurists whose 
forensic work is here accorded place. The selections 
are by no means averaged in number among the 
speakers represented. Chief Justice Marshall and 
Lord Bowen each contribute four judicial opinions, 
and Webster, O'Conor, and Evarts each three legal 
arguments ; while Erskine is drawn upon for five 
similar efforts, and Curtis furnishes three arguments 
at the bar, one opinion as judge, and one charge to 



the jury — five contributions in all. In the selec- 
tions made from this class of professional work, the 
subjects of Constitutional Law and International 
Law are naturally favorites. Webster's persuasive 
addresses in the Dartmouth College case and the 
Rhode Island controversy of Luther vs. Borden, 
Hamilton's convincing opinion in favor of the char- 
ter of the Bank of the United States, and David 
Dudley Field's earnest argument in the McCardle 
case, present worthily the possibilities of American 
Constitutional Jurisprudence. Evarts's argument 
in behalf of the United States before the Geneva 
Arbitration Tribunal recalls a notable episode in 
modern International Law. This great subject is 
the one with which Mr. Veeder's collection appro- 
priately opens, in Lord Mansfield's answer to the 
Prussian Memorial (anno 1753), and with which it 
closes in James C. Carter's argument before the 
Bering Sea Fur Seal Commission (anno 1893). 
Students will welcome the opportunity to secure and 
preserve, in this form, these masterpieces of legal 
literature, most of which have heretofore been ac- 
cessible only in the dry and dusty " reports." The 
collection is rounded out and made symmetrical by 
brief biographical sketches of these masters of fo- 
rensic oratory, in which the reader is made easily 
acquainted with the personality of each of the au- 
thors, and with the leading facts of his career and 
his labors and achievements as a jurist.

seldom been the subjects of biography. The " Life 
and Letters of Margaret Preston " (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.) will find many sympathetic readers. 
Margaret Preston is known as the author of some 
stirring war-lyrics, and as a contributor to various 
magazines ; and her life was one of unusual interest. 
Of Northern parentage and association in early life, 
she married Colonel John Preston, who was sub- 
sequently on Stonewall Jackson's staff. As the wife 
of Colonel Preston, the sister-in-law of General 
Jackson, and the daughter of a stanch Abolitionist 
clergyman, Margaret Preston was tried between 
loyalty to her father and to her husband, to her 
native and her adopted State. With courageous 
strength and gentle pride, she stood by her hus- 
band and his cause in the hour of their greatest 
trial. And herein lies the chief value of her pub- 
lished biography, — that although in manners and 
customs she was thoroughly Southern, she saw the 
strenuous life of the Southern women in war-time 
from a sympathetic Northern woman's point of 
view. While one can speak, not unappreciatively, 
of her biographer's " magnified epitaph," one can 
read only with keen delight the almost wholly auto- 
biographic chapters entitled "A Journal of War 
Times " and " Post-Bellum Days." In these chap- 
ters are a gentle woman's thoughts of the suffering 
innocent ; of woman's hand at man's work ; and of 
the weariness and cruelty of war. These chapters

have other attractions : pictures of Jackson, Lee, 
Maury ; the prices of household stuffs ; accounts 
of the occupation of the home tovrn hy Federal 
troops ; the shifts to which the women were driven 
to make life hearahle, — all making an interesting 
and instructive commentary on woman's life in the 
South during the days of war and reconstruction. 
If the author and editor of the volume had given 
more of the Journal, and fewer letters, omitting 
even the correspondence with Longfellow, Whittier, 
Burroughs, and Jean Ingelow, she would have added 
to the interest of the book. The correspondence 
between Paul Hayne and Mrs. Preston is of inter- 
est only so far as it adds to our information of the 
struggles of Southern literary men, — a struggle 
only too well known in the cases of Poe, Timrod, 
and Lanier. The Life and Letters of Mrs. Preston 
are prepared for publication by her step-daughter, 
Elizabeth Preston Allan. Another Southerner, 
Professor James A. Harrison, has written a thirty- 
seven page appendix in praise of Mrs. Preston as 
a woman and as a poet. As to her womanly quali- 
ties, there can be no dispute ; but of her poetry 
there can hardly as yet be a final decision. If any 
of her poems are to live, it seems likely that they 
will be those written in the white-heat of her 
"Journal of War Times." 



The Catholic 
revival in 
England. 



A glance at the table of contents of 
Mr. Wilfrid Ward's " Problems and 
Persons " (Longmans, Green, & Co.) 
promises more of general interest than the book 
itself fulfils, for the simple reason that most of the 
essays reprinted here are now several years behind 
the times. And yet this very fact, coupled with the 
knowledge that at the time of their writing — in no 
case more than eight years ago — Mr. Ward was 
well abreast of the age, adds weight to the author's 
main argument, that theology, the most nearly 
changeless of the sciences, has fallen into line with 
the other sciences in a gradual process of evolution. 
Of the eleven essays that compose the volume, the 
majority deal with this problem in its various phases, 
— " The Time Spirit of the Nineteenth Century," 
" The Rigidity of Rome," "Unchanging Dogma and 
Changeful Man," and "The Foundations of Belief," 
these abstract discussions being supplemented by 
the more concrete illustrations of the life-work of 
Cardinals Newman and Wiseman. The book is 
essentially a history of the Catholic revival in En- 
gland, its causes and its leaders. But to-day we 
take for granted what seemed like a new revela- 
tion, even to progressive theologians, at the time 
when Mr. Ward's essays were written, — namely, 
that the Semper eadem of the Catholic Church is 
not identical with nnplastic rigidity, but is thor- 
oughly compatible with the assimilation of contem- 
porary scientific principles. " The evolutionary 
view, which broke up the old supposition as to the 
fixity of theology, brings its own compensation. A 
fixed theology, viewed as final, was the analogue to 
a view of the universe which failed in other depart- 



ments to grasp evolution as a fact. An avowedly 
living and developing theology, on the other hand, 
— a theology viewed as consisting of ideas capable of 
organic growth, the symbolic expression of a living 
and lasting Divine truth, — is the analogue to a sci- 
ence which contemplates and investigates the laws 
of evolution in all other departments." But we no 
longer recognize any other than the evolutionary 
theology ; and while the history is interesting, the 
argument is wasted. Cardinal Newman and Car- 
dinal Wiseman have done their work so well that 
many of their most advanced and radical theories 
are accepted, and even enlarged, by those for whom 
the great men hoped only to prepare the way to- 
ward a future understanding. So rapidly all sci- 
ence, even the science of theology, has moved in 
the last generation. The essay devoted to the life- 
work of Cardinal Wiseman and his personal char- 
acterization is easily the most interesting and the 
most vital in the book, — the other essays concerning 
Persons, including the Tennyson and Huxley re- 
miniscences, seeming somewhat out of place, and 
adding nothing definite to our knowledge of the 
men beyond some interesting personal anecdotes. 

mu, volumes in The latest issues of Mr. Archer 
the"Hisiorie Butler Hulbert's series of " Historic 

Highway*" series. Highways" (Arthur H. Clark Co., 
Cleveland) are volumes seven and nine, — the pub- 
lication of an omitted volume, relating to Military 
Roads, having been postponed for further in- 
vestigation. Volume seven relates to " Portage 
Paths," which are strikingly characterized as "The 
Keys of the Continent." It is divided into two 
parts. Part I. gives a description of portages^ 
those between the headwaters of rivers and those 
around obstructions in rivers, and a history of 
portages, their use by Indians and the early ex 
plorers, their strategic importance in the struggle 
between the red and white man and their later em- 
ployment for roads and canals. Part II. gives a 
list of twenty-nine portages, with particular descrip- 
tions of some of them. The first, connecting the 
St. John with the Bay of Chaleur, is not so de- 
scribed; and the last, connecting Lake Superior 
with Hudson's Bay by way of the Lake of the 
Woods, has apparently been "pied" by the printer. 
The intervening portages, except for those around 
Niagara Falls, consist of two classes, — those 
between the St. Lawrence or the Lakes and the 
Atlantic rivers, and those connecting the Lakes 
with the tributaries of the Ohio and the Mississippi. 
There is a good account of the Oneida portage, but 
many of the other descriptions are very meagre. — 
Volume nine, entitled "Waterways of Western 
Expansion," is entirely devoted to the Ohio and its 
tributaries. It treats of the expedition of C^loron 
de Bienville, the extinction of Indian title in Ohio, 
the diflficulties of river navigation, the evolution of 
river craft from the canoe and pirogue to the flat- 
boat, keel-boat, and steam-boat, the character of suc- 
cessive generations of rivermen, and the expenditures

of the federal government for the improvement of 
the navigation of the Ohio. The title "Our First 
Glimpse of the Ohio," which the Cdloron chapter 
bears, conveys the erroneous impression that Euro- 
pean knowledge of the river began with that expe- 
dition. The Indian treaties of 1785 and 1786, 
recounted in the second chapter, were never carried 
into effect, but were superseded by the treaty of 
Greenville. The extracts from " The Navigator " 
suggest some account of that publication, and of 
other river-guides ; but none is given. We natur- 
ally look for narratives of pioneer voyages down 
the river, but do not find them. Both of the vol- 
umes exhibit the merits and the faults of the earlier 
ones. They are entertaining and suggestive, but 
are so far from complete that the reader cannot 
resist the conclusion that the work has been pushed 
too rapidly. The publishers have decided to break 
a hundred sets of the series, so that, for a time at 
least, the volumes may be had separately. 

The second volume of Mr. Charles 
HUtoryofthe Qman's " History of the Peninsular 

Peninsular War. -rrr ,> ^r\ r •, tt • • -n \ • 

War (Oxford University Fress) is 
of even larger bulk than was the first. This is due 
mainly to the existence of much more original ma- 
terial for the campaigns of 1809 than was found 
for 1808, and to the fact that the unity of treatment 
hitherto permissible is prohibited in 1809 by the 
multiplication of the centres of military activity. 
In the later year the campaigns in some degree 
ceased to be national, and became local and isolated. 
Each of these local campaigns have been treated 
with infinite pains in exact statement, and with the 
same genius for military detail evinced in the first 
volume. The cordial reception given that first vol- 
ume has evidently encouraged Mr. Oman to criticise 
more directly and specifically the work of Napier 
as a historian, and such criticism is less apologetic- 
ally stated. Thus, he shows us that Napier's de- 
scription and plan of Wellesley's passage of the 
Douro, in the face of a French army, are wholly 
untrustworthy, and that Napier " had either never 
seen the ground, or had forgotten its aspect after 
the lapse of years." In the case also of the famous 
second siege of Saragossa, Napier's denunciation 
of the incapacity of Palafox is largely disproved by 
Mr. Oman. Palafox, he says, was no doubt ineffi- 
cient in certain details of military engineering, but 
nevertheless had made magnificent preparations for 
the provisioning of the beleaguered city, had created, 
largely by his personal enthusiasm, an intense fanat- 
ical patriotism in the breasts of soldiers and citizens, 
and was, at every critical stage of the siege, the very 
soul of the defense. In the end, Saragossa was 
conquered by typhus, much more than by the as- 
saults of the French. Even in such dramatic in- 
cidents as this siege, it is evident that Mr. Oman's 
principal genius lies in the depiction of purely mili- 
tary movements ; and it is for this that his present 
work must take high rank. Extreme technical 
detail, involving the movements not only of main 



divisions of an army but of mere fragments of a 
division as well, results in somewhat wearisome 
reading at times. But this is inevitable, if one be not 
deeply interested in military technique ; and in any 
event the omission of detail would have deprived 
the author alike of his own chief interest and of 
his distinct service to history. 



Journalism as 
a profession. 



Few men have been better qualified 
to write of the trials and tribulations 
of journalism as a profession than 
was Mr. Julian Ralph. A quarter of a century of 
active experience in the newspaper business in 
America and Europe, not to mention magazine 
work in the lines of travel and descriptive work — 
<< which is closer than a cousinship to newspaper 
work " — has given him an intimate knowledge of 
this field of endeavor. In " The Making of a 
Journalist" (Harper) he has shown us that news- 
paper life is '' not a little subject," and has pointed 
out how widely one can stray without losing touch 
of it. *' Napoleon not only depended upon the press 
to prepare France for his plans and to execute many 
of them, but he directed and worked the newspapers 
in a way which was instinct with the spirit and 
genius of journalism. Bismarck's death leaves him 
revealed to us as an editorial manipulator of news- 
papers in a way and to a degree which assures us 
that the spirit of the newspaper man, as well as a 
correct view of the power and processes of the press, 
were his." The author has devoted interesting chap- 
ters to newspaper interviewing, criminal reporting, 
war correspondence, gathering of election returns, 
the mysterious '' sixth sense " in journalism, the 
reporter's power in state and national politics, etc., 
illustrating each with incidents and examples from 
his individual experience. The work has just that 
amount of personal interest which makes us feel 
that we are taken into the confidence of the writer, 
and does not assume that ex cathedra tone which 
one frequently encounters in the writings of a spe- 
cialist on any subject. 



Elements of 
architectural 
criticism. 



Architecture is the youngest of the 
arts in America, and a popular knowl- 
edge and appreciation of it are as 
yet undeveloped among us. Hence a book written 
in popular language, giving some of the principles 
of architectural criticism, is timely and should prove 
useful. Mr. Russell Sturgis is not only the leading 
critic of architecture in this country, but he has, 
through his "Dictionary of Architecture," made 
himself an acknowledged authority upon all archi- 
tectural subjects. His essays in elementary archi- 
tectural criticism, in " How to Judge Architecture" 
(Baker & Taylor Co.), are entitled to a wide read- 
ing ; and the book, with its admirable illustrations, 
numbering more than eighty, is a valuable contri- 
bution to the rapidly growing number of hand- 
books of art education. It is just possible that Mr. 
Sturgis is too fine a critic, and too much of an 
expositor of his art, to treat the subject in a popu- 



162

lar manner; and though he seeks, by foot-note 
definitions of every technical term he uses, to make 
his meaning perfectly clear, he may yet fail to bring 
to the gentle art of criticism many followers from 
the ranks of the laity. Perhaps, however, this is 
only to be said after a comparison of his work with 
such a book as Statham's "Architecture for General 
Readers," which must hold its own as a popular 
educator wherever it is known. But Mr. Sturgis's 
book is entitled to high praise, and will tend to a 
more general understanding of the subject.

which was published more than two-score years ago, 
is supplied by Mr. Bayard Tuckerman (Dodd,

has been collected, it is claimed, from the papers 
and order-book of General Schuyler, from the Gates 
papers in the New York Historical Society, and 
from the archives of the Department of State in 
Washington. The early part of Schuyler's life has 
a just proportion, but his military services in the 
old French and the Revolutionary wars make up 
the bulk of the volume. His civic services in later 
life are reduced to a minimum. The Gates-Schuyler 
rivalry occupies many pages, the substitution of the 
former for the latter in the Northern command 
being attributed to the unwillingness of the New 
England troops to serve under " the Dutchman," 
with his strict discipline and military order, and to 
the persistent intrigue of Gates himself. Washing- 
ton is represented as listening to " one-sided ac- 
counts " in certain instances where Schuyler was 
concerned. The writer confesses that Schuyler 
lacked genius or extraordinary talent of any kind, 
but finds a praiseworthy motive of genuine love of 
country in his actions.

singularly devoid of general interest. But for the 
fact that the session of the States General in 1614 
was the last meeting of that body before the Revo- 
lution, there is hardly anything that rises above the 
level of personal intrigues. Dr. A. P. Lord, who 
presents in his " Regency of Marie de M^dicis " 
(Holt) a study of the years 1610-1616, has evi- 
dently felt this narrowing of interest, and his book 
is mainly concerned with the schemes of the princes. 
He has also tried to throw light upon the exact cir- 
cumstances under which Sully was forced to retire. 
His chapters are based upon a careful study of the 
sources and of the work of the late Professor Ber- 
thold Zelbr. One may venture to ask why he has 
made no apparent use of the two remarkable vol- 
umes of Hanotaux upon the earlier years of Riche- 
lieu, for they contain an important interpretation 
of the period. The volume is enriched by several 
portraits taken from the collection in the Louvre. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A group of Petrarch's sonnets, nine in number, 
together with one canzone, has been translated into- 
English with singular success by Miss Agnes Tobin, 
and published by Mr. Howard Wilford Bell in an 
exquisite and luxurious vellum-bound volume called 
"Love's Crucifix." Miss Tobin's versions are good as 
reproductions and good also as English poems — a 
twofold excellence which translators rarely achieve. A 
series of black and white drawings by Mr. Graham 
Robertson adorn the volume, and are in keeping with 
the charm of the verse. The edition is limited, and 
only one hundred copies are offered for sale in this 
country. 

Two new volumes have just been added to " The 
Musician's Library " by the Oliver Ditson Co. " Forty 
Songs by Johannes Brahms " is edited by Mr. Jamea 
Huneker, and provides a typical representation of the 
work of the composer in all the stages of its develop- 
ment. Mr. August Spanuth is the editor of " Twenty 
Piano Transcriptions by Franz Liszt," which includes 
examples from eleven composers. Among the pieces 
are Paganini's " Campanella," Schubert's "Da Bist 
die Ruh," Verdi's " Rigoletto," and three of the Wagner 
arrangements. Each of these volumes has the usual 
portrait of the composer and a prefatory critical essay. 

It is so long since we have had a new volume in the 
"Cranford Series" (Macmillan) that the appearance 
of Fanny Burney's " Evelina " in this charming setting 
is a pleasure the more to be appreciated because unex- 
pected. Mr. Austin Dobson as editor and Mr. Hugh 
Thomson as illustrator have rarely had a more con- 
genial subject than is afforded them here, and it is 
needless to say that the Introduction of the one and 
the pen-and-ink drawings of the other are thoroughly 
delightful. Often as we may have read " Evelina " be- 
fore, it will be impossible to resist a fresh perusal in 
this latest and best of all editions. 

A " Recueil de Locutions FranQaises," by M. Armand- 
Georges Billaudeau, is published in Paris by MM. 
Boyveau and Chevillet, and supplied to the American 
market by Mr. G. E. Stechert. The work contains 
about fifty thousand French phrases, proverbial, famil- 
iar, or figurative, for which English equivalents are 
provided — a matter of much ingenuity in many of the 
eases. We are bound to say that a good many of the 
English idioms here given have been invented for the 
occasion, but the book, taken with judgment, ought to 
be found exceedingly useful by translators from French 
into English. 

Professor Charles Gide's " Principles of Political 
Economy" was first translated for the use of American 
students about twelve years ago. The work has to a 
singular degree the qualities of lucidity and interest in 
which the French are the masters of the rest of man- 
kind, and at once took its place as one of the very best 
of general treatises upon its subject. A revised Amer- 
ican edition of this book has just been published by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., having been retranslated by 
Dr. C. William A. Veditz from the latest form of the 
original, and adapted for our use (with the author's 
sanction) by the substitution of American illustrative 
material for the French material employed by the 
author. It is a book of singular interest and value, 
and most successfully redeems the subject of economics 
from the charge of being a " dismal " science.

THE DIAL, 



[March 1, 



The February issue of " The Burlington Magazine " 
contains an interesting prospectus of articles planned for 
publication during the present year, including contribu- 
tions from many of the most authoritative art critics of 
the day. The American edition of this magazine de luxe 
now appears with the imprint of the Macmillan Co. 

Volume I. of " Testing of Electro-Magnetic Ma- 
chinery and Other Apparatus," by Messrs. Bernard 
Victor Swenson and Budd Frankenfield, is a practical 
treatise on electrical engineering published by the Mac- 
millan Co. ''Direct Currents" is the special subject 
of this first volume. 

The English "Who's Who" for 1904, being the 
fifty-sixth annual issue of this valuable book of refer- 
ence, is sent us by the Macmillan Co. It records occur- 
rences down to the middle of last September. The 
prefatory tables which formerly accompanied these 
volumes have now disappeared altogether, to be pub- 
lished hereafter in separate form, and the seventeen 
hundred pages of the work now contain biographies 
alone. As we have remarked before, the selection of 
American names is capricious. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons announce that here- 
after their business will be carried on as a corporation 
under the title of Charles Scribner's Sous, Incorporated. 
There will be no change in the management or meth- 
ods of the business, which will go on in all its depart- 
ments as heretofore. Advantage will be taken of the 
opportunity for associating more closely some of those 
who for years have been connected with the organiza- 
tion. The officers of the Company are Charles Scrib- 
ner, president; Arthur H. Scribner, vice-president and 
treasurer; Edwin W. Morse, secretary. 

The Messrs. Scribner will begin publication this 
month of an important series of biographical and crit- 
ical studies of well-known authors of all countries, 
under the general title of " Literary Lives." Dr. W. 
Robertson NicoU is editor of the series, and the first 
two volumes, on Matthew Arnold and Cardinal Newman, 
are the work of Mr. G. W. E. Russell and Dr. William 
Barry respectively. Early volumes are promised by 
Mr. W. Hale White on John Bunyan, Mr. Clement K. 
Shorter on Charlotte Bronte, Dr. Nicoll on R. M. 
Hutton, Professor Edward Dowden on Goethe, and Miss 
Louise Imogen Guiney on William Hazlitt. 

"The Shorter Poems of Alfred Tennyson," edited by 
Mr. Charles Read Nutter, and Book I. of Spenser's 
" Faerie Queene," edited by Professor George Arm- 
strong Wauchope, are two new " Pocket Classics " pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. Other English texts for 
school use are " Macbeth," edited by Mr. George Smith, 
and "The Tempest," edited by Mr. Oliphant Smeaton, 
published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.; "The Mer- 
chant of Venice," edited by Dr. William J. Rolfe, pub- 
lished by the American Book Co.; and Macaulay's 
"Life of Samuel Johnson," edited by Mr. Charles Lane 
Hanson, published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Publication of their complete and definitive edition of 
the Journals of Lewis and Clark will soon be begun by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., under the editorship of Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites. The original journals of the 
expedition are now in the possession of the American 
Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. Although these 
journals have formed the basis for many published ac- 
counts of the expedition, it is claimed they have never 
before been made public in the exact form and manner 
in which they were actually written by the explorers. 
A still more remarkable fact is, according to the 



publishers' statement, that the accounts heretofore pub- 
lished have been not only more of a paraphrase than a 
reproduction, but they have totally ignored a great 
mass of valuable information. It is said that the forth- 
coming edition will include much important material! 
heretofore unpublished.

read like the gospels of the New Testament in their original form.

revolutionary so far as modern op'''''-n5 are concerned; but actually the results are conservative, being in the 
main a return to ancient op)nv>i The composition of the various Gospels also becomes much easier of 
explanation and the entire subject acquires new results. The book is not technical, and it has been so written

TOMASO'S FORTUNE And Other Stories 

By HENRY SETON MERRIMAN, Author of " Barlasch of the Guards," etc. 
A VOLUME of nearly a score of short stories left at his death, by Mr. Merriman, all of them possessing, to 
a surprising degree, the qualities that have made his novels acceptable to such a multitude of readers. 
The book shows him as much the master of the short story as of the novel. $1.50. 



THE TEST 

By MARY TAPPAN WRIGHT 12nio. $1.50. 

A POWERFUL novel of contemporary American life by a writer of very individual and original talent. 

The singular intensity and power to move, shown repeatedly in "Aliens," are here at their strongest, 

and the situations in "The Test" are such as to call out all Mrs. Wright's exceptional literary art. $1.50. 



PEACE AND THE VICES 

By ANNA A. ROGERS 12ino. $1.50. 

A NOVEL of American Navy life pleasantly relieved by a love-story of much originality. Humor, feeling, 
power, dramatic interest, suspense, are all here, blended in just such nicely balanced proportions as one 
would expect from the author of " Sweethearts and Wives." 



THE PASTIME OF ETERNITY 

By BEATRIX DEMAREST LLOYD IZmo, $1.50. 

'T'HE story this new writer here tells and the notable group of new characters she has created should insure 

h€r a large audience. New York is the scene, and the central figure a man of wealth and leisure whose 

life, through his temperament and an unfortunate marriage, has fallen into a tragic gulf of isolation. It is a 

novel of distinguished charm and interest, $1.^0. 



THE PANCHRONICON 

By HAROLD STEELE MACKAYE 12mo. $1.50. 

IT is obvious that, given an aerial machine flying westward at a higher rate of speed than that of the Earth's 
diurnal revolution, it would be possible to revisit the past. The conception is worthy of Stockton, and 
Mr. Mackaye is as amusing as he is ingenious. Nothing could be more humorous than the picture of the 
Court of Elizabeth confronting the phonograph, the bicycle, the modern newspaper, and the Bacon-Shakes- 
peare controversy. $1.50.

WHEN WILDERNESS WAS KING 

With 6 full-page The stirring events of the Fort Dearborn massacre in 1812 have long 
illustrations been waiting for some one to use them as material for a novel. Mr. 
the KINNEYS Parrish has made the most of the great possibilities, and against a 
dramatic background of frontier courage and savage cruelty he has 
worked out the love story of John Wayland. It begins very early in the book, and 
until almost the end there seems no way of establishing the identity of the illusive fig- 
ure which Wayland has always before him, but never quite within his grasp. Not to 
know who the maiden is and where she can be found makes it much more complicated 
for John Wayland — and more interesting for the reader. It is above all else a good 
story^ swift, sustained, and well told. In all essential particulars it is uniform with " The 
Thrall of Leif the Lucky " and " The Ward of King Canute." $1.50

the hero — of a romance, until Mr. Orcutt recognized the unusual 
possibilities in the adventurous life and tragic death of the daring explorer. It is a 
beautiful and vivid romance, with sharply contrasted scenes in Old France and New 
France — the glittering, frivolous court at Versailles and the stern privation and strug- 
gle in the forest wilderness. Mechanically the book is beautifully made, having illus-

The Most Important and Interesting Book of the Year 



AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY 

Herbert Spencer 



With many Illustrations. 2 vols., 8vOy cloth, $5.50 net; postage additional 



An American friend of Spencer, who has read the book, says: 

" It is as broad and many-sided as human experience, and the marvel and charm 
of it is its simple, straightforward, and obvious truthfulness. It seems to me to exceed 
any of his former works in interest and practical value; and I have been a constant 
reader of his writings from their first publication in this country. Mr. Spencer's 
supreme loyalty to truth and his native frankness have made his account of his life 
very open and unreserved. Lest he might err in this direction he got the advice of 
confidential friends. After reading it and approving it entirely, Huxley remarked that 
it reminded him of the ' Confessions ' of Rousseau, without any of the objectionable 
features of that work. 

" Mr. Spencer knew intimately some of the leading people of his time," and where 
the interest warranted it he has given his impressions of them. There are several 
pages of absorbing interest concerning George Eliot, whom he knew for years before 
she became so eminent as an author, and for whom he had the highest appreciation. 
The estimate of her character and ability from one so capable of judging, and one who 
knew her so well, is a distinct gain to the world. His intimates of the club, and 
especially Huxley and Tyndall, receive his friendly attention. The chapters upon 
Huxley and Tyndall will be read with deep interest. His analysis of their qualities is a 
fine example of that kind of work."

court, runs like a poem through a narrative alive with 
stirring incidents of the days of Sir Walter Raleigh, when 
all England loved, sang, adventured, and fought in the 
flush of youthful power.

THE THEATRE AND THE DRAMA. 

Gotthold Lessing gave the best of his life's 
energies, critical and creative, to upbuilding 
the German stage. Yet towards the close of 
his career, when anyone mentioned the thea- 
tre to him, he would say, " You bore me," and 
would shut his eyes and go to sleep. Some of 
us, who, though without Lessing's claim and 
authority, have thought and wrought for the 
American stage, feel like echoing his behavior. 

What are the causes of the unquestioned 
feebleness and futility of the American theatre. 
Abroad, in Germany, France, Italy, — even in 
England, — there is a dramatic and theatric 
renaissance. The Scandinavian countries have 
been for nearly a century, indeed since the 
great Danish outburst in Oehlenschlager, the 
homes of a flourishing and splendid drama. 
Only in America the to-day of the stage seems 
barren, the to-morrow blank. 

There are, of course, general causes at work 
to account for our weakness in the drama, as in 
every other high field of thought and work. 
The dramatic art is particularly and above all 
others the imaginative art. It shows the real 
world the door, and welcomes with outstretched 
arms the fancy-created universe of our hopes 
and fears. " A poor gentleman," says Hazlitt, 
" who lacks a guinea may best make up for his 
want by a half crown seat at the theatre." An 
American would rather have the guinea in his 
breeches pocket than the gilded vision in his 
brain. We are in truth a prosaic people, the 
pupils or victims of our philosopher and law- 
giver Benjamin Franklin. To me Franklin 
seems the modern embodiment of Milton's 
Mammon — "the least erected spirit that fell." 
Or perhaps his better prototype could be found 
in Sixteen String Jack. 

Another cause of our failure in the drama is 
our want of a central seat of opinion, where 
those capable of the best effort could gather 
and win recognition and reward. Every great 
drama of the past, I think, has risen in a cap- 
ital—a capital of wit if not of rule. But 
America is like a man who has seven or eight 
heads growing out of his body, each one of 
them wishing to go its own way and to do its 
own will. It is possible, I should say, that if 
some American town, which has resigned, or

does not care for, supremacy in commerce, 
manufactures, or wealth, would set up and sup- 
port a theatrical establishment, where the best 
only of new and old plays should be presented, 
it might lift its head above the other cities of 
our realm and make the American people walk 
its way. Concentration and direction are the 
first requisites of success in any field of effort. 

Direction ! That indeed is the knot of the 
difficulty. Who is to direct the work that 
must be done to build up a great drama and 
stage in our country ? There is a story in Le 
Sage which is so apropos here that it is worth 
retelling. Gil Bias and his friend Fabrieius 
have attended the very successful first night of 
a new play, and after the performance are in- 
vited by the actors to take supper with them. 
As they are sitting at the table there comes a 
gentle knock on the door. The leading actor 
gets up and opens it and admits a timid, cring- 
ing, shabby person who has a roll under his 
arm. The actor takes the roll, dismisses the 
intruder with a few frowning words, and sits 
down again. " Who was that ? " asks Fabrieius. 
" Oh," says the actor, " that was the poor devil 
whose play we performed to-night." 

Human nature never alters. As long as it 
is popular favor which gives the wreaths and 
rewards, it is the executant who will gather 
these in and assume the authority. As long as 
the movable booths of wandering players were 
the only platforms for the Spanish playwright, 
Cervantes, with his marvellous dramatic power, 
had to starve. But the moment the Court and 
Inquisition found they needed a theatre, it was 
possible for Lope and Calderon to take the 
port of princes. As long as the cart of 
Thespis was the vehicle of the drama, we hear 
nothing of poets. But when the Athenians 
dedicated a great free theatre, and made it 
an institution of the state, JBschylus and his 
successors took their place of highest citizen- 
ship. As long as the Elizabethan dramatists 
depended solely on popular favor, Greene, 
Peele, Marlowe, and others were the poor and 
unregarded servants of the actors. But when 
Shakespeare succeeded, as undoubtedly he 
must have done, in gaining for his " back " 
a clique of powerful nobles, he could make 
himself respected and wealthy. Goethe and 
Schiller might have been compelled to write 
Robber Dramas or Domestic Comedies all 
their lives to gain a few thalers, had not the 
support of the Weimar Court given them a 
theatre through which they could dominate 
Germany. Wagner had to freeze in isolation. 



unacted and unsung, the mock of managers and 
singers, until Ludwig of Bavaria gave him his 
opportunity to enchant the world. 

It is perfectly natural that when the acclaim 
of the crowd throws the sceptre into the actor's 
hand, he should wield it as if it belonged to 
him of right ; and he should dominate the sit- 
uation. But that it is bad for him in the end 
to .be the master of the theatre is certain. He 
cannot create, in any real sense ; he can but 
execute. Yet, being at the top of fortune, it is 
only human instinct in him which makes him 
refuse to be ordered and lessoned by a superior. 
Yet he depends on the dramatic poet for his 
opportunities. He cannot shine in his bor- 
rowed brilliancy unless the dramatist gives him 
a role. It is as though the moon should de- 
cide that the headship of the sky belonged to 
it, and should succeed in putting the sun Into 
obscurity. To take one instance of the suprem- 
acy of the poet : — How many theatres has 
Wagner opened ? how many players and sing- 
ers has he made famous ? what a huge train 
of people has he given employment to ? If the 
American stage is to be reformed, it Is neces- 
sary that the actor should realize that he is 
mainly an Instrument; that the breath which 
fills him, the life to which he is lifted, comes 
from another. 

I have said that the actor does not create. 
It might be interesting to try to draw out a 
little just what he does do, what his services 
to the author are. In the first place he pub- 
lishes the play : prints it on the general mind 
not by the use of little, wriggling, black marks 
on a piece of paper, but by means of the human 
voice, by the embodiment in stately or beauti- 
ful human figures, by the accompaniment of 
appropriate scenery. The most imaginative 
minds will, perhaps, always prefer the printed 
page as giving the most scope for perfected 
visions. But to the mass of mankind the 
theatrical ensemble is the more vivid realiza- 
tion. So far, however, no great credit is due 
to the actor. He is engaged to recite certain 
lines and give them the benefit of his action 
and elocution. In the degree to which his 
action and elocution interpret or improve his 
part he may claim partnership with the poet. 
The first stage is where he merely fills out 
his role with his own passion and emotion. 
This is the stage of training and temperament, 
and is so engaging and satisfying that few 
actors rise above it. When Kean put an 
indescribable fire and fury into Richard's 
exclamations " What do they in the North "; 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



189 



or when he leaped upon the stage in the quarrel 
scene of " Othello " and silenced the angry 
combatants by the mere majesty of his pres- 
ence ; or when Booth recited the last speeches 
of Macbeth with such haunting melody of elo- 
cution that each word seemed falling from 
Fate's very lips ; — in these cases there was 
practically nothing original added to the poet's 
work. He might reasonably claim such inter- 
pretation, and the mere imagination of the pri- 
vate reader might give him as much or more. 

But there is a second stage of theatrical 
effort where the artist on the boards does add 
to and does improve upon his author. In a 
certain scene of " Coriolanus," Volumnia has 
nothing to do but to walk across the stage. 
But she has just heard of her son's victory 
over the Volscians, and Mrs. Siddons, in play- 
ing the part, came floating across the back- 
ground as if transported with exultant pride — 
her head triumphant, her bosom swelling, and 
her step like goddess on the clouds. Again, 
in the last scene of " Measure for Measure," 
when justice has been done and the judgments 
meted out, Madame Modjeska as Isabella 
gradually retires into the background and 
seeks to steal away. Her work is over, and 
she claims no reward. This is as good as a 
new speech by Shakespeare. Again, Adelaide 
Neilson, in the balcony scene of " Romeo and 
Juliet," suddenly seized the roses growing on 
the trellis below her and, pressing them first to 
her bosom, flung them down to Romeo. Again, 
when Charlotte Cushman in " Macbeth " came 
forth to meet Duncan before the gates of her cas- 
tle her body had the sinuous grace of a serpent 
and her eyes were unutterable, fiilled seemingly 
with visions of hell. In all these cases the mind 
of the player cooperated with the dramatist. 
The player was an illustrator who had flashed 
a new picture forth which must henceforward 
be bound up with the book. He, or she, was 
a critic who had made a new study of his 
author, which must be accepted as admirable 
and true. Yet even in these cases of lofty 
effort put forth by the actor, his work remains 
a commentary, a gloss, a realization, of some- 
thing which can again be commented upon, 
glossed, or realized. 

The player, then, on the whole, must be ac- 
counted the dramatist's shadow. We see this 
plainly enough in his relations with authors of 
the past, but in the matter of playwrights of 
to-day we are content to crown the shadow in 
the foreground and let it dominate the real 
being behind. 



I have said nothing as to the part of the 
Manager in working for or against dramatic 
literature. I think there is very little to say. 
The Manager under our American system is 
hardly more than the agent of the player. An 
actor or actress who is known or famous can 
practically dictate what plays he or she will 
appear in. 

The results of our American system of 
theatrical management are threefold. In the 
first place we have no dramatic literature ; 
whereas nearly every country in Europe has 
a mass of splendid art in this kind, — art 
which will be remembered when our tariff- 
built fortunes have taken themselves wings, 
and when our strenuous politics are forgotten 
save in the memories of hate which they have 
aroused. In the second place the intelligence 
of America has largely abandoned the theatre. 
The intelligence of America knows the old 
plays by heart, and its actors refuse to produce 
any new ones which have a suspicion of intel- 
lect in them. In the third place, the decadence 
has affected the players themselves. Many 
good ones have had to sink to the vaudeville 
stage, and the greater ones — who, in a meas- 
ure, have tried to uphold the traditions and 
dignity of their art — do not get the proper 
support. But their own determination to put 
the cart before the horse, to place the servant 
in the master's seat, has very largely contrib- 
uted to such results. 

What is the remedy ? There is only one an- 
swer, — the State organization of the theatre. 
Theory! Idealism! A democracy will never 
consent to such a project ! Well, then, a de- 
mocracy will have to do without a dramatic lit- 
erature or a decent stage. Democracies have 
organized the theatre before — in Greece, in 
France. Our own Democracy is just now en- 
gaged in organizing a Free Library service all 
over our country. The theatre is hardly less 
important. It is absolutely certain that good 
dramatic literature — literature which tells and 
will live — cannot be made to pay on a basis 
of popular support. It is also certain, and very 
natural, that actors have more concern to make 
their own livings and fortunes and fames than 
to produce plays and impersonate characters 
which are for the public good. The direction 
of their efforts must be from above. They must 
be assured of adequate support, and dramatists 
must be encouraged to produce, if the nation 
is to have any real use of the mighty powers 
which lie latent in the theatre.

President Roosevblt as a Hero.* 



The two recent books devoted to the charac- 
ter and career of Theodore Roosevelt, presi- 
dent of the United States through the lamen- 
table taking off of William McKinley and 
candidate for election to that exalted office, 
cannot be said to be authentic history or even 
biography, nor do they disclose any facts of 
importance not previously known. All that 
Mr. Jacob A. Riis and Mr. Francis E. Leupp 
have demonstrated in their readable volumes 
is Mr. Roosevelt's ability to make and hold his 
friends, — among them the authors of these two 
books, both men of integrity who are also ac- 
complished writers. Both profess the utmost 
admiration for Mr. Roosevelt, both plead their 
friendship and even intimacy, and their vol- 
umes may be taken as in a real sense official 
and inspired. By curious chance the titles of 
the two could be exchanged to advantage in 
the interests of accuracy, since Mr. Riis deals 
much more with Mr. Roosevelt as a man, and 
Mr. Leupp rather with his career as a citizen. 

Mr. Riis is a veritable Boswell, but with a 
difference. The Scot, however sycophantic, took 
pains to present a complete portrait, showing a 
man with many of the characteristics of great- 
ness, but still fully human and with human 
frailties and liabilities to err ; Mr. Riis calls 
Mr. Roosevelt " my hero," he discloses perfec- 
tions only, and in his partisanship does not 
scruple to condemn those who see with eyes 
less blinded by devotion. No occupant of the 
Holy See sitting ex cathedra is more infallible 
than his hero; and, unlike the successors of 
Saint Peter, he brings him out impeccable as 
well. For all Mr. Riis's Americanism, — and 
in other respects it is hardly to be called in 
question, — this adopted citizen seems to have 
ingrained in his character a feudal devotion to 
princes. The inference is not forced, as may 
lae seen in the following bit of interpretation of 
childish notions, describing an incident of a re- 
ception in a little Kansas town : 

"The little fellow squirmed and squirmed in the 
grasp of the President's hand, twisting this way and 
that, in desperate search of something, until Mr. 
Roosevelt asked him whom he was looking for. 

" « The President,' gasped the lad, twisting harder to

get away, for fear he would lose his chance. And then 
the look of amazed incredulity that came into his face 
when the man who still bad him by the hand said that 
he was the President. He must have felt as I did when 
I first met King Christian in Copenhagen, and learned 
who the man in the blue overcoat was, with whom I had 
such a good time telling him all about my boyish am-

stairs to the picture exhibition in the palace of Cbar- 
lottenburg. The idea of a real king in an overcoat and 
a plain hat ! I had my doubts about whether he took 
off his crown when he went to bed at night." 

In pleasing contrast to Mr. Riis's thorough- 
going acceptance of Mr. Roosevelt as the wisest 
and best of mankind is Mr. Leupp's prelimi- 
nary declaration, after noting the element in 
him which has been able to turn circumstances 
seemingly adverse to his own advantage, in the 
following paragraph : 

" President Roosevelt is not a genius. He is a man 
of no extraordinary natural capacity. As author, law- 
maker, administrator, huntsman, athlete, soldier, what 
you will, bis record contains nothing that might not 
have been accomplished by any man of sound physique 
and good intelligence. Such prestige as he enjoys 
above his fellows he has acquired partly by hard work 
and partly by using his mother wit in his choice of 
tasks and his method of tackling them. He has simply 
taken up and completed what others have dropped in 
discouragement, sought better ways of doing what 
others have done before, labored always in the open, and 
remembered that the world moves." 

It is still to be observed, notwithstanding this, 
that Mr. Leupp allows little or nothing to 
appear in his pages that would not fully jus- 
tify his readers, if uninformed otherwise, in 
bestowing upon Mr. Roosevelt the full wreath 
of genius. But his arguments toward that 
end are directed to the intelligence for the 
most part, and not, like Mr. Riis's, to the pre- 
judices and sentiments. Mr. Leupp is still an 
American in his attitude. 

As might be expected, Mr. Riis's prejudices 
lead him into statements easily challenged and 
some comparisons that must be odious. He 
tells for example of a German who saw some 
of the horrors of the Spanish attempts to 
" pacify " Cuba. 

" He could not eat, he could not sleep until he had 
gone straight to Washington to tell there what he had 
witnessed. I can see the black look come into Roose- 
velt's face and hear him muttering under his breath, for 
he, too, had little children that he loved. And the old 
anger wells up in me at the thought of those who would 
have stayed our hand. Better a thousand times war 
with all its horrors than a hell like that. That was mur- 
der, and of women and innocent children. The war that 
avenges such infamy I hail as the messenger of wrath 
of an outraged God." 

Fine language that, and fully humane. But 
where is " the black look in Roosevelt's face " 



1904]

when he reads in the reports from the Philip- 
pines of similar and less excusable outrages 
committed upon innocent women and children 
in Batangas by troops under his own command? 
And why has not Mr. Riis hailed the attempt 
of the feeble Filipinos to prevent and avenge 
these infamies " as the messenger of wrath of 
an outraged God"? 

But where Mr. Riis seems most blind to the 
" other side " of the story is in his unqualified 
praise of Mr. Roosevelt as a civil service re- 
former. He quotes him again and again on 
differing phases of the question, to prove that 
the man who disbelieves in this sensible and 
righteous measure has not a leg to stand on, 
and is an enemy of his country and his kind. 
He sums it up thus : 

" The outcome of it all ? Figures convey no idea of 
it. To say that he fouud 14,000 governmental officers 
under the civil service rules, and left 40,000, does not 
tell the story ; not even in its own poor way, for there 
are 125,000 now, and when the ransomed number 200,- 
000 it will still be Roosevelt's work." 

For Mr. Roosevelt's attitude as Civil Service 
Commissioner, as for that of his colleagues, 
there is little but praise. It should be said, 
however, that his predecessor in the presiden- 
tial office lessened the number of governmental 
employees materially, departing from the ad- 
mirable precedents established by Mr. Cleveland 
during both his terms of office and by Harrison 
as well. But it was reserved for Mr. Roosevelt 
to deal this reform a more desperate blow, by 
striking at its heart. Under section eight of 
civil service rule number eleven, which rule 
prohibits removals for political or religious 
opinions or affiliations, it is specified that no 
removal from the classified civil service of the 
nation shall be made except for just cause, 
upon written charges, and after full notice and 
opportunity to defend. On May 27, 1902, 
President Roosevelt issued an order, of which 
the essential portion follows : 

" The term < just cause ' as used in section 8, civil 
service rule 11, is intended to mean any cause other 
than merely political or religious which will promote 
the efficiency of the service, and nothing contained in 
said rule shall be construed to require the examination 
of witnesses or any trial or hearing except in the dis- 
cretion of the officer making the removal." 

It need not be stated that such a construc- 
tion leaves the administration free to dismiss 
any civil servant with or without cause in the 
sole discretion of " the officer making the re- 
moval," and throws down all the barriers so 
painfully erected against spoilsmen and partis- 
anship. What is worse, it leaves Mr. Roosevelt 



the man open to the charge of standing on both 
sides of a vital question of reform, and turning 
now one way and now the other to his personal 
advantage. Nor is this the sole instance, did 
space avail or the occasion demand. After 
this one may read with a certain amusement 
Mr. Leupp's chapter on Mr. Roosevelt as the 
"Knight-Errant of Civil Service Reform," 
and his enlightening observation that 

«« Mr. Roosevelt's belief in the reformed civil service 
was never the blind faith of a faddist, but always tem- 
pered with practical sense." 

It is significant that both books are largely 
apologies — in the newer sense. Mr. Riis's 
somewhat fatuous statement that Mr. Roosevelt 
should be the unanimous choice of the people 
of the United States for any office he may wish 
to hold is made nugatory by his eagerness to 
anticipate adverse criticism in many particu- 
lars. Mr. Leupp defends the attitude of Mr. 
Roosevelt as president again and again with a 
newspaper man's keener sense of the attacks 
that have been made or are still in the making. 
While a large amount of material is held in 
common by the two, they are still complemen- 
tary to a degree. But it must not be thought 
that because they have neither of them at- 
tempted to tell the whole truth, they are any- 
where intentionally subversive of the truth. 
The real point is that they are writers accus- 
tomed to take one side of a question and push 
it with all the force of their own virile person- 
alities and all the skill of pens long trained to 
controversy. Both frankly admit their prepos- 
sessions, their f];iendship, their affection ; and 
it will readily be granted that the very fact 
that Mr. Roosevelt holds two such men in rela- 
tions so close is no small evidence of his own 
worth. 

Nor is it intended to suggest that the Amer- 
ican people are not adequately represented at 
this time by Mr. Roosevelt and his opportun- 
istic ideas, and that his volunteer biographers 
here are writing for the larger audience in 
meting out praise — unmitigated in the case of 
Mr. Riis, somewhat tempered by wider knowl- 
edge in the case of Mr. Leupp. It is, per- 
haps, too much to expect that personal friends 
should remain silent, or that they should speak 
the whole truth as distinguished from the truth 
as they prefer to contemplate it. This latter 
is the work, as it will become the duty, of the 
historian of the future, and no small share 
of the material in these two interesting, even 
fascinating, volumes will be available for his 
purposes. But it is dangerous to set up an

The Beginnings of Spanish Rule in 
THE Philippine Islands.* 



The publishers of " The Philippine Islands, 
1493-1898 " have taken occasion by the fore- 
lock, and while the popular interest in our new 
Oriental possessions still holds out they have 
launched this ambitious collection of historical 
material. The great usefulness of the work 
cannot be disputed. It will make easily ac- 
cessible to students and investigators the prin- 
cipal documents and contemporary accounts 
upon which our views of Philippine conditions 
and development must be founded. A collec- 
tion of this kind must avoid every appearance 
of trying to establish definitive conclusions, for 
valid inferences can be drawn only after all 
the material has been collected and carefully 
scanned. Nor can the mass of relevant ma- 
terial itself be presented in its entirety in a 
collection like this. The work must, therefore, 
be judged by the carefulness and justice of the 
methods of selection, the faithfulness of repro- 
duction and translation, and the sufficiency of 
the apparatus of critical and explanatory notes. 
It is evident that an approach to perfection in 
a work of this kind can be obtained only by a 
prodigious amount of labor extending over a 
long time. The complete mastery of the doc- 
umentary material by the editors would alone 
require decades of work. Critical comment 
and historical elucidations of the text call for 
minute and painstaking elaboration on the part 
of experts. A standard such as this cannot, 
however, justly be exacted in the case of a 
work carried on by private enterprise and un- 
der press of the necessity of publishing while 
public interest is alert. If the work could have 
been undertaken with larger resources and 
with more leisure for preparation, it would be 
easy to frame higher requirements ; but, tak-

ing conditions as they are, every student and 
reader of history will be thankful to the edi- 
tors and publishers for having undertaken this 
almost heroic work. 

The ten volumes now published cover the first 
quarter century of actual Spanish occupation. 
Documents connected with the demarcation 
by the Pope of the Spanish and Portuguese 
claims, together with the accounts of earlier 
voyages of discovery, take up the bulk of the 
first two volumes. In the succeeding, there 
are laid before us the accounts of missionaries 
and explorers, the reports of governors, the 
remonstrances and memorials of ecclesiastics, 
and the ordinances and letters of instruction 
emanating from the home government. Among 
the most important and interesting of these 
documents are Legaspi's relation of the con- 
quest ; the accounts of the geographical and 
ethnological features of the Philippine Islands 
by Artieda, Riquel, Laorca, De Sande, and 
De Plasencia; the administrative report of 
De Vera and Desmarinas ; the remonstrances 
of De Rada and De Salazar against the cruel- 
ties and abuses of the Spanish conquest ; the 
general petition of 1586 ; and the royal in- 
structions to Governor Tello. The picture pre- 
sented in these volumes contains in miniature 
almost all the features of later Philippine de- 
velopment, and it even affords us a glimpse of 
the impending conflict between Eastern and 
Western nations which has even now not ap- 
proached its final settlement. The soldiers of 
the conquest have little regard for the rights 
of the natives ; their cruelties impress them- 
selves upon the minds of the latter so forcibly 
that they hesitate to accept the joys of the 
Christian heaven, " where there may be some 
Spanish soldiers." The leading missionaries 
and ecclesiastics, from the very first, take up 
the position of protectors of the natives ; De 
Rada protests against the methods of conquest 
and Bishop De Salazar is bitter in his com- 
plaints about the tyranny of Spanish officials. 
The missionaries consider the Philippine col- 
ony as their province, and the mediaeval battle 
between ecclesiastical and secular jurisdiction 
is fought over again on a lesser scale but with 
no abatement of bitterness. The natives of the 
Philippines, whose customs and general civ- 
ilization are in these " relations " usually de- 
scribed from the point of view of the man who 
has come to redeem them from sinfulness, in 
large numbers accept the new faith and place 
themselves under the guidance of the mission- 
aries. The commercial relations of the islands

are at the earliest date made the subject of re- 
strictive regulations in order to obtain for the 
Spanish conquerors the easy profits of a monop- 
oly of trade. During the first decades of the 
Spanish occupation numerous Chinese come to 
live in Manila, the newly founded capital ; they 
form a community of their own, but many among 
them are inclined to an at least temporary ac- 
ceptance of Christianity. The encomienda 
system of New Spain is transferred to the Phil- 
ippines, and the principal question in political 
discussions is the tribute paid by the natives 
and the tithes demanded of the encomenderos. 

As far as it is possible to form a judgment 
on the basis of the documents presented in 
these early volumes, it seems apparent that the 
conquest was not so cruel and was also far less 
difficult than that of Spanish-America. The 
documents also show that the missionaries fully 
realized the possibilities before them, that they 
were filled with a generous enthusiasm engen- 
dered by great opportunities and with a feeling 
of responsibility for the welfare of the natives. 
The royal instructions to Governor Tello, of 
the year 1696, form a most instructive docu- 
ment. They enjoined upon the governor the 
fostering of religious work, the construction of 
a dignified cathedral, and respect for ecclesias- 
tical jurisdiction ; the administrative recom- 
mendations deal chiefly with the collection of 
tribute and with the monopoly of trade. 

But no matter how favorable our judgment 
may be concerning the motives of the leading 
men in these earlier years and concerning the 
fruits of their efforts, it can hardly be as un- 
qualified as that pronounced by the editors in 
their introduction and the prefaces. It is to 
be regretted that they should have seen fit to 
accept the view of one of the parties in the in- 
terminable controversy in Philippine history, 
and to have anticipated a judgment that can 
be founded only upon a very careful examina- 
tion of all the documentary material. Indeed, 
it may be questioned whether this controversy 
can ever be settled satisfactorily at all. The 
witnesses whose testimony we have were mostly 
themselves in the thick of the struggle, and 
their accounts are full of unconscious prejudice. 
Impartial governmental material as well as ac- 
counts of unbiased observers are very scarce, 
and the recorded forms of laws and institutions 
are very often misleading, as they did not al- 
ways correspond to the real facts of the public 
administration. It will therefore undoubtedly 
be necessary to suspend judgment for some 
time to come. The more surprising must be 



the superlative and unqualified statements 
made in the historical introduction. The state- 
ments that Legaspi has no rival as a colonial 
pioneer ; that " the work of the conversion and 
civilization of the Philippines must be pro- 
nounced as an achievement without a parallel 
in history "; that the existence of the Filipinos 
under Spanish rule was " on as high a plane 
as has yet been obtained by any people of color 
anywhere in the world, or by any Orientals for 
any such length of time"; and, finally, that 
" the position of women was fully as good 
among the Christian Indians as among the 
Christian peoples of Europe "; indicate that 
the writer of the introduction has been charmed 
by the highly favorable accounts of Morga and 
Zuniga. Even the documents already pre- 
sented in this collection would necessitate the 
revision of such sweeping generalizations. In 
the earlier prefaces the editors have assumed 
the position that the Philippine clergy were the 
humanitarian protectors of the natives, who 
were ruthlessly exploited by the secular offi- 
cials and other Spaniards. The editors fur- 
ther cite without dissent the views of Crawfurd 
and of others, according to whom the natives 
at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards were 
practically " naked savages." As to the real 
condition of the natives, the relations of Loarca, 
Artieda, and Plasencia, who looked upon them 
with by no means favorable eyes, show that a 
relatively high degree of civilization had been 
achieved by the Filipino tribes before the 
coming of the Spaniards. The natives had de- 
veloped mining and a diversified agricultural 
industry, they manufactured cotton cloth and 
silk, they were familiar with the processes of 
assaying, and their cast bronze excited the ad- 
miration of the conquerors ; they had regular 
trade relations with China and Borneo ; and 
though living in great simplicity, their society 
was differentiated and their laws bear witness 
to a social development far above that of the 
savage. In the Tagal language the natives 
had an instrument of expression highly de- 
veloped in grammatical structure and rich in 
literary possibilities. 

The slavery existing among the natives was 
abolished by the Spaniards, who, however, sub- 
stituted a new system of serfdom in the form 
of the encomiendas. Though the principal 
missionaries fought bravely and conscientiously 
against the exploitation of the natives, the dis- 
regard of their rights was by no means always 
confined to the secular part of the population. 
In an interesting public document of 1592, the

friars pronounced for the enslavement of cap- 
tives of war, and we find it repeatedly stated 
by high officials that ecclesiastics were practi- 
cally enslaving natives for their own benefit. 
Though slavery was formally abolished, the 
original social distinctions among the natives 
were maintained, and the serfs, or Calians, con- 
tinued for centuries to be heavily oppressed by 
the classes above them, especially by the Ban- 
ians, from among whom the local officials — 
the gobernadorcillas and cabezas — were se- 
lected. In addition to the taxes for the church 
and state, heavy dues were exacted from the 
lower classes by these quasi-feudal superiors. 
In any estimate of the friars' achievements 
in the Philippine Islands full credit will of 
course be given the orders for the brave and 
generous enthusiasm with which their work 
was originally undertaken ; the rapid establish- 
ment of Spanish rule and of the forms of 
Christianity certainly testify to the ability and 
devotion of the early missionaries. But Philip- 
pine history must be judged as a whole, and it 
would certainly be premature to conclude that 
in the protracted struggle between the clergy 
and the secular powers the former were always 
in the right. The natives were vouchsafed the 
care and training due to children, but the 
friars resisted any change that would have led 
their proteges onward to an independent man- 
hood. In this respect the history of Paraguay 
has much in common with that of the Philip- 
pines. In the case of both there existed a be- 
nevolent guardianship of dependent popula- 
tions. When the protecting hand of the Jes- 
uits was withdrawn in Paraguay, the natives 
proved unable to maintain themselves under 
the changed conditions. In the Philippine 
Islands the guardianship thus exercised came 
finally to be resented most bitterly by the wards 
themselves. No matter how idyllic may be the 
picture of a life protected from the storms of 
existence and preserving the simplicity of 
childhood, it is not an ideal that can perma- 
nently satisfy a race of any vigor or ability. 

The editors in their prefaces give a succinct 
synopsis of the documents contained in each 
volume. There might have been a little more 
articulation of the meaning of the material, 
more differentiation of what is deeply impor- 
tant from what is merely the interesting gos- 
sip of travellers. On the side of legislation 
and institutions the collection is so far some- 
what weak ; thus, while we would of course not 
look for a reprint of the Hecopilaciones, the 
legislation in protection of the natives might 



well be given in some detail. The critical and 
explanatory notes are so few as to be of slight 
value, and they give but little assistance in 
judging of the relative importance and of the 
historical position of the individual documents. 
But notwithstanding all such minor criticisms 
and reservations, the great utility of the work 
is unquestioned, and the devotion of the edi- 
tors and publishers to their monumental task 
will undoubtedly make the work increasingly 
satisfactory in all respects, and increasingly 
just to all the historical factors involved.

On the Roof of the World.* 

Eastern Turkestan, Mongolia, and Tibet are 
practically unknown regions. Their almost 
limitless sand-wastes, their rugged and lofty 
mountains, their high elevation, and their large 
areas either sparsely occupied or with no in- 
habitants at all, are serious natural barriers to 
the work of the explorer and geographer. With- 
in the last quarter-century, several explorers 
have boldly faced the difficulties and passed 
through portions of this terra incognita. Among 
these we find the names of Projevalsky, a 
Russian, Rockhill, an American, Landor, an 
Englishman, and now Hedin, a Swede. 

Dr. Hedin made a trip across Asia, which 
terminated disastrously for his whole expedi- 
tion, in the sand-wastes of Eastern Turkestan, 
in 1896. He has vividly described this cam- 
paign in his " Through Asia," and has there 
set forth some of his geographical discoveries 
and determinations. The results of that expedi- 
tion won for the explorer distinguished recog- 
nition from the Royal Geographical Society of 
Great Britain, and other scientific societies, 
and by several of the crowned heads of Europe. 
Thereby his purpose to penetrate not only 
Eastern Turkestan, but " the forbidden land," 
Tibet, received royal encouragement and im- 
perial support ; for the Czar of Russia tran- 
sported him and his entire outfit free of cost 
to the eastern terminus of the Russian railway, 
and put at his disposal four Cossacks. 

The first purpose of his campaign was to 
determine the geography of Eastern Turkestan. 
This geographical division is an irregular oval 
in shape, stretching east and west, about 1600 
miles in len gth, almost surrounded by high

mountains. Its rivers, draining the mountains 
on every side, all flow into a basin, without out- 
let, in the eastern end of the country, touching 
the desert of Gobi. Except at the foot of the 
mountains and on the banks of the streams, 
the country is a barren sand-waste, the most 
dreadful portion of it being the Takla-Makan 
south of the Tarim, in which Dr. Hedin lost 
his entire caravan in 1896. 

He set out with a caravan from Kashgar in 
September, 1899, and sent it east on the car- 
avan route to Lop-nor, while he, with a body of 
servants, embarked on a river-craft or house- 
boat at Lailik and floated down the Tarim river 
for two and a half months, or until winter froze 
up the stream. During all this time, Hedin 
carefully measured and mapped this great river 
in all its sinuosities, through a winding dis- 
tance of over 1500 miles. Having established 
a camp, he made two campaigns in different 
directions to ascertain the geographical features 
of the Lop-nor country, or the basin of Eastern 
Turkestan. In the spring of 1900 he com- 
pleted his measurements of the Tarim to its 
terminus in the great central basin. In the 
autumn of 1900 he crossed the Altyn Tagh 
with a caravan and penetrated southward into 
northern Tibet, a distance in a straight line of 
600 miles. The region averages an altitude 
of about 15,000 feet, is very mountainous, is 
wholly uninhabited except by wild animals, and 
abounds in surprising geographical peculiar- 
ities. This journey occupied four months. 
From December, 1900, to March, 1901, he 
made a tour of the eastern reach of the Altyn 
Tagh, crossed the desert of Gobi to the north, 
and swung around once more into the Lop-nor 
basin. By a strange chance, one of his serv- 
ants had found the ruins of a house in the for- 
mer crossing of the desert. This time Hedin 
and his whole company set to work and discov- 
ered innumerable remains of houses, temples, 
mounds, carvings, coins, an image of Buddha, 
and several hundred Chinese manuscripts. By 
making a careful survey of the region, he 
decided that these remains marked the site of 
an ancient city, whose prosperity, with the 
fertility of its surroundings, were dependent 
on their proximity to an ancient basin, — the 
terminus of all of the rivers of Eastern 
Turkestan. With time and the shifting of 
the sands, the present basin is now fifty miles 
toward the southwest. The manuscripts and 
coins found in the ruins belong to a period 
between the second and fifth centuries A. D. 

In June, 1901, Dr. Hedin started south over 



the mountains into Tibet with a caravan of 
thirty-nine camels, forty-five horses and mules, 
and eighteen men, and provisions for ten 
months, with the ultimate purpose of reaching 
the Holy City of Lassa. The first 600 miles 
led over snow-covered mountains rising as high 
as 18,250 feet above the sea, across miry val- 
leys, through narrow and steep passes, and over 
swift rivers, with not a denizen aside from wild 
asses, yaks, bears, wolves, and marmots. Hav- 
ing pitched his camp, he started with a lama, 
whom he had picked up in the Lop country, 
and who had lived a year in Lassa, and a 
Buriat Cossack. Attired as Mongol lamas, 
these three set out to make a dash to Lassa. 
But their fame had preceded them from the 
Lop country, and spies found them when 
within eighty miles of Lassa. The Kamba 
Bombo (governor) of Nakkchu met them with 
his cavalry and peremptorily ordered them 
back ; and back they had to go to their main 
encampment. 

Thus defeated in one of the cherished pur- 
poses of his great campaign. Dr. Hedin with 
his caravan investigated the lakes of Selling- 
tso, Chargut-tso, and Addan-tso, and thence 
struck out across Tibet toward Ladak in North- 
ern India. The Tibetans, according to their 
custom, were careful to see that they were fur- 
nished with transport animals and food, and 
also that they should not turn their course 
toward Lassa. In four months this caravan 
crossed the remaining steppes of Tibet, attain- 
ing at times an altitude of 18,000 feet. On 
Christmas day, 1901, the nine remaining cam- 
els of that great caravan entered the city of 
Leh in British India. 

The volumes recounting these exploits are 
entitled " Central Asia and Tibet." They com- 
prise a diary of daily events for a period of two 
and a half years. At times there is monotony 
in the narrative. But the daring adventures 
of the explorer, the newness of the scenes, the 
keenness of his observations, and the mathe- 
matical accuracy of his methods, by the use of 
the latest instruments, gratify the most exact- 
ing of readers. The volumes are embellished 
with 420 illustrations made from photographs 
and drawings by the author. Five maps indi- 
cate by red lines the various routes of the 
author throughout his long campaigns. These 
maps contain many new fixed points, as com- 
pared with those of East Turkestan and Tibet in 
common use. Such daring geographical service 
as this will soon solve the mysteries of Central 
Asia and Tibet. Ira M. Price.

Criticisms of Dartvin.* 

Everyone is familiar with the fact, that 
when in bisexual animals the male and the 
female cells unite to form a new individual, 
that individual is either male or female, not 
intermediate between the two. Very rarely 
the characters of the sexes are united in such a 
manner that one part of the animal is like the 
male, the other like the female ; thus in butter- 
flies having the wings of a diflferent color in the 
two sexes, specimens have been found in which 
one side had the male color (say blue), the 
other the female (say brown). Such creatures 
are called gynandromorphs (a Greek descrip- 
tive term) and are considered very wonderful. 
Even these do not show real blending ; the sev- 
eral parts have male or female characters, 
though combined in one individual. 

Why should it be thus? Obviously, were it 
not so, the separation of the sexes could never 
have occurred. This, however, is a reason, not 
an explanation. The fact appears to be, that 
the opposing characters represented by the 
sexes are incompatible ; like two birds hatched 
in a nest which is only large enough for one, 
— one has to get out. It is even believed by 
many, with good reason, that the circumstances 
which determine sex in a given individual may 
be more or less controlled. Sexual dimorphism 
is so common that we take it for granted, but 
we do not always realize that many other kinds 
of dimorphism and polymorphism occur among 
animals and plants. Thus cats are prevalently 
of three or four well-known colors, intermedi- 
ates being comparatively rare. Ants have 
males, females, and workers, and the latter are 
frequently of more than one type. Without 
going into further detail, it may be said that 
there are many characters besides the sexual 
ones, which when contributed by heredity sep- 
arate out, and are not commonly inherited in 
mixed form by the individual. 

Frequently certain characters are inherited 
together ; thus men have beards, and certain 
kinds of complexion indicate probable suscep- 
tibility to particular diseases. On the other 
hand, we may have " mosaic inheritance," — 
that is, mixed like a mosaic pattern, the single 
characters being pure, but variously combined 
in different individuals. This sort of inheri- 
tance results in what are sometimes called 

* Evolution and Adaptation. By Thomas Hunt 
Morgan. New York : The Macmillan Co. 

Doubts about Darwinism. By a Semi-Darwinian. 
New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



" kaleidoscopic variations," and when the char- 
acters concerned are numerous, the possible 
results are very many, like the patterns of a 
kaleidoscope, all made by the same bits of glass. 

While characters thus exclude one another, 
every offspring of two parents must get some- 
thing from each, otherwise the functions of sex 
are stultified. When the whole of the charac- 
ters of the parents are so incongruous that they 
cannot compromise, there is no offspring ; and 
this, I believe, is the simple explanation of the 
sterility of crosses. Strasburger has shown 
that in plants quite impossible hybrids may 
reach a certain stage of growth, coming to dis- 
aster long before a seed is formed. Similarly, 
there is a limit to the development of any par- 
ticular character in a species. When it reaches 
a certain point, it is like a man who will no 
longer obey the laws of his country, — he or the 
country has to yield, and it is easy to see which. 

In recent years, a great deal of attention has 
been directed to these different forms of inheri- 
tance and great stress has been laid upon the 
fact that certain characters, or sets of charac- 
ters, may appear all at once, by a sudden shift- 
ing of the specific equilibrium, as it were. The 
suddenly appearing forms, thus newly endowed, 
are called ^' mutations," and it is found that 
they very generally breed true. The same sort 
of mutation may appear over and over again. 
Just how these " mutations " are related to the 
past history of the race, it is impossible to say ; 
some think that they are the results of new 
combinations of existing and latent characters, 
others that they are genuine novelties, as all 
species were once thought to be by a process of 
special creation. Historical evidence is offered 
in favor of the latter view in some cases ; thus 
the Hereford cattle all have white faces, though 
we know that it was not so very long ago when 
this conspicuous mark was wanting. We do 
not know that the white face was derived from 
anywhere in particular ; it seems to have come 
as we find it, and ever since remained. In the 
case of the Spitz dog, it is evident that no wild 
ancestor could have had such characters, and 
survived ; yet in none of these cases have we 
anything like complete historical records. The 
particular cases I cite — because they are 
familiar — have not I think received a thorough 
study in the light of the newer doctrines, but 
for purposes of illustration they are sufficient. 

The purport of all the above is to make it 
clear what has engaged the attention of latter- 
day evolutionists ; and it must now be said, 
that there has arisen a group of men who be-

lieve that to all intents and purposes "muta- 
tions" are new species. That is to say, that 
new species — plants or animals having tan- 
gible distinctive characters, which are inherited 
— come into being all at once, without the aid 
of the Darwinian factor of " natural selection." 

Dr. Morgan's book on " Evolution and 
Adaptation " is written in support and defense 
of the doctrine just mentioned. He admits 
that natural selection has destroyed innumer- 
able "new species " on the very threshold of 
their existence, but holds that on the other 
hand many have survived simply because their 
characters, even though slightly harmful, were 
not sufficiently so to cause their elimination. 
He admits the obvious fact that creatures are 
adapted to their surroundings, but urges as an 
argument against this being the result of nat- 
ural selection, that the " adaptation " is fre- 
quently more perfect than the nature of the 
case demands. 

The discussion of the " mutation theory," 
and especially the breeding experiments of such 
men as de Vries of Holland and Bateson of 
England, are certainly bringing out many in- 
teresting facts, and whatever is the ultimate 
effect upon biological theory, the air will have 
been cleared of various misconceptions. In this 
discussion, however, caution and scientific 
method are necessary, and I must say that Dr. 
Morgan does not seem to me to possess either. 
His book is written after the manner of a law- 
yer, whose only interest is to clear his client, 
and discredit the witnesses for the other side. 
Of most of the matters treated, he has appa- 
rently no first-hand knowledge, and his famili- 
arity with the details of zoology may be judged 
when we find him supposing (p. 181) that all 
Hymenoptera are bees. His commonest and 
most insistent argument is that we cannot sup- 
pose this or that to have any utility, we cannot 
believe in such and such hypotheses necessary 
according to the Darwinian theory, and conse- 
quently it is impossible that natural selection 
can have produced the results attributed to it. 
The practised zoologist or botanist will dis- 
count these statements as merely exhibiting 
want of knowledge or lack of imagination, for 
he is very well aware that it is in many cases 
impossible or very difficult to explain the mean- 
ing of characters without seeing them in actual 
use. If it were possible to resurrect some of 
the learned men of ancient Greece and show 
them some of our complicated modern machin- 
ery, not in action, would they not declare that 



its use was inconceivable, and that as art it was 
inferior to that of their own day ? Just so does 
our book-learned naturalist dogmatise about 
the inutility of specific characters, while he 
who goes out among living things is amazed at 
the wonderful relations between structure and 
environment. That all characters which mark 
species have utility, or have had utility, or are 
correlated with those which have or had utility, 
we are not able to prove, and in the nature of 
things never can prove directly, by taking each 
of the millions of cases separately. Conse- 
quently it is easy enough for anyone to produce 
numerous unexplained instances, but we are 
reminded of Huxley's reply to the spiritualist, 
— "if I cannot offer an explanation, it does 
not follow that I am bound to accept yours," — 
or words to that effect. 

The worst feature in Dr. Morgan's book, I 
think, is the way in which he parades all sorts 
of evolutionary doctrines, one after another, 
and proceeds to demolish them without making 
it at all clear that many of them are already 
obsolete. It is ridiculous to treat Darwin's 
writings as if they were a body of dogma like 
that of the theologians, to be accepted as it 
stands or not at all. Darwin changed his 
opinions as he got new light, and if he were 
living to-day he would certainly have reached 
some new conclusions, which the facts known 
in his day did not permit. In the strongest 
possible contrast with Darwin's rjeally scientific 
and enquiring attitude is Dr. Morgan's delib- 
erate attempt (as it seems to me) to discredit 
the Darwinian theory by attacking doctrines 
abandoned by modern Darwinians, and insid- 
iously suggesting that the others are no better. 
There has been a superabundance of such argu- 
ment in the field of theology, but we hardly 
expect it from a scientific man. I should like 
to quote a number of passages, to show the bias 
of some and the absurdity of others, but this 
review is already too long. 

The anonymous " Doubts about Darwinism" 
is quite a different sort of book. It has this 
in common with Dr. Morgan's work, that it is a 
re-thrashing of old straw, but it treats of those 
philosophical difficulties which occur to every 
thinking person, and are part of the paradox 
of sentient existence. The writer concludes 
that the phenomena of nature, and particularly 
those of evolution, cannot be wholly explained 
on Darwinian grounds, but must have required 
the intervention of intelligence.

Recent American Poetry.* 



Of the American poets now living, Mr. George 
Edward Woodberry is probably the most distin- 
guished. "We think of but one other, Mr. William 
Vaughn Moody, who might fairly dispute the claim 
for this primacy, and if quality alone were to be 
taken into account, we should be inclined to award 
the palm to the author of " The Masque of Judg- 
ment " and " An Ode in Time of Hesitation." 
Certainly, judged by the test of their ethical envis- 
agement of the late happenings which so deeply 
concern our national honor and the sanctity of our 
holiest patriotic ideals, a surer sense of what is 
eternally righteous is revealed in the work of the 
younger poet. He it is who has solemnly declared : 

" For save we let the island men g^o free. 
Those baffled and dislaarelled ghosts 
Will curse ns from the lamentable coasts 
Where walk the frustrate dead. 
The cup of trembling shall be drained quite. 
Eaten the sour bread of astonishment. 
With ashes of the hearth shall be made white 
Our hair, and wailing shall be in the tent." 

Compared with these impressive words, Mr. Wood- 
berry's utterance upon the same theme seems no 
more than so much facile and empty rhetoric. 

" Rejoice, O mighty Mother, that God hath chosen Thee 
To be the western warder of the Islands of the Sea ; 
He lifteth up, He casteth down, He is the King of Kings, 
Whose dread commands o'er awe-struck lands are borne 
on eagles' wings." 

Mr. Woodberry strikes a far finer note in his son- 
nets " At Gibraltar," when he writes :

" Law, justice, liberty — great gifts are these ; 
Watch that they spread where English blood is spilt, 
Lest, mixed and sullied with his country's guilt. 
The soldier's life-stream flow, and Heaven displease! " 

It is a pity that he should have failed in the ob- 
vious application of this great truth to present-day 
conditions, and joined himself to the laudatores 
temporis acti in the matter of our national rake's 
progress in buccaneering. The lines to <' My 
Country," 

" Who never through deceit thy ends hast sought. 
Nor toiling millions for ambition tasked, 

For thou art founded in the eternal fact 
That every man doth greaten with the act 
Of freedom."— 

These lines sound strangely ironical in the light of 
recent history. But the quality of Mr. Woodberry's 
work as a whole is suiOBciently high to condone in 
some measure this particular obliquity of vision, 
and the quantity is now so considerable that it 
must come into the reckoning. How considerable 
that quantity is may now be seen without difficulty, 
for the author has collected into a single volume 
all of the poetical work which he has thought worth 
preserving, and there are almost three hundred 
pages of it altogether. It covers nearly twenty- 
five years of scattered production, for the poet of 
whom we have thought as belonging to the younger 
generation is now close upon the completion of his 
half-century. The date of composition of " The 
North Shore Watch " we do not know, but the 
friend whom it melodiously commemorates died in 
1878, which is a full quarter-century ago. From 
this beautiful poem, which barely misses a place 
among the world's great threnodies, to the stately 
Emerson ode written for last year's centenary, the 
volume of Mr. Woodberry's " Poems " range from 
the wilding lyrical cry of " Wild Eden " to the 
grave philosophical beauty of the " Agathon," and 
the austere dignity of the sonnets on Columbus and 
Gibraltar, and <' America and England in Danger 
of War." Within this range are many noble spaces 
consecrated to the glory of nature and of art, or 
dedicated to worthy persons and institutions. The 
poet who alternately takes Shelley and Wordsworth 
for his exemplars cannot go far astray, and an oc- 
casional too evident imitation need not seriously 
lessen our thankfulness for his gifts. He speaks of 
his life : as " never so fortunate as to permit more 
than momentary and incidental cultivation of that 
art which is the chief grace of the intellectual life," 
but the apologetic note seems hardly called for in 
view of the totality of his achievement as here col- 
lected within a single pair of covers. 

" Songs of the Sea Children " is the title of the 
third volume in Mr. Bliss Carman's lyrical series. 
The wood children, or the meadow children, or the 
sky children would have done just as well for a 
name, since musical sound and suggestive imagery 
seem to be the author's cardinal aims in his later 
verse, without much regard for the meaning. Here 
are upwards of a hundred songs, averaging a dozen

lines each, no one of them leaving a clean-cut 
memory, yet all gracefal, and surrounding the 
reader with a pleasant haze of fancy tinged with 
emotion. 

" Far hence in the infinite silence 
How we shall learn and f org^et, 
Know and be known, and remember 
Onl}- the name of regret ? 

" Sown in that ample qniet, 
We shall break sheath and climb, 
Seeds of a single desire 
In the heart of the apple of time. 

" We shall grow wise as the flowers, 
And know what the bluebirds sing. 
When the hands of the grasses unravel 
The wind in the hollows of spring. 

"And out of the breathless summer 
The aspen leaves will stir, 
' At your low sweet laugh to remember 

The imperfect things we were." 

This is a fair example of Mr. Carman's languorous 
and delicately sensuous song. We will make one 
other quotation, mainly for the purpose of showing 
his happy use of the old Arahic star- names, some 
of which are poems in themselves. 

" In Qod's blue garden the flowers are cold, 
As yon tell them over star by star, 
Sirius, Algol, pale Altair, 
Lone Arcturus, and Algebar. 

"In love's red garden the flowers are warm. 
As I count them over and kiss them by. 
From the sultry royal rose-red mouth 
To the last carnation dusk and shy." 

Mr. Lloyd Mi£B.in's latest collection of sonnets is 
styled " Castalian Days," which suggests the fact 
that a considerable number of them are upon clas- 
sical themes. Others are sonnets for pictures, and 
personal or memorial tributes. Our selection shall 
be the sonnet "To the New Century," which be- 
longs to neither of the above classes, and embodies 
an ethical rather than an aesthetic inspiration. 

" The accursed rage for wealth, devoid of ruth. 
Fumes in the breast of peoples and of kings : 
Is this the guerdon that the Century brings — 
Insatiate avarice with relentless tooth ? 

" Where is the promise of the Nation's youth, — 
The dreams icarian — the auroral wings ? 
That earlier quest of immaterial things, — 
High principle, religion, honor, truth ? 

" What shall relume our spiritual night 
While brazen Progress, cloaking banal greed. 
Crushes the soul 'neath her Mammonian car ? 

" What dayspring rises for the Spirit's need ? — 
What of the Soul's inviolable star ? 
Torch of the Years 1 is this thy vaunted Light? " 

We appreciate the fine impulse of these lines, and 
yet they share with Mr. Mifflin's other sonnets in 
the lack of spontaneity. Coldly correct is the epi- 
thet which best describes the work of this thought- 
ful and accomplished writer. 

Another volume also made up entirely of son- 
nets is the work of Mr. Joseph Warren Beach. It 
is entitled " Sonnets of the Head and Heart," and 
its contents are pleasing as to form and sentiment 
alike. Mr. Beach's impulses somehow seem less 



premeditated than those of Mr. Mifflin, and the re- 
sult is consequently more appealing. One example 
is called " Proteus." 

" Knowest thou yet my voice ? Or hast thou heard 
In vain the murmurs of thy paradise ? 
When to the horn's melodious enterprise 
The low voice of the violin demurred. 
Was it not still the glad cry of the bird ? 
And when you felt your love's bewitching eyes 
Upon you, did you entertain surprise 
That in your own heart the same longing stirred ? 

" I am a god protean, for my name 

Is named diversely. I am called the Word 
Because I made the world. As Love I fill 
The veins of all the universe with fl^me. 
And because my desire, though long deferred. 
Is ever won at last, men call me Will." 

Even and careful workmanship, with not a little 
of genuine poetical feeling, is characteristic of Mr. 
Beach's volume throughout. 

The foreword of Mr. Yield's " Random Verse " 
has a lilt that makes us anticipate a volume of 
Swinburnian echoes. 

" But the Spirit of Song, overladen 
With burdens of mutable years. 
Still as young as the tear of a maiden, 

Still as old as the tribute of tears ; 
Though her footsteps grown feeble may falter, 

Though her tombs and her temples be sealed. 
She shall bear them as gifts to an altar, 
Her fruits of the flock and the field." 

Such echoes we find occasionally in the pages that 
follow, but in the main the poet speaks to us with 
an individual accent. He is an adept at easy and 
swinging rhythms ; he has fancy of a high quality, 
and the touch of distinction. Our expository pur- 
pose is best served by quoting the poem "Stop, 
Thief ! " 

" Love sat down like a tired tinker. 
Asking only a shady seat. 
Feaster neither he nor drinker, 
Wine nor bread would he sip nor eat. 

" Love slept well in the April weather — 

Laid him low where the sweet-fern grows ; 
Gold of gorse and the purple heather. 
Pink of poppy and rose of rose. 

" Love stole off in the misty dawning. 

Casting never a look behind ; 

Calling never a gay good morning. 

Went his way where its white ways wind. 

" Ye who watch for the mad marauder. 
Faring far with his gains ill got. 
Stay Love's steps ere he cross the border, — 
Love has stolen — I knew not what." 

Mr. Yield's thought is not always clear, being ad- 
dicted to symbolism, but it is of such a quality that 
this slight volume outweighs many a tome of the 
more labored and pretentious sort of verse. 

Mr. James Lincoln introduces his " Relishes 
of Rhyme " with a note that ends as follows : " It 
will be evident to the reader, if so excellent a per- 
sonage exists, that they were suggested, in most 
instances, by cablegrams from South Africa as 
given to the American press during the Boer war." 
Most of these pieces are trifles of a careless sort — 
newspaper verses and nothing more. But to thi

statement we mast make exception in favor of some 
half-dozen of the poems, and particularly in favor 
of the fine sonnets to England which open and close 
the volume. We quote the first of these sonnets. 
" Who would trust England, let him lift his eyes 
To Nelson, columned o'er Trafalgar Square, 
Her hieroglyph of duty, written where 
The roar of traffic hushes to the skies ; 
Or mark, while Paul's vast shadow softly lies 
On Gordon's statued sleep, how praise and prayer 
Flush through the frank young faces clustering there 
To con that kindred rune of sacbificb. 

" O England, no hland cloud-ship in the blue. 
But rough oak plunging on o'er perilous jars 

Of reef and ice, our faith will follow you 

The more for tempest roar that strains your spars 

And splits your canvas, be your helm but true. 
Your courses shapen by the eternal stars." 

In the pieces that follow, Mr. Lincoln reveals him- 
self as a Boer partisan, although not of the rabid 
type, and takes quite for granted that in defend- 
ing her invaded territory and taking measures 
to prevent similar future invasions, England was 
betraying the cause of freedom. This seems to us 
a topsy-turvy way of viewing the situation, although 
we are well aware that it is the view of many men 
whom we hold in the highest respect. 

The " Ballads of Valor and Victory " that have 
been written by Messrs. Clinton Scollard and 
Wallace Rice with carefully-conceived intent to 
illustrate the most significant phases of American 
heroism, make up a volume that stirs the blood and 
deepens the patriotism. Each of the authors has 
contributed twenty-five pieces, and the series as a 
whole, chronologically ordered, presents in spirited 
verse the story of such deeds of daring as may well 
awaken the pride of all who are the countrymen of 
those who figure in these ballads. The variety of 
the volume is so great, both in theme and in met- 
rical effect, that adequate illustration is impossible ; 
each piece illustrates itself, and hardly any other. 
From Mr. Scollard's share in the work we may 
select this strophe from "The Men of the Maine": 
" Not in the dire, ensanguined front of war. 
Conquered or conqueror, 
'Mid the dread battle-peal, did they go down 
To the still nnder-seas, with fair Renown 
To weave for them the hero-martyr's crown. 
They struck no blow 
'Gainst an embattled foe ; 
With valiant-hearted Saxon hardihood 
They stood not as the Essex sailors stood. 
So sore bestead in that far Chilian bay ; 
Yet no less faithful they, 
These men who, in the passing of a breath, 
Were hurtled upon death." 

The work of Mr. Rice we may best illustrate by 
the first two stanzas of " Richard Hakluyt's Men." 
" Here sighs the breath of the sea. 

And here sounds the boom of the wave. 
The crash of the surf on the beach. 
Through time everlastingly ; 

And here, through the elements' reach. 
The lightning, the storm, and the spume, 
Comes the cry of the sailors who gave 
Their bones to the surges to bleach, 
Their souls to a billowy doom. 



" What of grey dangers afar 
In spaces uncharted, nntrod ? 
What though the heav'ns are a-change. 
And engulphed is the Cynosure-star? 

What though the sun has grown strange. 
And the deep has been made molten brass ? 
At their peak flies the Cross of their GoD 
And, wherever their rudders may range, 
'Tis His Voice in the tempests that pass." 

As far as the two poets have distinctive manners, 
it may be said that the one is apt to sacrifice grace 
to an overplus of energy, while the other, by dint 
of being less energetic, achieves a more polished 
diction. But the two make admirable yoke-fellows, 
and their joint production is a highly creditable ad- 
dition to a department of American literature that 
seems heretofore to have missed its opportunities. 
What we particularly like about the book is that, in 
spite of its exultant note, it is by no means given 
over to anything like rampant jingoism. Readers 
of many sorts will find satisfaction in its pages, and 
generations of schoolboys, looking for " pieces to 
speak," will arise to call its authors blessed. 

Ralph Erwin Gibbs was a product of the Cali- 
fornia schools and a teacher in the State University. 
A shocking accident last year ended his life at the 
age of twenty-seven, and with it a career as a writer 
that was marked by exceptional promise and per- 
formance. He had published a considerable quan- 
tity of verse in fugitive ways, but never a volume. 
That task has now been performed for him by 
Professor Gayley, who has collected the scattered 
pieces and called them " Songs of Content." Some 
of them are of light and juvenile quality, but others 
betoken the serious thinker, and in all of them there 
is evidence of unusual talent. The author seems to 
have given us a sort of brief spiritual autobiography 
in the sonnet called "The Prize," which we quote. 
" A thriftless one there was who ever sought 
To weave a vagrant fancy into song ; 
Baubles he framed in fretted verse ; and long — 
In love for these his small creations — wrought 
Till each, as from its maker's heart, had caught 
A mimic beat. But friends who saw cried. ' Wrong 
To waste thy Day thus I Not with rhythmic throng. 
Of dreams — with deeds are this World's Prizes bought.' 

Yet still this idle Singer in the Sun, — 
Rhyming his chime of words, with moistened eyes. 
Mood-caught in mesh of verses fancy-spun, — 
Would answer nothing save, in wistful wise, 
' We go strange ways to seek one Goal. The Prize 
Is his who smiles content when Life is done.' " 

This sonnet, standing in the forefront of the vol- 
ume, invites to further discovery, and the enterprize 
does not go unrewarded. It would be both pleas- 
ant and profitable to quote at much length from 
this volume — from such poems as " Daybreak in 
the Sierra Nevada," "The Heretic," and "The 
Marchioness of Yvetot," for example — but we 
have not the space. The best work of Mr. Gibbs 
seems to occur in a group of five poems written in 
Omarian rubaiyat, and one of these five gives us 
quatrains versified from Mr. McCarthy's prose 
translation that are not unworthy to be named in 
the same breath with that of FitzGerald.

" When thou and I are blotted from the List, 
A little while no doubt we shall be missed; 

They '11 set up bricka upon thy grave and mine 
To mark that Thou and I did once exist.

Or potent thou as Monarch of Cathay, 

Or Roman Caesar : — comes the End, and none 
Shall know Thv Ashes from the common Clay." 

This matter is all derivative, no doubt, but the 
expression is certainly noteworthy. It seems to us 
that the author had in him the distinct promise 
of becoming something more than a minor poet, 
and his untimely death is a matter for deep regret. 

After a long silence. Miss Harriet Monroe comes 
before the public with a new volume of verse. This 
latest published work, like her earliest, is dramatic 
in form, but with a difference. Instead of the con- 
ventional five-act play, conforming to the traditions 
of the English poetical drama, she now gives us 
five brief sketches, vivid transcripts of modern life 
or reflections of its issues, richer in their suggestion 
than in their actual verbal investiture, and disclos- 
ing momentary vistas of the deep ultimate realities 
of emotion. Miss Monroe has heard the message of 
the moderns — of the great Norwegian most of all 
— and her little plays might almost be described as 
footnotes to the body of doctrine spanned by the 
arch which began with " Love's Comedy " and 
ended with " When We Dead Awake." Certainly, 
her fundamental idea is the same as that of Dr. 
Ibsen — the idea that our lives are so often mis- 
shapen because we blind ourselves to the realities of 
existence, and do service to false gods. A passage 
from " After All " — the dialogue of two lost souls 
in hell — may be quoted in illustration of this thesis. 

" He. At last 

We who have lost may know the game. 

She. Yea, we who missed the fateful cast. 
Faltering when the angel passed. 
May count his footsteps one by one 
Down to our earth, back to his sun. 

He, And we who never spake before 
May utter pallid words. 

She, And we 

Whose wind-drawn senses feel no more, 
May tell the ruinous heart-throbs o'er 
That beat us down this bitter path. 

He. We — pale inheritors of wrath. 

Who might be treading, hand in hand. 
Spaces afoam with wings. 

She, If you, 

That day when God was with us two. 
Had given me the supreme command. 

He, If you had stood less proudly there 
Against the sun, had seemed aware 
Of the desire that did not dare. 

She, I who dared all ! 



He. If the red lips, 

That smiled, had trembled once. If ever 

One quiver of the fingers-tips 

Had proved you woman 

She. If like a man 

You had torn the veil 

He. We blurred God's plan — 

Rust on the shining rim of heaven. " 

In this beautiful passage is struck the keynote of 
the spiritual tragedy which these little verse-dramas 
echo in various colors. One cannot read them with- 
out being deeply moved or without feeling that this 
writer has achieved a finer art than heretofore. 
It is an art having both restraint and distinction, 
daring enough to use plain speech at need, yet re- 
maining essentially poetical in the most prosaic 
surroundings. 

" The Singing Leaves," by Miss Josephine 
Preston Peabody, is a little book of little songs, 
mostly occupied with childish dreams and fancies, 
graceful, tender, and altogether alluring. It would 
take a very crabbed person to resist the charm of 
the following couplet " Concerning Love ": 

" I wish she would not ask me if I love the Kitten more than 
her. 
Of course I love her. But I love the Kitten too : and It 
has fur." 

These stanzas "Before Meat" are worth quoting: 

" Hunger of the world, 
When we ask a grace, 
Be remembered here with us. 
By the vacant place. 

"Thirst, with nought to drink. 
Sorrow more than mine. 
May God some day make you laugh. 
With water turned to wine." 

An unsuspected aspect of Miss Peabody'a delicate 
art is revealed in these pieces, which are as genuine 
as they are simple. 

A considerable number of the <' Poems " of Miss 
Josephine Daskam (Mrs. Bacon) are songs of child- 
hood, and the happiest of these is the set of stanzas 
which express the childish notion of " Heaven." 

" She says that when we all have died 
We'll walk in white there (then she cried) 
All free from sorrow, sin, and care — 
But I 'm not sure I 'd like it there. 

" She cannot tell me what we '11 do, 
I could n't sing the whole day through : 
The aogels might not care to play. 
Or else I mightn't like their way. 

" I never loved my Uncle Ned, 
So I can't love him now he 's dead. 
He 'd be the only one 1 know — 
She says it 's wicked to talk so. 

" I' d like to see how God would look, 
I 'd like to see that Judgment Book : 
But pretty soon I 'd want to be 
Where the real people were, you see. 

" When people turn dead n a dream, 
I wake up, and I scream and scream : 
And since they 're all dead there, you know, 
I 'm sure that I should feel just so." 

Miss Daskam's verses have grace and fancy ; they 
reflect the tastes of a student of good literature

THE DIAL, 



[March 16, 



with a talent for semi-conscious assioiilation. At 
their most serioas, as in '' Two Sonnets from the 
Hebrew" and the "Washington "Ode," they are 
toached by a grave beauty. Perhaps the highest 
reach of the volume is found in " The Old Captive," 
a poem of sea-passion, which closes with these finely 
imagined lines : 

" Where the pale light strains down through undreamed 
deeps 
To glimmer o'er the vast unpeopled plains, 
The ancient treasure piles of dead kings' fleets, 
The mighty bones long bleached beneath the Sea, 

*' There where cool corals and still seaweeds twine, 
There on the solemn level ocean floor, 
Till God's great arm shall terribly plough the deep, 
I shall lie long and rest beneath the Sea." 

Yet the question arises whether any young woman 
is well occupied with such imaginings. 

Miss H^loise Soule's " Heartsease and Rue " is 
a thin volume of unpretentious but not unpleasing 
verse, of which " No Tears " oflPers a fair example. 
" Thank God, all ye who weep I 
Ye only know the name of dry despair ; 
My barren waste, my arid desert bare, 

Is watered by no tears that gently creep 

" From underneath the lids, 
Soothing the soul again to ancient calm. 
No crying comes to me for healing balm, — 
Nature her common solace me forbids. 

" Think not I never wept I 
'Tis only that the fountain has run dry ; 
And bare beneath the burning, sultry sky 
The blasted desert of my heart is kept." 

It is rather a pity, for the author is evidently a 
very young woman, as is indicated by the fact that 
a " class poem " is the most considerable piece of 
her collection. 

Miss Mary Ainge De Vere opens her volume of 
verse with " The Wind-Swept Wheat," and allows 
that piece to provide a title for the collection. Her 
work displays careful execution, and illustrates 
many phases of sentiment and fancy. " Once " is 
a copy of verses that may serve to illustrate the 
manner of this writer. 

" Cool salt air and the white waves breaking 
Restless, eager, along the strand — 
An evening sky and a sunset glory. 
Fading over the sea and land. 

" We two sitting alone together. 
Side by side in the waning light, 
Before us the throbbing waste of water. 
Behind us the sand heaps, drifted white. 

" Ships were sailing into the distance 

Down to the land where the sun had gone ; 
The rough fresh wind blew o'er our faces. 
The shadows of night crept slowly on. 

" Is it a dream that I remember? 

Some ghost of a hope that will come no more, 
We two sitting alone together, 

Hand in hand, on the ocean shore ? " 

Nature is the predominant inspiration of " A 
Spray of Cosmos," Miss Bristol's volume of poems. 
And we find nothing more fitting to quote than 
these blank verse lines from the poem addressed to 
" The Pyxidanthera ": 



" Sweet child of April, I have found thy place 
Of deep retirement. Where the low swamp ferns 
Curl upward from their sheathes, and lichens creep 
Upon the fallen branch, and mosses dark 
Deepen and brighten, where the ardent sun 
Doth enter with restrained and chastened beam, 
And the light cadence of the bluebirds' song 
Doth falter in the cedar, — there the Spring, 
In gratitude, hath wrought the sweet surprise 
And marvel of thy unobtrusive bloom." 

When we read these lines, we feel like starting at 
once for the pine-barrens of New Jersey, where the 
pyxidanthera is blooming at the present moment. 

" A Hill Prayer " is a poem by Miss Marian 
Warner Wildman, to which the *' Century " maga- 
zine five years ago awarded its prize offered to col- 
lege undergraduates. Encouraged by this early 
success, the author has persevered in verse-compo- 
sition, and now publishes a volume having the 
above-mentioned prize poem in its forefront. Miss 
Wildman's poems are mostly lyrics of nature as 
spiritualized by the reflective mind. " A Beech- 
Wood in October " is an example of her work at 
its best. 

" Beneath the ancient beeches, cloth of gold 

For Autumn's regal passing has been laid. 

Gold sunbeams pierce the thinning golden shade, 
Where wider glimpses of blue sky unfold. 

" No bird sings here ; and never light wind blows 
To stir the leafy curtains, golden brown. 
But still the ripened leaves drift slowly down, 
And still the carpet softer, thicker grows. 

" Among the beeches Autumn does not die 
In crimson passion or in scarlet pain ; 
Here only peace and golden silence reign, 
June dreams forgotten — Winter fears put by. 

" So would I die, O beeches I When at last 

My days are numbered like your ripened leaves, 
I would not be as one who idly grieves, 
And mourns the glories of the Summer past. 

" In peace and golden silence I would lie, 

Still gazing upward through the thinning gold, 
Until the last leaf fell, and there — behold I 
Beyond the lifeless boughs, God's open sky 1 " 

The quiet excellence of these verses is shared by 
many others of Miss Wildman's pieces, and the 
total effect of her work is pleasing in a high degree. 
We will close this review with a word of tribute 
to a woman of marked poetical sensibility and 
meritorious performance in verse — the late Mary 
M. Adams, wife of the late President of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin. " The Song at Midnight," 
arranged for publication just before her death, in- 
cludes poems new and old, from which we select 
a sonnet called " Evening on Lake Winona," with- 
out knowing positively whether it is one of the 
new poems or not, but recognizing it as a typical 
example of the author's work. 

" The Summer's affluent beauty crowns the night ; 
Flowers and fragrance are on every side ; 
The moon, arising as a joyous bride, 
The water seeks and chastens with love's light; 
While happy souls, enraptured with the sight, 
Find here no human sense its best denied ; 
Entrancing melodies on soft airs glide. 
And hearts responsive hold the vision bright.

" If types we get in this fair world of ours, 
Dim foretaste of the good that is to be, 
Then snrely does the charm this night embowers

The simple sincerity and deep religious feeling of

Briefs on New Books. 



This most recent biography of the 
Whittierata Quaker poet, contributed by Profes- 

sor Greorge Rice Carpenter to the 
" American Men of Letters " series (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.), follows close upon the Life by Mr. 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, in the older series 
of " English Men of Letters." The existence of 
this work, together with the earlier biographies by 
Kennedy, Underwood, and Pickard, does not make 
Professor Carpenter's work superfluous or inoppor- 
tune ; the volume has a peculiar value of its own. 
While not many details of importance have been 
left for this later garnering, it has remained for the 
author to throw a new emphasis upon some phases 
of Whittier's career which place his personality in 
an interesting and somewhat unwonted light. In- 
deed, it would not be unfair to suggest that the 
present portraiture of the poet presents him in the 
character of a man of action as distinctly as a man 
of letters — a man of energetic and passionate ac- 
tivities amid the exciting experiences of his early 
manhood ; for to this feature of Whittier's career, 
as journalist, politician, and reformer, the author 
devotes two hundred out of the three hundred 
pages of the book. The position of the young farm- 
er poet among his contemporaries of the New 
England group is shown to be unique ; he was the 
only member of that group country born and bred, 
the only writer of his day distinctively representing 
rural New England and the simple Puritan type. 
Again, Professor Carpenter has given fresh empha- 
sis to the storm and stress period of Whittier's own 
youth, the intense ambition that led him in his 
twenty 'fifth or twenty-sixth year to contemplate ser- 
iously the desertion of the muse for the allurements 
of a political career. " I would have fame with me 
now — or not at all," he wrote to Mrs. Sigourney 
in 1832 ; " Politics is the only field now open for 
me, and there is something inconsistent in the char- 
acter of a poet and modern politician." Later in 
the same year he writes to a friend, " Of poetry I 
have nearly taken my leave, and a pen is getting to 
be something of a stranger to me. I have been 
compelled again to plunge into the political whirl- 
pool, for I have found that my political reputation 
is more influential than my poetical, etc." The de- 
' velopment of abolition sentiment in New England, 



and the growth of the movement to the climax of 
its influence in national politics, is admirably 
sketched. The eminently judicial position of the 
young Quaker, his fearless attitude toward friend as 
well as foe, and his complete freedom from fanati- 
cism, are clearly shown. Of literary criticism, the 
author has less to offer than the earlier biographers, 
but what is offered is pointed as well as brief. 
Professor Carpenter's own literary style is of nota- 
ble excellence, and adds a distinctive quality to the 
book. 

The Dutch ^^ " '^^® Dutch Founding of New 

founding of York," by Mr. Thomas A. Janvier, 

New York, ^g have a sprightly sketch, none the 

less valuable for its sprightliness, of the origins of 
our greatest city and our greatest commonwealth. 
It is but a sketch, though in external aspect it is a 
portly octavo volume ; thick paper and very wide 
margins give the book its size, while the number of 
words is about equal to that of Burke's Speech on 
Conciliation, and is but a quarter greater than that 
of Macaulay's Essay on Milton. But the subject is 
not a large one, and the treatment is entirely ade- 
quate for the needs of every reader except the 
special student of our national beginnings. The 
book will be useful in correcting the false impres- 
sions created by Irving's skilful and humorous mis- 
representation of the Dutch. Everyone knows that 
when New York was founded the Dutch had just 
passed through a tremendous struggle, in which, 
after defying the greatest power of Europe, they 
had fought off the Spaniards, had won their inde- 
pendence, and during the struggle had constantly 
grown in strength and had gained the mastery of 
the seas. Yet the common notion of the Dutch of 
the early seventeenth century is that of a sleepy, 
tobacco-loving, schnapps-drinking people, instead of 
the <' hard-headed, hard-hitting men " that they 
were. Those early Dutch settlers in America are 
not especially lovable as they are shown to us. 
They were rough, smugglers, law-breakers ; they 
cheated and oppressed the Indians ; <' they had the 
vices of their kind enlarged by the vices of their 
time." But they were keen, alert, sturdy, and full 
of pluck, — by no means the easy-going men of 
Irving's fairy tale. Mr. Janvier follows the story 
through from the small beginnings to the melan- 
choly end, showing failure of the Dutch government 
and the steadily growing pressure of the surround- 
ing English colonies, until the inevitable came and 
the English completed their holding on the Atlantic 
coast. Old Peter Stuyvesant is the only character 
that stands out with any clearness, as he is the only 
one about whom many details are given ; and his 
setting forth is by no means creditable to him, 
though in external matters he showed a good sense 
that was sadly lacking in his management of the 
colony. The author, while making his story vivid 
by the use of very modern English, hardly keeps 
up to the traditional dignity of historical writing. 
For instance, within three pages he uses the fol-

lowing expressions: "Those cheeky Commission* 
ers," '' the sporting offer of the Marylanders to fill 
in the close season for tohacco with a time-killing 
war did not materialize," " until the Dutch were 
squeezed out and done for." In all the externals 
of book-making, the work is one of the most at- 
tractive of recent issues from the Harper press. 

Corresponding in kind to Dr. van 
The Bible Dyke's valuable essay on "The 

in Browning. f . ™, „ ■' , 

Bible m lennyson, we now have 
Mrs. Minnie Gresham Machen's volume entitled 
"The Bible in Browning" (Macmillan). It is 
provided with an able introduction, analytical of 
Browning's use of Scriptural phrases and motives, 
and also suggestive of his religious faith. The 
work is well edited and tabulated, showing not 
alone exhaustive research in textual criticism, but 
also a strong appreciation of the broader scope of 
the poet's allusions. So frequently has Browning 
employed some Biblical phrases that they have be- 
come almost mannerisms in both his letters and his 
verse, — as " pearls before swine," " to live and see 
good days," and the thought of Hezekiah, " I will 
go softly all my years," in which the poet usually 
substitutes " days " for " years." With scholarly 
accuracy, Browning rarely introduces Scriptural 
quotations into his classic poems where the allusions 
would be anachronisms for the characters. As the 
sub-title of this volume declares, it deals especially 
with " The Ring and the Book," wherein the author 
locates more than five hundred Biblical quotations 
of direct and subtle reference, taken from a wide 
range of Old and New Testament authors. Not 
alone are these phrases and analogies traceable 
to the Bible, but the poem abounds in reproduc- 
tion of Biblical ceremonials and customs, until it 
seems, in truth, " almost saturated with the Bible." 
Flaws in Browning's phraseology are cited, while 
the admirable adjustment of Biblical material to 
the diverse characters is well emphasized : " The 
language of God's Word falls like dew from the 
dying lips of Pompilia, and is transmuted into gall 
and bitterness on the sarcastic tongue of Count 
Guido. Illustrations from Holy Writ are pumped 
forth profusely by the ready wit of the hypocritical 
lawyers, and are hurled out by the ' soldier-saint,' 
Caponsacchi, to point his indignant invective. And 
the Pope, — that ' good old man who happens to 
hate darkness and love light,' — with clear insight 
and reverent hand, he brings forth out of this 
treasury of truth, things new and old. Turning 
the search-light of God's Word full upon sophistry 
and ignorance, he leaves no confusion of sin with 
mistake or misfortune, but ' In God's Name ' right 
is right and wrong is wrong." In the introduction, 
covering about one-fourth of the volume, the author 
has formulated the main tenets in Browning's creed, 
based upon his Biblical quotations and motives. 
There are a few limitations noted in this portion 
of the study, both in logic and biographic insight; 
but the general creed is \<ell outlined. 



"Not one but 
all mankind't 
epitome," 



A theme to tax the powers of the 
ablest historian has been chosen by 
Winifred Lady Burghclere in her 
"George Villiers, Second Duke of Buckingham" 
(Dutton), and she has shown a grasp of her subject 
and an impartiality in its treatment by no means 
universal among her sister biographers. Her re- 
searches have not been confined to published sources 
of information, numerous as these are, but consid- 
erable unedited matter has also passed under her 
scrutiny. The result is altogether creditable to her, 
the more so that she has not allowed the Duke's 
fascinations to beguile her into whitewashing the 
darker phases of his character. The only criticism 
we would make is one that savors of praise as well 
as of censure. Certain portions of her work betray, 
by contrast, marks of haste. For example, a fuller 
treatment of the " Rehearsal " episode would have 
pleased her readers. The last seven years, too, of 
the Duke's life are despatched in one short chapter. 
In general, the fulness of detail noticeable in the 
first half of the book seems not exactly matched by 
equal painstaking in the last half — as if the writer 
had tired of her disreputable hero, and his scandal- 
ous amours, as well she might have. We look in 
vain for an adequate account of Buckingham's vast 
estates and his passion for building. His Cliefden 
(now Cliveden) House, of interest if only for its 
subsequent varied fortunes, appears not to be men- 
tioned, although acknowledgment is made to its 
present owner, Mr. Astor, for permission to repro- 
duce a portrait of the " wanton Shrewsbury." The 
house, let it be added, has been at least twice de- 
stroyed by fire and rebuilt. Nine good portraits 
add to the interest of this well-written biography. 

The standard work of Professor L^vy- 
The philosophy ^^^]^i q^ ^^^ Philosophy of Comte, 

published m 1900, is now made ac- 
cessible to English readers in a very good transla- 
tion (Putnam). The book is an admirable example 
of clear and sympathetic exposition from the stand- 
point neither of the thick-and-thin disciple nor of 
the critic of the Positive Philosophy. The result 
is that we have an account which perhaps is truer 
to the real spirit of Positivism than any other that 
is available. Without advancing extreme claims 
(it is admitted, for example, that Comte is quite 
beyond the mark in his estimate of the importance 
and finality of his concrete contributions to the sci- 
ence of sociology), the author succeeds in showing 
that many of the traditional difficulties that have 
been found in Comte's system fail to get fully at 
the motives and logic of his thought. The supposed 
inconsistency between his earlier philosophy and 
his " second career," or religious period, it is argued, 
does not exist at all. So the criticisms that have 
been passed upon the classification of the sciences, 
the attitude toward psychology, the admission of 
the idea of progress, the failure to attempt a pre- 
liminary investigation of the nature of knowledge, 
and other similar objections, were all, it is pointed •

oat, anticipated by Comte himself ; and his position 
is shown to be at least the only logical consequence 
of his point of view. On the whole, a reading of 
the book, even by those who find it impossible to 
stop with the Positive Philosophy, will hardly fail 
to arouse anew a sense of the fertility, in spite of 
its aberrations, of Comte's genius, and of the im- 
mense value of the ideas for which he stood. That 
the positive spirit as interpreted by Comte, when 
taken as a final attitude toward the universe, does 
not meet all the needs of the human spirit, one may 
perhaps still be permitted to believe fifty years after 
the death of its great Apostle. Why Comte should 
have been so ready to reject certain interests as 
futile, should have been so limited in his sympathies 
along certain lines, the present volume helps to ex- 
plain by its emphasis of the nature of the soil in 
which his thought took shape, and the unsatisfactory 
character of those forms of the tendencies he op- 
posed with which he was most familiar. But while 
the completeness of his interpretation of the nature 
of human experience may be questioned, there can 
be no doubt of either the theoretical or the practical 
importance of the aspect which he brought chiefly 
to view. The disciplining of the imagination which 
Positivism involves, the reverence for concrete fact 
and law, the recognition of the essentially progres- 
sive nature of truth, and the distrust of finality and 
dogmatism, the wholesome orientating of thought 
by the ideal of human welfare, are elements of a 
temper of mind which is still far too rare in our life 
and education, and the social need of which can 
hardly be over-emphasized. 

Journal of the The fourth volume of the collected 
» Father 0/ the writings of James Madison, edited 
by Mr. Gaillard Hunt and published 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, appears as a com- 
panion volume to the third, the two comprising the 
Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. 
Mr. Madison was a constant and faithful attendant 
upon the sessions of this famous body, and as the 
champion of the '^ Virginia Plan " was the most in- 
fluential member in fashioning the Constitution as 
it was finally adopted. In the absence of modern 
machinery for accurately recording the discussions 
of a convention, Mr. Madison's self-imposed task of 
keeping extended and careful minutes of the pro- 
ceedings made him an authority in all later contro- 
versies regarding constitutional questions, and gave 
to his opinions and arguments a commanding force. 
His own notes were supplemented by additions 
made by other delegates with whom he consulted in 
the years following the Convention ; and in the two 
volumes comprising the so-called Journal of the 
Convention the editor has given footnotes citing 
statements made by members of the body whose 
papers have been published. The result of such 
careful editing is a most valuable account of the 
discussions in the Convention. There is not much 
gf general interest in these two volumes, such as 
qUo finds in Volume I. (published in October, 1900) 



or in Volume II. (published in December, 1901). 
Letters to leading men of the time, written between 
1769 and 1787, make the bulk of material for these 
first volumes ; and the reader finds in them those 
expressions of opinion, descriptions of events, and 
statements of facts, from which the life of the period 
may be known. But no collection of Madison's 
writings would be complete which failed to include 
these Convention notes by the " Father of the Con- 
stitution," which give us so clear an account of the 
ideas in the minds of these master-builders of a 
government. Forty-four pages of index, and a re- 
duced facsimile of the draft of the first page of the 
Constitution, add value to the Journal. The four 
volumes bring the life of Mr. Madison down to 
September 17, 1787, when he signed the Constitu- 
tion. Daring the next two years he played a very 
prominent part in the fight for the adoption of the 
instrument, and then gave twenty-eight additional 
years to the public service. In the opinion of many, 
his best work was done in the earlier part of his ca- 
reer ; and the four volumes of his collected writings 
will always remain the great source of information 
regarding this period of his public life. 

To prepare an intelligent account of 
sirtfTmeJSa""'^ the several nations comprised in the 

South American continent, for the 
series of historical studies known as " The Story of 
the Nations," is no easy task. For one reason^ 
these nations have not yet attained such " promi- 
nence in history " as to bring them within the scope 
of the series; nor do they appear to stand in any 
true " relation to universal history." Yet the colo- 
nization of the continent by Spain and Portugal in 
the sixteenth century, the manner in which the 
colonies were governed (or misgoverned ) for nearly 
three centuries, the struggles of the several prov- 
inces for independence early in the nineteenth cen- 
tury, and the gradual emancipation of each from 
the spell of the European Peninsular political sys- 
tems and its advancement towards liberal republican 
institutions, — all this furnishes many interesting 
and picturesque incidents which should no longer 
be left unwritten, as well as many heroic characters 
whose names and deeds should no longer remain 
unknown to readers of history. Mr. Thomas C. 
Dawson, Secretary of the United States legation to 
Brazil, and for six years a resident of the southern 
continent, is thoroughly equipped for the task of 
preparing the story of " The South American Re- 
publics" (Putnam), but to adapt his work to the 
series above mentioned he has found it necessary 
to divide it into two volumes. In Part I., which is 
now before us, he treats of Argentina, Paraguay, 
Uruguay, and Brazil. In the crowd of picturesque 
incidents comprised in the history of this eastern 
portion of the continent we miss the story of the 
rise of the Mamelucos (Mamelukes) or Paulistas of 
Brazil, who for many years maintained their inde- 
pendence of both Spain and Portugal ; and that 
of the " Reducciones " or Jesuit Mission villages.

Still, the story of the foar eastern coantries is full 
of interest, and is especially timely when the atten- 
tion of the world is heing drawn away from the 
older coantries to the rising republics of the new

which will treat of Venezuela and the republics 
lying along the western coast (Chile, Peru, Bolivia, 
Ecuador, and Columbia), which are more interest-

Adoicn-Easi ^ S^od book for all, and especially 

itory-teiier for boys, is the account of Elijah 

andpreacher. Kellogg's life and work, compiled by 
Professor William B. Mitchell of Bowdoin. This 
college graduated Kellogg in 1840, and two of its 
professors have united with other friends of the late 
popular preacher and author in the preparation of 
a memorial volume. Besides a brief review of his 
early life and sympathetic sketches of the man as 
seen and known at different periods of his active 
and useful career, the book contains, to the extent 
of more than half its bulk, many selections from 
Kellogg's writings, both prose and verse, beginning 
with the well-known declamation, '' Spartacus to the 
Gladiators." This piece was written and recited as 
a seminary exercise when Kellogg was a theological 
student at Andover, and it appears to have elec- 
trified its first audience, as it has so many hearers 
since. Excellent anecdotes abound in this biography, 
portraits and other illustrations are generously sup- 
plied, and the whole forms as interesting a picture 
of Yankee life and character as any reader could 
wish. The story of Kellogg's marriage, at the age 
of forty-one, to a bright young schoolmistress whom 
a friend had recommended, is a curious bit of ro- 
mance. But Professor Mitchell twice errs in re- 
ferring to the married life of these two as extending 
over more than forty years. From 1854 to 1890 
was the exact period covered, unless the book is 
wrong in its chronology. Messrs. Lee & Shepard, 
the publishers of Kellogg's numerous stories for 
boys, also publish this biography of the author. 

Printing in ^^- George French, one of the most 

relation to intelligent of current writers on 

graphic art. typographical Subjects, has pub- 

lished through the Imperial Press of Cleveland a 
volume on " Printing in Relation to Graphic Art." 
The purpose of the book, in the author's own not 
very happy phrasing, is " to try to establish a claim 
for printing that it is an art "; he believes that many 
of the elementary principles of graphic art, as rep- 
resented by such terms as color, tone, light and 
shade, values, etc., may successfully be applied to 
printing, and that through a more general applica- 
tion of such principles may come a greatly-needed 
improvement in typographical standards. There is 
much of truth in this contention, and it is here well 
developed and maintained. But Mr. French is not 
always to be trusted. He refers to Mr. Will 
Bradley as a "genius" in the field of printing, 
placing his name with that of William Morris in a 



" high place apart." He persists, also, in using the 
word "format" as though it were a recognized 
term for one distinct element in book-making — aft 
near as we can make out, the position of the type 
page on the leaf of paper. Now the word itself 
had best be left alone altogether, as an affectation 
of the amateur ; but if it must be used, it certainly 
has no other meaning than its English equivalent^ 
and can correctly refer only to the complete exter- 
nal /orm or make-up of a book. But notwithstand- 
ing these strictures, and others that might easily be 
made, the book is one to be commended ; and if 
supplemented with a thorough practical understand- 
ing of the subject treated, it cannot fail to prove of 
value to any printer. It is, besides, a pleasing 
piece of book-making, being well printed on hand- 
made paper and stoutly bound in marbled paper 
boards with linen back. 



Lying just across the North Channel 
County Antrim fj^j^ Scotland, Antrim County is 

in prote and verse. i , t . i . • i. i 

more Scotch than Irish in its dialect. 
Therefore it is that in Mr. John Stevenson's " Pat 
McCarty, Farmer of Antrim : his Rhymes, with a 
Setting" (Longmans, Green, & Co.), the jingling 
verse savors not a little of lowland Scotch, and not 
at all of the Irish brogue. The " setting," which is 
of prose, is English without provincial peculiarities 
except in quotations. Pat is obviously enough Mr. 
Stevenson himself. His verses are pleasing in their 
Celtic light-heartedness and frequent gleams of 
humor ; and still more pleasing, though unconsci- 
ously so, is the poet's account of their mode of com* 
position. As if communicating something unique, 
he tells us that " the method is a curious one." He 
does not sit down with malice aforethought and say. 
Go to, now, I will write a fine poem ; but he seizes 
some chance incident or situation, or catches at the 
unpremeditated rhythm of some swinging line that 
pops into his head, and from that works out his 
verses, fitting lines before and after — and there 
you are ! To the making of poetry, he gravely in- 
forms us, " an intention to write and a choice of 
subject are not necessary preliminaries." The tone 
of his interspersed prose is frank and genial, much 
information is conveyed about men and things in 
northern Ireland, and the whole is tinged with a 
generous coating of local color. The poems are 
homely in the best sense, dealing with such themes 
of perennial interest as wife and bairns, games, vis- 
itors, flowers of field and garden, walks and talks, 
love, life, and, appropriately last, death and burial. 
Free metrical versions of six psalms blend a little 
of dignity and seriousness with the lighter elements 
of this entertaining medley. 



Valuable 

Americana 

reprints. 



Two new volumes have recently ap- 
peared in the extensive series of 
Americana reprints issued by the 
Messrs. Burrows Brothers Company of Cleveland. 
The first of these volumes contains the Rev. John 
Miller's account of "New York Considered and 



1904.]

Improved." Mr. Miller came to New York in 1692, 
as chaplain to two companies of infantry stationed 
in that colony. Embarking for England after four 
years of service, he was captured by a French 
privateer and imprisoned at St. Malo. During his 
imprisonment he wrote this interesting work. It 
was printed in 1843, and again in 1862. Many 
errors in these editions are corrected in the present 
reprint, as is asserted in an introduction by Mr. 
Victor Hugo Faltsits. This reprint has been set up 
in literal form from a transcript of the manuscript 
in the British Museum. A sample page of the manu- 
script is reproduced, as well as the original maps. 
The annotating is well done, but not over-done. 
The worthy chaplain's opinion of the moral condi- 
tion of New York during the period of his incum- 
bency is not flattering. His '< improvement" is the 
usual suggestion of an American bishop. — The 
second volume is the much larger <' Lionel Wafer's 
Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America." 
It is annotated and provided with a preface by Mr. 
George Parker Winahip, and is reprinted from the 
original edition of 1699. It preserves the original 
typography and the maps and quaint illustrations. 
Translations of Wafer have appeared in Dutch, 
German, French, and Spanish. The last edition in 
English appeared in 1729. Wafer, as a buccaneer 
along the Spanish isthmus from 1680 to 1687, 
collected the information which he first published 
in 1699, at a time when attention was attracted to 
the Isthmus by Paterson's ill-fortuned Scotch colony 
on the northern coast. By placing these old works 
within the reach of modern students and readers 
the enterprising publishers are doing an invaluable 
service to the literature of American history. 

The second woman to be honored 

tJ^i/uuer3. "^'^^ » ««at apo°g the « English Men 
of Letters " is Fanny Burney, whose 
life, by Mr. Austin Dobson, forms the latest volume 
of the series (Macmillan). To say that Mr. Dobson 
has succeeded with his task is superfluous, for he is 
not given to failures ; his charmingly limpid style 
and sympathetic knowledge of the eighteenth cen- 
tury combine to make a delightful study. Miss 
Burney's Diary is of course the chief authority ; it 
is, in Mr. Dobson's mind, the novelist's best work, 
and " one of the great diaries of literature." By 
well managed excerpts from it he brings before us 
the Burney family and their brilliant circle of 
friends, from whom Fanny got her inspiration for 
the characterizations of " Evelina " and " Cecilia." 
Mr. Dobson is inclined to regard the hue and cry 
over Miss Burney's appointment to the position of 
Queen's dresser as largely a waste of good ink. 
He admits that she was totally unfitted for the 
duties of her office, and exceptionally gifted and 
clever in other directions. But he points out in re- 
buttal that when she entered Queen Charlotte's 
service she had written nothing for four years and 
had earned from her two popular novels less than 
two hundred pounds. Her advisors, then, naturally 



saw many advantages for her in an offer of two 
hundred pounds a year for life, and could not fore- 
see that the tedium and restraint of her post would 
render it intolerable. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Hawthorne's essay on " The Old Manse," being the 
introductory paper in his volume of " Mosses from an 
Old Manse," has been given a separate reprint by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., as one of the " Riv- 
erside Limited Editions." In general make-up the 
volume is similar to the reprints of Thoreau's " Friend- 
ship " and Lowell's " Democracy," previously issued in 
the same series; and like these it is charmingly printed 
in large old-style type on hand- made paper. A vig- 
nette wood-cut of the Manse in winter, printed on the 
title-page, is the only note of decoration in the book. 
Hawthorne is at his best in this tranquil idyl of the old 
Concord parsonage, and we are grateful for having it 
in a separate setting of such fitness. 

The annual volume of the " Proceedings and Ad- 
dresses" of the National Educational Association is 
always an important contribution to educational litera- 
ture. The volume for 1903, reporting the Boston 
meeting, is now published by the Association (Winona, 
Minn.), and seems to us of even more than the usual 
interest and weight. The managers of that meeting 
seem to have exerted themselves to their utmost to 
make the papers and discussions representative of the 
best educational thought as expounded by the ablest 
men in the profession, and he would be a dull teacher 
indeed who could not find much that was stimulating 
and helpful in this collection of educational discussions. 

A reissue of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's " History of 
Painting in Italy " is being imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner, and the first two volumes are now at hand. 
Their respective subjects are " Early Christian Art " 
and "Giotto and the Giottesques." The forty years 
that have elapsed since the original production of this 
standard work have brought to our knowledge many 
new facts and sifted many old conclusions, so that the 
new edition, which is almost a new work, was really 
very much needed. The editing is being done by 
Messrs. Langton Douglas and S. Arthur Strong, who 
have had the advantage of the manuscript material 
left by the authors. In its new form, the work is very 
handsomely gotten up, and is liberally illustrated. 
Brief biographies of the authors properly introduce 
the opening volume. 

To the discussion of the interesting question of 
the differences in intellectual tendencies of men and 
women. Miss Helen Bradford Thompson has added the 
results of some very careful experimental researches 
directed mainly to a presentation of the kind and 
manner of sex differences to be found in the sensory 
and motor endowments, as well as in the intellectual 
and emotional processes, of a small group of students 
who lent themselves to such tests at the University of 
Chicago. The results are difficult to summarize, be- 
cause such of them as are really general require limit- 
ations and reservations to make them accurate. The 
interested reader must accordingly be referred to the 
work itself, "Mental Traits of Sex" (University of 
Chicago Press), in which he will find the most discern- 
ing statement of the established differences between 
the sexes that has yet been pitblished.

Notes. 



The date of publication of the Herbert Spencer Au- 
tobiography has now been definitely fixed for the end 
of this month. 

Charles Kingsley's " Hypatia " is published by 
Messrs. Thomas Nelson & Sons in a leather-covered 
thin-paper edition uniform with their " Westward Ho." 

" From Agnosticism to Theism," by Mr. Charles F. 
Dole, is a brief paper, reprinted from " The Hibbert 
Journal," and published as a booklet by the James H. 
West Co. 

" Tables for Chemical Calculations," with explana- 
tions and illustrative examples, by Professor Horace L. 
Wells, is a convenient handbook published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. 

Blair's "The Grave," with Blake's illustrations as 
etched by Schiavonetti, is reproduced in miniature form 
by the Messrs. Appleton, in their series of reprints of 
famous old English books. 

A new and prettily made edition of George Sorrow's 
" Isopel Beruers," with an Introduction and Notes by 
Mr. Thomas Seccombe, will be published this month by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 

Professor Henry E. Bourne has extracted from 
Lecky's " Eighteenth Century " the chapters on " The 
French Revolution," and edited them in a separate vol- 
ume, published by Messrs. Appleton. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish " The Influence 
of Pasteur on Medical Science," an address by Dr. 
Christian Archibald Herter before the medical school 
of Johns Hopkins University. 

A second edition of Mr. Meredith Townsend's " Asia 
and Europe " is published by the Messrs. Putnam, and 
constitutes a timely addition to the current literature of 
that Far East which just now engrosses public attention. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. announce that they 
will issue shortly a reprint of Patrick Gass's Journal of 
the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The work will be in 
one volume, uniform with their library edition of Lewis 
and Clark, and will be edited by Dr. James K. Hosmer. 

Victor Rydberg's "Singoalla," translated intoEnglish 
by Mr. Axel Josephsson, is published by the Grafton 
Press. This wierd and romantic tale of the nineteenth 
century is one of the minor masterpieces of its distin- 
guished author, and we are glad to welcome it in its 
present dainty English dress. 

The original edition of Mr. Angus Hamilton's 
*' Korea " having been exhausted as soon as issued, and 
a large demand made evident for an edition at a lower 
price, Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons announce the 
immediate publication of a new popular edition of this 
most timely book. 

A work of exceptional interest is promised in the vol- 
ume on Oregon, by Professor F. H. Hodder, which 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. announce in their 
" American Commonwealths " series. It is expected 
that the book will be ready for the Lewis and Clark 
Exposition to be held at Portland next year. 

Messrs. McCIure, Phillips & Co. inaugurate their 
•** Contemporary Men of Letters " series with two small 
volumes — " Walter Pater," by Mr. Ferris Greenslet, 
and " Bret Harte," by Mr. H. W. Boynton. The vol- 
umes are essays rather than biographies, and each of 
the two is, in its way, a particularly satisfactory per- 
formance. 



Among other interesting articles in the March issue 
of " The International Studio," Miss Maude I. G. Oliver 
has an appreciative estimate of the work of M. Albert 
F. Fleury, the Chicago painter. In the value of its text, 
and especially in the beauty of its lavish pictorial equip- 
ment, " The Studio " still holds first place among art 
periodicals. 

The following three books are published by the Cen- 
tury Co., and intended primarily for school use as sup- 
plementary reading matter: " The Wonder-Book of 
Horses," by Mr. James Baldwin; "A Watcher in the 
Woods," by Mr. Dallas Lore Sharp; and " Famous Le- 
gends Adapted for Children," by Miss Emeline G. 
Crommelin. 

«' A Journal of Voyages and Travels in the Interior of 
North America," by Daniel Williams Harmon, is repro- 
duced from the original of 1820, under the editorship 
of Mr. Robert Waite, and is published by Messrs. A. S. 
Barnes & Co. in their series of reprinted Americana 
called "The Trail Makers." A map and a portrait 
constitute the illustrations. 

The A. Wessels Co. have in active preparation for 
publication in the early Spring a book by Mr. Rufus 
Rockwell Wilson entitled " New England in Letters," 
describing a series of pilgrimages to all the noteworthy 
literary landmarks of the New England States, and 
dealing with the work of each author in association with 
its background or environment. 

*« The Professional Training of Secondary Teachers 
in the United States," by Dr. G. W. A. Luckey, is a 
doctoral thesis prepared for Columbia University, and 
now published under the auspices of that institution. 
The work is a bulky volume of nearly four hundred 
pages, and constitutes a very thorough treatment of its 
subject, both historical and theoretical. 

Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. will publish early 
next month an anonymous volume entitled " The High 
Road: Being the Autobiography of an Ambitious 
Mother." They will also issue at the same time Mr. 
James William Pattison's " The World's Painters," 
previously announced but delayed until now through 
difflculties connected with the illustrations. 

Professor John Scholte NoUen has compiled, and 
Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. have published, " A 
Chronology and Practical Bibliography of Modern Ger- 
man Literature," which students will find very helpful. 
The Chronology is comparative, and the Bibliography 
is in the main individual, although a group of general 
works is listed. The book is interleaved. 

A collection of short stories by Mr. Henryk Sienkie- 
wicz is announced for publication this Spring by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co., his authorized publishers in this 
country. These stories have been translated by Mr. 
Jeremiah Curtin, who has just paid the great Polish 
author a visit at his home in Warsaw. The title of the 
book will be " Life and Death and Other Legends and 
Stories." 

Besides the reprint of Hawthorne's "The Old Manse " 
which they have just issued, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. have nearly ready in their series of " Riverside 
Press Editions " a volume containing Chaucer's " The 
Parlement of Foules," printed in distinctive and at- 
tractive form. In their recently-announced series of 
« Special Limited Editions " they will publish shortly a 
volume of " Facts Relating to the Death of Alexander 
Hamilton " and a collection of " Documents Relating 
to the Purchase and Exploration of Louisiana."

««A History of the United States for Secondary 
Schools," by Mr. J. N. Larned, is published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It is a work admirably ap- 
•pointed in all respects, and planned in accordance with 
the most advanced thought respecting the teaching of 
this subject in our high schools. We can recommend it 
as one of the two or three best text books of our history 
now accessible to American teachers. 

Mr. Maurice Kufferath's book on " The Parsifal of 
IRichard Wagner " was first translated and published 
twelve years ago. It is now reissued with a special 
introduction by Mr. H. E. Krehbiel. The translation is 
hj Miss Louise M. Henermann, and the publishers are 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The illustrations are ex- 
amples in musical notation and photographs taken on 
the stage during the recent New York production of the 
-drama. 

The Johns Hopkins Press publishes an edition of the 
*' Poema de Fernan Gonzalez " in a critical text, with 
introduction, notes, and a glossary, under the editorship 
of Professor C. Carroll Marden. This old Spanish epic 
is almost as important as the poem of " The Cid," and 
the editor has given us a true thirteenth-century version, 
restored by the collation of all existing manuscripts and 
other sources. The editorial work is all in Spanish, 
and there are two photographic facsimiles. 

Under the direction of the Royal Society of Litera- 
ture, Mr. Henry Frowde is about to publish two inter- 
esting works. One is the " Chronicles of Adam of Usk," 
edited with a translation and notes by Sir E. Naunde 
Thompson. This contains the complete chronicle from 
1377 to 1421. The other volume is " Queen Elizabeth 
and the Levant Company," the history of a diplomatic 
and literary episode of the establishment of our trade 
with Turkey, edited by the Rev. H. G. Rosedale, D.D. 

Besides the new edition of Mrs. Hugh Eraser's 
^< Letters from Japan," the Macmillan Co. announce for 
publication this month new editions of Mr. Wirt Ger- 
rare's " Greater Russia " and Mr. Archibald R. Colqu- 
houn's " The Mastery of the Pacific." New editions of 
these three books have been called forth by the demand 
arising from the war in the East. The same publishers 
also announce that Mr. Francis H. Skrine's « The Ex- 
pansion of Russia," which was for some time out of 
print, can now be had. 

Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co., publish an edition of 
^« The Berthe of Hercules," a seventeenth century play 
inspired by Plautus, and existing in a single manuscript 
preserved in the British Museum. This is the first time 
the play has found its way into print. Mr. Malcolm W. 
Wallace has edited the text, and, besides providing the 
usual notes, has prefaced it with a lengthy introduction 
•devoted to the general subject of the influence of Plau- 
tus upon early English dramatic literature. 

A work that should prove of much usefulness to Bible 
students is announced by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
in " The Student's Old Testament," to be issued in six 
volumes under the editorship of Mr. Charles Foster 
Kent, Ph.D. This work gives a logical and chronolog- 
ical arrangement of the Old Testament, rearranging 
systematically the early songs, primitive traditions, tribal 
stories, laws, exhortations, and historical narratives. It 
presents a clear translation not only of the words, but 
also of the ideas and the spirit of the original texts. 
The introductions and explanatory notes will give all 
needed explanations of obscurities of the texts and of the 
historical and geographical connections. 



Announcembnts of Spring Books. 

Herewith is presented The Dial's annual list of 
books announced for Spring publication, containing this 
year over seven hundred titles. Such early Spring 
books as have already been issued, and entered in the 
regular "List of New Books" contained in this or 
recent numbers of The Dial, are not included in the 
present list; and all the books here given are pre- 
sumably new books — new editions not being named 
unless having new form or matter. The list is com- 
piled from authentic data especially secured for this 
purpose, and presents a reliable survey of the Spring 
books of 1904.

OOOK publishers and book journals are 
■*-^ alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous jom*nals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. AU 
the readers of a book journal are bookisli 
people. The Dial is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 



T^HE DIAL is more generally consulted 
*■ and depended upon by Libkakians in 
making up orders for books than any 
other American critical journal ; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other jom-nal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.

BARRETT. Abraham Lincoln and His Presidency. By J. H. Barrett, author of a " Life of Lincoln." 2 vols., 

crown 8vo, cloth, gilt tops, net, $5.00. (Postage, 38 cents.) 

ThiB long-expected life of Lincoln fills an important place in the list of biographies of this remarkable man, and will prove a notable contri- 
bution to the field of American biography and history. It is an entirely new work, having the advantage of the contemporary point of view by the 
author who knew him intimately, combined with that of the matured judgment gained by years of study of the man whose character was the 
brightest thing the country produced during an epoch of gloom. It contains much new and valuable material, including unpublished letters, new 
anecdotes illustrative of Lincoln's character, and corrects many errors of fact and inference that have gained general currency. 

TUNISON. The Qraal Problem. From Walter Map to Richard Wagner. By J. S. Tukison, author of "Master 
Virgil," " The Sapphic Stanza," etc. 1 vol., 12mo, cloth, net, $1.25. (Postage, 10 cents.) 
The theme of the Holy Graal is one of perennial interest. It stirs the poets and romancers of our own day as it did those of a remote past. 

Arthur and his circle of knights are but shadows of the men who made the politics and quarreled over the religion reflected in the Stories of the 

Oraal. These men of flesh and blood, who were capable of filling whole centuries with their activities, are worth considering in the study of a 

literature which they occasioned. Briefly to bring them to mind is the aim of this book. 

SCHROEDER. Applied Materia Medica. A Working Text-book intended for the use of Nurses in Hospital Train- 
ing Schools. By J. Henry Schroeder, Ph.G., M.D. 12mo, cloth, net, $1.25. (Postage, 10 cents.) 
A volume that nurses have been wishing for ; a work indispensable to nurses ; a guide in practical daily work with drugs and medicines. 
BLAKE. The Man with the Hoe. "Astorythrobbingwith the true inwardness of life and love on the farm." By 
Adam Blake. 12mo, cloth, illustrated, $1.50. 

A picture of American farm life as it is to-day, told in an attractive way that will interest both old and young. Humor and pathos are inter- 
woven in the story, and around it all is entwined a love story of high literary merit.

" The cleverest book of the year, and 
of many years. The authors have 
given us perfect pictures of selfishness 
and conceit, with just enough of purer 
elements to take away the bitter taste. 
It is a real literary achievement." 

— Britith, Weekly. 

"An admirable burlesque. Each 
of the letters is amusing, and the book 
is one of the best examples of its

"THE CLEVEREST BOOK OF THE YEAR" 

"THE WOODHOUSE CORRESPONDENCE" 

By GEORGE W. E. RUSSELL and EDITH SICHEL 
"Studies in idiosyncrasy" these letters are called by the authors. They are the 
cleverest, wittiest and at the same time keenest studies that we have seen in a 

long time. Selfishness is the 
prevailing idiosyncrasy, vari- 
ous forms of which not un- 
known in polite society, such 
as the selfishness of the hy- 
pochondriac, of the artistic 
temperament, of the strong- 
minded person, are set forth 
by the unconscious corre- 
spondents in a manner that 
is at once delightfully naive 



" Our brief outline gives but an 
inadequate impression of the remark- 
able and cruel cleverness with which 
various phases of fastidious egotism, 
valetudinarianism, stinginess, precoc- 
ity, and snobbery are here hit off." 

— The Spectator. 

"The intellectual pleasure to be 
derived from such a book is as rarely 
encountered as it is welcome." 

— Philadelphia Record.

Memoirs of Henry Villard 

Journalist and Financier 
1835-1900 

Two volumes, with Portraits and Maps. $5.00 net. Postage, 35 cents. 

AN autobiographical record of the varied and romantic career of the war journalist who 
subsequently became a power in the financial world, and carried the Northern Pacific

other prominent men of the time, as well as for its descriptions of important battles of the 
Civil War. 

" A book of extraordinary interest. It is written with great ability, in a clear and flowing 
style ; it details with perfect candor the incidents of a great career ; it is an admirable report 
of great events, all of which the writer saw, and a large part of which (after 1870) he was; 
it exhibits the rise and growth of a rich and powerfiU personality and a character at once 
remarkable for its simplicity and its variety." — John White Chadwick, in the New York

EDWIN ARNOLD. 



Sir Edwin Arnold died on the twenty-fourth 
of March, in the seventy-second year of his 
age. The physical ailments of his later life, 
including the crowning calamity of blindness, 
must have made death a welcome release to 
him, since the close of his days brought him 
the satisfaction of one who can look back upon 
a long and useful career and feel that its essen- 
tial aims have been worthily accomplished, its 
destined work completely done. And reading 
of his death, we think instinctively of the 



words of his own poem, spoken from the tomb 
of him " who died at Azan " and after sent a 
message of comfort to his friends. 
" Allah glorious! Allah good! 

Now thy world is understood; 

Now the long, long wonder ends; 

While ye weep, my erring friends, 

While the man whom ye call dead, 

In unspoken bliss, instead, 

Lives and loves you ; lost, 't is true, 

By such light as shines for you; 

But in light ye cannot see 

Of unf ulfiU'd felicity, — 

In enlarging paradise. 

Lives a life that never dies." 

Many and varied were the deeds and the 
distinctions of this accomplished scholar, jour- 
nalist, and poet. Bearing his Oxford honors 
as a Newdigate prizeman, he became master of 
an English public school, but after two years 
resigned this post to accept the principalship of 
a government college in Bombay. This sojourn 
in the East, which lasted for five years, gave to 
his life the definite direction which it ever after- 
wards kept, as far as its expression in litera- 
ture was concerned. He buried himself in the 
study of the languages, the religions, and the 
poetry of India, and, although he never became 
an oriental scholar in the exacting sense of 
philological science, he acquired a sufficient 
knowledge of certain aspects of oriental thought 
to become their efficient interpreter to the 
Western world. Returning to England in 
1861, he began his connection with the London 
" Daily Telegraph," and his editorial relations 
with that newspaper continued to occupy him 
for the remainder of his days. He revisited the 
East more than once in his later years, and it 
remained the one lasting and inexhaustible inter- 
est of his life. He was three times married, 
showing in this a fine cosmopolitan taste, for his 
first wife was an Englishwoman, his second an 
American (the daughter of our own W. H. Chan- 
ning, the successor of Martineau in Liverpool), 
and his third, who now survives him, a Japan- 
ese woman of much intelligence and charm. 

It must be admitted that Sir Edwin's repu- 
tation has declined considerably of recent 
years. It is just a quarter of a century since 
the publication of " The Light of Asia," which 
bore him upon the full flood of popular fame. 
This poem was followed by many others — ori- 
ginal compositions and translated masterpieces 
of Hindu and Persian literature — but none of

its successors ever had anything approaching 
the immense vogue of his sympathetic and 
profound study of the legend and gospel of 
Buddhism. A number of years after the ap- 
pearance of that work, urged on by the charge 
of having exalted paganism at the expense of 
Christianity, he sought to provide it with a 
companion work in praise of the latter, but 
" The Light of the World," as the new poem 
was styled, fell so far below the level of the 
earlier one that it is not to be mentioned in 
the same breath. Where the poem of Buddh- 
ism was glowing and impassioned and sincere, 
the poem of Christianity proved colorless" and 
rhetorical and artificial ; it had clearly been a 
task to be performed, not a labor of love to be 
wrought out with spontaneous enthusiasm. 

It is, then, upon the author of *' The Light 
of Asia " that whatever permanent fame may 
become attached to the memory of Sir Edwin 
must rest. And that poem seems to us really 
deserving of lasting remembrance. It is not 
creative work, except in the sense in which all 
work inspired by deep sympathy recreates its 
object, but as an interpretation of Eastern 
ideals for Western minds and hearts it is 
hardly matched in English literature. Fitz- 
Gerald's Omar is better poetry, no doubt, but 
the poetry is his, and not Omar's ; and in all 
the long line of Englishmen, from Sir William 
Jones to " A. E." and Mr. Rudyard Kipling, 
who have brought the message of India to our 
occidental ears, there has been no other whose 
actual success may be reckoned comparable 
with that achieved by the author of " The 
Light of Asia." The message proved particu- 
larly appealing to our American sense, for it 
enlarged upon a theme with which Emerson 
had toyed, and with which the whole of trans- 
cendental New England had been, with more 
zeal than knowledge, it is true, mysteriously 
and intimately concerned. 

The prose writings of Sir Edwin, whether or 
not they attained the dignity of book publica- 
tion, are journalism, and, as such, having served 
their purpose, have ceased to be. His original 
verse was rarely marked by the true poetical 
accent, and, save for such occasional pieces as 
the anthologies may preserve, will not be read 
by his posterity. But he had just enough of 
the technique of the art to stand him in excel- 
lent stead as a translator, and students of com- 
parative literature to whom the Eastern origi- 
nals are sealed will long find his versions 
pleasing and helpful. Most of all will such stu- 
dents be grateful to him for his translations from 



the great epic of the "Mahabharata," and parti- 
cularly for his exquisitely sympathetic version of 
the " Bhagavad-Gita," which he rightly styled 
" The Song Celestial." This book seems to us, 
among the many bearing Sir Edwin's name, to 
stand next in importance to the one by which he 
is most widely known, and we will close our brief 
tribute to the work of his life by quoting from 
the volume this parable of the banyan tree : 

" They call the Aswattha — the Banyan tree, 
Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots on high — 
The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves 
Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth! 
Who knoweth well the Aswattha, knows all. 

Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth, 
Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth 

From qualities; its silver sprays and blooms, 
And all the eager verdure of its girth. 

Leap to quick life at touch of sun and air, 
As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair 

Of wooing sense. Its hanging rootlets seek 
The soil beneath, helping to hold it there, 

As actions wrought amid this world of men 
Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again. 

If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree, 
What its shape saith, and whence it springs, and, then, 

How it must end, and all the ills of it. 

The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet 

And cleave the clinging, snaky roots and lay 
This Aswattha of sense-life low — to set 

New growths upspringing to that happier sky. 
Which they who reach shall have no day to die, 

Nor fade away, nor fall — to Him, I mean. 
Father and First, Who made the mystery 

Of old Creation; for to Him come they 
From passion and from dreams who break away ; 
Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh. 
And — Him, the Highest, worshiping alway — 

No longer grow at mercy of what breeze 
Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees. 

What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem, 
To the eternal world pass such as these. 

Another Sun gleams there! Another Moon! 
Another Light — a Light which none shall lack 

Whose eyes once see; for those return no prore. 
They have attained My Uttermost Abode!" 



THE REVIEWER. 



No doubt the happiest field of criticism lies out- 
side of contemporary literatm-e, but an important 
field lies inside; and in this the reviewer works. 
His conception of the truth about contemporary 
writing will lack certain safeguards which time and 
detachment afford the critic of the past. The ele- 
ments of personal prejudice or convenience, of pres- 
sure from within or from without, endanger his 
clearness of vision and his frankness of utterance. 
The difficulties of his position are many and serious 
enough to have led so keen an observer as M. Jules

Lemaitre to announce that "the criticism of our 
contemporaries is not really criticism, but simply 
conversation." This seems to be altogether too sweep- 
ing a dictum. It fairly asperses the value of any 
soi't of individual judgment. We cannot wait for the 
opinion of posterity upon the chai-acter of our next- 
door neighbors ; nor will it necessarily be true that 
our expressed opinion of them is nothing more than 
gossip, though the chance may lie that way. 

It is the business of the reviewer to express his 
opinion of next-door literature. His duty, like that 
of any other critic, is to see as clearly as he can, 
and to tell precisely what he sees. He had better 
not be thinking much about his liability to error ; it 
is enough to do as well as he can. I do not mean 
that his judgments ought to be based upon mere 
whim or prejudice ; if they are, he is not a critic in 
any serious sense. For criticism, as Ai'nold said 
long ago, " is the art of seeing the object as in itself 
it really is "; and the critic is of value in proportion 
as his vision approximates perfection. The great 
critic is born and made. His naturally keen vision 
is refined, before it reaches its highest power, by 
every contact : by contact with life ; with literature ; 
finally, with the classics of criticism. At the end of 
aU this, it remains for him only to tell what, as the 
result of his being and knowing, he does actually 
see. The honest expression of a firm and reasonable 
opinion — this is the object which a critic has before 
him ; his rank depends upon the plane of reason in 
which his judgments are formed. Shiftlessness of 
opinion and insincerity of expression are the only 
crimes which can be charged against a reviewer ; his 
other errors wUl be due to limitations which he can- 
not remove. 

Moreover, personality, as well as intellect, con- 
tributes to the effectiveness of the critic. True criti- 
cism, we have begun to see of late, is as much a 
means of self-expression as any of the forms which 
are commonly called creative. The fact has been 
most strikingly suggested by M. Anatole France in 
his definition of criticism as ''the adventm-es of a 
soul among masterpieces." This suggests the chief 
point of disadvantage for the critic of the contem- 
porary, or reviewer. His adventures must often be 
upon a lower, at least a more dubious level. His 
function cannot be agreeably limited to the walled 
gardens of literature ; and he will not find master- 
pieces bursting from every hedgerow. He is defi- 
nitely committed to a contest of research of which 
the notable prizes must be few. He must travel in all 
places and in all companies. He cannot, as Ruskin 
advised, keep out of the salt swamps of literature, 
and live on a little rocky island, or, as Schopen- 
hauer urged, devote his time for reading " exclu- 
sively to those great minds of all times and aU 
countries who overtop the rest of humanity, those 
whom the voice of fame points to as such." He 
is, in fact, a drudge of fame. His reward is, now 
and then, to hit upon merit, to hit upon truth, to 
feel himself not only the drudge of fame, but the 
herald of excellence. At such moments he has 



nothing to ask of fate ; the world is his, and the 
fulness thereof. 

But why all this stress upon honesty ? Is there any 
reason for a reviewer's being anything but honest? 
There are many reasons — more perhaps in Amer- 
ica than elsewhere. England still presei'ves a taste 
for robust criticism. It rather likes the battering 
method ; it does not grudge the "Satm-day Review " 
its fun. One can perceive a theory behind this 
method, to the effect that if a reviewer (who is 
free to write or not) cannot find a book good 
enough to write about, the next best thing is to find 
one bad enough. Either will give him opportunity 
to enunciate, or to illustrate, some important critical 
principle. This is not the American theory. We 
are given to understand that a reviewer should 
ignore what he cannot praise. It is his duty to 
speak only of books about which he can find some- 
thing amiable to say. He is to be a guide, but not 
a guardian, of the public. Unfortunately, the ordi- 
nary reviewer has obvious reasons for speaking of 
books in which no cvdtivated taste can find occasion 
for praise ; and he is too likely to succumb to the 
general demand for amenity. 

But let us consider the extraordinary reviewer, 
the writer who is free to treat only such books as 
commend themselves to his taste. Is he altogether 
absolved from the duty of warning his audience 
against meretricious work upon which the perfunc- 
tory reviewer is pronouncing sUly encomiums? It 
is quite true that the best service of criticism is 
affirmative. We are in no danger of underrating 
the value of Professor Dowden's assertion that " The 
most valuable critic is the critic who communicates 
sympathy by an exquisite record of his own de- 
lights." The purest pleasure, the highest profit, lies 
in constructive work ; nobody covets the office of 
literary headsman. Yet it is a necessary office, and 
there is no reason why the reviewer shovdd feel him- 
self culpable in occasionally undertaking it. He is 
not so fatuous as to imagine that his comment upon 
a book will have a mysterious power of adding 
to or subtracting from its value. The immediate 
circulation of a book may conceivably be affected 
by somebody's opinion of it ; its quality, and conse- 
quently its permanent standing, can be in no way 
affected. Works of merit do not always speak for 
themselves at once ; works of no merit very com- 
monly speak beyond themselves. It is for the re- 
viewer to offer some intelligible surmise as to the 
value of one as well as of the other. 

The especial temptation of the American reviewer 
is to concern himself more with persons and with 
volumes of printed matter than with qualities and 
principles. He thinks of the author, he thinks of 
the publisher, he thinks of the public — they aU like 
to hear pleasant things said. He says them. This 
is not a method of criticism; that is, it is not a 
respectful method of approaching an author or his 
work. An ingenious argument is sometimes advanced 
in favor of it, based upon the theory that the duty 
of the reviewer is not only to judge literature, but to 



230 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



encourage authors. We are assm'ed that there must 
be no more instances like that of the poor young 
Keats. I can only say that this theory of the re- 
viewer's function seems to me altogether false. It 
is his sole business to express his opinion of the 
abstract value of a book as literature. It is a pub- 
lisher's business to express his opinion of its concrete 
value as a commodity. If it falls to anybody in his 
official capacity to encourage, to deprecate, to dis- 
tinguish between promise and achievement, it falls 
to the editor. Every good editor wiU succeed in 
bringing out much valuable new material by this 
sort of manipulation. But the critic is under obli- 
gation only to the truth as he sees it. The moment 
he begins to falter, to qualify, to mitigate the sub- 
stance of his criticism, he makes it worthless. To its 
form he may well give the highest possible degree 
of amenity. 

These principles cannot be too strictly kept in 
mind by the reviewer whose critical integrity finds 
itself wavering under, it may be, the fourfold pres- 
sure of author, editor, publisher, and public. He is 
a judge, or he is a mere fabricator of book-notices. 
It is not his business to help the sale of books, or to 
coddle sensitive authors, or to make everybody feel 
comfortable about everything. Discrimination is al- 
ways offensive in one quarter or another ; and the 
reviewer discriminates or is lost.

GOMMUNICA TION. 



THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 1493-1898. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
Permit us to offer a few lines of explanation regard- 
ing some points in the review of " The Philippine 
Islands — 1493-1898," which appeared in your issue of 
March 16. The reviewer, while erecting admirable 
standards of criticism, seems to have some misconcep- 
tions regarding the scope of that work and the attitude 
of its editors. It is not intended to be per se a history 
of the islands, but is rather a careful and thoroughly 
impartial selection of the best documentary material 
available, as being the original sources for such history. 
As such, the editors conceive that it is their part to pre- 
sent these documents in faithful reproduction and trans- 
lation, permitting their writers to speak for themselves, 
and their readers to form through perusal their own 
opinions. The editors do not feel called upon to inter- 
pret or criticise the text; or to intrude their own opin- 
ions in regard to any of the vexed questions that arise; 
or to perform all the research, comparison, and sifting 
that are necessary in order to reach any just conclu- 
sions thereon — processes that pertain to the historian 
rather than to the editor. The prefaces are written 
atrietly in accordance with this view; they are simply 
synopses of the documents contained in the respective 
volumes, and in these summaries the standpoint of each 
writer is recognized and admitted; otherwise, the edi- 
tors could not maintain their attitude (adopted from the 
very inception of their work) of impartial and unbiased 
observation and record of the panorama of history as it 
is unfolded in the successive volumes of the series. 



Anyone who wishes to verify this premise need only 
compare the synopsis given in the preface with the text 
of the document itself: e. g., in Vol. VII. (pp. 22-24), 
Salazar's letters to the king, and his controversy with 
Dasmariiias regarding the Indian tributes; in Vol. VIII. 
(pp. 10, 11), the governor's replies to the bishop; in 
Vol. X. (p. 11), Morga's accusations against the eccle- 
siastics; in Vol. XII., Bishop Benavides's criticisms on 
all the religious orders, and Chirino's history of the 
Jesuit missions; etc. 

In the numerous annotations which accompany each 
volume, the editors have aimed to supply such informa- 
tion — historical, geographical, biographical, scientific, 
and bibliographical — as will elucidate obscure or dif- 
ficult points that may arise in the text. No one can 
realize more clearly than do the editors themselves the 
deficiencies in these respects that exist in the earlier 
volumes — partly due to inexorable limitations of time 
and space, and partly unavoidable in the beginning of 
any series so long and extensive as this ; but they trust 
that future volumes will show improvement in these 
respects. In the annotations they have preserved the 
same impartial attitude, as, for instance, the note on the 
Inquisition (Vol. V., p. 258), in which the best histo- 
rians — Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish — are cited 
for the reader's benefit. The editors prefer, instead of 
offering their own opinions, to point out to the student 
the leading authorities, regardless of partisan or sec- 
tarian tendencies. It is certainly not their business to in- 
dulge in "critical comment " or " definitive conclusions " 
— from which, indeed, they have throughout sedulously 
refrained. It may be here incidentally noted that Craw- 
furd's allusion to the Filipinos as " half-naked savages " 
at the time of their discovery by the Spaniards (Vol. I., 
p. 72) is simply a phrase in his statement regarding the 
character of the Spanish administration in the Philip- 
pines, and is not adopted or even noticed by Professor 
Bourne; and that the latter has, in his introduction to 
the series, cited many authorities besides Morga and 
ZiiSiga. 

The subjects of legislation for the Spanish colony in 
the islands and for the protection of the natives, and of 
social conditions among both peoples, are certainly of 
the utmost importance ; and examination of the first ten 
volumes shows that much has been given therein on 
these matters, e.g., royal decrees, the constitution of 
the Audiencia, ordinances enacted by that body, instruc- 
tions given to the governors, account of the encomien- 
das in 1591, and Plasencia's account of the customs of 
the Tagalos (which was written by direction of the 
Audiencia for the guidance of the courts). Then, too, 
may be found accounts of the early hospitals, benevo- 
lent enterprises, schools, and colleges of San Josd, as 
well as of the cathedral and other churches — all these 
activities being in operation, less than thirty years after 
the foundation of Spanish Manila. 

Finally, as regards judgments and decisions in any 
Philippine problems, especially on that of the friar con- 
troversy, the editors can only reiterate their previous 
statements of their non-partisan and non-sectarian atti- 
tude toward all these questions; and their aim of pre- 
senting to both students and the general public the 
historical material which must be the only basis for 
intelligent and fair opinions thereon.

New liETTERS OF THE CHELSEA SAGE.* 



k 



The best possible life of Carlyle — best be- 
cause self-told — is now completed with two 
volumes of " New Letters," carefully chosen 
from a great number hitherto unpublished, 
and edited, in such a manner as to be so far as 
possible self-explanatory, by Mr. Alexander 
Carlyle, Thomas Carlyle's nephew. This book 
is the more welcome as no really satisfactory 
biography of Carlyle has yet appeared. It 
contains 395 letters, arranged chronologically, 
and issued in two volumes of uniform appear- 
ance with the recently published " New Let- 
ters of Jane Welsh Carlyle." Considering the 
*' immense number " of letters from which the 
editor tells us he has made his selection, and 
the copious correspondence already given to 
the public, one may well ask how it was that 
a man of such productiveness in books ever 
found time or inclination to put forth so many 
letters. This and other matters of interest 
find mention in the following extract from the 
editor's Preface : 

" Carlyle's Letters are generally the unpremeditated, 
spontaneous expression of his thoughts and feelings at 
the moment of writing, set down with perfect candour 
and sincerity, in his rapid, fluent style; there are char- 
acteristic touches of his genius in nearly every one of 
them, even in his briefest Notes; whilst many of them 
are equal in literary qualities to the best of his pub- 
lished writings. Yet they reveal withal the heart of 
their writer perhaps more than his genius; they bear 
evidence that the man who wrote them was not only 
sincere and candid, but also kindly disposed, full of 
sympathy and active helpfulness, ever ready with wise 
advice, friendly encouragement and practical benefi- 
cence to all those with whom he was brought in con- 
tact. ... To no honest enquirer after truth or seeker 
of advice, did Carlyle turn a deaf ear; during the 
greater part of his life, busy or not busy, he seems to 
have answered every correspondent whether known to 
him or not." 

A few letters to Carlyle, e.g. from his 
mother, from Bismarck, from Leigh Hunt, are 
judiciously inserted as necessary to the under- 
standing of those written by him. It goes 
without saying that the book as a whole will 
delight those who seek in epistolary literature 
something other than conventional banalities 
and outworn forms. Its pages bristle with the 
writer's gruff whimsicalities and humorously 
atrabilious outbursts. In the striking and exag-

gerated depiction of mental and bodily states of 
unease and disgust both he and his brilliant wife 
took the delight of true literary artists. Some- 
what as his admired Goethe turned his affairs of 
the heart into literature, and so got rid of them, 
Carlyle worked off in his letters to intimates 
those humors that most vexed him at the time. 
It was not his way to burn his own smoke. 
"Let us lie and rest and say nothing," he 
writes ; and straightway proceeds not to do it. 
But who would have it otherwise ? The burst 
of almost boisterous laughter that we seem to 
hear after each absurdly splenetic deliverance 
relieves it of all appearance of ill nature. 
Indeed, the writer himself is more than half- 
conscious that without something to growl at 
he would not be happy. In the midst of his 
fretting and fuming over the " French Revo- 
lution " — a piece of writing that made him, 
as he declared, " all biliousness and fret and 
palpitating haste and bewilderment " — he was 
yet moved to add : 

" I often think it is a great malady and madness this 
poor Book of mine, which wears me so, and has been 
80 unlucky: yet rather I should say, it is a great hap- 
piness, and gives me the completest indifference towards 
all fretting of fortune, towards much that has haunted 
me like pale spectres all my life long. ... I stand 
serene under the sky, and really have the peaceablest 
fearlessness towards all men and things." 

And he winds up a letter to his brother. Dr. 
Carlyle : *' Never mind these hypochondrias 
of mine ; at bottom, nothing wrong." 

It has often been said of Carlyle's literary 
methods, that whereas he made a terrible 
pother about a book while it was in the writ- 
ing, he banished it utterly from his thoughts 
as soon as it was printed and off his hands. 
This is not strictly true. When the agonies of 
parturition were over, he took a lively interest 
in his literary offspring's commercial fortunes. 
Sending a package of books to his mother soon 
after the appearance of "Sartor" in book form, 
he says : 

" But the finest item of the collection, you will say, 
I hope, is Teu/elsdrockh, fairly at last in the shape of 
a Book ! They have got it out finally, after long delays ; 
and it will take its lot like other things. It is not a 
pretty volume, not at all finely done off; but on the 
whole I care next to nothing at all about it, or about 
what comes of it, — 'a kirk and a mill ' if the world 
like : I had fairly done with it almost seven years ago." 

With him, " I don't care " means what it 
does with most of us : we do care a great deal, 
but say to ourselves that we don't, and that 
we won't let people think that we do ; where- 
upon our anxiety, like Queen Gertrude's guilt, 
"spills itself in fearing to be spilt." Yet it

is just these delightfully human touches that 
endear the Letters and their writer to all read- 
ers. Another thing that interests is the fre- 
quent mention of progress or hindrance in this 
or that literary work. We seem to see the 
book growing from day to day, and to share 
the author's hopes and fears regarding its suc- 
cess. Here is a passage referring to a chapter 
in the " French Revolution ": 

"The Chapter is longer than I expected; not right, 
yet it must do. I have a great lesson to learn: that of 
einmal fertig werden [getting done once for all]. Much 
poring does but confuse, and reduce all to caudle. Get 
it done, and let there be an end! The bricklayer does 
not insist on all being as smooth as marble, but only on 
all having a certain degree of smoothness and straight- 
ness; and so he gets a wall done." 

Many glimpses of contemporary notabilities 
are given us in these pages. The poet Rogers 
is rather ruthlessly pictured as having "no 
hair at all, but one of the whitest bald scalps, 
blue eyes, shrewd, sad and cruel ; toothless 
horse-shoe mouth drawn up to the very nose : 
slow-croaking sarcastic insight, perfect breed- 
ing." Of the young Queen he wrote in 1838, 
after seeing her driving in one of the parks, 
that she seemed '^ a bit modest, nice, sonsy 
little lassie ; blue eyes, light hair, fine white 
skin ; of extremely small stature : she looked 
timid, anxious, almost frightened. ... I was 
heartily sorry for the poor bairn." Miss Marti- 
neau is thus turned off : " Good Harriet, there 
is such a lively dispatch in her, such a sharp 
needling compactness, one wishes her heartily 
well — at a distance," Fitting place may be 
found here for Count d'Orsay's exclamation 
after viewing Shelley's bust in Carlyle's house, 
where the Italian was making a call. " Ah ! 
It is one of those faces who weesh to swallow 
their chin." Somewhat longer shall be our 
quotation from the letter wherein occurs ap- 
preciative mention of Emerson, as early as 
1836, soon after the death of his brother 
Charles. 

" Emerson the American friend writes me a most 
gentle affectionate Letter about the sudden death of a 
beloved Brother of his. He was one of the most prom- 
ising young men in America, I understand; was just 
going to be married, and Emerson was ' enlarging his 
house ' for new accommodation, — when alas the Nar- 
row House proved the one appointed! — He is a good 
man, that Emerson; nothing can be better than the 
pious way he takes his great loss. He has sent a little 
Book of his writing too, which is extremely good in 
spirit." 

The book referred to is evidently " Nature." 

On the occasion of Carlyle's eightieth birth- 
day, an anniversary duly celebrated in En- 



gland and Scotland, the octogenarian received 
a congratulatory letter from Prince Bismarck. 
Carlyle's reply betrays perhaps just a shade 
more than we might wish of that self-abase- 
ment before princes and potentates which is 
not uncharacteristic of the true Briton. But 
the reader shall judge for himself. Here is the 
letter, which, a footnote seems to indicate, the 
editor now publishes for the first time : 

"Sir. — On Saturday morning, which was my eightieth, 
and probably enough my last. Birthday, I was honoured 
with a Letter, by far the remarkablest, the least ex- 
pected and the most agreeable that came to me on that 
occasion. This is the noble, wise, sincere and generous 
Letter, which you have been pleased to write, and 
which I read with very great surprise and very great 
and lasting pleasure. Permit me to say that no honour 
could have been done to me, which I should have 
valued so much, or which shall live more brightly in my 
thoughts for the rest of my time in this world. What 
you deign to say of my poor History of your great 
King Friedrich seems to me the most pertinent and 
flattering utterance I have yet anywhere heard on that 
subject; and I am truly proud of it from such a quarter. 

" With very great sincerity, I warmly thank you for 
your goodness; and shall continue to wish for you, as I 
have long done, every prosperity in your great and 
noble career, and that God may grant you years and 
strength to fulfil, or carry beyond risk of failure, the 
grand and salutary enterprise in which you have already 
gone so far, in sight of all the world. 

" I have the honour to be and remain, 
" Sir, 

" Your obliged and obedient servant, 

« T. Carlyle." 

Of all the letters in these handsome volumes, 
letters that vary in tone and degree of intimacy 
to suit the recipients, those to Dr. John Carlyle, 
apparently the most congenial of the writer's 
brothers, are the best ; at any rate, they con- 
tain the most of literary and general interest. 
His affectionate missives to his " Goody," as 
he playfully styles his wife, will appeal strongly 
to women readers. The wifely devotion so 
abundantly made manifest in Mrs. Carlyle's 
letters to her "dear," is answered with an equal 
tenderness and solicitude on the husband's 
part. To his mother, also, Carlyle wrote fre- 
quent letters of the most affectionate sort, now 
and then enclosing a five-pound note from his 
rather slender and precarious income. Of that 
income, however, one is glad to note that as 
early as 1847 it was becoming very respectable. 
" I get regularly," he writes in that year, " a 
kind of rent from these poor Books of mine ; 
some two or three hundred pounds a-year of 
late." 

Of the nine illustrations in these volumes, 
five are portraits of Carlyle, who, despite his 
contemptuous references to his " old carcase,"

Reconstructions of the Oi.d 
Astronomy.* 



During the past few years the old- line con- 
servative astronomer has been considerably 
shaken up. The construction of large telescopes, 
the application of photography, and the zeal of 
certain keen-eyed observers in various parts of 
the world, have been the means of upsetting 
several ancient notions. 

Astronomers in general shook their heads 
when they saw the drawings of Schiaparelli 
which showed the delicate tracery of the canals 
on Mars. But in a few years the evidence ac- 
cumulated by various observers put the ques- 
tion of the existence of these markings beyond 
cavil. When the "canals" were found to 
cross certain supposed "seas," and at times 
appeared to become mysteriously double, the 
old-time astronomer was more mystified than 
ever, and wondered whether he had not better 
take to agriculture or some other quiet and 
respectable means of earning his livelihood. 

But might he not at least hide himself in the 
vast deeps of the nebular hypothesis, intrenched 
behind supposably irrefragable barriers of 
mathematical analysis? Poring over the huge 
folios of Laplace, might he not repose in safety, 
walled in by thorny hedges of mathematical 
symbols ? Yet even here repose was not to be 
found, nor freedom from the distraction of 
novel ideas. The "apioid" of Poincaie, the 
tidal researches of Darwin and others, the novel 
speculations of Chamberlin and Moulton as to 
the possible origin of the solar system, all these 
and other things have jostled the staid old 
nebular hypothesis in very unseemly fashion. 

One stronghold, however, has been left to 
which the much-perplexed astronomer might 
flee. He might at least take refuge in the 
placid and unchanging face of the moon, 
which, bereft of water and air, has maintained 
its surface features sharp, clear, and unchang- 
ing, during the three centuries which have 
elapsed feince Galileo first descried the moun-

our Satellite, with a Complete Photographic Atlas. By

Page & Co. 



tains on its spotty globe. But even this refuge 
seems now to be taken away. For Professor 
Wm. H. Pickering, of Plarvard, has produced 
a sumptuous volume entitled " The Moon," in 
which he invests our satellite with an atmos- 
phere, supplies it with vestiges of vegetation, 
besprinkles portions of it with snow or hoar- 
frost, furnishes here and there a mildly active 
volcano, equips it with some minute canals and 
with river-beds, and thus quite demoralizes some 
of the standard notions as to the utter deadness 
of our pallid satellite. The average working 
astronomer, — who scarcely looks at the moon 
except when he has to entertain visitors by 
telescopic views of it, and who usually wishes 
that it were below the horizon whenever it is 
above, because its bright light overpowers that 
of many faint objects, which he is studying, — 
will find in this work not only Professor Pick- 
ering's conclusions, but the drawings and pho- 
tographs on which they are based. The book 
tells plainly where to look in order to verify 
the author's discoveries, and what one may ex- 
pect to see there. Someone has remarked that 
the men who are most confident that the face of 
the moon is changeless are those who do not 
study it. 

But the book was not intended for the en- 
lightenment of astronomers ; it was written for 
the general public, and aims especially to de- 
scribe contributions to our knowledge of the 
lunar surface which have been made by Pro- 
fessor Pickering as the result of several years 
of careful scrutiny of selected portions of it. 
The work also summarizes in pleasing fashion 
the generally accepted facts about our satel- 
lite, and is rendered unique by including the 
only complete photographic atlas of the moon 
in existence. 

The author begins his study of the moon at 
a point of time 50,000,000 years or more in 
the past, when it broke away from mother 
Earth and began to have a separate existence. 
Huge tides were raised on both of these plastic 
bodies, and their velocities of rotation were re- 
tarded. As the moon slowly backed away 
from the earth, and cooled off, it finally solidi- 
fied into a body not quite spherical but slightly 
elongated toward the earth. Its time of revo- 
lution about the parent body, and of rotation 
on its own axis, became coincident ; so that it 
henceforth presented the same face toward the 
earth. The crust cracked in the process of 
cooling, and the heated gases thus found vent, 
and craters were formed. Professor Pickering 
has made similar forms by heating a small dish 



234 



THE DIAli

containing paraffine, and permitting it to cool, 
agitating the crust from time to time by means 
of a syringe inserted below it. 

But what about the atmosphere which the 
moon carried away with it when it left the 
earth? It is known that the moon now has 
very little atmosphere, if any. The author 
thinks there is evidence of a small quantity of 
atmosphere, likely to be composed of carbonic 
acid and water vapor, — those gases being 
given off largely by volcanoes on the earth, 
and thus similarly by those on the moon. In 
the low temperatures which must exist on the 
moon's surface, especially on parts of it that 
are experiencing a lunar night, the water- 
vapor would condense into snow or hoar-frost ; 
while the carbonic acid would become a white 
solid, as it does in our laboratories when sud- 
denly released from compression. The mag- 
nificent system of rays radiating from the crater 
Tycho is explained as a set of crevices in which 
snow lies. The changes in the crater Linne, 
observed long ago and regarded as mysterious, 
are attributed to the existence and melting of 
snow in its immediate vicinity. 

Professor Pickering has for the past ten 
years observed certain variable spots which are 
dark and are '' always associated with small 
craterlets or deep narrow clefts, and are often 
symmetrically arranged around the former." 
These spots, in general, rapidly darken shortly 
after sunrise, and fade away with equal rapid- 
ity toward sunset. The author suggests that 
the simplest explanation of these is to regard 
them as due to a form of vegetation which 
springs up quickly under the combined influ- 
ence of the sun and the low-lying vapors, soon 
withers under the noon-day heat, and dies 
away again. 

One chapter of the work is devoted to popu- 
lar fancies and superstitions about the moon. 
A full-page plate shows some objects which 
people think that they see on the lunar disc, — 
among them a donkey, a crab, a girl reading a 
book, and the profile of a woman's head. The 
various theories that the moon influences the 
weather, clearing away clouds, indicating rain 
or its absence by the tipping of its horns, and 
having some connection between its phases and 
thunderstorms, are discussed and dismissed 
with the remark that no influence of any prac- 
tical importance has been shown. The appa- 
rent increase of size of the moon when near the 
horizon is considered at some length, and ex- 
plained in a reasonable fashion. 

The main portion of the photographic atlas 



with which the work closes consists of eighty 
full-page reproductions of photographic nega- 
tives, which occupy considerably more than a 
third of the book, and cover the entire visible 
surface of the moon five times. " Every re- 
gion is shown in five different phases, many 
details being conspicuous at one phase of the 
Moon that are not seen at all at another. In 
this way, changes in the snow-patches and in 
the vegetation are shown which could not pos- 
sibly be indicated by any single photograph." 
The photographs were made on the island of 
Jamaica, with a telescope of novel dimensions, 
suited especially to such work. The telescope 
was no less than 135 feet long, and had an 
object-glass twelve inches in diameter. It was 
laid along the ground, and the light was re- 
flected into it by a mirror driven by electric 
motors. Because of the extreme length of the 
telescope, the moon's image on the photographic 
plate was over fifteen inches in diameter. It 
was therefore not necessary to enlarge the pho- 
tographs in order to get pictures on a goodly 
scale. Many recently published photographs 
of lunar scenery have been so much enlarged 
that the grain of the photographic plate shows ; 
Professor Pickering's pictures look much 
smoother and more natural than these. There 
are also four maps in which some five hundred 
craters and other formations are named, to- 
gether with an alphabetical index containing 
the latitudes and longitudes of these objects.

An Old-New Biography of LincoliN.* 

Not every writer of a campaign biography 
is as fortunate in his subject as was Mr. Joseph 
H. Barrett, to whom was assigned, in 1860 
the hack-work task of setting forth the achieve- 
ments of the candidate to be nominated by the 
Republican party that year, in such a way as 
to commend that candidate to the confidence 
and the suffrages of the voters of the North. 
It was then generally supposed that Senator 
Seward would be the man; and it would not 
have been hard to make a book on his record 
as a statesman. But as things turned out, Mr. 
Barrett's task was not an easy one ; for Abra- 
ham Lincoln had held no great office, his one 
term in Congress had been inconspicuous, and 
he was unknown in the Eastern States except

for his recent campaign speeches. The hard- 
headed opponents of slavery in those States 
believed that character and statesmanship had 
been set aside for expediency, culture for boor- 
ishness, when the " rail-splitter " was preferred 
to Seward and Chase. 

This campaign biography, though reissued 
in 1864 with additions, and again in 1865 with 
a third part, went the way of all campaign bio- 
graphies ; but the great character and qualities 
of the subject have held the interest of the 
writer, and now, after more than forty years, 
he gives to the public another biography, far 
more carefully worked out, — not this time of 
a frontier politician of unknown possibilities 
whom a great portion of his own party dis- 
trusted and for whom the opposing party felt 
only contempt and expressed only ridicule, but 
of one who has proved himself to be one of the 
great rulers of men, whom all classes and all 
parties delight to honor. 

Mr. Barrett was an editor in Cincinnati 
when he agreed to write the book, and was a 
member of the nominating convention at Chi- 
cago. Soon after it adjourned, he went to 
Springfield to get materials for his work. Mr. 
Lincoln "earnestly, and even sadly, insisted 
that' there was no adequate material for such 
a work as was intended," but gave such assist- 
ance as he could to the would-be biographer. 
Mr. Barrett was with him later in Springfield, 
and during a part of the memorable journey to 
Washington ; and he saw much of him during 
the next four years, having been made Com- 
missioner of Pensions. Since that time he has 
been steadily preparing this more deliberate 
and complete work, possible only as the pas- 
sions of the time have cooled and the period of 
the Civil War has passed into the field of set- 
tled history. 

The work is primarily a political history. 
The man Lincoln is largely obscured by the 
mass of historical and military detail of the 
years of his presidency ; yet he is shown, behind 
and in it all, as the master of the situation and 
the real directing power of the vast and com- 
plex activities of the war and the civil govern- 
ment, whom the strong men of his cabinet were 
glad to follow when once they had found what 
sort of man he was. In the early portion of 
the work, Lincoln is necessarily at the front ; 
and while no attempt has been made to gather 
a large number of new anecdotes and remin- 
iscences, as some recent writers have done, the 
presentation of Lincoln's formative period is 
satisfactory. Several of the familiar legends 



and traditions that have gathered about him 
are disposed of in a very satisfactory way. We 
find (page 56) that " he had no invincible ob- 
jection to a good client with a bad cause," 
having acted as counsel for a Kentuckian who 
sought to reclaim certain slaves that he had 
voluntarily brought into Illinois for temporary 
employment; though it is true that he was not 
often found in a case where he worked against 
his convictions of justice. The romantic fiction 
that Lincoln was so affected by the death of his 
early love, Ann Rutledge, as to be almost in- 
sane for a considerable period, is made to ap- 
pear unreasonable in view of several facts, 
among them that he offered himself to another 
woman within a year of Ann Rutledge's death, 
and that the alleged periods of depression were 
of too short duration, and not at the right 
times, to suit the theories. Equally baseless is 
Mr. Herndon's recollection of a snub received 
by Lincoln from George B. McClellan, then an 
officer of the Illinois Central Railway, who is 
said to have scouted Lincoln's claim for a fee 
of two thousand dollars in an important case, 
saying that it was as much as Daniel Webster 
would have charged ; whereupon Lincoln sued 
the company for five thousand dollars and won 
his case. The facts are as given, except that 
Mr. McClellan was in Europe at the time. It 
is usually said that Lincoln was appointed Gov- 
ernor of Oregon after he failed to get the 
office of Commissioner of the General Land 
Office, and that only Mrs. Lincoln's objections 
and her faith in his future kept him from ac- 
cepting the appointment. It is true that he 
was appointed to an office in Oregon, but it was 
the office of Secretary of the Territory, which 
he could not accept with due self-respect. 

The two volumes contain a little less than 
four hundred pages each. Eighty-three pages 
are given to Lincoln's life prior to his election 
to Congress. On page 123 we come to the 
" Nebraska Surprise "; twenty-five pages are 
given to an excellent account of the debates 
with Senator Douglas; and we find him nom- 
inated for the presidency on page 219. Three- 
fourths of the work are given to the five years 
of Lincoln's life on the national stage ; but, as 
we have said, this part of the work is a history 
of the time rather than a life of Lincoln, and 
it is too crowded to be as interesting or as val- 
uable as if less had been attempted. 

The view-point of Mr. Barrett is that of a 
sincere admirer, who finds little to criticize, 
though his praise is not lavish. He writes his 
history as a public man with a taste for the 



236

subject, and not as a trained historical student. 
The style is dignified, and the work will take 
its place on the library shelf as one of the 
worthy biographies of "the First American."

American Tariff Controversies.* 

Mr. Stanwood's two bulky volumes on 
" American Tarijff Controversies " comprehend 
the entire period of American tariff history. 
The beginnings of restrictive legislation, and 
the course of economic thought through the 
colonial period, are treated only cursorily ; but 
the general situation is outlined with a firm 
grasp of this history and of its bearing upon 
contemporary events. The restrictions which 
were placed upon the industrial and commercial 
activities of the colonies, in strict accord with 
the political economy of the time, but which 
could not be other than irksome, came at last 
to seem an intolerable grievance. The colonies 
were thus predisposed to the new economic 
thought which was stirring in Europe and 
which crystallized in the great work of Adam 
Smith. From the position thus reached there 
was a sharp reaction during the period of Con- 
federation, due in considerable measure to the 
failure to secure reciprocity arrangements with 
European powers. Considerations of revenue 
prompted the first tariff under the Constitu- 
tion ; but there was also the conviction, shared 
by the majority of the members of Congress, 
that without sacrificing revenue considerations 
a considerable encouragement could be and 
ought to be given to domestic manufactures. 

It is at this point that Mr. Stanwood's his- 
tory fairly begins. He has recorded the pro- 
gress of tariff legislation with all the significant 
changes in rates and with a painstaking resume 
of the events, and particularly of the course of 
reasoning, which led to each act of Congress. 
This task he has performed with thoroughness, 
with fidelity to the facts, and almost without 
bias. To the general student of politics, ac- 
customed to rely upon the so-called tariff his- 
tories of unscholarly partisans, or upon the 
still more biased statements from the hustings, 
these volumes will prove a welcome corrective 
and an indispensable handbook. Not so acute 
as Taussig, not wholly unconfused as to its in- 
cidental thesis, the work is yet admirably tem-

teenth Century. By Edward Stanwood. In two volumes.

pered, and covers the subject with a complete- 
ness to which no other existing tariff history 
can pretend. 

Mr. Stanwood has chosen to write of tariff 
controversies rather than of tariff history. 
This, as he conceives it, allows him to escape 
from the necessity of a critical analysis of the 
theories of free-trade and protection, from " any 
discussion of the theory of wages, of the wisdom 
of buying in the cheapest market, and of other 
philosophical ideas upon which men have based 
their conclusions as to the economic effects of 
tariffs." He concedes the limitations which 
this restricted point of view will put upon his 
work. What he will modestly attempt is to so 
exhibit the controversial side of this tariff 
history, setting forth in due measure and due 
relief the opposing arguments, that every 
reader, whatever his bias, will have at hand the 
material for forming his own judgment. Of 
course the resulting judgment will be valuable 
only so far as it is based upon sound economic 
analysis. Tariff controversies and tariff 
changes, without interpretation, would be profit- 
less reading. And it is the author's interpre- 
tation, which he evades only fitfully, that must 
assign the final value to his work. 

The author's tariff convictions are frankly 
stated at the outset : " The work is confessedly 
that of one who believes that the system of 
protection has given an opportunity which the 
opposing system would not have afforded for 
the unexampled growth of the country." And 
at the end it is still "a policy under which the 
land has moved into the front rank of commer- 
cial as well as of manufacturing nations." This 
is mild indeed for an advocate, but Mr. Stan- 
wood makes up for his mildness by his persist- 
ence. His is not the championship of one who, 
long balancing the conflicting claims of two op- 
posing systems, finally comes to the conclusion 
that on the whole the advantage lies with the 
one system rather than the other. His advo- 
cacy is uncompromising and absolutely opti- 
mistic. He recognizes the exaggerated and 
contradictory claims which have been made for 
his cause ; he never hesitates to lay bare their 
fallacies. He will even say that " a protective 
tariff is of little benefit to the country, to man- 
ufacturers, or to wage-earners, in those periods 
when trade is expanding and when prices are 
steady at a high level or advancing " (Vol. II., 
p. 111). But he is so calmly sure that the 
country has prospered under protection, that 
every protective tariff, no matter how it came 
about or what vicious features were included in 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



237 



it, seems to justify itself. The tariff of 1864, 
he points out, is full of examples of the prowess 
of the protected manufacturers (Vol. II., p. 
129). The framers of the McKinley act very 
deliberately set out to win over the disaffected 
farmers by covering their industries with the 
protective mantle, the purpose being purely 
political (Vol. II., pp. 264, 266). None of the 
political raanoeuvering constantly mixed up 
with tariff legislation is concealed by Mr. Stan- 
wood, but his complacency is never disturbed. 
The story of the first political tariff, that of 
1828, is given in detail with all the discordant 
and unsavory elements which went into its 
making. Passed by a Congress really hostile 
to protection, in a kind of boisterously mad 
attempt to make a bill so extreme and farcical 
that it could be stomached by nobody, in its 
working out it proved unexpectedly satisfactory 
to most of the protected interests. According 
to Mr. Stanwood, its success was so great that 
a vast majority of the people were convinced 
that it was the chief agent in dispelling the 
clouds and permitting the sunshine of pros- 
perity to vivify the land (Vol. I., p. 357). 
Yet he also holds that the acts of 1832 and 
1833 were designed (and were necessary) to 
save the protective system from destruction. 
Clay's position on the Compromise of 1833 is 
stoutly defended : " Undoubtedly he saved his 
cause from a crushing and overwhelming 
defeat." Political sagacity required such a 
sacrifice. " The system would surely have been 
swept away within a year or two if some of its 
adherents had not foreseen what was to hap- 
pen and taken security of the future" (Vol. 
I., pp. 385, 402, 410). 

Mr. Stanwood is severe upon Secretary 
Walker's Report, because of its advocacy of a 
larger importation of foreign goods. But it is 
Mr. Stanwood's own contention that " a high 
tariff for purposes of protection is not levied 
necessarily with a view to causing a diminu- 
tion of imports, does not necessarily diminish 
them, and does not invariably fail of its pur- 
pose when it does not diminish them" (Vol. 
I., p. 252); and he notes with evident satis- 
faction the steady increase in the importation 
of protected articles under the tariff of 1842 — 
the protective tariff which immediately pre- 
ceded the Walker Report. He accounts for 
the fairly prosperous condition of the country 
under the Walker tariff by the great flow of 
gold from California. He holds that the 
Walker tariff (as well as the final stage of the 
Compromise tariff) practically ruined the 



woollen industry ; but evidently his usual cau- 
tiousness of statement has deserted him here. 

The setting forth of the course of tariff his- 
tory, by an analysis of how problems were 
stated and what arguments were used pro and 
con, shows to best advantage in early tariff 
history. Eighteen pages of text are devoted 
to a summary of the course of debate on the 
tariff of 1789. " In this summary," the author 
believes, " will be found every expression con- 
tained in any record of the debates extant, 
which will assist in arriving at the truth." The 
summary is carefully done, yet it is doubtful 
if the clue to its meaning is furnished. For 
example, the dominating influence of Madison 
is not brought out ; and instead of making the 
debate itself dispose of Professor Adams's 
hasty inference against the protective features 
of the act, Mr. Stanwood finds a labored argu- 
ment necessary. 

The tariff of 1816 was passed " premature- 
ly." Mr. Stanwood has reference, of course, 
to the fact that, in operation, owing partly to 
conditions which could not have been foreseen, 
the act proved disappointing both from the 
revenue and the protective points of view. The 
distinction of this tariff, however, is that it is 
the one act in our tariff history in which all 
sections of the Union joined in a sincere at- 
tempt to give adequate protection to American 
manufactures. The failure of this attempt 
marks the disappearance of the tariff as an 
economic question. Not that academic discus- 
sion ceased ; but between the years 1816-1828 
was perfected that thorough organization of the 
protected interests through which their de- 
mands have been made and their battles fought 
out in Congress. It was during this period also 
that the sectional aspec); of the question became 
undisguised. As the economic aspect receded, 
tariffs and tariff legislation came to be more 
and more considered from the point of view of 
party politics. Yet the volume of discussion 
swells ever larger and larger, and is more and 
more given in extenso in Congressional records. 
Mr. Stanwood struggles bravely through these 
interminable discussions, finding little that is 
new, and occasionally with only strength 
enough left to count the pages. He gives an 
elaborate analysis and resume of the industrial 
conditions, depressions, and changes of the last 
quarter of the nineteenth century, claiming for 
the protective tariff an important role, but only 
as a steadying force enabling industry to come 
safely through very distressing times.

ing that period, one may fairly maintain that the im- 
portance of the tarifE was grossly exaggerated by the 
disputants on both sides. Although we were to concede 
without qualification the point contended for by the 
advocates of free trade, that the only effect of pro- 
tection upon the wage-earner was unmitigated evil, the 
results of the great industrial commotion that was going 
on were of such magnitude that the consequences of the 
tariff would be quite imperceptible. On the manu- 
facturer's side, the same disturbances were causing him 
so much anxiety that the maintenance of the protective 
system merely saved him from one peril which might 
have been the fatal peril only because he was already 
so harassed on every side. The free-trader did not 
perceive, nor did the workingman, nor did the manu- 
facturer, that the lot of each was to be greatly ameli- 
orated by events which while they were in progress 
caused them all infinite discomfort, and which seemed 
to threaten every one of them with ruin " (II., 245). 

Out of that depression the country emerged 
into a remarkable era of expansion at home 
and conquest of the markets of the world. 
Some idea of the relative unimportance of 
tariffs, in this new industrial situation, is im- 
pressed upon all but the most blinded partisan 
of either side. The great desideratum in 
tariff-making is an understanding of the pre- 
cise part which may be assigned to such leg- 
islation among all the complex forces and sit- 
uations that go to bring about industrial 
supremacy, or whatever object the legislator 
may legitimately have in mind. To this end, 
it is necessary that mere party politics play as 
little part as possible. Mr. Stanwood has 
failed many times to point out how political 
tariffs have outraged a just sense of what is 
legitimate and proper, and his dramatization 
of tariff history does not bear out very strongly 
his own thesis. The temper in which he has 
written, however, is admirably calculated to 
help toward a better understanding of the 
problem and how it ought to be approached. 
In the task of getting this problem seriously 
before our lawmakers in its economico-national 
aspect, Mr. Stanwood's work ought to prove 
extremely useful. Q. L. Elliott. 



An American Mushroom Book.* 

Of the progress in natural history study in 
this country, and of the thoroughly practical 
nature of our scientific work. Professor Atkin- 
son's book on Mushrooms is the latest evidence. 
Twenty-five years ago, not only was there not 
an American book on Mushrooms in existence, 
but the student of Fungi even found in En-

Francis Atkinson. Second edition. Illustrated. New York :

glish only the scantiest literature, — a single 
volume by Berkeley, and a list published here 
or there by some one of his pupils. To-day 
the cryptogamic flora of every State is studied 
perhaps only less universally than the flower- 
ing plants, and certainly with equal accuracy 
and zeal. 

The Fungi, however, have come last to the 
attention of the general public. The reasons for 
this are many. In the first place, these forma 
of vegetation are often inconspicuous; men do 
not notice their existence. In the second place^ 
many of these plants are insignificant ; they 
seem to play a small part, or none, in the general 
economy of the world. A deeper reason than 
all this is perhaps to be found in the nature of 
the plants themselves : they are " off color " I 
While all other plants with which we are fami- 
liar bear in their coloring the evidence of vig- 
orous life, the Fungi, even in their most con- 
spicious types, are pale livid- looking things, 
suggestive of anything but life, — nay, even 
associated with decay and death. Hence it is 
that, in this country at least, when men see a 
fungus, the first and only impulse is to kick it. 
to pieces. 

Nevertheless, in Europe, centuries ago, mei> 
somehow learned that some fungi are good 
to eat. It must have been in a time of un- 
common destitution that some poor emaciated 
starveling, bolder than his fellows, ventured ta 
sate his famine with mushrooms, and so saved 
his life to tell his secret unto others, — imper- 
fectly no doubt, for with most men the rule haa 
run to eat the thing, and it will be proved ta 
be good if you live, poisonous if you die ! Pro- 
fessor Atkinson's book is intended to teach 
good Americans how to distinguish good fungi 
from bad by some rule less hazardous in appli- 
cation, even if withal less positive in its deci- 
sions. The great American public has indeed 
proceeded to classify the larger umbrella-like 
fungi into two divisions, toadstools and mush- 
rooms. On this proposition, mushrooms are 
good to eat, toadstools are not; but the afore- 
said public cannot even now distinguish save 
by the ancient rule, and any book that will 
help us in this particular will be welcome 
indeed. It is fashionable to eat mushrooms. 

Unfortunately, there is no short road to the 
knowledge that we seek. The volume before 
us, with its clear illustrations, vivid as light, 
can make them, is obvious evidence of the 
truth that to select edible from inedible forms, 
of mushrooms we must learn to know these 
things as we do others; to distinguish one

from the other by details of form, color, hab- 
itat, habit, as we distinguish buckeyes from 
chestnuts, plums from persimmons, grapes from 
brambles, and figs from thistles. Such attain- 
ment will come to those only who have the pa- 
tience to study mushrooms in the field ; and to 
such study this book will be of the highest 
service. These pale or sometimes snow-white 
objects lend themselves well to photographic art, 
and with a little care almost any mushroom 
plant may be identified by simple comparison 
with its photograph shown on these pages. 
With the added description, identification 
ought to be at length absolute. For the more 
distinctly colored forms, colored plates of more 
or less accuracy are also offered. 

A surprising number of species is offered as 
"edible." It is a matter of regret that the 
leading genus of white-spored agarics (a bet- 
ter general name than either mushrooms or 
toadstools), the genus Amanita, should not be 
more decidedly condemned. The species are 
poisonous as a rule and the phrase "edible, 
with great caution " is ill-advised. The factor 
of safety would suggest that all such forms be 
put down as inedible. It is also a truism that 
many forms not poisonous are still inedible, 
simply because they are not good to eat. One 
of the commonest forms in our western fields, 
Lepiota morgani Pk., here quoted as uncer- 
tain, is surely poisonous in the extreme. It 
may be known by its having the gills at length 
green, a character unique among agarics. 

To this second edition of a very valuable 
book are added chapters on the uses and cul- 
tivation of the real mushrooms, and some ten 
or twelve colored plates. The volume is a 
handsome one ; the paper is, however, of the 
highly calendered variety, a necessity to the 
printing of these abundant half-tones.

A budget of 
entertaining 
anecdote*. 



'^ Personalia : iDtimate Recollections 
of Famous Men " ( Doubleday, Page 
& Co.), by "Sigma," is well cal- 
culated to beguile an idle hour or two, and the 
author is to be thanked for several new and good 
stories. Other anecdotes in his book are either 
familiar to the well-read or are novel only in the 
matter of scene and actors. This is not said in 
disparagement. The good story is a plant of so 
hardy and vigorous a constitution that it will take 
root and thrive in almost any soil. A witty word 
from Oacar Wilde is worth quoting. A tiresome 



poetaster, complaining that the critics seemed to 
have entered into a conspiracy of silence against 
him, asked Wilde what he would advise him to do. 
"Join it," was the reply. "Sigma" shows himself 
to be a loyal Harrovian, and as such an ardent ad- 
mirer of Palmerston, also a Harrow graduate. A 
tendency to depreciate Gladstone results perhaps 
from this worship of " Pam." In art and poetry 
the author extols the pre-Raphaelites and glows 
with enthusiasm for Rossetti and Swinburne. In 
the field of fiction he thinks Thackeray has received 
rather more than his due of praise, he himself in- 
clining to rate Trollope above Thackeray except in 
the latter's very best work. A discussion of the 
authorship of the Junius Letters betrays a lack of 
penetration. Basing his case on certain passages 
in Lady Anne Hamilton's " Secret History of the 
Court of England," our author makes what seems 
at first a plausible if not convincing argument in 
support of the Rev. James Wilmot's authorship of 
the Letters. But he ignores the fact that Lady 
Hamilton dieclaimed responsibility for the " Secret 
History," which is now regarded as the work, 
wholly or in part, of Mrs. Olivia (Wilmot) Serres, 
whose life was a series of notorious impostures, 
the chief of which was her masquerading as Prin- 
cess Olive of Cumberland and niece of George the 
Third. In a word, the careful student of the Junius 
mystery will find little that is either new or true in 
this attempt to settle the vexed question. This, 
however, is merely by the way, and must not be 
allowed to prejudice the reader against a book that 
makes no claim to rigorous historical accuracy or 
to critical acumen. 



A treasury of 
EnglUh literature. 



With the publication of the third vol- 
ume, the new edition of "Chambers's 
Cyclopaedia of English Literature,'* 
edited by Dr. David Patrick, is now complete. The 
Messrs. Lippincott are the American publishers of 
this work, and have copyrighted no less than fifty 
special articles among its contents, which should 
prove an effective protection against piracy. These 
special articles constitute the feature of chief inter- 
est in the present volume. There have been special 
articles in the other volumes, but not in so large a 
number, or with such actuality of interest. In the 
present case, almost every important nineteenth- 
century author has been entrusted to some specialist, 
who has written the essay and made the illustrative 
selections. Thus we find such noteworthy features 
as the treatment of Wordsworth and Scott by 
Professor Ker, of Shelley by Mr. Swinburne, of 
Byron and Borrow by Mr. Watts-Dunton, of Carlyle 
by Dr. Wallace, of Ruskin by Mr. Mackail, of 
Arnold by Professor Dowden, of the Rossettis and 
Stevenson by Professor Raleigh, of Messrs. Watts- 
Dunton and Swinburne by Mr. James Douglas. The 
American articles are mostly by Mr. J. W. Chad- 
wick, although a few are contributed by Professor 
Woodberry, President Schurman, and others. Be- 
sides all these, and many more of nearly equal

importance, there is an introductory esBay on " The 
Renascence of Wonder in Poetry," by Mr. Watts- 
Dunton, a work of sach extraordinary grasp and 
insight as to be comparable only with that writer's 
essay on " Poetry " in the " Britannica." These two 
essays are alone sufficient to mark their author as 
the profoundest and best-equipped critic of poetry 
now living, and serve to deepen our regret that the 
greater part of his critical writing remains uncol- 
lected and inaccessible to the ordinary student. 
Now that this great work is complete, it is possible 
to form some estimate of it as a whole, and that 
estimate is highly to the credit of the editors, who 
have done their task with a thoroughness and a 
judicial poise that leave almost nothing to be de- 
sired. We may indeed congratulate ourselves that 
the same year has put us in possession of the two 
most important treasuries of English literature ever 
published — the work now under consideration, and 
the recently-completed work of Drs. Garnett and 
Gosse. 

The meaning ^ curious and interesting study of 

and origin the meaning of myth and folk-lore 

of folk-lore. jg contained in the Rev. Adolph 

Roeders "Symbol Psychology" (Harper), whose 
sub-title, '* A New Interpretation of Race-Tradi- 
tions," is a more lucid statement of the book's con- 
tents. Of the various explanations advanced by 
anthropologists to account for the origin of myth, 
the author selects one, — the wish of the savage 
wherever found to account for the world he lives 
in, — and one limited and sophisticated form of 
that ; namely, his attempt to symbolize in story the 
facts of his spiritual experience. Proceeding on 
this theory, which few readers will probably care 
to accept as a working hypothesis, since it neglects 
many elements of a complex situation, and attributes 
to the savage impulses that imply civilization, Mr. 
Roeder chooses a cycle of familiar tales common to 
many races and attempts to explain them on purely 
symbolic lines. For example, there is the Twin 
Brother Story, whose characters appear variously 
as Romulus and Remus, Baldur and Hodur, Castor 
and Pollux, Hengist and Horsa, Cain and Abel. 
In this tale, according to our author, the race " has 
either consciously or sub-consciously [but is not the 
whole question begged in the use of this word?] 
faced a general problem," that of the duality of 
human experience ; and has sought to show that 
everywhere a constant struggle is going on be- 
tween two discordant elements — heat and cold, 
light and darkness, rest and motion, body and 
spirit, good and evil. Again, the captive maiden, 
so common a figure in the folk-tale, is made to sym- 
bolize the latent possibilities of humanity, dormant 
but ready to spring into life at the opportune mo- 
ment. Mr. Roeder's premise that myth is a stage 
in the evolution of religion will find few disputants 
to-day. But an hypothesis that assumes all myth 
to be essentially allegorical, and capable, further, of 
a specific spiritual interpretation, may be reduced 



to an absurdity quite as easily as that other favorite 
and over-burdened theory of the solar myth. The 
novelty of the present work consists in the partic- 
ular interpretations proposed for the folk-stories. 
These are sufficiently ingenious and suggestive to 
claim the attention of anthropologists and students 
of comparative religion, who have already had the 
opportunity of reading one chapter of the book, 
when it recently appeared as a separate essay in the 
periodical " Mind." 

The sixth and latest volume of the 
Anvsonociast u Modern English Writers" series 

on Thackeray. ,^ ,, ^, ,° „ ^ , . , ■., 

(Dodd, Mead & Co.) is by Mr. 
Charles Whibley, on Thackeray. The author of 
"Pendennis" has rarely been subjected to such 
searching, we might almost say scorching, analysis. 
The intrusion of the author " gives certain passages 
in ' Vanity Fair ' a rakish, almost a battered, air." 
Half of "The Newcomes" is "irrelevant." "The 
Virginians" is "a thing of patches, not an organic 
whole." " The Adventures of Philip " is the mere 
repeated work of a fatigued writer. Mr. Whibley 
evidently has no illusions about Thackeray, and is 
no hero-worshipper. Certainly his judgments are 
far enough from tallying with those of the public, — 
else Thackeray had long ago become as dusty a 
library classic as Lever, or Peacock, or Beacons- 
field. As it is, his works have gone through edition 
after edition ; bibliographers are still on the hunt 
for every scrap he ever wrote ; and he has taken 
his rightful place as one of the two greatest En- 
glish novelists of the nineteenth century. Why is 
this ? Mr. Whibley has not succeeded in telling 
us. Is it because he is temperamentally unsuited 
to be the biographer of Thackeray ? It is doubt- 
less true that Thackeray wrote many mediocre 
pieces ; and as he was a journalist, his practice- 
work, instead of reaching the oblivion of the waste- 
basket, found its way into print. But even his 
masterpieces seem not to have awakened much en- 
thusiasm in the breast of Mr. Whibley ; and faint 
praise too often gives a wrong impression. Of 
Thackeray's large and deep human sympathy, which 
expressed itself in a thousand ways in his writ- 
ings and in his life, we find all too little said. The 
book has been carelessly printed (or written) : wit- 
ness p. 27, "it must e'en have been composed," 
etc.; p. 88, "for Thackeray, although he might, 
and he chose, have studied," etc. ; p. 237, " neither 
Dickens nor Bulwer . . . give you a sense of liter- 
ary allusion." Thackeray's verse, too, deserves 
more recognition than it receives here. Yet Mr. 
Whibley is often right, and his book should not be 
neglected by students of Thackeray. 

Natural history, when written by a 
specialist, may be dry as dust to the 
reader who seeks not facts but enter- 
tainment. It may, however, be made both enter- 
taining and attractive as well as technically correct 
and free from unwarranted inferences and conclu-

sions. This has been admirably accomplished in a 
volume of zo5logical essays entitled " Mostly Mam- 
mals " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), by Professor R. Ly- 
dekker. These essays have been collected from 
various scientific and popular English periodicals, 
and are issued in handsome book form with illus- 
trations. While the variety of subjects detracts 
from any connected treatment, there nevertheless 
runs through most of the essays a thread of 
discussion of the relation of mammals to their 
environment. The significance of the coloration 
of the larger mammals, of the spots on the giraffe 
and the stripes on the tiger, the causes of the light 
colors of the Arctic animals and the pale tints of 
the inhabitants of the desert, are discussed with a 
wide range of pertinent facts in the light of cur- 
rent theories. An excellent photograph of East 
African giraffes " in covert " affords a graphic illus- 
tration of the similarity of their coloration to the 
effect produced by the light and shade in low shrub- 
bery. Considerable attention is also given to the 
past history of mammals as revealed by fossil re- 
mains, and to the origin of domesticated races, — 
for example, to the pedigree of the cat and the dog. 
The geographical distribution of existing mammals 
is incidentally treated in several essays that touch 
upon unique illustrations of the principles which 
have controlled this in the past, and instances are 
cited of the extinction of large animals within his- 
toric times and the causes of the destruction are 
related where they are known. The essays exhibit 
a wide range of learning and technical knowledge, 
and a keen appreciation of those phases of the 
science which are of popular interest and bear upon 
scientific problems of broad import. No living 
zoologist is better informed than the author, upon 
the subjects with which he is dealing ; the book is 
therefore both interesting and authoritative, and a 
model of high-grade natural history from the scien- 
tific rather than the literary or dramatic point of 
view which dominates so much of the recent litera- 
ture in this field. 

studiet of P^'of- George H. Palmer, of Har- 

eonductand vard University, is a wise guide to 

of character. ^^^ philosophic study of conduct and 

the forces that serve to upbuild character. His 
recent volume on " The Field of Ethics " was an 
introduction to the study of conduct, defining the 
field and pointing out the moral problems that lie 
within its bounds. His later work on "The Na- 
ture of Goodness" (Houghton) takes up and grap- 
ples with those problems themselves, establishing 
the real nature of goodness. The author's method 
is that adopted in his popular philosophical lectures. 
He begins with the simplest form of the problem, 
and advances by easy but definite steps into the 
more complicated phases of the question. The good- 
ness of persons is sharply discriminated from the 
goodness of things. These differences, according 
to Professor Palmer, are four, to each of which a 
special chapter is devoted. These four character- 



istics of persons are ability of self-consciousness, 
self-direction, self-development, and self-sacrifice. 
Each one of these chapters is a lucid, untechnical, 
entertaining, and very instructive exposition of 
ethical matters that should interest every student 
of self or of conduct in general. The last two 
chapters of the book are a gathering-up of the pre- 
ceding discussions, in such a manner as to crystal- 
lize the thought of the whole. The author's lan- 
guage and method of procedure show him to be a 
master of the art of teaching and of leading the 
thinking of his auditors, and that in a way most 
helpful in the building up and establishing of 

character. 

It is always difficult to summarize 
Recent advances j.jjg general contributions of modern 
periods of development to the ad- 
vance of learning. The difficulty is that we are 
too near to estimate them in their proper perspec- 
tive, and occasionally too much out of sympathy 
with the older culture to appreciate the part it has 
played in making way for the new. In Psychol- 
ogy this is particularly true, — so much so, that 
some have believed that the pathway of recent Psy- 
chology has been revolutionary rather than evolu- 
tionary. From an Italian source we have the 
most comprehensive of recent attempts to take the 
measure of modern Psychology. Professor Villa of 
the University of Rome has put forward a volume 
which well merits the honor, now accorded it, of an 
English translation, "Contemporary Psychology" 
(Macmillan). The translation itself is adequate, 
and presents to English readers a variety of chap- 
ters of special interest to them. Students will 
differ much in their estimate of what should and 
should not be contained within such a survey. But 
Professor Villa's arrangement of chapters, and his 
general presentation, although somewhat unsatis- 
factory and certainly diffuse, yet shows clearly 
some of the more important of recent advances in 
Psychology. The purposes which the book will 
best serve will be to introduce the general student 
and lay reader to the historical setting of the last 
century that forms the background to recent ad- 
vances in Psychology. For this limited but im- 
portant function, the manner and matter are both 

well suited. 

With the present general interest in 
all that relates to the labor question, 
the title of Mr. George L. Bolen's 
latest work, "Getting a Living" (Macmillan), is 
likely to attract popular attention. And it would 
seem, by the author's simplicity of style and sparse- 
ness of technical terms, that he intended his book 
for the reading public as well as for economists. 
Those who read the work will receive not only a 
fair comprehension of " the problem of wealth and 
poverty — of profits, wages, and trades-unionism " 
(as the sub-title runs), but they will also get the 
point of view of a man of varied experience as an 
employee and employer in different parts of the

coantry. The critic might complain that the argu- 
ments against profit-sharing are weak, or he might 
take issue with the author's opinions on some prob- 
lems involved in trades-unionism ; he would almost 
certainly consider Mr. Bolen's treatment of social- 
ism vindictive rather than scholarly ; and he would 
find such a phrase as '' There is no wealth but life " 
an anachronism in a book on economics. But at 
the same time he would have to concede that Mr. 
Bolen, following in a measure the English classical 
school, has been unusually successful in his expo- 
sition of rent, wages, and profits. Showing himself 
conversant with the current opinions and relations 
of capitalists and labor leaders, Mr. Bolen gives 
his readers a broad view of the present situation. 
He makes a splendid plea for self-dependence (aside 
from his attack on socialism), concluding that ''to 
a large extent, nature has decreed that each tub 
must stand on its own bottom." The present in- 
dividualistic system of getting a living will survive, 
for " no easier means than the present system im- 
proved can ever be expected, and that with no easier 
means could there be a continuance unimpaired of 
intelligence, morality, and liberty." The combina- 
tion of fair-mindedness and optimism, which char- 
acterizes the book, makes its moral tone high and 
invigorating. 

An introduction ^^of. William Cranston Lawton'g

Latin literature. Literature," just published by the 
Messrs. Scribner, is a companion volume to the 
author's " Greek Literature " of last year, and has 
the same characteristics of vivacity, wide allusive- 
ness, varied fragmentary illustration, and generally 
excellent judgment. The work produces a general 
impression of scrappines?, which is not so much a 
fault as an inevitable consequence of its terse and 
almost epigrammatic form of expression. Like Mr. 
Lawton's other histories of literature, it is a pleas- 
ant book to read, for one already having a fair ac- 
quaintance with its subject. We are not quite so 
sure of its usefulness for teaching purposes, or for 
the instruction of the average vacant-minded gen- 
eral reader. In the hands of a beginner, it would 
probably need too much commentary. The picto- 
rial illustrations are mostly from statues, paintings, 
and manuscripts ; the bibliographical notes ap- 
pended to the several chapters are brief, but in- 
formed and fairly adequate. 



Btginnings of the 
Cabinet Systom 
in England, 



Britain receives its full share of at- 
tention in the "Story of the Na- 
tions" series (Putnam). "Early 
Britain," "The British Empire," and "The People 
of England" are titles given to three of the vol- 
umes of the series that have already appeared ; and 
now we have the last of the list of titles, and pre- 
sumably the last volume of the series, "Parlia- 
mentary England: The Evolution of the Cabinet 
System," by Mr. Edward Jenks, M.A., Reader in 
Law in the University of Oxford. It might be 



questioned whether monarchical government limited 
by parliament, and government through cabinet, 
are precisely the same thing. Certainly one would 
expect the history of Parliamentary England to go 
back to the time of Edward I., or at least to that of 
Henry III. ; yet the author, in his interesting dis- 
cussion of the beginnings of the Cabinet System, 
regards the year 1705 as having far greater claims 
to be considered the exact date than any that pre- 
ceded it, and clearly regards the system as fully 
developed at the time of the passage of the Reform 
Bill in 1832. It is no criticism of his work to say 
that it begins with an abruptness that would seem 
to indicate that it was a portion of a more extended 
political history of England. But whether correctly 
named or not, and whether or not the volume prop- 
erly belongs in a series which purports to present 
" in story form the current of each nation's life . . . 
and its picturesque and noteworthy periods and 
episodes ... in their philosophical relation to each 
other as well as to universal history," this study of 
the development of the Cabinet System is a val- 
uable contribution to the history of English politics. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A new library edition of Macaulay's " Critical and 
Historical Essays," in three volumes, edited by Profes- 
sor F. C. Montague, is published by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. The editor provides an important 
introduction, and supplies annotations where needed. 
This work appears in a new "Library of Standard 
Literature," published in connection with an English 
house, and intended to extend to many volumes. 

A volume of " Tales of Mystery," by Edgar Allan 
Poe, has just been added by Mr. Howard Wilford Bell 
to the " Unit Library." There are five hundred pages 
of text, clearly-printed upon soft paper of particularly 
pleasing quality, and including a biography and notes. 
This is certainly good value for the modest sum of 
twenty-one cents, which is the price of the book un- 
bound. This series of publications is planned with both 
intelligence and taste, and the enterprise bids fair to 
become a boon to readers of modest means. The 
suggestion came from the Reclam library of German 
literature, but Mr. Bell has bettered the instruction at 
almost every point. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have begun the publica- 
tion of a " Belles-Lettres Series " of annotated English 
classics which will extend to several hundred volumes, 
and will cover the whole period of our literary produc- 
tion. The series is planned in several sections, each 
. under special editorship. The section on « The English 
Drama," edited by Professor George P. Baker, now 
offers us volumes of Jonson and Goldsmith, in evidence 
of the quality of the entire enterprise. The Jonson 
volume is edited by Professor Felix E. Schelling, and 
gives us "The Alchemist," besides the "Eastward 
Hoe" of composite authorship. The Goldsmith volume, 
edited by Mr. Austin Dobson, gives us " The Good 
Natur'd Man" and "She Stoops to Conquer." The 
books are squarish in form, have one illustration each, 
and are provided with the usual critical apparatus of 
introduction and notes. The texts are unexpurgated.

NOTBS. 



Mrs. Humphry Ward is now at work on the com- 
pletion of her new novel, which will follow Miss 
Johnston's " Sir Mortimer " as the leading serial in 
*' Harper's Magazine." 

" Mycen«an Troy," by Messrs. Herbert C. Tolman 
and Gilbert C. Seoggin, is a small volume based upon 
Dr. Dorpfeld's excavations at Hissarlik. It is published 
by the American Book Co. 

Professor C. H, C. Wright has prepared for the Mac- 
millan Co. an annotated volume of " Selections from 
Rabelais " for school use. Book I. alone is drawn upon 
for the material, and the text gives no offence. 

The late Sir Leslie Stephen left completed at his 
death his volume on Hobbes, and this will soon be pub- 
lished in the" English Men of Letters" series. So 
also will Mr. A. C. Benson's volume on Rossetti. 

"The Post-Exilic Prophets," by Dr. J. Wilson 
Harper, and " The Twelve Apostles," by Mr. George 
Milligan, are the latest additions to the " Temple 
Series of Bible Handbooks " published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. 

"State Aid to Secondary Schools," by Mr. David 
Rhys Jones, is a historical study of this important phase 
of American education, published in the series of edu- 
cational monographs recently inaugurated by the Uni- 
versity of California. 

A recent printing of " David Harum " brings the 
total number of copies issued of that novel up to 
778,000. Of this total, 600,000 copies, being the 
edition without illustrations, have been printed from 
a single set of plates. 

" The Song of Roland," translated by Miss Isabel 
Butler, and two books of Malory (Merlin and Balin), 
edited by Mr. Clarence Griffin Child, are new num- 
bers in the " Riverside Literature Series " of Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" Lord Acton's Letters to Mary Gladstone," to be 
published at once by the Macmillan Co., are said to 
throw many suggestive sidelights on the political and 
social world of Great Britain during the years when 
Gladstone was a power in English politics. 

Mr. Benjamin Ives Gilman, of the Boston Museum 
of Fine Arts, has prepared for that institution a " Man- 
ual of Italian Renaissance Sculpture," illustrated by the 
casts in the Boston collection. It makes a neat vol- 
ume, and has reference numbers for actual use. 

" The Conduct of Life " and " Society and Solitude " 
are the two volumes just added by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. to their " Centenary " edition of Emerson. 
Dr. E. W. Emerson's notes are, as usual, comprehen- 
sive and valuable for the understanding of the text. 

Among the speakers before the International Geo- 
graphical Congress to be held in Washington next Sep- 
tember will be Miss Ellen C. Semple, whose work on 
" American History and its Geographic Conditions," 
already in its second edition, has given her an enviable 
standing among scientific geographers. 

The first volume of the long-announced work on 
Geology by Professors Chamberlain and Salisbury, of 
the University of Chicago, will be issued at once by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The work is said to present 
convincingly a view of the origin of the earth and its 
present condition, which may lead to serious modifica- 
tions in the nebular hypothesis. 



Mrs. Perceval Mackrell has compiled a volume of 
"Hymns of the Christian Centuries," which is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The selec- 
tions range all the way from Clement of Alexandria to 
writers of recent years. The book is exquisitely printed. 

" How George Rogers Clark Won the Northwest, 
and Other Essays in Western History," by Mr. Reuben 
Gold Thwaites, is a recent publication of Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. There are eight papers, mostly of 
magSizme provenance, and written in a highly interesting 
manner. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. are about to publish 
"Specimens of Middle Scots," by Mr. G. Gregory 
Smith, of Balliol College, Oxford. In this volume 
Dr. Smith offers a general introduction to the study of 
the literary language of Scotland during its period of 
greatest renown. 

An edition of " The Poems of John Cleveland," by 
Dr. John M. Berdan, is published by the Grafton 
Press. This work is a revised doctoral dissertation, 
produced in ordinary book form, and constitutes the 
first complete critical edition ever made of this not 
unimportant seventeenth century poet. 

The fourteenth annual session of the Summer School 
of Library Economy, under the direction of Mr. Wm. 
I. Fletcher, will be held at Amherst, Mass., during 
July and August of this year. The course comprises 
six weeks of daily (except Saturday) instruction in the 
form of practical lectures by Mr, Fletcher. There are 
no special requirements for admission. 

The Spring list of the H. M. Caldwell Co. of Boston 
includes a volume on " The Legends of Parsifal " by 
Mary Hanford Ford; "The Peril of the Sword," a 
novel of the Indian Mutiny by Col. A. F. P. Harcourt; 
a collection of epigrams relating to " Woman and her 
Wits "; and a new edition of Dr. Francis C. Nicholas's 
" Around the Caribbean and Across Panama." 

Messrs, John Cotton Dana and Henry W. Kent have 
under way a project for issuing a series of six reprints 
of rare and out-of-print seventeenth and eighteenth 
century works on Libraries and their management, — 
such books as are the acknowledged early authorities 
on these subjects. The volumes will be printed in 
uniform style at the Merry mount Press, Boston. 

A volume of " Modern English Prose," selected by 
Professors George Rice Carpenter and William Tenney 
Brewster, is published by the Macmillan Co. This is 
an up-to-date book with a vengeance, for it gives us 
selections from Messrs. Hamlin Garland and Jack 
London in ridiculous juxtaposition with Gibbon, Ruskin, 
and Pater. A few pages of " notes and questions " at 
the end make clear the educational intent of the pub- 
lication. 

Two more of Dr. D. S. Jordan's stimulating and 
eloquent volumes have recently appeared. " The Voice 
of the Scholar," published by Messrs. Paul Elder & Co., 
contains fifteen occasional addresses, mostly upon edu- 
cational subjects, delivered during the past five years. 
The other volume, published by the American Unitarian 
Association, is attractively printed, with rubrications, 
and contains a single address on " The Call of the 
Twentieth Century." 

The publication of Daniel Webster's private corre- 
spondence in two volumes completes the set of the 
" New National " edition of the writings and speeches 
of Webster, which Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have 
been issuing for over a year. The eighteen octavo

volumes comprising the set embrace more than five 
hundred and fifty addresses and speeches, miscellane- 
ous and diplomatic papers, legal arguments, etc., and 
nearly eighteen hundred letters, including over 2,500 
pages of matter hitherto uncollected. The edition is 
illustrated with more than one hundred photogravure 
plates, and there are also several facsimiles from origi- 
nal manuscripts. The work is limited and sold only in 
sets by subscription. 

In addition to the unpublished matter that has 
already been promised for Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s 
edition of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the pub- 
lishers have secured some valuable and hitherto un- 
published material which is in the possession of Will- 
iam Clark. It includes several original note-books in 
which the Journal was written, and which have been 
hitherto missing, a number of letters of great interest, 
an orderly book of the expedition, and a large number 
of maps.

BOOKS OF PERMANENT VALUE 



IT is seldom that a publishing house can announce in one advertisement a selection of books of such 
undoubted merit as those listed below. Persons interested in marriage and divorce have long waited for 
a work like " Matrimonial Institutions " ; and this careful and complete treatise must at once become the 
authority in its field. " The Code of Hammurabi " sells rapidly among persons interested in ancient civiliza- 
tions. The "Lectures on Commerce" is proving a most useful manual; sales during the past month have 
nearly exhausted the first edition. The value of the " Constructive Bible Studies " for earnest and progressive 
Sunday school workers cannot be overestimated. The plan of study is clear and easily followed ; work along 
the lines suggested will surely bring g^tifying results. 



A History of Matrimonial 
Institutions 

By GEORGE E. HOWARD, Ph.D. 

3 vols., about 1500 pages, 8vo, $10.00, net. (In press.) 
This is the most complete work on the subject ever published. 
The author traces the development of matrimonial institu- 
tions from earliest times to the present day. He analyzes 
the successive legal aspects of marriage and divorce, also the 
influence of the institution upon social development. The 
material is nowhere else available and the book is indispen- 
sable to the student and the scholar. 

The Code of Hammurabi 

King of Babylon, about 2250 B. C. 

Edited by ROBERT F. HARPER, Ph.D. 

Large 8vo, 104 plates +208 pp. $4.00, net. 
These laws give us a very vivid picture of life in Babylonia 
more than four thousand years ago. It is the earliest Code 
now known. The growth of legal practices is curiously 
shown, in that there are survivals of tribal law, family law, 
and divine law in a Code that is preeminently sanctioned by 
royal decree and carries out only the royal wishes. Volume 
II., to be published later in the year, will consist of a care- 
ful comparison of this Code with that of Moses.

In this volume the Press presents a series of lectures deliv- 
ered at the University of Chicago by representative business 
men. The plan of the University in the College of Com- 
merce is to fit men for business and, with this end in view, successful business men were secured to deliver 
lectures upon subjects in which they were specialists. The first edition is nearly sold out, though on the 
market less than two months. Here is what the reviewers say : 

" The book contains an astonishing amount of information." — Chicago Journal. 

" We have no hesitation in commending this volume as a really valuable handbook." — The Outlook. 

" This is a book of unusual interest and great practical value. " — St. Paul Pioneer. 

" One of the most informing books ever put out by a university." — Chicago Daily News. 

" These papers make most interesting and instructive reading." — The Dial. 

" The volume is of special interest and will be found of practical value to railway men, economists, investors, and commercial 

educators." — The Railway Age. 
" Contains much of value to the young man seeking to improve his knowledge of the subjects treated. " — Pititburg Times. 
"This volume is of unusual interest, and the lectures are on subjects of value to economists, railroad men, investors, and 

commercial educators." — The Courier Journal (Louisville).

MYERS' ANCIENT HISTORY 

REVISED EDITION READY IN MAY 

For many years Myers' "Ancient History" has been used in by far the great majority of the schools of the 
country. To make this superior work still more adequate, the author has undertaken a thorough revision which 
involves many important changes in the text itself, in its arrangement, and in the appearance of the book. 

This edition is characterized by the following special features : 



The text embodies all the essential suggestions and 
recommendations contained in the Report of the 
Committee of Seven of the American Historical 
Association. 

The book meets adequately the entrance require- 
ments of the best colleges and universities. 
A brief resume of the history of the Oriental nations 
presents all the latest positive results of research in 
this field. 

The important intellectual and religious contribu- 
tion which the Alexandrian Age made to the civili- 
zation of later times is pointed out. 
The student is not allowed to lose sight of the con- 
nection between Greek and Roman history, — every 
point of contact between Greece and Italy being noted 
and the student aided by numerous cross references. 



6. In the Roman portion, special emphasis is laid upon 
the history of the Empire, as in the author's '* Rome: 
Its Rise and Fall." 

7. The narrative is brought down to the revival of the 
empire by Charlemagne in A. D. 800. 

8. Bibliographical and source references are given at 
the end of each chapter. 

9. The book is abundantly provided with maps and 
illustrations, the later being carefully chosen with 
reference to their authenticity and their value in 
illuminating the text. 

lo.No pains have been spared to make the language 
perfectly plain and simple and to bring everything 
to the level of the comprehension of beginners in 
history. 



In the mechanical execution of this book the publishers have made a special effort to raise the very high standard 
for which the volumes printed at the Athenaeum Press are noted. 

An illustrated announcement ivill be sent to any address on request.

THE ELECTI VE SC HOOL BOARD. 

The municipal election held this month in 
Chicago was comparatively unimportant as 
far as its character as an election proper was 
concerned, but was of great interest as an ex- 
pression of opinion upon certain questions of 
public policy that had been proposed to the 
voters. These questions mainly concerned the 
municipal ownership of the street railway sys- 
tem, and the result of the vote was a striking 
declaration in favor of the policy of public 



control. Unfortunately, an entirely different 
question — that of the elective city board of 
education — was proposed at the same time 
and under substantially the same auspices. 
The popular mandate on the subject of muni- 
cipal ownership thus carried with it, by force 
of attraction, a mandate in favor of an elective 
school board, very much as the party majority 
in a national election will usually carry with 
it a majority for the state and local candidates 
bearing the tag of the successful party. 

The vote upon the school question resulted 
approximately as follows : Of the total number 
of those who went to the polls, about one-fourth 
expressed no opinion at all upon this question ; 
the remaining three-fourths registered a vote 
of almost exactly two to one in favor of substi- 
tuting an elective for an appointive board of 
education. A majority for the policy was de- 
clared in every one of the city wards, although 
it is noticeable that the majority was only a 
small one in the wards that represent the more 
intelligent classes of citizenship, while it was 
largest in the wards that stand upon a lower 
plane in point of cultivation and political mor- 
ality. The vote on this question, moreover, 
had absolutely no legal force ; it was merely an 
expression of opinion — of ill-considered opin- 
ion — and an application of the principle of the 
initiative as permitted by the law of Illinois. 

We say advisedly that the vote was an 
expression of ill-considered opinion, for the 
subject had not been brought under serious 
discussion, and the decision went largely by 
default. It was the result of a sort of subter- 
ranean agitation carried on for several years 
past by peculiarly unscrupulous methods, and 
supported by all the devices of the demagogue. 
The proposition was opposed by the reput- 
able newspaper press of the city, but in so 
perfunctory a way, and with so imperfect a 
realization of its dangers, that there is no won- 
der, considering all the circumstances, that it 
should have received so large a vote. Attrac- 
tion, as we have already said, operated largely 
in its favor, and a sensational appeal to selfish 
interests did the rest. Thoughtful deliberation 
coupled with knowledge of the situation really 
had little to do with the matter ; prejudice on 
the one hand and apathy on the other were the

determining influences as far as the majority 
of the votes were concerned. 

Still, in spite of all these allowances, and in 
spite of the fact that no other power than the 
State Legislature can act effectively upon the 
Chicago school system, the thing is ominous, 
and those who care for the interests of the 
schools as distinguished from the interests of 
those who And them the means of a living 
must bestir themselves to see that the move- 
ment goes no further than this expression of 
opinion, pious or the reverse. From this time 
on there must be a serious campaign of edu- 
cation upon the subject of education, lest Chi- 
cago some day awake to find its school system 
bound hand and foot and given over to the 
tender mercies of the politician. What that 
would mean we know, or may know if we will, 
from the example of many other American 
cities, of Philadelphia, for instance, which oc- 
cupies a peculiarly bad eminence in this, as in 
other municipal matters. It has thus far been 
the pride of the Chicago schools that they have 
not been a part of the political system of the 
municipality. They have in the past been 
touched by politics, no doubt, but the infection 
has never spread very far, and the last few 
years have witnessed a notable degree of suc- 
cess in the elimination of political influences 
from their management, and in the establish- 
ment of methods in which merit and the inter- 
ests of education alone prevail. 

Of all times in the world, the present is the 
one in which a radical change would be most 
wanton and ill-advised. We might fill columns 
with the mere enumeration of the things that 
have been done of late to promote efficiency, 
to raise standards, to discourage attempts at 
"influence," and to give a healthful tone to 
the whole vast system. But it is no secret to 
those conversant with the situation that these 
salutary reforms have been the very main- 
spring of the agitation for a change that has 
at last so far achieved its purpose as to get the 
popular vote upon which we are now making 
comment. It is just because of these recent 
changes which have done so much to substitute 
desert for favor, and some measure of discrim- 
ination for the old wholesale methods of ap- 
pointment and promotion, that a considerable 
proportion of the teaching force has sought a 
way of escape from such irksome restraints, 
and has even resorted to an unholy alliance 
with the forces of labor unionism, thus endeav- 
oring to lower the noble profession of teaching 
to the level of a trade. The conditions now 



existing in the school system of Chicago are 
certainly such as to make a demand for elec- 
tive school authorities singularly ill-timed. 

It is a mistaken idea to suppose that democ- 
racy means the popular election of all officers 
who occupy important civic posts. What it 
really means is the election of as few officers 
as possible, and the concentration in their 
hands of the largest practicable powers of ap- 
pointment (subject to clearly-defined require- 
ments of fitness), in order that the responsi- 
bility for wrong-doing may be distinctly lodged 
where it belongs. Even as things now are, 
voters throughout the country are called upon 
to elect far too many officers, too many, that 
is, for a general exercise of intelligent judg- 
ment. Every attempt to increase this burden 
ought to be firmly resisted on general princi- 
ples. Particularly should it be resisted in the 
case of school officers, whose qualifications are 
of an expert nature, and no more to be deter- 
mined intelligently by average opinion or by a 
show of hands than the qualifications of libra- 
rians or physicians or engineers. Let it be 
granted that the appointing power sometimes 
makes mistakes, or is actuated by unworthy 
motives, yet how much greater must be the 
danger of these things when election by pop- 
ular vote is substituted for appointment. 

The simple fact is that an elective school 
board in a large city would mean a board 
made up of members who had sought the 
office. Now office-seeking is never dignified 
and is not often legitimate ; the last man or 
woman who should be entrusted with the duties 
of a school board member is one who would 
be willing to put himself in the position of 
appealing to popular suffrage for the office. 
We all know the noisy, self-advertising class 
of persons whose names would be found upon 
the ballot in such a case, and we all know how 
next to impossible it would be for a city in 
that manner to secure the services of members 
of a really desirable type. This is entirely 
aside from the merely political danger, in 
itself serious enough, and however ingeniously 
guarded against by such devices as large dis- 
tricts, special elections, and nominations by peti- 
tion, sure to make its presence felt in some insid- 
ious fashion. If it be urged that the objections 
above made apply also to the appointive method, 
it may be admitted that they do in some meas- 
ure; the question is one of degree rather than 
of kind, and the elective method seems to us 
to carry with it a far greater degree of danger. 
At all events, when the appointive system is

productive of such satisfactory results as have 
been witnessed in Chicago during the last few 
years, it would be the height of folly to attempt 
to supplant it by a system which is prima facie 
more susceptible to influences of a kind that 
should properly have nothing to do with the 
management of educational a£Pairs. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



IN RE SHAKESPEARE -BACON. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Some years ago there appeared in " Literature " a 
new and ingenious series of arguments which ought to 
have settled for all time the vexed question of the 
authorship of " Shakespeare." But we still find people 
stiffly defending the Stratford poacher's most absurd 
and baseless claims. Now I have a valuable addition 
to make to the line of proof adopted by Mr. Bucke (I 
think that was the writer's name), and I am convinced 
that the evidence I have to adduce will prove a clincher 
and will shut the mouths of all Shakespearians so tight 
that not another peep will ever be heard from them. 
Knowing that The Dial is widely circulated among 
intelligent and fair-minded readers, I have selected it 
as the most fitting medium for publishing this epoch- 
making discovery of mine. 

Mr. Bucke calls attention to the fact that almost 
every great author is commonly associated with the 
chief character he has created. Thus we link together 
Cervantes and Don Quixote, Le Sage and Gil Bias, 
Dickens and David Copperfield, George Eliot and 
Maggie TuUiver. Each of these characters stands in a 
measure for its author, representing him or his ideas 
with some degree of fidelity. What, now, is the chief, 
the best-known character in the so-called Shakespear- 
ian dramas? Hamlet, to be sure; and in the name 
lurks a very clever crypto-pun, — Ham [i. e., Bacon] 
let [or hindered from openly declaring his identity] So 
far, Mr. Bucke. But let us go a step further. What 
is Hamlet's most famous speech ? The immortal Solil- 
oquy. And the most familiar line therein ? The first. 
Let us examine this line. " Be " is phonetic for the 
second letter of the alphabet, and the line thus becomes 
" To B[acou] or not to B[acon are these plays to be 
ascribed], that is the question." And how is the ques- 
tion decided ? In the affirmative, of course. The so- 
liloquist determines against self-annihilation. The 
Baconian authorship is thus established. Note the 
foresight here displayed. With that prescience which 
belonged to the universality of his genius, Lord Bacon 
foresaw that this Soliloquy would be on every school- 
boy's tongue, and that its first line especially would be 
a household word. Hence the first line was chosen as 
the repository of his secret, the key and answer fol- 
lowing in the body of the speech. Could anything be 
plainer ? How easy it is to stand an egg on end as 
soon as you know how! 

If after this anyone has the hardihood to question 
Bacon's authorship of the so-called Shakespearian plays 
and poems, he must expect a speedy invitation to " go 
way back and sit down" with the believers in a flat 
world and a Ptolemaic astronomy.

A Great University President.* 

Dr. William Pepper's name is widely known as 
that of a man of prodigious energy and achieve- 
ment, not only in education and in the practice 
of medicine, but also in the promotion of count- 
less good causes having chiefly to do with his 
city and state. In his short life of fifty-four 
years he reorganized and recreated the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania, founded the University 
Hospital and various museums, as well as the 
Philadelphia Free Library, and effected the 
improvement of the city's water supply and a 
complete change in the local sentiment toward 
education and the higher ideals. In the course 
of this work he raised more than ten million 
dollars and secured about one hundred acres 
of land from the city, adding the personal 
gift of almost half a million dollars earned by 
him in the practice of an exacting profession. 
His most important achievements were those 
connected with the university that gave him 
both his academic and his professional educa- 
tion. In 1868, at the age of twenty-five, he 
began his lectures in the medical school, and 
continued them for thirty years. Succeeding 
Provost Stille as head of the University in 
1881, he at once set about raising the institu- 
tion from its comparative insignificance to a 
position of national importance, at the same 
time striving, not without success, to co-ordi- 
nate with it the educational systems of the city 
and state. He found the University a respect- 
able school ; he left it a real university. Seven- 
teen new departments were created by him, 
more than a score of costly buildings erected, 
the faculty was increased from ninety to near 
three hundred members, and the student body 
more than tripled. He raised four million 
dollars for endowment and other purposes, and 
added more than forty acres to the campus. 
All this, be it noted, was effected in a com- 
munity whose slowness and conservatism have 
passed into a proverb, and whose municipal 
corruption has of late attained unenviable noto- 
riety. 

Mr. Francis Newton Thorpe is well quali- 
fied to tell the story of this life of bewilder- 
ingly varied activity, having himself been 
connected with the University and, as it ap-

pears, intimate with its head during the last 
thirteen years of the latter's life. The prepa- 
ration, too, of an earlier work involving re- 
search in much the same field — the painstak- 
ing account of " Franklin and the University 
of Pennsylvania " — has made easier for him 
this presentation of a " second Franklin " and 
his relations to the same institution of learning. 
Something of the charm of Dr. Pepper's per- 
sonality seems to have found its way into the 
pages of his biography, which is a book to 
attract the reader, despite its 555 large octavo 
pages. But we will not send it to the barber's 
with Polonius's beard ; only let it be permitted 
the reviewer to regret that its topical arrange- 
ment has entailed a number of overlappings 
and repetitions, thus increasing its length in a 
manner that tends to try the reader's patience. 

The first intimation to the world at large of 
Dr. Pepper's marked ability was at the time 
of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. 
He discharged with noted success the difficult 
duties of Medical Director, receiving, among 
other tokens of foreign recognition, an appoint- 
ment as Knight Commander of the Order of 
St. Olaf from the King of Norway and Swe- 
den. The executive capacity then displayed 
by him, when but little over thirty years of 
age, together with his fruitful exertions for 
improving the medical school of the Univer- 
sity, paved the way to his election as Provost 
in 1881, after the office had been refused by 
Phillips Brooks and Dr. S. Weir Mitchell. 
To his wonderful ability as a college president 
the present splendid equipment of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania is an impressive mon- 
ument. Where only four unimposing build- 
ings stood in 1881 may now be seen more than 
twenty handsome and well-appointed struc- 
tures. In thirteen years he increased the Uni- 
versity's wealth from $1,600,000 to more than 
$5,000,000. Of his fame as a medical lecturer 
and clinical demonstrator the record of his 
addresses in all parts of the country and the 
testimony of his pupils furnish abundant proof. 

As a medical writer Dr. Pepper stood in 
the front rank. Besides founding the " Med- 
ical Times," he edited, with Dr. John F. Meigs, 
the well-known and authoritative " System of 
Medicine by American Authors," and pub- 
lished numerous articles and pamphlets, the 
fruit of his wide experience as a practising 
physician. The "Text- Book of Medicine by 
American Teachers" was also largely his work. 
But as new authorities are daily supplanting the 



old in medical literature, so that ten years is 
a long life for a medical treatise, his enduring 
monument will be, not his writings, but his 
creations in stone and brick, and what they 
stand for. It will also be long before the pro- 
fession forgets his conspicuously successful and 
brilliant presidency of the Pan-American Med- 
ical Congress at Washington, and the ovation 
given to him by a similar assembly at Mexico 
three years later. The happy combination of 
Anglo-Saxon vigor with the ease and suavity 
of the Latin-American, as well as his fluency 
in a language (the French) better known to 
them than English, won for him an extra- 
ordinary popularity with our southern neigh- 
bors. To fill out still further this imperfect 
sketch of the man, let us quote a few passages, 
either descriptive of him as seen by Mr. Thorpe, 
or embodying in his own words ideas and opin- 
ions characteristic of his life and work. Of 
his appearance in the consulting room his 
biographer says : 

" In his treatment of the sick it was his study to get 
on the side of nature. He trusted much to rest and 
regimen, and, primarily, to getting the mind of the 
patient in a normal frame. He was by nature a psychol- 
ogist and his powers of diagnosis were of the highest 
order. These powers he applied in other interests than 
his medical practice. Each of the innumerable civic and 
educational problems which came before him was met 
as he met the critical medical cases which were pre- 
sented to him for diagnosis. His reasoning faculties 
were wonderfully strong, active, and accurate. . . . 
He seized on causes and effects readily and with almost 
unerring precision, and his mental processes were phe- 
nomenally rapid. With these powers he exercised an 
inspiring sympathy which quickly won confidence. A 
patient felt safe under his care." 

Combining the best features of conservatism 
and progressiveness, he was among the first to 
advocate the elective system in college educa- 
tion ; but his electives were to be in carefully 
planned groups rather than offered singly, thus 
having strict regard to the general bent, not to 
the idle whims, of the immature student. Note- 
worthy, too, is his high estimate of the classics 
as a part of the curriculum. Himself a man of 
science and of affairs, he yet felt moved thus 
to uphold the claims of Greek and Latin in 
an address before the Modern Language Asso- 
ciation : 

" We have nothing to do with the question of the 
necessity of the classics in any and every system of ed- 
ucation worthy of the name. We assume that to be 
conceded beyond discussion. Could Milton have written 
'Paradise Lost' or the 'Elegy on Lycidas,' or Burke 
his oration against Hastings, Landor his Dialogues, 
without a profound study of the classics? Could 
Corneille or Racine, or Goethe or Lessing, or Dante 



1904.] 



THE DIAL

have produced their immortal works without such 
study ? What boots such questioning ? May the day 
never come when the glorious languages of Homer, of 
Plato, of Sophocles, and of Cicero, of Virgil, of Horace 
shall not be recognized as the very keystone of the 
highest and most inspiring education which can be 
imparted." 

This, of course, is better in fervid oration than 
in cold print ; but the attitude behind it all is 
significant. The notes drawn from Dr. Pep- 
per's diary are illuminative to the student of 
his character. His definition of genius makes 
it to be " the power of sustaining concentrated 
attention in a rare degree." Of Matthew 
Arnold, just after his lecture in Philadelphia, 
the diary records : 

" Vigorous and well preserved — bad enunciation 
— terrible pronunciation of some words, as • girls, 
geerU ' — quiet, clear, caustic, appreciative. . . . 

"Took breakfast with Matthew Arnold; one would 
naturally think, « What a good fellow, with frank and 
easy manners — a strong, fine figure — and a strong 
face'; but he mouths his words and talks with pro- 
truded lips and indistinct utterance when addressing 
an audience of any considerable size, altogether the 
result of defective elocution. Voice sufficiently pleas- 
ant in ordinary conversation, and with force enough to 
be heard clear enough in any hall if properly managed. 
How often we notice this in English literary men, even 
their public men, whose education and pursuits have 
led you to expect better things in the way of public 
speaking." 

Civic reform, Dr. Pepper held, was to be 
sought through educational methods rather 
than in ward politics. Whether just or unjust, 
this is his opinion of the Municipal League : 

" Their purpose seems to be the old business of put- 
ting up special candidates for special little offices, 
spending a lot of money, and getting licked like thun- 
der. That is what has kept me off from all these 
reform movements; that, instead of earnest educational 
work, such as the Civic Club is doing, and Brinley 
is doing for University Extension, they go into ward 
politics." 

A paragraph of Mr. Thorpe's will give some 
conception of the crushing press of engage- 
ments always weighing upon Dr. Pepper. 

" On one occasion, at a theatre-party which he was 
giving, after some fifteen minutes, he excused himself, 
and was gone three-quarters of an hour. Remaining a 
short time, he excused himself again, and was gone 
nearly as long. He then returned for a moment, and 
excused himself a third time. He had appeared at 
three functions, at two of which he had made formal 
addresses; the third disappearance was for a consulta- 
tion. While under great pressure of work he occa- 
sionally worked thirty-six or even forty-eight hours 
without interruption except for a bite of food." 

Dr. Horace Howard Furness, in presenting 
Dr. Pepper's portrait to the American Philo- 
sophical Society in behalf of the contributing 



members, paid him a tribute well worth quot- 
ing. He said, in part : 

'« It is pleasant to hope that during his lifetime Dr. 
Pepper was at least faintly conscious that his influence 
for good was thus wide-spread, and that among his fel- 
low-citizens he had become the representative of great 
educational and civic movements. . . . This is not an 
occasion for eulogy, nor have I any capacity for analyz- 
ing character (who can analyze his own ?), but by one 
noteworthy element in Dr. Pepper's temperament I 
was always impressed, and this is a sense of proportion. 
He had the faculty of differentiating values. He was 
never astray among the important and the unimportant. 
His perspective was always true. . . . Ambition is pro- 
verbially selfish, and that he was ambitious we all know. 
But herein was almost his crowning quality. His ambi- 
tion was never for himself. . . . Rarely shall we find the 
man more thoroughly, utterly unselfish than he. To 
the reflex effect upon himself or his fortunes of any 
course which he deemed of moment, I think he gave 
never a single thought. That a man of as forceful a 
character should meet with opposition and even detrac- 
tion is inevitable. But we have solemn words of warn- 
ing ringing in our ears: * Woe unto you when all men 
speak well of you I ' Therein is found our consolation 
and his ever-present balm." 

What wore this man out so early was work. 
Never at ease unless pushing on half a dozen 
gigantic enterprises at once, he neglected to 
cultivate the art of enjoying leisure. One 
note in his diary describes him as working 
seventy-two hours without sufficient intermis- 
sion to go to bed. In 1894 he resigned the 
presidency of the University, but the easing of 
one burden only led to the assumption of others 
hardly less heavy. He knew, as a wise physi- 
cian, the penalty he was incurring for his in- 
discretion ; but he declared if his life were 
to live over again he would follow the same 
course. 

Mr. Thorpe tells his story in a way to arrest 
and hold the attention. A little more con- 
ciseness, however, a more successful avoidance 
of repetitious, might have been attained. A 
few lapses, too, from good English might have 
been corrected. " Accrue " he uses in the 
passive voice ; " less " occurs for " fewer ", 
and even as early as the third page of the 
Preface a jarring note is encountered in the 
very easily avoidable misuse of " would " for 
" should." But only hypercriticism can refuse 
to the author hearty thanks for his handsome 
accomplishment of a difficult task. In follow- 
ing Dr. Pepper's varied career, he had to 
narrate the life, not of one man, but of many 
men under one name. For producing so clear 
a portrait of this Protean individuality he de- 
serves high praise. p^^^^.^ F. Bicknell.

Problems of the Home.* 

It is impossible to read the books of Mrs. 
Charlotte Perkins Gilman without realizing 
that their author is deeply, sometimes passion- 
ately, in earnest. One cannot fail to see, 
likewise, that most of her radical views will 
gain but slow headway, for the present at least, 
even among women themselves, to whom chiefly 
her writings and speeches are addressed. Her 
work on "The Home, Its Work and Influ- 
ence " is a further development of ideas ex- 
pressed in "Women and Economics," pub- 
lished a few years ago, and emphasizing the 
essential social equality of man and woman. 
Mrs. Gilman's ideals are high, as will be seen by 
the following extracts from her Introduction: 

" The home should offer to the individual rest, peace, 
quiet, comfort, health, and that degree of personal 
expression requisite; and these conditions should be 
maintained by the best methods of the time. . . . We 
are here to perform our best service to society, and 
to find our best individual growth and expression; a 
right home is essential to both these uses." 

She makes a plea for homes that shall pro- 
vide greater scope for individuality, greater 
privacy for each and every inmate, and a 
reduction of expense for those who must main- 
tain them. She finds the two greatest errors to 
be "the maintenance of primitive industries 
in a modern industrial community, and the 
confinement of women to those industries and 
their limited area of expression." 

In the chapter called "Domestic Mythol- 
ogy " the author protests against the reverence 
for the old merely because it is old, — the 
blind following in the footsteps of our fore- 
bears ; against the indiscriminate " mother- 
worship," which makes us assume that because 
a woman is a mother, she must know the best 
way to care for and bring up children, as 
well as the best way to maintain the home in 
peace and comfort; and against the fetich of 
the " feminine touch," which is popularly sup- 
posed to beautify everything on which it is 
laid. As the ordinary home is at present 
maintained, the time of the over-burdened 
house- wife is consumed in cooking, cleaning, 
and sewing; what time, Mrs. Gilman asks, has 
she for child-culture and self-culture? On the 
other hand, in the home of the well-to-do the 
work of the home is done by " ignorant and 
inferior young women, under conditions of con- 
stant change.'" Cooking and child-tending are 
here left to lower grades of labor, whereas, for 

♦The Home. Its Work and Influence. By Charlotte 
Perkins Gilman. New York : McClure, Phillips & Co. 



the good of the race they should be raised to 
the rank of professions. Domestic life like- 
wise suffers from domestic seclusion. In fact, 
Mrs. Gilman believes that most if not all of 
the industries now performed in the home 
could be better and more cheaply performed 
outside of it by professional workers ; that 
organization should have its place in home life 
as in business life; that the results of modern 
ingenuity should not be confined to hotels and 
other public places, but should be used to 
release the housewife from the burdens that 
keep her down. 

Mrs. Gilman believes that the homes of 
to-day, with rare exceptions, foster selfishness, 
cowardice, untruth, injustice, self-conscious- 
ness; that woman is undeveloped physically, 
mentally, and morally, and over-developed on 
the feminine side. She says: "If the woman 
was fully developed on the human side, she 
would cease to be over-developed on the fem- 
inine side. If she had her fair share of world- 
life, she would expect of her husband that he 
be a satisfactory man, but not that he be a 
satisfactory world, which is quite beyond him." 
Hospitality, as at present practised, is abused ; 
it should mean the entertaining of one's inti- 
mate friends in the home, while there should 
be public rooms for larger gatherings. Mrs. 
Gilman's idea, when carried to its conclusion, 
is that when the woman is freed from the 
restrictions of house-keeping and child-rearing, 
and able to direct her energies into the lines 
of work for which she is best fitted, likewise 
relieving the husband of part of his too-heavy 
burden, she and the man will become not only 
better husbands and wives, fathers and moth- 
ers, but also better citizens, enlarging their 
social activities, widening the range of their 
interests, and performing their functions as in- 
dividuals, as home-makers, and as part of the 
social whole, more nearly as civilization in the 
present age demands. 

It is undoubtedly true that two tendencies 
have been strongly felt in recent years, — one 
an earnest effort toward some solution of the 
"servant problem," chiefly felt in the estab- 
lishment of training-schools for servants and 
their mistresses; the other, the increasingly 
large number of married women who enter 
business life. Nevertheless, this number is 
not yet large as proportioned to the women 
who really prefer home-life, nor can it ever be 
so long as women are mothers. During the 
child-bearing period, no woman is free to enter 
upon a continuous business life ; nor could she

261 



do so successfully if she would. This will 
always be the strongest argument against Mrs. 
Gilman's theories. It is true that she does 
show forth some of the causes of failure in the 
home, and suggests many needed reforms. 
But doubts will exist as to the wisdom of her 
methods of cure. The world is not yet ready 
for changes so radical as some of those that 
she suggests. Much can be done in the way 
of improved sanitation, and in a division of 
industries that will relieve the servant-problem 
of some of its worst bugbears; home-makers 
and mothers can and should receive a training 
that will make them wiser and more skilful. 
But whatever may be the reason, a majority 
of the women of to-day would not accept a life 
that would take them for the greater part of 
the time outside the home. Moreover, with- 
out a violent readjustment of conditions in the 
business world, it would not be possible for 
them all to find positions ; and without special 
training, which only the few are able to enjoy, 
they could not enter professional life. 

While not always coherent, and occasion- 
ally showing signs of careless or hasty con- 
struction, this book is worthy of sober consid- 
eration. It is the result of earnest conviction, 
it shows in an extreme form certain tendencies 
of the day, and it offers some suggestions that 
may well receive attention from thoughtful 
students of large social problems.

Steps in "Western Expansion.* 



The centennial anniversary of the Louisiana 
territorial acquisition is responsible for the ap- 
pearance of many additions to the historical 
literature of the Middle West. Territorial ex- 
pansion was nearly an unknown topic in our 
country, until the effects of the recent war with 
Spain called attention to the insular accessions 
which continued the remarkable continental ex- 
pansion. Two of the volumes considered in 
the present review belong to an "Expansion 
of the Republic" series; while the third con- 
cerns the Louisiana Purchase alone. 

The volume by Mr. Austin, "Steps in the 
Expansion of our Territory," is a solid one, 
as might be expected from the chief of the

Bureau of Statistics of the national Depart- 
ment of Commerce and Labor. It abounds in 
statistics of square miles of territory, bushels 
of products, and millions of population. In 
this respect, it is a compendium of information 
rather than an attraction for the general reader. 
It is really a study of the admission of the sev- 
eral states into the Union, together with a 
sketch of the territorial addition from which 
they were created. A preliminary chapter de- 
scribes the colonization and development of the 
original domain, and two appended chapters give 
a statistical sketch of our foreign possessions. 
As connecting links, a geueral commentary on 
the leading events of American history runs 
through the book. A vast amount of informa- 
tion is afforded on the public land system, the 
development of industries, and comparisons with 
other peoples. Presumably, the statistics are 
correct. But in the commentary on the course 
of affairs a number of errors have crept in. 
The title of "United States of America" does 
not date from July 4, although that makes a 
pleasing statement, but from special action of 
Congress on September 9, 1776. Congress did 
not authorize George Rogers Clark (not Clarke) 
to make the expedition into the Northwest, but 
Virginia, under Governor Patrick Henry, took 
that initiative. Vergennes is charged with pro- 
posing that the Americans be deprived of the 
Mississippi Valley in the peace of 1783. Jay, 
the negotiator, says that Vergennes was " very 
cool and reserved" toward Aranda's suggestion, 
and there is no evidence that Rayneval's pro- 
posed division was presented to him. Doniol 
makes this clear, and frees Vergennes, if not 
the court of France generally, from the charge 
of opposing the American title. Spain aban- 
doned her claim to West Florida in 1795, not 
1798. The classic names proposed by Jeffer- 
son for the states of the Northwest do not ap- 
pear in the Ordinance of 1784, as the context 
of their description makes it seem. The Ohia 
Company of Associators was formed some time 
preceding the purchase of land and passage of 
the Ordinance of 1787, instead of after that 
time. 

It is evident in advance that any volume on 
explorations of the Rocky Mountain region 
must be taken up largely with the Lewis and 
Clark expedition, since materials for it are most 
abundant. Considering the length of the jour- 
ney, its timeliness, and its results, one may 
easily pronounce it the most important under- 
taking of the kind in American history. Mr. 
Thwaites, in his "Brief History of Rocky Moun- 



262

tain Exploration," has given it a mention in 
his subtitle as being the exploration jyar excel- 
lence. From Balboa's crossing of the Isthmus of 
Darien to the construction of the Pacific railways 
is the space covered in the volume. Cook, Qua- 
dra, Verendrye, and Captain Gray find places 
in the earlier chapters, and Long, and Pike, and 
Fiemont in the later portions, with Lewis and 
Clark making, however, the bulk of the book. 
The work is in Mr. Thwaites's well-known 
style, and pleasantly calls attention to one as- 
pect of the conquest of the continent. 

The need of a condensed sketch of the Lou- 
isiana Purchase has been well supplied by Mr. 
Ripley Hitchcock, whose little book on that 
subject falls into four parts, Discovery and Ac- 
quisition, the Lewis and Clark exploration, the 
other discoveries, and the Industrial Develop- 
ment of the region. As in the volume by Mr. 
Thwaites, a large share of space — nearly a 
hundred pages — is given to Lewis and Clark ; 
while thirty pages suffice to cover the negotia- 
tions, the transfer, and all constitutional ques- 
tions involved. The most novel feature in the 
outline is to be found in the rather picturesque 
treatment of the development of the Purchase, 
due to the author's connection with a series 
bearing on various phases of Western life.

A SOITTHERNER'S IjIFB OF JEFFERSON.* 



Of making books on Jefferson there is no 
end; and Mr. Thomas E. Watson presents us 
with the latest addition to the collection. He 
appropriately entitles his contribution "The 
Life and Times of Thomas Jefferson "; for he 
has treated that statesman's times quite as fully 
as he has his life. Mr. Watson's portrait of 
Jefferson does not differ greatly from the one 
commonly accepted ; though drawn in fuller 
detail, it gives essentially the same familiar 
personality. The acceptability of the book will 
be found largely in the pictures presented of 
Jefferson's times, and of the work and accom- 
plishments of his great conteimporaries. The 
style of the book is sketchy. Its fifty-one chap- 
ters are so many outlines of episodes of the era 
in which its principal subject lived, many of 
them connected with him only by the coinci- 
dence in dates ; a group of parti-colored beads, 
strung upon the thread of one political career. 

•Thb Life and Times of Thomas Jefferson. By 
Thomas £. Watson. Illustrated. New York : D. Appleton 
&Co. 



Not that the incidents sketched are foreign to 
the main subject, for they are the transactions 
in which Jefferson would have been profoundly 
interested, even though he had not participated 
in them ; but they do not profess to furnish 
either a complete biography of the man or a 
history of his time. The reader will enjoy the 
sympathetic portraiture of the character of 
Washington, and be entertained by the lively 
description of the strenuous activities of John 
Paul Jones, George Rogers Clark, and others 
of Jefferson's contemporaries ; but he will not 
easily be led to suppose Mr. Watson's para- 
graphs to constitute serious history or biog- 
raphy. With all his evident historical tastes, 
and his fondness for historical research, the 
author does not exhibit the judicial tempera- 
ment necessary to the historian. Indeed, he 
is too much of a critical controversialist to suc- 
ceed in writing history. The frequency and 
ardor with which he controverts the conclusions 
and the deductions of other writers indicate 
a part of his mission to be to confound the 
mighty. His pages redound with sarcastic ref- 
erences to the errors of which he convicts 
Messrs. W. E. Curtis, S. G. Fisher, H. C. 
Lodge, Woodrow Wilson, and other writers. 
An excerpt from a passage complaining that 
American history has been too much devoted 
to New England and its inhabitants will illus- 
trate the critical spirit and methods of the 
book. 

'•Entirely too much has been made of trivial New 
England incidents and of third-rate New England in- 
dividuals. Too many New England mole- hills have 
been magnified into historical mountains. Even Henry 
Cabot Lodge, though he made a manful attempt, could 
not cut himself loose from the swollen body of dead 
tradition. As to Woodrow Wilson's book, — well, we 
will change the subject." 

Even though Mr. Watson's readers might 
sometimes concur in his criticisms, they will 
usually prefer to find such complaints in an- 
other setting. This form of controversy is 
such a favorite with Mr. Watson as to suggest 
the doubt whether he is himself a safe guide 
in historical exegesis. One is scarcely sur- 
prised to find him, in his zeal for the just fame 
of Jefferson, saying of the Virginia statesman's 
draft of his famous "Ordinance," that "It was 
in this celebrated Ordinance of the Northwest- 
ern Territory that the first suggestion of a 
plan for the admission of future states ap- 
peared"; the fact being that Maryland had, 
as early as October, 1776, advanced this prop- 
osition as a part of the destiny of that Terri- 
tory, and that her delegates had introduced it 



1904.]

into the Congress in October, 1777, before the 
Articles of Confederation had taken final shape. 
So, also, historical study has given place to 
partisan theory, when Mr. Watson character- 
izes the non-importation agreement of the col- 
onists as follows : 

" In fact, the attitude taken by Washington, Lee, 
Henry, Adams, Sherman, Jay, Dickinson, and Rutledge 
was substantially that of a labor-union of the present 
day during a struggle with a capitalistic trust. Those 
Americans who would not join the association and boy- 
cott Great Britain were 'enemies to the liberties of 
their country,' and were themselves to be boycotted." 

This comparison belittles those Fathers of 
the Republic, and becomes possible only by ig- 
noring the legal and constitutional principles 
which were the bed-rock of the non-importation 
agreement and of all the contentions of the 
American colonists, nothing similar to which 
distinguishes the modern struggles between 
labor and capital. 

In like manner, the author is apparently 
seeking to sustain a preconceived theory when 
he argues: 

"The Mecklenburg Resolutions were in effect the 
first of American declarations of Independence. Rhode 
Island soon followed. Then came the town-meetings 
of Massachusetts. Then Virginia, May 6th, closely 
followed, having no idea that any other colony had al- 
ready shaken off the burden of allegiance to Great 
Britain." 

" After the Declaration of Independence, and its rati- 
fication by each State, each one of the thirteen col- 
onies most certainly considered itself a sovereign State. 
The only bond of Union was a common cause and a 
common danger. Their delegations to the Congress 
did not bind them to a confederation any more than their 
Committees of Correspondence had done." 

The idea that there were many declarations 
of independence by which the thirteen colonies 
severally revolted against Great Britain, and 
the theories advanced by Mr. Watson to sus- 
tain this idea, run counter to many of the facts 
of our history, not the least impressive of which 
are these: that North Carolina on April 12, 
Rhode Island on May 4, Virginia on May 6, 
and five other colonies at later dates down to 
June 28, 1776, expressly instructed their dele- 
gates to join in one Declaration of Indepen- 
dence and in forming a confederation for ex- 
ternal purposes, while reserving to the people 
of each colony local self-government for inter- 
nal purposes ; that the language of these sev- 
eral instructions is so similar as to indicate a 
common purpose pervading the colonists ; that 
no action inconsistent with this was taken by 
any colony; and that two other colonies, New 
York and South Carolina, had previously re- 



solved that they would leave the momentous 
question of Independence to be determined by 
the Continental Congress. It was this action 
of Virginia on May 6, 1776, which Mr. Watson 
seeks to interpret as a separate revolt by that 
colony. 

In these and other instances are manifested 
the peculiar political views of Mr. Watson, 
which, however, do not debar him from writ- 
ing a sprightly and entertaining book. In his 
chapter on "The Governor of Virginia," the 
experiences of Jefferson as governor are con- 
spicuously overlooked, while the troubles of 
the "times" are vividly portrayed; but there 
is compensation for this omission as to the per- 
sonal Jefferson in the minute account that 
comes later of his interesting experiences in 
France. A responsive chord in the hearts of 
students will be aroused by the author's fervid 
appeal for a reprint of Jefferson's valuable 
" Notes on Virginia."

Recent Books on Education.* 

Students of genetic psychology or child study 
have long been waiting for some well-organized 
general survey which should present in readable 
form the results of the many studies in this field. 
Prof. E. A. Kirkpatrick, in his " Fundamentals of 
Child Study," has attempted to meet this demand 
and at the same time write a text-book for class use 
in normal schools and colleges. The larger half of 
his book is devoted to a discussion of the different 
human instincts from infancy to manhood ; the au- 
thor by this method avoids the necessity of marking 
off and characterizing the periods of growth. Aside 
from instincts, the subjects dealt with are physical 
growth and development, native motor activities and 
general order of development, development of intel- 
lect, heredity, individuality, abnormalities, and child 
study applied in schools. A.ppended to each chap-

ter is a list of questioDs bearing on the text bat not 
covered by it, designed to stimulate independent 
thought among the students. Each chapter also 
contains a bibliography, well adapted for class use, 
of the materials used. The general bibliography at 
the beginning of the book is by no means as judi- 
ciously selected, works of great value by such men as 
Preyer, Baldwin, Sully, and Compayrd being men- 
tioned by the side of Wiggin's " Children's Rights " 
and Du Bois's " Beckoning of Little Hands." This, 
however, is a matter of small importance. Consid- 
ering the difficulties of the subject. Professor Kirk- 
patrick's book must be pronounced a success of the 
first order. The author's thorough knowledge of 
psychology has protected him from crude general- 
izations ; his sense of proportion is good ; the ma- 
terial is well digested, and the practical suggestions 
that he ventures upon from time to time are useful. 
The book is well adapted to the serious lay reader, 
and at tbe same time is valuable to the student. 

Prof. Irving King's " The Psychology of Child 
Development " covers the same ground as the work 
just spoken of, though from an entirely different 
standpoint ; the aim in this case being not so much 
the organization of facts as the interpretation of the 
more fundamental phenomena. Professor King has 
a thesis to defend, which in brief is this : A great 
mistake has been made by Preyer and others in 
studying the mental life of children ; this mistake 
consists in employing the mental processes or facul- 
ties of the adult as instruments in measuring and 
describing the child's intelligence. The true method 
is functional, it regards the child's experience as a 
unity and describes it as such instead of trying to 
discover the rudimentary beginnings of adult men- 
tal processes to single acts. In his application of 
this view to infancy and early childhood. Professor 
King has been successful in making the child's ac- 
tivity seem more intelligible than in the writings of 
any previous thinker. His thesis leads him to mag- 
nify the difference between the child and the adult 
mind, and to somewhat exaggerate the difficulties 
in the way of understanding children's ideas after 
the first three or four years. As a running com- 
mentary on the methods generally in use, this book 
will perform good service, its function being dis- 
tinctly critical. No recent educational book gives 
more evidence of painstaking thought, of the care- 
ful consideration of a subject from a single point of 
view. It is an important contribution to the litera- 
ture of the subject. There is a fairly representative 
but by no means complete bibliography in the ap- 
pendix. 

The third volume of the present group, that by 
Dr. E. L. Thorndike of Columbia on '< Educational 
Psychology," also discusses method in child study. 
It is a plea for more rigorously scientific standards 
and methods than those that have hitherto been 
largely employed. The volume consists of a sum- 
mary and criticism of all the studies which the 
author considers sufficiently accurate to be of value. 



The territory covered is indicated by the following 
list of topics : the measurement of mental traits, the 
distribution of mental traits, the relationship be- 
tween mental traits, original and acquired traits, 
mental inheritance, the influence of environment, 
the influence of special training upon general abili- 
ties, the influence of selection, the development of 
mental traits with age, sex difference, exceptional 
children, the relationship of mental and physical 
traits, and broader studies of human nature. The 
last chapter treats of the questionnaire method of 
investigation, which Dr. Thorndike condemns, care- 
fully pointing out the abuses to which it is liable. 
There can be little question that this criticism is 
greatly needed ; still if we are to throw out all data 
that cannot be tested by the methods of the exact 
sciences, progress is likely to be slow in all of the 
social disciplines for some time to come. Several 
sections of Professor Kirkpatrick's book show that 
in the hands of a thinker who knows and makes 
allowance for the limitations of the questionnaire 
and similar methods, results of significance can be 
achieved. 

The latest book of Prof. M. V. O'Shea treats of 
the philosophy of education, and is entitled <' Edu- 
cation as Adjustment." It attempts to define edu- 
cation from the standpoint of evolutionary philoso- 
phy, and to show the futility of all educational 
theory founded on purely logical or metaphysical 
considerations. The first three chapters contain the 
discussion of education as a science ; after which 
Professor O'Shea treats at some length the mean- 
ing and aim of education. The last and longest 
section of the book, "the method of attaining ad- 
justment," is a treatise on the psychology of the 
learning process. In the first two divisions of the 
work the author is laboring under the obvious dis- 
advantage of possessing only a second-hand knowl- 
edge of biology and philosophy. He has indus- 
triously collected a large mass of material, but it 
is poorly classified and the interpretation is me- 
chanically forced. The statements are inexact, and 
many minor sections have no logical bearing on the 
main argument. Professor O'Shea's equipment for 
the work may be judged from the following quota- 
tions : " Direct observations and statistical investi- 
gations are made with something of the exactness 
and completeness of detail in the field of mental 
development by such persons as Preyer, Hall, Shinn, 
Baldwin, and others that were attained by Darwin 
in the field of biology or Newton in physics or Gal- 
ileo in astronomy " (p. 42). Locke devised " innate 
faculties and other things " (p. 49). The psycho- 
logical half of the work is much better done, and as 
a critique of existing methods deserves recognition 
by the side of the three books already mentioned. 
There is an excellent discussion of the dogma of 
formal discipline. The present volume, which de- 
fines the author's fundamental positions, forms the 
introduction to a series which is to include treatises 
on " Educational Aspects of Mental Development,"

"The Values of Studies," "The Psychology of 
Method in Teaching," and " The Organization and 
Management of Schools." 

Under the title "A Modern School," Professor 
Paul H. Hanus of Harvard has collected his recent 
educational utterances. The volume hears for the 
most part on secondary education, particularly the 
first five papers, which expand and reinforce the posi- 
tions that Professor Hanus advanced in an earlier 
volume. The sixth and seventh essays, " Our Faith 
in Education " and " Obstacles to Educational 
Progress," are wider in scope, and present a well- 
balanced estimate of the attitude of the American 
people toward public education. The eighth chap- 
ter, " Education as a University Subject and the 
Professional Training of College- Bred Teachers," 
justifies the existence and notes the functions of the 
college training school for teachers. The last chap- 
ter, " Graduate Testimony on the Elective System," 
gives us the result of a questionnaire circulated 
among Harvard graduates of recent years. One 
who is seeking for revolutionary opinions, startling 
paradoxes, or brilliant flashes of pedagogical in- 
sight may as well avoid this volume, for it consists 
of sober, mature, and carefully-weighed opinion on 
certain controverted questions of great practical 
importance. Professor Hanus shows great ability 
in interpreting the standpoint of the professional 
school man to the general public ; the citizen who 
wants to know the best professional opinion of the 
country on questions relating to secondary education 
will do well to read this book. The author does not 
let his fair-mindedness interfere with the promul- 
gation of a definite pedagogical platform. He be- 
lieves in public high schools, in a six year high-school 
course, in the culture rather than the formal sub- 
jects in the secondary curriculum in the elective 
system, and in encouraging manual training and 
the industrial subjects. 

The fourth volume of " Lippincott's Educational 
Series " consists of " The Educational Theory of 
Immanuel Kant," as translated and edited by Dr. 
Edward Franklin Buchner of the University of 
Alabama. The first third of the book is given up 
to the author's introduction ; the next section con- 
tains a translation of Kant's lecture-notes on peda- 
gogy ; and the concluding portion is made up of 
selections on education from Kant's other writings. 
No attempt is made to trace the influence of Kant 
on the educational theory of his own or succeeding 
generations, attention merely being called to the 
different editions of " Ueber Padagogik." With 
this exception, the work may be highly commended. 
The author has striven against the tendency, which 
must have been a strong one here, to magnify 
the importance of the subject. His introduction, 
while appreciative, shows scholarship and critical 
balance. The translation is in good idiomatic En- 
glish, a difficult achievement in view of the broken 
and fragmentary character of the lecture notes.

Briefs on New Books. 



Mr. Angus Hamilton's volume on 
iMndofih^ Korea (Scribner), though timely and 

Momtng Calm. . \ ^ , ,. , ,l ^ • 

interesting, contains little that is 
new. The great mass of information in the text 
has already appeared in the pages of the Korean 
Repository, the Korea Review, and the Transac- 
tions of the Asiatic Society of Korea, whence it has 
been extracted, digested, and pleasantly re-pre- 
sented. Indeed, the author would have done well 
to state his obligations more specifically. Having 
spent several weeks and possibly months as news- 
paper correspondent in the country, he was in just 
that frame of mind in which a man feels most like 
writing a book, — that is, when he is without those 
later judgments that overrule former hasty impres- 
sions, and when the picture on his mind is as at- 
tractive as a poster, from the very fact that it lacks 
perspective. Mr. Hamilton's style is rapid and his 
method interesting, and altogether the work is most 
readable, although (except where the author is tell- 
ing of his personal adventures) one feels that there 
is little solidity in the text and that he is mainly a 
purveyor rather than a producer. Mr. Hamilton 
begins his personal narrative by an account of the 
coast of Korea, with its fascinations of floral color 
and changing landscapes seen as one threads his 
way among the numerous islands on the west side. 
We have a lively description of Chemulpo, the port 
of the capital, and its trade, in which the Japanese 
are pictured as a turbulent and uncanny lot; and 
also of Seoul, the capital, with its many modern 
edifices, legations, French cathedral, and occidental 
features — including tall chimneys and trolley cars. 
The white clothing of the people, starched and 
glistening in the case of the upper classes and of a 
dingy hue among the lower folks, gives one a sug- 
gestion of " the orthodox notion of the Resurrec- 
tion." The men are fine, well built, and dignified 
in their bearing, showing evidences of descent from 
the semi-savages of northeastern Asia and the Cau- 
casian peoples from the West. Slavery, especially 
of the females, is common, and the standard of 
morality is rather low. Several chapters are de- 
voted to the " emperor," and the tawdry pageantry 
always visible on his rare public appearances. The 
results of government in Korea are little else than 
oppression and poverty for the people, for the coun- 
try still clings to its ancient system of supporting 
thousands of civil and military officers, real or re- 
puted, in idleness, so that there are few incentives 
to wealth or industry. Of the modern interests, 
British, American, Japanese, French, German, and 
Belgian, the author gives an account that is full, 
clear, and timely. He devotes chapters to Fusan, 
Wonsan, and other treaty ports, though one can 
easily see that his notes are mainly from his read- 
ing and not from close observation on the spot. 
The later chapters, in which he describes his 
journeys across the country and his stay among the

Buddhist priests in the monasteries, are the most 
interesting of all. Appendices, statistics, index, and 
maps complete a very pertinent and informing 
book. 

A stimulating ^he publication of a series of novel 
monograph on and valuable "Monographs of the 
Jefferson. American Revolution " is announced 

by the University Press of Cambridge and Messrs. 
A. W. Elson & Co. of Boston, in conjunction. The 
general character and style of this series is indi- 
cated in the initial number, a posthumous essay on 
Thomas Jefferson written by Paul Leicester Ford. 
The volume appears in an edition de luxe, in large 
quarto form, printed on Imperial Japan paper, in 
beautiful typography, and finely illustrated by an 
original etching from the Stuart portrait of Jeffer- 
son in Bowdoin college, and a photogravure from 
the profile of Jefferson, also by Stuart. This hand- 
some edition is a noteworthy specimen of the best 
possibilities of the printer's art. It is limited to 
500 copies, so that it is destined to remain, as it is 
now, a rarity. Copies of a few of Jefferson's 
original papers are appended, one of which is that 
stirring first draft of the Declaration of Indepen- 
dence, whose incisive invective of George the 
Third's devotion to the perpetuation of African 
slavery in America stirs the reader's blood even at 
this day. Mr. Ford's contribution to this unique 
'< monograph " is an original essay, completed 
shortly before his death, and never before pub- 
lished. In his well-known trenchant style, the 
writer has endeavored to portray the political feel- 
ings and views of his subject, to illustrate the 
inconsistencies and contradictions that beclouded 
his political theories and actions, and to throw 
light upon the vexing problem of what were in 
fact his political motives. But with all of this 
writer's perspicacious study of an era so attractive 
to him, and with all the brilliancy of diction with 
which he unfolds to us what he has observed, we 
cannot deny that the problem which allured him 
remains unsolved, and that our Jefferson is as 
much of a mystery as ever. Mr. Ford thinks he 
discovers Jefferson's secret in part when he aligns 
that puzzling subject over against Washington and 
Franklin. Is it a correct deduction from the his- 
tory of the revolutionary era, to say that Jeffer- 
son's work was permanent in character, while the 
contributions of Washington and Franklin to their 
day were merely ephemeral ? To take one in- 
stance, — is there any more enduring force to-day 
in our governmental system than the Federal Con- 
stitution, for which both Washington and Franklin 
did so much, and to which Jefferson contributed so 
little in comparison ? Mr. Ford presents Jefferson 
as the great protagonist of " the masses " as against 
*' the classes," and seeks to find in this the basis of 
his great fame. But he fails to name for us any- 
one who at that time was championing " the classes " 
as against " the masses." It surely could not have 
been Washington, the one man who had the oppor- 



tunity to promote an American kingship, and who 
indignantly rebuked the suggestion ; nor Franklin, 
the exponent in two hemispheres of the possibilities 
of American democracy. Mr. Ford is astute to 
note Jefferson's failure to apply, as President, his 
own theories concerning a strict construction of 
the Constitution. He does not seem quite ready 
to admit that Jefferson proceeded without reserve 
to apply and enforce in practice the Federalist the- 
ories which he had formerly reprobated; a fact 
which enhances the Jeffersonian puzzle. The truth 
is that partisanship went to such lengths as to make 
it, both for the men of those days and for ourselves, 
an unsafe guide to generalization. The Federalists 
did not attempt to build up " the classes " at the 
expense of '' the masses "; they sought to strengthen 
the national government, not at the expense of any, 
but in the interest of all citizens. Jefferson may 
have once supposed it to be his mission to oppose 
and thwart " the classes." But he must have 
learned the contrary before he died. Mr. Ford's 
monograph is a sprightly contribution to the dis- 
cussion of the interesting question, '' For what did 
Jefferson stand ? " He has more sharply stated 
the great contradictions and apparent inconsisten- 
cies that have made Jefferson so deep a problem. 
Thus he has left us a legacy of no slight value; for 
it may stimulate, while it has not closed, that dis- 
cussion. 

Some eighteenth The volume of " Eighteenth Century 
century estimates Essays on Shakespeare" (Macmil- 
of Shakespeare. j^n) , edited by Mr. D. Nichol Smith, 
is a successful attempt to show that the reputation 
of Shakespeare in the nineteenth century was not 
" made in Germany." The editor has brought to- 
gether the critical introductions to six eighteenth- 
century editions of Shakespeare — those of Rowe, 
Pope, Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson, 
— besides Dennis's three letters "On the Genius 
and Writings of Shakespeare," Farmer's " Essay 
on the Learning of Shakespeare," and Maurice 
Morgan's " Essay on the Dramatic Character of 
Sir John Falstaff." The praise, sometimes extrav- 
agant, bestowed on the dramatist by these upholders 
of a dramatic tradition quite different from his is 
sufficient evidence that the Shakespeare cult was 
uninterrupted from Dryden to Coleridge. We do 
not, of course, forget that the plays were mangled 
in presentation ; but of that charge the present age 
is not wholly guiltless. It is worth remembering, 
too, that Johnson found in Congreve's " Mourning 
Bride " a finer passage than any in Shakespeare ; 
that in Addison's view, " Otway shines in the pas- 
sionate parts more than any other of our English 
poets," and that Shaftesbury prefaces his very mod- 
erate praise of "Hamlet" with a caveat setting 
forth the poet's " natural rudeness, his unpolished 
style, his antiquated phrase and wit, his want of 
method and coherence, and his deficiency in almost 
all the graces and ornaments of this kind of writ- 
ings." Nor is Dennis quite happy in his remark 



1904.] 



THE DIAL

on Shakespeare's blank verse : " Such verse we 
make when we are writing prose; we make such 
verse in common conversation." Nevertheless, with 
all necessary allowance for limitations of taste, 
these men praised Shakespeare ardently and praised 
him well. It is Dennis '' who loves and admires 
his charms and makes them one of his chief de- 
lights, who sees him and reads him over and over 
and still remains unsatiated." Indeed, these essays 
are far from being of mere historical value ; at 
least three of them — Pope's, Johnson's, and (nota- 
bly) Morgan's — are intrinsically good criticism, 
while the subject of Farmer's famous paper is of 
perennial interest, as Mr. Churton CoUins's recent 
" Fortnightly " articles prove. The editor deserves 
especially well of all Shakespeare students for ren- 
dering Morgan's essay accessible. The student of 
eighteenth-century literary history also will find in 
Theobald's strictures upon Pope and in Warburton's 
upon Theobald admirable examples of the fine art 
of innuendo, brought to such perfection by the 
Augustans. The editor's introduction is a valuable 
essay on "Shakespearian Criticism in the Eighteenth 
Century," the only fault of which is an occasional 
suggestion of irrelevance and confusion due to the 
compression of a large amount of material. The 
numerous allusions in the text of the essays are 
abundantly annotated, and there is an excellent in- 
dex. This volume will be of far greater service to 
the student of Shakespeare than many modern lit- 
erary essays or imaginary biographies. 

By a natural though not altogether 
happy economy of mental effort man- 
kind has a way of simplifying the 
careers of great men, satisfied with a general con- 
ception and unconsciously fitting this over every 
phase, with little regard to the notion of develop- 
ment. Those who cherish such a summary view 
of Napoleon Bonaparte will be inclined to rub their 
eyes a little as they read M. Gilbert Augustin- 
Thierry's book on "The Plot of the Placards" 
(Scribner), for their first discovery will be that 
among the soldiery in 1802 the First Consul was 
regarded as too fond of a peace policy, and that 
some of the army leaders actually plotted to over- 
throw him in order that a military party might come 
into power under which riches and glory would still 
be possibilities for ambitious men. The plot, which 
had its headquarters at Paris although it was en- 
gineered at Rennes, has remained obscure because 
it was important to Napoleon after he had been 
made First Consul for life that there should be no 
discordant note in the general pseon of praise. 
Another reason was the fact that the evidence 
pointed to Bernadotte, his own relative, as the orig- 
inator of the scheme. M. Thierry has announced 
that the book is the first of a series of studies with 
the general title of " Conspirateurs et Gens de 
Police." It is based upon papers in the National 
Archives and in the archives of the Prefecture of 
Police. It is, however, no dry-as-dust compilation.

Anyone familiar with French police archives is 
aware that dossier after dossier contains materials 
for romance, comedy, or tragedy according to the 
taste of the investigator. All the personages in- 
volved in this fiasco are described in such detail 
and yet with such a sense of the unities and the 
proportions of the story that the reader is carried 
forward with a constantly increasing interest from 
one phase of the plot to the next and so on to the 
denouement. Incidentally there are studies of such 
men as Fouchd, Bernadotte, and of Mounier. Espe- 
cially curious is the reappearance of Mounier, who 
in the early days of the Constituent Assembly had 
figured as a great statesman, but who soon sank 
hopelessly into the opposition and was later driven 
into exile. Mounier now appears as prefect of the 
department of Ille et Vilaine. On the whole the 
book is an excellent example of a form of historical 
writing that the French are doing particularly well. 

The latest volumes in Mr. Archer 
B. Hulbert's " Historic Highways " 
series (Arthur H. Clark Co., Cleve- 
land) are numbers ten and eight, issued in the order 
named. Volume ten is a re-issue, in the style of 
the series, of the author's " Old National Road," 
published in 1901. The title has been changed to 
"The Cumberland Road," this latter being the legal 
designation of the highway. The only change in 
the text seems to be the omission of the chapters 
on Washington's and Braddock's roads, which have 
been treated separately in earlier volumes of the 
series, and a slight re-arrangement of the material. 
The rather interesting " kodaks " of toll-houses, 
taverns, and mile-stones, that appeared in the orig- 
inal volume, are omitted in the reprint — perhaps 
not being regarded as sufficiently pretentious for 
the present purpose. The aim of the monograph 
is to emphasize the influence exerted by the " Old 
Pike " in uniting East and West before the era of 
the railroad. — The subject matter of volume eight 
is better indicated by its sub-title, " The Conquest 
of the Old Northwest," than by its main title, " Mil- 
itary Roads of the Mississippi Basin." The roads 
are routes, and the only pare of the Mississippi 
Basin treated is that north of the Ohio. The 
volume covers five military campaigns, — Clark's 
against Kaskaskia and Yincennes in 1778 and 1779, 
and the campaigns of Harmar, St. Clair, and Wayne 
against the northwestern Indians from 1790 to 
1794. The treatment of Clark's campaigns is con- 
fined to an examination of the routes, while of the 
other campaigns quite full accounts are given. The 
author has found most of his material in the Dra- 
per manuscripts in the library of the Wisconsin 
State Historical Society, and to this he adds a per- 
sonal examination of the territory traversed in the 
campaigns. His study of the routes is undoubtedly 
the most authoritative that has ever been made, and 
its result modifies accepted opinion in some impor- 
tant points. In the case of Clark's campaigns, he 
gives a modern map upon which he indicates their

routes. This same service should have been done 
for the various roads treated in the earlier volumes 
of the series, and for the other campaigns covered 
by this volume. Important as are these highways 
in the history of the westward movement, the pre- 
cise details of their location have little interest to 
any but the antiquarian. On this account the 
author should save the reader's time by presenting 
the results of his studies in the form most easily 
and most quickly grasped. 



Amold^s 
ezpfdilion 
to Quebec. 



It is said that Benedict Arnold once 
asked an American prisoner held in 
the British camp what the Americans 
would do with him ( Arnold ) if they should capture 
him. The prisoner replied that they would take 
off the leg that had been wounded while Arnold 
was storming the stronghold of Quebec for his 
country and bury it with the honors of war, and 
then hang the rest of his body on a traitor's gibbet. 
This story introduces an exhaustive account of the 
Quebec Expedition written by John Codman, 2nd, 
and now brought out in a third edition by Mr. Will- 
iam Abbatt, with added matter and illustrations. 
The hardship and risk connected with the attempt 
to lead a military expedition through the pathless 
forests lying between the Kennebec and Chaudiere 
rivers in 1775 can scarcely be imagined at the 
present day. It has been likened to Hannibars 
crossing the Alps. Starting with only 1100 men, 
Arnold lost fully 400 of these by death and deser- 
tion. The expedition was foredoomed to failure. 
The author of the present narrative has seized upon 
the most picturesque events of the journey, and has 
made a study of the exact route taken. Many of 
his statements were questioned, it may be remem- 
bered, by Prof. Justin H. Smith, who brought out 
a book on the same topic last year. The death of 
Mr. Codman, really before his work was complete 
for the first edition, threw the burden of a rejoinder 
upon his friends. But the task could Lave been 
undertaken only by one who had made such an in- 
timate study of the geography of the route as had 
Mr. Codman and Professor Smith. Regardless of 
details of the itinerary, the story is one of devotion, 
daring, and endurance, which makes one feel the 
possibilities of Arnold's career, if only his fidelity 
had remained unimpaired.

W<-Biem educator shaken by too close contact with the 
andphuanthroput. g^ggj ^^j^j worldliuess of this Com- 
mercial age will find an excellent tonic for his faith 
in the volume entitled "William Greenleaf Eliot: 
Minister, Educator, Philanthropist " (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.), by Mrs. Charlotte C. Eliot. This is 
a most inspiring record of a man of the highest 
spiritual and social ideals, who went in his early 
manhood from the choicest environment of the 
East to become a home missionary in the frontier 
town of St. Louis, remaining there until his death, 
fifty-three years later. Not only did he build up a 



large church but he became in many ways the first 
citizen of his city, the recognized leader in all plans 
for the general good of the community, with an 
influence extending throughout the Mississippi Val- 
ley. He never had time to become a profound 
scholar, and he had no great eloquence; but he 
gave himself heart and soul to all who needed him, 
and he w as a natural leader of men, with a genius 
for friendship. Of his many public services we can 
mention only three of the greatest. He may be 
called the founder of the public school system of 
St. Louis, for it was but a poor apology for a sys- 
tem that existed when Dr. Eliot became President 
of the School Board in 1848. He threw himself 
into this work with all his marvellous energy, and 
it was not long before the system was on a secure 
financial basis and was well organized. Dr. Eliot 
was also the founder of Washington University, 
first chartered as " Eliot Seminary " entirely without 
his knowledge. To the development of an institu- 
tion that should be " for St. Louis what Harvard 
College is to Boston, or Yale to the city of its 
abode" he gave himself with unremitting energy 
for more than thirty years, half of the time as 
Chancellor without salary. Dr. James K. Hosmer, 
who served under him, in the introduction to this 
book, bears eloquent testimony to his great service 
and his gifted personality. The third distinguished 
service, this time to the whole country, was the 
organization of the Western Sanitary Commission, 
through which four and a quarter millions of dollars 
were expended for the relief of suffering among the 
wounded and helpless. The story of Dr. Eliot's 
life was well worth telling, and it is here told with 
sympathy and skill. 

Specialized history is the order of 
the day, either in point of subject 
matter or of time. Mr. Herbert W. 
Paul has specialized in the latter sense at least in 
producing a " History of Modern England" (Mae- 
millan) that begins with 1846 and is to extend, in 
five volumes, to the end of the century. Moreover, 
a just criticism of the two volumes already issued 
must recognize that the author shows himself par- 
ticularly competent in one field only, the narration 
of purely political events in parliament and in po- 
litical campaigns. Other important topicH, such as 
religion, art, and literature are much emphasized 
by Mr. Paul in his introduction, but in the body of 
the work these are treated hurriedly and without 
the personal interest manifested in political affairs. 
Apart from this defect, however, the work is of 
real value as offering a convenient and readable 
account of modern England. The author, for some 
reason, does not specify either his earlier produc- 
tions or his present position, both of which should 
be of value in offering to the prospective American 
purchaser some means of estimating the value of 
the work. Mr. Paul has been a member of Parlia- 
ment, as a Liberal, has written a life of Gladstone, 
and a volume on Matthew Arnold for the " English

Men of Letters " series, and is a leader writer on 
the London " Daily News." He is perhaps as well 
qualified as anyone to write the only kind of his- 
tory of modern England possible at this early day, 
for he knows his parliamentary history thoroughly 
and has an acute newspaper sense of the value of 
events as they appear to a contemporaneous pub- 
lic. His history is therefore a resumS of events as 
they assumed importance in parliament and with 
the public. The second volume concludes with the 
death, in 1865, of Palmerston, for whom the author 
evinces more personal ill-will than for any other 
English statesman in the period covered. In gen- 
eral Mr. Paul does not seem to permit his political 
affiliations to bias his judgment, though Peel is 
distinctly a hero, and largely for his stand on the 
question of free trade in corn. It will be interest- 
ing to note whether Mr. Paul will attempt in the 
remaining volumes of his work to point a moral ap- 
plicable to the present interesting political situation 
in Etigland, whether, in fact, his history is a genu- 
ine historical undertaking, or a bit of political prop- 
aganda. There is nothing definitely indicative of 
the latter purpose in the volumes already published, 
but there are statements and deductions possible of 
later development. 

A year ago Dr. George M. Gould of 
Philadelphia issued a volume of 
"Biographic Clinics" (Blakiston), 
in which he ascribed to eye-strain the bodily ills of 
De Qaincey, Carlyle, Darwin, Huxley, and Brown- 
ing. This book, he now tells us, was inadequately 
and even contemptuously noticed by medical jour- 
nals, and its author charged with hobby-riding. 
Lay periodicals showed themselves more sympa- 
thetic. But, on the whole, the world has not yet 
given the subject that serious attention which Dr. 
Gould is convinced it demands. Therefore he has 
brought out, through the same publishers, a second 
volume of these clinics, treating of " the origin of 
the ill health of George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, 
Wagner, Parkman, Jane Welsh Carlyle, Spencer, 
Whittier, Margaret Fuller Ossoli, and Nietzsche." 
Of all the members that minister to the belly, the 
eyes, as we here learn in a second and fuller lesson, 
are the most potent in their influence for ill if sub- 
jected to abuse. Vomiting and sick headache, such 
as poor Mrs. Carlyle suffered from, are often the 
result of eye-strain. Heart trouble, neuralgia, dys- 
pepsia, and many other ailments, are not seldom 
attributable to the same cause. The eye, a verita- 
ble "evil eye," is the source of countless woes. 
The author declares he has never seen a pair of 
eyes free from optical defects. What, then, is to 
be done about it? Greater care must be taken of 
the eyes, and spectacles, adapted to the particular 
form of eye-ailment, must be worn, and must be 
changed with the changing of the eye. This, of 
course, presupposes the malady to be in some degree 
pronounced. The proper care of the eyes would 
usher in a new era, not only of physical, but also 



of mental well-being, if we may believe Dr. Gould. 
The effects would be manifest even in our litera- 
ture, which would become more cheerful and op- 
timistic. The earnest efforts of our oculist to hasten 
this glad time are wholly praiseworthy ; but the 
non-medical critic queries, with submission, whether 
Dr. Gould may not possibly be showing us the de- 
fects of his qualities. The zeal that tries to prove 
too much weakens the cause. It is so easy to see 
only what we are looking for if we do but set about 
it in tremendous earnest. To one wearing the 
spectacles of impartiality and unprejudice the 
author's theory, sound though it may be, seems 
strained when he makes it account for the ailments 
of so many persons, now dead, whose recorded 
groans and sighs are not exactly the fullest and 
most satisfactory data on which to base a diagnosis. 



Professor William Mathews's lat- 
^fTu^Tj' est volume, " Conquering Success" 

(Houghton), is in many respects a 
repetition of his famous "Getting On in the World." 
The veteran author has no new prescription for 
success, but insists, as he did thirty years ago, that 
it is to be won by industry, energy, patience, hon- 
esty, and several other virtues. He even repeats 
in part the words he used thirty years ago, though 
he gives his chapters new headings. But the new 
book is better than the old. The chapters are 
shorter, — a reform which young readers especially 
will appreciate, — and the whole expression is more 
terse and pointed. The new subjects considered, — 
pluck, cheerfulness, the evils of hurry, spectral dis- 
couragements, etc., — have distinctly modern appli- 
cation. And the examples which enforce the morals 
have grown in number and interest. They were 
indeed a cloud of witnesses in the old volume, but 
in the new they are as continuous as the stars that 
shine and twinkle in the Milky Way. No one, in 
history or out, has ever failed or succeeded in any- 
thing, that Mr. Mathews did not whip out his pen- 
cil and make a note. Consequently, though the 
garment of his advice is commonplace and sober 
enough, it is gayly embroidered with modern — and 
ancient — instances. It is no wonder such a book 
is popular. The young who have not yet succeeded 
like it because it marshals them the way that they 
are going. The old who have succeeded like it be- 
cause they can say " That 's so ; that 's what I did." 
The old who have not succeeded perhaps like it best 
of all, for 

" Success is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed." 

They can taste the sweets of success on the printed 
page, if nowhere else. The question which remains 
about the book in the end is, just what does Mr. 
Mathews mean by success ? Does n't he, in spite of 
a few protestations, attach rather too material a 
meaning to the term ? Possibly so. But possibly 
also his books are no less practical or popular on 
that account.

[April 16, 



Mr. George Wharton James is well 
indMndweiieri 0/ ^nown from his lectures and books 

the Painted Desert. i o i -i » i • i i 

upon the oouthwest, and for his book 
on Indian Basketry. Perhaps no one who writes 
knows the Grand CaSon of the Colorado better than 
he, and few have done as much to make the whole 
Southwestern desert known to the outside world. 
In *• The Indians of the Painted Desert Region " 
(Little, Brown & Co.) he describes and pictures the 
human native population of the area. As is natural, 
he devotes the most of his space to the Hopi (Moki) 
of Arizona, and the Navajo. But his chapters on 
the Wallapais and the Havasupais are even more 
important, as there has been little written in regard 
to these relatively inaccessible canon-dwellers. Now, 
when hundreds go annually to the Hopi snake- 
dance, and since Matthews has given us the results 
of a life-study of the Navajo, we have abundant 
information regarding these interesting peoples. But 
the Wallapais and Havasupais are in a different 
category. Mr. James is a real traveller and ex- 
plorer, and an interesting writer. While his ego is 
sometimes obtrusive, and he occasionally breaks 
down in an attempt at " fine writing," his material 
is good. He knows the Indians, sympathizes with 
and loves them — although after a somewhat pat- 
ronizing fashion, — and gives us a true picture. 
The book is a good nature-book, with a great sub- 
ject. A number of illustrations from photographs 
adds to the interest of the volume. 



Notes. 



Scientific and popular lore concern- 
jeweUand Jq- " Gems and Gem Minerals" 

their toureet. °, , * -nr »«^ r j\ • ». 

(Chicago : A. W. Mumford) is to 
be found in a recent work by Dr. 0. C Farrington 
of the Field Columbian Museum of Chicago. The 
work is very systematic, including in its scope all 
known gem minerals, not only those now used for 
gems but also others which if better known might 
come into demand as jewels. The treatment is 
scientific in that the physical and chemical prop- 
erties of the minerals are given, and their mode 
of geological occurrence and geographical distribu- 
tion is discussed ; it is popular in that the methods 
of mining, of grinding, cutting, and polishing gems 
are described, and the historical setting of the 
better-known gems and notable jewels is given. The 
popular superstitions concerning gems among vari- 
ous peoples of the Occident and orient are given at 
length, and even birth stones are assigned accord- 
ing to the lines of a well-known dealer in jewels. 
One chapter is devoted to the principles on which 
the valuation and price of gems are based, and an- 
other to imitation gems and methods of detecting 
them. The volume is abundantly illustrated with 
maps of mining regions, photographs of famous 
mines, diagrams of cut stones and crystal?, and by 
fifteen colored plates of marked excellence made 
by the colortype process. The applicability of this 
latter method of illustration to the portrayal of these 
most difiBcult of all natural objects adequately to 
picture is well demonstrated in theee plates. 



The recollections of Mme. Sarah Bernhardt are an- 
nounced for autumn publication by the Messrs. Ap- 
pleton. In the meantime portions of the work will ap- 
pear in one of the magazines. 

Mr. David Nutt is the publisher of " Gerald the 
Welshman," being a new and enlarged edition of Mr. 
Henry Owen's essay upon the life and writings of 
Giraldus Cambrensis. 

" The Merchant of Venice " has just been added by 
the Messrs. Crowell to their " First Folio " series of 
Shakespeare's plays, as edited by Misses Charlotte 
Porter and Helen A. Clarke. 

The industrious reprinter has at last got around to 
Godwin's famous novel, " Caleb Williaoas," which now 
comes to us from the Messrs. Scribner in their " Cax- 
ton " thin-paper series of famous novels. 

" Sir Arthur Sullivan," by Mr. H. Saxe Wyndham, 
and " Mozart," by Prof. Ebenezer Prout, are new biog- 
raphies in " Bell's Miniature Series of Musicians," pub- 
lished in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

To the " Grimm Library," published by Mr. David 
Nutt, there has just been added the old Irish prose-epic 
called " The Cattle-Raid of Cualnge," now translated 
for the first time by Mrs. L. Winifred Faraday. 

Pierce Egan's "The Life of an Actor," with the 
original colored illustrations by Theodore Lane, is pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Appleton in the series of reprints 
which we have frequently had occasion to mention of 
late. 

Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. announce for early 
publication a new novel by Mr. Philip Payne, author 
of " The Mills of Man." The new story is a romance 
of American hotel life, entitled " Duchess of Few 
Clothes." 

Baedeker's " Northern Germany," covering the ter- 
ritory as far as the Bavarian and Austrian frontiers, 
and his " Central Italy and Rome," each work in its 
fourteenth revised edition, are among the recent impor- 
tations of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

A new volume in Mr. John Lane's attractive and sub- 
stantial "Crown Library" is the Memoirs of Mile, des 
Eoherolles, " being side lights on the Reign of Terror," 
translated by Miss Marie Clothilde Balfour and sup- 
plied with an introduction by Mr. George K. Fortescue. 
Mr. Thomas Whittaker sends us the twelfth edition 
of Canon Gore's " Lux Mundi," the volume of essays 
by various hands that made so great a stir at the time 
of its first appearance, and that still seems to have 
something of the vitality of the earlier and more famous 
" Essays and Reviews." 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. send us two German 
texts: "Das Habichtsfiaulein," by Rudolph Baum- 
bach, edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bernhardt, and Goethe's 
" Hermann und Dorothea," edited by Dr. W. A. Adams. 
From the same publishers we have Feuillet's " Roman 
d'un Jeune Homme Pauvre," edited by Professor 
James D. Bruner. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have in press a timely 
book entitled " Russia, her Strength and her Weak- 
ness," by the well-known correspondent, Mr. Wolf von 
Schierbrand. The author has travelled widely through 
Russia, and has supplemented his impressions by a 
special study of Russian conditions and events extend- 
ing over many years.

Still another commentary upon " In Memoriam " ! 
This time the little book is the work of Dr. L. Ward, 
and is published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. This 
sort of thing seems to us of slight value. A few notes 
may be useful, but paraphrase is futile, and Dr. Ward's 
work is mainly paraphrase. 

An appropriate announcement in this centennial year 
of Hawthorne's birth is that of an edition de luxe of 
" The Scarlet Letter," to be published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. There will be 125 copies only, printed 
on Japan paper, with illustrations in color by Messrs. 
A. Romandi and C. Graham. 

"The Newcomes," in three volumes, has just been 
published by the Messrs. Scribner in their new *« Ken- 
sington" edition of Thackeray. These beautifully- 
printed volumes are a delight to every bookish sense, 
and those already published are numerous enough to 
make a stately array upon the shelf. 

Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.'s new edition of the 
Lewis and Clark Journals in their " Trail- Makers 
Series " will be followed shortly by " The Journey of 
Coronado, 1540-42, from the City of Mexico to the 
Buffalo Plains of Kansas and Nebraska," translated 
from Castaneda's " Relations " and other sources by 
Mr. George Parker Winship. 

Mr. J. S. Tunison has just published, through the 
Robert Clarke Co., a study of "The Graal Problem 
from Walter Map to Wagner." This essay upon, a 
theme of perenially fascinating interest seeks to show 
that the Grail story, in its very origin, is a memorial of 
one of the bitterest ecclesiastical struggles in history, 
and also that it is reminiscent of actual rather than of 
mythical conditions. 

The March issue of " The Burlington Magazine " 
contains the conclusion of Mr. Baillie-Grohman's arti- 
cle on " Ancient Weapons of the Chase," and the be- 
ginning of an important series on the " Minor English 
Furniture Makers of the Eighteenth Century." Other 
articles deal with the Veitch collection of Chinese por- 
celain and embroidered bindings for Bibles. There are 
several illustrations in photogravure and color. 

In addition to their extensive list of Spring books 
already announced, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
will publish within the next month or two " The Penob- 
scot Man," a volume of short stories by Mrs. Fannie 
Hardy Eckstorm; "The Ferns of New England," by 
Miss Helen Eastman; "The Christian Philosophy of 
Life," a collection of sermons by Dr. Samuel P. Leeds; 
and a new edition of Celia Thaxter's " An Island Gar- 
den." 

The success of their collotype reproduction of the 
First Folio of Shakespeare has encouraged the Oxford 
University Press to undertake the same service for a 
book of even greater rarity — the First Folio of Chau- 
cer's works, as edited by W. Thynne and printed in the 
year 1532. The facsimile will be edited, with an In- 
troduction, by the Rev. Prof. Skeat, and is limited to 
1000 copies, of which only a small proportion is avail- 
able for America. 

" Of the Making of a Book " is the title of a little 
brochure compiled by the literary department of Messrs. 
D. Appletou & Co., and published by that firm. It is 
planned to serve as an aid to authors, and its advice in 
regard to preparation of manuscript, proof-reading, etc., 
cannot fail to prove of the greatest value. Somewhat 
similar in kind, though in this case intended primarily 
for the printer rather than the author, is the booklet of 



« Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University 
Press, Oxford." Mr. Horace Hart, Director of the 
Press, is responsible for these rules, while the English 
spellings adopted have the additional authority of Drs. 
J. A. H. Murray and Henry Bradley. No more accu- 
rate or painstaking printing establishment exists today 
than the Oxford concern, and (of course with due allow- 
ance for differences between English and American 
standards) its rulings may safely be accepted by any 
printer or author. 

Among other articles in the April number of " The 
Hibbert Journal " Prof. Henry Jones writes on " The 
Moral Aspect of the Fiscal Question," dealing with a 
side of the subject that has, perhaps, not received as 
much attention as it deserves. Sir Oliver Lodge con- 
tributes some " Suggestions towards the Re-interpreta- 
tion of Christian Doctrine"; and Canon Hensley Hen- 
son writes on " The Resurrection of Jesus Christ," and 
the Bishop of Ripon on "Gladstone as a Moral and 
Religious Personality." 

Under the designation of "The Chiswick Quartos" 
the Scott-Thaw Co. will begin publication this spring 
of a series of reprints in quarto form, choicely printed 
at the Chiswick Press, London, in editions limited to 
350 copies each. Keats's poems, edited by Mr. George 
Sampson, and Herbert's " The Temple " will be the 
first to appear. To their " Library of Noble Authors " 
the same firm will shortly add a folio reprint of the 
" Golden Ass " of Apuleius, in William Adlington's 
translation. 

Two volumes to be issued immediately by the Uni- 
versity of Chicago Press are " An Introduction to the 
Bible for Teachers of Children," by Miss Georgia L. 
Chamberlin, and " A Political and Constitutional Study 
of the Cumberland Road," by Mr. Jeremiah S. Young. 
Early in May the Press will have ready Dr. George E. 
Howard's important " History of Matrimonial Insti- 
tutions," and in June will appear a volume of " Studies 
in the Gospel according to Mark," by Dr. Ernest De- 
Witt Burton. 

The war in the East lends new interest and perti- 
nence to Mrs. Hugh Fraser's charming " Letters from 
Japan," now published in a single volume containing the 
complete text and all the illustrations of the original 
two-volume edition. The war is responsible also for 
the appearance of new editions of Mr. Wirt Gerrare's 
"Greater Russia" and Mr. Archibald R. Colquhoun's 
" The Mastery of the Pacific," both of which, so far as 
we can judge, remain unchanged in form and contents. 
All three of these books bear the imprint of the Mac- 
millan Co. 

The American edition, limited to 100 copies, of the 
reproduction of the celebrated " Breviario Grimani " 
has been secured by Mr. Martinus Nijhoff, New York, 
and the work may be obtained in this country only 
through him. The reproduction is probably one of 
the most elaborate enterprises of the kind ever under- 
taken. There will be twelve parts in all, each contain- 
ing twenty-five plates in color and 110 in collotype, 
accompanied by the descriptive text of Dr. Sal. Mor- 
purgo. It is not likely that the work will be completed 
inside of six or eight years. 

Dr. Horace Howard Furness, Sr., is rapidly com- 
pleting the preparation of " Love's Labor Lost," which 
is to be the next volume in his monumental "Vario- 
rum " Shakespeare, of which the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
are the publishers. This new volume comes from the

hands of Dr. Farness, Sr., in accordance with the plan 
for a division of work, announced a few months ago, 
by which the editorship of the comedies in the " Vario- 
rum " edition will continue to he the work of the elder 
Dr. Furness, while the other plays will be edited by 
his son. Dr. Horace Howard Furness, Jr. 

One of the most interesting announcements in con- 
nection with the Lewis and Clark centenary is that of 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.'s reprint of the Journal 
of Patrick Gass, one of the party composing the Lewis 
and Clark expedition. This work originally appeared 
in 1807, and ran through three editions, the third dated 
1811, but no reprint has been made since the some- 
what crude edition published at Dayton, Ohio, in 1847, 
which has long been out of print. Messrs. McClurg's 
edition will be in one volume, uniform with their re- 
prints of the Lewis and Clark Journals and Hennepin's 
Travels, and will be provided with a new Analytical 
Index and an Introduction written by Dr. James K. 
Hosmer. The volume will be illustrated with facsimi- 
les of the six quaint pictures in the original edition, a 
portrait of Gass, and a map of the Lewis and Clark 
route. Messrs. MeClurg & Co. will issue in the early 
Fall, in uniform style, a reprint of Lahontan's Travels, 
edited by Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites, and illustrated 
with facsimiles of the original illustrations.

When Wilderness Was King 

A Tale of the Illinois Country. By RANDALL PARRISH 

With six Pictures in full Color by the KINNEYS. 



•' It is decidedly in keeping that the most powerful novel of 
to-day concerning the West should be written by a Western man 
and published by a Western firm. ' When Wilderness was King ' 
is like a great cyclone sweeping us along in the mighty current of 
the story, regardless of whether we like that sort or not, pinning 
our attention firmly to its pages and only releasing us when the 
last line is finished. The most hardened reader will enjoy the 
sweet, sympathetic love story embedded like a vein of gold in the 
rough but vigorous surroundings, which bring out its delicacy and 
worth." — Philadelphia Item. 

" Never was book more fittingly bound, more charmingly 
illustrated, or more perfectly printed than this first book by 
a talented Illinois author. Not since the ' Leatherstocking 
Tales ' has there been such a story of border warfare. * fFhen 
ffiUerriess ivas King ' is entitled to rank as a classic." — Chicago 
yournal. 

" It is a long time since we have had so genuine a return to 
the days of the Cooper novel." — Minneapolis Times. 



" But first and foremost it is a story — a full-blooded, moving, 
vigorous American story. John Wayland's love story is one of 
the finest of its kind we have read — and John and the glorious 
Toinnette are well worth knowing. ... It is the finest book of 
fiction from a mechanical standpoint ever turned out by an Amer- 
ican publishing house." — St. Paul Dispatch. 

"A tale of unusual picturesqueness, romantic interest and 
dramatic vigor. The action never halts, the characters are of the 
red-blood frontier type, with enough contrast and variety not to 
be monotonous ; the romantic element, which is the backbone of 
the story, is charming, and through all runs a thread of mystery 
that one is slow to drop until he has followed it to the end." — 
Minneapolis yournal. 

" The book is sure of a large demand, for John Wayland, big, 
powerful, resourceful, a mighty man in fight or toil, is a worthy 
hero, while Toinnette, sweet, shy, bafHing, and true of heart, is 
as dainty and winsome a heroine as one could wish to find." — 
Salt Lake City Tribune.

SECOND EDITION APRIL 25 



Robert Cavelier 

The Romance of the Sieur de La Salle and his Discovery of the Mississippi 
By WILLIAM DANA ORCUTT 

With six Pictures in Tint by CHARLOTTE WEBER. 



" The materials for his story being fortunately of great variety 
and interest, Mr. Orcutt has chosen from them wisely and has 
woven them into a narrative which has all the verisimilitude of 
biography and all the romance of fiction. Historical personages 
and imaginary characters move hither and thither through the 
pages, but they all center around the great personage of La Salle." 
— Boston Traveler. 

" We are won by Robert Cavelier early in the book, where as 
a novice in the Holy Order of Jesus, he fearlessly declared that he 
must turn back from the course which would lead him to full 
membership in the order, and faced the wrath of the superior of 
the house. We are attracted to Anne Courcelle with the first 
glimpse of her in the frontispiece and we are not disappointed in 
the development of her character in succeeding pages." — Minne- 
apolis yournal. 



" Mr. Orcutt has a fine hero in La Salle, whose story needs 
little turning from its veritable course. The contests with the 
Jesuits, the return to France where La Salle found Mile. Cour- 
celle at the court of the king, the later explorations, the treachery 
of La Salle's brother, and the rescue of Fort Frontenac are stir- 
ring incidents in a dramatic story." — The Christian Register. 

" The publishers have spared no effort to give the volume 
dignity and attractiveness. The typography and decorations are 
in keeping with the dignity of form, and the half-dozen illustra- 
tions by Charlotte Weber are worthy of special commendation." 
— Cle-veland Plain Dealer. 

" In its mechanical aspect the volume is a gem, its ornamental 
initials, head-pieces, and full-page illustrations being executed with 
rare artistic finish." — Chicago Record-Herald. 



Aside from the interest of the stories themselves the mechanical details of both of these books are 
so unusually distinguished that they deserve a place in every library, private or public, for that reason 
alone, aside from any other considerations.

1904] THE DIAL 279 

Two Notable and Timely Additions 
to McClurg's Americana Series 



READY EARLY SUMMER 

GASS'S JOURNAL 

OF 

The Lewis and Clark Expedition 

Reprinted from the edition of i8ii, with an Introduction by 
Dr. JAMES K. HOSMER, an analytical Index, facsimiles of 
the 7 original illustrations, a rare portrait of Patrick Gass, and a 
map of the Lewis and Clark route. 

The appearance of this volume in the year of Lewis and Clark celebrations is especially pertinent, 
as no practical library edition has been available of the "Journal of Patrick Gass." The work 
originally appeared in 1807, and ran through three editions, the third dated 181 1, but no reprint 
has been made since the somewhat crude edition published at Dayton, Ohio, in 1847, which has, 
of course, long been out of print. Aside from its actual historical value, it is a volume of unusual 
interest, containing, as the old title-page says, " an authentic relation of the most interesting tran- 
sactions during the expedition ; a description of the country ; an account of its inhabitants, soil, 
climate, curiosities, and vegetable and animal productions." 

In one crown 8vo volume^ about J2^ poges^ uniform in size and binding with 
McClurg's library reprints of *■*■ Lewis and Clark'* and '■'■Hennepin's A New 
Discovery" Price $3.50 net. Delivered, $3.70. 

Large-paper edition on Brown's handmade paper, illustrations on fapan paper, 
limited to 100 copies. $10.00 net. 



READY EARLY FALL 

LAHONTAN'S 

New Voyages to North America 

Reprinted from the English edition of 1703, with\facsimiles of 
original title-pages, and 24. maps and illustrations, and the addition 
of Introduction, Notes, and analytical Index, by REUBEN GOLD 
THWAITES, Editor of "Hennepin's A New Discovery," etc. 

The selection of the famous writings of Baron Lahontan for republication is a natural one after 
the success of the reprint of Hennepin issued last year. It is a logical step in the preparation of 
the Americana series planned by Messrs. McClurg & Co., and the appearance of Lahontan's 
Voyages in a standard library edition will be as welcome as that of the preceding volumes. Like 
the Hennepin, it is a word-for-word reprint. 

In two volumes, uniform in si%e and binding with the preceding works in this 
series, and with Bibliography by Victor Hugo Paltsits. Price $6.00 net; deliv- 
ered $6.40.

How the dog has his day and how, 
springing from the day of the dog, a

QUOTATION VE RSUS ORIGINALITY. 

The reproach is often brought against mod- 
ern essayists that the substance of their writ- 
ing is quotation, and only the dressing original. 
A patchwork of extracts is indeed a pitiful 
thing. Where the excerpts from Bartlett or 
Allibone stand shivering in a scantiness of 
drapery that is next to nudity, it is evident 
that the cobbler (to vary the metaphor) has 
erred in choosing for his medium of expression 
literature instead of leather. But the apt use 
of another's words, the knowing just where to 
go for the immortal phrasing of a turn of 
thought, the graceful giving place to a supe- 
rior where an attempt at originality would 
argue presumption as well as ignorance, and 
the skilful weaving of the borrowed material 
into the fabric of one's discourse, — this it is 
that marks the man of letters, the litterateur. 

Illustrations are hardly necessary ; but let 
us suppose, for example, the case of a writer 
who has the hardihood to offer the world an- 
other essay on Milton. Let it be further 
assumed that, departing somewhat from the 
beaten track, he undertakes to expose, briefly 
and pointedly, the weakness of Milton's " Doc- 
trine and Discipline of Divorce." He sees at 
a glance that its assailable side is its supreme 
disregard of the wife's interests. Imagine, 
says our writer, the case of a man who has a 
weakness for a succession of wives — a private 
Henry the Eighth. He marries No. 1, and 
after a while, on the plea that he finds her 
incompatible, he avails himself of Milton's 
law and gives her a bill of divorcement. No. 2 
succeeds to the vacant place, and is ere long 
treated in like manner; and so on, till the 
brutal rascal, undeniably exempt from all legal 
censure, may be living in the centre of a per- 
fect solar system of discarded wives, all mov- 
ing in nearer or farther orbits around him^ 
according to the times, more recent or more 
remote, when they were thrown off, and each 
attended by her one or more satellites of little 
darlings. Is that about as graphic and force- 
ful a presentation of his case as our essayist 
could have made ? If you say it is, you com- 
mend his wisdom in adopting Professor Mas- 
son's humorously effective image instead of

employing a less striking illustration and a 
feebler phraseology of his own — provided, of 
course, that he fails not to name his authority 
and to use the required quotation marks, which 
have here been purposely omitted. Not to 
have cited the eminent Edinburgh scholar at 
this point would almost have argued ignorance 
of his work. 

A writer is characterized nearly as much by 
his quotations as by his own composition. If 
he quotes learnedly, we know him to be a 
scholar. If his quotations bite and sting, he 
is a satirist. If he quotes indiscriminately and 
inaptly, that too is characteristic: it stamps 
him as lacking in clean-cut, positive ideas of 
his own. The bungler's borrowings always 
betray him. His foreign matter is rather sug- 
gestive of the crude lumps in a piece of Rox- 
bury pudding-stone than of the delicate veining 
in a slab of polished marble. But the man of 
genius makes his own all that he takes from 
others. " What would remain of me," asks 
Goethe, " if this art of appropriation were 
derogatory to genius? Every one of my writ- 
ings has been furnished to me by a thousand 
different persons, a thousand things : wise and 
foolish bave brought me, without suspecting 
it, the offering of their thoughts, faculties, and 
experience. My work is an aggregation of 
beings taken from the whole of nature ; it 
bears the name of Goethe." 

Man, it has been well said, is a quotation 
from all his ancestors. Eliminate the quota- 
tions and you reduce him to less than the 
shadow of a shade. But in the power of 
assimilating the appropriated matter, so far at 
least as literature is concerned, there are many 
degrees of difference. As the metaphor pleases 
more than the labored simile, so the literary 
allusion, the veiled citation, the apt word or 
phrase, whether from a familiar source or 
from one half-forgotten, stimulate the flagging 
interest more than paragraphs and pages of 
direct quotation. The writings of beginners 
and of the unscholarly are painfully bare of 
these literary trimmings. Subtle allusion and 
illuminative reference glare by their absence. 
If attempt is made to relieve the bareness by 
an occasional bit of jewelry, the artifice is too 
obvious and so defeats its end. We seem to 
see the self-congratulatory smile with which 
the writer contemplates his imported finery. 
It is not meant, of course, that the expert in 
this art is necessarily in constant practice of 
it. Thackeray rarely quotes; but when he 
does, it is admirably to the purpose. Recall 



that little scene at Rawdon Crawley's club 
just after Rawdon had been appointed gov- 
ernor of Coventry Island. "A virtuous woman 
is a crown to her husband," says Brown to 
Smith in enigmatical explanation of Lord 
Steyne's action in obtaining the appointment 
for the husband of Becky Sharp. It is doubt- 
ful if Solomon's wisdom has ever been turned 
to a droller use. Another admirable but rather 
wicked biblical quotation, suggested by the 
foregoing, is that recorded of young Calverley 
who, having eluded the pursuit of a university 
proctor and his myrmidons and reached sanc- 
tuary by a bold feat of climbing, called back 
in triumph from within : " I have run through 
a troop, and by my God have I leaped over a 
wall." 

The very familiarity of a quotation, as in the 
instances just cited, is often its best feature. 
A new and fitting application of the old is more 
generally pleasing than the employment, how- 
ever skilful, of the far-fetched and unfamiliar. 
We experience nearly as much joy in finding a 
new place for an old saying as in the discovery 
of a new thought. Yet we demand that the cur- 
rent coin of wisdom shall receive constant addi- 
tions from the mint ; and effectively to employ 
the unfamiliar in quotation, so that it shall 
ever afterward be quoted, requires genius little 
inferior to that of original production. Many 
will read an author before one thinks of making 
the happy quotation ; but as soon as this is done 
the passage or phrase is immortalized. The 
good quoter shows that exquisite appreciation 
of literary charm which is so often affected, so 
seldom felt. He knows what it is both to exult 
in the one best word and to find delight in the 
daintily pliant sentence embellished with all 
sorts of felicitous linking of figure to abstrac- 
tion. He is quick to feel the glow and thrill 
imparted by the perfect utterance of & prim&ry 
truth, the voicing of " what oft was thought but 
ne'er so well expressed." Those who profess 
a hatred of " mere literature," who think that a 
writer's style, like Thomson's Lavinia, " when 
unadorned is adorned the most," will cry out 
that all this is mischievous moonshine, the 
quintessence of effeminate dilettanteism, and 
subversive of all that is vigorous and virile in 
literary art. It may be made so, as every right 
principle is capable of abuse. The Corinthian 
column may display such elaborate ingenuity 
of deeply-cut fluting and scroll-work and acan- 
thus leaves, in shaft and capital, as to make one 
fear for its strength. Montaigne was justified 
in li\« score for rhetoricians who " go a mile out

of their way to run after a fine word." Fine 
writing for its own sake no sensible person will 
seek to defend. But those who, in contempt 
of rhetorical embellishment, aim at unadorned 
literalness of presentation too often fail to put 
forth an idea worth contemplating, a thought 
worth the thinking ; striving to be plain, they 
cease to be impressive, and thus defeat their 
own purpose. 

This unwillingness to make oneself avowedly 
a debtor to earlier writers is entertained only 
by those whose acquaintance with literature is 
so restricted that they fail to perceive how few 
of their own ideas have not already been admir- 
ably minted by other minds. They are blissfully 
unconscious of the impossibility of breaking 
entirely away from what has been said and 
thought before them. They should ponder 
the words of the elder Disraeli : " Whatever is 
felicitously expressed risks being worse ex- 
pressed. It is a wretched taste to be gratified 
with mediocrity when the excellent lies before 
us." They need to bear in mind Sir Joshua 
Reynolds's warning to the students of the Eoyal 
Academy. What he has to say about origi- 
nality in painting applies equally well to the 
other arts, and to literature not least of all. 

*' Invention is little more than a new combination of 
those images which have been previously gathered and 
deposited in the memory — nothing can come of noth- 
ing; he who has laid up no materials can produce no 
combinations. Those who attempt production without 
such previous knowledge are always anticipated, and 
differ only in eccentricities. The more extensive, there- 
fore, your acquaintance is with the works of those who 
have excelled, the more extensive will be your powers 
of invention; and, what may appear still more a para- 
dox, the more original will be your conception." 

♦' Let the sticklers for originality," writes an 
anonymous commentator on this lecture, **■ the 
devotees of the new in any of its preposterous 
shapes, ponder these often-quoted words; and 
let us that have free souls and unwrung withers 
hold firmly by that allusive and quoting habit 
to which is due so much of excellence in the 
verse of Virgil, Milton, and Tennyson, in the 
prose of Addison, Burton, and Montaigne." 

The natural relation between a quotable style 
and a fondness for quoting has often been noted. 
Here seems to apply the Golden Rule : quote 
others if you would have others quote you. 
Emerson, Thoreau, Lowell, all of them utterers 
of " stamped sentences," are generous quoters. 
Their neighbor and contemporary, Hawthorne, 
very rarely quotes and is still more rarely 
quoted. His pages, free from borrowed gems 
and offering none to the would-be borrower. 



recall the lament in the "Curiosities of Liter- 
ature," — that *' the greater part of our writers 
have become so original that no one cares to 
imitate them." The author further notes with 
approval the continued vogue of Plutarch, 
Seneca, and the elder Pliny, all of whom in 
their literary work drew on the riches of their 
libraries ; while Epicurus, who boasted of hav- 
ing written three hundred books without bor- 
rowing, has perished. 

Apart from the literary charm of apt quota- 
tion, apart from the fact that when once a 
thought has been perfectly expressed our alle- 
giance to the best will tolerate nothing inferior, 
and we demand that this recognized best form, 
which haunts our own minds, shall be at least 
suggested if not reproduced in detail by the 
author we are reading, — apart from all this, 
there are certain uses of quotation which sel- 
dom fail to please and of which a brief mention 
will here suffice. The timely recital of the 
ipsissima verba of an eager antagonist, when 
this can be done in such wise as to refute him 
out of his own mouth, always wins applause. 
So also we relish the unexpected and adroit 
use of a writer's or speaker's words to enforce 
an argument quite different from that which 
they originally strengthened. The skilful in- 
terweaving of a prose quotation in the lines of 
one's verse, so as to make the borrowed phrase 
or sentence fall into metre and rhyme with the 
rest, is another amusing device ; while the em- 
ployment of a line of poetry to lend dignity 
and elevation to one's prose, is an expedient of 
every-day adoption. Finally, the desire to give 
utterance to sentiments that we secretly cherish, 
but shrink from heartily and openly avowing, 
affords still another use for quotation. Behind 
the friendly shelter of inverted commas, we in- 
dulge in satire with Pope and in cynicism with 
La Rochefoucauld. Somewhat akin to this 
practice is the putting into the mouth of an 
imaginary character such products of one's wit 
or fancy as an author wishes to make more 
impressive, or less the expression of his own 
mind, than he imagines they would be if uttered 
in the first person. 

Understanding the word " classical " in its 
broader application, we would say in conclu- 
sion, as Johnson said to Wilkes when the latter 
expressed his opinion that the habit of quoting 
was a mark of pedantry, — "No, sir, it is a 
good thing ; there is a community of mind in it. 
Classical quotation is the parole of literary men 

all over the world. " „ t' t>

The Spencer Aut obiographt.* 
After several delays and postponements, the 
autobiography of Herbert Spencer has at last 
made its appearance, and the reader's appetite, 
already whetted by the fragments that the pub- 
lishers have previously allowed to escape from 
confinement, is free to indulge itself to the full. 
The work is in two volumes, aggregating nearly 
thirteen hundred pages, provided with portraits 
of the author and of several of his relatives, to- 
gether with other illustrations explanatory of 
certain mechanical inventions of his devising. 
The main body of the work was put into type 
about fifteen years ago, and of the plates then 
made a few impressions were taken which "a 
select few" of the author's friends were per- 
mitted to read. A few years later a supple- 
mentary chapter was prepared, bringing the nar- 
rative down to 1894. At this date, the author 
penned a brief preface, of which the following 
is the opening paragraph : 

«• It has seemed to me that a natural history of my- 
self would be a useful accompaniment to the books 
which it has been the chief occupation of my life to 
write. In the following chapters I have attempted 
to give such a natural history. That I have fully 
succeeded is not to be supposed; but perhaps I have suc- 
ceeded partially. At any rate, one significant truth has 
been made clear — that in the genesis of a system of 
thought the emotional nature is a large factor: perhaps 
as large a factor as the intellectual nature." 

With these words we are introduced to a hu- 
man document of extraordinary interest, the 
intimate record of a great thinker's life. The 
book is the most important of the present year, 
one of the, most important of many years. 

It was in 1886 that failing health turned 
Spencer's activities from the more formal work 
of his life to the less exacting task of autobi- 
ography. He had already set down some mem- 
oranda for such a purpose, and "gradually 
fell into the habit of passing a little time daily 
in putting these into shape." He began with 
an account of his early life and education, 
then passed to the record of his later years, 
and afterwards filled in the gap that had been 
left between. The reasons why he thought it 
best to make the publication of the work post- 
humous are thus stated : 

« As the work advanced I became conscious that a 
constitutional lack of reticence is displayed throughout 
it, to an extent which renders present publication un- 
desirable. In years to come, when I shall be no longer

umes. Illustrated. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



conscious, the frankness with which the book is written 
may add to whatever value it has; but while I am alive 
it would, I think, be out of taste to address the public 
as though it consisted of personal friends." 

These words indicate what is perhaps the most 
characteristic feature of the book. Frankness 
is in it everywhere apparent, carried some- 
times almost to the point of naivete ; the wish 
of the writer to be absolutely honest, both 
with others and with himself, is noticeable 
throughout, and in this respect the autobiog- 
raphy is more striking than that of Mill, with 
which we naturally compare it, although it has 
not the literary grace of that intensely inter- 
esting record. 

After devoting something like seventy pages 
to his extraction and immediate antecedents, 
the author turns to the story of his own early 
years. His childish associations were nearly 
all of a most serious nature ; on the intellec- 
tual side, they were largely determined by the 
fact that he was descended from a family de- 
voted to the profession of teaching, on the 
religious side, they might be described as the 
product of Methodist influences mitigated by 
Quakerism. We find the boy Herbert much 
given to dreams and castle-building, deeply 
affected by the beauty of nature, with a pro- 
nounced bent for scientific studies, and an 
equally pronounced aversion to linguistic pur- 
suits. It is a not insignificant fact that the 
first book read by him of his own accord was 
"Sandford and Merton," which he perused at 
the age of seven. Of his childish tendency to 
castle- building he says : 

•' In early days the habit was such that on going to 
bed, it was a source of satisfaction to me to think I 
should be able to lie for a length of time and dwell on 
the fancies which at the time occupied me, and fre- 
quently next morning, on awaking, I was vexed with 
myself because I had gone to sleep before I had rev- 
elled in my imaginations as much as I had intended. 
Often these dreams, becoming literally day-dreams, 
quite filled my consciousness when walking." 

If it is something of a surprise to us to learn 
of the traits of character already mentioned, 
it is still more startling to be told how the 
boy of thirteen rebelled against the restraints 
of school and the irksomeness of the Latin 
grammar to the point of running away and 
tramping more than a hundred miles homeward 
with two shillings in his pocket at the start. 
This is quite another Herbert Spencer from 
the one we have hitherto known, and makes 
us hesitate about accepting the poet's claim 
that the child is father of the man. 

We recognize more clearly the Spencer of 
our preconception in a remark made concern-

is^ 



ing the first months, spent in London, of his 
engineering career. It is the boy of eighteen 
who, during this six months' sojourn in the 
capital, " never went to a place of amusement, 
nor ever read a novel or other work of light 
literature," but instead spent his evenings 
drawing, calling upon friends, and rambling 
about the streets. These engineering years 
must be passed over briefly. They are more 
interesting for their extraneous memories and 
reflections than for their professional achieve- 
ments. Thus, we note with interest that the 
reading of Lyell's " Geology," at twenty, only 
strengthened his opposition to the doctrine of 
fixed types for which Lyell then argued, but 
which that geologist was afterwards to be so ef- 
fective in overthrowing. We are also interested 
to note the restlessness of mind which succes- 
sively attracted Spencer's attention to subjects 
so diverse as phrenology, phonography, and 
politics — the latter of these preoccupations 
leading to a series of newspaper letters on 
"The Proper Sphere of Government," a col- 
lection of opinions in which his philosophy 
of " Social Statics " was gradually taking 
shape. Significant of much in Spencer's later 
development is his reported observation of 
"how needful analytical intelligence is in 
cases where a question of right and wrong is 
raised out of the daily routine." It is indeed 
true, as he goes on to say, that " the moral 
sentiments, however strong they may be, and 
however rightly they may guide in the ordinary 
relations of life, need enlightenment where the 
problems are complex." Of much curious 
interest is also the following passage from a 
letter of 1848 : 

" I feel more and more determined to write a poem 
in a few years hence, and am gradually working out 
the plot in my mind and putting down memoranda of 
thought and sentiment. The title I intend to be < The 
Angel of Truth,' Inclosed I send you a few lines by 
way of specimen of a first attempt. They are supposed 
to be part of the winding-up of a meditation upon the 
state of the world during the Dark Ages." 

Still another literary project was " The Rebel," 
a drama " exhibiting the failure and disap- 
pointment of a high-minded hero, consequent 
on the weakness and baseness of those with 
whom he acted." 

The tentative period of Spencer's life was 
ended when, in 1848, he went to London to 
join forces with " The Economist." From this 
time on, he was to devote himself to literary 
work in one form or another, and to develop 
the system of thought with which his name will 
forever be associated. One-third of the auto- 



biography has been covered when we reach the 
end of these years of varied occupations and 
uncertain aims. Summing them all up, the 
author finds little to regret in their seeming 
dissipation of energy. They brought him much 
knowledge of nature and of men, they strength- 
ened his " faculty of seizing cardinal truths 
rather than of accumulating detailed informa- 
tion." There had been nothing that was aca- 
demic in the discipline of these years ("I 
never passed an examination ; nor could I have 
passed any such examinations as are commonly 
prescribed "), but their discipline had been 
none the less effective. They had given clear 
evidence of both his strength and his limita- 
tions. The latter appear plainly enough in 
what he says of such matters as music, poetry, 
and philosophy. Although music served him 
as a recreation during much of his life, he 
found his ideal of dramatic musical composi- 
tion in Meyerbeer ; he listened with slight pleas- 
ure to " Don Giovanni " and was for the first 
time completely satisfied when he heard " Les 
Huguenots." In poetry, Shelley first attracted 
him, and for a time held him strongly, but in 
later life had no power to charm. Wordsworth- 
seemed to him " not wine but beer," and Dante- 
" a gorgeous dress ill made up." What hes 
thought of Homer is thus expressed : 

"My feeling was well shown when, some twenty 
years ago, I took up a translation of the < Iliad ' for the 
purpose of studying the superstitions of the early 
Greeks, and, after reading some six books, felt what a 
task it would be to go on — felt that I would rather 
give a large sum than read to the end." 

If he felt thus toward the great poet, he would 
naturally have small sympathy for the lesser 
ones, and concerning them he expresses him- 
self in vigorous language. 

<' As for the versifiers and the minor poets, they da 
little more than help to drown good literature in a 
flood of bad. There is something utterly wearisome 
in this continually working- up afresh the old materials 
into slightly different forms — talking continually of 
skies and stars, of seas and streams, of trees and flow- 
ers, sunset and sunrise, the blowing of breezes and the 
singing of birds, etc., — now describing these familiar 
things themselves, and now using them in metaphors 
that are worn threadbare. The poetry commonly pro- 
duced does not bubble up as a spring but is simply 
pumped up ; and pumped-up poetry is not worth reading." 

The conclusion of all this is that "no one 
should write verse if he can help it " — an ex- 
cellent counsel of admonition. " Let him sup- 
press it if possible ; but if it bursts forth in 
spite of him it may be of value." 

Spencer's limitations upon the side of aes- 
thetic appreciation are so evident throughout

his writings as to need no argument. Although 
he often wrote in dogmatic manner upon such 
subjects as poetry and music and literary style, 
what he said about them served to make pain- 
fully apparent the fact that it would have been 
better for his reputation had he left them un- 
touched. Much the same, thing must be said 
of his excursions into the field of philosophy, 
although this will be taken as a hard saying 
by those who are accustomed to think of him 
as one of the greatest of philosophers. But 
the contention may safely be rested upon these 
words spoken of a really great philosopher : 

" I found in Mr. Wilson's house a copy of a transla- 
tion of Kant's ' Critique of Pure Reason,' at that time, 
I believe, recently published. This I commenced read- 
ing, but did not go far. The doctrine that Time and 
Space are * nothing but ' subjective forms, — pertain ex- 
clusively to consciousness and have nothing beyond con- 
.sciousness answering to them, — I rejected at once and 
.-absolutely ; and having done so, went no further. . . . 
"There was, in the first place, the utter incredibility of 
ithe proposition itself; and then, in the second place, 
tthere was the want of confidence in the reasonings of 
anyone who could accept a proposition so incredible. 
. . . Whenever, in later years, I have taken up Kant's 
' Critique of Pure Reason,' I have similarly stopped 
short after rejecting its primary proposition." 

This, it will be observed, is not the report of a 
youthful prejudice, but the statement of a ma- 
tured and lifelong opinion — if " opinion " we 
may style this deliberate unwillingness to grap- 
ple with the thought of the most profound 
thinker of the modern world. We make these 
remarks, with their accompanying extract, in 
the interests of exact definition, and not with 
the intention of minimizing Spencer's splendid 
achievement in his own sphere of scientific co- 
ordination. 

When the " Social Statics " was produced at 
the age of thirty, Spencer's Lehrjahre were 
over, and his Wanderjahre as well, except as 
his physical needs impelled him to seek rest 
and recreation in travel. He was no longer 
driven from pillar to post as the consequence 
of his engineering and other occupations, and 
had definitely settled down to the life of the 
student, the collector of facts, and the synthetic 
thinker. From this time on, the record of his 
life is essentially an account of the circum- 
stances under which his successive works were 
produced, and an exposition of the manner in 
which his fundamental ideas were shaped. 
Space does not permit of our following this 
exposition step by step, although a review of 
broader scope would find therein one of the 
most interesting of tasks. In place of such 
detailed analysis, we quote a passage of great 



significance in the light which it throws upon 
his mental processes. George Eliot once ex- 
pressed to him her surprise that there should 
be no lines of thought on his forehead. The 
following bit of dialogue ensued : 

" < I suppose it is because I am never puzzled.' 
<0! that's the most arrogant thing I ever heard 
uttered.' 

' Not at all, when you know what I mean.' " 

And then Spencer proceeds to explain what he 
means : 

" It has never been my way to set before myself a 
problem and puzzle out an answer. The conclusions at 
which I have from time to time arrived, have not been 
arrived at as solutions of questions raised : but have been 
arrived at unawares — each as the ultimate outcome pf 
a body of thoughts which slowly grew from a germ. 
Some direct observation, or some fact met with in read- 
ing, would dwell with me: apparently because I had a 
sense of its significance. It was not that there arose 
a distinct consciousness of its general meaning; but 
rather that there was a kind of instinctive interest in 
those facts which have general meanings. . . . And 
thus, little by little, in unobtrusive ways, without con- 
scious intention or appreciable efPort, there would grow 
up a coherent and organized theory. Habitually the 
process was one of slow, unforced development, often 
extending over years; and it was, I believe, because the 
thinking done went on in this gradual, almost spontane- 
ous way, without strain, that there was an absence of 
those lines of thought which Miss Evans remarked — 
an absence almost as complete thirty years later, 
notwithstanding the amount of thinking done in the 
interval." 

This is an extraordinarily illuminating state- 
ment, and helps us to understand the organic 
solidity of the synthetic philosophy, as well as 
the fact that its author contrived for over half 
a century to do battle with ill health, and resist 
collapse, while at the same time pursuing his 
intellectual purposes with moderate but aston- 
ishingly persistent activity. 

Before closing this review, we will take occa- 
sion to reproduce, without any special attempt 
at orderly sequence, a few of the more striking 
and characteristic passages of the autobiog- 
raphy. All students of the history of education 
are familiar with Spencer's singularly biassed 
view of the relative value of the several educa- 
tional disciplines, as well as with the mischief 
that his opinion has wrought in educational 
practice. How utterly blind and deaf he was 
to the appeal of humanistic culture may be 
shown by quoting these words on the study of 
the ancient classics: 

"To think that after these thousands of years of 
civilization, the prevailing belief should still be that 
while knowledge of his own nature, bodily and mental, 
and of the world physical and social in which he has to 
live, is of no moment to a man, it is of great moment 
that he should master the languages of two extinct

peoples and become familiar with their legends, battles, 
and superstitions, as well as the achievements, mostly 
sanguinary, of their men, and the crimes of their gods ! 
Two local groups of facts and fictions, filling a rela- 
tively minute space in the genesis of a World which is 
itself but an infinitesimal part of the Universe, so occupy 
students that they leave the World and the Universe 
unstudied ! Had Greece and Rome never existed, 
human life, and the right conduct of it, would have 
been in their essentials exactly what they now are: 
survival or death, health or disease, prosperity or ad- 
versity, happiness or misery, would have been just in 
the same ways determined by the adjustment or non- 
adjustment of actions to requirements." 

" Had Greece and Rome never existed, human 
life, and the right conduct of it [we add the 
italics], would have been in their essentials 
exactly what they now are" — in the presence 
of so amazing an expression of Philistinism 
as this, we can only gasp for breath, and mar- 
vel at the warped view which it indicates, at 
its reckless disregard of one of the elementary 
truths of history. 

Among Spencer's many characterizations of 
his famous contemporaries, those of Ruskin, 
Carlyle, and Mill are particularly interesting. 
When he read "Modern Painters," he was 
delighted to find a critic of art who was dar- 
ing enough to speak unfavorably of Raphael, 
but when he opened " The Stones of Venice," 
his delight was transformed into something 
quite different. 

"My faith in Mr. Ruskin's judgment was at once 
destroyed ; and thereafter I paid no further attention to 
his writings than was implied by reading portions quoted 
in reviews or elsewhere. These, joined with current 
statements about his sayings and doings, sufficiently 
justified the opinion I had formed. Doubtless he has 
a fine style, writes passages of great eloquence, and 
here and there expresses truths; but that one who has 
written and uttered such multitudinous absurdities 
should have acquired so great an influence is to me 
both surprising and disheartening." 

The following remarks about Carlyle are also 
of much interest : 

" He has, strange to say, been classed as a philos- 
opher! Considering that he either could not or would 
not think coherently — never set out from premises and 
reasoned his way to conclusions, but habitually dealt in 
intuitions and dogmatic assertions, he lacked the trait 
which, perhaps more than any other, distinguishes the 
philosopher properly so called. He lacked also a fur- 
ther trait. Instead of thinking calmly, as the philos- 
opher above all others does, he thought in a passion. 
It would take much seeking to find one whose intellect 
was perturbed by emotion in the same degree." 

Of Mill, from whom he experienced many acts 
of kindness, and with whose ideas he was for 
the most part in sympathy, he gives us this 
pen-portrait : 

" In manner he was quiet and unassuming. His face 
gave constant evidence of the extent to which in later 



life, as in his earlier life, his nervous system had been 
overtaxed, for he had frequent twitohings of some 
facial muscles. Another trait of expression I can 
recall — there was a certain habitual setting of the 
lips, implying, as it seemed to me, a conscious self- 
restraint. Too stern a discipline in his boyhood, and 
perhaps too serious a view of things in his later years, 
put, I think, an undue check on the display of pleasur- 
able feelings. I do not remember his laugh; and my 
impression is that though he appreciated good things he 
did not laugh heartily." 

We refrain somewhat reluctantly from giving 
other illustrations of this sort of portraiture, 
which, if not always just, is at least clear-cut 
and impressive. 

One more extract, taken from the chapter 
of " Reflections " appended to the second vol- 
ume, must end these illustrative quotations. 
As the expression of Spencer's ripest views 
upon the fundamental question of religious 
beliefs and practices, the following passages 
are perhaps the most deeply interesting to be 
found anywhere in the work. After speak- 
ing of the way in which " real creeds contin- 
ually diverge from nominal creeds, and adapt 
themselves to new social and individual re- 
quirements," and how " in modern preaching 
theological dogmas are dropping into the back- 
ground and ethical doctrines coming into the 
foreground," he goes on to say : 

« Thus I have come more and more to look calmly 
on forms of religious belief to which I had, in earlier 
days, a pronounced aversion. Holding that they are 
in the main naturally adapted to their respective peo- 
ples and times, it now seems to me well that they 
should severally live and work as long as the conditions 
permit, and, further, that sudden changes of religious 
institutions, or of political institutions, are certain to be 
followed by reactions. If it be asked why, thinking 
thus, I have persevered in settmg forth views at vari- 
ance with current creeds, my reply is the one elsewhere 
made: — It is for each to utter that which he sincerely 
believes to be true, and, adding his unit of influence to 
all other units, leave the results to work themselves 
out. . . . Thus religious creeds, which in one way or 
another occupy the sphere that rational interpretation 
seeks to occupy and fails, and fails the more it seeks, I 
have come to regard with a sympathy based on com- 
munity of need : feeling that dissent from them results 
from inability to accept the solutions offered, joined 
with the wish that solutions could be found." 

To some such mellowed view as this every 
serious thinker must come, after he has passed 
through the period of indignant revolt against 
the absurdities of tradition, and upon this com- 
mon ground the defenders of the old and the 
apostles of the new gospels may find room for 
mutual sympathies and a concerted endeavor to 
reach the larger truth.

a word of mention. We should like particu-

larly to speak at length of Spencer's travels 
— Italy, Egypt, America, — and of his effort 
to set right the distorted view of our public 
concerning the attitude of Englishmen during 
and after our Civil War. We should like 
also to speak of his friendships, of his delight 
in social intercourse, and of his recreations. 
We should like to illustrate the essential good 
humor which he preserved through his years of 
trial and hardship, and the animation given to 
his pages by the personal anecdote and the ex- 
cellent jesting which he recalls here and there. 
The lasting impressions which the autobiog- 
raphy leaves upon our mind is that, besides 
being the record of a life that was heroic in 
the finest sense, it is also a very human produc- 
tion, and one of the most absolutely honest 
books ever written. It is as honest as the 
" Diary " of Pepys and the " Confessions " of 
Rousseau, and has the advantage over those 
works of portraying a nature to which base- 
ness and pettiness were unknown, a character 
founded upon altruistic feeling and devotion to 
goodness and truth.

Navies, British and American.* 

With the sixth and seventh volumes of his 
definitive work on "The Royal Navy," bringing 
the story down to the death of Queen Victoria, 
Sir Wm. Laird Clowes completes his history, 
the amount of material having made it neces- 
sary to add another volume to the original plan. 
Interest for Americans will largely centre in 
the chapter on "The War with the United 
States, 1812-1816," since this chapter w^as 
contributed by Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, having 
been written in 1897, while he was one of the 
police commissioners of New York City. It is 
with this chapter that the sixth volume opens, 
so that it takes precedence chronologically as 
well as in point of interest. 

Those familiar with Mr. Roosevelt's account 
of « The Naval War of 1812," written fifteen 
years before, will look for some more mature 
statements and added facts. Mr. Clowes, in his 
preface, speaks of the newer work as attacking 
*' the subject from the more purely critical 
side." But the actuality seems to be that the

original history was so careful a presentation 
of the war in its various aspects that there was 
nothing to be added, and no change in the point 
of view to be made other than that necessitated 
by addressing a British as well as an American 
audience, and this more by way of introducing 
little amenities than in any other manner. The 
two salient points that constitute Mr. Roose- 
velt's claim to originality dominate both his- 
tories, — one being that the American frigates 
were larger, heavier, and better ships than those 
they met and conquered ; the other, that British 
self-confidence and ensuing lack of gunnery- 
practice contributed largely to the British 
defeat. But this chapter is open to one objec- 
tion that would not lie against the author's 
book above-named. Though not so long, and 
occupied largely with sketches of conflicts rather 
than detailed accounts of them, and though Mr. 
Roosevelt himself complains that his space is 
limited, the work is repetitious to a degree 
almost vexatious. It could have been com- 
pressed into two-thirds of its present limits 
without loss, or — another way of saying the 
same thing — it could have had half again as 
many facts within the same space. One reads, 
for example, four variants on the same theme, 
as follows : 

"During twenty years . . . in hundreds of single- 
ship fights, in which the forces engaged on each side 
were fairly equal, the monotonous record of Britain's 
triumphs had been broken by less than half-a-dozen de- 
feats" (page 29). 

"British captains, in single-ship contests, had not 
been accustomed to weigh too nicely the odds against 
them ; and in the twenty years during which they had 
overcome the navies of every maritime power in Europe 
they had repeatedly conquered in single fight when the 
odds against them had been far heavier " (page 37). 

" During the preceding twenty years, the traditions 
of the British Navy had taught him [Captain Garden, 
of the Macedonian] that it was possible to win against 
such odds. This had been proved scores of times in 
single fight" (page 47). 

" Time and again, moreover, the British had won 
against odds as great, or greater, in single fight " 
(page 61). 

" The countrymen of each combatant tried, on the 
one side, to enhance the glory of the victory by mini- 
mising this difference in force, and, on the other, to 
explain away the defeat by exaggerating it" (page 27). 

" The victors, the greater to enhance their glory, 
sought to minimise the difference of force in their 
favour . . . ; the vanquished, to extenuate their de- 
feats, attributed them entirely to the difference in force, 
and enormously exaggerated this " (page 59). 

In general, it is to be said of this, as of sev- 
eral other chapters in the two volumes under 
consideration, that in the desire to be accurate 
the author has sacrificed interest, seldom vivi-

fying bis accounts by the legitimate use of 
imagination. 

The second chapter, the forty- second of the 
work, is by Sir Clements R. Markham, G.C.B., 
President of the Royal Geographical Society, 
and is concerned with peace rather than war, 
dealing with the voyages and discoveries from 
1803 to 1815; while the forty-fifth chapter 
carries the same tale on to the year 1856. The 
intervening chapters are by Mr. Clowes, one 
dealing with the civil and the other with the 
military history of the Royal Navy from 1816 
to 1856, as in the volumes immediately pre- 
vious. The greatest destruction of human life 
was during the bombardment of the city of 
Acre by the British, Austrians, and Turks, in 
November, 1840, which is thus described : 

" The Allies had midshipmen at their mast-heads to 
direct aud correct the aim, and, whenever the smoke 
grew too thick, desisted for a short time. Yet the bom- 
bardment went on with very little relaxation for nearly 
three hours. A most frightful explosion then flung half 
the town into the air, and shook every ship to her keel, 
the concussion knocking down the seamen at their guns 
half a mile away. The grand magazine had blown up, 
killing, it is believed, upwards of 1200 people, and ab- 
solutely wrecking a space of about 60,000 square yards. 
This awful catastrophe sounded the fate of the town." 

Wars almost forgotten fill the pages, and 
place is found for the exploits of Cochrane and 
Brook, reminders of two most romantic lives. 
Arctic explorations cut no small figure ; while 
the civil history concerns itself with the intro- 
duction of steam, proving anew the conservat- 
ism of constituted authorities when confronted 
with radical changes in method. The most 
important of the wars treated is that of the 
Crimea ; and the statement recently made, that 
Japan finds a precedent for attacking the Rus- 
sian squadron at Port Arthur before the dec- 
laration of war in the course of Russia toward 
Turkey at the outbreak of the Crimean war in 
1853, is effectually disproved. The Sultan 
made his formal declaration on October 4 of 
that year ; the battle of Sinope, in which Rus- 
sia completely destroyed the squadron of Osman 
Pasha, was not fought until November 30, and 
then Osman fired the first gun in response to 
the Russian demand for his surrender. It is 
true that England, France, Prussia, and Austria 
were restraining the Turks from attacking, and 
had lost them a material advantage on land ; 
but Russia was in no way restrained, and was 
clearly within the limits of international law 
in preventing Osman from supplying the Turk- 
ish troops in Asia Minor, as he had intended 
doing. 



The seventh volume is differentiated from 
its predecessors by the appearance of the " Sir" 
before Mr. Clowes's name, in sign of the knight- 
hood conferred upon him in 1902 as a recogni- 
tion of the value of the present work. This is 
the most readable of all the volumes, by reason 
of its contemporaneousness, and is noteworthy 
in this country as showing the incidents in 
which men of the British and American navies 
fought side by side, as in the battle of the Peiho 
Forts in November, 1859, when Commodore 
Tattnall gave utterance to the remark, daily 
gaining in significance, '^ Blood is thicker than 
water"; the landing of American sailors and 
marines after the bombardment of Alexandria 
in July, 1882, and the march to Peking during 
the Boxer outbreak. The panic that seized the 
British in the first-named incident, as recorded 
by Mr. Maclay, is not mentioned by Sir Will- 
iam Clowes in the narrative ; and several omis- 
sions of the sort do not enter into his consider- 
ation, as is usual in history. 

The volume is divided into three chapters, 
two by Sir William on the civil and military 
history of the Royal Navy respectively, and 
one on voyages and discoveries since 1857, by 
Sir Clements R. Markham. The civil history, 
since it includes all that has made war-ships 
modern in the way of heavy guns, rapid-fire 
guns, and the armor to withstand them, is 
most informing in spite of its necessary tech- 
nicalities. Nothing is said concerning the ves- 
sels like the "Alabama," built in England for 
the Confederate States ; nor is the debt to 
Ericsson and other American inventors of the 
Civil War period acknowledged. The chap- 
ter on voyages and discoveries does not con- 
tain any accounts of the laying of the Atlantic 
cable, as might be supposed, but it appears 
briefly in the military history, and the Ameri- 
can initiative there is not mentioned. The 
part of Great Britain in deposing William 
Walker, " last of the filibusters," is set forth ; 
and there was in general, at this time, an in- 
terference in the affairs of the Spanish- 
American republics that would hardly be 
tolerated to-day. 

Many entertaining anecdotes of older days 
diversify the pages of the work, but the deep- 
est impression conveyed is that of the police 
service performed by the British navy through- 
out the world for the benefit of civilization 
and commerce. There is no dearth of criti- 
cism anywhere in the book, from Mr. Roose- 
velt's strictures on Jefferson and Madison, 
and occasional dabs at the Federalists of their

day as well, to comments on the failure of 
British naval authorities to awaken to modern 
needs interspersed through Sir William 
Clowes's narrative. 

All this forms a marked contrast to the 
work on " The New American Navy," by Mr. 
John D. Long, formerly secretary of our navy, 
who has nothing but praise for all that has 
been done by Americans in the way of build- 
ing war-ships, and of their conduct during the 
recent war with Spain. Two ofl&cers of our 
navy, and two only, fall under Mr. Long's 
displeasure ; and the value of the criticism in 
these cases may be best judged if we state at 
once that these officers are the victors of the 
battles of Manila Bay and of Santiago de Cuba. 
Eear-Admiral (then Commodore) Schley, for 
the way in which the " Brooklyn " was man- 
aged, and Admiral Dewey for approving of 
his management, fall under the displeasure of 
the former head of the naval department. The 
effect is perhaps not what was intended. 

The late Rear- Admiral Sampson upon more 
than one occasion was compelled to disobey the 
orders of the Board of Strategy during the 
war with Spain; but there is nothing but 
praise for that body, and its mistakes are not 
even hinted at. The late Eear-Admiral Samp- 
son is believed on good authority to have been 
more instrumental than any single officer in 
our navy in preventing the introduction of 
smokeless powder before the war. But this 
striking lack of modern equipment on the part 
of Mr. Long and his subordinates is not ex- 
plained, except in so far as he says that 
experiments had been in progress for some 
time previous to the war with smokeless pow- 
der. But the only statement made regarding 
the failure of our ships to be provided with it 
is contained in a single sentence, '' Smokeless 
powder was introduced into the American navy 
during the war with Spain." 

There is a somewhat disingenuous excuse 
given, in another place, to the effect that there 
was not enough smokeless powder in the coun- 
try to equip all the guns of all the ships, there- 
fore it was thought best to equip only a few 
ships. As a matter of fact, the only war-ships 
of the United States that were equipped with 
smokeless powder during the hostilities of 
1898 were those bought from Great Britain, 
smokeless powder and all, — the navy depart- 
ment under Secretary Long fitting out none 
of them. As a result of this indiscriminate 



praise and lack of discriminating criticism, 
the book is not a valuable one; nor does its 
author's official access to papers not at the com- 
mand of the public seem to have been of much 
service to him. The generally received opinion 
that Mr. Koosevelt, while assistant secretary 
of the navy under Mr. Long, was responsible 
for the shipment to Admiral Dewey of the 
munitions of war which made the victory at 
Manila possible, is rather elaborately dis- 
proved. Take it all in all, " The New Amer- 
ican Navy " is a book that could only be written 
by an American who believes that his country- 
men can do no wrong unless they chance to 
disagree with him personally.

An Epitome of Modern Germany.* 



With the death of Herman Grimm there 
passed from his enviable place in the life of 
Berlin a man, who, as Professor Francke had 
well observed, was "the most eminent advo- 
cate of aesthetic culture, the principal, if not 
sole, upholder of the classic tradition of Wei- 
mar and Jena." In the 419 compact pages 
of the autobiography of Sebastian Hensel, 
the only child of Fanny Mendelssohn, we have, 
as its title indicates, *■*■ an epitome of Germany's 
years of schooling," the period in which a nation 
ceased to be chiefly the land of poets and 
philosophers, in order to become an aggressive 
leader in commerce, manufactures, military 
affairs, and wealth — passing from " the glory 
that was Greece" to "the grandeur that was 
Rome." 

Hensel was born into the celebrated Men- 
delssohn family, that line distinguished by 
Lessing's friend, the philosopher Moses Men- 
delssohn, by that broad-minded financier and 
generous citizen, Abraham Mendelssohn- 
Bartholdy, and chiefly by those heaven-gifted 
children of the latter, Fanny and Felix, — not 
to mention other relatives, connections, and 
associates which made the palatial home in the 
Leipzigerstrasse the attractive place of resort 
for all manner of conspicuous talents in the 
days of the capital's greatest intellectual and 
aesthetic brilliancy — the centre of a culture 
which was as strong and sane and full-orbed 
as it was high and delicate and refined.

Fanny Mendelssohn married the painter, 
Professor Wilhelm Hensel. Sebastian, their 
only child, developed in an atmosphere which 
well-nigh predestinated him to the purely aes- 
thetic life, and his own mental gifts were by 
no means discreditable to the circle to which 
he belonged. As a matter of fact his days 
were spent in large practical concerns: the 
management of an extensive landed property 
in eastern Prussia, the office of secretary of a 
great building association which lent its share 
in creating the splendors of " new Berlin," 
and, particularly, in the very successful direc- 
tion of the luxurious KaiserJiof^ the first cos- 
mopolitan hotel in the German capital. Those 
who have enjoyed the grateful comforts of the 
Cafe Bauer^ at the intersection of Berlin's 
chief promenades, will be interested to learn 
here that it was Hensel who first caused this 
institution to migrate from Vienna. 

Apart from any final tendencies in this book, 
it is a keen delight to come into closest asso- 
ciation with so uniformly gifted and animated 
a group as that in which Hensel always moved. 
He surely was baptized with a liberal handful 
of the water of the Spree, for he was clever 
from the cradle — a Berliner Kind through 
and through. To such a person a sprightly 
style comes as naturally as breathing to other 
people : stabbing wit, mordant satire, corrosive 
sarcasm, jeux d'esprit, crisp daring phrases 
which verge upon slang, but fly straight to the 
mark, a continuous crackle of sparkling ori- 
ginality — sometimes more stout than delicate 
— these features are alive in every page of the 
book. There were always excellent women in 
this society, as the world has already come to 
know in HensePs splendid '' Life of the Men- 
delssohn Family," which, now in its eleventh 
edition, has become a classic. Like Hensel's 
autobiography, it was at first intended merely 
as a family-book for the children and imme- 
diate connections. Both books have passed 
on from private uses to become the common 
property of cultured humanity everywhere. 

The present work is, in fact, a continuation 
of the " Life," which came to an abrupt end 
with the death of Fanny Mendelssohn (Hen- 
sel) in 1847. Besides opening a fuller view 
of admirable people we had come to know in 
the "Life," it carries the history further, es- 
pecially in the new letters of Kebecca Men- 
delssohn (wife of the great mathematician 
Dirichlet), addressed to her nephew. The book 
is a modern criticism of life against a back- 



ground of high culture. In tendency it is 
democratic and political, given to comment 
upon the larger history of the times, delight- 
fully familiar, stocked with a fund of good 
stories, and, above all, up-to-date. If, at 
times, it may jar romantic souls by its tone of 
superiority toward the alluring world of dreams, 
its insistence upon reality and its impatience 
of mummery make it good reading for our 
day. However practical its author may be 
in business, he inherits a full stock of the in- 
flexible Prussian sense of honor, which stands 
out in refreshing contrast to the "graft" of 
Vienna, with which the author was forced to 
come in contact in his business ventures. In- 
cidentally, the most refreshing thing in the 
book is the account of stubborn opposition on 
the part of the Berlin authorities to giving a 
" concession " to a great corporation which 
might lead to a monopoly of the food- supply 
of the capital. Hensel satirizes their provin- 
cialism, but there is nothing finer than the 
watch-dog pertinacity with which they stood 
on guard to prevent any exploiting of the 
common peoples' necessities of life. After 
an unusually wide outlook upon the greater 
world the author comes to the final conclusion : 
" The life of a land- holder whose activities are 
carried on upon a large scale still seems to me 
the most enviable which can be imagined, ex- 
cept, perhaps, that of a gifted artist." 

The book is so full of interest that it is use- 
less to attempt to pick out particular features ; 
it is printed on good paper and in clear, honest 
Eoman letters, though with a culpable array 
of minor errors. Despite the fact that many 
of the most significant figures of the nine- 
teenth century appear at close range, there is 
unfortunately (as too often is the case with 
German books) no index. 

Hensel's autobiography would more than 
justify a first-rate English translation. In our 
" new education " we have many conditions 
which could gain light from these ample ex- 
periences. Although some of us are still old- 
fashioned enough to hold, first of all, to 
Romantic values, to 

" The light that never was on sea or land. 
The consecration and the poet's dream " 

as the supreme Guide of Life, we can all be 
profited by this intimate story of a high- 
minded man who was most successful in deal- 
ing with the modern world of affairs.

Christianity versus Dogma.* 

The late Auguste Sabatier, having pub- 
lished in 1897 his " Outlines of a Philosophy 
of Religion based upon Philosophy and His- 
tory," planned as a sequel a work devoted to the 
history of the Roman Catholic and Protestant 
dogmas, in which an attempt would be made to 
distinguish the genuine elements of the Chris- 
tian faith, and separate them from the errors 
which had accumulated under the guise of 
Christianity. This work was completed in 
the rough at the end of 1900 ; and Madame 
Sabatier in a prefatory note thus describes the 
author's feeling regarding it : 

"On December 2, 1900, my husband joyfully called 
me to him, saying, • I have put the last period to my 
book.' And while I was congratulating him, he added: 
* Now I shall let it rest during our journey to Egypt 
and Palestine. It will take me three months to revise 
it on our return, but I shall not modify its form, for I 
have said that which I desire to say. If accident be- 
falls me during the journey remember this: my book 
must come out whatever happens. There it lies,' he 
continued, turning to his desk; <you will give it to 
M^D^goz and Roberty, who will both willingly revise 
it; but it must appear!' He repeated the words with 
emphasis, separating each syllable to show that this was 
his well-considered determination." 

Although M. Sabatier had long been out of 
health, and evidently was aware of his slender 
hold on life, he did not cease to press forward, 
and when urged to rest would say, " I have 
work planned out for two hundred years." He 
died in the midst of his labors, as a warrior dies 
in battle, and did not even make that journey 
to Palestine which he had looked forward to as 
the crown of his toil. 

Under these circumstances, those who had 
to see the book through the press naturally 
hesitated to make alterations ; " with pious re- 
spect they have hardly touched the form of 
this work, preferring to leave some repetitions 
rather than risk weakening the thought, and 
not daring to undertake the work of condensa- 
tion which its author would have performed." 
It thus results that the book is unnecessarily 
long for the matter it contains, and many of 
the statements in it are repeated in different 
places in a manner rather discouraging to the 
reader. While it was entirely right to publish 
it so, it is probable that a condensed edition, 
prepared by one of the author's disciples at 
the University of Paris, would find an appre- 
ciative public. In such a new edition, one 

• Religions of Authority and the Religion of the 
Spirit. By Augnste Sabatier ; translated by Louise Seymour 
Honghton. New York : McClnre, Phillips & Co. 



would wish to see an index supplied, and it 
would be better to print the notes, which now 
constitute an appendix, as footnotes to the 
pages where they belong. 

Putting aside such minor criticisms as we 
have offered, we have nothing but praise for 
the book. The present reviewer is not one of 
those who can pretend to estimate the accuracy 
of the historical data given, but it may be said 
that not only was M. Sabatier a student of the 
first rank, but his conclusions, as regards their 
main and essential outlines, do not differ from 
those already reached by others who had used 
rational historical methods. It is not probable 
that the author wished the work to be regarded 
as a contribution to historical research, so 
much as an interpretation of the known facts 
of history, in the light of our knowledge of 
the human mind. It is precisely by this ap- 
plication of psychology to history that the 
latter is transformed from a dry record of real 
or supposed events to a living reality, vitally 
connected with the life we live to-day. 

The discussion of the conflict between 
Christianity and Dogma may be approached 
in two different ways. To admit that there is 
a conflict is to condemn the latter, since the 
validity of the dogmas discussed depends upon 
their assumed Christian authority. M. Saba- 
tier says in his preface: " Two systems of theol- 
ogy still confront one another: the theology 
of authority and the theology of experience," 
and it is evident from the first which he re- 
gards as truly Christian. The work is that 
of a man who has found in the religion of 
Christ that which directly appeals to the 
human mind, — to which the support derived 
from external authority is not only no support, 
but a hindrance. Dogma is thus condemned 
a priori^ as it were, and the second method of 
discussion, that in which the actual historical 
facts are considered, seems in a measure un- 
necessary. 

If Christ was in no sense the founder of a 
new body of dogma, what did he do? M. Saba- 
tier does not leave us in doubt. 

" The essential characteristic of the gospel of Christ, 
that by which it marks a new epoch in the religious 
and moral development of humanity, is that it has made 
things that were formerly essential and of principal im- 
portance — priesthood, rite, exterior law — to be acces- 
sories; and on the other hand has raised those which 
were formerly derived and subordinate — heart piety 
and relations with God — to be things of final and cap- 
ital importance, the very essence of religion. Thus the 
religious world has been reversed ; all its relations have 
been inverted because its centre of gravity has been dis-

placed. Never in all human history was there a more 
radical revolution and change" (p. 296). 

" Jesus promised his disciples the help and guidance 
of the spirit of God, in all circumstances, for all their 
needs, and in all that they should have to do or to suffer, 
but in no sense to contribute a new scriptural code to 
which Christians would thenceforth be forever enslaved. 
How, then, came it to pass that the Church learned to 
distrust the Master's promise, and hastens to build up 
again that which he destroyed — the absolute authority 
of the so-called divine letter?" (p. 299). 

The explanation is this : when new thoughts, 
laws, or customs appear to conquer the world, 
they do but engraft themselves on those which 
previously existed. New blood introduced into 
a race may profoundly modify it, but it does 
not summarily banish that which is old. The 
time of Christ was a time of religious unrest, 
and as to-day, people were seeking something 
to replace the faith which was rapidly failing 
them. The Christian gospel, a veritable spir- 
itual communion, exalted the subjective side 
of human personality, and made the value of 
external things seem as nothing to the worth 
of the human soul. Not all were citizens of 
Rome, but all who chose might be children of 
God, — nay, all were so, if they would but 
acknowledge it. It is not difficult to see how 
this doctrine, based on the most essential char- 
acters of the human mind, interpreted far and 
wide by so great a master of thought and 
language as Paul, should have gained accept- 
ance. The phenomenon was, after all, none 
other than a part of that struggle for freedom 
which has convulsed peoples from the earliest 
dawn of history, and will do so yet again. 
Thus understood, it takes its place as one of 
the upward steps of mankind, a real advance 
of incalculable importance, but not unchecked 
by that sinister hand which always bars the 
way. As a matter of fact, the old paganism, 
supposed to be destroyed, was bound to have 
its revenge, and it took it in full measure. 
Christianity, so-called, became an officially 
governed institution ; the spirit was denied to 
those who were not in authority ; God was no 
more approachable than some haughty em- 
peror. Not only was the purpose of Christ 
defeated, but the very name of the Master was 
applied to that which he had set aside. Was 
the gospel of Christ therefore a dead letter? 
By no means. It held its own in the recesses 
of the people's hearts, like a defeated but not 
conquered people in the fastnesses of their 
mountains. Every now and then it surged for- 
ward, often to be condemned as heresy. Even- 
tually it gained a remarkable success in the 
reformation initiated by Luther, and protest- 



antism stood for freedom long- denied. The 
sinister hand, however, had not lost its cunning, 
and protestantism itself became bound by the 
dogma of the infallibility of the Biblical text 
— a dogma more absurd and less easy to 
defend than that of papal supremacy. In mod- 
ern times this also has been undermined, and 
M. Sabatier sees the dawn of a new era in 
which Christ shall come to his own. May it 
indeed be so, but it will not be without a strug- 
gle, nor will Christianity ever maintain itself 
as a passive thing. Custom may pass into 
habit, instincts may be formed, but the life of 
the Spirit is always life, the golden rim on 
the edge of consciousness, the point of contact 
with the beyond. Herein, indeed, lies the 
assurance of the reality and permanence of 
our being. rp^ jy^ ^^ Cockerell. 



A PREACHER OF THE LiARGER HOPE.* 



It is wholly fitting that a year of reverential 
silence should have followed the death of a 
man like Dean Farrar, and that the first voice 
to break the silence with the story of his life 
should be that of his son. Mr. Reginald 
Farrar 's task has not grown less difficult, how- 
ever, with the lapse of months, for delay has 
whetted expectation. Now that the authorita- 
tive life is published, many of us will doubtless 
feel that we had come to expect too much of it. 
That it should take rank in the first class of 
biographies was scarcely reasonable to hope, 
since it was written by a man who makes no 
claim to literary genius, and whose very near- 
ness to his subject precludes the rendering of 
ultimate judgments. Moreover he himself has 
cherished no ambitious designs, but has "aimed 
at producing rather a memoir of such length 
as should be within the compass of the general 
reader than a complete and exhaustive bio- 
graphy." That his work is ideal so far as it 
goes, no one will hesitate to admit. But there 
may perhaps remain even among " general 
readers " some who will be unwilling to forego 
their larger expectations for the author's mod- 
est purpose, and who will feel that in this case, 
in which material was so abundant and so in- 
teresting, two volumes would have been better 
than one. 

In order to correct the necessary limitations 
of one person's view, Mr. Farrar has " adopted

the method of inviting friends and colleagues 
who were associated with his father at different 
periods of his life to contribute reminiscences 
of those periods." Instead of leading to the 
maddening confusion in which this method 
often results, the multiple-narrative is so skil- 
fully managed as to add a wealth of vivid per- 
sonal interest to the story. No one could have 
told the history of Frederick Farrar's days at 
King's College so delightfully as his fellow- 
student Edwin Arnold, who naively confesses 
that Farrar usually took first prize and Arnold 
^^proxime accessiti*^ except that sometimes 
when the contests were theological the order 
was reversed ! Of the young master's early 
struggles at Marlborough, when the college 
was new and " all things lay in doubt," one of 
his pupils writes : 

" F. W. F. came to Marlborough like an apparition — 
a flame of fire — kindling enthusiasm for all that was 
noble and chivalrous. No one ever was so young as he 
was in those days, and I suppose he was then twenty- 
three or twenty- four; but the marvel was, how he knew 
such a lot and associated himself with us little fellows, as 
if we could minister to his happiness. . . . He played foot- 
ball (Rugby) like a madman, running amuck with his 
eyes shut, and got awfully mauled, laetissima pulvere 
farra, as some fellows said, much to his delight." 

Another pupil tells how, in his fifteen busy 
years of teaching at Harrow, ♦' his exuberance 
of rhetoric, though in latter years it offended 
adult audiences, awed and fascinated boys, and 
his solemn yet glowing appeals for righteous- 
ness and purity and moral courage left perma- 
nent dints on our hearts, and — what is less 
usual — on our lives." Friends, assistants, 
and various members of his family tell the more 
familiar story of his life as Canon of West- 
minster and Dean of Canterbury, celebrating 
with loving particularity the countless activities 
and deeds of friendliness which made him one 
of the most influential men of the century. 
Glimpses of his childhood, of his boyish days 
of privation and rigorous discipline at King 
William's College, Isle of Man, — where the 
absence of cheap literature saved him ''from 
becoming the debauchee of shoddy fiction " and 
gave him time to develop his literary bent by 
committing to memory long passages of the 
English poets, — and of his undergraduate life 
at Oxford, are quoted from his own stories 
of "Eric," "St. Winifred's," and "Julian 
Home," which are to some extent autobiograph- 
ical. Whenever the author himself becomes 
the narrator, he is straightforward and effec- 
tive, fulfilling the ideal which he sets himself 
when he says : " I have tried impartially to 



paint the portrait of my father as he lived, not 
ignoring the fact that his work was often the 
subject of criticism, but writing throughout, as 
a son must needs write of such a father, in a 
spirit of loving reverence." 

Many apparent omissions in the book are 
due to the author's unwillingness to trespass 
on ground that his father had covered in his 
own writings. The chapter which one natur- 
ally expects to find on Dean Farrar's friends, 
for instance, — a chapter which would have 
been of especial interest to Americans, since 
the great churchman had many warm personal 
friends in this country, — is lacking, because it 
would have repeated much of what is contained 
in "Men I Have Known." Wisely enough, 
however, a condensed statement of his religious 
belief is quoted from " Eternal Hope," so that 
exact knowledge of his right to the title 
" preacher of the larger hope " may be in pos- 
session of all readers of his biography. 

One feels in closing the volume that the 
letters quoted in it though too many for artistic 
effect, are of great significance nevertheless as 
showing how generously the world responds to 
a life like Dean Farrar's. The picture left 
on one's mind, though so variously composed, 
is clear and satisfying, and does justice, we 
are glad to feel, to a man who, besides being 
a great teacher, writer, and preacher, was one 
of " the saints elect, whom all hearts confess."

Books about Italy.* 

Whoever adds another book to the already long 
list of works on Italy or Italian Art — perennially 
fascinating themes — should have good reason to 
offer for doing so. Either he should have some 
new material, or some new way of looking at the 
old. Two books on the Italian Renaissance, one a 
translation from the French, the other from the 
German, justify their introduction to English read- 
ers by reason of their respective individualities in 
point of view. Dealing with almost precisely the

same period — the earlj years of the sixteenth 
century — in treatment and purpose they are yet so 
entirely different that there is room for both. The 
distinguishing characteristic of the French work is 
its picturesqueness. The familiar facts are grouped 
ronnd some central point, — as a picture, a church, 
a phrase from some old document, — in a way to 
create a vivid impression which will not soon escape 
the memory, the whole effect being like a series of 
clear-cut silhouettes. Under the title " Rome and 
the Renaissance," the author sets his boundaries of 
place to one city alone, his boundaries of time to 
the pontificate of Julius 11. (1503-1513). A study 
of the Renaissance apart from the city of Florence 
might seem at first thought like the play of Hamlet 
without the character ; but considering the embar- 
rassment of riches here, elimination becomes a wise 
policy. Michelangelo busy in the Sistine Chapel, 
Raphael in the Vatican Stanze, Bramante in the 
Vatican Belvedere and at the new St. Peters, the 
belligerent but art-loving old man in the pontifical 
chair planning and directing all, — these are figures 
large enough and absorbing enough to warrant our 
ignoring for the time being some no less great or 
even greater work elsewhere. The writer who can 
supplement wise powers of elimination by equally 
wise powers of classification travels on the right 
road and attains success in the presentation of his 
theme, — as in the present case. A good illus- 
tration of the author's method may be gained from 
his opening chapter, in which we are introduced to 
the future Pope Julius II. The chapter is called 
''Melozzo's Freeco," — meaning the large picture 
called "Sixtus IV., Founder of the Vatican Li- 
brary," familiar to all who have visited the Picture 
Gallery of the Vatican and to many others through 
photographs. Probably we have thought of it less 
in its historical significance than as a monumental 
work of Umbrian art. Our author says of it : 

" This fresco by Melozzo da Forli is a great page of history, 
as well as a great page of painting. It helps us marvellously 
to understand those Popes of the Renaissance, with all their 
qualities and their faults, their political rather than religious 
turn of mind, their humanist predilections, their passion for 
building and beautifying the city of Rome, their nepotism. 
In the haughty old man seated there, nothing recalls the 
Francesco della Rovere of earlier days, the humble monk 
of the Order of the Minor Brethren, born of obscure parentage 
in Ligurian Savona. He sits like a king, in a splendid hall, 
surrounded by high dignitaries of Church and State, all very 
young, — all, furthermore, his nearest kinsmen. His profile 
is singularly clearcut, and singularly hard, also, — as is not nn- 
Buited to the all too clearly proven accomplice of the Pazzi." 

Each one of the six characters — four of them 
" nephews" — is in turn made the subject of an his- 
torical sketch, ending with Giuliano della Rovere, 
now thirty-one years of age, and for the last six 
years Cardinal of San Pietro in Vincoli. 

" It is upon this figure that Melozzo has concentrated all 
the vigor of his brush, with a presentiment, it would seem, 
of the great place that history was to give to his subject. 
What energy in the face, already so deeply marked by am- 
bition I What fire in the glance I And, withal, a certain 
veiled sadness, and that unsatisfied look which comes to the 
elect of destiny when their star too long delays its coming." 



Another highly picturesque chapter is the one 
called "A Family Sanctuary (1505-1508)," namely, 
the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo. Not only 
do we learn how it came to be the favorite and 
domestic sanctuary of the Rovere family, but also 
how it marks a memorable date and an important 
phase in the history of sepulchral monuments in 
general. « The mediaeval conception of a bier and 
the dead figure lying upon it, — a severe and 
stately theme which had so long inspired the Pisani, 
the Cosmati, the admirable Tuscan sculptors of the 
Quattrocento, — was now embodied for the last 
time in this church by Andrea Sansovino, and with 
excess of emphasis in the tombs of Sforza and of 
Girolamo Basso." The translation of this work has 
been done admirably by John Dennie, and fifty-two 
full-page illustrations have been well chosen to en- 
force the argument of the text. 

The German work, '< The Art of the Italian 
Renaissance," is by Professor Heinrich Wo'fflin of 
Berlin University. He considers the word Renais- 
sance as covering the first twenty-five years of the 
sixteenth century, and says that in all the history of 
Italian art there is no more obscure period than this 
which we call its golden age. The task which be 
sets himself is the forever tempting but forever im- 
possible one of seeking the sources of artistic crea- 
tion, of revealing the inner sanctuary of the artistic 
mind in the act of composition. In a prefatory 
note. Sir Walter Armstrong, Director of the Na- 
tional Gallery at Dublin, says: ''Anyone reading 
Herr Wolfflin carefully may fairly assume that he 
is following the workings of Raphael's mind as 
he built up things like the Disputa, the School of 
Athens and the Madonna di San Sisto." If only 
the learned German, or anyone, could ever do any- 
thing like this, that would indeed be something to 
win eternal fame and gratitude ! But perhaps he is 
as successful as the nature of the case allows ; and 
in chapters on Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, 
Raphael, Fra Bartolommeo, and Andrea del Sarto, 
their technical methods of producing desired effects 
are discussed with no small amount of discrimina- 
tion and insight. These chapters occupy about two- 
thirds of the volume; but they are, after all, less 
valuable than the remaining third devoted to " The 
New Feeling," "The New Beauty," and "The New 
Pictorial Form." The generalizations on these sub- 
jects are enforced by parallel illustrations showing 
the variance of treatment of the same theme as 
presented by the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries 
respectively. The New Feeling in art was nothing 
less than a new conception of human greatness and 
dignity. Men developed a feeling for the impor- 
tant, the solemn, the grandiose, in comparison with 
which the fifteenth century must have appeared 
awkward and timid. There was also a tendency to 
weaken the expression of emotion. For example, — 

"In the Scene of the Annunciation, Mary is no longer 
the girl gazing in joyful alarm at the unexpected visitor, as 
Filippo, Baldovinetti, or Lorenzo di Credi painted her, nor 
the modest maiden casting her eyes down like a candidate for

confirmation ; but, absolutely composed, yr\th a royal bearing, 
she receives the angel like a fashionable lady who is not to 
be taken by surprise. . . . Art is no longer middle class, 
but aristocratic. . . . Only important events were considered 
worthy of notice. In the stories of the Qaattrocentists there 
are a number of homely, idyllic touches, which have little to 
do with the real theme, but delight the modern spectator 
with their simplicity. . . . The interest of the later historical 
picture was concentrated entirely on the actual event. This 
entailed a rigorous condensation of the diffuse elements hith- 
erto introduced in Lives of the Virgin and kindred subjects. 
. . . Reality was the first thought of the fifteenth century, 
whether the result was or was not beautiful. The sixteenth 
century banished the stereotyped forms whenever they were 
unlovely. The Magdalen is the frail beauty and not the ema- 
ciated penitent, and the Baptist takes on the strong virile 
beauty of a man who has grown up in wind and weather, 
without a trace of privation or asceticism. The youthful St. 
John again, is depicted as the model of a perfectly beautiful 
boy, and in this form became a favorite figure of the epoch." 

Ideals of beauty themgelves underwent a change. 

*' The taste of the early Renaissance inclined to undevel- 
oped forms, and slim, agile figures. The angular grace and 
the salient outlines of youth had a greater charm than the 
rounded abundance of womanhood or the ripe strength of 
manhood. The girl-angels of Botticelli and Filippino, with 
their sharp joints and lean arms, represent the ideal of youth- 
ful beauty. The sixteenth century had a different standard. 
. . . Its gallery of beauty contains none but mature types, 
e. g., the Donna Velata, the Dorothea at Berlin, the Forna- 
rina of the Tribuna, the magnificent female figure by Andrea 
del Sarto at Madrid, etc. Taste reverted to the fully devel- 
oped woman." 

Under the title " The New Pictorial Form " the 
author attempts to giasp and expound the various 
components which make up the idea of a rich and 
mature style, — repose, space, mass, size, simplifica- 
tion, lucidity, enrichment, unity, and inevitability. 
An undertaking of such difficulty on the part of the 
writer naturally is not entirely easy on the part of 
the reader. Yet it is service for gratitude, since it 
is one so seldom rendered. It goes beyond where 
most histories of art end. In the author's own 
words, near the conclusion, — 

"There is a conception of the history of Art which sees in 
Art merely a ' translation of life ' into pictorial language, and 
tries to make every style comprehensible as an expression of 
the prevalent spirit of the time. Would anyone deny that 
this is a profitable way of looking at the question ? Yet it 
only leads to a certain fixed point, one might almost say only 
as far as the point where art begins. Anyone who restricts 
himself to the subject-matter in works of art will be satisfied 
with it ; but as soon as he wishes to estimate things by artistic 
standards, he is compelled to deal with formal elements which 
are in themselves inexpressive, and belong to a development 
of a purely optical kind." 

It is a pity that so suggestive a book should not 
have had a more careful proofreading of the text, 
and that the hundred illustrations, well-chosen in 
themselves, are so badly executed that they do 
painfully scant justice to the great originals. 

A single-volume History of Florence in En- 
glish, combining in one narrative both her political 
and her artistic evolution, is something which has 
long been desired. Each story has been told sepa- 
rately very often and with much elaboration. But 
there has been no English work showing them as 
parts of one whole, until the publication of Mr. 
Francis A. Hyett's work entitled •' Florence, her 



History and Art." The confusing conditions be- 
tween Blacks and Whites, the ups and downs of 
the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the peculiar powers 
of the Trade Guilds, the prerogatives of the un- 
titled Medici, seem to have a new import when we 
see how closely allied these political experiments 
were with a great literature and a many-sided art. 
The period of the Republic (1200-1530) coincides 
very nearly with the period of greatest artistic 
development, and the book concerns itself mainly 
with the story of these three centuries. The diffi- 
culties of epitomizing two such stupendous themes 
must have been great, but they have been overcome 
triumphantly. The space given to Art and Litera- 
ture is about a fourth of tbe nearly six hundred 
pages ; their consideration is confessedly paren- 
thetical, and dependent upon the generally accepted 
authorities, such as Ruskin, Symonds, C. C. Perkins, 
Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Morelli, Berenson, and 
others. Indeed, if there is any fault to be found 
with this book it is that the foot-notes are almost 
irritating in their abundance, especially when it is 
quite evident that the author is fully competent for 
independent investigation and vigorous statement 
when he attempts it. The following, concerning 
Architecture, will serve as an example : 

"In Florence, Renaissance Architecture was born, and in 
Florence the disease which put an end to its existence was 
contracted. Brunelleschi was its parent, and Michelangelo 
(more than any single man) was its destroyer. ... In the 
San Lorenzo Sacristy and the Laurentian Library he sowed 
the seeds which blossomed into the barocco." 

Also this, after tracing the downfall of Renaissance 
Art in painting : 

"These painters, by a study of antique forms, merely 
caught a trick of expression, and their works have only the 
same kind of merit that is to be found in a good parody. Of 
this trick they were inordinately proud and made a great 
parade. The pedantry of Art in its Post-Raphaelite days had 
more to do with its overthrow than its secularization, and for 
this neither Paganism nor Naturalism can be held responsible. 
Nevertheless, pedantry was but a secondary cause. The pri- 
mary cause of the decadence of Renaissance Art in Italy was 
that Christianity and Paganism had both become shams." 

About the time that the great artistic work of 
Italy was practically completed, travellers from the 
north of Europe began to visit the country and to 
record their impressions. But Englishmen, even 
the most cultured, lacked the ability to discuss art 
at all at the time Vasari's " Lives " were written, 
and even much later. The northern sight- seers 
were at first instructed by the inhabitants ; but they 
soon began to compare, to classify. We travel 
now with their accumulated experience ; but many 
appreciations which are easy to us now are the 
results of years of inquiry. It is worth while, 
therefore, to trace the growth of this SB-tthetic 
evolution. In a work called '' The Book of Italian 
Travel " we have a symposium of traveller's re- 
ports expressing their delight when fresh from 
one of the unique experiences of life. Poets and 
dramatists from the time of Chaucer had used 
Italian books as a mine of romantic material, but 
this was a different matter, and the real succession

of literary travellers began with Coryatt, whose 
" Crudities " was the result of a journey to Venice 
in 1608. From that time on, selected descrip- 
tions and appreciations embracing such names 
as Montaigne, Evelyn, Addison, Goethe, Shelley, 
Dickens, Taine, Symonds, and many others, show 
how each and all have felt toward this '' woman- 
country," and how their common thought has been 
the one so quaintly expressed by James Howell 
(1641): "She hath been always accounted the 
Nurse of Policy, Learning, Musiqae, Architecture, 
and Limning, with other perfections which she dis- 
penseth to the rest of Europe."

Madame Waddington is not the 
Abi^\dam*. o°^y diplomat's wife who can write 

good letters from abroad. Another 
countrywoman of ours sent home, at an earlier 
date, almost as interesting sketches of persons and 
things in Europe. We refer to Mrs. George Ban- 
croft's " Letters from England " (Scribner) during 
her husband's ministry there (1846-49). She saw 
everything with American eyes, commenting and 
contrasting, always with generous appreciation and 
with a laudable desire to profit by her splendid 
social opportunities, but still retaining the old long«- 
ing for home ways and home people. In this 
respect she reminds one of her famous predecessor 
at the same court, the first American minister's 
wife, Abigail Adams, — true-hearted New-England 
women both. We have, in these letters to Mrs. 
Bancroft's sons and other near relatives, the ex- 
pected references to people of note whom she met ; 
and it is to be regretted that these references are 
not oftener expanded into pen-portraits, or even into 
some sort of flash-light characterization. But a din- 
ner at Macready's does give us a glimpse of Carlyle, 
" who talked all dinner-time in his broad Scotch, in 
the most inimitable way. He is full of wit, and 
happened to get upon James L, upon which topic 
he was superb." Emerson joins pleasantly, for a 
few pages, in this endless round of dining and 
breakfasting and other social functions. It was 
Mrs. Bancroft who introduced him to the circle at 
Rogers's breakfast-table. A whole evening at Rydal 
Mount with Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth contributes, 
to our disappointment, not one word about host or 
hostess. But the letter was penned in haste, as 
indeed all those in the book seem to have been, to 
judge by the frequent omissions of words, which 
have in most cases been supplied in brackets, and 
also by the occasional blanks left for illegible 
scrawls. Our compensation for faults of omission 
and of commission must be in the assurance that 
the writer had no thought of future publication.

count of the group of French refugees that gathered 
within its walls after the fall of Louis XVI., and of 
their relations with Fanny Burney and her friends. 
One of this group was Alexander d'Arblay, to whom 
Miss Burney was afterwards married. This mar- 
riage and its early fortunes gradually become the 
principal theme of the book, which includes sev- 
eral unpublished letters written by the author of 
" Evelina," by her father, and by Edmund Burke. 
At Juniper Hall lived for a time M. de Narbonne, 
who as minister of Louis XVI. had urged the war 
against Austria in the hope that the King would 
gain popularity and strength enough as leader in 
a national struggle to overawe and punish the 
Jacobins. Another member of the group was the 
young Mathieu de Montmorency, whose generous 
illusions must have paled a little since the day in 
the Constituent Assembly when he had argued that 
in drawing up a declaration of rights the French 
enjoyed an advantage over the Americans, for they 
" could more boldly invoke reason and allow it to 
speak a language more unalloyed." Among the 
visitors at the house were Mme. de Stael and 
Talleyrand, and also the Doke de la Rochefoucauld- 
Liancourt, who shortly afterwards travelled exten- 
sively in America and filled eight stately volumes 
with his observations. At a little cottage near by 
lived Mme. de Broglie, the daughter-in-law of old 
Marshall de Broglie, the commander of the army 
around Versailles and Paris just before the July 
uprising. It is the interchange of politenesses be- 
tween these persons and their English friends that 
Miss Hill pleasantly describes, with little effort to 
draw in clear outline any personage save perhaps 
Fanny Burney herself. The story gains its main 
interest from the fame of the characters, but also to 
some degree from its glimpses of English country 
life in the eighteenth century. The references to 
the Revolution in the earlier pages belong to the 
polite English legend of what the French did. The 
publisher, Mr. John Lane, has given the volume a 
handsome setting, and the pages are enriched with 
several excellent portraits in photogravure and nu- 
merous pen-drawings.

master of those who know," it is to be expected that 
this latest tribute to him should proceed from one 
of the knowing. The pages teem with references 
to works of all schools and lands, and the writer has 
seen the original of nearly every existing piece of 
sculpture, architecture, and painting that he men- 
tions. Yet, in spite of his evident erudition, he as- 
signs little space to debated questions of date and 
authenticity, and seems constantly aware that both 
his subject and his readers are human. Thus he is 
in harmony with the spirit of Donatello, who cared 
primarily not for abstractions, but for life as he saw 
it in roguish children, in calm and majestic citizens 
of middle age, and in gnarled and bald old men. 
In his discussion of Donatello's sense of distance. 
Lord Balcarres compares his work with that of 
classic sculptors, and calls our attention to the mean- 
ingless summit of the Trajan column, to the lack of 
variation in the reliefs of different altitudes upon 
Roman arches, and to the Parthenon Frieze, which, 
when in position, '' was only visible at a most acute 
angle and in a most unfavorable light," so that the 
" skill of Phidias was never fully revealed until its 
home had been changed from Athens to Blooms- 
bury." The protruding forehead of Zeus and the 
deep-set eyes of the Vatican Medusa are merely 
'' accidents or else coincidences." We are told, too, 
that '' Donatello was certainly no realist in the sense 
that an ideal was excluded, nor could he have been 
led by realism into servile imitation or the multipli- 
cation of realities "; that he '< took the lead among 
those who founded their art upon the observation 
of nature." However, his "love of nature was lim- 
ited to the human aspect," so that he "could only 
make cut flowers and withered fruit." His drapery, 
hands, grouping, technique, relation to Gothic art, 
and sense of light and shade and of proportion, are 
all treated in detail. It seems perhaps irrelevant 
to notice typographical mistakes, to wish that the 
book were divided into chapters, or to wonder why 
we are nowhere given Donatello's full aame. Our 
writer uses few superlatives, yet as we read his 
descriptions of statues, busts, medallions, singing- 
galleries, doors, fonts, tombs, and pulpits, we catch 
something of his enthusiasm. Donatello was mas- 
ter of low relief; his Martelli shield presents the 
most satisfactory of griffins, his Gattamelata is one 
of the world's two greatest equestrian statues, and 
his St. George is too perfect to challenge competi- 
tion. Surely it is well that we have so careful and 
comprehensive a presentation of this versatile, fas- 
cinating, and robust sculptor. 

Lift and labor The second series of " The Life and 
0/ the people Labor of the People of London" 

of London. (MacmiUan), written by Mr. Charles 

Booth with the assistance of several of his asso- 
ciates, deals with the large subject of Industry. 
As the work comprises five volumes of three hun- 
dred pages each, and the style is yet concise, it 
provides its readers with a very extensive view of 
London's industrial conditions. Further, it sug- 



gests the trend of modern industry, whose char- 
acteristics in general, as Mr. Booth says, do not 
differ greatly from those prevailing in London. 
He employs a double method of inquiry : he at- 
tempts to ascertain, first, how people live ; and, 
second, how they work. After a general survey of 
the situation, he divides the whole population of 
London according to its occupations, and applies 
the statistics already given to each industrial sec- 
tion. His classification is elaborate, — dealing first 
with the age, sex, and social conditions of the peo- 
ple engaged in a group of trades, and then in more 
detail with those in each separate trade. After 
four volumes of statistics, Mr. Booth makes a 
number of comparisons between the various trade 
sections, as to apparent poverty, earnings, social 
conditions, etc., and then draws some conclusions 
on the subjects of employment, trade-unionism, 
wages, and industrial remedies. He recognizes, 
as the characteristics of modern industry, '< The 
speculative forestalling of wants, a great com- 
plexity of operation, and increased responsibility 
of management." In his chapter on trade-unions, 
he does not attempt definitely to fix the relations 
between capital and labor, but says : " There is 
neither fixity nor finality in industrial relationships, 
and there are no sharply dividing lines." His 
conclusions are interesting and suggestive. " There 
is no single panacea," he says, "no philosopher's 
stone by which economists or statesmen can touch 
the surging life of London, even with the glint of 
an age of gold. It is indeed not this or that par- 
ticular remedy that is the most essential need, but 
rather a vital movement ; not laws or regulations, 
but the creation of a quiet determination on the 
part of men and women, rich and poor alike, to do 
their individual share." 

The Japanese ^f ^^ '^^^ ^^^^^^J f°<^ Somewhat un- 
methodof willingly coming into consciousness 

physical training. ^^^^ jjjg Japanese have a civilization 
fully comparable with our own, notably in that 
final boast of Christendom, the art of making war, 
we are coming more and more to study Japanese 
methods, in the belief that possibly there is more 
to be learned from them than we have to teach 
their inventors. This is illustrated by two books 
written by Mr. H. Irving Hancock, "Japanese Phys- 
ical Training" and "Physical Training for Women 
by Japanese Methods" (Putnam). In both the old 
jiu-jitsu exercises of the samurai^ the feudal re- 
tainers of the ancien rSgime, are set forth with 
just enough explicitness of detail to awaken curi- 
osity and stimulate the inventive American mind 
to experimentation. The two books are differen- 
tiated by prescribing a specific series o^ gymnastic 
and calisthenic exercises for women, looking toward 
complete bodily development, while those for men 
are suggestive rather than descriptive. Jiu-jutsu 
is a complete regimen for obtaining and maintain- 
ing health and strength. A dietary of the simplest 
sort is prescribed, which includes the daily absorp-

tion of a gallon of water — a procedure in complete 
opposition to all conceptions of Western trainers. 
With no apparatus except a strong bamboo wand, 
which is used only in a limited number of cases, the 
subject is then developed symmetrically with a view 
to injuring others without being injured himself, 
there being no restriction in the means to be em- 
ployed to either end. Hair may be pulled, bones 
broken, and spines put out of commission with a 
celerity and freedom that indicates one reason why 
the Japanese are so uniformly polite to one another 
— it would hardly be profitable to be rude to a per- 
son who is able to dislocate one's neck without 
warning. It is to be said that Mr. Hancock does 
nut prescribe all the methods by which death can 
be inflicted in this glorification of the '' rough-and- 
tumble fight " of Christian lands, holding a certain 
reserve that is rather stimulating to the imagina- 
tion, and forcing a reconsideration of the restric- 
tions Christians place upon hand-to-hand conflicts 
— restrictions, be it noted, as unknown to the ath- 
letes of classical times as to the samurai. 



The individual 
in hit relation! 
to society. 



There never was a time when so 
much was written about the various 
problems that concern the life of the 
individual, the history of the race, the relationship 
between man and his fellows, and between man and 
the state. Yet perhaps there never was a time when 
it was so hard for a person of limited time to ac- 
quire, through reading, a general knowledge of these 
questions. The trouble lies in the over-specialization 
of subject: the biological aspect is treated, not in 
one book, but in a great series of books ; the his- 
torical aspect in another series, the political in a 
third, the educational in a fourth, and so on through 
a long list, until it is almost impossible for a begin- 
ner to make more than a chance choice of aspects. 
It is safe to say that, with the probable exception 
of Mr. C. Hanf ord Henderson's " Education and the 
Larger Life," which treats the philosophical rather 
than the practical side, there has been no attempt 
at a correlation of all the great questions, before the 
publication of Prof. Nathaniel S. Shaler's study of 
the individual and the government entitled ''The 
Citizen" (A. S. Barnes & Co.). The book is, in a 
way, a sequel to the author's work on " The Indi- 
vidual," which, by its simplicity, its convincing logic, 
and its sane philosophy of life, won its way to a 
remarkable popularity a few years ago. The pres- 
ent work has all the qualities that recommended 
the previous one, and adds that of definiteness in 
the treatment of questions that apply directly to the 
daily life of every American citizen. In a space of 
only three hundred pages it is of course impossible 
to discuss fully a series of questions that includes the 
origin of mankind, the beginnings of government, 
the share of the average man in the state, party 
allegiance, origin and distribution of wealth, educa- 
tion, public health, universal suffrage, the negro 
question, imperialism, the American spirit, and a 
dozen other topics of no less importance and inter- 



est. The questions are hardly more than formulated 
here ; but they are so stated, with all the arguments 
pro and con regarding them, that the reader who 
approaches them with a receptive spirit leaves them 
better prepared to form judgments concerning them, 
to recognize their proportional values and their re- 
lations to one another, and to enter, properly qual- 
ified, upon the special study that appeals to him. 
Professor Shaler's writings have that rare quality 
that not only brings applause, but influences to ac- 
tion ; and the young man whose citizenship is not 
yet old enough to be commonplace must be phleg- 
matic indeed who is not led by them to rebel actively 
against some of the ills that mar our system of life, 
education, and politics. 

In a dainty little volume called 
andZZ's"^" " Kwaidan : Stories and Studies of 

Strange Things " (Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co.), Mr. Lafcadio Hearn presents some mat- 
ters of real interest, and others of little moment, 
but all told in his exquisite English, and embel- 
lished with two graceful drawings by a Japanese 
artist. " Weird Tales " appears to be the meaning 
of the book's main title, and they are mostly from 
old Japanese sources, retold apparently without a 
too literal adherence to the original, but with 
enough native words retained to color the narra- 
tive, and sometimes to puzzle the reader. Some of 
the stories have, for the thoughtful, a deeper mean- 
ing, as the tale " Of a Mirror and a Bell " and 
" The Dream of Akinosuk^." Others, as " Mu- 
jina," " A Dead Secret," and " Oshidori," are too 
slight and pointless to make a very perceptible im- 
pression. The last three chapters, "Insect Stud- 
ies," treat of butterflies, mosquitoes, and ants, and 
introduce matter that is in the sharpest contrast, 
not to say discord, with that which precedes. From 
Japanese folklore to Spencerian philosophy is a 
bold leap. One suspects that the author has raked 
his desk-drawer nearly clean to furnish forth this 
slender booklet, which, be it further noted, in- 
dulges in a prodigal display of unprinted paper. 
A genial word from the author in closing : referring 
to Dr. Howard's method of exterminating mosqui- 
toes, and to the swarms of these insects generated 
in Buddhist cemeteries, where each grave is kept 
religiously supplied with a vessel of water to quench 
the departed one's thirst, Mr. Hearn speaks a word 
for the mosquitoes (supposed to be reincarnations 
of human souls) and for himself, when he says, " I 
want to have my chance of being reborn in some 
bamboo cup, or mizutamS, whence I might issue 
softly, singing my thin and pungent song, to bite 
some people I know."

both at the same time." Such are the conclusions 
of Mr. A. C. Buell, in his " Life of William Penn" 
(Appleton). The volume differs from the usual 
biography of an American colonist in taking into 
consideration the contemporary events in England. 
In this aspect the work is very praiseworthy, and 
might well be imitated by other biographies. The 
lives of Penn have heretofore been either Quaker 
or an ti- Quaker. This author, perhaps unintention- 
ally, is unlikely to please those who eulogize the 
Friends. He considers the Quakers in England as 
'• a harmless people who did not disturb the peace 
and committed no crime," being victims to British 
ecclesiastical tyranny; but he does not conceal his 
contempt for the Quakers in America, for their 
non-resistance inconsistencies, their prejudices, and 
their illiberal policies. He deplores the loss of the 
Swedes to Delaware, harried out of the land by 
the restrictive laws of the Qaaker Assembly of 
Pennsylvania. The volume is more than a sketch 
of William Penn, — it is an outline of the found- 
ing of Pennsylvania, bringing the narrative down 
to the loss of the Penn estates in the Revolution, 
fifty-eight years after Penn's death. The style is 
somewhat amateurish, frequently descending to pre- 
tended wit, beneath the dignity of historical com- 
position. Many exclamation points are necessary 
to express the author's indignation or sarcasm. 
Notwithstanding these idiosyncrasies, it is the most 
readable sketch of Penn that has recently appeared. 

A new book Admirers of Elizabeth of the Ger- 

/rom FAizabeth man garden will agree that she made 
of the Garden. ^ ^^^^^ mistake when she went to 
Rtigen. She should have stayed at home; the gar- 
den was too charming a background to be lightly 
abandoned, and the Man of Wrath, the flowers, 
the books, the babies, and the unwelcome guests 
were better subjects for meditation than any she 
was likely to find on her travels. But having read 
of the delights of RUgen she set her heart upon 
seeing them, and decided incidentally to provide a 
guide-book to Germany's largest island for the use 
of such English and American visitors as might be 
tempted thither in her wake. With this end in 
view she has included a map in her latest book, 
" The Adventures of Elizabeth in Rugen " (Macmil- 
lan), has named the chapters geographically, and 
sandwiched occasional bits of useful information 
about roads, inns, and bath-houses into the more per- 
sonal narrative. But it would seem that Elizabeth 
was not born to be useful. In any case she quickly 
drops the role of guide, and explains how she was 
driven to give up her happy holiday in order to act 
as peace-maker between a fantastic, free-thinking 
young cousin and her elderly and very conservative 
husband, — a part which she plays without the least 
success but very entertainingly. Neither of her ben- 
eficiaries is very interesting; the Harvey-Brownes, 
who also attach themselves to her ungracious per- 
son, are conventional English folk, and the other 
"bath-guests" stodgy bourgeoise whose insufferable 



dulness makes them all too easy marks for Eliza- 
beth's gentle ridicule. As to the adventures, they 
are ingenious and amusing but overdrawn, — in- 
clined to farce, while the garden scenes were pure 
comedy. So we hope that next summer there may 
be no drought in the garden, — for it was drought 
that drove Elizabeth to seek the fresh fields and 
cooling waters of RUgen. 

Students of zoology in American 
ifzSim- colleges and universities have been 

largely dependent upon English edi- 
tions of German texts, or upon more or less ency- 
clopeedic treatises of foreign origin intended for 
those who plan to become specialists in the science. 
An epitomized treatment of the subject, suitable 
for those who dip into the science as a means of 
general culture, and at the same time serviceable as 
an introdaction to more extensive later study, 
has long been a desideratum. Professor Weysse's 
"Synoptic Text-book of Zoology" (Macmillan) 
bids fair to meet this need. The work forms a 
substantial volume of about 500 pages, and is abun- 
dantly illustrated with many classic cuts from 
former treatises and a considerable number of new 
figures from drawings and photographs. The birds 
and mammals are much more acceptably pictured 
than is usual in text-books, thanks to some excel- 
lent photographs of the admirable groups in the 
American Museum. The text is noteworthy for its 
simplicity and clearness, and the choice of subject- 
matter has been made with care. Considerable 
attention has been paid to the introduction of illus- 
trative data which bear on general biological prob- 
lems or are of economic or sanitary importance. 
The book is also free from the more technical 
terminology which only the specialist needs. The 
arrangement of the subject-matter is excellent. 
After laying down a few general principles, the 
various animal types are dealt with in detail, and 
the theoretical phases and general problems are 
discussed in the closing section. The book forms 
a clearly presented, well balanced, comprehensive, 
and accurate epitome of zoology. 

" The most remarkable of all the 
Anavtgator sensations of aerial navicfation . . . 

18 the utterly new sensation of move- 
ment in an extra dimension," observes M. A. 
Santos-Dumont in his entertaining and most in- 
structive book, " My Air-Ships " (Century Co.). 
As the first human being since Icarus who has felt 
that sensation he is entitled to be heard at length. 
" With respect of combinations of vertical and 
horizontal movements, man is absolutely without 
experience," he goes on to say ; " therefore, as all 
our sensations of movement are practically in two 
dimensions, it is the extraordinary novelty of atrial 
navigation, that it affords us experiences — not in 
the fourth dimension, it is true — but in what is 
practically an extra dimension, the third." This 
is perhaps the most remarkable statement in a

book that is assuredly the work of a remarkable 
personality. There is no doubt that this young 
Brazilian has really and practically solved the 
problem of a dirigible machine which shall carry 
him at will through the air. This marvellous feat 
has been accomplished by the expenditure of much 
money, and more patience, ingenuity, and caution 
than are apparent on the surface, but which the 
author sets forth in his narrative with more than 
Anglo-Saxon candor. At the present moment 
M. Santos-Dumont has a " stable " of four or five 
air-ships, all sufficiently practicable as to have the 
official cognizance of the French military, and he 
is quite without a rival. He does not believe in 
agro-planes or other devices that follow the model 
of bats and birds, pointing out that locomotives do 
not progress like animals, nor steamships like fish. 
The book is illustrated with reproduced photographs 
of the inventor and his various mechanisms. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Kenneth Grahame's classic of childhood, " The 
Golden Age," appeared some three or four years ago 
in a holiday edition, with illustrations by Mr. Maxfield 
Farrish. A happier combinatiou of author and illus- 
trator could hardly have been hit upon, but it was quite 
evident that the half-tone process employed in repro- 
ducing the pictures did scant justice to the beauty of 
Mr. Parrish's originals. We are glad to note that the 
publisher (John Lane) has now brought out a new 
edition of the book, with the illustrations reproduced in 
photogravure. The result is a great improvement in 
every way over the original edition, the volume being 
hardly less charming from the artistic than the literary 
standpoint. 

The volumes of the " Mermaid Series " of English 
dramatists, in their neat new issue, are coming to us 
thick and fast. The latest publications are Webster 
and Tourneur in one volume, edited bj J. A. Symonds; 
Middleton, in two volumes, edited by Mr. Swinburne; 
Massinger, in two volumes, edited by Mr. Arthur 
Symons; Ford, edited by Mr. Havelock Ellis; Hey- 
wood, edited by Mr. A. Wilson Verity ; and Dryden, in 
two volumes, edited by Mr. George Saintsbury. The 
Dryden is a new work, having never before been in- 
cluded in the series. These books are imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner. 

It is with much satisfaction that we record the pub- 
lication, by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., of Volumes 
XV. to XVII. of their «' New International Encyclo- 
paedia." These volumes complete a work of which we 
have frequently had occasion to speak in terms of 
praise, and we only now add that such use as we have 
thus far made of it for purposes of reference has more 
than borne out our first favorable impressions. There 
is certainly no better work of the kind for general and 
popular reference now upon the market, and it has the 
additional advantage over all its competitors of being 
the most strictly up-to-date. It is equally satisfactory 
from the three standpoints of conciseness, readability, 
and attractiveness of dress and illustration. It comes 
near to being an ideal work for the family and the 
school. 



NOTK8. 



Some forty heretofore unpublished letters written 
by Herbert Spencer to various American friends have 
been secured by " The Independent," and will appear 
in early issues of that journal. 

The Messrs. Scribner send us " Henry Esmond," in 
two volumes, as the latest addition to their " Kensing- 
ton " Thackeray. The books are as good to handle and 
look at as they are to read. 

The new edition of " Bryan's Dictionary of Fainters 
and Engravers," published by the Macmillan Co., has 
reached its third volume, which takes us through M in 
the alphabetical order of topics. 

An anthology of selections from the minor poets of 
the Caroline Period has been made by Prof. George 
Saintsbury, and will be published by the Oxford Claren- 
don Press in two octavo volumes. 

" Pompeii," by Herr Richard Engelmann, translated 
by Mr. Talfourd Ely, is published by the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner as the first number of a series of books devoted to 
the description of " Famous Art Cities." 

" Life and Death, and Other Legends and Stories," 
by Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz, is a small volume of brief 
sketches translated by Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, and just 
published by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish together in a 
single volume the two works, hitherto separate, of Mr. 
Charles S. Newhall on «< The Trees of Northeastern 
America " and " The Shrubs of Northeastern America." 

Among recent importations of the A. Wessels Co. is 
a " Brief History of Old English Porcelain and Its 
Manufactories," by Mr. M. L. Solon, illustrated with 
colored and tinted collotypes, and issued in a limited 
edition. 

Robert Louis Stevenson's well-known " Vailima Pray- 
ers " have been issued by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons in an exquisite little volume, printed at the Mer- 
rymount Press, and provided with a brief Introduction 
by Mrs. Stevenson. 

««A Hundred Years of Warfare, 1689-1789," by 
Mrs. Marguerite Stockman Dickson, is a reading-book 
in American history for school children, abundantly 
illustrated, and provided with many helpful aids for 
both teachers and pupils. It is a publication of the 
Macmillan Co. 

First in the field with a handbook to the St. Louis 
Exposition are Messrs, Laird & Lee, whose "Guide 
and Time-saver " to the Fair has just been issued in a 
small pocket volume. In addition to descriptive mat- 
ter regarding the Exposition and the city, there are 
pages for daily memoranda, maps, etc. 

The latest in the important series of special bibliog- 
raphies which the Library of Congress is engaged in 
publishing is a " Biblioteca Filipina " of about three 
thousand entries, compiled by Serior T. H. Pardo de 
Tavera of Manila. Introduction and notes are all in 
Spanish, which of course is familiar to all who would 
find the work of any use. 

The latest volumes in the Messrs. Appletons' series 
of illustrated reprints are " Mr. Sponge's Sporting 
Tour," with Leech's wood-cuts and colored plates, and 
a reproduction of Major's classic edition of " The Com- 
plete Angler." The latter volume will be a boon for 
the many who can never hope to possess the original 
issue of this beautiful edition.

THE DIAI. 



[May 1, 



M. M. Hachette & Cie send us a second edition of M. 
Villetard de Lagu^rie's illustrated work on " La Cored, 
Inddpendante, Russe, ou Japonaise," a timely publica- 
tion in view of the interest which the world is now tak- 
ing in the affairs of the hermit nation. 

Matthew Arnold's " Friendship's Garland," " Mixed 
Essays," and " Last Essays " are republished by the 
Macmillan Co. in a popular edition at a reduced price. 
We do not quite see why just these three volumes 
should have been selected for such a republication. 

"The Early Story of Israel," by Miss Evelyn L. 
Thomas, is a book for children published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. Illustrations from famous 
paintings add greatly to the attractiveness of this book, 
which appears in a series of " Simple Guides to Chris- 
tian Knowledge." 

"Smoke," in one volnme, and "Virgin Soil," in two, 
have just been added by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
to their beautiful subscription edition of Tourgudaieff. 
There are the usual frontispiece illustrations, and the 
introductory remarks by Miss Hapgood. Nine volumes 
of this edition are now at hand. 

Messrs. Houghton, MifQin & Co. have just published 
Part III. of Mr. Charles Sprague Sargent's supple- 
mentary work on " Trees and Shrubs," illustrative of 
the less known ligneous plants. Twenty-five species 
are described and illustrated, eight of them belong- 
ing to the genus Crataegus alone. Other genera are 
Evonymus, Acer, Lonicera, and Ligustrum, which are 
represented by from two to four species each. 

Messrs. Ernest Speight and Reginald Horace Wal- 
pole, of Teignmouth, Devonshire, England, have issued 
an alluring prospectus of a new series of choice re- 
prints for collectors and book-lovers, to be known as 
" The Saracen's Head Library." The first section of 
this enterprise will consist of reproductions of old 
works of travel, exploration, and adventure. Each 
book is to be issued in an edition limited to 300 copies, 
finely printed on handmade paper.

12mo, cloth decorative, with 6 illustrations

MR. WILSON, who is widely and favorably known 
through his " Rambles in Colonial Byways " 
and similar works, describes a series of pilgrimages 
to all the noteworthy literary landmarks of the New 
England States. These carry the reader to the birth- 
place of Longfellow and the scenes sung by Whittier, 
to the Salem of Hawthorne, to the Concord of Emer- 
son and Thoreau, to Cambridge with its memories 
of Holmes and Lowell, to Boston and the land of 
the Pilgrims, and then westward to the Berkshires, 
where Melville wrought upon his best romances 
and Bryant found inspiration for his loftiest verse. 
The work of each author is dealt with in association 
with its environment, and this method makes Mr. 
Wilson's book both a guide for the pilgrim and an 
illuminating review for the student.

JOK AI M OR. 

No Hungarian writer has achieved a more 
world-wide fame than the novelist who died 
on the sixth of last month, having just entered 
upon his eightieth year. To the popular mind, 
indeed, contemporary Hungarian literature 
means the books of Maurus Jokai and noth- 
ing else. This is due, of course, to the fact 
that his work takes chiefly the form of fiction, 
and that our modern habit of novel-reading 
makes us turn to all the corners of the civil- 
ized world for the gratification of our appetite 
for fiction. Although only a comparatively 
small fraction of Jokai's fiction has been made 
accessible to English readers, the number of 
translated volumes is still considerable, and 
they have sufficed to make the name of their 
author widely familiar to English readers. 

It is unfortunate that no systematic e£fort has 
thus far been made to give us the best of Jokai 
in some uniform shape and in accurate versions. 
The translations we have are the work of many 
hands, and in the majority of cases have been 
taken from the German rather than from the 
original — a process of transmutation which 
no work of literature can bear without losing 
much of its distinctive character. The trans- 
lations, moreover, have too frequently been 
mutilated in deference to narrow standards 
of taste or to the demands of commercially- 
minded publishers. Hence it cannot be said 
that Jokai has been given an adequate op- 
portunity to impress himself upon our public. 
Nevertheless, as already remarked, enough has 
been done to enable us to form some sort of 
an estimate of his quality, and the showing is 
fairly dazzling in point of energy and inven- 
tion, and in point of the portrayal of a people 
whose racial instincts are alien to those of the 
rest of the European world. In point of style 
and the higher artistry of composition in gen- 
eral, it must be confessed that the English 
translations afford only negative evidence that 
such characteristics are to be found in his 
writing. But then, Dumas had no style worth 
mentioning, yet we accept him as one of the 
greater French novelists by virtue of very much 
the same 9ort of ^ifts as are so profusely ex-

THE DIAL. 



[May 16, 



hibited by the famous Hungarian who has just 
died. In fact, it must be admitted that the 
latter derived no small share of his inspira- 
tion from the example of the man who made 
spectacular romance out of so many episodes 
in French history, and who was contented to 
produce his effects without any great degree 
of sublety. 

The first English translation of Jokai of 
which we find any record is " The New Land- 
lord," which appeared nearly forty years ago. 
Since then, perhaps a score of his novels have 
been given to the English-speaking public. 
Among them we may mention " Timar's Two 
Worlds," "Pretty Michal," "Black Diamonds," 
a story of the coal mines, "The Green Book," 
a romance of Eussian revolution in 1825, " The 
Nameless Castle," with a Napoleonic theme, 
" A Hungarian Nabob," picturing Hungarian 
life nearly a hundred years ago, "The Poor 
Plutocrats," " Debts of Honor," " The Baron's 
Sons," dealing with the Revolution of 1848, 
"Dr. Dumany's Wife," dealing with the 
Franco-Prussian War, "Midst the Wild Car- 
pathians," " In Love with the Czarina," "The 
Lion of Janina," a Balkan tale, " The Day of 
Wrath," and " Eyes Like the Sea," which is 
a curious mixture of invention and autobiog- 
raphy. 

As a writer of fiction, Jokai was a roman- 
ticist at heart, although he turned more and 
more to realism as the years went on. As may 
be seen from the list of titles given above, his 
range was wide, and he devoted himself with 
equal facility to historical and social themes. 
He was fond of making a display of special and 
even technical knowledge, and he flung facts 
about in a reckless fashion suggestive of the 
custom of Victor Hugo. His construction was 
frequently chaotic, and his invention was char- 
acterized by a bizarrerie which recalled the 
manner of the " Arabian Nights " rather than 
the rational methods of modern fiction. It is 
to this fantastic opulence of invention, reveal- 
ing the barbaric and oriental impulses that still 
lurk in the background of the Hungarian con- 
sciousness, that the powerful appeal which he 
made to his countrymen is largely due, although 
of course his lifelong identification with the 
cause of popular patriotism had also much to do 
with his influence. To our English-speaking 
public, these things have a curious intellectual 
interest, and little more, and we find our 
chief account in those of his works which pict- 
ure to us so intimately the strange Magyar 
civilization of modern Jijimes, witjbi it^ types and 



situations of a kind that could not be found 
anywhere else in contemporary Europe. But 
his work can never come as close to our sym- 
pathies as can the work of almost any German, 
or Scandinavian, or French, or Italian writer 
of our time, for the reason of its racial and 
intellectual remoteness from our life. 

The element of autobiography is found in a 
number of Jokai's novels, and is most evident 
in " Eyes Like the Sea," already mentioned in 
this connection. This book, which was pub- 
lished in 1890, and crowned by the Hungarian 
Academy as the best novel of the year, is 
mainly the story of the author's experiences 
in the Revolution of 1848. It tells us of his 
association with Petbfi in the leadership of 
that uprising, of his escape from capture, his 
period of hiding from his pursuers, and his 
love for Rosa Laborfalvy, the talented young 
actress who married him after saving his life 
at this year of peril. This was in 1849, and 
it is interesting to note that exactly fifty years 
later, another actress of tender years became 
his second wife, an occurrence which caused 
much excited comment among his friends, who 
did not relish the notion of marriage between 
a chit of a girl and the venerable representa- 
tive of modern Hungarian letters. 

Jokai Mor was an immensely prolific writer, 
beginning with a play at the age of seventeen, 
and keeping pen in hand for over sixty years. 
The novels alone fill hundreds of volumes, and 
besides the novels there are numerous plays, 
a history of Hungary, and a huge mass of 
journalistic and periodical production. He was 
connected editorially with one periodical or 
another nearly all his life, the last of the series 
being "The Nation," which he began to edit 
in 1894. At about this time the jubilee of 
his literary activity was celebrated with much 
ceremony, and was signalized by the publication 
of a uniform national edition of his works. He 
served for many years in the lower house of the 
Hungarian Parliament, and in his later years 
was made a member of the House of Magnates 
by imperial favor. His nearly eighty years 
were filled, in short, with almost every con- 
ceivable kind of honor, and now that he has 
died in the fulness of time, he has left behind 
him an enduring reputation in the hearts of 
all Hungarians. Even the world at large, 
however little it may know of his writings 
through personal acquaintance with them, must 
have some dim sense of the fact that one of the 
grand old men of European letters has passed 
away,

COMM UNICA TION. 

THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
I am not quite willing to accept your definition of 
democracy, as presented in your editorial in The Dial 
of April 16, as entirely satisfactory. I may, perhaps, 
agree with your contention that democracy does not 
mean « the popular election of all officers who occupy 
important civic posts." But I dissent, utterly, from 
the view therein expressed that "it really means the 
election of as few officers as possible, and the concen- 
tration in their hands of the largest practicable powers 
of appointment." Nor can I believe that " voters . . . 
are called upon to elect far too many officers, too many, 
that is, for a general exercise of intelligent judgment." 

The foregoing quotations are taken from your ed- 
itorial discussing the elective school board, and are 
designed, presumably, to have particular reference to 
that subject. Nevertheless, the school systems of this 
country have become both important and great because, 
as I insist, of their close and intimate touch with the 
masses. If there is one department of our government 
more than another in which all of the people are deeply, 
sincerely, and honestly interested, it is our public school 
system. And it is the very democratic character of the 
system which admits and encourages that popular in- 
terest. Withdraw the active management of our public 
schools from the masses, and you will have done much 
to affect unfavorably their usefulness and practical value. 

You also suggest that " Office-seeking is never dig- 
nified and is not often legitimate." On the contrary, 
office-seeking, in a democracy, should be always dig- 
nified and never illegitimate. If it is not so, more 's 
the pity. I will concede that the methods employed in 
getting office are open to strong criticism. But, if the 
"better element," so-called, of our citizenship would 
actively identify itself with public affairs, these repre- 
hensible methods would soon fail of their nefarious 
purposes. Active, intimate, and constant contact with 
public affairs, tempered by wisdom and honesty, is, or 
at least should be, a condition precedent to all living 
under a democratic form of government. 

The appointive system is not satisfactory. The 
people of this country are demanding its annihilation. 
It is both un-democratic and un-American. It does not 
make preeminent fitness a qualification for appoint- 
ment. It emphasizes favoritism. It is autocratic, dic- 
tatorial, and selfish. The election of a president, of 
our United States senators, and of our judiciary, are ex- 
amples of what the people want. And it is not too 
much to say that their demands will be met and granted 
in the not far distant future. 

I should say, keep as many officers within easy reach 
of the whole people as possible, eliminating from the 
list, perhaps, those of a purely clerical or technical 
nature. In these latter let merit win as the result of a 
fair and impartial examination. In this way will it be 
worth while to live under a democratic form of gov- 
ernment. Then, too, will democracy have a meaning 
worth having. DuANE Mowry.

Massachusetts' Wak Governor.* 



In Mr. Pearson's Life of John A. Andrew 
we have the carefully drawn portrait of an 
extremely interesting, forceful, and lovable 
character, and the detailed account of a most 
noteworthy contribution toward the freeing of 
the slave and the triumph of the Union cause 
in our civil war. In the rather surprising lack 
of any previous biography of Andrew approach- 
ing this in fulness, Mr. Pearson's work will be 
welcomed as supplying a want and as probably 
the final and authoritative life of Massachu- 
setts' famous war governor. 

The opening paragraph of the preface de- 
clares the impossibility of presenting Andrew 
fully to the reader, transparent and void of 
guile though the man's nature is felt to be. 
Manifestly this is to be taken for granted in 
any biography. Who can analyze and under- 
stand his own character, not to speak of an- 
other's ? However, the author appears to have 
spared no pains in the ransacking of all sorts 
of documents that might throw light on his 
subject. " The thirty thousand or more pages " 
of Andrew's letters have been read by him, or 
at least this is distinctly implied in the Preface. 
Old friends of the Governor have been inter- 
viewed, contemporary prints of all kinds ex- 
amined, and, in short, nothing seems to have 
been neglected that could yield its bit of truth 
and realism and graphic force to the final re- 
sult of years of faithful labor. 

Entering thus heartily into his subject, it is 
inevitable that the author should, for the time 
being, view the world to some extent through 
the eyes of his hero. Hence we have, for ex- 
ample, a presentation of Lincoln which is not 
entirely that of an ardent admirer. In those 
times that tried Northern men's souls, espe- 
cially in the year preceding the Emancipation 
Proclamation, and in the summer following it, 
Andrew's strenuous exertions for the cause 
were not always in harmony with the more 
cautious policy of the administration at Wash- 
ington, and in his vigorous recruiting of volun- 
teers for the field he repeatedly found himself 
entangled in the red tape of the war depart- 
ment. " Besides doing my proper work," he 
writes in the darkest hour of the war, " I am

sadly but firmly trying to help organize some 
movement, if possible, to save the Prest. from 
the infamy of ruining his country." Yet when 
the trying time was past, as before it had be- 
gun, Andrew was generously disposed to utter 
none but words of praise for Lincoln. " You 
ask me what Abraham Lincoln is like," he 
said in a speech soon after his return from the 
nominating convention ai Chicago. " My eyes 
were never visited with the vision of a human 
face in which more transparent honesty and 
more benignant kindness were combined with 
more of the intellect and firmness which belong 
to masculine humanity. I would trust my case 
with the honesty and with the intellect and 
with the heart and with the brain of Abraham 
Lincoln as a lawyer; and I would trust my 
country's cause in the care of Abraham Lin- 
coln as its chief magistrate, while the wind 
blows and the water runs." And in communi- 
cating to the legislature the sad news of the 
assassination, Andrew spoke eloquently of 
" the MAN on whom the people hung with 
fonder hope and confidence than had ever been 
exercised within the memory of the generation 
to which we belong." Of Lincoln as presi- 
dent he added: '^ We should still be enabled to 
challenge all human history to produce the 
name of a ruler more just, unselfish, or unre- 
sentful." 

Not the least interesting chapter of the book 
is that which sets forth the relations between 
Andrew and one of the most notorious "politi- 
cal generals " of the war. Curiously enough 
it was Andrew himself who launched the irre- 
pressible Butler, vehement political opponent 
though he was, on his remarkable military 
career. He was appointed as the fittest of six 
militia brigadiers to the command of the first 
regiments hurried off by the Governor at the 
earliest call from Washington. The way in 
which he thereafter made himself a thorn in 
Andrew's side and embroiled him for a while 
with the war department, makes one smile now 
as at the ingenious and naughty devices of a 
pert child who laughs at correction. Yet it was 
plainly no laughing matter for the Governor 
at the time. 

The story of Andrew's nomination for the 
governorship has probably never before been 
so fully told in print as by Mr. Pearson. It 
was expected that Governor Banks, who rep- 
resented the conservative section of the Repub- 
lican party, would serve another year. He 
however had secretly accepted the presidency 
of the Illinois Central Kailroad and was plan- 



ning to step out, but designed to publish his 
intentions too late for Andrew's friends to 
rally around their candidate, and not too late 
for the Banks men to unite upon Henry L. 
Dawes, then in Congress, as his successor on 
Beacon Hill. From ex-Governor Claflin Mr. 
Pearson now learns how the secret leaked out. 

" On Thursday night Governor Banks and William 
Claflin, the chairman of the Republican State Com- 
mittee, were travelling by boat from New York to 
Boston. In the evening their talk of politics was gen- 
eral; but the next morning on the train Banks showed 
Claflin the draft of the letter which he was to send 
him later in the day. After leaving the train, Claflin 
went at once to Charles Sumner's house in Hancock 
street, and told his story. 'Give me my boots,' ex- 
claimed Sumner, starting up. 'John A. Andrew must 
be the next governor of Massachusetts.' Though 
Andrew's friends lost no time in g^etting to work, they 
could afford to stop now and then to denounce to each 
other the trick of the < little joker.' " 

Andrew's nomination and election were both 
by large majorities. 

Of Andrew's many public addresses fre- 
quent extracts are given ; but, as he relied so 
largely on the inspiration of the moment and 
the potent influence of a great audience, his 
speeches suffer somewhat from being printed. 
The force of their impetuous eloquence may, 
it is true, be dimly surmised even as they 
stand in cold type, and here and there a ring- 
ing sentence is recognized as one that must 
have evoked tumults of popular applause. 
Thus, in addressing a Methodist camp-meet- 
ing on the island of Martha's Vineyard, he 
thrilled his audience with the often-quoted 
words : " I know not what record of sin 
awaits me in the other world, but this I know, 
that I was never mean enough to despise any 
man because he was ignorant, or because he 
was poor, — or because he was black." In 
estimating Andrew's services to his country — 
there is no space here to indicate what he 
achieved for his state or to name the many 
good causes he promoted — we may quote what 
is said of his heroic exertions in the summer 
of 1863. 

« The tide of Northern fortune had ebbed incredibly 
low; it seemed that it must ebb still lower. The army 
was shattered in strength and spirit; foreign interven- 
tion appeared certain; there were no fresh troops. By 
the force of human wills the tide must be turned; the 
people must be made to enlist, to put into the renewed 
prosecution of the war all their resources of money and 
life. To help create in his people the will to do this 
was Andrew's task. The story of his labors to this end 
all through the summer, one day following another with 
its crowded confusion of work, is largely the chronicle 
of a dull office routine; yet through this toil of body 
and of spirit the end he wrought for came to pass."

The great work he did, too, in raising colored 
regiments and in finally securing white man's 
pay for the negro soldier, must not be over- 
looked. 

Upon closing this engrossing biography the 
reader feels that he has been in the company 
of one with whom simple truth was indeed his 
utmost skill. Unstudied straightforwardness, 
disregard of the consequences of right conduct, 
generous warm-heartedness, scorn of all mean- 
ness, and, despite his impetuosity, an unusual 
staying power in every arduous undertaking, — 
these are the qualities that shine resplendent 
in John A. Andrew. His capacity for work, 
both the larger task of directing others and 
the more patience-trying personal attention to 
minute details, was extraordinary. No wonder 
he broke down at forty-nine. " A warm heart 
and a cool head " are the attributes ascribed to 
him more than once by the author. A warm 
heart he certainly had, but his generous im- 
pulses often hurried him into courses that 
appeared unwise to the sober understanding 
of his friends. Yet his may have been that 
higher wisdom of the heart which refuses to 
count the cost. 

In a work showing such evidences of thor- 
ough preparation and such literary excellence 
one is reluctant to search for errors. Never- 
theless, dealing as it must with many matters 
of party politics, the book cannot expect the 
cordial assent of every reader to every sen- 
tence. Henry Wilson is handled not exactly 
with gloves in the account of the gubernatorial 
contest of 1854, when " the astute politician,'' 
according to Mr. Pearson, " in all probability 
sold out " his supporters to the Know-Nothing 
party. Wilson's whole career is so at variance 
with such treachery that, though the circum- 
stances may look suspicious, his admirers must 
hesitate to convict without more conclusive evi- 
dence. A statement, too, not strictly accurate 
occurs in the narrative at this point with 
regard to the party in question. The writer 
names 1854 as the year when it " came myste- 
riously upon the scene," whereas the Know- 
Nothing movement had made itself manifest 
two years before, although its first important 
victories were won in 1864. A surprising 
statement is made in reference to that unde- 
niably astute politician and sympathizer with 
the South, Caleb Gushing. To save appear- 
ances, when all loyal men of note in the state 
were pressing their services on the Governor, 
Cushing joined the procession and applied for 
a military command, which was very naturally 



and justly refused him by the man he had so 
actively opposed in the past. But the author 
writes : " We of this day, knowing from the 
course of events the sincerity of Cushing's 
offer, cannot help feeling, perhaps to excess, 
what seem to be the cruelty and the injustice 
of Andrew's refusal." This heart-throb of 
commiseration few will share. Cushing was 
a turncoat, if ever there was one. Some will 
remember that when Grant, who had found 
him a useful tool, wished to make him chief 
justice, the timely production of a damaging 
letter from Cushing to Jefferson Davis com- 
pelled the withdrawal of the nomination. 

An especially attractive feature of the book 
must receive brief mention. Not a few of that 
memorable body of men who held up the Gov- 
ernor's hands in those trying times are re- 
peatedly introduced. Sumner, Phillips, Howe, 
Forbes, George L. Stearns, Henry Lee, ^ 
glimpses of these and many others add interest 
to Mr. Pearson's pages. A word of praise, in 
conclusion, should be spoken for the excellent 
apparatus of footnotes and index, and for 
the clear portraits and facsimiles interspersed 

through the book. t. t^ t.

Two Poetic Dramas.* 



As Dr. Richard Strauss has endeavored to 
embody a metaphysical system in a symphonic 
composition, so Mr. Thomas Hardy has sought 
to express a philosophy of history in a closet- 
drama. Both feats are quite impossible of 
achievement upon the terms of the arts respec- 
tively involved, yet both produce deeply inter- 
esting results because of the powerful person- 
alities which they exhibit. The symphonic 
poem throws little light upon the doctrines of 
Nietzsche-Zoroaster, but much upon the inner 
workings of the composer's mind; the histor- 
ical drama likewise adds little to our insight 
into the Napoleonic wars, but does much to 
illuminate the point of view from which its 
author contemplates the significant happenings 
in the tragi-comedy of human life. It takes 
for its motto the words : 

" And I heard sounds of insult, shame, and wron^. 
And trumpets blown for wars."

It might even better have taken Matthew 
Arnold's familiar lines about Heine : 

" The Spirit of the world, 
Beholding the absurdity of men — 
Their vaunts, their feats — let a sardonic smile 
For one short moment, wander o'er his lips." 

The word " short " in the quotation would 
hardly be applicable, for Mr. Hardy's porten- 
tous production extends to nineteen acts and 
one hundred and thirty scenes, but the " sar- 
donic smile" is everywhere in evidence, and 
" the spirit of the world " is one of the speak- 
ing characters of the drama. 

The mere enumeration of these characters 
fills four pages of print, and one of the four 
is a list of the " phantom intelligences " who 
hover about the scene, and comment upon the 
action after the fashion of a Greek chorus. 
There is the Ancient Spirit of the Years, the 
Spirit of Pities, the Spirit of Kumour, and 
Spirits Sinister and Ironic, besides the Shade 
of the Earth and a sufficient number of Ke- 
cording Angels. These ideal shapes are not 
kept mostly outside the main action, as in 
" Faust," but mingle with it at every point, 
and penetrate the scene with their intelligence. 
Their part is so important that we must quote 
in full the author's explanation of how he came 
to use them and what he intended should be 
their function in his artistic plan. 

" It was thought proper to introduce, as supernatural 
spectators of the terrestrial drama, certain impersonated 
abstractions, or Intelligences, called Spirits. They are 
intended to be taken by the reader for what they may 
be worth as contrivances of the fancy merely. Their 
doctrines are but tentative, and are advanced with little 
eye to a systematized philosophy warranted to lift ' the 
burthen of the mystery ' of this unintelligible world. 
The chief thing hoped for them is that they and their 
utterances may have dramatic plausibility enough to 
procure for them, in the words of Coleridge, * that will- 
ing suspension of disbelief for the moment which con- 
stitutes poetic faith.' The wide prevalence of the 
Monistic theory of the Universe forbade, in this twen- 
tieth century, the importation of Divine personages 
from any antique Mythology as ready-made sources or 
channels of Causation, even in verse, and excluded the 
celestial machinery of, say, < Paradise Lost,' as peremp- 
torily as that of the < Iliad ' or the * Eddas.' And the 
abandonment of the masculine pronoun in allusions to 
the First or Fundamental Energy seemed a necessary 
and logical consequence of the long abandonment by 
thinkers of the anthropomorphic conception of the 
same." 

This explanation, which is also a confession of 
faith (of a lack of faith, some will say, with 
too great a readiness to jump at conclusions), 
is absolutely essential to any comprehension of 
Jthe mood or temper in which the drama has 
been wrought ; it sets the work apart from 



those others which likewise make use of super- 
natural machinery, but which use it in such a 
way as to give at least temporary credence to 
the concrete forms in which the outworn re- 
ligions have shaped forth their envisagement 
of life's inmost meaning. 

A great historical period, then, viewed on 
the one hand with the eye of the most minute 
and relentless realism, and on the other seen 
absolutely sub specie ceternitatis, is what Mr. 
Hardy has given us in " The Dynasts," of 
which the first six acts are now published. 
That the eternal aspect of his theme, rather 
than the temporal aspect, is what chiefly con- 
cerns him, is a fact of which we are not per- 
mitted to doubt for a moment. He makes this 
perfectly clear in the scene of Napoleon's Cor- 
onation at Milan, where the dumb show of 
ceremonial becomes the subject of spiritual 
comment after the following fashion : 

« Spirit of the Pities. 
" What is the creed that these rich rites disclose? 

Spirit of the Years. 
" A local thing called Christianity, 
Which the wild dramas of this wheeling sphere 
Include, with divers others such, in dim, 
Fathetical, and brief parentheses; 
Beyond whose reach, uninfluenced, unconcerned, 
The systems of the suns go sweeping on 
With all their many-mortaled planet train 
In mathematic roll unceasingly. 

Spirt/ of the Pities. 
" I did not recognize it here, forsooth; 
Though in its early, lovingkindly days 
Of gracious purpose it was much to me." 

From this point of view the mightiest figures 
in human history shrink to mere manikins, and 
the men who have convulsed the world seem 
no more than puppets controlled by a mysteri- 
ous and inexorable destiny. 

Perhaps three-fourths of the present volume 
is in the form of verse — blank verse for the 
dialogue of mortals, lyrical measures of vari- 
ous forms for the discourse of spirits. But the 
verse, whatever its form, is such as to defy all 
the conventional canons of poetic diction, being 
devoid of grace and melody, and having in 
their stead only sheer intellectual weight and 
merciless logic. Two more illustrations may 
be given besides those already introduced for 
illustration of the author's thought. Here are 
the words spoken by Pitt upon hearing the 
news of Austerlitz : 
" O God that I should live to see this day! 

* Defeated — the Allies — quite overthrown 

At Austerlitz — last week.' — Where 's Austerlitz? 

— But what avails it where the place is now; 

What corpse is curious on the longitude

And situation of his cemetery ! . . . 

The Austrians and the Russians overcome, 

That vast adventuring army is set free 

To bend unhindered strength against our shores. . . . 

So do my plans through all these plodding years 

Announce them built in vain ! . . . 

His heel on Europe, monarchies in chains 

To France, I am as though I had not been." 

And here is part of the antiphonal song of the 
Recording Angels, chanted to "aerial music": 
" Feeble-framed dull unresolve, unresourcefulness. 
Sat in the halls of the Kingdom's high Councillors, 
Whence an nntactical torpid despondency 
■ Weighed as with winter the national mind." 

Surely such dactyls as these were never shaped 
before ; that they are the utterance of an an- 
gelic voice seems to be one of the deepest of 
the ironies in the author's whole ironic scheme. 
Clearly this work must be taken on Mr. 
Hardy's own terms ; the ordinary terms of 
literary art would compel its summary rejec- 
tion, and it is quite impressive enough to force 
us to set those terms aside. 

The conception of the historical Napoleon 
here presented is essentially just. It is that of 
the hero perverted until he has become the 
" man of mere traditions," that of the leader 
with whom 

«« The large potencies 
Instilled into his idiosyncrasy — 
To throne fair Liberty in Privilege's room — 
Are taking taint, and sink to common plots 
For his own gain." 

The three figures of Napoleon, Nelson, and 
Pitt stand out far above the mass of historical 
characters that Mr. Hardy has brought into 
his drama. Women hardly appear in the fore- 
ground of the action, and few of them are even 
named in the long list of dramatis personce. 
The section of the work now published may 
be summed up historically with the five words 
Milan, Boulogne, Ulm, Trafalgar, and Auster- 
litz. The Peninsular War will be the central 
theme of the second section, with Jena and 
Wagram for subjects of secondary interest. 
Moscow, Elba, and Waterloo will be the cap- 
ital headings of the third and concluding sec- 
tion, followed by an epilogue in a Wessex 
village, and an " after scene " in " the over- 
world," to match the " fore scene " with which 
the work is opened. The programme which 
gives us this outline ends with a note to the ef- 
fect that the remaining sections are "in hand," 
although " their publication is not guaranteed." 
We trust that they may see the light. So gran- 
diose a plan, conceived by so forceful and dis- 
tinguished a writer, could not suffer frustration 
without the world's being left the poorer. 



An undertaking no less ambitious than that 
of Mr. Hardy, and one which, if of less weight 
as an embodiment of ripened wisdom, is of far 
greater weight as an expression of the poetic 
imagination, is Mr. William Vaughn Moody's 
trilogy on the Promethean theme. Our opin- 
ion of " The Masque of Judgment," holding it 
to be one of the most extraordinary produc- 
tions of recent literature — a poem in so high 
a sense that it may be doubted whether its 
author has a peer among the younger singers 
of our race — was expressed in these pages 
three years ago. It now appears that " The 
Masque of Judgment " was planned as the in- 
termediate section of a three-fold drama, of 
which "The Fire-Bringer," recently published, 
constitutes the first part, and which some as 
yet unnamed and unimaginable work (as far 
as the public is concerned) will bring to a con- 
clusion. With two-thirds of this drama already 
in our possession, we trust that no untoward 
and malign fate will deprive us of the comple- 
tion of a production which offers every promise 
of enduring life. 

^schylus, Goethe, and Shelley — these are 
the names that any treatment of the Prome- 
theus myth must bring to mind. Now there 
are two ways in which the great names of lit- 
erature may be brought to mind. One of 
them is by the appalling contrast between the 
work of genius for which they stand and the 
work of some mediocre modern talent that 
seeks their shadow ; the other is by the sug- 
gestion of an evident kinship that makes it not 
altogether preposterous to speak in the same 
breath of the masters and some modern disci- 
ple who has caught his inspiration from their 
teaching. We have no notion of discovering 
a new iEschylus, or Goethe, or Shelley, in Mr. 
Moody, but we make bold to say that he has, 
greatly daring, dealt so worthily with their 
famous theme that we may not fairly charge 
him with rashness ; that he has, to use a figure 
naturally suggested by that theme, filched some 
spark of fire from their heaven for our use. 

" The Fire-Bringer " opens upon a world 
made desolate by the wrath of Zeus. The 
floods have swept over it, destroying the race 
of men, save only the few rescued by Deuka- 
lion's ark. The stone men and women sprung 
from the " big seed " cast by Deukalion and 
Pyrrha have indeed in a way repeopled the 
world, but they are stolid figures, unawakeued 
to the life of the spirit, and groping about over 
an earth made dark by the cloud-pall that still 
overhangs it, and made dismal by the ooze

and slime left by the " black ebb " of the 
waters. Prometheus has in vain ranged the 
world in search of a spark of fire, and has 
even scaled the heavens only to be baffled 
in his quest. But his soul is still indomitable, 
and the love and faith of Pandora bring to 
him a gleam of cheer and strengthen his high 
purpose. Prometheus thus describes his first 
fruitless search: 

" I clambered down 
Old earthquake-cloven rifts and monstrous chasms 
Where long ago the stripling Titans peered 
At play and dared not venture, — found me out 
Flint-stones so buried in disastrous rock 
I thought the Darkener sure had passed themby; 
But not a spark lived in them. Past the walls 
Rhipean, and the Arimaspian caves, 
I sought the far hyperborean day, 
But not a banner of their rustling light 
Flapped through the sagging sky, nor did the Fates 
Once fling their gleaming shuttles east or west. 
By Indian Nysa and the Edonian fount 
Of Hsemus long I lurked, in hope to find 
Young Dionysus as he raced along 
And wrest his pine-torch from him, or to snare 
Some god-distracted dancing segipan. 
And from his garland crush a wine of fire 
To light the passion of the world again 
And fill man's veins with music; but there went 
A voice of sighing through the ghostly woods, 
And up the mountain pastures in the mist 
Desolate creatures sorrowed for the god. 
Across the quenched ^gean, where of old 
The shining islands sang their stasimon, 
Forever chorusing great hymns of light 
Round Delos, through the driving dark I steered 
To seek Hepbsestos on his Lemnian mount; 
But found him not. His porches were o'erthrown, 
His altar out, and round his faded peak 
The toilM Cyclops, bowing huge and dim, 
Uncouthly mourned." 

But in the hour of his deepest dejection, new 
hope comes to the Titan with the advent of 
Pandora, who brings him a fennel stalk ; he 
receives it as the token of a fresh endeavor, 
and the first act closes as he departs 

" To find somewhere through the piled gloom 
A mountain-path to unimagined day." 

In the second act, the few maddened sur- 
vivors of the deluge, in their last frantic effort 
to appease the anger of Zeus, come bringing 
the child Alcyone, and press about Deukalion 
and Pyrrha, demanding of them also the sacri- 
fice of their child ^olus as a supreme offering 
upon the altar. Deukalion at first resists, then 
reluctantly consents, and the sacrifice is about 
to be consummated when Pyrrha interposes, 
and declares that the knife shall not yet fall, — 

" Not till Prometheus comes or makes a sign! " 
In the hour of heavy suspense, the voice of 
Pandora is heard singing down the slopes, and 



her appearance is eagerly awaited. Then fol- 
lows this supremely beautiful scene: 

"A Man's Voice. 
" Take heed there to the lad where he hath risen 
His height upon the altar ! And the maid 
Is risen. Look to them ! 

Pyrrha. 

Children ! iBolus t 
What is 't with you ? What search ye in the heavens? 
Or to what high thing do your spirits strain 
And your hands tremble up ? 

JEolus and Alcyone (looking and pointing upward). 
The stars ! The stars t 
{Pause.) 

Deukalion. 
Why hath so deep a hush fallen on the night ? 
I heard a whispering cry. What whisper they ? 

Pyrrha. 
iEolus pointed — whispering of the stars. 

^olus. 
iEolus — stars. Pyrrha ! 

Pyrrha. 

With thee ! 

Deukalion, 

Speakest thon 
Of stars ? 

Pyrrha. 
Ay, so he whispered t 

Deukalion. 

Thou — and thou ? 
Pyrrha. 
Nothing, nothing. My soul was as a lake 
Spread out in utter darkness; to its depth 
There pierced a silvery trembling 

Deukalion. 

Look again. 
Wife, cease to pray ! Look out ag^in ! 

Pyrrha. 

The dark 
Gathers and flees, and the wide roof of night 
Leans in as it would break; the mountainous gloom 
Unmoors, and streameth on us like a sea. 
O Earth, lift up thy gates ! It is the stars I 
It is the star^ I It is the ancient stars ! 
It is the young and everlasting stars ! " 

And then there follow page upon page of 
glorious poetry, the rapturous expression of 
the restoration to the world of light and life 
and joy. And then at last the sun streams 
out over the earth, dazzling to the long-dark- 
ened eyes of the survivors, and intolerable to 
the eyes of the men sprung from the clods of 
Deukalion's sowing. And the song of Pan- 
dora is heard again, and then the voice of 
Prometheus, 

" Thou gavest me the vessel ; it is filled." 
and the answering voice of Pandora, 

« I am the vessel, and with thee 't is filled." 
And then Prometheus appears, and gives to

the children now saved from death the fennel 
stalk with its priceless treasure of fire. 
« Unto this twain, man-child and woman-child, 

I give the passion of this element; 

This seed of longing, substance of this love; 

This power, this parity, this annihilation. 

Let their hands light the altar of the world. 

'T is yours forever. I have brought it home ! " 

The third and closing act of the drama 
brings retribution to the daring saviour of 
mankind. The scene is the tomb of Deuka- 
lion, whither the remains of the king have 
been borne to rest beside his stranded ark on 
the mountain side. A chorus of old men is fol- 
lowed by choruses of girls and young women, 
who sing of " the dark peace-giver, Thanatos," 
and of the mysterious whisperings in their ears 
of the winged Eros. The funeral cortege de- 
parts, leaving the mourners beside the tomb. 
And then amid gathering clouds, and thunders, 
and the flashes of angry lightning the pursuit 
of Prometheus is foreshadowed. Pandora ap- 
pears questioning, — 

« Deemest thou 
That he will yield himself unmurmuring up, 
Or will he make wild war along the peaks ? " 

To the cry Prometheus himself answers, sud- 
denly appearing and clasping her in his arms. 

« Be comforted ; it is established sure. 
Light shall arise from light, day follow day. 
Season meet season, with all lovely signs 
And portents of the year. These shall not fail ; 
From their appointed dance no star shall swerve, 
Nor mar one accent of one whirling strophe 
Of that unfathomed chorus that they sing 
Within the porch and laughing house of Life, 
Which Time and Space and Change, bright caryatids. 
Do meanwhile pillar up. These shall not fail; 
But O, these were the least I brought you home! 
The sun whose rising and whose going down 
Are joy and grief and wonder in the heart; 
The moon whose tides are passion, thought, and will ; 
The signs and portents of the spirit year, — 
For these, if you would keep them, you must strive 
Morning and night against the jealous gods 
With anger, and with laughter, and with love; 
And no man hath them till he brings them down 
With love, and rage, and laughter from the heavens, — 
Himself the heavens, himself the scornful gods. 
The sun, the sun-thief, and the flaming reed 
That kindles new the beauty of the world." 

At the end of the long monologue which is 
thus begun, Prometheus departs to meet the 
doom which he clearly foresees, sustained in 
spirit by the thought of what he has done for 
the race of men, and by his memory of Pan- 
dora, to whom he speaks these pregnant last 
words: "There where I go thou art." And 
as darkness drifts deeper and deeper over the 
scene, we hear the song of Pandora : 



" A thousand sons, nailed in pain 
On the blown world's plunging prow. 
That seeks across the eternal main, — 
Down whatever storms we drift. 
What disastrous headlands lift, 
Festal lips, triumphant brow, 
Light us with thy joy, as now ! " 

And amid the peace of the following starlight, 
and the flush of the succeeding dawn, this 
lyrical drama ends with a hymn to Apollo, 
chanted by a chorus of young men coming up 
the mountain slope. 

«« For thou alone, O thou alone art he 
Who settest the prisoned spirit free, 
And sometimes leadest the rapt soul on 
Where never mortal thought has gone; 
Till by the ultimate stream 
Of vision and of dream 
She stands 

With startled eyes and outstretched hands. 
Looking where other suns rise over other lands. 
And rends the lonely skies with her prophetic scream." 

After these quoted illustrations, mere prose 
can find little to say that is worth recording. 
The work which has thus been passed under 
swift review seems to us to have fairly scaled 
the heights which it has attempted, to have 
reached with unflagging wing that thin upper 
air to which few poets find access, and in which 
still fewer can breathe. The song is indeed a 
thing not of earth, and some may find a cause 
for reproach in this very fact ; to us it is rather 
a cause for thankfulness, since it shows us that 
even in this prosaic modern world of ours the 
poetic spirit may still achieve something of the 
accent and the utterance of the great voices of 
the past. William Morton Payne. 



Cogent Essats on Various Themes.* 

If Mr. William Garrott Brown were not 
already known to a wide public as a conscien- 
tious and sometimes fairly brilliant essayist, 
he would certainly deserve to gain that repu- 
tation on the strength of his recently published 
book, " The Foe of Compromise." In this vol- 
ume we have a collection of four genial essays, 
three of which appeared originally in " The 
Atlantic Monthly," the fourth being accounted 
for as the outgrowth of an address delivered 
somewhat more than two years ago before 
the Harvard Memorial Society. The essays 
exhibit such diversity of theme that one can 
hardly hope to characterize them as a group, 
save perhaps to say that while here and there

they tend a bit toward abstruseness, their 
thought is usually cogent and their style of 
expression straightforward and pleasing. 

In the title essay, Mr. Brown sets out to 
discover what is that force which " in one man 
keeps alive his whole desire, his undiminished 
aspiration, while in another man, after a brief 
struggle, a faint beating of its wings, it yields 
to necessity, to circumstance "; in other words, 
what is the foe of compromise, — the elemental 
power which compels the neighbor on my right, 
often to his hurt, always to his discomfiture, to 
scorn to temporize or concede in his dealings 
with the world, but which in the more easy- 
going neighbor on my left rarely succeeds in 
even rufiBing the surface waters of his life. In 
the nature of the case, no very exact solu- 
tion of the problem can be arrived at. Many 
exceedingly interesting observations are re- 
corded, but what the thing itself really is, as 
Mr. Brown confesses, cannot even be described, 
much less defined. " But when it rises up, out 
of the nothingness within, the man will know 
it for his very inmost self. Ideal is not its 
name, for ideals are many, and they change ; 
the thing I mean is one and constant. It is, 
rather, the champion and tutelary god of all 
ideals. Nor is it aspiration, but rather the 
monitor that bids us always aspire, and largely. 
Nor is it desire, but rather a royal parent to 
desires. There is, in fact, no name for the 
thing I mean. Let us call it merely the foe 
— the hidden foe — of compromise." It is the 
esprit de resistance which again and again 
makes tragedies of human life and gloats over 
the deed, yet which at its worst possesses a 
certain wild charm and at its best commands 
the universal admiration of the thoughtful. 

In " A Defence of American Parties," the 
author considers at some length the assertion 
of Bryce and De Tocqueville that political 
parties in the United States are not divided 
by principles of fundamental importance, but 
rest only on tradition and matters of expe- 
diency, and seeks to determine whether or not 
the present-day party system which so domi- 
nates us is really meaningless. After a fair 
enumeration of the weaknesses of the system, 
argument is skilfully produced to establish the 
thesis that '' parties do stand for a right and 
necessary division of the American people." 
Mr, Brown's historical characterization of the 
Republican and Democratic parties, while brief, 
is worthy of a careful reading. 

The next essay has for its subject "The 
Task of the American Historian," and while 



not a formal review, was evidently prompted 
by the appearance a year or more ago of Presi- 
dent Wilson's " History of the United States," 
Mr. John Fiske's " Essays, Historical and 
Literary," and the seventh volume of the 
" Cambridge Modern History," dealing with 
the United States. Mr. Brown is himself a man 
of some experience in the writing of history, 
and his characterizations of such historians as 
Wilson, Fiske, Justin Winsor, Parkman, and 
Lord Acton, are highly suggestive. As a man 
of letters, Mr. Brown manifestly approves of 
President Wilson's habit of regarding history 
as a branch of literature rather than of science. 
The closing essay, " The Great Occasions 
of an American University," is easily the most 
interesting, if not the most scholarly, of the 
series. The university is Harvard, and the 
great occasions are the visit of Governor 
Hutchinson in 1771, that of Washington when 
about to take command of the American army 
in 1775, that of La Fayette in 1824, that of 
the doughty Westerner, Andrew Jackson, in 
1833, the celebration of the two-hundredth 
anniversary of the college in 1836, the re- 
union of Harvard survivors of the Civil War 
in 1865, and the funeral of Phillips Brooks in 
1893. As official curator of Harvard records 
in recent years, Mr. Brown has had an invalu- 
able opportunity to acquaint himself with both 
the history and the tradition of the university, 
all the way from the Puritan days to the pres- 
ent. In this essay we have the very cream of 
his knowledge of the subject. There is a fine 
appreciation not only of the more picturesque 
and striking personages who have touched the 
life of the university, but also of the aspira- 
tions, struggles, tragedies, and triumphs of the 
great throng of college men who do not be- 
come famous. Mr. Brown has a wholesome 
philosophy, and his essay cannot fail to inspire 
in the reader both a deeper respect for 
America's favored seats of learning and a 
more thorough-going sympathy with the great 
work sought to be accomplished in them.

Ax American Man of Actions 



When we get far enough away from the 
literature of the present period to see it fairly, 
we shall probably come to the conclusion that 
one of its most attractive features is its biog- 
raphical treatment of the leaders in the various 
paths of our national development during the 
past century. Such series as the " American 
Statesmen," and the " American Men of Let- 
ters," deservedly occupy a high place in our con- 
sideration ; but we have in mind particularly 
the more spontaneous output of Autobiograph- 
ies, Recollections, Memoirs, etc., represented 
by such books as Stillman's " Autobiography 
of a Journalist," Mr. James's " William Wet- 
more Story and his Friends," General Gordon's 
" Reminiscences of the Civil War," and Sena- 
tor Hoar's "Autobiography of Seventy Years." 
The level of literature of this class produced 
during the past few years has certainly been 
high, and to say that any particular work stands 
distinctly above that level is high praise indeed. 
And yet we do not hesitate to predict that such 
will be the verdict of intelligent readers gener- 
ally with reference to the Memoirs of Henry 
Villard. It is true that the work was left unfin- 
ished, and as a consequence is ill proportioned ; 
but these formal blemishes leave upon the 
reader in the end nothing but regret that death 
caused anything to be sacrificed from what the 
author had it in his heart to tell. The success- 
ful autobiographer must have had either un- 
usual power to see, or unusual power to bring 
things to pass. Mr. Villard had both, and the 
story that he has left gives to the reader the 
full advantage of both. 

The power of Mr. Villard to see is shown 
most clearly in the details of his career as a 
newspaper correspondent, from 1856 through 
the greater part of the Civil War. To anyone 
acquainted with the general character of the 
man, it is needless to say that as a war corre- 
spondent Mr. Villard did not follow the prin- 
ciples and methods of the modern sensational 
journalism, which the Civil War did so much 
to develop. Commanders whose armies he 
accompanied quickly learned that their plans 
and purposes could safely be discussed in his 
presence, for neither his honor nor his patriot- 
ism would allow him to give news to the public 
prematurely for the paltry prize of a newspa- 
per " scoop." That he was able more than once

to deliver news of the highest importance either 
to his paper or to the authorities at Washington^ 
in advance of all others was due simply to 8%. 
perior industry and insight, never to method^ 
in the slightest degree reprehensible. It is easy 
to see the value to his memoirs of the confiden- 
tial relations with officers which such a reputa- 
tion permitted him to maintain. They were 
conscious of no necessity of assuming any spe- 
cial disguise in his presence, and so he saw 
them as they really were, whether in their 
weakness or in their strength. All this gives 
high authority to his expressions of opinion 
concerning the general character, or conduct 
in specific cases, of the commanders who came 
under his observation ; and he has shown no 
hesitation in making his opinions known when 
occasion offers. He had set a very high stand- 
ard of completeness and carefulness for the 
military portion of his memoirs, checking him- 
self at every point by thorough examination, 
of the official records, both Federal and Con- 
federate. Especially was it his desire to give 
a complete account of the operations about 
Chickamauga and Chattanooga, and the thor- 
ough preparation which he thought necessary 
for this portion might serve as a valuable les- 
son to many a professional historian. But all 
this took time as well as effort, and failing 
health broke the story off abruptly with the 
description of the '^ Battle above the Clouds." 
But it was not the military record alone 
which suffered from this failure of health ; to 
the same cause is due the fact that we get but 
a hurried compendium of the entire subsequent 
period, covering the writer's remarkable and 
romantic career as an assistant in the develop- 
ment of the great Northwest. It is intimated 
in the Preface, however, that a detailed a^ 
count of this peculiar feature of his career 
may yet be given to the public by his family. 
In the brief sketch that he found time to pre- 
pare, Mr. Villard's candor forbade any attempt 
to use his brilliant successes in such a way as 
to blind the eyes of the uninformed reader to 
the attendant failures. Mistakes of judgment 
there were, bringing severe loss to others, and 
to himself not only painful loss but still more: 
painful abuse and misrepresentation of motives; 
but the mistakes are pointed out with the same 
unswerving accuracy as the brighter features 
of the picture. The plain statement of facts 
on both sides warrants, we think, the conclu- 
sion that his most disastrous reverses were due 
to causes which he could not have been ex- 
pected to foresee or control ; and this view is 



326

[May 16, 



further supported by the readiness of well 
informed investors to trust his judgment again 
after disaster had befallen. The losses by the 
way were after all quite insignificant when 
compared with the accumulated wealth which 
owes its origin to the mighty stimulus that he 
gave to the material development of the States 
of the Northwest. When wealth and power 
came within his control they were employed 
with a due regard for the general welfare. As 
an indication of his attitude in this respect we 
may cite the fact that upon the completion of 
the railroad system of the Oregon Railway and 
Navigation Company, completely under his con- 
trol, the cost of moving grain to the sea was at 
once reduced by more than forty per cent, 
giving a rate lower than the growers them- 
selves had asked. Mr. Villard's enlightened 
insight recognized the importance of intellec- 
tual as well as material foundations for the 
section of the country in which he was so 
vitally interested, and when the Universities 
of Oregon and Washington were found to be 
dangerously embarrassed he came promptly to 
their relief. He paid the floating debt of the 
former, provided it with the nucleus of a 
library, and later gave it $50,000 in cash on 
condition that the legislature should levy a 
reasonable tax for its current expenses. He 
kept the University of Washington in opera- 
tion by his benefactions for two years, when 
the Territorial legislature had failed to make 
appropriations for that purpose, and the amount 
thus advanced was never returned. 

These are only instances of a beneficence 
that found many channels, when money was 
at his command, and was always intelligently 
directed and administered without display. 
But perhaps one of Mr. Villard's best services 
to the public, though not in the direction of 
what is usually classed as philanthropy, was 
his course in acquiring the ownership of the 
New York " Evening Post " and «' The Nation." 
His own relation to American journalism had 
clearly revealed to him the sinister influences 
under which it was laboring, and he determined 
that in one quarter at least the light of a gen- 
uine editorial independence should continue to 
shine. Kealizing that his ownership of these 
papers must become known, and that they 
would naturally rest under suspicion of being 
used as his personal organs in the promotion 
of his financial interests, he placed the control 
of the property entirely out of his hands, put- 
ting it in trust for the benefit of his family 
and giving the trustees full power to maintain 



its editorial independence against any interfer- 
ence whatever. The sincerity of this abdication 
of personal control was put beyond question 
by the character of the men in charge as ed- 
itors, — Edwin L. Godkin, Carl Schurz, and 
Horace White. Mr. Villard was of course 
deeply interested in the great causes with which 
the " Evening Post " and " The Nation " were 
already identified, such as the freedom of inter- 
national commerce, the reformation of the Civil 
Service, and the adoption and maintenance of 
a sound money system, as against the evils, 
actual and threatened, which had their genesis 
in the financial stress occasioned by the Civil 
War. 

Mr. Villard was thrown into contact with 
many men of immediate or subsequent prom- 
inence, and his volumes record many interesting 
episodes of such contact. In 1858, for example, 
he and Abraham Lincoln were driven, each sep- 
arately, to a little flag station in Illinois, late at 
night, and left there alone to wait for a belated 
train. There was no station house, and they were 
obliged to take refuge from a thunder storm in 
an empty freight car, where, squatting on the 
floor in the absence of anything to sit upon, 
the President- to-be talked frankly of his polit- 
ical history and prospects. ''Mary insists that 
I am going to be Senator, and President of 
the United States too " ; and then, after a roar 
of laughter at her ambition, his lank arms 
around his knees and his whole body shaking 
with mirth, "Just think of such a sucker as 
me as President ! " Mr. Villard was then but 
a comparatively unknown newspaper corre- 
spondent, only five years from his native land. 
Thirty-two years later, when his enterprises in 
the Northwest had carried his name and fame 
into many lands, he was honored with an invi- 
tation to visit Prince Bismarck, at Friedrichs- 
ruhe. The Prince was still bitterly chafing 
over the humiliation of his enforced resigna- 
tion, and poured the story of his woes into his 
visitor's ears so freely and forcibly as to pre- 
clude repetition by a man of Mr. Villard's nice 
sense of honor. On other subjects, however, 
there was no such reason for reticence, and the 
account of Bismarck's views on various matters 
discussed is of extreme interest. 

We have said nothing of the romantic story 
of Mr. Villard's youth, his arrival in this coun- 
try without the knowledge of a word of English, 
and the frequent disappointments through 
which he struggled upward to a better adjust- 
ment to his new environment. It is a story 
of absorbing interest, and there is no space to

do it justice here. We grow restive, some- 
times, under the character of many of the 
immigrants who pour in upon us from the con- 
tinent of Europe ; but when one stops to think 
that a Carl Schurz and a Henry Villard have 
come to us in that way, the immigration prob- 
lem as a whole takes on a very different aspect.

The Japanese at Close Range.* 



Not as a tourist detailing the superficial im- 
pressions gained from outside observation, but 
as a student of the language, the life, and the 
history of Japan, Dr. Scherer writes of the 
Island Empire with fresh spirit, keen insight, 
and clear outlook. He lived in southern Japan 
five years ; then, his health failing, he recuper- 
ated in the northern island of Yezo, where live 
the aboriginal Ainos. Hence he speaks with 
authority, with truth, and with sympathy, of 
the country " shaped like the rising moon, and 
named for the Rising Sun." This little bow- 
shaped line of islands bends as far as it can 
toward the West, and contains as many mil- 
lions of people as it has years of modern his- 
tory. It was only in 1854 that Commodore 
Perry " opened it, a veritable box of curios 
for the Western world." While Occidental 
curiosity regarding the contents of this box 
has seemed insatiable, the desire of this race 
of archers to turn their iron-pointed reeds into 
leaden bullets and to exchange their clumsy 
ballistics for twelve-inch steel guns has been 
insatiable too. Ten years ago Western curi- 
osity deepened into wonder when "this little 
bow-shaped country suddenly pierced the rusty 
mail of China with the swift arrow of war." 
To-day wonder has turned to amazement in 
beholding, as in a colossal game of ju-jutsu 
(^not ju-jitsu), the little islanders closing in a 
death struggle with the Slav. 

To explain Japan's rapid development from 
a curio-box to a world-power, the author pro- 
poses the word education, which predicates 
two things, — advantages and abilities. The 
Japanese have availed and will avail them- 
selves of culture just so far as they have 
capacity. Considered simply as students. Dr. 
Scherer thinks they are ideal, unparalleled 
for quick receptiveness and thorough assimila- 
tion of mental food. But he does not believe 
that they are an originative race, and he de-

trated. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



votes a chapter to proving, and (if history 
gives any certain light on the question) of 
demonstrating, that they are not originative. 

Dr. Scherer has no very high opinion of the 
morality of the Japanese, even though out- 
wardly everything in the land is lovely and 
aesthetic. He notes a difference between polite- 
ness and courtesy ; pointing out that although 
the Westerner may be outwardly clumsy and 
may never hope to equal the finesse of the 
Japanese, yet in real courtesy he is vastly the 
superior of the two. The language of Nippon 
is saturated with insincerity ; it is a superb 
instrument in helping you to say beautifully 
what you dori*t feel, while it renders less 
help in telling the truth than those languages 
that are built on lateral breadth rather than 
on perpendiculars and many grades of subor- 
dination. The Japanese are aesthetical, the 
Chinese are ethical ; the latter being creators 
and the former imitators. The upper classes 
in Japan are usually rationalists to the core, 
but as a matter of course they believe in de- 
moniacal possession. 

In summing up the Japanese traits. Dr. 
Scherer finds, on the negative side, a marked 
absence of certain attributes that to the Occi- 
dental seem fundamental and indeed inevitable 
in a civilized and enlightened nation. Moral- 
ity, as we understand the word, scarcely exists 
among the islanders. They do not know the 
value of time, they seem to have no nerves, 
they are colossally impassive and strangely 
lacking both in sympathy and in mutual con- 
fidence. In economy, politeness, industry, 
power to adopt and adapt, they are wonderful. 
So far from believing in the Cinderella theory 
of the rise of modern Japan to greatness. Dr. 
Scherer throws overboard the fairy tales of 
the tourist. He devotes a chapter to Verbeck, 
the engineer, scholar, and missionary, who, 
after all his wonderful gifts and graces are 
catalogued, was only the pioneer of an army 
of thousands of teachers, engineers, advisers, 
drill-masters, miners, and experts in every line 
of human endeavor and achievement, who for 
over a generation have taught the Japanese 
how to do the things they are doing so well 
to-day. In his opening pages Dr. Scherer 
shows the comparative resources of Japan and 
Russia on sea and land ; while in the final 
chapter, called "The Gates of Asia," he states 
his reasons for believing in the potency of the 
Japanese to win, uttering his faith in their 
victory as that of " the West in the East."

Philosophy and liiFK.* 

Perhaps the most promising sign in the realm of 
philosophy just at present is the growing conviction 
among philosophers that thinking is bound to justify 
itself by its fruits, by the contribution it makes to 
the concrete value of life. There was a time when 
the philosopher might hug himself in his isolation, 
dismiss the question of utility and practical con- 
sequences with a few condescending words, and, 
with *• thinking for thinking's sake " as his motto, 
busy himself with his abstract and esoteric doc- 
trines, under the delusion that he alone was getting 
close to reality, and that the rest of the world were 
blindly missing all the real worth of life. The 
attitude is still by no means unknown, and not a 
few thinkers of to-day seem to prize their results 
more highly the more they are out of relation 
to concrete human interests, and the more they 
emphasize the essential unreality and illusiveness of 
our knowledge. But as we come to a better knowl- 
edge of the nature of man and of the human mind, 
the less plausible does this separation appear be- 
tween valuable thinking of any kind, and practical 
aims. There is in the general temper of the times 
that which makes men turn with increasing im- 
patience from whatever meets no obvious human 
need. Psychology in particular has emphasized 
the solidarity of experience, the essentially teleologi- 
cal character of all our thinking, and its connection 
with the concrete ends of action. Ethics and re- 
ligion have long been ready to meet this tendency 
half way, and to find the possibility of spiritual 
value, not apart from the common and the practi- 
cal, in a special realm of experience, or in another 
and a higher world, but in the transformation of 
every-day experience by its relation to worthy ends. 
The same humanistic movement is showing itself 
at last in philosophy also, and is resulting in a most 
promising activity in many quarters. Professor 
William James is in America the great apostle of 
the new tendency, and there is a growing recogni- 
tion on all sides of the immense debt that contem- 
porary philosophy is beginning to owe to him. 

Three recent books illustrate in a significant way 
this new movement. Chicago and Oxford, the 
youngest and the oldest — very nearly — of the 
great English-speaking Universities, are just now 
the centres of tendencies which, though of course 
not identical, have a good deal in common. The 
" Studies in Logical Theory," which appear among 
the Decennial Publications of the University of 
Chicago, are from th e hands of Professor John

Dewey and seven colleagues, all former students 
in the Department of Philosophy; and there is 
a substantial agreement in regard to general doc- 
trine. The Studies are in form somewhat tech- 
nical and closely reasoned, and are not easily 
intelligible to the general reader. But for the 
student of modern Logic, their importance is 
very considerable, involving as they do a recon- 
struction in large measure of logical theory. The 
main thesis of the book is in the direction of what 
the writers call the instrumental character of Logic. 
It insists upon the essentially practical nature of 
the logical problem. Truth does not refer to a 
sphere of reality outside human experience, which 
thought is content to stand off and copy. It rather 
represents a means to the enriching and harmo- 
nizing of experience itself. We cannot understand 
thought save as we recognize that it is not merely 
thought in general, but that it grows out of particu- 
lar crises of experience, particular psychological 
situations, and has for its purpose to reconcile the 
contradictions of life, and lead the way to a new 
and larger immediacy of satisfaction. The things 
which it knows, the laws which it uses, are all rela- 
tive to their teleological and practical value, not 
metaphysical things in themselves. And so the 
test of valid thinking is not a mere supposed cor- 
respondence with reality, but the practical test of 
success in leading to fulness of life. This general 
thesis is defended with much acuteness, and with a 
great deal of psychological insight, against various 
modern types of theory. Of course it raises many 
questions, not all of which the writers succeed in 
answering plausibly ; and it will not improbably be 
felt by many to be one-sided in its emphasis, and 
to make the riddles of existence rather simpler than 
the facts warrant. But that it is an important piece 
of work, whose general influence will be salutary 
in the direction of making philosophy more con- 
cretely human, cannot be doubted. 

Mr. Schiller's volume of essays entitled " Hu- 
manism " continues the line of attack which was 
started by a group of Oxford men in the recently 
published "Personal Idealism." It will make a 
more popular appeal than the work just noticed ; 
indeed, it is as distinctly popular in form as a seri- 
ous piece of philosophical writing that deals with 
more or less technical subjects can easily be. Mr. 
Schiller has a good colloquial English style, and 
heartily despises the uncouth phraseology in terms 
of which it has come to be felt necessary to treat 
philosophical subjects. He has, moreover, a sense 
of humor not common among philosophers, which 
shows a tendency to pass into sarcasm whenever he 
happens to think of his particular aversions — Mr. 
Bradley and the Absolutists. To this is to be added 
a distinct originality of treatment, which opens up 
many things in a suggestive way, and which is not 
held in check by an undue fear of inconsistency. 
If the tone also shows a self-confidence which occa- 
sionally approaches audacity (one might instance

as lecturing Plato and Aristotle in the realms of the 
Blest), this quality adds zest to the reading. And, 
finally, the author is not ashamed to connect phil- 
osophy with real human interests. This is indeed 
the burden of the volume as a whole. The h priori 
philosophies have all been found out, as the preface 
puts it. The only useful method in philosophy in- 
volves the recognition that our beliefs are all postu- 
lates, set up to satisfy human needs, and accepted 
on the basis of their success in meeting these needs, 
— a new empiricism, in which the emotional side of 
man's nature is made, however, equally important 
with the physical or the merely intellectual. " The 
Ethical Basis of Metaphysical Truth," <' Non- 
Euclidian Geometry," "Reality and Idealism," 
"Darwinism and Design," "The Place of Pes- 
simism in Philosophy," "Concerning Mephisto- 
pheles," "The Desire for Immortality," — this 
selection of chapter-headings will suggest the cath- 
olic range of interests which the essays cover. 

Turning to another volume which also, though 
in a very different way, emphasizes the practical 
value of thought for life, one's estimate is apt to 
vary considerably according to the standpoint from 
which he views it. " The Nature of Man " is pro- 
fessedly a scientific study of old age and death. 
That science, and science alone, is our source of 
refuge in time of trouble, appears to the author 
an elementary truth. Man is a mere animal of a 
superior sort who can think, in a world where nat- 
ural law reigns supreme ; and his happiness lies in 
having an organism as completely as possible ad- 
justed to his surroundings, — which at present it 
is far from being. Of these mal-adjustments, the 
chief place is assigned to those that centre about 
old age and death. Religion and philosophy are 
brushed lightly aside as having no message of 
relief ; what is the answer of science ? The main 
outcome of the book is to the effect that the ills 
that attach to old age are perfectly preventible. 
The phenomena of old age are largely due to the 
encroachment of the white corpuscles on the higher 
tissues of the body ; and this probably could be 
prevented by introducing a serum to strengthen 
such tissues, and by taking other means at the 
same time to prevent the growth of the bacteria 
of putrefaction. Old age would then be a per- 
fectly natural (now it is pathological) ripening of 
powers, with duties and a satisfaction of its own 
that would be necessary for a complete experience ; 
and it would pass at length without perturbation into 
a — perhaps somewhat easily assumed — " instinct 
for death." And since life would no longer be cut 
off prematurely, but only when the desire for life had 
ceased, the fear of death that now torments man- 
kind would be lost. The writer's eminent qualifica- 
tions make the scientific part of his book of great 
interest ; it points in the direction of results which, 
if they are attained, will be without doubt of the 
utmost practical importance and benefit. As a com- 
plete philosophy, however, and a professed answer 
to all the tangled problems of human life, it offers 



what to many readers will seem a rather slender 
programme. The writer's temper of mind is cast a 
little too much in the mould of scientific dogmatism, 
and is too lacking in a broad sympathy for man's 
many-sided nature, to be a wholly safe guide to the 
highest philosophy of living. ^ j^ Rogebs.

18 a fittmg opportunity for the addi- 
tion of Jeremy Taylor to the list. No important 
biography of the famous Royalist divine has ap- 
peared since Eden's revision (published in 1854) 
of Reginald Heber's " Life," prefixed to his edition 
of Taylor's works (1822). The latest biographer, 
Mr. Edmund Gosse, apparently profiting by the 
tender admonitions of his critics, has made an 
earnest effort to keep his pages free from mis- 
statements of fact ; and we have observed no errors 
that are of sufficient importance to affect his gen- 
eral conclusions. The article in the " Dictionary 
of National Biography " (Iv. 422-429) is not by 
the Rev. T. B. Johnstone (p. viii.), but by the Rev. 
Alexander Gordon. Taylor was nominated Fellow 
of All Souls, Oxford, on November 6 (not 3), 
1635. The "pearls and rubies" from the ebony 
case of the King's Bible (p. 63) are identified by 
Mr. Roberts with the two diamonds and ruby set 
in a ring bearing the date of 1649 (cp. D. N. B., 
Iv. 423). Evelyn first heard Taylor on April (not 
March) 15, 1654 (p. 109). Taylor was conse- 
crated on January 27 (not 18), 1661 (p. 175). To 
offset these minor lapses, it may be said that Mr. 
Gosse rejects in toto the evidence furnished by 
Lady Wray's letter of 1732, which, whether writ- 
ten in good or in bad faith, is certainly most un- 
trustworthy, and has misled to some extent almost 
every biographer of Taylor down to the present 
time. Some parts of the life of Taylor are in- 
volved in obscurity : his college life, his four 
years at Uppingham, his whereabouts at times 
during the Civil War and the Commonwealth pe- 
riod. Mr. Gosse indulges in few conjectures, and 
some of his guesses are perhaps as near the truth 
as one may now hope to get. His assumption that 
Taylor beheld the entry of Charles I. into Oxford 
in October, 1641, is borne out by the fact that 
Taylor was admitted D.D. of Brasenose College on 
November 1. In its larger aspects, Mr. Gosse's 
biography must be pronounced of good proportion, 
sympathetic, and in criticism fairly adequate and 
just. He is right in emphasiziUg Taylor's impor- 
tance as a writer rather than as a theologian or a 
casuist. While admitting the theological and philo- 
sophical importance of " The Liberty of Prophesy- 
ing," he points out its literary inferiority. " Holy 
Dying " is immensely superior to " Holy Living," 
being not a piece of task-work but rather " a pro-

duct of vehement inspiration." Taylor's authorship 
of the '' Discourse of Auxiliary Beauty " is re- 
jected ; but Mr. Gosse decides that Taylor must 
have written the title and taken charge of the MS. 
for <' some great lady in the orthodox camp," per- 
haps the Countess of Devonshire. The chapter 
on "Taylor's Place in Literary History" is an 
acute and comprehensive study of the various 
aspects of the art of " the Shakespeare of English 
prose." The volume will add to the reputation of 
its author as an accomplished critic and biographer.

commercial distinctly the bistory of the growth 

aristocracy. of the Commercial aristocracy which 

governed the state during the entire period of its 
active corporate life. When every other nation 
was gradually developing a tendency toward popu- 
lar government, Venice had reversed the order. 
Beginning with a scheme on which, whatever its 
feudal resemblances, there prevailed the first prin- 
ciple of democracy, majority rule, the change was 
from equality to privilege, from popular rule to that 
most absolute of all governments, an oligarchy. In 
his " Oligarchy of Venice " (Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co.), Mr. George B. McClellan traces this evolu- 
tion, from its beginnings in the days of the migra- 
tion of the peoples to the end of the story. There 
is no attempt to include anything of the literary or 
artistic history of Venice: no painter or poet is 
even mentioned ; the book is a study of what Mr. 
McClellan aptly calls "the Venetian leit-motif," 
the supremacy of its commerce and its merchants. 
When refugees from the mainland first sought pro- 
tection from the Huns in the shallows and the 
lagoons, they brought with them certain traditions 
which were strong enough to influence, but not 
strong enough to found, a government; but they 
also brought " an almost absolute equality of pov- 
erty," and it was this fact that led directly to class 
cleavage along the lines of material success in the 
days that followed. Add to this the peculiar geo- 
graphical conditions under which Venice existed, 
and the basis of her history is complete. The story 
of the first acquisition of power by the doges as 
representatives of the people, and the gradual limi- 
tation of the power of both doge and people through 
successive coups d'etat, is well told by Mr. McClel- 
lan, whose work shows a thorough study of all the 
materials at hand, as well as judgment in the selec- 
tion of authorities in the cases where notable preju- 
dice, as against the church or the ruling aristocracy, 
might have influenced the writer. This judgment 
is especially evidenced in the treatment of that most 
discussed event in Venetian history, the conspiracy 
of the Doge Marino Falier. Mr. McClellan takes 
the position, easily justified by a study of Marino 
Falier's character, but generally opposed by histo- 
rians, that something more than a mere childish spite 
was the basis of the Doge's action. " It is more 
than likely that through the long years of his pub- 
lic activity he had chafed under the oppression of 



those whom he regarded as his inferiors, and only 
awaited an opportunity of endeavoring to break 
their power. It does not necessarily follow that 
Falier was in advance of his time in a fondness for 
popular liberty. It is, however, altogether probable 
that bis hatred of the oligarchy was the growth of 
years and not of a day, and that in scheming to 
destroy it he would naturally turn to the then only 
known remedy for the oppression of the nobles, — 
a benevolent despotism founded upon the support 
of the people." Mr. McClellan's recent election to 
the mayoralty of New York has led to an attempt 
to refer his treatment of certain phases of Venetian 
political life to modern problems. It is only just 
to say that he is entirely free from such evidences 
of a lack of taste. Venetian imperialism, class 
politics, and political machines are treated solely 
in reference to the conditions peculiar to Venice, 
and lose none of their interest thereby. 

When a man does a great many 
^irTrSt^*. things well,- almost as well as the 

best, but not quite, — he is apt to 
find his work overshadowed to a large extent by 
the work of those who stand just above and beyond 
him. The Right Honorable Lord Avebury affords 
a striking instance of this. He is one of the great 
scientists of the century, — not only the friend of 
Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley, and Spencer, but their 
active co-worker, fighting with them the great bat- 
tles which the friends of science have waged in the 
last half-century ; he is an authority in many impor- 
tant biological, geological, and botanical matters; 
he has led not only the thought and the writing of 
his time, but in many cases its legislation as well, 
wherever questions of practical reform have arisen. 
Yet it is probably safe to say that hardly one person 
in a thousand knows him except as the Sir John 
Lubbock who has told us so well and so truly about 
" The Pleasures of Life " and " The Use of Life." 
This is especially true in America, where his par- 
liamentary services are unknown, and where there 
naturally is but little interest in his progressive 
attitude toward education, economics, and religion, 
as evidenced by his position in the political life of 
England. Some idea of the variety and depths of 
his interests may be gained from a recently pub- 
lished volume of his occasional " Essays and Ad- 
dresses" (Macmillan), in which the subjects range 
from Municipal Trading, the Fiscal Policy of 
England, and the present position of British Com- 
merce, to Huxley, Ruskin, Bank-holidays, and 
Nature-study. The introductory essay, on " Hux- 
ley's Life and Work," is especially valuable for its 
searching analysis of Huxley's attitude toward re- 
ligion, — not toward creeds, dogmas, and miracles, 
but toward the religion which implies " the strenu- 
ous endeavor to be and do what is right," as well 
as a reverence for " whatsoever things are true, 
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are 
just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things 
are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report."

The old discussion of the conflict between science 
and religion is no longer carried on with any seri- 
ousness, outside of high-school debating clubs ; but 
one of the evil effects of that so-called conflict has 
lasted far beyond its time, namely, the belief that 
Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, Spencer, and their co- 
workers in modern scientific research, were what 
they were called at the time when their theories 
first startled the world, — materialists, atheists, 
unchristian men. Calling them such, and believing 
them such, has become a habit, a habit that the 
careful study of their works, or, failing that, the 
careful reading of an essay like Lord Avebury's, 
should do much to break. There is something 
noble and inspiring in the picture of this old man, 
remaining after the work of all his friends is done, 
to vindicate their good name. And he does it 

worthily. 

The writing of reminiscences still

Callcott Horsley, R.A., who died last 
October at the age of eighty-seven, contributes his 
"Recollections of a Royal Academician" (Dutton), 
edited by Mrs. Edmund Helps. From the fact 
that he was a schoolfellow of Shelley's, that his 
vocation brought him into the friendliest relations 
with the Queen and the Prince Consort, and that 
his long connection with the Royal Academy made 
him acquainted with a host of noted men, both in 
his own and in other callings, we are prepared to 
expect some chapters of interest from his pen — 
or, rather, from that of his amanuensis, to whom 
he dictated from a well-stored and remarkably 
retentive memory. Nor are we disappointed. 
These artless reminiscences have something of 
that charm of professional enthusiasm and ingenu- 
ous self-revelation that made Haydon's Autobiog- 
raphy so attractive to readers of fifty years ago ; 
and they have not a particle of that sourness of 
disappointed ambition which rendered Haydon's 
book not exactly a gospel of sweetness and light. 
In his painting, Horsley sometimes, as Haydon 
almost always, chose themes from history, sacred 
or profane. Like Haydon, too, he was a devoutly 
religious man, as his book shows in a not too ob- 
trusive way. But as his was a far healthier nature 
than the poor suicide's, his reminiscences are by so 
much the pleasanter reading. An aptitude for 
other forms of art besides his chosen one enlarged 
Horsley's sympathies, so that we find him on inti- 
mate terms with Mendelssohn, Moscheles, the 
Kembles, and others famous in the musical, dra- 
matic, or literary world. Profound, even to excess, 
was his admiration for Queen Victoria, for the 
artist Turner, and for Sir Walter Scott. No 
superlatives are too strong to denote their unap- 
proachable excellence. Latter-day critics do not 
rate Horsley nearly so high as his frankly com- 
placent reminiscences might lead one to infer. 
He outlived the somewhat undue fame of his 
palmiest days ; but he evidently remained to the 
end a very agreeable raconteur. 



A popular account ^o the general reader of history, 
of Norman-Bngiith the later ccnturies of the Middle 
national life. ^ggg^ _ t^e period of Feudalism, — 

is likely to appear as an age of endless turmoil and 
confusion. Seeing the interminable feuds of quar- 
relsome lords and militant bishops, he naturally 
infers that life in those days must have been rude 
and unsettled. As to its rudeness, there can be no 
question ; but rarely has an age seen conditions 
more firmly settled and fixed. The further we pen- 
etrate into the lower strata of feudal civilization, 
the more pronounced do we find this fixity of con- 
ditions and the greater the monotony of life. This 
fact is well brought out in a recent volume entitled 
"Mediseval England," by Miss Mary Bateson^ 
Lecturer of Newnham College, Cambridge. The 
book is an account of English society from the 
Norman Conquest to 1350, and belongs to <^ The 
Story of the Nations" series (Putnam). It would 
seem that such a work does not exactly fit into the 
scheme of that series : there is nothing picturesque 
in the daily drudgery of the serf, nothing dramatic 
in the life-history of the average clerk or monk. 
Though the book is therefore not of the kind that 
we should expect, it is none the less valuable, as it 
is perhaps the first serious effort to write a popular 
account of Norman-English society. The author 
aims to present a full view of the national life as it 
was lived in country and in town, at court and in 
castle, in spacious monasteries and on wide manors. 
Political movements are kept in the background, 
and important personages are noticed only when 
their recorded mode of living may serve to illus- 
trate some particular phase of social existence. The 
author shows great familiarity with the literature of 
the period and subjects treated, and puts before us 
a mass of historic details, nearly all of which make 
excellent materials, though some might more prop- 
erly have been omitted. It may be added that 
the author seems to underestimate the Anglo-Saxon 
civilization that preceded William's invasion, and 
credits the Normans with making a great many 
improvements that probably date from the period 
before 1066. The book is written in a rather heavy 
style, and the author's meaning is not always readily 
apparent; but on the whole she has succeeded in pro- 
ducing a readable and scholarly work. 



Eiiays and 
plays by an 
Irish mystic. 



That Mr. William Butler Yeats 
should have won his way to so 
large a place in the public eye be- 
speaks marked talent. A pronounced mystic, a 
seer of visions, and dreamer of dreams, he stands 
at the opposite pole from the comfortable Anglo- 
Saxon burgher and his leisure-consuming wife, who 
are actuated by nothing if not plain common sense 
and a respect for the conventionalities. Mr. Yeats 
is a man of temperament, and it is the boast of 
most of the English-speaking race that they are 
without that somewhat discommoding possession to 
any noticeable extent. And yet he continues to 
write, which means that he is read. In his '^ Ideas

of Good and Evil" (published, like the other books 
to be mentioned, by the Macmillan Co.) he sets 
forth the faith that is in him, in the form of medi- 
SBval white magic, crystal reading, interpretation 
of dreams and the like, mingling these things with 
disquisitions on literature, but always from the same 
mystical and semi-comprehensible point of view. 
This book has been followed by two volumes of 
<' Flays for an Irish Theatre," the first containing a 
five-act satirical tragedy, "Where There is Nothing," 
in which the customary person of " respectability " 
is held up to shrewd scorn, while the protagonist 
goes from an assured position in the county to the 
road as a tinker, falls ill through unwonted expos- 
ure to the elements, becomes a monk, preaches 
what may be termed sentimental nihilism, is ex- 
pelled from the convent, takes refuge with his 
scanty following in the Irish hills, and there is 
slain by a bigoted peasantry. The other book 
contains three one-act plays, the first of which, 
" The Hour Glass," portrays the death of a teacher 
whose powers of intellect have led him into a fatal 
denial of things unseen. The second play, '< Gath- 
leen Ni Hoolihan," is a beautiful bit of symbolic 
patriotism, the title being that given the green land 
of Erin itself when British tyranny denied its peo- 
ple the use of the very name of their country. The 
last of the three dramas, " A Pot of Broth," is 
picaresque, being the tale of a wandering rascal 
who sells a magic stone to a " near " peasant 
woman. All are practicable plays, not merely 
"literary," and were written for the theatrical 
venture in Dublin which the playwright and his 
friends have made so artistically successful. 

A book about ^' ^^ made apparent in the collection 

bu^inest education of essays entitled "Business Edu- 
and accountancy. ^^^^^^ ^nd Accountancy " ( Harper), 
edited by Dr. Frederick A. Cleveland from the 
writings of the late Charles Waldo Haskins, that 
the trend of education to-day is toward the same 
system that prevailed in Mesopotamia from the 
beginnings of history. From Mr. Haskins's schol- 
arly and interesting paper on " Accountancy in 
Babylonia and Assyria " it is evident that, while 
the problems in arithmetic given as exercises for 
the infant Babylonian mind were of the mercantile 
type so familiar to American children, the ancient 
instructor went much further and used forms of 
contracts and commercial documents for reading 
and writing lessons, and, further, that the higher 
education was largely along the lines of modern com- 
mercial schools. This is something worth knowing, 
if only to settle the question whether we are four 
thousand years behind our times or the ancient 
Babylonians were four thousand years ahead of 
theirs. With the increase in the magnitude of 
commercial affairs in recent years there has come 
a demand for improved methods of the keeping of 
trust and corporation accounts. Mr. Haskins was 
one of the first to see and supply that demand, and 
he sought always to raise what had theretofore been

the merest clerical position to the dignity of a pro- 
fession, with all the emoluments thereunto belong- 
ing. In this, and in obtaining legal recognition of 
such a profession as that of " certified public ac- 
countant," he was successful. As the organizer of 
the federal system of account-keeping Mr. Haskins 
obtained a national reputation, enhanced by his 
appointment to the position of Dean of the New 
York University School of Commerce, Accounts, 
and Finance. These facts are set forth by Dr. 
Cleveland in a memoir of the author, whose grasp 
of his subject as shown in the papers making up the 
volume in hand prove him to have been no small 
factor in the recent commercial development of the 
United States. 

The aim of Mr. B. M. Johnston's 
" Napoleon : A Short Biography " 
(Barnes), as stated in the author's 
preface, is to " furnish a correct outline of Napo- 
leonic history and to point the way along which it 
may be profitably pursued." Unhappily this aim 
has not been carried out. The student who should 
take this work as a guide would fail to discover in 
Napoleon anything more than a military adven- 
turer. The civil side of his work, except the Code 
and the Concordat, is almost wholly ignored. 
There are barely half a dozen lines on his Italian 
policy, and not much more upon his work in Ger- 
many. Nearly all the author's space is taken by 
narratives of the successive military campaigns. 
And what is told is marred by serious inaccuracies. 
For example, in the account of the 13th Vendd- 
miare it is remarked that Barras was a member of 
the " Directoire " and that this was then the exec- 
utive of France, although in fact the Directory was 
chosen nearly a month later. Barras is also de- 
scribed as a civilian. In a chapter further on, 
Savary is mentioned as the leader of the expedi- 
tion to Ettenheim which effected the seizure of the 
Due d' Enghien, and the date of the execution at 
Vincennes is incorrectly given. Still later the 
Bourbons are said to have been proclaimed by the 
Provisional Government in 1814 before Napoleon 
had abdicated, and it is added that Louis XVIII. 
entered Paris while the negotiations with Napoleon 
were in progress. These illustrations are sufficient. 
Such a lack of care in explaining well-known events 
is all the more strange because the bibliographical 

lists are good. 

Mr. Alexander Innes Shand, who is 
a veteran newspaper correspondent, 
author of biographies, books of tra- 
vel, and a book descriptive of hunting and fishing, 
and who is a persistent " knockabout " and bon 
vivant as well, has written in "Old-Time Travel" 
(Pott) his " personal reminiscences of the Continent 
forty years ago compared with experiences of the 
present day." The portion of Europe with which 
the author began to familiarize himself two-score 
years ago comprised all excepting Russia and the 
Balkan and Scandinavian peninsulas ; and his de-

scriptions of what was and is to be seen in the 
countries west of the Rhine, although sometimes a 
little rhapsodical, are yet informing and delightful. 
The changes which he notes as having been wrought 
during the years of his European travel are not so 
much in the appearance of the cities and towns as 
in the modes of travel, in the fare at the various 
hostelries, in the sports to be engaged in, and in the 
social life to be enjoyed. All this is from the stand- 
point of the author of " Half a Century, or Changes 
in Men and Manners." Whether the forty illus- 
trations, from water-colors by Mr. A. H. Hallam 
Murray, were made for the book or the book for 
the illustrations, or whether they came indepen- 
dently into existence and were subsequently found 
to have a mutual affinity, might remain open ques- 
tions so far as internal evidence goes. But, at all 
events, both author and artist have contributed to 
the making of a charming book. 

A New England ^he fact that a biography need not 
woman of a celebrate a famous name in order to 

isentury ago. ^ye interesting is well proved by the 

" Memorials of Mary Wilder White," edited by her 
daughter, and issued from the Everett Press, Bos- 
ton. This volume is made up largely of Mrs. 
White's letters, and is valuable for showing very 
frankly and sincerely the character and thoughts 
of a New England woman a hundred years ago, — 
a woman who, though of decidedly more than av- 
erage cultivation, belonged to no famous coterie. 
Her life was not without its excitements, for at sev- 
enteen she was married to a West Indian planter 
who took her to Guadeloupe at a time when insur- 
rections were of almost daily occurrence, and yellow 
fever raged with little check. In five months she 
lost both her husband and her only brother, and 
her own life >f as repeatedly threatened. But after 
her return to Concord her life was only ordinarily 
eventful, and her biography owes its chief charm 
to the revelation of her personality in her letters, 
many of which are given here. They reveal a rare 
delicacy of thought, with force and grace of char- 
acter. Nowhere are these qualities more delight- 
fully shown than in her love-letters to Mr. Daniel 
Appleton White, to whom she was married in 1807. 
In their restraint and dignity, these letters might 
well serve as a model to the present more exu- 
berant age. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We doubt if the most hardened of apologists for our 
national policy in the Philippine Islands could read 
without searchings of heart " The Story of the Lopez

comments, and edited for publication in book form by 
Mr. Canning Eyot. These letters give us an insight 
into Filipino life and character such as we may seek in 
vain in the books of travellers or in official documents. 
The fact that they were written without any notion of 
publication makes their revelations all the more poig- 
nantly effective, and they constitute probably the most 



valuable of all the human documents that have re- 
sulted from our unhappy venture in colonialism. The

strictly textual matter, there is an elaborate critical 
essay by way of introduction, while with each story 
selected there goes a rather long list of other stories 
of the same period, which provides ample material for 
a further study of the subject. The book as a whole 
exhibits good judgment, and will be found useful for 
educational purposes.

as manifested in the natural and moral world." The 
treatment of the subject is as untechnical as possible, 
considering the recondite nature of the investigations 
discussed, and provides a statement of the present con- 
dition of physical theory concerning the ultimate nature 
of matter and force. 

Mr. W. T. Ashley's work entitled " The Adjustment 
of Wages " (Longmans) is a study of conditions in the 
coal and iron industries of Great Britain and America. 
The material consists of eight lectures delivered by the 
author at Oxford in 1903, with the addition of a num- 
ber of illustrative documents. The attempt is to give 
a general survey of existing conditions, rather than to 
solve the problem of industrial organization. The con- 
clusion is reached that ** the differences between the 
United States and Great Britain, in the matter of the 
organization of labor, are differences of degree, not of 
kind," — the latter country having reached a later stage 
of industrial development. Mr. Ashley's presentation 
of the problem can hardly fail to interest the average 
reader, and will induce him, incidentally, to draw some 
conclusions of his own. 

Herr L, Viereck's " Zwei Jahrhunderte Deutschen 
Unterrichts in denVereinigten Staaten" (Braunschweig- 
Vieweg — New York: Stechert) is the expansion of a 
paper on " German Instruction in American Schools " 
prepared by the author several years ago for the Re- 
port of the U. S. Commissioner of Education. In its 
present form the work is a volume of three hundred 
pages, presenting not only a conspectus of modern con- 
ditions and courses in the various school systems and 
universities (together with portraits of many well- 
known teachers of German), but also a historical sur- 
vey of the subject based upon a very wide range of 
authorities. The book is even more than this, for it is 
a study of the influence of German culture upon Amer- 
ican life and thought, viewed in a far wider than the 
merely educational aspect. There are some amusing 
misprints of proper names, of which the most conspicu- 
ous is that of William Torvey (for Torrey) Harris, on 
the frontispiece portrait, and the most startling that of 
Dr. " Morderow " Wilson for the president of Princeton 
University.

Sons. 

"The Spanish Colonial System," by William Roscher, 
is a translation of a chapter of the " Kolonialpolitik " of 
that author, made for American students by Professor 
Edward G. Bourne, and published as a pamphlet by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

The Messrs. Putnam have issued a new and cheaper 
edition of Mr. George Gary Eggleston's estimates of 
those " American Immortals " whose names find place 
in the New York University's Hall of Fame. The 
volume is a handsome one externally, and is liberally 
supplied with portraits in photogravure. 

Two additions to the " American Commonwealths " 
series have just been announced. A volume on Massa- 
chusetts will be supplied by Prof. Edward Channing of 
Harvard, and one on Rhode Island by Mr. Irving B. 
Richman, author of a recently-published work entitled 
" Rhode Island : Its Making and its Meaning." 

A volume on G. F. Watts, by Mr. G. K. Chesterton, 
appears in " The Popular Library of Art," published 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. It is a pretty little 
book, abundantly illustrated. The same publishers also 
send us, in their "Little Biographies," a volume on 
Robert Burns, by Mr. T. F. Henderson, also having 
numerous illustrations. 



Mr. Henry Frowde publishes for the Oxford Clar- 
endon Press an edition of More's " Utopia," provided 
with introduction, notes, and a glossarial index by Mr.

torial thoroughness and scholarship. 

"Social Progress" for 1904, published by the Baker

An English translation of " The Annals of Tacitus,'*

and provided with introduction, notes, and maps, forms 
a handsome volume of more than four hundred pages, 
of which the American edition bears the imprint of 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

It is intended to apply whatever profits are derived 
from the sale of Mr. Samuel T. Pickard's new literary 
guide, " Whittier Land," to the preservation and care 
of the Whittier houses at Haverhill and Amesbury 
which are to be kept open always for such visitors as 
love the memory of Whittier. 

A selection of "Poems That Every Child Should 
Know," made by Miss Mary E. Burt, is published by 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. Miss Burt's large 
experience in teaching literature to children, as well as 
in making books for them to read, gives this volume a 
value far beyond most of its kind. 

By special arrangement Messrs. Harper & Brothers 
have acquired the rights to Mr. Irving Bacheller's 
three novels, « Eben Holden," "D'ri and I," and

amount of before inaccessible poetry that it brings 
within reach. 

Messrs. A. W. Elson & Co. are the publishers of a 
series of thirty photogravures illustrative of " Renais- 
sance Painting in Italy." With these reproductions, 
which come in three portfolios of ten plates each, there

graphs issued by the same house. This catalogue is 
illustrated, and the descriptive list is furnished by 
Prof. John C. Van Dyke.

The Macmillan Co. send us an edition of the 
" Leviathan " of Hobbes, published as a " Cambridge 
English Classic " under the editorship of Mr. A, R. 
Waller. The reprint is from the first issue of 1651, 
with the original spelling and punctuation preserved. 
There is a facsimile of the title-page. 

A new novel by Mr. Thomas Dixon is announced by 
Messrs Doubleday, Page & Co. " The Clansman " is 
its title, and it has to do with the Ku Klux Klan move- 
ment. The same publishing firm will issue shortly 
" The Tomboy at Work " by Miss Jeannette L. Gilder, 
and " The Interloper " by Mrs. Violet Jacobs. 

A supplement to Hain and Copinger's well-known 
" Repertorium Bibliographicum " has been prepared by 
Dr. Dietrich Reichling, and will be published in parts 
by Mr. Jacques Rosenthal of Munich. The first part, 
to appear at an early date, will contain more than four 
hundred incunabula unknown to Hain and Copinger, 
together with many corrections and emendations. 

"Teutonic Legends in the Nibelungen Lied and the 
Nibelungen Ring," by Dr. W. C. Sawyer, is a recent 
publication of the J. B. Lippincott Co. The work is 
in part a translation of Dr. Wilhelm Wagner's prose 
version of the "Nibelungen Lied." An essay on 
"The Legendary in German Literature," by Dr. 
Fritz Schultze, written for this volume, serves it as a 
preface. 

As the first volume in a projected series of rare 
Americana, the A. Wessels Co. will publish this month 
a reprint of the Rev. Andrew Burnaby's "Travels 
through the Middle Settlements," being an account of 
a tour through the American colonies during the years 
just previous to the Revolution. Mr. Rufus Rockwell 
Wilson has supplied an introduction and notes to the 
new edition. 

To the list of text-books devoted to the history and 
government of the various states of the Union, Dr. 
Grace Raymond Hebard's volume on Wyoming should 
prove an attractive addition. The history of Wyoming 
is of especial interest in connection with the subject of 
national territorial expansion, and this phase has 
been given full attention in Dr. Hebard's book. The 
Whitaker & Ray Co. of San Francisco will publish the 
volume shortly. 

" A History of Matrimonial Institutions," by Pro- 
fessor George E. Howard, is announced for publication 
this month by the University of Chicago Press. The 
same publishers also announce second editions of their 
recent books, " The Code of Hammurabi," edited by 
Professor Robert f'rancis Harper; "The Psychology 
of Child Development," by Professor Irving King; 
and "Lectures on Commerce," edited by Professor 
Henry Rand Hatfield. 

Four volumes of the " Temple School Shakespeare " 
are sent us by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. They are 
"Julius Caesar," edited by Mr. F. Armytage-Morley; 
" Hamlet," edited by Mr. Oliphant Smeaton; " As You 
Like It," edited by Miss Flora Masson; and "Richard 
II.," edited by Mr. W. Keith Leask. The series is En- 
glish in its origin, being an enterprise of the Messrs. 
Dent. The volumes are usefully illustrated, and the 
notes are fairly elaborate. 

Mr. Henry Bradley's "The Making of English" 
(Macmillan) is a nice little book of popular etymology 
and general word-study, which may best be described 
as a more modern and more scholarly Trench. We are 
glad that Mr. Bradley's labors on the great Dictionary 



have spared him time for the writing of this useful and 
agreeable little volume, which will do much, in its way, 
to inculcate the elementary principles of sound English 
scholarship upon the mind of the general reader. 

The chief features of the April issue of " The Bur- 
lington Magazine " are Mr. Lionel Cust's essay on 
"H. R. H. Prince Albert as an Art Collector"; Mr. R. S. 
Clouston's article on Claydon House, Bucks, and its 
decorations and furniture; a description of Sir William 
Bennett's collection of Chinese powdered blue porce- 
lain; notes on a collection of drawings by Millet; and 
an article on the Rembrandt etchings in the Dutuit col- 
lection. These and other contributions are richly illus- 
trated. The subscription price of the magazine has 
been reduced from $10. to $8. a year.

OOOK publishers and book journals are 
^— ' alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous joui-nals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom ai*e bookish people. All 
the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preeminently a book 
jom'nal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 




' 1 'HE DIAL is more generally consulted 
'■ and depended upon by Librarians in 
making up orders for books than any 
other American critical journal; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other journal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.

BRUVVER JIM'S BABY Phillip Verrili Mighels 



A baby found on the plains and brought up in a rough mining camp, is the unique situation 
developed with humor and pathos in this tale of the West. There is much of Bret Harte's subtle 
appeal in this work, especially in picturing the Nevada gold fields and the rough miners strangely 
softened by the advent of this tiny pilgrim among them. Cloth, $1.50. 

THE LIGHT OF THE STAR Hamlin Garland 

The author of Hesper brings to this romance all the vigor of style displayed in his Western 
tales, and pictures stage life in New York to-day with the same convincing touch with which he has 
written of the plains. The glitter of the stage, the depressing realities behind the scenes, and the 
surge of life upon Broadway are drawn with a master touch. Cloth, $1.50. 

THE GIVERS Mary E. Wilkins Freeman 

A collection of stories which represent this popular author absolutely at her best. All are tales 
of the humor and pathos of New England life, the type in which the author scored her remarkable 
early successes. Cloth, $1.25. 

IN SEARCH OF THE UNKNOWN Robert W. Chambers 

A unique and diverting story of the strange adventures of a learned professor who is on the 
track of some entirely new facts with which he intends to astonish the world. In the meantime his 
assistant meets several girls and half a dozen love affairs develop. Cloth, $1.50. 

THE GATES OF CHANCE van Tassel Sutphen 

The strange adventures of two young men of Bohemian tendencies. The scene is New York 
City of the present, but the intricacies of plot and atmosphere of mystery give to the book a flavor 
of Oriental tales of enchantment. Cloth, $1.50.

A New and Very Timely Book by Dr. Woll von Schierbrand, Author of " Russia : Her Strength and 

Weakness," " Germany of To-day," etc. 

America, Asia, and the Pacific 

With special reference to the Russo-Japanese War and its results. With large maps. About 350 pp. 12mo. 
This book treats the present conflict and its probable resalts as only preliminary to larger considerations. It attempts 
to answer, more or less fully, the questions which are apt to be put by the average intelligent man regarding America's rela- 
tions to all the countries bordering on the Pacific, not only those directly concerned in the present juncture in Asia, but all 
affected by the Panama Canal, on both coasts of the Pacific and the islands. The book devotes special attention to an 
analysis of the points of strength and weakness in the equipment of our rivals in the fast approaching struggle, commercial 
and possibly political, for supremacy in the Pacific. 



THE BUILDING OF THE WEST, in Fiction 



IOWA 



Aladdin & Co. 

By Herbert Quick 



$1.50 

N. Y. Sun: " A story of business and love full of the 
American flavor. . . . We have liked the business part ; it 
has entertained us to read of the quick and mighty develop- 
ment of the city of Lattimore ; we have followed with interest 
and wonder the Napoleonic doings of Jimmie Elkins, the 
boomer. . . . But particularly, and more than for these, we 
find that we must be thankful for Josie Trescott, the heroine. 
. . . Josie is adorable. . . . An unusal and admirable 
story, if the reader is wise he will hasten him and 
get It." 

y^. Y. Time* Saturday Review : •' An unhackneyed subject, 
developed with a skill and humor . . . delightfully realistic. 
Mr. Quick is a wizard who can recognize the dramatic posbi- 
bilities. . . . For sheer excitement and breathless interest it 
would be hard to match in any very recent literature the wild 
ride through flood and storm of the special train. . . . The 
small army of minor characters have wonderfully distinct per- 
sonalities. ... A story very: much out of the ordinary 
in both matter, style, and spirit." 

Uncle Mac's Nebrasky 

By Wm. R. Lighton, author of "The Ultimate Moment." 



OHIO 



Port Argent 

By Arthur Colton, author of 

"Tioba." $1.50 

JV. Y. Timet Saturday Review : " Vivid . . . somewhat 
intense, not to say tragic, ... a good story. The author gets 
pretty close to verities ; he has an eye to see things fairly ; he 
is not blind to the humor of them." 

The Washington Star says: "Vivid, attractive, and 
Interesting. He has pictured the forces which pulse through 
a growing American community to show the line-up of the 
factors for good and evil in municipal affairs. ... An amus- 
ing view is offered of the inner circle of reformdom, and the 
story moves briskly and with dramatic precision." 

Hart/ord Courant : '* Colton's style is precisely like that 
of no one else . . . the chief charm of his stories, however, is 
not 80 much in their characters as in the way they are told." 

San Francitco Chronicle : " A quiet story told with such 
restraint that It Is only after laying down the volume 
that one realizes the bigness of the problems presented, 
its breadth and richness of thought, and the power of 
its action." 

Philadelphia Prett: "Oenuine humor, true feeling, and 
real artistic instinct." 



NEBRASKA 



$1.25 

A book of conversational autobiography, full of shrewd humor and lively frontier episodes. 

New York Evening Sun : " Uncle Mac is full of wise saws, and, seasoned veteran as he is, has the heart of a child. . . . 
Sitting on the porch of his cottage in the middle of ten acres of orchard and garden . . . Uncle Mac tells the stories ' of the 
golden days when life loomed big before him. . . .' They range from tragic to humorous, and each recites an experience with 
elemental men and crude circumstances." 

Brooklyn Eagle : "An excellent study of frontier life — the Bret Harte flavor is strong." 

Buffalo Express: "Uncle Mac is a great old character." 

Burlington Hawk-Eye : " An amusing and thoroughly enjoyable story . . . some of his sayings deserve to be immortalized." 



Second impression of the late Quy Wetmore Carryl's 

The Transgression of Andrew Vane $1.50 

This is the only one of Mr. Carryl's novels of which the MS. was not burned with his oonntry home. It tells a powerful 
story of certain members of the American Colony in Paris. Two women, American and French, play important parts in

' OUMMER READING," so-called, must he ahsorhing enough to 
^ take the reader along without the least conscious effort, and 
nothing achieves this result better than hooks of dramatic excitement 
or of delightful humor. Here are perfect examples of both classes. 

When Wilderness Was King 

SO SUCCESSFULLY has Mr. Parrish woven a beautiful love 
story around the dramatic struggle for Fort Dearborn that 
his book has proved one of the most popular of the present season. 
There is no doubt about its ability to keep the reader's interest 

— to the exclusion of all his surroundings. Besides, its orna- 
mental features and illustrations make it a most attractive volume 
to have about. 

The Ward of King Canute and 
The Thrall of Leif the Lucky 

ANYONE who has not read these wonderful Viking romances 
by Miss Liljencrantz has a most delightful pleasure in 
anticipation. They are so fresh and vigorous, so full of the 
fire and spirit of the Norsemen, that they stand in a class by 
themselves in modern fiction. They can be unhesitatingly 
recommended to those who appreciate the elusive flavor of true 
romance, nor must their beautiful illustrations be overlooked. 

McCutcheon's "Cartoons" 

THE volume published last year, " Cartoons by McCutcheon," 
is of the variety known as " hardy perennial," because its 
humor is the sort that is just as delightful one year as another, 
and will repay any number of re-readings. This year's volume 

— "Bird Center Cartoons" — seems in a fair way to become a 
classic. Not to be familiar with the Bird Center characters is now 
almost as reprehensible as not knowing one's Dickens — in this part 
of the country at least. These two books are absolutely necessary 
among the furnishings of any properly equipped Summer home.

A REMARKABLE DETECTIVE STORY 

The Darrow Enigma 

By MELVIN L. SEVERY 



Literary World: 

"An exceedingly clever tale; one of the best detective stories that has appeared for 
many a day. Sets a new standard for stories of this variety." 



Cleveland 
Plain Dealer: 

"A detective story 
which is one of the 
best of its class. The 
mystery is preserved 
until near the end, the 
reader as well as the 
characters in the story 
being led to look in 
every direction but the 
right one up to the de- 
nouement." 



JOHN DARROW, seated 
^ in his drawing-room in 
the company of four intimate 
friends, is murdered by an 
unseen hand. All the doors 
and windows of the room 
were shut at the time, and 
no one was seen to enter the 
room. From the minute the 
crime is enacted, through the 
tracking down of the strange 
and baffling clues to the de- 
nouement, the mystery is sus- 
tained and the interest grows. 



Professor 

Harry Thurston Peck: 

"Mr. Severy displays 
a great deal of ingenu- 
ity in the working out 
of the details, and is re- 
markably successful in 
preventing the reader 
from even guessing the 
correct solution of the 
mystery." 



New York Press: 

"Mr. Severy has written one of the best detective stories that we have read since 
Sherlock Holmes made his appearance in the field of criminal fiction."

The Most Interesting and Important Book of 1904 

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY 

Herbert Spencer 



'* Beyond any reasonable doubt it is des- 
tined to take rank as one of the two or three 
most remarkable self-portrayals of a human 
life ever committed to posterity." — Franklin 
H. GiddingSy LL.D., The Independent. 



" The book, as a whole, makes Spencer's personality 
a reality for us, where heretofore it has been vaguer than 
his philosophical abstractions."— John White Chad- 
wick, Current Literature. 

"In all the literature of its class there is nothing like 
it. It bears the same relationship to autobiographical 
productions as Boswell's ' Life of Johnson ' bears to bio- 
graphies."— Philadelphia Press. 

" This book will always be of importance, for, though 
the influence of Herbert Spencer seems to be waning, he 
was a great and original thinker, and his system of phi- 
losophy, whether it stands or falls, has bent the thought 
of a generation and will keep a position of commanding 
interest." —Joseph O'Connor, New York Times. 

" Planned and wrought for the purpose of tracing the 
events of his life and the growth of his opinions, his 
autobiography does much more than that. It furnishes 
us, half unconsciously, no doubt, a more vivid portrai- 
ture of his peculiarities than any outsider could possibly 
provide. We pity his official biographer ! little can be 
left for him. Here we have Spencer in habit as he 
was."— New York Evening Post. 



"It is rich in suggestion and observation, of wide 
significance and appeal in the sincerity, the frankness, 
the lovableness of its human note." — New York 
Mail & Express. 

" As interesting as fiction ? There never was a novel 
so interesting as Herbert Spencer's 'An Autobiography.' 
There is hardly a phase of intellectual or social life on 
which he does not make remarks that are brilliant or 
entertaining or original." — New York Herald. 

" What strikes one first, as he is here revealed, is the 
immense humanness of the man, his varied interests — 
these and his candor, his anxious desire to look himself 
squarely in the face, to see himself as he really is." — 
New York Evening Telegram. 

" It is rare, indeed, that a man who has so profoundly 
influenced the intellectual development of his age and 
generation has found time to record the history of his 
own life. And this Mr. Spencer has done so simply, so 
frankly, and with such obvious truth, that it is not sur- 
prising that Huxley is reported as having said, after 
reading it in manuscript, that it reminded him of the 
' Confessions ' of Rousseau, freed from every objection- 
able taint." —New York aiobe.

THE REJECTION OF POETRY. 

The Poet Laureate of England, speaking 
before the Royal Institution last February, 
made some suggestive observations concerning 
what he called "the growing distaste for the 
higher kinds of poetry " among the English- 
speaking peoples. It is the fashion of present- 
day journalism to speak slightingly of Mr. 
Austin's own performance as a poet, and to 
turn the prejudice created by his poetical pre- 
tensions against his public deliverances upon 
all subjects, which constitutes a distinctly un- 
worthy form of indirect attack upon a writer 
whose prose is always graceful, whose verse is 
at least respectable, and whose opinions are 
those of a gentleman of marked culture and 
reflective power. It is easy to indulge in cheap 
flings at certain of his ill-considered and too 
" timely " poems ; it would be easy, in the case 
of the address now under consideration, to find 
a target for sarcasm in the passage in which 
the author alludes feelingly to the public igno- 
rance of his own " long, serious works "; but 
we prefer to take seriously his argument upon 
a serious subject, and to inquire how far his 
contention is borne out by the facts. 

After defining poetry as " the transfiguration 
of the actual or the real into the ideal," Mr. 
Austin goes on to express the opinion that we 
no longer care for the higher sort of poetry 
as our forbears cared for it. " Men and women 
of a former generation seized with eager hands 
on a new poem, read it with fervent tenderness, 
returned to it again and again, learned much 
of it by heart, and gave it a permanent place 
in their thoughts and affections." At the pres- 
ent time the men and women of whom this may 
be said are few in number. For short poems, 
it is admitted that " there is perhaps as much 
taste and liking as ever," but from a sustained 
poetic flight in the narrative or dramatic form, 
" most readers nowadays turn with invincible 
repugnance." This is a hard saying, but we 
are constrained to believe that it has a large 
element of truth. There is much significance 
in the writer's recollection that in his own 
youth he knew by heart such poems as the 
"Essay on Man," "The Traveller," "The 



354 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Deserted Village," and the "Elegy," and in 
his pertinent question : " Is there a man or 
woman under thirty at this moment who can 
say the same?" 

Among the causes assigned for our modern 
" alienation of taste from the higher, more seri- 
ous, more intellectual poetry" are the preva- 
lence of novel-reading, the newspaper habit, 
and the standards set by the popular stage. 
The novel has ousted the poem because it is 
" better adapted to the capacity of the average 
mind," and unfortunately the novel is read for 
purposes of its own, which are very different 
from those professed by the poem. Instead of 
a " useful tonic" it *' becomes the most depress- 
ing of stimulants," and completely ruins " the 
taste for mental food of a more delicate and 
sustaining kind." As for much reading of 
newspapers, it is bound to dull the literary 
sense and coarsen the intellectual tastes. The 
hurried writing of the journalist gets the hur- 
ried reading which is all that it deserves; yet 
it makes so large a demand upon our attention 
as to preclude most other reading. It gives us 
information at the expense of culture, and 
imperfectly- digested opinion at the cost of 
ripened wisdom. The commercial philosophy 
of the stage does not need Mr. Austin's fresh 
exposition. It was set forth once for all in 
Goethe's " Vorspiel auf dem Theater." 

" Sucht nur die Menscben zu verwirren; 
Sie zu befriedigen ist schwer." 

We all know how the English-speaking stage 
balks at literature, and how disastrous is almost 
invariably the attempt to make it the scene of 
poetic utterance. 

Added to these depressing influences, the 
writer finds two others, one of which is the 
feminization of taste, and the other (as much 
a consequence as a cause) is the fact that 
poetry, in the minds of many worthy people, is 
represented by compositions which are " not 
poetry at all." What he thinks about the in- 
fluence of feminine taste in determining the 
success or the failure of a book, is neatly illus- 
trated by this statement of the average woman's 
attitude toward one of the master poems of the 
world. The " episode of Dido and ^neas is 
the only one in Virgil's great poem that really 
interests them, and they absolutely refuse to 
concern themselves about the Romanam con- 
dere gentem, the foundation of the Empire." 
Now the larger part of present-day readers are 
women, and the interests of women are not, as 
a rule, " as wide and as detached from per- 
sonal issues as are the interests of men." 



There is the argument in a nutshell, and it is 
not easily to be controverted. As for the 
compositions taken for poetry which are " not 
poetry at all," Mr. Austin takes Browning for 
his illustration, quoting for the purpose a pas- 
sage which is really fine, ethically and intellec- 
tually considered, but which has no touch of 
the transfiguring wand which converts the real 
into the ideal. He might have made an even 
more pointed argument by quoting from the 
popular ditties of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. The 
fact that such performances, or the perform- 
ances of, say, Mr. Riley of Indiana, are in 
many quarters innocently assumed to be poetry^ 
offers a convincing and, at the same time, de- 
pressing confirmation of the contention that 
hosts of people nowadays do not know what 
poetry means, taking the term in its long- 
accepted and legitimate sense. 

We have thus analyzed at some length Mr. 
Austin's argument, because it seems to us that 
he has, on the whole, made good his dictum 
that poetry no longer means what it formerly 
did to the public at large. Speaking of our 
own country, Mr. Stedman says : " Its verse 
until the dominance of prose fiction — well into 
the seventies, let us say — formed the staple of 
current reading, and . . . the books of the 
' elder American poets ' lay on the centre- tables 
of our households and were read with zest 
by young and old." Where is the literary op- 
timist who would venture to assert that any- 
thing like this was true at the present day? 
The message of our older poets, it is true, has 
lost something of its timeliness with the lapse of 
years, and they have not found the successors 
that we could have wished; but we doubt 
greatly if a new Longfellow or a new Lowell 
could now become a real force in our national 
life. One of the noblest poems ever produced 
by an American writer has been published 
during the past few weeks, but we do not an- 
ticipate for it anything like popular vogue ; its 
melody will fall upon ears deafened by the din 
of a material civilization, and its stately im- 
aginings will find no general public sense at- 
tuned to their harmony. 

Abundant lip-service, no doubt, is now paid 
to the great poets in both America and En- 
gland. Their names are bandied about in 
journalism and in private converse, and no one 
is too poor to adorn his speech, on occasion, 
with tags and snippets of poetry. We have 
new editions of the poets, also, in a profusion 
formerly unknown, and their volumes orna- 
ment the walls of countless thousands of our 



1904.]

homes. With amazing industry our youth 
also, in school and college, pursue the study 
of literature, and make themselves widely fa- 
miliar with names, and titles, and literary 
origins, and critical speculations. But all these 
things are only the husks of culture, and the 
kernel is somehow missed. The great poets 
ought to be our constant and unfailing inspira- 
tion, and most of us well know that they are 
not. They should occupy the inmost citadel 
of heart and mind, but we keep them outside 
the walls. They invite us to royal banquets, 
while we prefer, as Euskin suggests, to feast 
with scullions. 

Now all this, as Mr. Austin says, with deep 
feeling, matters enormously and vitally. We 
are menaced by what he calls the " cosmopoli- 
tan religion of material prosperity," and in 
what quarter shall we look for refuge ? Let 
him answer the question in his own eloquent 
words. "Where but in the pages of the 
Greater Poets, the Higher Poetry, which pre- 
sent to us a very different conception of the 
meaning, the purpose, and the uses of life, and 
keep steadily before us a worthier and nobler 
ideal. This you will not find in merely lyrical 
or emotional poetry, however beautiful and 
enchanting it may happen to be. . . . The 
spirit . . . requires to be braced by com- 
panionship with the masculine poets, the poets 
who move and enchant, but at the same time 
stimulate and strengthen, by mingling with 
emotion, thought, intellect, and reason." And 
if there is any season of the year when such 
counsel is more timely than at another, it is 
the summer season which brings to most of us 
some measure of relaxation from the engros- 
sing cares of life. Then we repair to the 
mountains or the sea for their tonic influence 
upon our unstrung physical nature ; why should 
we not at the same time repair to the calm 
heights and the free expanses of poetical crea- 
tion for the healing of our souls as well ? 



An important series devoted to " American Jurists " 
is now being actively prepared by Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co, Mr. Harry Alonzo Gushing is the editor of the 
undertaking, which will be planned to interest laymen 
no less than lawyers. Each volume will make plain 
the position of its subject in the development of Amer- 
ican law, and will elaborate the important contributions 
made by him to the present system of American law. 
The first volume to appear will be devoted to Thomas 
M. Cooley, and has been written by Dr. Henry Wade 
Rogers. Among the later volumes will be those of 
Professor John Bassett Moore on William Pinckney, 
Dr. James Breck Perkins on James Kent, and Profes- 
sor Francis M. Burdick on Joseph Story.

AN Era op Flower Books.* 

Two hundred and fifty years ago Sir Thomas 
Browne noted with delight that " new herbals 
fly briskly from America upon us from per- 
severing enquirers." It was a day of flower- 
books, the like of which had never been known 
before ; nor has it been known since till our 
own day. When America was settled by En- 
glishmen the whole world of flowers lay un- 
studied, almost unnoted. There was but one 
meagre list, which was full of "unlearned 
cacographies and falsely-named herbes." The 
eyes of the whole world seemed suddenly to 
awaken to the vegetable world. English schol- 
ars noted with delight the hundreds of plants 
in their own country that had never been de- 
scribed, and they invented botanical terms in 
which to make descriptions. They learned 
with excitement and anticipation of strange 
flowers and trees in the new world. " Joyfull 
Newes out of the New Found World " is the 
exultant title of the botanical book that first 
told of tobacco and other strange American 
plants. Travellers, diplomats, even common 
sailors secured blossoms and seeds and plants 
in " Out-Landish " ports to bring home to pol- 
iticians, physicians, potecaries, herbalists, and 
flower-lovers. Physick-gardens were planted, 
and parties of eager young men, " cullers of 
simples," searched the fields and meadows for 
specimens for gardens and herbariums. It is 
easy to understand why the great costly folios 
of John Gerarde and John Parkinson, the 
works of John Evelyn, John Ray, John Fosr 
ter, John Pechey, John Lawrence, the three 
John Tradescants, and other English "herb- 
johns," found ready and excited purchasers 
among such enthusiasts when these conditions 
existed. But it is not easy to account for the 
great and sudden outburst of garden and flower 
books within the past four years. The one hun- 
dred and thirty odd years that have passed since 
the publication of Horace Walpole's " Essay

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



on Modern Gardening " in 1765, until this our 
year 1904, actually saw fewer newly-published 
books on flowers and gardens than we have 
had in a single year. Each one of these mod- 
ern books has something new to tell the reader ; 
not always news of the flower-world, but more 
often the fresh thoughts and eager hopes and 
happy words of the writer about flowers. When 
in the garden our own Poppy is a deeper and 
more translucent bit of painted ruby glass 
than has ever bloomed before ; when our own 
Larkspur has a taller and stronger stalk, and 
blossoms of more heavenly blue than ever riv- 
alled the sky, — each inspires us to tell the won- 
der and publish the beauty to the whole world. 
The largest and most useful flower book of 
this season is the volume entitled " How to 
Make a Flower Garden." The name of Pro- 
fessor L. H. Bailey as editor is warrant of the 
accuracy and worth of the work ; he also writes 
in his crisp English the chapters entitled " The 
Spirit of the House Garden," " Some Lessons 
from the Pan-American Exposition," "Shrubs 
and Where to Put Them," " The Greenhouse 
in the Snow," " Where Shall We Plant Roses." 
The names of Warren H. Manning, W. H. 
Sargent, W. C. Egan, Patrick O'Mara, James 
J. Allen, and others of note in the plant world, 
show that Professor Bailey has gathered well 
his assistants. The chapter entitled " The Water 
Garden and the Mosquito Problem " will per- 
haps be read with the most eager attention. 
The finely illustrated essay on " Water Lilies 
and Other Aquatic Plants " is written by Mr. 
William Tricker, for whom the Victoria Trick- 
eri was named. A curious illustration shows 
the under side of a leaf of the Victoria Regia, 
displaying its beautiful venation and the spaces 
where air is held. It is a surprise to me to 
see in the accompanying picture the present- 
ment of a stalwart policeman upheld on the 
surface of the water on one of these vast lily- 
leaves; for I recall distinctly the terror I en- 
dured when in my childhood I was placed upon 
the great buoyant leaf-disc of one of these 
whales of the water-plant domain, one of the 
first brought to North America, and felt it 
slowly quiver under me. I recall the equal 
distress of the unhappy gardener when he be- 
held a sturdy child vehemently stamping her 
ruthless way to the safe shore of the tank- 
«dge over the yielding leaf-pulp of his idolized 
treasure. The illustrations for the chapters 
on " Wild Gardens " are beautiful things ; 
indeed the entire series of photographic illus- 
trations in this book could hardly be excelled. 



Among the might-have-beens which are so 
deeply mourned by all wild-flower lovers is the 
orchid-book of William Hamilton Gibson. Of 
this work he gave us glorious promise in a few 
magazine articles. Not only would his won- 
derful pen have written fresh and vivid de- 
scription, but his pencil would have depicted 
faithfully the curious characteristics of the 
smaller orchids which the camera in general 
so blurs through foreshortening that the very 
portions by which identity is established are 
wholly distorted or valueless. In Miss Grace 
Graylock Niles's book, " Bog-trotting for Or- 
chids," the colored plates depicting the larger 
orchids, — the lady's-slipper, pogonia, are- 
thusa, and showy orchids, — afford excellent 
representations by which the hunter of wild 
orchids can make comparisons. All the illus- 
trations of single specimens and flower-parts 
are of value ; but the photographs from which 
the plates were made are evidently much in- 
ferior to those of like scenes and blooms 
which form the illustrations of Mrs. Mabel 
Osgood Wright's " Flowers and Ferns in their 
Haunts." The text is a sketchy account of ram- 
bles in New England, chiefly in the Hoosac 
Valley. Across lots and through swamps, in 
rich meadow, and by huckleberry pastures, 
by mountain brook and old pot-hole, wherever 
heavy bog or peat or mud-bed formed an orchid- 
home, — there searched the author. She had 
a genius for finding the moccasin-flower ; it 
forms the triumph of her book. The six New 
England species, — Ram's head moccasin- 
flower or lady's-slipper, white-petalled or 
showy lady's-slipper, small white or prairie 
lady's-slipper, large yellow lady's-slipper, small 
fragrant yellow lady's-slipper, two-leaved stem- 
less pink lady's-slipper, — are all lovingly 
described and their haunts and habits depicted 
for the reader. Miss Niles tells likewise of 
their transplantal to the garden. Some idea 
of the wonder and delight occasioned by these 
moccasin-flowers when a novelty in English 
gardens in the seventeenth century may be 
gained from the herbals of Gerarde and Park- 
inson. 

It is a pleasure not only to know of Mrs. 
Theodore Thomas's "Mountain Garden"; but 
to learn a little of the home life of the Master 
who has given so much happiness and inspira- 
tion to thousands of music-loving souls. The 
glimpses afforded in his wife's book reveal such 
a nature as we know must be his, — strong, 
direct, loving of all things that need love and 
care. The New Hampshire garden of these

two, made without gardener or even garden- 
knowledge, is revealed to us so fully and so 
frankly that the pages prove a wonderful guide 
to all in like status of ignorance and inexpe- 
rience. The simple accounts of garden-experi- 
ments, and the sensible rules and directions 
evolved therefrom, are far more light-giving 
than the pages of many a more pretentious 
volume. For Mrs. Thomas tells the little 
things that few know and many wish to know, 
and yet are so seldom told. It is ever said to 
garden-beginners, *' You must learn by con- 
tinued experience and failures." Through this 
book we are saved disappointment and loss and 
failure, and are permitted to learn not by our 
own but by Mrs. Thomas's experiments and 
experience. Her lists of hardy plants — 
"proven" as said the old cook-book recipes — 
will be found of distinct value to the garden- 
tyro, not only in saving time but money. 

It often comes to the reader when reperusing 
after some years a book much loved of old, to 
endure a sad shock in finding that the halo of 
memory has been sadly misleading. The in- 
tense delight given by Mrs. Celia Thaxter's 
" An Island Garden " when read fifteen years 
ago might well have grown pale after the many 
fine garden-books of the past few years ; but 
instead a deeper admiration and satisfaction 
comes to us as we turn the pages of the new 
edition, lately published. It is indeed a gem ; 
there are few books to class with it. Forbes 
Watson's " Flowers and Gardens," Euskin's 
"Proserpina," — only such as these can keep 
it company. Buskin and Mrs. Thaxter vie 
with each other in glorious descriptions of the 
Poppy. There was given to Mrs. Thaxter in 
an extraordinary degree a quality upon which 
old Cotton Mather has this to say : " Fascina- 
tion is a thing whereof Man hath more Experi- 
ence than Comprehension." She fascinated all 
who knew her ; and her home, her garden, her 
flowers, were also charming. This inexplicable 
though positive quality did not depend on her 
personal presence, on her beauty or wit ; for 
her charm has never died. That incomprehensi- 
ble magnetism, that power of making and keep- 
ing interest, still lives in the pages of her book. 
This is not like the books of other women ; 
there is about it a subtle something that is as 
intangible as perfume, but is yet real. 

The book by Mr. Charles M. Skinner on 
" Little Gardens " is the very antipodes of 
" An Island Garden." Just as Mrs. Thaxter's 
garden was unique, so is her volume full of 
rare thought and elusive sentiment and poetic 



comparison. Mr. Skinner's book deals chiefly 
with flowers in perhaps the most unromantic 
and undistinguished conditions under which 
flowers ever bloom, — namely, in a city yard. 
For such a subject the hypaethral ecstasy of 
the poet would be ridiculous. Yet there is not 
lacking beauty of thought in Mr. Skinner's 
book ; while for absolute and sensible instruc- 
tion it excels. It is a reasonable book, bear- 
ing reason in its advice, and, since it aims 
to mitigate the ugliness of city life, with a 
distinct reason for being. The author's in- 
structions and plans for little gardens " in the 
half-country " are less pleasing than the city 
chapters, and the flower lists are not so well- 
chosen ; but his words have an earnestness and 
truth that force us to heed them. He dares 
to quote Bacon's " Essay on Gardens," in the 
face of FitzGerald's dictum that the presence 
of such quotations always makes the reader put 
down the volume in hand and fall to reading 
Bacon himself. Alice Morse Earle. 



The IjOVE or the Wild.* 



Can it be that anyone is so out of suits with 
fortune as to lack something to be in love with 
in June? Surely of choice no one would be 
so deprived, nor be content with a placid pas- 
sion. It is the season when we all, for love's 
sake, would be " frantic-mad, with evermore 
unrest." And if we will, we may. For is there 
not a host of lovers rising up to call their pur- 
suit blessed, and to urge us all to join their 
quest? "If you would know the happiness of 
love," they feelingly persuade us, " love the 
small live things of earth — the birds and small 
beasties that make the early summer a tanta- 
lizing joy. Now is the time when nests and

is full of tiny infant songs and chirps. Come 
out, then, with opera-glass and bird-book, and 
join the ranks of the confessed lovers of the 
wild. Truly you may return to the town with 
' hose ungartered, bonnet unhanded, sleeve un- 
buttoned, shoe untied, and everything about 
you demonstrating a careless desolation,' but 
you will return happy, and perhaps a little 
wise." 

These almoners of nature's charms have new 
and alluring things to say in books. For those 
of us who would have some science on which 
to base our devotion, and to whom a bird by 
any other name than its own would not sing 
quite so sweet, there are guide-books with facts 
indubitable. For those who eschew rules and 
reasons, there are " homilies of love " for pure 
enjoyment. 

Mr. Schuyler Mathews's "Field Book of 
Wild Birds and their Music," a volume of form 
and size convenient for actual use in the field, 
is unique in the emphasis it places upon bird 
songs. Not only are the songs minutely de- 
scribed, but the musical notation is given with 
an elaborate key for the benefit of unmusical 
readers. Here we have the whip-poor-will's re- 
iterated exclamation, the screech owl's descend- 
ing tremolo, the pewee's plaint, Bob White's 
whistle, and all the other elusive strains, writ- 
ten down in black and white, with sharps and 
flats, grace notes and trills, phrasing and 
rhythm all complete. Can it be done ? we skep- 
tically question. Not wholly, Mr. Mathews 
admits. " All is a literal transcription," he 
says, "not without certain puzzling phases, of 
course ; for who of us have never been both- 
ered by the rapid performance of expert musi- 
cians ! Naturally, therefore, some of my records 
are imperfect ; indeed, it is safe to add that 
some singers sang a great deal more than I was 
able to put down on paper." It is safe to add, 
too, that no instrument, human or otherwise, 
has just the intervals or just the quality of the 
bird's voice. Nevertheless, Mr. Mathews has 
performed a wonderful service for the bird 
lover, and the accuracy of his notation makes 
it possible to identify many an invisible singer 
by his song. The colored plates with which 
the book is plentifully furnished are also of 
great value ; and if we must submit that the 
robin doesn't look exactly as he is here pic- 
tured, we must remember, too, that the plate- 
maker and the printer are furnished with only 
" limited red, yellow, and blue." These more 
conspicuous features of the book should not 
make us neglect the descriptions of the looks 



and characters of the birds, which are often 
briskly humorous, and always show an ideal 
combination of the lover and the scientist. 

That the passion of the bird lover is equally 
intense and devoted the world over is proved 
by Lt.-Colonel Cunningham's ample volume on 
"Some Indian Friends and Acquaintances." 
Compiled from " a series of note-books that 
were in almost daily use during a period of 
nearly thirty years' residence in India," this 
work is so careful and appreciative as to inter- 
est one in birds and beasts quite unfamiliar. 
After reading it one scarcely knows whether to 
envy or to pity the bird-student who lives in a 
country where "the human inhabitants are free 
from a desire to capture or kill any strange or 
beautiful living thing that they may meet with, 
where they have no youthful hereditary in- 
stinct for bird-nesting, and in mature life no 
natural appreciation of murder as a fine art "; 
and where, consequently, the birds and beasties 
need not be sought out in the country, but 
come to live in one's garden, and often in one's 
house. We may pray for this state of things 
in our own country, — but should we like it in 
India, where the birds are large and raptorial, 
and their brilliant colors are usually the ac- 
companiment of an aggressive, not to say in- 
trusive, disposition? Should we maintain our 
equanimity and our devotion unimpaired if 
crows settled in the garden to dispute our 
right to be there, if kites flew upon us and 
snatched things from our hands, and if mynas 
and cuckoos called and chattered so as to dis- 
turb our early morning slumbers ? Should we 
enjoy having mongooses, bats, frogs, toads, and 
snakes in the garden, more bats and various 
birds in the verandah, musk-shrews and palm- 
squirrels on the floor of the sitting room, lizards 
on the wall, rats on the thin ceiling, mice in 
our books, and jackals in the basement? If 
so, we should be worthy of our love indeed, as 
Colonel Cunningham is of his. 

A volume for pure delight is Mrs. Olive 
Thorne Miller's "With the Birds in Maine." 
The book is not locally limited, in spite of its 
title ; for are not the wooing of the oriole, the 
nesting of the olive-back, the first flights of 
baby red-starts, and the singing- lessons of little 
parulas, matters of prime importance the world 
over? Mrs. Miller is not one of those phil- 
osophers who "fish with a generalization." 
She cultivates her bird friends one at a time, 
and becomes intimate with individuals. The 
tricks and manners, the desires and sorrows, 
perhaps we might add the morals, of each of

them are as real to her as those of her human 
friends. She has gone so deeply into the heart 
of bird-land that she often half apologizes to 
us for her intrusions and her revelations, and 
she knows the hidden truths of bird-life as 
scarcely anyone else does. " The most fas- 
cinating of bird utterances to me," she says, 
" are the low-toned ones not intended for the 
world at large. Not ' talk ' between two, 
neither notes of warning, nor of welcome, but 
plainly soliloquies, murmurs, trills, gurgles, 
and other indescribable sounds, evidently for 
their own enjoyment. Such I often hear over 
my head, or behind my back, when I cannot 
stir without ending them. The finest song, 
and the greatest variety of shouts and calls to 
the general public, give me not half the plea- 
sure I feel when listening to these contented 
and happy little strains that assure me a fellow 
creature finds joy in living, and make me know 
that his life is not passed in constant terror." 

For the new devotee of bird- study who 
would shun detection there is the " Baby Path- 
finder to the Birds," a little volume by Harriet 
E. Kichards and Emma G. Cummings, which 
is so small that it will slip comfortably into 
any pocket and thus bear no witness to inten- 
tions bird-ward. It gives valuable and explicit 
help, however, with a separate page for each 
of one hundred and ten of our commonest 
birds, and numbers which refer the student to 
Chapman's Manual. 

Mr. Ralph Hoffman's " Guide to the Birds 
of New England and Eastern New York is, so 
to speak, a full-grown manual. A welcome 
novelty is a separate key to the birds of each 
season — winter, summer, and autumn — with 
special lists for March, April, and May. The 
descriptions of duck, plover, grouse, and other 
game birds, and of shore and sea birds, are 
unusually full. Best of all, there are ample 
illustrations, and the cuts are wisely made 
most numerous of those species, such as war- 
blers, sparrows, and vireos, that are hardest 
to identify. The text itself is delightfully full 
and accurate, and gratefully free from mis- 
placed sentiment and poetical quotation. 

Lest we should forget that there are other 
things than birds in the realms of nature. Miss 
Margaret Morley tells us a fascinating squirrel 
story called " Little Mitchell." Every child, 
and every grown person who has a child's 
capacity for enjoying simple things, should 
read this tale of the baby bushy who was 
found clinging to a tree on Mt. Mitchell in 
North Carolina, his eyes still unopened, and 



his infant voice lifted in protest against the 
death by starvation that threatened him when 
his mother was shot. Miss Morley rescued 
him, and carried him through a hard mountain 
tramp tucked safely inside her flannel blouse. 
Having brought him up to responsible squirrel- 
hood and gallantly offered him his freedom, 
which he as gallantly refused for her sake, she 
took him to Boston to live a sheltered and 
happy life as her pet and companion. 

More discursive than any of the other vol- 
umes in our present group, and also more 
democratic in its love for wild life, is Mr. Dal- 
las Lore Sharp's " Roof and Meadow." Mr. 
Sharp knows what it is to feed a city-starved 
soul on an occasional glimpse of night-hawks 
and migrating wild geese ; to tramp where 
land and river, sky and sea, meet to make the 
marsh ; to stand *' upright in a hawk's nest, 
sixty feet in the air, in the top of a gaunt old 
white oak, high above the highest leaf, with 
the screaming hawks about his head, and marsh 
and river and bay lying far around "; to meet, 
defy, and spare the giant black snake ; and 
even to carry a ribbon-snake in his hat. He 
writes of these things, and of many others, 
simply, lightly, often wittily ; yet he makes us 
feel in every line the poet's seriousness and 
subtlety. Here and there, and as a matter of 
temperament rather than quotable words, he 
reaches beyond the plane on which man sym- 
pathizes with animal life, to the plane on which 
he feels himself one with that life. He de- 
spises the '' tickle-bird-screamer-naturalists who 
have a mere passing, fashionable madness." 
He is equally intolerant of the mere list-mak- 
ing scientist. " I hardly know," he comments, 
"which state of mind is farther from the mind 
of the true nature-lover — the ecstatic, exclama- 
tory one, that goes chanting rimes and verses 
like priests and spring poets, or the analytical, 
labeling mind, that scours the country with a 
book, finding out what Linnseus, Audubon, 
and Gray called things." He himself is rev- 
erent toward the whole " kingdom of Out-of- 
Doors," which he says most of us do not enter 
because we go in too fast and make ourselves too 
obvious. And he assures us that even when 
we become real naturalists we must not expect 
often to have "those rare moments of wide, 
free vision when we stand upon the heights "; 
for " Pisgah came but once to Moses, though 
his pathway ran forty years through the wil- 
derness." Mr. Sharp takes up explicitly, 
though in few words, the great arraignment 
which the other writers leave more or less im- 



360

plicit — the arraignment of the race that goes 
" clothed in murder." The last pair of wood- 
cocks, which would have kept his marsh '' all 
wild and untamed," are gone, shot down by 
the pot-hunters. Little Aix, the wood-duck, 
whose mother was killed before she could take 
him to join in the fall migration, lived mate- 
less a dreary while in the swamp, and then dis- 
appeared ; for " the gift of beauty is proving 
fatal to the wood-duck. He is so graceful, so 
beautiful in dress, that when any other duck 
would be passed by, he is shot, in season and 
out, just to be looked at, taken home, and 
stuffed." Most cutting of all, the author ex- 
plains that he finally refrained from killing 
the great black snake, '' the dragon of the 
swale," because the redbirds, bluebirds, and 
rabbits suffer comparatively little from him, 
having '^ worse enemies than the dragon, though 
he is bad enough." 

This love of the birds and beasts has its sor- 
rows, then, its baffling failures, its temptations 
to bitterness and despair, — as indeed what love 
has not? Is it therefore unworthy? Truly 
not. The favors may be long to seek and not 
too explicit, but they are doubly sweet for 
their elusiveness. And the search is doubly 
precious because it has no end. If we under- 
stand rightly, we are glad to give ourselves to 
a devotion that passes our utmost endeavor, 
and are thankful that 

" God who gives tfae bird its angaish maketh nothing 
manifest, 
But upon our lifted foreheads pours the boon of end- 
less quest."

An American Animal, Book.* 



The demand for a one-volume account of 
American animals, convenient in form and 
popular in treatment, has been well supplied 
in the patient, wise, thorough, and witty work 
of Mr. William T. Hornaday, director of the 
New York Zoological Park. The sub-title of 
the book, " A Foundation of Useful Knowl- 
edge of the Higher Animals of North Amer- 
ica," is almost too modest a designation ; all it 
means is that in a day of specialization this 
work contains all the special knowledge that 
could possibly be contained in 450 octavo 
pages of small but clear type. The author 

* Thb Amebican Natural Histokt. A Fonndation of 
Useful Knowledge of the Higher Animals of North America. 
By William T. Hornaday. Illustrated. New York: Charles 
Scribner'g Sons. 



covers the entire field of vertebrate animals, 
fish, flesh, fowl, and reptilian, not only in 
North America, where the work is done with 
all thoroughness within the limits assigned, 
but including enough of life elsewhere on the 
earth's surface and in the air above and waters 
under the earth to leave a fully adequate im- 
pression of the whole science of vertebrate 
zoology. 

In his introduction, after discussing some 
technical details of nomenclature, Mr. Horna- 
day contributes a few remarks headed ^' The 
Intelligence of Animals : A Warning," which 
have special application to the controversy 
that has been raging more or less harm- 
lessly of late over the writings of what may be 
called the neo-psycho- zoological school. Mr. 
Hornaday does not believe that the average 
beast is of higher intelligence than the average 
American voter. " The virtues of the higher 
animals have been extolled unduly, and their 
intelligence has been magnified about ten diam- 
eters," he observes. ♦' The meannesses and 
cruelties of wild animals toward each other 
form a long series of chapters which have not 
yet been written, and which no lover of ani- 
mals cares to write." He then goes on to ex- 
cept certain stories from his general charge 
that most of this recent writing is a comming- 
ling of fiction and reality ; but it is note- 
worthy that in this connection he praises most 
where his own personal observations and expe- 
riences have been least extensive. It must, 
however, be quickly added that these observa- 
tions and experiences have been most wide, 
and that no small part of the charm of the 
book is due to the interspersal from opening 
to close of first-hand information. Mr. Horn- 
aday has also a word of warning in regard to 
much of the work that is now being done un- 
der the generic title of " nature study." 
" Twenty-five years hence," he remarks in this 
connection, " some of the courses of study of 
the year 1903 will be regarded as educational 
curiosities." He objects to the plan of begin- 
ning with the lower and less immediately inter- 
esting creatures ; and he inverts the process of 
evolution in his own work, beginning with the 
anthropoid apes and closing with the lancelets. 
In the course of the narrative all manner of 
superstitions are overthrown as far as may be, 
and some matters regarded as doubtful are 
given Mr. Hornaday's full authority. The 
gorilla, for example, does beat its breast when 
enraged, as Paul Du Chaillu said ; the puma is 
" easily found by dogs, chased into low trees,

and shot without danger "; " porcupines can 
not shoot their quills, not even for one inch "; 
the bear is seldom dangerous to man, and the 
deer family is exceedingly so at given times of 
the year ; hawks, with some notable exceptions, 
are beneficial to man, and the nighthawk is a 
goatsucker ; snakes are as '' free from slime as a 
watch-chain "; the living moose is really larger 
than any extinct Irish elk ; the sulphur- 
bottom whale is bigger than any animal the 
fossil remains of which have been discovered ; 
the rattlesnake not only grows two and three 
rattles a year, but the rattles beyond ten are 
discarded through wear ; owls not only do not 
live with prairie dogs, but are seized and eaten 
by the latter if opportunity presents ; hoop- 
snakes do not exist ; the gila monster is not 
poisonous to man ; the bat no more alights in 
human hair " than the humming-bird "; there 
has been only one authentic case of a man's 
death by a shark in American waters, and that 
was in in 1830 ; and so on, through scores of 
equally interesting instances. 

The manner of treatment throughout is not 
merely interesting, it is exceediog witty and 
uniformly readable. For instance, in describing 
the sloths hunted in Guiana by Mr. Hornaday, 
he says, " Judging by the awful deliberation of 
those that we saw in motion, I estimated that 
a really swift sloth could travel half a mile in 
twenty-four hours, if not sidetracked." The 
only defects observable in the work are slight ; 
as for example in the omission of some common 
names such as " milk-snake " and " snapping 
turtle." The pictures, most of them drawings 
by artists of repute, are numerous and excel- 
lent, and the original charts of the first value. 
It would seem that every effort had been made 
by the author to secure accuracy and modernity 
of treatment, and his book is altogether one to 
be prized on every account.

Some of the best novels published daring the past 
year or two by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., a house 
that has always made a specialty of high-grade fiction, 
are now being reissued in popular editions at a low 
price. Among the volumes sent us, we note such ex- 
cellent stories as Mrs, Goodwin's " White Aprons," Mr. 
Sienkiewicz's " With Fire and Sword " and " Without 
Dogma," Miss Charles's «' In the Country God Forgot," 
Mrs. Crowley's " A Daughter of New France," and Mr. 
Le Gallienne's " The Love Letters of the King." The 
books are clearly printed on good paper, well bound in 
cloth, and in most cases supplied with a frontispiece 
illustration. Those in search of desirable yet inexpen- 
sive fiction for vacation reading cannot fail to find some- 
thing to their taste among the volumes in. this series. 



Recent Books of Travel.* 



Mr. Douglas "W. Freshfield's accoant of his joar- 
ney " Round Kangchenjunga " is a real contribu- 
tion to the literature of moantain travel and explo- 
ration. The author is one of the class of moantain 
climbers who look to the hills more for help than 
for information. "I have always climbed" he 
says, " for scenery first, for science afterward, and 
— let me add — for what is included under the 
modern term < records ' last." Hence there is in 
his book an odor of the forest, a vision of rocks 
and snows, of lofty passes and bottomless valleys^ 
rather than a desert of charts and maps. Mr. 
Freshfield and his companions, Professor Garwood 
and Signer Y. Sella, journeyed through Sikhim and 
Eastern Nepal, with the intention of making the 
tour of the great mountain Kangchenjunga, a feat 
that bad not previously been accomplished by Euro- 
peans. They started from the last village of the 
Teesta valley, near the frontier of Tibet, crossed in 
a five-days' march a pass of over twenty thousand 
feet, and within three weeks reached the village of 
Kangbacken in the forbidden land of Nepal. After 
ten days in Nepal the party returned to Sikhim, 
and skirted the southern flank of the mountain, — 
thus accomplishing their aim. It was from the 
Kangchen Glacier in Nepal that the author got his 
most glorious view of the Kangchenjunga group. 
With a reproduction of the magnificent panoramic- 
teleo photographic picture taken by Signor Sella be- 
fore us, we read with interest these words of the 
author :

posed the astounding landscape before oar eyes. Bat it is,

general effect. The individaal features of the landscape are 
not unfamiliar to mountaineers; the Himalayan griants are, 
with a difference, greater Alps ; . . . but the scale was far 
larger and the impression left on the mind one of stupendous 
TastnesB. ... It is no wonder that the Nepalese yakherds 
who penetrate to this spot should regard it as the special 
haunt of the spirit of the mountains, a place where ' Gods 
and saints dwell in great numbers.' " 

Aside from the interest of the book as a record of 
mountain travel, it contains some valuable observa- 
tions on the present relationship between British 
India and Tibet. Mr. Freshfield, who accom- 
plished this trip in 1899, makes some very clear 
and terse statements on the aggressive actions of 
the Tibetans. The volume is illustrated with the 
best pictures of mountain scenery that we have seen 
in many a day. For those who are interested in 
the strictly scientific phases of the region, there are 
excellent tentative geological and glacial maps by 
Professor Garwood. 

Three newspaper owners of Paris, London, and 
New York, respectively, sent Mr. Harry de Windt 
in 1901 on a trip " to ascertain the feasibility of 
constructing a railway to connect the chief cities of 
France and America." Mr. de Windt made a sim- 
ilar attempt in 1896, but met with failure half-way, 
on the Siberian shores of Bering Straits. His sec- 
ond attempt was successful in that he accomplished 
his purpose, but not so successful in regard to prov- 
ing that his footsteps will be followed by a practi- 
cal line of railway. His account of the journey, as 
contained in his book entitled " From Paris to New 
York by Land," is graphically told, with a certain 
air of bravado that is not unpleasing. The party 
of three left Paris on December 19, 1901, bound 
for Moscow, where they met with the usual initial 
delays ; but early in the following year they were 
on their way to Irkutsk, four thousand miles away. 
From Irkutsk they went to Yakutsk, " the most im- 
moral city in the world (with a mental reservation 
regarding Bucharest)"; thence, by hard and starv- 
ing stages, they skirted the Arctic Ocean, and on 
May 19 reached East Cape, on Bering Straits, 
where by rare good fortune they were helped across 
the Straits, and came within sight of their jour- 
ney's end. From Cape Prince of Wales they came 
into the borders of the highly civilized surroundings 
of Nome City, thence to Dawson, and thence to 
Skaguay by the familiar railway through White 
Pass, on by water to Seattle and San Francisco, 
and by rail to New York, which latter city they 
reached August 19, having covered in all over 
eighteen thousand miles. We learn, from one of 
the many interesting and carefully compiled appen- 
dices, that the trip through Europe and Asia from 
Irkutsk was accomplished by the use of eight hun- 
dred horses, about eight hundred and fifty rein- 
deer, and over a hundred dogs. The volume is to 
be commended for its excellent illustrations, and 
especially for its unusually complete index. 

The volume entitled "The Great North-West 
and the Great Lakes Region of North America," 



by Mr. Paul Fountain, is a somewhat unusual one, 
both in its genesis and its execution. The author, 
when a lad of seventeen, made a series of rambling 
trips through the region adequately described in the 
title ; and now, nearly forty years after, he puts an 
account of his travels in print. His wanderings 
included the basin of the Great Lakes on both the 
Canadian ajid the American sides, the Red River 
Valley, the Winnipeg region, Ottawa River settle- 
ments, the St. Lawrence, the Ohio, and the Michi- 
gan " districts," with a side trip into Massachusetts, 
where a Shaker settlement was visited. Mr. Foun- 
tain, who prides himself on being a mere lover of 
nature, confined his rambles almost entirely to the 
wilds, and hence we have readable accounts of our 
backwoods life that has now almost disappeared. 
The book is really a medley of accounts of life 
among the lumbermen, the Indians, farmers, set- 
tlers, and trappers ; of bird and animal life ; of fish- 
ing and hunting trips ; of husking-bees and country 
frolics; and of pungent, indeed rather peppery, 
comments on our national traits of forty years ago. 
There is certainly enough in the volume about our 
Yankee boastfulness, exaggeration, excitability, 
self-conceit, and squeamishness, to account for the 
author's admiration for Dickens's account of 
America. But we forgive Mr. Fountain's restric- 
tions on account of their faint Borrovian touch. 
Perhaps no part of the book is more entertaining 
than the chapter describing " Bees " — meaning 
such affairs as husking-bees, quilting-bees, and the 
like. One excerpt will indicate its quality. 

" It was the time of the ' Indian Summer,' a well-known 
and most delightful season in North America, always eagerly 
looked for ; and the husking took place in the open air. It 
frequently is performed in barns in the winter months ; but 
there is no fixed time for these * frolics ' as they are most 
generally termed — the word ' bee ' being more in use among 
the lower classes, as I should call them; but, in my early time 
at least, one had better have set a match to a barrel of gun- 
powder than to have spoken of lower classes in America. Yet 
there is no country in the world where there is a class held 
in greater contempt than the class that is dollarless in the 
States." 

Following this is a definition of a " cob," taken from 
" Daniel " Webster's dictionary ! 

Mr. William N. Armstrong, a brother of the late 
General Armstrong of Hampden Institute, and a 
member of the cabinet of King Kalakaua (the last 
king of Hawaii), accompanied his royal master in 
the latter's unique tour of the world in 1881, and 
he now publishes an account of the trip in a volume 
entitled " Around the World with a King." The 
party composing the royal retinue on this trip was 
certainly an odd one : a king of absolute power in 
his islands ; the author, an American, who was the 
King's Minister of State ; Colonel C H. Judd, the 
Lord Chamberlain ; and a bibacious German Baron 
for a valet. Their trip was modestly planned so 
as to avoid a possible snubbing from foreign roy- 
alty, yet in the ten months they travelled they were 
received with invariable honors by the rulers of the 
world. Mr. Armstrong, as Prime Minister, evi-

dently had his hands fall in keeping his Majesty 
in presentable shape, while the King himself re- 
turned to his dominions a sadder and a wiser man, 
convinced that his subjects were to be congratulated. 
''They had enough to eat and wear, and they were cer- 
tainly happier than any people he had seen; they were 
never in debt, because no one trusted them ; their kulianas 
(little homesteads) brought them a living; they enjoyed 
music and out-of-door life ; he did not believe that one of his 
subjects ever -went to bed hungry ; no one ever robbed them ; 
they had no dyspepsia, which he said was common in 
America." 

Mr. Armstrong had the wisdom to see the incon- 
gruities of such a journey, and the wit to nar- 
rate them in an unpretentious and entertaining 
manner. The book is illustrated with portraits of 
many royal personages of the period described. 

Very different from the foregoing is the account 
of a trip around the world given by Miss Lina 
Boegli in her very readable book entiiled " For- 
ward." A poor Swiss girl, living in Austria, full 
of dreams of world-travel, " capable of conceiving 
mad ideas and of executing them, too," determines 
to traverse the globe, and allows herself ten years 
in which to do it. Moreover, she determines to 
earn her expenses as she goes, by school-teaching. 
Of a lively temperament, with a keen zest for 
sight-seeing and a will to do, she set out from Cra- 
cow in 1892, on the steamer " Vorwarts " (whence 
the title of her book), going in turn to Australia, 
Hawaii, the United States, and England ; making 
long stays at Sydney, Honolulu, and San Francisco, 
teaching school at each place, and taking side-trips 
in vacation periods ; and finally ending her leis- 
urely but venturesome trip at Cracow in 1902. 
She wrote of her journey to a friend as she saw 
the passing show, and now the account is published 
in its original epistolary form. Here is an item 
that will tickle the vanity of New Englanders : 

" At last I have found the corner of the earth where I 
should like to settle down for the rest of my natural life ; 
that corner is Concord. . . . Not that Concord is so very 
beautiful, — I have seen thousands of places that are far more 
attractive; but this one is just what I would like for a perma- 
nent home : a clean, quiet, restful village, right in the coun- 
try, and yet near enough to Boston ... to keep in easy touch 
with the world. Moreover, the atmosphere seems impreg- 
nated with good, pure, noble thoughts." 

The chief interest of the book lies not so much in 
the descriptions of persons and places, as in the 
frank personality of the writer. 

Quite in contrast with Miss Boegli's leisurely 
journey is Mr. Jerome Hart's hop-skipand-jump 
tour through Spain, an account of which he pub- 
lishes under the title " Two Argonauts in Spain." 
The two argonauts went into Spain from the north, 
crossing the Pyrenees with lingering looks on the 
fair fields of France ; thence, after a glimpse at 
Barcelona, they hastened on to Madrid, where they 
saw the lighter side of Spanish life; then on to 
sunny Andalusia, through Cordova and Grenada, 
finally departing from Seville. The account of 
their jaunt was first published in the form of weekly 
letters to the San Francisco " Argonaut." As 



sketches of travel, the book is light as air, — the 
author frankly avers that the reader will find noth- 
ing in it about religion, revolutions, or politics, — 
but the keen journalistic comments are frequently 
freighted with suggestive common sense, or en- 
livened by a touch of kindly good humor. An 
instance in point is Mr. Hart's conjecture that the 
degeneration of Spain is traceable to the eternal 
rolling of cigarettes, the time lost by that pleasing 
occupation amounting to about " forty million days' 
labor every year ! " 

The sub-title of Dr. R. Logan Jack's "The 
Back Blocks of China " runs as follows : " A nar- 
rative of experiences among the Chinese, Sifans, 
Lolos, Tibetans, Shans, and Kachins, between 
Shanghai and the Irrawadi." This is sufl&ciently 
descriptive of a book relating the experiences of a 
party oi British travellers who, during the Boxer 
rising in 1900, were compelled to leave the Land of 
the Sun by the back-door route. We believe that 
Dr. Jack's record of the conditions and events in 
western China during the Boxer difficulty is the 
only complete published account, and as such it has 
much interest. The party of engineers had been 
examining mining properties in the province of 
Szechuan ; but in the late summer they were forced 
to take flight from Maha, in the valley of the Ya 
Lung, west of the city of Ning Yuan, and they 
arrived at Bhamo on October 21. The hurry of 
the flight did not hinder Dr. Jack from making 
accurate observations of heights, distances, and 
time, with geological notes ; but it prevented his 
making any detailed study of the people, among 
whom he stopped for only brief periods. While 
advocating the partition of the Chinese Empire 
the author says : 

" I doubt, however, whether the resources of any Euro- 
pean, Japanese, or American Power are equal to the task. 
Russia, indeed, may be willing to take the burden, — in a 
general way, she seems inclined to take anything she can 
get, — but it would beggar her and paralyze even her mag- 
nificent organization, . . . The province is the only real unit 
of nati onal life. If ever the provinces of China should assert 
the independence which they have practically achieved with- 
out knowing it, every nation which has an interest in progress, 
commerce, civilization, and peace, will do well to recognize 
them." 

The book bearing the title *' Pioneering in Cen- 
tral Africa," written by the Rev. Samuel Phillips 
Verner, brings before us strange lands, strange 
people, and strange experiences, in a thoroughly 
interesting and vivid manner. As a story of a 
missionary's adventures, the volume is as exciting 
as one could well wish; hair-breadth escapes are 
not few, and even the every-day life seems full of 
excitement of the unexpected and the unknown. 
Intermingled with incidents of adventure are de- 
scriptions of scenery well befitting the weird land 
of Africa. Mr. Verner is appreciative of the won- 
ders of the benighted country, and loses few oppor- 
tunities to show his delight. Sometimes the scenes 
described seem almost too wonderful, the adven- 
tures too remarkable; but Mr. Verner's style is so

plainly narrative, and so evidently sincere, that one's 
doubts fly before it. It is this same sincerity, al- 
lied with a humorous sense of the incongruous, that 
brings the African tribes in their pristine kindliness 
and blood-thirstiness so immediately before us. It 
is hardly necessary to add that the author's primary 
purpose is to arouse interest in the missionary work 
being done by brave men in the heart of the Afri- 
can jungle. 

The very title of Mr. Eugene Andre's volume, 
<' A Naturalist in the Guianas," is a sesame to a 
world of adventures. The author, who for ten years 
has been a collector in Venezuela and Colombia, tells 
in a remarkably simple style the story of his two 
trips up the Gaura affluent of the Orinoco, the land 
of the fabled El Dorado, — "a region of impene- 
trable forests, of open savannas, mountains of fan- 
tastic shapes and surpassing grandeur ; a region of 
abundant rains and rapid rivers — a region rich in 
bird, insect, and vegetable life, but difficult of ac- 
cess and deadly in climate." Mr. Andre's first trip 
to the Caura river was in the nature of a pleasure 
tramp in search of orchids, with Turagua Moun- 
tain, the most important of the mountain masses in 
the region, as the objective point ; while his second 
and more hazardous journey was into the little 
known region of the Merivari River and Ameha 
Mountain. As a naturalist, he of course took his 
keenest delight in the oddities of nature. One can 
readily imagine the pleasure afforded by a sight of 
the following improvised and untrained circus : 

" On more than one occasion I observed capuchins per- 
form an acrobatic feat in the style of the leaping: somersaults 
from the spring board one sees at a circus. If a troop of 
these monkeys while travelling through the tree-tops came 
to a spot where the trees were some distance apart, they 
would run out to the end of some thin, pliable, but strong 
branch, and leap up and down until they caused it to sway 
violently ; then taking advantage of the momentum of the 
swinging branch they would clear the intervening distance 
one after the other, a feat which they would have been una- 
ble^to perform from a stationary object." 

But all was not a circus holiday. On the return 
trip, the work of months was lost by the wrecking 
of a boat containing valuable specimens and photo- 
graphic views, and the author's extensive journal. 
With little food, and a good two hundred miles 
before them, the party of fifteen men set out to beat 
their way back to the nearest station. After twenty- 
eight days of suffering eight starving human beings 
dragged themselves into the settlement at La 
Prision. Mr. Andrd tells his tale in such a pictur- 
esque way that one is tempted to give his account 
more than one reading. The fact that Dr. J. Scott 
Keltie has written an appreciative preface to the 
volume is high commendation of its quality. 

"This is Illyria, lady," the Captain informed 
Viola, and from that time began Viola's troubles 
in love. Likewise Miss Mary E. Durham had many 
humorous affairs of the heart in her travels through 
Illyria, as recounted in a bright and thoroughly 
vivacious style in her volume entitled "Through 
the Lands of the Serb." From her starting point, 



Cetinje in Montenegro, where she received five 
offers of marriage in twenty minutes, to Valgevo 
in Servia, where she dodged a roomful of impe- 
cunious army officers each willing to become a 
Benedict, thence to Belgrade, where she escaped a 
handsome police officer who offered to clear a way 
for her through life, she made a triumphant tour 
through lands that have been the shuttlecocks of the 
nations. It is hardly fair to the author, however, 
to give the impression that her journey (sprightly 
as is her description of it) was a frivolous one, for 
she seems to have touched the life of the Montene- 
grins and the Servians most thoroughly. She points 
out this interesting difference between the two 
nations : 

" During all these years the Montenegrins have been learn- 
ing to obey while the Servians have learnt to oppose all forms 
of government. The subjects of Prince Nicola are disciplined 
and self-respecting ; of those of King Peter it has not been 
inaptly remarked that where there are four soldiers, there are 
five generals." 

We learn from a publisher's note included in the 
present volume that Miss Durham is now in Mace- 
donia. It is to be hoped that she will publish an 
account of her travels there. 

" In the Uttermost East " is the title of one of the 
most substantial and instructive books on the Sibe- 
rian exile system and the Eastern question in gen- 
eral that have recently appeared. In addition to 
extensive travels in Korea, Siberia, and Manchuria, 
the author, Mr. Charles H. Hawes, made a thorough 
investigation among the natives and the Russian 
convicts of the little-explored island of Sakhalin, 
lying to the east of Manchuria and the Amur re- 
gion, far beyond the terminus of the Trans-Siberian 
Railway. As the first English traveller to explore 
the northern interior of the island, Mr. Hawes is 
able to give us many new facts concerning life 
among the convicts in this far-away penal settle- 
ment, and regarding the customs and manners of 
the hitherto undescribed natives — the Gilyaks and 
the Orochons. Concerning morality at this outpost 
of civilization he notes that " there must be a larger 
number of crimes committed in proportion to the 
population on Sakhalin than anywhere else." In 
regard to the natives, we learn that the Gilyak is 
short of stature, wiry, and spare of limb ; his com- 
plexion is tawny and gipsy-like but not yellow, and 
his hair, worn in a pigtail, is black. The Orochons, 
according to Mr. Hawes, are in some respects supe- 
rior to the Gilyaks ; they are probably " a branch 
of the great Tungus race of which the Manchu is the 
most civilized, and the so-called Tungus of Eastern 
Siberia the wildest representative. The Orochon 
is only a little less wild than the Tungus, but he ap- 
pears to have come more in contact with surround- 
ing tribes . . . and to have been influenced to 
lead a rather less nomadic life than the original 
stock." The Orochons are also superior to the 
Gilyaks as linguists, as hunters, and as traders. 
Mr. Hawes has told his story well, and has height- 
ened the interest of his account by many helpful and

interesting sketches and photographs, and a com- 
plete map of his travels. 

Mr. Bart Kennedy, who is evidently a man with 
an open mind and a spirit of camaraderie, tells us 
in his book entitled " A Tramp in Spain " of a 
roving pilgrimage from Andulasia to Andorra. His 
object was to get near the heart of Spanish life : 
*' to go into and explore the towns, to go through 
the mountains, to tramp through country parts, to 
see the cathedrals and places of art on the way ; 
in fine, to see Spain from as many view-points as 
possible." Armed with a revolver, a knapsack, and 
a passport, he thus wandered through Andulasia 
and Granada, lands characterized by the spirit of 
" manana " and inhabited by a charming pleasure- 
loving people. In Guadalajara, the men impressed 
him as a " fine lot of fellows," with broad and rather 
hard faces, suggesting the Scotch, — such men as 
hardly belong to a " dying nation." In Catalonia, 
the inhabitants are described as virile and energetic, 
with a hard look in their faces, but without the 
underlying suUenness that characterizes the faces 
of men in Castile. Throughout his book Mr. Ken- 
nedy casts a rosy hue about the much maligned 
Spanish people, and he takes a particular pleasure 
in ridiculing Americans for pitying them. His 
impression of the working classes in Spain is thus 
summed up: 

" I saw a working people who are better off than our own 
working people. A people with more to eat — a people bet- 
ter housed — sturdier people — a healthier people. In fine, a 
people who got more out of life. They had plenty of bread 
and plenty of wine. They took it easy. They did not have 
to conform to that sinister and horrible paradox — to kill 
one's self to live." 

Mr. Kennedy relates his many interesting adven- 
tures in a decidedly personal manner, his style being 
an odd mixture of the garrulous, the affected, and 
the picturesque. 

Any book dealing with the Balkans is sure to 
prove of lively interest, and almost certain to con- 
tain a prediction of immediate trouble in a region 
where trouble is native to the soil. Mr. Reginald 
Wyon's volume, "The Balkans from Within," is no 
exception to the rule. The author, who spent sev- 
eral years in the Balkan States as a special corre- 
spondent, has made a sympathetic study of the vola- 
tile Albanians, Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bulgars, 
and has written a most readable book about them. 
He states that <' The greater part of this volume is 
occupied with an endeavor to conjure up rough 
pictures of life amongst the sturdy and warlike 
inhabitants of certain Balkan States." That Mr. 
Wyon has a most affectionate regard for these 
people, and a most fervid hatred for their oppres- 
sors, is evident on every page. In view of the great 
Eastern war now waging, the following prediction 
is pertinent : 

" To a very great extent the immediate fate of the Bal- 
kans depends on events in the Far East. . , . Any serious 
reverse to the Russian arms would very likely lead to an out- 
break of a serious nature in the interior of the Czar's do- 
minions, which is seething with discontent. There is not a 



Balkan nation that would not use its advantage to the full, 
for however great Russia's influence may be — with her hands 
free — she is intensely hated by Serb, Bulgar, Greek and 
Turk alike. Montenegro is Russia's only friend . . . and 
Montenegro would inevitably join in the game of grab." 

Over one hundred unusually good illustrations add 
to the attractiveness of the volume. 

The last book on our present list is the impor- 
tant two-volume work by Captain Otto Sverdrup, 
entitled "New Land." Captain Sverdrup, who will 
be remembered as Dr. Nansen's chief lieutenant in 
that explorer's trip into the farthest north, made 
no attempt to reach the pole. His expedition, how- 
ever, was made in Dr. Nansen's famous ship, the 
" Fram," this time fitted out solely for exploration 
and scientific purposes. With fifteen men Captain 
Sverdrup left Norway June 24, 1898, and returned 
in September, 1902, having spent four years of hard 
work in exploring the new land. The region trav- 
ersed and explored by the party covers an approxi- 
mate area of over one hundred thousand square 
miles. The area mapped by the expedition lies to 
the north and the east of Greenland, or more spe- 
cifially to the west of Kane Basin and Baffin Bay, 
and to the north of Jones Sound. The northern 
shore of North Devon was also mapped. King 
Oscar Land, west of Grinnell Land, and EUesmere 
Land, were explored; EUesmere Land being crossed 
for the first time by any explorer. The islands to 
the west of King Oscar Land, and lying north of the 
Parry Islands and King Christian Land, were named 
Amund Ringnes Land and Ellef Ringnes Land, in 
honor of the men who bore much of the expense in 
fitting out the expedition. Isachsen Land was named 
in honor of Captain Isachsen, the cartographer ; and 
the last and largest of the islands in this new region, 
lying immediately to the northwest of King Oscar 
Land, is now called Axel Heiberg Land, after Con- 
sul Heiberg, who was the third man to share the 
expense of the expedition. Captain Sverdrup states 
the main problem of the exploring party as follows : 

" In our over-land journeys from Hayes Sound, we had 
observed that the country was indented by larger fjords, and 
it appeared to me that the best thing we could now do would 
be to ascertain whether or not these fjords were connected 
with Norskebugten or Greely Fjord, or whether there really 
existed a sound northward to Qreely Fjord." 

The problem was solved by Captain Sverdrup, who 
discovered the existence of a sound northward to 
Greely Fjord. 

" Straight across the sound . . . and as far north as we 
could see, the waterway was covered with pressed- up autumn 
ice, horribly difficult to make one's way in, apparently, but 
little we cared for that. We had looked into the promised 
land. We gave a sigh of relief, one and all, and were as 
happy as children over it." 

This brief summary conveys no adequate idea of 
Captain Sverdrup's spirited and noteworthy account 
of his four years' trials in the Arctic regions ; but 
it is all that our space will permit. The volumes 
are well illustrated with over two hundred plates 
and drawings, and are accompanied by a number 
of valuable maps. jj g Coblentz.

Recent Fiction.* 

In « The American Prisoner " Mr. Eden Phill- 
potts gives us something more closely approaching 
the conventional romance than be has written 
hitherto. His work has still the idyllic quality, and 
is strongly flavored with the soil, but it has also 
the interest of ingenious and complicated plot and 
of the historical background. If his " Children of 
the Mist" and other earlier books brought him 
fairly into comparison with Blackmore, our sense 
of his kinship with that writer is strengthened by 
the present performance, which portrays the scenes 
and types of character that Blackmore loved, and 
tells a story almost as fascinating as " Alice Lor- 
raine" or "The Maid of Sker." The scene is 
Dartmoor, and the time that of the Napoleonic 
wars ; or, what is more to the point, of the unhappy 
war between England and the United States. It 
will be remembered that Dartmoor was the site of 
a great war prison, where both French and Amer- 
ican captives were held in durance at the time in 
question. One of these captives, a lusty young Amer- 
ican sailor from Vermont, is the hero of the romance, 
the heroine being the daughter of an English gen- 
tleman farmer living thereabouts. Being a master- 
ful person, and holding the American rebels in de- 
testation, it is natural that he should oppose the 
aims of young love, and a pleasant complication 
results. The book is widely diversified in its inter- 
est, is not burdened with an intolerable weight of 
dialect, and belongs to the class of fiction which, 
while not failing in entertainment, is also literature 
in a fairly high sense. 

Another masterful person, thwarted by a roman- 
tic and disobedient daughter, is presented for our ao-

quaintance in " John Maxwell's Marriage," by Mr. 
Stephen Gwynn. The scene is the Protestant Ire- 
land of the north, the time the sixties and seventies 
of the eighteenth century. The coincidence re- 
ceives still further emphasis from the fact that the 
hero, although an Irishman by birth, becomes im- 
plicated in American history as an agent of the 
Revolution. The story of his marriage, and of the 
important consequences that proceed from it, we 
leave to the reader's investigation, with the assurance 
that he will find the task agreeably exciting. The 
story is a capital one from every point of view, and 
we commend it with a good conscience. 

Dr. William Barry is a novelist who must be 
reckoned with, although his work is very uneven. 
" Arden Massiter " was a story of such remarkable 
quality and romantic interest that the appearance 
of " The Dayspring," a few weeks ago, aroused 
in us anticipations of the most pleasurable nature. 
They have not been altogether realized, for the 
work is rather confused in plan, and weighed down 
with episodes and situations that do not stand in 
very close organic connection with the plot, but 
there is no denying the brilliancy of its detailed 
execution, or the extraordinary energy and vivid- 
ness of the dramatic scenes which are presented as 
the climax in neared. For the rest, it is a story of 
the War of 1870, of the Commune, and of the 
triumph of the Versaillais. The hero is an Irish 
refugee in Paris, who allies himself with the social- 
ist cause, and barely escapes with his life during 
those exciting May days. His love for a young 
widow of the noblesse causes duty to be thwarted 
by inclination, and gives him a di£Bcult course to 
steer. As is quite proper, a lucky escape from 
the difficulty is in the end provided, and we leave 
the happy lovers on the verge of a new life, look- 
ing westward across the seas for their future. No 
one who can appreciate romance of the better sort 
will regret having read this book, even if it does 
fall somewhat below the level of the author's best 
achievement. 

"The Red Leaguers," by Mr. Shan F. Bullock, 
is the story of an imaginary uprising in the Ireland 
of the present or the future. The conditions are 
strictly modern, but beyond that general fact, there 
is no time-indication of a definite character. We 
learn just how the thing is to be done, as the rebel- 
lious Irishman pictures it to himself — how the 
carefully-laid plot and oath-bound league lead to a 
concerted revolt in scores of towns at once, how the 
leaders seek in vain to restrain the passions of their 
men, how the country-side is deluged with blood, 
and how in the end the whole thing collapses through 
indecision and jarring counsels. The story is told 
with considerable spirit, and shows an intimate 
knowledge of Irish character as well as of the life 
of the peasantry. 

Despite their depressing atmosphere and their 
almost morbid point of view, the novels of Mrs. 
Henry Dudeney are so remarkable that they must 
be reckoned with. This writer has heretofore shown

herself to be no unworthy disciple of Mr. Hardy in 
the portrayal of rustic character ; she now exhibits 
in addition much of the power of George Eliot — 
not the creator of Romola and the people of Middle- 
march, but the painter of the " Scenes from Cler- 
ical Life " and the author of ^< Adam Bede." Mrs. 
Dudeney's latest novel, "The Story of Susan," takes 
us into the spiritually murky air of an English vil- 
lage of some sixty years ago. We use this form 
of description because the theme of the work is not 
80 much a study of individual character as it is of a 
certain hard and unlovely type of religious bigotry, 
which merely makes life unnecessarily miserable, 
without offering any apparent compensations. 
Under such an influence a young silversmith and a 
lady's maid — the two leading characters of the 
story — are baffled at every step in the endeavor 
to work out a normal existence, and their lives are 
blighted almost past the saving. A chastened hap- 
piness becomes theirs in the end, after long years 
of spiritual agony which are none the less real be- 
cause the result of artificial causes. They are 
humble folk indeed, but the author's art makes 
them intensely alive, and far more significant in 
their relation to the essential issues of human fate 
than the high-placed figures that people the greater 
part of our popular fiction. Xbe book is art of a 
rare and noble sort, but hardly offers entertain- 
ment as that term is commonly understood. 

"Yarborough the Premier" is a novel of the 
English politics of to day — or to-morrow — written 
with a firm grasp upon the facts of contemporary 
public life, and carried to a striking conclusion. 
The leading character is a man who rises to power 
by the most unscrupulous methods, and is redeemed 
from utter baseness by the sole fact that a deep 
and genuine patriotism provides a sort of excuse 
for his course of trickery and deceit. In the end, 
the fruits of his triumph turn to ashes in his mouth, 
for he has a child whom he idolizes, and this boy, 
learning some of the secrets of his father's career, 
condemns them with all the fearlessness of un- 
tempted youth, thereby embittering the last hours 
of the seemingly successful man. The novel is one 
of unusual strength, and is made all the more un- 
usual (considering its theme) by the fact that it is 
the work of a woman. 

We can hardly congratulate "John Oliver 
Hobbes " upon her latest novel, " The Vineyard." 
To begin with, the title has no meaning whatever 
within the reach of our discernment. That, of 
course, would not matter were the story itself 
reasonably interesting, but it is not. Nothing more 
is given us than a study of the relations between a 
very commonplace Englishman and the two young 
women who alternately or conjointly enlist his 
affections. One of them appeals to his sentiment, 
and the other to his interest, and neither is made 
particularly attractive, whether as a personality or 
a study of character. Of course, there is a certain 
sort of cleverness and hard brilliancy about the 
work, but the performance is greatly inferior to 



what Mrs. Cragie has shown herself capable of 
doing. 

" Susannah and One Other," by Miss E. Maria 
Albanesi, is a story of private life in modern En- 
glish society, and turns upon a rather singular 
complication. Susannah (who is the heroine) is 
persuaded by a wicked and worldly sister to pretend 
an engagement with a man whom she has never 
even seen. This is done to save a delicate situa- 
tion compromising to the wicked sister. But the 
engagement thus entered upon without any serious 
intention comes to have serious consequences. The 
man turns out to be worth loving by the heroine, 
and we soon suspect that he is the " one other " 
of the title. There are difficulties and misunder- 
standings, of course, but the end is satisfactory to 
the sentimental heart, and the book as a whole has 
a sort of unobtrusive charm that makes it pleasant 
to read. 

" Robert Cavelier " is a romance, as few readers 
will need to be told, of the great French explorer 
who first sailed down the Mississippi to the Gulf, 
and added a new realm to the dominions of the 
French king. The book begins with the story of 
the youthful hero, in the character of a Jesuit 
novice, just ready to revolt from the discipline and 
methods of the order. He is speedily rescued from 
that captivity, and brought to New France, where we 
soon find him established in his seigneury of La 
Chine. Then follows the story of his return to the 
Court, and his acquisition of the royal authority for 
the carrying out of his great plan. His years in the 
Western wilderness are swiftly sketched, and we at 
last find him at the mouth of the mighty river, and 
witness his erection of the royal standard. The 
Jesuit intrigues which seek to thwart him through- 
out his career are made to contribute effectively to 
the interest of this simple and straightforward ro- 
mance, which may be commended in sober, although 
hardly in glowing, terms. 

A somewhat more pretentious romance of Amer- 
ican history is entitled " When Wilderness Was 
King," the work of Mr. Randall Parrish. This is 
a story of the Fort Dearborn massacre of 1812, 
told from a close study of the historical records 
available, and shaped into romantic form by means 
of the not uncommon accessories of homespun hero, 
courtly rival, and distressed maiden heroine. The 
historical theme has been used before, but not upon 
so large a scale as the present ; in fact, nearly the 
whole action of the story is concerned with the 
events of three or four days. Within this brief 
period, however, there is condensed excitement 
enough and to spare. The sort of thing may be 
easily imagined, for it has been done a hundred 
times before. The book is exceptionally pleasing in 
its manufacture, and is adorned with a series of 
noteworthy colored illustrations, the work of Mr. 
and Mrs. Kinney. 

The peculiar type of novel based upon the in- 
tense rivalries of competition in the American in- 
dustrial and financial world has become a perma-

nent featare of our current fiction. The novels of 
every season now include several such works, and 
they are apt to be among the best of the yearly 
output. As a concession to prejudice, the love- 
interest is still allowed a certain place in the plot, 
but it is subordinated to the real interest of the ac- 
tion, which centres about some drama of industrial 
leadership, or clash of warring financial interests, 
or unholy alliance between commercialism and poli- 
tics. And, somewhat to our surprise, this new sort 
of story is as absorbing, in its way, as was the story 
of older fashion, which knew nothing of such con- 
ditions or of such a life. We have just been read- 
ing, for example, with deep and unflagging inter- 
est, Mr. Francis Lynde's story of " The Grafters," 
a typical example of the kind of novel here consid- 
ered. It tells us how a young lawyer in a far 
Western city attacked the intrenched forces of 
financial and political corruption, and routed them 
after a desperate and intensely exciting battle. 
They had planned to steal a railroad and give the 
newly-discovered oil-fields of the state into the 
hands of a conscienceless monopoly. In assailing 
these dragons of a very modern type, the hero dis- 
played an energy and a resourcefulness that make 
the exploits of Siegfried seem but a tame achieve- 
ment. His final coup deserves admiration for its 
ingenuity and effectiveness. The book is written 
in a nervous and phonographic dialect, without any 
style worth mentioning, but well suited to the re- 
quirements of the scenes and the situation. It is 
rather too crowded with incident toward the close, 
and rather too technical in its phraseology for the 
average reader, but there is no denying the breath- 
lessness of the interest with which we approach the 
climax of its elaborate and skilfully-contrived plot. 

A second book of this same general type is " The 
Great Adventurer," by Mr. Robert Shackleton. 
Here we have the story of a gigantic Trust and its 
organizer. It is a bigger trust than any hitherto 
created, a very trust of trusts in its far-reaching 
and comprehensive scope. After it has fastened 
its grip upon most of the industries of the nation 
and had its natural consequences of raised prices, 
labor troubles, and general public anathematiza- 
tion, its organizer comes to the conclusion that the 
industrial structure he has reared is a menace to 
the country's safety, and sets about its disintegra- 
tion in his habitual masterly way. The story is a 
dull one, on the whole, although it has a certain 
share of ordinary human interests, including that 
of love, and although a gentleman burglar is found 
among the characters, contributing a novel and 
agreeable diversity. 

Miss Mary Johnston's new book is a great dis- 
appointment. <' Sir Mortimer " is called a novel 
on the title-page, although this is a misuse of the 
word, for the book is romance of the most evident 
kind. But that is a trifling criticism. Our disap- 
pointment arises from the fact that this accom- 
plished writer seems to have forgotten how to tell 
a straightforward story in fitting language. In this 



Elizabethan romance of adventure on the Spanish 
Main, she tells a story that is anything but straight- 
forward, that is thin in real texture, and that seeks 
to conceal its poverty of invention beneath a heavy 
load of rhetoric and verbal ornamentation. This 
affected euphemism is not a good imitation, and 
will deceive no reader of discernment. The trick 
of Elizabethan mannerism intrudes upon us at every 
point, clogs what action the story has, and leaves 
on the whole an unpleasant impression. As for the 
hero, we venture to think that so impossible a fig- 
ure has rarely been projected into a work of fiction. 
We are almost inclined to say that Miss Johnston's 
first book was her best, and that she has steadily 
declined ever since. Certainly her " Prisoners of 
Hope" had real distinction of style and real fresh> 
ness of invention, and we doubt if she has quite 
equalled either in her later books. 

No season of American fiction would be complete 
without a romance of the Revolution ; for the pres- 
ent season the want is supplied by Miss Mary G. 
Francis. " Dalrymple " is the title of the book and 
also the name of the hero. The period is between 
the evacuation of New York by the Continental 
forces and the evacuation of Philadelphia by the 
British. During most of this time the hero is an in- 
mate of the prison-ahip "Jersey," and it was for the 
special purpose of making her readers acquainted 
with the horrors of that particular form of durance 
that the author wrote her book. In this matter she 
has relied chiefly on Dring's " Recollections." The 
heroine, as usual, meets with the determined oppo- 
sition of the Tory uncle who has her in his charge, 
and is wooed in vain by a British officer. As usual, 
also, the hero and the British officer afterward meet 
on the field of battle, and the latter is defeated in 
order that his life may be magnanimously spared 
by his victorious rival. We should really feel de- 
frauded did not this situation occur at the proper 
juncture. Miss Francis puts a good deal of reason- 
ably accurate history into her work, and her perform- 
ance is a fair average example of the class to which 
it belongs. William Morton Payne. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



The hero of the Baroness von Hutten's latest novel, 
" Violett " (Houghton) , is the son of a man executed for 
the murder of the little girl whose kinsman, guardian, 
and heir he was. As the child grows up he displays softie- 
thing akin to genius as a musician. His first associations 
are with a family of music hall performers, — father, 
mother, and daughter; his next with the musically edu- 
cated and highly cultivated daughter of a neighboring 
clergyman. The action of the book, it should be stated, 
takes place on the English coast and in London. The 
boy, overshadowed by the horror of his father's fate, 
naturally refuses to take the fortune for which the 
crime was committed, and this rejection breaks off the 
mercenary marriage with the daughter of the theatrical 
family, who promptly marries within the profession. 
The hero is taken up by a great master of the piano, a

man of genius rather than of character. The music 
hall girl is maltreated by her husband, and Violett goes 
back to her. The end is tragical. It may be seen 
from this bald statement of the argument how much 
opportunity is given the author for noting the interplay 
of character coupled with environment, and probably 
no higher praise can be accorded her work than to say 
she has made all the resulting developments as con- 
vincing as they are interesting. 

After proving his knowledge of the life of the New 
England coast through a number of well written short 
stories and a book of verse, Mr. Joseph C. Lincoln has 
now achieved an excellent piece of sustained fiction, 
•'Cap'n Eri: A Story of the Coast" (Barnes). Three 
old fishermen, of that Yankee type which lends itself so 
well to genre work of this sort, are keeping house with- 
out feminine assistance in a manner so wholly unsatis- 
factory that in desperation they draw lots to see which 
one of them shall marry. The unfortunate one on whom 
this duty devolves advertises, with the assistance of his 
comrades, for a helpmate, and in response comes just 
the sort of woman no one could have expected under 
the circumstances, — a thrifty and capable widow from 
a seaport not far away. She reduces the domestic 
chaos to order, but, through an accident befalling a 
neighbor, is compelled to remain in the house without 
any understanding from the shrinking swain who adver- 
tised. The comedy of this situation is abundantly re- 
lieved by a pretty, youthful love story, by the actuali- 
ties of life in a small village by the sea, and by the 
unfailing good sense and good nature of " Cap'n Eri." 

An unusual tale of mismating and unhappiness is 
told by Miss Katherine Maokay in " The Stone of Des- 
tiny " (Harper), in which a man of aspirations both 
humane and artistic is wedded to a sensual woman 
whose sole interest lies in matters of the body rather 
than of the soul. The man feels the growing interval 
between them, and endeavors to bridge it over. The 
wife makes no effort to restrain him at the end, though 
for a time the lures by which she had won him are 
tried until their inefficiency is demonstrated. The man's 
mother is the best of the characters in the story, a 
high born and highly bred woman whose understanding 
with her son is perfect and whose influence is for good 
whenever it can be exerted. At the climax the wife, 
whose misfortune seems to be temperamental, falls in 
love with another, but refuses his advances because of 
her feeling of motherhood ; and the book closes with the 
problem decided, seemingly, by the man's acceptance 
of all the consequences of his own error. Though brief 
the story has literary merit, and offers much food for 
thought. 

A straightforward historical romance constructed 
out of unhackneyed materials will be found in Miss 
Josephine Caroline Sawyer's " All 's Fair in Love " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.). The time is that of James I. 
of Scotland, the scene for the most part the court of 
the regent of the northern kingdom, the Duke of Al- 
bany. The characters are all of noble blood. The son 
of the Earl of Douglas and the exiled scion of the house 
of Percy, Earl of Northumberland, are the joint heroes; 
the daughter of the house of Neville, Earl of West- 
moreland, and an untitled descendant of a Scottish king 
are the heroines. The book concerns itself first with 
the fortune of one, then of the other pair, though all 
four personages are intimately involved from the be- 
ginning. There is a flavor of high chivalry in the con- 
duct of Douglas, a sweet femininity about Eleanor 



Neville, that are altogether pleasing, and the tale 
makes good and interesting reading. 

" A Country Interlude " (Houghton) is Miss Hilde- 
garde Hawthorne's tale of a world-weary girl who, with 
her mother, after many years of fashionable life seeks 
refuge in their old home, far from city influences and 
life. At the time of her voluntary and most welcome 
exile the girl is betrothed to a man of great estates, a 
charming fellow of the pleasure-loving class, a man of 
affairs and not of sentiment. A neighbor who as a boy 
was a pet of the mother's has grown to be a painter of 
marked skill and reputation in the intervening years, 
and bis friendship with the family is taken up again. 
The girl being a lover of birds and flowers, of sim- 
plicity and sweetness, the inevitable happens as grace- 
fully as needs be, the interval being filled in with a minor 
love story between the local clergyman and a fashion- 
able frivolous girl friend. The story, told throughout 
in the almost obsolete form of letters to a friend, is 
idyllic and charming to a marked degree. 

Politics is the dominant note in Mr. Arthur Colton's 
«< Port Argent " (Holt), and something more than the 
ordinary philosophy that characterizes reform literature 
is to be found in the book. Mr. Colton places political 
control of the Western city that lends its name to the 
book in the hands of a young engineer, a man who is 
used to getting work out of men. He continues to get 
work for the public good out of his henchmen, working 
with imperfect instruments toward a praiseworthy end. 
But in the process he has to turn sharp corners with 
his conscience. Though of vital importance, the point 
made is one little considered, especially by such men 
as are typified in this work in the person of a popular 
preacher-lecturer, unattached to any church but an 
ardent and uncompromising believer in ideals. There 
are other elements besides politics in the book, including 
love as a matter of course, with the young engineer and 
the lecturer as rivals for the hand of a girl steeped 
through comradeship with her father in the ideals of a 
passing generation of Americans. 

The reader of Miss Margery Williams's " The Pride 
of Youth " (Macmillan) will experience a real sense of 
deprivation in that the promise of the opening scene, 
with its deliciously contrived situations and dialogue, 
should not have been a better foretaste of the quality of 
subsequent chapters. Yet, with this said, all the fault 
has been found that need be. A girl on the New Jersey 
coast, living a life in which everything grates upon her 
and tends to drive her to recklessness, meets a Phila- 
delphia newspaper man who is still in the " literary " 
stage of his journalistic development. . Really incapa- 
ble of comprehending one another, he with that vast 
ignorance of womankind that makes judgment so easy, 
and she with ideals that she drives herself to conceal 
only too effectually, they drift into what passes with 
both for love, and he drifts out again, — all in the space 
of a summer's vacation. The interplay of characters 
upon one another is most commendably brought out, 
and constitutes the chief interest of a praiseworthy 
book. 

Mr. David Graham Phillips's "The Cost" (Bobbs- 
Merrill Co.) is if anything a profounder analysis of hu- 
man motives and character than any of this writer's ear- 
lier books. John Dumont and Hampden Scarborough, 
men of strong yet opposite characters, are in love with 
Pauline Gardiner. Knowing her parents' well-founded 
objections to his suit, Dumont persuades her into 
a secret marriage. Not long after, she meets Scar-

borough, and the two fall deeply in love. When the 
two men take up the duties of life, Dumont finds his 
abilities trend toward trust organization. Scarborough 
develops power as a public speaker, and takes the side 
of the man against the dollar. Pauline is forced to 
leave her husband through the openness of his wrong- 
doing, and he makes himself a mighty financial power 
in Wall Street. The scenes in which he is first over- 
thrown in the Stock Exchange and subsequently recoups 
are among the most powerful in recent fiction, and with 
them may be named another scene in which Scarbo- 
rough is nominated as governor in spite of moneyed 
opposition. 

Those familiar with Mr. Stewart Edward White's 
«' Conjuror's House " and *' The Forest " will find the 
same material used in them commingled in his latest 
work, " The Silent Places " (McClure, Phillips & Co.). 
The story has to do with the pursuit of an Indian who, 
having made default in his debt to the Hudson Bay 
Company in the far North- West, flees into the wilder- 
ness. One of the two couriers sent to bring him back 
to justice is a man old and wise; the other is in the 
prime of manly strength. Through the recklessness of 
the latter, a young Indian girl escapes from the alien 
tribe into which she has been adopted, and takes up her 
path with the two whites. By reasop of this circum- 
stance an accident befalls the younger man, greatly 
delaying their search. The wonders of the northern 
forests through all of the four seasons, as well as the 
contrasts between youth and age, feminine devotion and 
masculine power, the intelligence of the Caucasian and 
the instinct of the Indian, are all finely drawn, while 
the knowledge of nature informs every page. 

As in her former books, Mrs. Lucy Meacham Thrus- 
ton makes the Old Dominion the scene of " Where the 
Tide Comes In " (Little, Brown, & Co.). Her hero in 
this case is a man of fine Virginia traditions, but some- 
what too preoccupied with his love for a charming girl 
to display these traditions in practical working for the 
benefit of his fellow-citizens. Most of the action con- 
centrates itself about the girl he loves, who is the 
daughter of a gentleman truck farmer aot far from 
Baltimore, himself amassing wealth rapid iy through his 
closeness to tide water and so to the New York market. 
Some of the difficulties presented by the negro problem 
appear in the book, as if to remind the North that its 
ignorance on specific points is profound. The sunni- 
ness and cheer of the South, as well as something of its 
shiftlessness, show here and there, and the atmosphere 
is unquestionably fully localized. There are several 
interpolated episodes not closely related to the rest 
structurally, and at the close the hero redeems himself 
by political activity. 

A social rather than a racial problem forms the theme 
of Mrs. Mary Tappan Wright's «« The Test " (Scribner), 
setting it far apart from its predecessor, *• Aliens." 
In this newer novel a young girl, affianced to an erratic 
but lovable fellow, yields herself to his desires on 
his plea that it will hefp him to walk the straighter 
by giving him a feeling of possession. This done, he 
drinks too much, falls under the temporary domination 
of a girl in a distant city who has always wished him 
for her husband, and marries her. His father has served 
as a senator of the United States, and has been utilizing 
the girl's intelligent services in the care of his corre- 
spondence and the preparation of a history of his times. 
He stands her friend when the trouble comes, while her 
widowed mother, in outraged respectability, turns upon 



the girl and rends her. In the course of years the 
patient sufferer redeems herself in the eyes of the rest 
of her townsfolk, small-souled as most of them are. 
The situations in " The Test " are powerful and con- 
trolled, and the book deserves well of those with a 
taste for true literature. 

Ranging from Nat Turner's negro revolt, through 
the entire course of the Civil War, Mr. George Morgan 
has material enough for several volumes in •' The Issue" 
(Lippincott). His characters, so far as the imagina- 
tive portions of the story are concerned, are Southera 
men and women of wealth and station, while historical 
personages are freely drawn upon for vraisemblance. 
The chief heroine — one of several — is a young girl 
left an orphan by Turner's massacres, adopted by a rich 
planter, taken from him through a false assertion of 
parentage by a kinsman's machinations, encouraged in 
Methodist exhorting, and at last becoming an army 
nurse. There is much fighting and some good descrip- 
tions of battles, culminating at Gettysburg; much love 
that fails to run smooth; and considerable authentic 
history, — including two or three brief sketches of Lin- 
coln, which are faithful, though not flattering. 

Regret at the untimely taking off of Hugh Stowell 
Scott (Henry Seton Merriman) will be enhanced by 
the perusal of a posthumous volume made up of short 
stories. Not one of the nineteen tales contained in 
•< Tomaso's Fortune, and Other Stories " (Scribner) fails 
to show the firm touch and literary quality with which 
this young man treated events that might otherwise 
have been dismissed as sensational. All manner of men 
in all sorts of places during the last century enter into 
these interesting pages, and with them women of nearly 
every rank in life. There is a manifest partiality for 
the Latin countries and their peoples, often presented 
in contrast with English folk abroad, the racial dif- 
ferences of temperament — or the lack of it — being 
contrasted with complete intelligence. The author's 
standard of work in this volume is uniformly high, 
whether the medium be a novelette, a short story, or a 
mere conte. 

Out of the plains come the materials utilized to 
advantage by Mr. W. R. Lighton in «« Uncle Mac's 
Nebrasky " (Holt). It is of the old days when Nebraska 
was much larger than it is now and was still a territory 
on the borders of civilization that Uncle Mac tells his 
yarns, which have everything in them that we are accus- 
tomed to regard as peculiarly Western. There is much 
humor of the broadest sort, and there are Indians galore, 
cattle thieves, marshals and sheriffs, adventures by flood 
and field, shooting and strategy, politics, tenderfeet, and 
all the apparatus necessary to bring out the characteris- 
tics of a typical frontier scene. Uncle Mac leaves the 
impression of being a good man to have on one's side in 
an emergency, with a certain feeling of thankfulness 
that he is permitted to pass his age under conditions 
less strenuous. 

A great variety of well handled material has gone 
into the making of "The Rainbow Chasers" (Little^ 
Brown, & Co.), by Mr. John H. Whitson. Arkansas, a 
terra incognita to the American novelist, is the scene of 
the opening chapters. The hero falls into evil ways, 
and flees from his home with the accusation of murder 
upon him. He becomes a ranchman, and purges his 
soul of its supposed guilt by long communings with 
nature. Later he leaves the employment he could not 
like, falls into a particularly well described fight with 
desperadoes, and begins his real career as a real estate

agent in a booming town near the frontier. Here he 
works out his salvation with the assistance of an excel- 
lent girl whom he has saved from death in a blizzard. 
Like so many contemporary American novels, the book 
is valuable as a study of men and manners of a day 
already passing. 

That Russia stands so friendless before the civilized 
world to-day is in great part due to the seventeenth 
century methods used by her government in dealing 
with the Jewish inhabitants of the land. In " The 
Fugitive" (Doubleday, Page & Co.) Mr. Ezra S. 
Brudno, a Jewish lawyer of Cleveland, presents a 
minute description of the horrors of the Kishienev mas- 
sacre, in which the hero of his most unconventional 
story plays an active part in the futile attempts at pro- 
tection made by his co-religionists. This hero is a 
Jewish student of theology, a mere child when his par- 
ents die as a result of Russian persecution. His career 
is traced through successive stages in Russia and Po- 
land, until he comes finally to the United States and 
finds peace in the successful practice of medicine. It is 
not as a work of fiction, but rather as a vivid recital 
of cold facts, that the book makes its main appeal. 

Irish stories of unusual worth, based upon the ancient 
religion of the country, are set forth by Mr. Aldis Dun- 
bar in " The Sons o' Cormac, an' Tales of other Men's 
Sons " (Longmans, Green, & Co.) . A gardener from the 
" ould turf " is made to narrate them one by one, to the 
young sons of the house during their vacation, the me- 
dium being a rich and not always consistent brogue. 
Not only is the resulting series of tales of the ancient 
and almost forgotten gods excellent reading at just this 
time when the Irish language and traditions are excit- 
ing unusual attention, but they are worth knowing for 
their own sake as a permanent contribution to the best 
fairy stories of the ages, suggesting a wide and little- 
worked field. We earnestly wish for more of them in 
the near future from the same hand, and it would be a 
favor to the elders of those to whom they are more espe- 
cially addressed if their sources could be disclosed, 
assuming they are not purely Mr. Dunbar's inventions. 

It is curious how America, the home of the story of 
crime and mystery, has permitted the French and En- 
glish to develop her own literary invention. But Mr. 
Melvin L. Severy, in "The Darrow Enigma" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), has done an interesting thing in bringing 
into abrupt contrast two men of the older and newer 
types, the Sherlock Holmes of the plot getting the better 
of its M. Dupin, who here becomes the villain. It might 
rationally be objected that in the development of the 
plot there is too much rambling over the earth's sur- 
face, in an attempt to bring into the play of char- 
acters something of the quality of Wilkie Collins's 
" The Moonstone," with its oriental possibilities. Yet, 
in spite of its derivational character, the " mystery " 
remains a real one until near the end, — which after all 
is the essential thing. 

Gardening and urban rusticity, now so popular; love, 
which is always popular; and ease of living, the great 
desideratum of most of mankind: these are the factors 
that act and react through Mr. Halliwell SutclifiFe's 
" A Bachelor in Arcady " (Crowell), leaving an impres- 
sion so pleasant that one wonders that Mr. Sutcliffe has 
not tried something of the sort before. Rural England, 
a young land-owner who likes to putter around his gar- 
den, bis father's friend the squire, the squire's daugh- 
ter, playmate of his youth, and the worthy couple that 
do the bachelor's housekeeping and gardening for him, 



are the chief elements in the desultory narrative. There 
are reflections about many things, rambling disquisitions 
about nothing in particular, and some mild adventures 
that take on flavor by contrast, — all going to make up 
a pleasant book. 

The joy of young life and high spirits are always 
manifest in Miss Frances Aymar Mathews's work, and 
"Pamela Congreve" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is no ex- 
ception. The time is that of the last quarter of the 
eighteenth century, and the scene begins in rural En- 
gland, transferring itself quickly to the London play- 
houses, where the beautiful heroine scores a great success 
and is beloved of half the nobility — half of its men, 
that is. She returns with some condescension the affec- 
tion of a duke, while a noble earl who has known her 
previous to her triumph endeavors to force himself upon 
her and, failing there, to carry her off by main force. 
Sprightliness is the best word to apply to the narra- 
tive, with its social and histrionic plots and counterplots, 
and its wits and beaux, courtiers and belies, for char- 
acters. 

There is a suggestion of a better natured Sherlock 
Holmes back of the hero of Mr. van Tassel Sutpben's 
" The Gates of Chance " (Harper), with the further dif- 
ference that he is a New York man of wealth, leisure, 
unquenchable curiosity, and insatiable desire for ad- 
venture. He early picks up the young newspaper wri- 
ter who tells the story as it discloses itself in a series 
of seemingly unrelated episodes with eccentric, unfor- 
tunate, and criminal men and women, as well as with 
those in more normal circumstances, the whole coordi- 
nating at the close into a little love affair with the usual 
romantic conclusion. The book is wholly entertaining, 
and suggests a career for its author as a writer of thor- 
oughly modern American " detective stories." 

So far as literary conventions permit, the author of 
the anonymous novel, "I: In Which a Woman Tells 
the Truth about Herself" (Appleton), carries out the 
assertion of the title. She discloses the feelings of 
an ugly duckling changing into cygnethood as has sel- 
dom been done before. Most of the subsequent detail 
of the story, however, is devoted to telling the truth 
about her husband and about the wealthy man who 
sought to tempt her, and they are painted in no pleas- 
ant colors. When one recalls some of the greater books 

in which men and women have revealed their hearts 

such books as those of Pepys and Rousseau and Marie 
Bashkirtseff, — the real revelation of this newer tale 
dwindles into insignificance, and most readers will be 
disposed to resent the evident deception. 

Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin's " Four Roads to Para- 
dise " (Century Co.) is a story of life in contem- 
porary New York, the scene shifting to Rome, and 
thence back to the United States. The title of the 
book is based upon a quotation from the Talmud, 
used as a prologue: "Four men entered Paradise; one 
beheld and died, one lost his senses, one destroyed the 
young plants, one only entered in peace." A young 
widow, come in possession of a great fortune by her hus- 
band's will, most of which will go to his blood kin in 
the event of her second marriage, is the principal fig- 
ure in the series of romances that make up the book. 
A young and spiritually ambitious clergyman of the 
English church holds the attention at first, but after he 
reads a letter entrusted to him by a dying woman for 
delivery to the widow, with whom he thinks himself in 
love, Mrs. Goodwin very properly degrades him from 
his heroship. The book is one of merit.

[Jane 1, 



Mr. Herbert Quick's aptly named book, " Aladdin 
& Co." (Holt), is the real romance of a firm of young 
men who undertake the booming of the city of Latti- 
more, in the middle West, the period being some fifteen 
years ago. The partner who tells the story marries 
early in the narrative, and the thread of love that runs 
through the commercial and financial transactions there- 
after appertains to his old schoolmate and business asso- 
ciate. At the close of a period of remarkable growth 
and development, the hard times intervene to spoil the 
partners' best laid plans, — but not until they have ex- 
hausted all the possibilities in seeking to avoid the crash. 
A run on a locomotive made against time during the 
crisis forms a thrilling incident. 

In all of the fourteen stories that make up the con- 
tents of Miss Frances Aymar Mathews's new volume, 
"A Little Tragedy at Tien-Tsin " (Robert Grier Cooke), 
there is a reaching out for the unusual and extraordinary 
that lends an aspect of originality to the entire book. 
Several of the stories, being those in the place of honor 
at the beginning of the book, have to do with Chinese 
life as affected by intercourse with Caucasians, and the 
strength and weakness of both races are presented im- 
partially. From these Chinese stories there is rather an 
abrupt departure to tales of rural Canada and America, 
and to others of an historical nature. Great versatility 
and marked talent characterize the volume as a whole. 

Short stories, most of them drawn from business life, 
make up Mr. Robert Barr's volume called " The Woman 
Wins" (Stokes). The title is a shrewd one, founded 
on the fact that though all the woman wins in every case 
is a mere man, at some stage in the proceedings she 
evinces a distinct purpose not to let him get away. It 
is with telegraph operators that Mr. Barr concerns him- 
self chiefly, a worthy body of men and women who have 
received little previous attention from writers of fiction. 
Lawyers come in also, one painter, a writer of tales, 
some stock speculators, an automobile manufacturer, 
and an engineer; while the scenes vary from Chicago 
to New York, rural England, London, and even Cairo. 
There is a great deal accomplished in almost every 
«tory, and every one of them is well put together and 
smoothly written. 

That familiarity with life in both America and En- 
gland is not as rare to-day as it was a brief generation 
ago is proved anew in Mr. William H. Rideing's " How 
Tyson Came Home" (John Lane). Tyson is English- 
born but bred in the far West, where he has stumbled 
upon a mine that makes him rich. He returns to the 
native land he has been idealizing through the years of 
exile, and there his ideals are cruelly shattered. The 
close of the book is not entirely conclusive, but several 
of the characters, notably the English girl and the 
Western girl who play so large a part in Tyson's devel- 
opment, are clearly and admirably drawn. It is not a 
pleasant picture that Mr. Rideing draws of aristocratic 
society in Britain, though his animadversions are evi- 
dently well-founded. 

A little city in the West, settled by Easterners, is the 
scene of Mrs. Sara Andrew Shafer's "The Day before 
Yesterday" (Macmillan). The book is concerned with 
the life of a little girl, who has her share of the strange 
joys that fall to childhood, and even more than her 
share of kinsfolk to complicate and mystify her rela- 
tions to the universe. The word idyllic may best be 
used to characterize the story, though there is a deter- 
mination of character on the part of the small protago- 
nist that could scarcely be termed idyllic. Mrs. Shafer's 



manner is unobtrusively psychological throughout, and 
her book has much of the peculiar excellence of Mr. 
Kenneth Grahame's work in the same field. 

The title-story in Mr. Charles Bloomingdale's " The 
Failure " (Lippincott) is a bit of twentieth century 
fatalism, the hero having every characteristic that 
should make for temporal success and with the power 
to enforce it. As a lad, in college, and in business, he 
comes close to attainment, but without gaining the 
crown of actual achievement. Unfortunately for the 
purpose of the tale, the author's heart seems to have 
failed him at the close, and he gives his hero success in 
the love of a girl who, in similar case, had not before 
made the most of her own life. " The Failure " occu- 
pies about two-thirds of the volume; the five remaining 
stories are little more than sketches, journalistic rather 
than literary in treatment. 

"TheMicmac" (Holt) is a well developed bit of 
social drama, written by Mr. S. Carleton. AH the ac- 
tion takes place in the Maine woods, where a young 
New York man of great wealth has spent his summers 
since boyhood. He has fancied himself in love with a 
young widow, but when she comes upon him under con- 
ditions wholly lacking in artificiality his liking turns to 
distaste, though in a moment of physical proximity he 
makes her an offer of marriage. Later he chances upon 
the daughter of a neighboring farmer, and nature 
strikes a spark between the two at first sight. In the 
serious comedy that ensues, a large swamp intervening 
between the young man's habitat and that of his lover 
plays an important part. The book as a whole displays 
considerable talent. 

A party of young men sail down the Mississippi from 
some point not far from Marietta on the Ohio River, and 
the account of their journey to New Orleans is pre- 
sented in " The Ark of 1803 " (Barnes), by Mr. C. N. 
Stephens. It is in time for the hoisting of the stars 
and stripes over the newly acquired Louisiana Pur- 
chase that the young fellows arrive in New Orleans. 
They have many exciting adventures on the way, and 
prove themselves good frontiersmen by slaying Indians 
in open fight during their journey. The book is writ- 
ten for boys rather than for adults, and is notably free 
from love-making and giving in marriage. 

Miss Clara Morris's latest novel has little in it to 
remind one of her former literary work, though it 
would not be difficult to trace analogies between her 
art as here displayed and the spirit that has animated 
her successes on the stage. " Left in Charge " (Dil- 
lingham) is a harrowing tale of farm life in Illinois 
before the war, in which a woman betrayed into a 
bigamous marriage in Canada comes with her little 
child to her sister's house, finds herself cheated out of 
her patrimony by her kinsfolk, and is forced to do the 
most servile labor in return for her sustenance, in spite 
of the rapidly growing wealth of the family. The 
moral issue is distinctly complicated by the avaricious 
sister's illness, and nothing whatever comes of the stolen 
inheritance of the heroine, however much insisted upon 
at certain stages in the narrative. 

"The Wood-carver of 'Lympus" (Little, Brown, & 
Co.) is a Vermont story by Mrs. M. E. Waller, far out- 
side the common run of fiction. A powerful young 
farmer in the Green Mountains, ambitious for an edu- 
cation, is stricken by a tree be is felling and doomed 
thereafter to a bedridden life, his legs being quite im- 
potent. A chance-comer, a rich young New York man 
of affairs, interests himself in the cripple, and puts him

in the way of learning to carve in wood and of market- 
ing bis work. Interwoven with this are the threads 
of several other lives, all making it possible for the 
stricken young man to have his share of the great 
world's interests and beauties. 

The Germans of Pennsylvania, commonly called the 
" Dutch," have appeared but seldom in American fic- 
tion, though they have preserved through many gener- 
ations of life in the new world the habits and customs 
of the fatherland, and have invented a quaint jargon 
out of the vocabulary and idioms of both English and 
German which deserves the attention of writers of 
dialect. Miss Helen R. Martin has made good use of 
this dialect, and of the hypertrophied thrift and reli- 
gious eccentricity of the people, in "Tillie: A Mennon- 
ite Maid" (Century Co.). The story is excellent in 
its delineation of the high aspirations of the heroine, 
who makes her first appearance as a poorly clad and 
rudely spoken daughter of the people, the ideals of life 
waking in her through the kindly ministrations of her 
teacher, a Kentucky gentlewoman. 

An authorized translation has been made by Sukae 
Shioya and Mr. E. F. Edgett of " Nami-ko " (H. B. 
Turner & Co.), the best of the novels of Kenjiro 
Tokutomi, himself one of the best-known of modern 
Japanese novelists. In spite of certain idiomatic diva- 
gations, the result is most interesting. The work is 
avowedly of the realistic school, and except for certain 
European suggestions of manner the theme is typically 
exotic, having to do with the intention of the mother of 
a young naval officer to put away his recently married 
wife, solely because she has become a consumptive. 
There is a tragic note throughout, but the story is told 
with much tenderness of feeling. 

Murder and sudden death stalk through the pages of 
"A Broken Rosary" (John Lane), the work of Mr. 
Edward Peple. An evil woman, an unscrupulous physi- 
cian, a hasty slayer of his friend turned priest, and 
one or two others of less consequence, contrive to keep 
the short narrative filled with all sorts of things, the 
time being that of the reign of Louis XV. of France. 
There is, in fact, so much action that Mr. Peple has no 
time to devote to graces of diction, but hurries his 
readers breathlessly through episode after episode to a 
problem left unsolved at the close. 

" The Gordon Elopement " (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 
is the result of collaboration between Miss Carolyn 
Wells and Mr. Harry P. Taber. The plot is slight, the 
" elopement " being that of a husband and wife who, 
weary of keeping house and of being hospitable, flee to 
a hotel otherwise deserted though in complete running 
order. There they are joined by several others, one 
pair of whom fall duly in love, and there they all have 
a jolly good time, in which the reader cannot fail to 
participate. The characters and situations throughout 
have a pronounced Stocktonian flavor. 

So simply and convincingly does Mr. A. F. P. Har- 
court tell part of the story of the Sepoy rebellion in 
" The Peril of the Sword " (H. M. Caldwell Co.), that 
it is almost impossible to believe it is not a recital of 
personal experiences. The defense of the Residency at 
Lucknow is the episode about which most of the occur- 
rences of the book revolve, the bravery and hardships 
of the little garrison being detailed with sympathetic 
fidelity. Pen pictures are given of Havelock, Outram, 
Campbell, and many minor figures. There is a slight 
love story running through the work, but the main in- 
terest is historical.

a novelty to come upon a book that 
not only discusses the subject of farming from the 
standpoint of financial profit, but asserts the social 
and ethical value of agricultural life. Such a book 
is Mr. Arthur Henry's "The House in the "Woods" 
(Barnes), in which are presented the same charac- 
ters that made their appearance in his first book, 
" An Island Cabin." These three young people, 
weary of city life and ways, resolve upon a " return 
to Nature." During a vacation trip to the Catskilla 
they chance upon an admirable location, in the midst 
of beautiful scenery and a population near enough 
to be available and yet not imminent enough to be 
obtrusive. The two protagonists purchase the land, 
and partially erect a modest house thereupon. It 
then becomes necessary to retire to the city to earn 
more money. After a long period of patient and 
successful labor, they return with suflBcient means 
to go to work in earnest. The house is completed, 
barns and stables are added, more land is acquired 
and placed under cultivation, various live stock is 
bought and installed, and the money laid out so well 
that in the end the hard-working pair find them- 
selves in possession of a competency for life. The 
various details of how all this is accomplished go to 
make up an interesting story; and though Mr. 
Henry's philosophy is occasionally a little trite, the 
book has a flavor and merit quite its own. 

A , «,„„.. The volume on " Musk-Ox, Bison, 

A spirtsmanU ' . ' 

book of Sheep, and Goat, m the "American 

Biff Gam*. Sportsman's Library" (Macmillan), 

maintains the high literary standard set in the 
earlier volumes of the series. Mr. Caspar Whitney 
writes entertainingly of his experiences in a winter 
trip to the *' Barren Grounds *' of Canada in pur- 
suit of the musk-ox. These harmless, stupid crea- 
tures fall an easy prey to the hunter who has the 
hardihood to brave the dangers and take the risks 
of a winter journey over the treeless plains of the 
frozen north. The sport lies in reaching rather than 
securing the quarry. The chapters on the mountain 
goat and big-horn sheep are by Mr. Owen Wister, 
who writes with his usual dash and freedom of his 
own hunting days in the Teton range. There is a 
note of sadness in Mr. George Bird Grinnell's ac- 
count of the bison, now extinct save for a few sur- 
vivors in the National Park and some wood bison 
reputed to be in hiding in the remote confines of 
Athabasca. The almost complete extermination of 
this monarch of the plains within the memory of 
living sportsmen is a prophecy of the speedy fate 
that awaits all of the larger animals of our plains 
and forests unless legal protection is not only af- 
forded but enforced against both local and foreign 
vandals. National parks and forest reserves when

few representatives for the pleasure and instruc-

safeguard would be a widespread public sentiment 
against the wanton and useless killing of these ani- 
mals, who have no chance against the resources and 
equipment of the modern big-game hunter. 

Believing that there is need for a

cupy a place midway between the 
large scientific treatises and the smaller popular 
manuals, Prof. John Henry Comstock and Mrs. 
Anna Botsford Comstock, of Cornell University, 
have prepared a volume entitled " How to Know 
the Butterflies " (Appleton), the particular design 
of which is to provide an accurate yet not unduly 
technical aid to those who are taking up for the 
first time the fascinating study of these <' frail chil- 
dren of the air." The authors have restricted their 
field to the Eastern United States, but as the spe- 
cies described are of widespread distribution the 
book will serve its purpose in almost any section of 
the country. The first part consists of a general 
account of the butterfly, — its relations to other 
insects, its structure, clothing, metamorphoses, and 
ways of life. Then follows a complete scientific 
classification of the various species, with descrip- 
tions concise in form yet full enough to enable the 
collector to identify his specimens with some degree 
of certitude. A separate section is devoted to the 
skippers, which, though commonly classed with the 
butterflies, the authors believe constitute a distinct 
superfamily. An important feature of the volume 
lies in its series of forty-five plates, made from life 
by the three-color process. Though it would be 
impossible to do justice by mechanical means of 
reproduction to the beauties of the butterfly, — 

'' The velvet nap which on his wings doth He, 
The silken down with which his back is dight, 
His broad outstretched horns, his hairy thighs, 
His glistening colors and his glorious eyes," — 

these attempts are at least successful enough to 
form a valuable aid to identification. A number 
of quotations from the poets relating to butterflies 
are scattered throughout the book, pleasantly diver- 
sifying its pages. 

The improvement in the optical and 
Nature.>iudy wuh mechanical parts of the compound 

the mxcroscope. . S i .1 

microscope in recent years, and the 
perfection of micro- photography, have brought 
within the reach of the amateur student of the 
minute things in nature a new world of wonders. 
One of these amateur naturalists, Mr. J. J. Ward, 
of the Birmingham Microscopists' Union, has util- 
ized a series of excellent micro-photographs of ob- 
jects ordinarily examined by beginners in micro- 
scopy, for the illustrations in his book on " Minute 
Marvels of Nature" (Crowell). This is in no sense 
a text-book or manual of microscopy after the man- 
ner of the encyclopaedic works of Pritchard and 
Carpenter, but rather a brief popular description 
in untechnical language of such simple objects as 



may be examined with the microscope without the 
elaborate, expensive, and tedious processes of the 
modern biological laboratory. The book is there- 
fore written entirely for popular use from the 
point of view of the amateur, and is in no sense a 
scientific treatise. The chapters of the book are 
reprinted from various popular magazines of Great 
Britain, but the work is not in consequence of mere 
local interest, for the objects dealt with, or others 
similar to them, are of world-wide distribution. 
The reader is instructed in the anatomy of stems 
and leaves of plants, introduced to the beginnings 
of plant life, the structure of sea-weeds, and to the 
animal forms often regarded by the uninitiated as 
sea-weeds. The eggs of insects, the biting or suck- 
ing mouth parts which afford them weapons, the 
marvellous ribbons of teeth from snails, and the 
larva and imago forms of aquatic insects are all 
well illustrated. 

An experiment Since the first publication, some 
in personal fifteen years ago, of Mr. Philip G. 

emancipation. Hubert's "Liberty and a Living," 
the conditions deplored by the author at that time 
as tending to a perversion and waste of human life 
have increased many fold. Never before did we 
pay so high a price for the money we earn, our 
cities were never so overcrowded, our commercial 
activity has reached the status of a mania, and our 
national strenuousness in all directions has passed 
into a proverb. The new edition of Mr. Hubert's 
book now published (Putnam) has therefore a 
decided pertinence and timeliness, and its moral 
takes on a new emphasis in the light of present 
conditions. For those not acquainted with the book, 
it should be said that it is the work of a man who 
decides to discover whether existence is not pos- 
sible under more rational and congenial terms than 
are exigent in the life of a newspaper hack in New 
York. With his family he takes up a small country 
homestead on the New Jersey coast, and there con- 
trives, by gardening, fishing, bee-keeping, and other 
rural occupations, eked out with the modest earn- 
ings of his pen, to secure a due share of those things 
that make life really worth the living. His enter- 
taining account of how this was accomplished is not 
offered with the desire of gaining imitators, but 
merely as embodying some useful suggestions for 
those who would like to exchange the low ceiling of 
the city for the sky of the country without thereby 
subjecting themselves to physical or moral starva- 
tion. It is a worthy practical accompaniment to 
the eloquent theory of M. Wagner's book on " The 

Simple Life."

game with scientific precision from a practice that

seems to leave little to be desired. As a result she 
particularizes to an extent that supplies the veriest 
novice with a fund of information of the first value. 
Preliminary chapters on the implements of the game 
are followed by minute instructions for their discrim- 
inating use. Attitudes and the manner of holding 
the hands and swinging the clubs are not only de- 
scribed, but Mrs. Stout has been photographed and 
the photographs reproduced in her book in order to 
leave nothing in doubt. It may be said that in spite 
of the contortions seemingly essential to champion 
form, these pictures add greatly to the aesthetics of 
a game too predominantly Scotch to have in it 
much of beauty. In spite of its inclusive and en- 
cyclopaedic character the book lacks an index, which 
should be supplied in subsequent editions. By way 
of offset, to this deficiency, there is added a chapter 
of " Impressions of American Golf " by Miss Rhona 
K. Adair, who has been three years the English and 
five years the Irish Open Champion among women. 
She has many pleasant thingstosay about America, 
and is evidently enjoying everything in her visit to 
this country — with the exception of the recalcitrant 
and contumacious American caddy. 

"Getting Acquainted with the Trees," 
A tree book y^ j^^ j Horace McFarland, is a

book calculated rather to open the 
eyes, quicken the appreciation, and awaken the 
curiosity of its readers, than to furnish them with 
scientific information of a systematic and exhaustive 
variety. It consists of eight informal essays deal- 
ing with a few of our commonest native tree fam 
ilies. These are intended, so the author tells us, to 
be " punctuated with tree walks," and they will cer- 
tainly add interest to such walks, particularly those 
of the spring and early summer, when the trees are 
in their too often unregarded blossoming. Mr. Mc- 
Farland modestly asserts that he is only " a plain 
tree-lover "; he writes of what he has seen and en- 
joyed, and when occasionally he mentions some- 
thing that does not lie within his personal knowledge 
he advises his readers to investigate it for them- 
selves. His method will appeal to beginners in tree- 
study, and encourage many who have been repelled 
by its difficulties. Mr. McFarland is an expert 
photographer, and has furnished his book with many 
artistic and interesting illustrations. (Outlook Co.) 



A record 
of yachting 
in America. 



It is gratifying to note that the 
" American Sportsman's Library " 
(Macmillan) is not to be given up 
wholly to an exposition of ways and means for 
taking life, but that American sport in its more 
manly and less sanguinary aspects is to be afforded 
some recognition. The first volume in this new 
section of the enterprise is Mr. W. P. Stephens's 
" American Yachting." The book is not, as might 
be expected, a hand-book of practical information 
for the yachtsman ; nor does it have much to say 
of the pleasures and benefit to be derived from 
this form of sport. It is rather an historical account 



of the development of American yachting, from the 
first definite records early in the last century to 
the present period of indisputable supremacy. The 
contests for the " America " cup of course form the 
main thread around which Mr. Stephens's narra- 
tive is closely woven. The account is one of great 
interest, and Americans may well take pride in its 
perusal. 



Notes. 



A one- volume popular edition of the poems of Edward 
Rowland Sill is announced by Messrs. Houghton, Miff- 
lin & Co. 

" Japan, by the Japanese " is the title of a book to be 
issued shortly by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., in which 
various phases of Japanese life are discussed by the most 
eminent Japanese authorities. 

" An Elementary American History," by Mr. D. H. 
Montgomery, is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It 
is a good book, born of much experience in the writing 
of school texts, and may be confidently recommended. 

Miss Margaret E. Noble, who for a long time lived 
in the Hindu Quarter of Calcutta, has written a vol- 
ume of observations of life in India, to be published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. under the title "The Web 
of Indian Life." 

"Venice," by Herr Gustav Pauli, is the second 
monograph in the series of " Famous Art Cities " im- 
ported by the Messrs. Scribner. The translation is by 
Mr. P. G. Konody, and the illustrations are both numer- 
ous and pleasing. 

A collection of " The World's Great Orations," edited 
by Mr. Sherwin Cody, will be published at once by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co , who will also shortly add 
a volume of " Sermonettes " by Lamennais to their 
beautiful little series of " Helpful Thoughts." 

Volumes V. to VIII. of Mrs. Paget Toynbee's edi- 
tion of the Letters of Horace Walpole are to be pub- 
lished this month. These volumes include 819 letters, 
written between November, 1760, and May, 1774, and 
sixteen illustrations in photogravure, four being por- 
traits of Horace Walpole himself. 

Four more volumes of the " Mermaid" books, in their 
tasteful new form, are imported by the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner. They comprise two volumes of Beaumont and 
Fletcher, edited by Mr. J. St. Loe Strachey; Dekker, 
edited by Mr. Ernest Rhys; and "Nero and Other 
Plays," six works edited by various hands. 

The 1904 edition of " The Complete Pocket-Guide 
to Europe " comes to us from Mr. William R. Jenkins. 
This multum inparvo of a guide-book has been before the 
public for many years, and its usefulness is approved. 
The fact may be forgotten that it was originally planned 
by a poet and a physician — Messrs. E. C. Stedman 
and T, L. Stedman, — whose names still adorn the title- 

The library edition of Tourgu^nieff now being pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Scribner, having completed the 
longer works, now enters upon the short stories, of which 
there are to be no less than seven volumes. The two 
now published (X. and XI.) contain five stories each, 
among which are " The Jew," " Mumu," " Three Por- 
traits," and "The Diary of a Superfluous Man." The 
translation is by Miss Hapgood.

Mr. Robert Bridges is responsible for " The Roose- 
velt Book " of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. This 
is a small volume of selections from Mr. Roosevelt's 
various writings, and contains many precepts which no 
less a personage than the President of the United States 
would do well to take into prayerful consideration. 

" Australia, Our Colonies, and Other Islands of the 
Sea," by Mr. Frank G. Carpenter, is published by the 
American Book Co. as a new volume in the series of 
" Carpenter's Geographical Readers." The same pub- 
lishers send us a volume of " Lives and Stories Worth 
Remembering," compiled for school use by Miss Grace 
H. Kupfer. 

A new edition of John Fiske's " Civil Government 
in the United States," that best of elementary text- 
books upon this subject, comes to us from Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It has been revised by Mr. 
D. S. Sanfurd, who has made some important additions 
to the text, notably in the chapter devoted to municipal 
government. 

Three volumes of " Pioneer History Stories," by Dr. 
Charles A. McMurry, are published for use as school 
readers by the Macmillan Co. " Land and Sea," " The 
Rocky Mountains and the West," and " The Mississippi 
Valley," are their respective subjects. The style of the 
books is simple and pleasing, and there are real illus- 
trations in abundance — not imaginary pictures. 

A very timely book, by an author of authority, is 
" America, Asia and the Pacific," with special reference 
to the Russo-Japanese war, by Dr. Wolf von Schier- 
brand, which Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are hurrying 
through the press. Dr. von Schierbrand is already 
very favorably known as the author of " Russia : Her 
Strength and Weakness," and "Germany To-day." 

Many readers forego the charms of Horace Wal- 
pole's correspondence because the mass of it is so great 
as to seem formidable. Such readers may be tempted by 
the small volume of " Letters of Horace Walpole " just 
published in the " Caxton " thin paper series, and im- 
ported by the Messrs. Scribner, The selection and 
editing are done by Mr. C. B. Lucas, who gives us the 
epistolary cream of many volumes in one small book. 

A poem of some two score stanzas by Mr. Bliss Car- 
man, entitled " The Word at St. Kavin's," has been pro- 
duced in an edition of three hundred copies at the 
Monadnock Press for the Scott-Thaw Co. The text is 
printed from old-style type on hand-made paper, with 
rubricated initials, and a frontispiece and title-page bor- 
der engraved on wood by Mr. Thomas Maitland Cleland, 
forming altogether a pleasing and distinctive piece of 
bookmaking. The poem itself is a plea for simpler and 
saner ideals of living, a creed that Mr. Carman preaches 
at all times with logic and eloquence. 

A batch of new publications from the Field Columbian 
Museum has just been received by us, and are devoted, 
for the most part, to the Indian subjects of which 
the Museum has always made a specialty. The most 
voluminous of these publications are the collection of 
" Traditions of the Arapaho," made by Messrs. George 
A. Dorsey and Alfred L. Krober; and "The Ordibi 
Summer Snake Ceremony," a monograph by Mr. H. R. 
Voth. A supplementary study, also by Mr. Voth, is 
given to "The Ordibi Odqol Ceremony." Mr. Dor- 
sey writes a smaller volume on " Traditions of the 
Osage." Catalogues of Californian mammals and of 
the Compositffl of Yucatan are other publications of 
this institution.

IS it a pleasant hoiu- 
with Nature you 
wish ? Or would you 
confirm a recollection of 
some point brought up 
during a recent outing, 
identify a species, or put 
your finger on some fu- 
gitive fact in Nature? 
These are but a few of 
the many uses the books 
have, aside from their 
principal value as a com- 
plete guide to the study 
of American Natural 
History, and their at- 
tractiveness as entertain- 
ing reading. 



rllE Nature Library arrived Saturday 
ajlernoon, and has indeed proven to be 
all you represented it. I have studied Dame 
Nature from ConnectictU to Texas and from 
Tennessee to California and I assure you that 
what The Nature Library says is so near the 
truth in all it says that no further search is 
necessary. The illustrations are magnificent 
and as true to life as art can make. I have 
never before seen such beautiful illustrations of 
nature in print. I consider that my money has 
been unusually well invested and sincerely hope 
that every American who has the preservation 
and knowledge of wild things at heart will 
purchase a set of these books. To any lover of 
nature these books will certainly prove a boon 
indeed. I expect to use them constantly, even 
in my professional work, and especially in my 
leisure hours in the woods and wilds.

THE WISCONSIN JUBILEE. 



The story is told of an estimable lady in one 
of our Western cities that upon a certain occa- 
sion when she was entertaining a German per- 
sonage of ancient and aristocratic lineage, she 
sought to impress him with the antiquity of her 
household belongings, " All the furniture in 
thif diioing-rpQpi istirenty-jfiye yeara old," she 



said with an air of importance. But the distin 
guished guest somehow was not impressed as he 
was expected to be, a fact afterwards accounted 
for by one of his suite, who slily remarked that 
his master when at home was accustomed to 
dine in a hall of which the furnishings were 
upwards of a thousand years old. 

It is a very modest antiquity that is connoted 
by the term of a quarter-century, but some- 
times it is the best that we can do. Here in 
Chicago we can now and then "point with 
pride " to some object or institution that ante- 
dates the Great Fire — and that means a full 
generation past, — but any European can hum- 
ble us to the dust by a casual observation. 
The older sections of the country can do better 
than we, and when their commemorations of 
past occurrences have a national character we 
may lay some sort of claim to a share of the 
glory. In these matters, we are already on the 
eve of a long series of tercentenaries, and we 
doubt not that, when the time comes, the Da- 
kotas will be found taking a lively retrospective 
interest in the settlement of Jamestown, and 
Oregon will share with Massachusetts in glori- 
fying the voyage of the Mayflower. We have 
the right feeling about anniversaries, anyway, 
and it would be a cruel critic who should have 
the heart to scorn our well-meant endeavor to 
annex as much of the past as we may, and to 
brighten our young lives with the dim reflected 
splendors of the bygone ages. 

These remarks have been suggested to us by 
last week's celebration at the University of 
Wisconsin. It was only a jubilee — a poor 
period of fifty years — that was celebrated, 
and to reckon the exact term of half a century 
required some ingenuity. The history of the 
university began with that of the State in 
1848 ; its fiftieth commencement was held a 
year ago, and the celebration of the present 
year is the fiftieth anniversary of that event. 
But there was a new president to be installed, 
and the proper year of jubilee had gone by 
without special observation, and it would not 
become us to carp at the slight chronological 
irregularity of the recent doings. We are 
glad that the University of Wisconsin had 
fiCty years (or more) to celebrate, and that the 



388 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



occasion was taken to emphasize its past history 
and splendid growth. Did we not rejoice when 
our own University of Chicago ended its first 
decade and celebrated its little ten-year term 
with a big demonstration ? And shall we not 
also rejoice in the half-century of the neighbor- 
institution, the pride of the State with which 
our own fortunes came once so near to being 
joined ? 

The University of Wisconsin, without years 
approaching those of Bologna or Heidelberg, 
or even those of the three American institu- 
tions which have celebrated long-term histories 
— sesquicentennial, bicentennial, or quarter- 
millennial, — during the past two decades, has 
probably meant as much for the lives of the 
young men and women whom it has touched 
since its founding as any older university has 
meant for its students and alumni during the 
same period. It has reached out to the re- 
motest corners of a great commonwealth, dis- 
covered here and there the exceptional youth, 
held him for four years under its shaping 
influence, and sent him back to his special 
community with broadened outlook, higher 
ideals, and finer purposes than he had when 
he left home. A glance over the list of grad- 
uates for any two or three recent years will 
show better than verbal argument how wide- 
spread has been this educational influence. 
Hardly a town in the State will be found unrep- 
resented ; it must be a small hamlet indeed that 
does not every year or two send its student or 
students to the central educational institution 
at the capital. Some students are attracted 
from outside Wisconsin also, but the number 
is small in comparison with that of the stu- 
dents whose homes are within the limits of the 
State. In this respect, the contrast between 
the great State Universities of the West and 
the great private foundations of the older East 
is very striking. 

To serve as the capsheaf of the educational 
system of the commonwealth, to unite its parts 
into an organic whole, and to reach out in all 
directions for the purpose of giving as well as 
of receiving — these seem to be the true func- 
tions of the State university, and Wisconsin 
has fulfilled them with singular thoroughness 
and success. It has joined practical with ac- 
ademic aims so wisely that it has won the con- 
fidence of the taxpayers of the State, whose 
appreciation is evidenced every year by gener- 
ous appropriations. By thus shaping its course 
with an eye to its agricultural and mechanical 
coQstitueacy, it has showo something of the 



wisdom of the serpent, yet has not failed in 
its respect for strictly academic ideals. To the 
Wisconsin farmer it is an institution that is 
worth supporting because it pays, distinctly 
and directly ; to the country at large it is an 
institution which honors scholarship and helps 
the higher interests of civilization. 

The celebration of last week went o£F with 
the usual accompaniments of such functions, 
and some unusual ones determined by the ex- 
ceptionally beautiful situation of the university 
buildings. The new president was duly in- 
stalled in the office which he has already oc- 
cupied for some time, and the distinguished 
guests of the occasion were properly compli- 
mentary to the great institution of which he is 
the head. His own words were of a nature to 
reveal him as a man of broad views, and of 
ambitious ideals for the future of the Univer- 
sity. And surely a glowing forecast is permissi- 
ble in the case of an institution which numbers 
its students by thousands, which now has hun- 
dreds of graduates every year instead of the 
two who were graduated at the commence- 
ment of fifty years ago, and which has set 
so distinguishing a mark upon the character 
of the commonwealth which is honored by its 
presence. 

In closing these remarks about the institu- 
tion now fairly launched, with clear skies and 
prosperous breezes, upon its second half-cen- 
tury, we are bound to acknowledge our own 
debt to the University of Wisconsin. The 
Dial has only a scant quarter-century of com- 
pleted history, but no year of that period has 
passed without substantial help from Madison. 
Presidents Bascom, Chamberlain, and Adams 
are numbered among our most valued contrib- 
utors; that great historical student, William 
F. Allen, made of our pages for many years a 
medium for the publication of his scholarly 
investigations and reflections ; while among liv- 
ing members of the faculty we are deeply 
indebted to the learned collaboration of Profes- 
sor Jastrow, Professor Ely, Professor Haskins, 
Professor Olson, Professor Turner, Professor 
Scott, Professor Sharp, Professor Anderson, 
and others. To them, and to the institution 
whose reputation they have so worthily sus- 
tained, we extend our cordial greeting, and 
our confident hope that the University of Wis- 
consin may during the coming half-century 
continue to extend its usefulness and its influ- 
ence at the constantly accelerated rate which 
seems to be warranted by its past and by the 
measure of what it has already achieved.

It is now some five years since the earlier 
volumes of Murray's great definitive edition 
of Byron's works were reviewed in The Dial 
(May 16, 1899). Twelve volumes were then 
announced : six of Poetry and six of Letters 
and Journals. Mr. Murray has, however, given 
us the baker's dozen ; and the thirteenth vol- 
ume, bearing the sub-title, " Poetry, Vol. VII.," 
is now before us. This well edited, fully an- 
notated, richly illustrated edition affords both 
excuse and opportunity for taking a new sur- 
vey of Byron, both as man and as poet. The 
six volumes containing the Letters and Jour- 
nals are perhaps the more interesting half of 
the work, not only because Mr. Prothero is a 
sounder editor than is Mr. Coleridge, but also 
and chiefly because of the hundreds of hitherto 
imperfectly printed or wholly uncollected let- 
ters they contain. Here are twelve hundred 
letters (less two), — nearly twice as many as in 
the largest previous collection. These letters, 
with the full annotation and the index pro- 
vided by the editor, together with the numer- 
ous portraits and views, go far to make the 
reader acquainted with the man Byron in his 
habit as he lived. 

The thirteenth and concluding volume con- 
tains " Epigrams and Jeux d' Esprit," — many 
of them hitherto uncollected and some ten 
hitherto unprinted. The frontispiece is a strik- 
ing portrait of Ada Byron, and there are other 
interesting pictures. Much more than half 
(260 pp.) of the volume is devoted to an elab- 
orate " Bibliography of the successive editions 
and translations of Lord Byron's Poetical 
Works." Finally there is an index to the 
poetical works, almost as long (100 pp.) as 
the index to the letters (113 pp.). Thus the 
student is able to look up any note in the thir- 
teen volumes, or any of the multitudinous 
allusions that crowd the pages of this poet. 
The critic notes faults and errors of detail, but 
it must be admitted that this edition is, on the 
whole, very successfully carried to completion. 
Were the editorial shortcomings of Mr. Cole- 
ridge far greater than they are, the edition

would still be beyond comparison the best and 
completest. Such it is likely to remain, per- 
haps, until " the inevitable German " enters 
the field. 

If fame is anything, the Bibliography shows 
that Byron enjoys it beyond any other mod- 
ern poets save Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe. 
" Childe Harold's Pilgrimage " has been trans- 
lated into Armenian, Bohemian, Danish, Hun- 
garian, Swedish ; into Kussian. twice, into 
Polish five times, into Italian eight times, into 
French at least as often, while no fewer than 
eleven different translators have rendered the 
poem into German. The array of translations 
of " Don Juan " is, considering the great length 
of that poem, equally impressive : one into 
Servian, two (complete) into Polish, five or six 
into Russian, and so on. Says Mr. Coleridge 
in the preface : 

" Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken Byron to 
themselves, and have made him their own. No other 
English poet except Shakespeare has been so widely read 
and so frequently translated. Of Manfred I reckon 
one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two Dutch, three 
French, nine German, three Hungarian, three Italian, 
two Polish, one Romaic, one Roumanian, four Russian^ 
and three Spanish translations, and in all probability 
there are others which have escaped my net." 

One cannot, of course, enter here upon an 
analysis of the qualities that have made Byron 
the poet of " Teuton and Latin and Slav," 
rather than of the race from which he sprang, 
whose character he reacted against — and 
shared. This would be the subject of a study 
such as, now that Leslie Stephen has laid down 
the pen forever, perhaps no surviving critic 
has the mental stature to undertake. For there 
is little agreement about the value of Byron's 
poetry. The late Mr. Henley thought Byron 
the master-poet of his time ; on the other 
hand Professor Saintsbury professes to consider 
Byron as not even a very good second-rate 
poet. Some go beyond even Mr. Henley in 
laudation ; and now and then the querulous 
voice of Mr. Swinburne seems to cry in the 
top of Mr. Saintsbury's in disparagement. 
To the last-named critic, however, is reserved 
the distinction of suggesting that the whole 
continent of Europe has been the victim of a 
sort of insanity on the subject of Byron. I 
am not aware that Mr. Saintsbury has ever 
avowed any doubt of his own entire critical 
sanity. The type is well known to alienists. 

What elements of permanence has the fame 
of Byron ? Must he, like the pseudo-Ossian, 
atone for excessive vogue in his own age by 
neglect in all succeeding time ? May he, like 



390 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Ossian, be safely skipped ? Or does the pres- 
ent critical edition, with its apparatus of notes 
and variant readings, point to his ultimate 
assignment to a secure and unchallenged posi- 
tion as a world-poet ? The fact that these are 
still debatable questions is in itself a verdict. 
The memory of man, which " drags at each 
remove a lengthening chain," has already cut 
loose from much of the heated improvisation 
of Byron's facile muse. Students now gravely 
set about reading Byron as so much task- work. 
His brush is found coarse, his scenery spec- 
tacular, his sentiment operatic, his versing 
^slovenly, his satire too often personal and 
spiteful. 

It is pretty obvious that Byron possessed 
more of energy than of philosophy, more wit 
than wisdom. His reader often concludes that 
he had more cleverness than character, — a 
hasty judgment, surely, in the case of a man 
who gave his life for an ideal. " Greater love 
hath no man than this." Even though he failed 
"to see life steadily and see it whole," Byron 
enjoyed clear glimpses. Certain things he saw 
and helped others to see. His proud and com- 
placent country has never forgiven him for 
aying bare to the derision of the nations her 
unseemliness, and has naturally made reprisal 
by laying undue stress upon the poet's literary 
and the man's personal sins. Time was when 
men, educated to look upon Byron as false and 
dangerous, shook out his banner when they 
fancied themselves driven to break with so- 
ciety, — much as in an earlier age one pricked 
a vein and signed an indenture for one's soul. 
When, in a memorable essay, a sound and 
conservative English critic ascribed to Byron 
" the excellence of sincerity and strength," 
and classed him with England's chief literary 
glories alongside of Wordsworth, the gentle 
reader held his breath. That was a number 
of years ago, and we are now getting more 
familiar with the notion. Reviewing "Don 
Juan " to-day, one is struck not only with its 
fresh power, but with the very considerable in- 
sight it displays. Moreover, — so decadent has 
literature grown, — the thing does not appear 
as bad as one had thought, or hoped. Indeed, 
the jaded ear harks back with relief to the 
■clear notes of Byron's horn, now that Carlyle, 
Euskin, Tennyson, Browning, 

" The silenced quire, 
Lie with their hallelujahs quenched like fire." 

This is much, and I think not all. Even after 
Oarlyle, there still remains in " Don Juan " 
a purgative principle that may have some effi- 



cacy in clearing our minds of cant. Does not 
the modern world, straining beneath "the white 
man's burden," afford a subject to the satirist? 
The functions of the literature of our day are, 
so it would seem, to beguile our short leis- 
ures with the short story and our uneasy 
consciences with the sublimities of imperial- 
ism. In a time when the megaphonic voice 
of Kipling is raised only to glorify the subju- 
gation of the weak, may we not sigh for a 
Byron upon the opposition bench ? The satirist 
of Castlereagh and the fat Regent would find, 
were he to revisit the world, abundant mate- 
rials for a continuation of his great poem of 
modern life in such incidents and shibboleths 
as the Yellow Peril, Benevolent Assimilation, 
the March of Civilization, the Boer War, the 
Pacification of the Filipino, the Peace Con- 
gress, the Diplomatic Mission to Tibet, as well 
as in the grand international symphony of 
British Bathos, Russian Pathos, and American 
Cant. That such a satire would do something 
to clear the moral atmosphere of our time, I 
for one cannot doubt. To say this is virtually 
to concede such praise to Byron as would per- 
haps have satisfied even his great hunger for 
fame. Melville B. Anderson. 



A Composite History or the 
Kefokmation.* 



In the preface to the first volume of the 
"Cambridge Modern History," the editors 
stated that the novel feature of Lord Acton's 
scheme lay in the use of specialists, by whom 
the various topics in each chapter of each vol- 
ume were to be treated ; and it was exactly for 
this specialized treatment that students of his- 
tory extended a general welcome in advance 
to the work itself. The first volume, on the 
Renaissance, largely fulfilled the editorial prom- 
ise, while the second in order of publication, on 
the United States, was at least divided among 
a large number of writers, although various 
opinions have been expressed as to the merit 
of their contributions. The third and latest 
volume, on the Reformation, distinctly departs 
from the original plan in that four authors 
have written eleven of the nineteen chapters, 
and while in two instances the chapters may 
be regarded as but formal divisions of a single

topic, in the remaining cases there is no ap- 
parent foundation for any claim to so wide- 
spread a specialized knowledge. Thus Mr. 
A. F. Pollard not only has four consecutive 
chapters dealing respectively with "National 
Opposition to Rome in Germany," " Social 
Revolution and Catholic Reaction in Ger- 
many," " The Conflict of Creeds and Parties 
in Germany," and " Religious War in Ger- 
many," (sufficiently differentiated topics in 
themselves for several writers), but also con- 
tributes a chapter on " The Reformation under 
Edward VI." With the exception of a chapter 
on Luther by the Rev. T. M. Lindsay, the 
reformation movement in Germany is thus 
exclusively the work of Mr. Pollard ; and in 
place of differentiated specialized studies we 
have merely a new general history of the Ger- 
man Reformation by a single author. The 
Rev. W. E. Collins has one chapter on " The 
Catholic South," giving a combined treatment 
of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and another on 
*' The Scandinavian North "; while the Rev. 
A. M. Fairburn writes on " Calvin and the 
Reformed Church," and on " Tendencies 
of European Thought in the Age of the 
Reformation." 

The instances just cited indicate, then, that 
Ihe editors of the " Cambridge Modern His- 
tory " have departed in the present volume 
from their original plan. Either specialized 
knowledge on sub-topics of the reformation 
period is rare in England, or the specialists 
have not been available. This defect is a seri- 
ous one, considering the avowed purpose of 
the work; but in other respects the volume 
is still valuable at least for its combination of 
topics, showing a continuous development, and 
for its readableness. The best chapters are 
those by Mr. Pollard on " Social Revolution 
and Catholic Reaction in Germany," by Mr. 
James Gairdner on Henry VIII., and by the 
Rev. A. M. Fairburn on " Calvin and the 
Reformed Church"; the last-named in partic- 
ular offering an excellent generalization, with 
just enough exact detail to give solidarity, and 
showing much thought and study. Thus two 
at least of the very writers who have unfor- 
tunately been persuaded, or permitted, to un- 
dertake too wide a field, have contributed a 
specialized study in one portion of that field. 
In general a sharp line has been drawn be- 
tween theological and political movements in 
the reformation period, with the result that 
eminent men, like Luther, are frequently de- 
picted in contradictory colors. It is difficult 



to harmonize the Rev. Mr. Lindsay's humble 
and truth-seeking Luther with the man ar- 
raigned by Mr. Pollard, in connection with the 
Peasant Revolt, as " not free from the upstart's 
contempt for the class from which he sprang"; 
and several diverse opinions are expressed in 
as many chapters of Luther's intellectual qual- 
ities. These, however, being matters of inter- 
pretation, rather add interest to the volume as 
a whole, and do not involve any marked dis- 
agreement as to historical facts. The service- 
ableness of the work for convenient reference 
is continued by the orderly arrangement of 
bibliographies into sections covering respec- 
tively documents, other sources, and secondary 
works ; by the comprehensive index ; and by a 
chronological table, including the years 1608 
to 1564. In general, then, the estimate here 
placed on this volume, is that while distinctly 
inferior to the first volume in one important 
feature, it is still valuable as a work both to 
be read and referred to by the general histor- 
ical student. It is to be hoped that future vol- 
umes will return to the higher standard set in 
the beginning. ^^ ^^ ^^^^^ 



Some Recent Railway IjIteratube.* 

Twenty years ago any orderly discussion of 
railway management or railway economics was 
as " caviare to the general." There had been 
a period of railway pioneering — which was 
closed in 1869 with the completion of the trans- 
continental route — when the roads were not 
only popular, but were solicited to enter in and 
occupy. Any discussion that became public 
was concerned, not with principles and scien- 
tific laws, but with material ways and means. 
Then came a sudden awakening to the arbitrary 
and inequitable methods employed by these com- 
mon carriers, and for a few years the country 
was afflicted with a spasm of " granger " legis- 
lation. But this method defeated its own ends, 
and statutes were either repealed or became a 
dead letter. Then a period of state commis- 
sions succeeded, — some advisory, on the basis

of the admirable Massachusetts experiment, 
but most of them " with power." Taking this 
method of control " by and large," the rail- 
road managers were restricted and exasperated 
unduly, and the shipping and travelling public 
were but little benefitted. Yet one great good 
was accomplished, - — the public was being edu- 
cated into an enlightened interest in railway 
problems, and railway men were being forced 
into an intelligent recognition of public opinion. 

The growth of the country in the decade 
following the Civil War — a growth that the 
railways made possible — was along the lines 
of the national sentiment which the war had 
so intensified. Soon it was seen that the rail- 
way problem was one beyond the bounds of 
states and the mastery of state legislation 
and state commissions. In the height of the 
" granger " controversy, agitation began for 
some method of federal regulation. In 1872 
President Grant brought the matter to the 
attention of Congress, and through a series of 
efforts, marked by the Windom report, the 
McCreary and Eeagan bills, and the Cullom 
report, that body came in 1887 to the adop- 
tion of the Interstate Commerce Act. The 
general public breathed a sigh of relief, feel- 
ing that its troubles with the roads were ended, 
when in truth they were but entering upon a 
larger and more intricate experience. 

However, the railway had finally taken hold 
on popular imagination. A great literature 
concerning it arose. Not only were the pages 
of such journals as "The Nation," "The 
North American Review," and " The Forum " 
crowded with valuable discussions of railway 
matters, but a large number of books was de- 
voted to the subject. Even a considerable 
body of fiction has made this its field, includ- 
ing one of the most powerful novels of the 
close of the century. This literature is the 
product of the last twenty-five years, and in a 
large degree of the last fifteen. The pioneer 
work — which is still a classic, for breadth of 
view and scientific insight, — is "Railroads, 
their Origin and Problems," published by 
Charles Francis Adams, Jr., in 1878. This 
was followed in 1885 by President Hadley's 
" Railroad Transportation, its History and its 
Laws." So the path was blazed, and the mag- 
nificent railway library at Stanford University, 
with its thousands of critical treatises, its scores 
of railway periodicals, in several languages, 
and its great mass of reports and decisions, 
bears witness to the literary and critical in- 
terest that has been created. In 1902 Mr. 



Harriman had an hour to give to Stanford, 
and when his cicerone had piloted him into 
this library, he left it only to catch the train. 

The three books named at the head of this 
article are reliable works. Professor Johnson 
has covered the ground as no one before him has 
done, under the larger titles of the system, the 
service, the public, the state. Under the third 
title is an admirable discussion of competition, 
rates, pools, traffic associations, and monopoly. 
Under the last title is a good presentation of 
the independent system of Great Britain, and 
the state-aided systems of the continent ; as 
also of regulation in the United States by 
state governments, the Interstate Commission, 
and, finally, by the courts. This last phase of 
control lacks but the recent Northern Securi- 
ties decision to bring the subject to the present 
moment. In its resume, however, it is as re- 
cent as the Elkins law of February 17, 1903, 
and contributes a valuable critique on the 
Trans-Missouri and other decisions that have 
extended, so unexpectedly, the anti-trust law 
of 1890 to the railways. Another chapter dis- 
cusses railway taxation, and the final chapter 
on " the problem of government regulation " 
decides for improvement in " the methods and 
agencies of regulation now employed rather 
than to attempt the enormous task of purchas- 
ing and operating two-fifths of the railway 
mileage of the world." 

The greater part of the material contained 
in Mr. Pratt's volume was published in a 
series of letters to " The Times " of London in 
the first half of 1903, Mr. Pratt having spent 
four months in travel over nine thousand miles 
of American railway. The author, as a rail- 
way writer of long experience, is thoroughly 
conversant with his subject, and has a happy 
faculty of seeing and reporting things of prime 
importance. He has also a sane and tolerant 
judgment, and consequently has made a book 
that is both valuable and fascinating. It bids 
fair to take the same rank among British re- 
ports as do Mr. Bryce's " American Common- 
wealth" and the Moseley industrial and edu- 
cational reports. He is " to our virtues always 
kind," and yet sees no reason to disparage the 
good things in the English system for the sake 
of exploiting ours. Especially valuable in 
this respect is the chapter entitled " Some 
Points of Difference." Track elevation at 
Chicago has a chapter, the Pittsburg Block 
another. The whole thing is admirable, but 
especially so are the brief topics discussed 
under " Miscellaneous," including signalling.

the capture of the small shareholder, the sub- 
urban traffic problem at Chicago, luggage and 
parcels, the policy of combination, and ton- 
mileage statistics. 

Professor Meyer's little book is not so much 
for the million as are the two volumes just 
noticed. But Professor Meyer has already 
become an authority on the special subject of 
which he treats, and the special student of rail- 
way problems will welcome his contribution. A 
portion of it has already been given to scholars 
in the pages of " The Political Science Quar- 
terly" and the "Annals of the Academy of 
Political and Social Science." The aim is 
*' to present a condensed analysis of the pri- 
vate and public laws which govern railways in 
the United States, and of the important de- 
cisions relating to interstate commerce. State- 
ments and comments are based upon actual 
analysis and in large part upon analytical 
tables of charters and laws enacted in the 
various states." Whilst the body of the work 
is so made up, the author has rendered as im- 
portant a service in his own criticism, embodied 
in chapters on characteristics of legislation, for- 
eign side-lights, economic adjustments, leading 
principles of the decisions of the commissioners, 
commission, and courts, and the Cullom bill. 
For class-room work this volume is a happy 
complement to Professor Johnson's.

The IjAird of IjI ttleg range.* 

When Fanny Kemble was contributing her 
vivacious reminiscences to " The Atlantic 
Monthly," a quarter-century or more ago, she 
found occasion to say a few proper words of 
praise for her friend Edward FitzGerald, 
whose genius she had been one of the first to 
appreciate. But the tribute, modest and de- 
served as it was, met with such pained remon- 
strance from its recipient, that at his request 
it was excised when the writer came to revise 
her work for publication in book form. Says 
Mrs. Kemble : 

" He did not certainly knock me on the head with 
Dr. Johnson's sledge-hammer, but he did make me feel 
painfully that I had been guilty of the impertinence 
of praising." 

Meanwhile FitzGerald had bound up the maga- 
zine articles, and was lending the improvised 
volume to a few of his friends. One of these,

Wright. In two yolumes. Illustrated. New York : Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 



in returning the book, complained of a strange 
lacuna therein, caused by the pasting of blank 
paper over some of the pages. It was in this 
manner that FitzGerald had obliterated the 
passage referring to himself. 

That such a man, one who could not bear to be 
talked about even among his intimate friends, 
should be made the subject of a ponderous 
biography is a destiny indeed ironic ; the more 
so as the task was wholly needless. As was 
proved by Mr. John Glyde's innocuous effort 
of a few years ago, there is nothing essential 
in the story of FitzGerald's peaceful life that 
does not find place in Mr. Aldis Wright's edi- 
tion of the Letters. These volumes, eked out 
with glimpses afforded in the memorabilia of a 
few judicious friends, reveal the man so lumin- 
ously that a formal biography is as superfluous 
as would be a botanical analysis of our favorite 
nook of woodland. But the Omar cult is still 
inquisitive, and " old Fitz " must needs take 
his turn with the all-devouring biographer. 

A life more devoid of moving incident, more 
tranquil and sequestered in its outer aspects, 
would be difficult to imagine. So trivial even 
to himself seemed the details of his " innocent 
far-niente existence " that he never touched 
upon them in his letters without quaintly apol- 
ogizing. A pious pilgrimage to Scott's haunts 
at Abbotsford, a visit to Ireland, a yachting 
cruise to Holland, — these were the largest 
happenings of his life. In summer he was a 
great deal upon or near the ocean, which always 
held first place in his affections ; and now 
and then there would be an unwilling journey 
to London, or a renewal of the old college 
associations at Cambridge. But for the most 
part, the years were merged in a quiet pastoral 
of Suffolk lane and garden. 

" You know my way of life so well that I need not 
describe it to you, as it has undergone no change 
since I saw you. I read of mornings; the same old 
books over and over again, having no command of new 
ones: walk with my great black dog of an afternoon, 
and at evening sit with open windows, up to which China 
roses climb, with my pipe, while the blackbirds and 
thrushes begin to rustle bedwards in the garden, and 
the nightingale to have the neighbourhood to herself." 
And again : 

"A little Bedfordshire — a little Northamptonshire — 
a little more folding of the hands — the same faces — 
the same fields — the same thoughts occurring at the 
same turns of road — this is all I have to tell of; 
nothing at all added — but the summer gone." 

Epics and two-volume biographies are not 
made from such stuff as this.

the spirit and manner of its subject, we might 
partially forgive its lack of raison d'etre. But 
the genial and delicate charm of the Wood- 
bridge philosopher finds no echo here. As a 
biography, the book is formless and unillumin- 
ating ; the style is devoid of literary grace, and 
not seldom lacking in taste. The author's 
judgments are often rash, and his deductions 
naive. He has evidently been untiring in his 
search for material ; but the results of this 
labor are singularly unimportant. We are told 
a great deal about FitzGerald's neighbors, his 
brother and his brother's servants, — in all of 
whom we confess only a faint interest ; but to 
the existing portrait of the Laird of Little- 
grange nothing essential is added. The Lowe- 
stoft captain, Fletcher (the often-mentioned 
" Posh " of the Letters), and Mary Lynn, 
playmate of FitzGerald's childhood, have been 
drawn upon at some length, but offer little to 
the point. We are able to gather, however, 
that " Posh," whom FitzGerald included with 
Tennyson and Thackeray as the three greatest 
men he had ever known, seems to have been 
rather unappreciative of his admirer's real 
quality. 

In Mr. Wright's preface there are promises 
of " important revelations," dark allusions to 
"unsuspected connections," and a dramatic 
assertion that the writer has " laid bare the 
whole story " of " the great central circum- 
stance of FitzGerald's life." We can find 
little in the body of the book to warrant these 
prophecies. An example of the " revelations " 
is presented in the author's statement, unsup- 
ported by other authority, that FitzGerald was 
for a time " deeply in love " with a grand- 
daughter of the poet Crabbe. This may or 
may not be true ; as given here it is no more 
than an interesting surmise. " The great cen- 
tral circumstance of FitzGerald's life," accord- 
ing to Mr. Wright, was his friendship for W. 
Kenworthy Browne. This he characterizes as 
" one of the most remarkable friendships in 
literary history," adding further that "to Fitz- 
Gerald, Browne was at once Gamaliel, Jona- 
than, Apollo : the friend, the master, the god — 
and literary history offers no parallel to the 
conjuncture." Every reader of the Letters 
who recalls that poignant account of Fitz- 
Gerald's visit to the dying Browne will know 
how strong was the attachment between these 
two. Yet it was FitzGerald's great privilege 
that several such enduring attachments were 
his, — all his friendships, as he has told us, 
were " more like loves "; and in this light 



Mr. Wright's theory seems fanciful and his 
superlatives remain unconvincing. 

In an appendix to his biography, Mr. Wright 
presents with due flourish some " hitherto un- 
published " writings of FitzGerald, consisting 
in the main of two poems rescued from con- 
temporary "Keepsakes," and a series of "word 
portraits " of Thackeray, Tennyson, Bernard 
Barton, and others, found in one of Fitz- 
Gerald's copy-books. So feeble and unworthy 
are these compositions that Mr. Aldis Wright's 
recent communication in " The AthenaBum " 
was hardly needed to convince the discerning 
that they were not authentic. The verses were 
written by the obnoxious individual, a prede- 
cessor of FitzGerald at Cambridge, whose sim- 
ilarity of name was ever a thorn in the poet's 
side. The " word portraits " were the work of 
a London " graphologist," and had merely been 
transcribed by FitzGerald. 

While Mr. Wright presents a fuller account 
than has before been available of FitzGerald's 
unfortunate marriage, we are grateful that he 
treats the subject with somewhat more than his 
usual discretion. It was a pitiable affair from 
any point of view, yet the issue was inevitable, 
and no trace of discredit may be attached to 
either of the two concerned. In the matter of 
religion, it would seem that Mr. Wright is not 
wholly in accord with the poet who has given 
us what has been called the highest expression 
of Agnosticism. He stamps with disapproval 
the reply of FitzGerald to the Woodbridge 
parson who called to express regret that he 
was never seen at church, — 

" Sir, you might have conceived that a man has not 
come to my years of life without thinking much of 
these things. I believe I may say that I have reflected 
on them fully as much as yourself. You need not re- 
peat this visit." 

A very proper answer ! And yet that Fitz- 
Gerald's was a deeply reverent spirit what 
reader of discernment can doubt ? " It is He 
that hath made us, and not we ourselves," -— 
no mere scoffer would have chosen such an in- 
scription to stand above his own grave. 

A number of entertaining anecdotes enliven 
Mr. Wright's pages, and the numerous illus- 
trations (most of them new) form a feature 
of much interest. But at the end we lay aside 
the two bulky volumes, and turn again to the 
Letters, with much the same feeling that Fitz- 
Gerald must have experienced in escaping from 
the noisy futilities of London to the peace and 
fragrance of his own Woodbridge garden. And 
in so doing we realize anew how slight is the

need for any other biography of FitzGerald than 
the one he has himself given us. Not in minute 
descriptions of his homes and friends and serv- 
ants, but in such a glimpse as this, is the living 
man to be discerned : 

"Here is a glorious sunshiny day: all the morning 
I read about Nero in Tacitus lying at full length on a 
bench in the garden: a nightingale singing, and some 
red anemones eyeing the sun manfully not far o&. A 
funny mixture all this: Nero, and the delicacy of 
Spring: all very human however. Then at half-past 
one lunch on Cambridge cream cheese: then a ride 
over hill and dale: then spudding up some weeds from 
the grass: and then coming in, I sit down to write to 
you, my sister winding red worsted from the back of a 
chair, and the most delightful little girl in the world 
chattering incessantly. So runs the world away. You 
think I live in Epicurean ease: but this happens to be 
a jolly day: one isn't always well, or tolerably good, 
the weather is not always clear, nor nightingales sing- 
ing, nor Tacitus full of pleasant atrocity."

Some New Theories or the Earth.* 



Since the days when James II. commended 
to his faithful subjects Burnett's " Telluris 
Theoria Sacra," geologists have been busy 
with book- making. It is an intellectual eon, 
however, from the quaint imaginings of the 
close of the seventeeth century to the orderly 
presentation of a fully developed science in 
these early years of the twentieth. In the 
interim there has been many a treatise, each 
showing some advance in the science. Of these, 
Lyell's "Principles of Geology," published 
early in the nineteenth century, forms the nat- 
ural starting-point for English students. 

In America we have had two notable and 
comprehensive summaries of the science of 
geology, — that of Dana, first published in 1862, 
and that of Le Conte, in 1877. Both were of 
first importance, and have profoundly influ- 
enced the thought of American scientists. To 
these two there is now added a third work, 
which it may be safely predicted will influence 
the larger audience of the present quite as 
fundamentally. Dana's text-book was first of 
all a stratigrapher's book, and was essentially 
concerned with results. Le Conte's was a phi- 
losopher's book, — a philosopher in love with 
the doctrine of evolution. The Chamberlin- 
Salisbury text-book is something of each of 
these, but is before all else a teacher's book, 

* Geology. By Thomas A. Chamberlin and Rollin D. 
Salisbury. Volume I., Geologic Processes and their Besults. 
Illustrated. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



and is concerned equally with results and pro- 
cesses. 

The belief has long been firmly, if some- 
times sub-consciously, held that nothing is fit 
matter for text-book use until it has been so 
thoroughly tested and proved that it is dead 
and lifeless, — till it has lost that element of 
novelty which contributes so largely to its 
interest. Yet all great text-books have disre- 
garded this belief, and have set new stakes to 
which the plodders of the profession should 
advance. The present work is not only no 
exception to this rule, but is a striking expo- 
nent of it ; and to the general reader the book 
will have its chief interest in this phase of 
the discussion, — the unique hypotheses here 
presented. 

It will doubtless come as a shock to many 
to find the long-accepted Nebular Hypothesis 
not only here questioned, but confronted with 
a fully developed alternative, — the planetismal 
theory. In the second volume, still in press, 
the full statement of this hypothesis is to be 
set forth ; but in the pages of the present vol- 
ume it is given in outline and many of its 
applications are made. The new point of view 
leads to many novel conceptions : there may 
never have been a liquid earth ; there is prac- 
tically no limit to the time the earth may have 
been inhabited ; past climates have been func- 
tions of the constitution of the atmosphere, 
and glacial and inter-glacial periods come and 
go as the air is poor or rich in carbon-dioxide ; 
the crumpling which produces mountains is the 
expression of locally accumulated horizontal 
stresses, while the big dominant movements of 
the earth have been vertical, and it is to them 
that appeal must be made for the criteria upon 
which world-wide correlations are to be based. 
These and many other changes must be made 
in current doctrine if the new hypothesis prove 
correct. In this work, both new and old theo- 
ries are stated side by side, and in comparing 
them the student enters at once into the circle 
of working geologists. He is trained in mak- 
ing discriminations, instead of being presented 
with neat packages of pre-digested food. 

The book is excellently printed, despite cer- 
tain minor imperfections. The margins are 
narrow, and there are the annoying errors in 
footnotes and in text incident to first editions. 
The illustrations, while lavish and well-chosen, 
are not always sufficiently described in caption. 
Yet on the whole the work is worthily pre- 
sented, and is as notable in appearance as in 
subject-matter. H. Foster Bain.

Books on Music and Musicians.* 



The second volume of the " History of American 
Art," a series of books published under the editorial 
supervision of Mr. John C. Van Dyke, is devoted 
to American Music, and is the work of the compe- 
tent historian and critic, Mr. Louis C Elson. The 
idea of this series is to have each branch of art 
handled by a recognized authority on the subject, 
and by one who practices the craft whereof he 
writes, — the whole to comprise a complete history 
of artistic development in America from colonial 
times to the year 1904. The first volume, " The 
History of American Sculpture," by Mr. Lorado 
Taft, has already been reviewed in these columns ; 
and the present work sustains the standard set by 
Mr. Taft. 

In " The History of American Music," the author 
has told of the beginnings, the foreign influences, 
the changes, the methods that have gone to the 
making of our national music, not only having in 
mind the question of its development, but the man- 
ner in which that development has been affected 
by persons, events, and compositions. He points 
out that in presenting such a history one ought, if 
following chronological sequence, to speak first of 
the songs of the Aborigines ; but while these are 
the earliest melodies that can be traced on this con- 
tinent, the music of the North American Indians 
is responsible for very little of the composition of 
later times. " The true beginnings of American 
music — seeds that finally grew into a harvest of 
native compositions — must be sought in a field 
almost as unpromising as that of Indian music 
itself, — the rigid, narrow, and often commonplace 
psalm-singing of New England." Mr. Elson lays 
stress on the fact that it was the music developed 
in Puritan Boston and in Pilgrim Plymouth which, 
although it had its origin over seas, soon became 
indigenous to the soil, and changed gradually from 
the style of its prototype, as in the Middle Ages 
the Gregorian chant changed in France and became 
the Cantus Gallicanus. The account of the relig- 
ious origin of American music is full of interest, 
and is illustrated with reproductions of quaint scores 
of early psalmody. 

The first of our native composers was William 
Billings, who was born in Boston in 1746. In his 
time, the chief music in New York was found in 
the Episcopal churches, and Trinity Church upheld 
something of the dignity of the English cathedral

music within its walls. During the next fifty years 
musical societies contributed largely to the progress 
of the art, which was augmented when Lowell 
Mason, " the father of American church music," 
became president of the Handel and Haydn Society 
at Boston, in 1827. In the seventeenth and eight- 
eenth centuries instrumental music was by no means 
as common as vocal music. In orchestral work up 
to 1860, there was more of ambition than of true 
achievement. Gottlieb Graupner (who came to 
Boston in 1798) is spoken of as the father of 
American orchestral music ; yet the present chroni- 
cler says this is true only in a chronological sense, 
and that as regards the establishment of a high 
standard of execution and the introduction of a 
true epoch of interpretation Mr. Theodore Thomas 
deserves this honorable title. He and Dr. William 
Mason, leader in early piano music, are credited 
with giving greater catholicity to the concert reper- 
toire. Wilhelm Gericke, Arthur Nikisch, Emil 
Paur, Walter Damrosch, Fritz Scheel, and Victor 
Herbert have also had much to do with keeping 
America abreast of Europe in the field of orchestra 
magic — " one of the brightest spots on the musical 
horizon in this country at present." 

The story of opera in America opens with a pro- 
duction of " The Beggar's Opera " in New York 
as early as 1750. To New Orleans belongs the 
credit of introducing operas of the French and 
Italian schools in this country. It is difficult to 
trace the inception of native opera. Mr. Elson 
mentions "Leonora," by William H. Fry, as the 
first American opera of any musical worth; this 
was followed by " Rip Van Winkle " by Bristow, 
" The Scarlet Letter " by Damrosch, and " Alzara " 
by Paine. The course of the opera is minutely 
traced up to the time when Colonel Mapleson was 
called from Her Majesty's Theater in London to 
save the waning glories of the Academy of Music 
in New York, during the career of Anton Seidl as 
a director, under the Grau regime, up to the advent 
of H. Conreid as manager of the Metropolitan and 
the representation of " Parsifal " on Christmas Eve, 
1903, — which he considers one of the epoch-mak- 
ing events in the history of music in this country, 
and perhaps even of international importance. 

Folk-music is traced from the days of the Ojib- 
ways, Omahas, and Apaches, to the unhappy career 
of Stephen C Foster. After recording the history 
of national and patriotic music, the author says : 
" It is very probable that the giant strides made in 
composition in this country may very soon result 
in some other national song replacing those de- 
scribed. Among the many composers who are now 
creating a repertoire of important works in America, 
there must be one who will some day feel impelled 
to write us a true national anthem." 

In selecting five names as the chief composers of 
America, the author points out that four of the five 
have also been important factors in public musical 
instruction, — Mr. Paine being at the head of mu- 
sical training at Harvard, Mr. Chadwick at the 



1904.]

New England Conservatory of Music, Mr. Parker 
at Yale, and Mr. MacDowell at Columbia; while 
the fifth naan, Mr. Arthur Foote, has thus far em- 
ployed his abilities as a teacher only in a private 
capacity. 

In the chapters devoted to orchestral composers, 
the author writes with thoroughness and sincerity. 
His experience as a teacher and director enables 
him to touch upon many works in manuscript form 
in a familiar manner. " So long as we have a pub- 
lic not fully acquainted with the orchestral works 
of the great masters this (MS. form) must neces- 
sarily be the fate of the mass of American com- 
posers. But that acquaintance is being speedily 
made ; and we may hope that in the near future, 
instead of unnecessary repetitions of standard works 
or interpretations of the efforts of untried European 
fledglings, there will be a constant demand for 
worthy compositions of American musicians, lead- 
ing to their publication as well as their perform- 
ance." 

In speaking of a figure essentially American — 
one who has probably had more performances of 
his works in France and Germany and England 
than all other native composers, — he recalls the 
fable of the bat among the birds and mice : " The 
birds declined to associate with it because it was 
too much like a mouse ; the mice declined its com- 
panionship because it too closely resembled a bird. 
Some such dilemma confronts one in the classifica- 
tion of John Philip Sousa. In Germany they hold 
his music so typically representative of America 
that they play his marches on international occa- 
sions, as, for example, the festivities connected with 
the Wagner monument in Berlin. In America his 
tunes are familiar to all classes, and many a musi- 
cian who knows that Sousa does not belong among 
the great masters might be obliged to confess 
greater familiarity vrith the melodies of the former 
than with some of the themes of the latter. ... To 
write stirring rhythms, melodies that one cannot 
shake out of one's memory, tunes that make the 
tired soldier walk and the popular concert audience 
tap their feet, is not given to everyone. America 
may accept Sousa's remarkable capture of Europe 
with pleasure, without unduly exalting it." 

Opei'atic, cantata, and song composers are com- 
prehensively mentioned. Speaking of the late 
Ethelbert W. Nevin, the author says that one can 
pay tribute to him as being one of the most poetic 
of American composers, and that to him might be 
applied the epitaph which Grillparzer wrote for 
Schubert : 

" Fate buried here a rich possession, 
But yet greater promise." 

Regarding the question as to whether a woman 
can become a great composer, — whether there 
will ever be a female Beethoven or Mozart, — Mr. 
Elson says : " In Europe most authorities have an- 
swered the question in the negative. Carl Rein- 
ecke, long director of the Leipsig Conservatory, 
once gave his views on this subject to the present 



writer. He believed that there was a point where 
women stopped in music. His experience was that, 
up to a well-advanced point in the intepretation of 
the ideas of others, the female student often out- 
stripped the male ; but in the highest realms of 
musical performance, where individuality needed 
to be blended with the text of the composer, there 
was a timidity that militated against progress. In 
the purely creative field he found scarcely any prog- 
ress comparable to that of the intelligent poetic 
male student. Svendsen in Norway, and Gade in 
the Conservatory of Copenhagen, long ago expressed 
almost identical views." Ambroise Thomas once said 
to us : '' Your country seems to be the natural home 
of the soprano ! " America has given more promi- 
nent operatic sopranos to the world than it has of 
pianists, organists, or violinists. Mr. Elson suggests 
that it may be climate, it maybe food, or it may be 
heredity, that causes northern Spain to bring forth 
tenors ; Switzerland, male falsetto singers ; England, 
contraltos ; Russia, bases ; and America, sopranos. 

After taking up the question of musical criticism 
and authorship, the writer closes his work with 
chapters on " The Musical Education of the Pres- 
ent" and "Qualities and Defects of American 
Music." He points out that while this country 
does not possess, and does not require, an endowed 
school of music under government protection, such 
as the Conservatoire at Paris or some of the con- 
servatories in Italy, Belgium, or Germany, yet, 
through the philanthropy and the love of art of 
private individuals, large schools have been founded 
that have carried on the movement inaugurated in 
the Boston Academy of Music, and by Lowell 
Mason, over sixty years ago. " The Americans," 
he says, " may not be as musically gifted as the 
Italians, French, or Germans, but in the widespread 
study of the art, in great popular interest, in public 
festivals, the United States is abreast of some of 
the most cultivated European nations. It must be 
confessed, however, that in thoroughness of study, 
in the art of making haste slowly, and in the estab- 
lishment of concerted music in the home (probably 
the greatest factor in Germany's musical greatness), 
the impatient energetic American has yet much to 
learn." 

Mr. Elson's work gives us a fair statement of 
what has been accomplished in music in America. 
Judging by a retrospect of fifty years of musical 
endeavor, he considers the future full of promise. 
It is not hard to see that his work is that of a 
student as well as a practical musician. The vol- 
ume contains numerous photogravures and textual 
illustrations, and a good general bibliography, with 
an index. 

The name of James Huneker is justly conspic- 
uous in the field of musical literature and criticism 
in this country ; but by nothing has he deserved his 
distinction more than by his latest volume, *' Over- 
tones : A Book of Temperaments." It is a gal- 
lery of interesting portraits ; and the subjects are

chosen with such regard for variety as to show 
the extent and quality of the author's studies and 
sympathies. We have previously referred to Mr. 
Huneker's peculiar power of analysis, his well- 
balanced discrimination — eulogistic without ex- 
travagance and critical without bitterness. The 
volume opens with an appreciative estimate of 
Richard Strauss. Though shaded here and there 
with highly-colored rhetoric, it is written in the 
easy manner which betokens an affectionate ac- 
quaintance with the classic in music. During 
the present period of worship at the shrine of 
" Parsifal," he challenges the accusation of artistic 
irreverence by plain statement : " It behooves us 
to study Parsifal for ourselves, and not accept as 
gospel the uncritical enthusiasms of the Wagnerite 
who is without a sense of the eternal fitness of 
things. One ounce of humor, of common-sense, 
puts to flight the sham ethical and sham sesthetical 
of the Parsifal worshippers. . . . The composition 
is a miracle of polyphonic architecture — and it is 
also the weakest that its creator ever planned." 
Other chapters of the volume are devoted to 
*' Nietzsche the Rhapsodist," " Anarchs of Art," 
"Literary Men Who Loved Music," "Flaubert 
and his Art," etc. Someone has said that it is 
hard to sketch character without flippancy ; but in 
this study of temperaments the author has shown 
not only originality, but also a comprehensive un- 
derstanding of the art of music. 

" The Act of Touch," by Tobias Matthay, is an 
analysis and synthesis of pianoforte tone production. 
The work is divided into four parts. The first deals 
with the problem of pianoforte training, education 
in the art of tone production, muscular education, 
and the union of execution with conception ; the sec- 
ond part treats of the use of keys from their instru- 
mental aspect, touching upon choice of instrument, 
tone-exciters in the construction of the instrument ; 
the quality of sound, and the fallacy of key-hitting 
or striking ; in the third part, muscular discrimina- 
tion is proved to be urgent, and such questions as 
exaggerated finger lifting, arm-weight and correct 
finger technique are considered ; the fourth part is 
devoted to the aspects and details of position, with 
a glossary and summary of the main teachings of 
the work. As a technical work for teachers and 
advanced musicians, as well as for beginners who 
are in sympathy with the theories outlined, it will 
prove interesting and instructive reading. 

Miss Rosa Newmarch's biography of Henry J. 
Wood is the initial volume in the series of "Living 
Masters of Music" — a series of monographs deal- 
ing with contemporary musical life, intended to 
furnish biographical studies of well-known repre- 
sentatives of all branches of the art, in which the 
aim of supplying full critical and expository com- 
ments is kept steadily in view. Henry J. Wood, 
during his career as an orchestral conductor, has 
become the central figure in English musical life. 
Though born in Newman Street, London (March 
3, 1870), he is, in external appearance, more Sla- 



vonic than English. And, in fact, an interesting 
feature of his work is the way in which he has assimi- 
lated the Slavonic spirit in music, and given to the 
compositions of the New Russian School interpreta- 
tions which breathe the very atmosphere of na- 
tionality ; in the comprehension of the " emotional 
realism " which lies at the heart of all Russian art 
and literature, he is as Russian as the Russians 
themselves. The present monograph is character- 
ized by the analytical ability which was noticeable 
in the same author's "Tchaikovsky," and it is per- 
haps to be expected that she should fall under the 
spell of the personality of her subject, and that 
what she has written should savor, to a certain 
extent, of hero-worship. 

In his biography of Chopin, Mr. J. Cuthbert 
Hadden has told the story of the musician's life^ 
simply, directly, and with a regard for facts. He 
has penned a picture of the man with the same 
power of analysis which appeared in Mr. Jame» 
Huneker's work on the same subject ; and has dis- 
cussed the composer "without trenching on the 
ground of the formalist." The volume is illus- 
trated, and appears in " The Master Musicians " 
series. 

To trace the history of the organ, from the me- 
chanically blown trumpet of Ctesibius of Alexan- 
dria, from documentary evidence apart from the 
vague speculations of Kircher and others, required 
painstaking labor. In "The Story of the Organ," 
Mr. C. F. Abdy Williams has given all the informa- 
tion that is really authentic, and rejected some that 
has heretofore been incorporated in similar sketches, 
but which the present historian regards as apoc- 
ryphal. The numerous illustrations and the elabo- 
rate appendix will be found invaluable to anyone 
directly or indirectly interested in the subject.

of Shakespeare in being "overwhelmingly Ovidian " 
in its mythology. " Shakespeare's Love's Labour's 
Won " is a full and valuable account of the debate 
concerning the identity of the mysterious play 
mentioned in the " Palladis Tamia," leading to 
the discreet conclusion of Professor Wendell that 
"the question can never be definitely settled." 
Two briefer studies, "Hamlet's 'Woo't Drink Up 
Eisel?'" and "Shakespeare's Stage and Modern 
Adaptations," are of much interest ; a more elabo- 
rate series of " Studies in Macbeth," with the excep- 
tion of the sections devoted to the Weird Sisters, 
reminds us rather sharply of the sentimental pitfalls 
that the sanest Shakespearian commentator seldom 
wholly escapes. A suggestive essay on " The 
Symbolic Value of English Sounds," a plea for 
" Natural Science in a Literary Education," and a 
careful but uninspired study of "The Style of 
Anglo Saxon Poetry," are the best of the remaining 
papers. It is difficult to see why the notes on 
Lanier, Poe, and English Surnames should have 
been included in the collection. The tone of the 
Shakespearian essays is refreshingly sober. There 
is little of the fanciful over-subtlety, the solemn 
abdication of common-sense, to which we are ac- 
customed in critics who honor the poet's memory 
on the other side of idolatry. But we think that 
Professor Tolman's sobriety forsakes him when he 
separates the Ghost's mandate, "Taint not thy 
mind," from the following, " Nor contrive against 
thy mother aught," and concedes the possibility of 
the former referring to a conscientious scruple 
against murder. It seems clear that Shakespeare 
accepted the " ethical presuppositions " of the old 
revenge-play, and expected his audience to do the 
same ; he was then prepared to motive the action 
according to the strictest laws of moral probability. 
In this he merely followed a custom as old as the 
(Edipus Bex. Again, the "instinctive poetry" of 
Macbeth's speeches is, we think, over-emphasized as 
a key to his character. Pater's remark is in point : 
" One gracious prerogative, certainly, Shakespeare's 
English kings possess: they are a very eloquent 
company." It is hardly a distinction among Shake- 
speare's heroes to speak exquisite poetry. The 
series of parallels (pp. 232, 233) that help to 
authenticate the Induction to " The Shrew " would 
be " deadly " in a sense not intended by the 
proverb, — deadly to the cause they are meant to 
aid, — were it not buttressed by firmer supports 
than they. We fail to see why it is more absurd 
to suppose that Shakespeare would adopt " minute 
and unimportant phrases " from an old play than 
that he would adopt them from an old Chronicle, 
which he notably did in the trial scene in " Henry 
VIII." A few details call for remark. The state- 
ment (p. 321) that "the syllable -ing was the Anglo- 
Saxon patronymic suffix, meaning son of, and then 
descendant of," demands qualification. In these 
days of Biblical ignorance, it is hardly safe to 
refer calmly to "the other name of the Baptist, 
Elias." Hfinferth (p. 374) does not need the cir- 



cumflex. Finally, it seems to us rather a pity that 
English scholars should retain that comparative 
neologism, Anglo-Saxon, as applied to a language 
that was uniformly called English by those who 
spoke it. The book has no index. 

"The House of Quiet: An Autobi- 
the7hu{-ui ography, edited by J. T." (Button) 

belongs to that numerous class of 
books written in the first person and edited by an 
ostensible third person, but of course not expecting 
to deceive anyone by the transparent artifice. The 
writer, a recluse and an almost lifelong invalid — 
or, at least, for literary purposes we may so con- 
sider him — tells a story of the inner life which 
bears the unmistakable marks of sincerity that 
always command respectful attention. Omitting 
certain irrelevant matters of family history, and 
sundry descriptions (when will authors learn to 
leave landscapes to their brothers of the brush and 
palette?), the book, despite an occasional indul- 
gence in obvious reflections, is well worth reading. 
The writer's early difficulty in reconciling the de- 
terminism to which the intellect is forced to assent 
with the free-will which the whole moral and spir- 
itual nature so strenuously asserts, represents an 
experience that all really thoughtful persons have 
to go through sooner or later. To be sure, the de- 
sired reconciliation is never effected, but we learn 
to content ourselves with Robertson's creed, — 
" that truth is made up of two opposite propositions, 
and not found in a via media between the two." 
As a sample of the wit and wisdom to be found 
in these quiet pages, let us take the " vicious cir- 
cle " of petty duties that fill the lives of most of us. 
" ' What are these fields for ? ' said a squire who had 
lately succeeded to an estate, as he walked round 
with the bailiff. ' To grow oats, sir.' ' And what da 
you do with the oats ? ' ' Feed the horses, sir.' ' And 
what do you want the horses for ? ' 'To plough 
the fields, sir.' " Like Mark Pattison, who wrote 
of a certain period of his life that his ideal was then 
" defiled and polluted by literary ambition," our 
author holds that spiritual peace demands the sacri- 
fice of that and all other selfish ambitions. " Not 
until a man can pass by the rewards of fame oculis 
irretortis — 'nor cast one longing, lingering look 
behind ' — is the victory won." It would be cruel 
and unfair to use the author's own words, as applied 
to an earlier production of his, and call his book 
" sauce without meat "; but should any reader find 
it richer in sauce than in meat, he must at least 
admit the excellence of the sauce.

It is nearly twenty years since the 
sixth and last volume of Walpole's 
"History of England, 1815 to 
1858," appeared ; and since then, no satisfactory 
work has been produced in continuation of more 
recent English history. Sir Spencer Walpole's re-

pick up the dropped thread where he left it, thus 
ofEering a connected history for the larger part of the 
nineteenth century. His present work, " The His- 
tory of Twenty-five Years " (Longmans, Green, & 
Co.), covers the years from 1856 to 1881, of which 
the two volumes so far issued extend to 1870. As 
is indicated by the title, the author's purpose is not 
to write exclusively of English history, but rather 
of general movements and events, throughout the 
world, in which England had an essential interest 
and part. This was, in fact, a characteristic of the 
earlier work ; and there has been no change in 
the general method of treatment. Indeed, the most 
striking thing about the present work is that Mr. 
Walpole has been able to resume so closely the 
style, spirit, and attitude of twenty years ago. The 
value of his work does not lie in any exhaustive 
research for remote causes, for such research would 
be necessarily futile as yet, but in the ability to 
group vividly the more open and public sources of 
movements, and to treat them with impartiality. 
Mr. Walpole gives all the necessary data for an 
exact general knowledge of his period, yet has the 
art of so combining that data with the expression 
of underlying ideal movements as to maintain a con- 
stant interest. In a word, he is both the popular 
and the reliable historian; and when it is added 
that his voluminous footnote references are pur- 
posely selected with a view to their accessibility by 
ordinary readers and students, it is evident that his 
present labor will meet with a general welcome.

" Essays for the Day (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.), three of which are reprints, and 
three are new. Especially timely in this centen- 
nial year of Hawthorne's birth is his study of " The 
Scarlet Letter," an essay naturally having to do 
chiefly with the ethical and religious import of the 
book. Indeed, all the essays are deeply religious 
in tone, but of a breadth and humanity that will 
make them attractive to a wide range of readers. 
*' A Layman's Reflections on Music," the layman 
being in this instance a clergyman, is profoundly 
suggestive. Not only does Dr. Munger hold with 
Schopenhauer that " the world is embodied music," 
but he also believes music to be " the type and ex- 
pression of the eternal world," and in affirming 
this declares that he is speaking with as much ex- 
actness as if he were dealing with weights and meas- 
ures. The first essay, on " The Church," breathes 
a most liberal spirit, which is further displayed in 
the following chapter on " The Interplay of Chris- 
tianity and Literature"; but after this fine advo- 
cacy of the most enlightened liberality in religion, 
the author surprises us by his word of eulogy for 
that canonized leader of a now outworn ortho- 
doxy, Athanasius. There is just a possibility, too, 
that the essayist gives him more than his due in 
assigning to him the credit of " fixing in the mind 
of the world a phrase of more worth than all litera- 



tures, — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Without 
pausing to discuss this valuation of the dogma of 
the Trinity, one is led to query whether it is pos- 
sible that Dr. Munger is here caught napping and 
is referring to the so-called Athanasian Creed, well 
known for its detailed explanation of the three 
terms in question, but now no longer assigned to 
Athanasius, being, by both external and internal 
evidence, of demonstrably later origin. Probably 
not; yet far worse blunders are not unknown to 

literature. 

standards Anyone who reads Professor Thomas 

of English, R, Lounsbury's " Standards of Pro- 

pronunciaiion. nunciation in English" (Harper) 
with the hope of getting light on some disputed 
points in orthoepy will meet with disappointment. 
He will neither find general principles to guide him 
through the shifting quicksands of English speech, 
nor the author's authority in support of any partic- 
ular pronunciation of doubtful words. Professor 
Lounsbury maintains a strictly impartial attitude 
toward contending pronunciations, recording all 
without giving preference to any. In this book he 
sets himself the task of showing, in the first place, 
that no dictionary can be regarded as the ultimate 
standard of authority ; second, that not even the con- 
current voice of all the lexicographers can be taken 
as conclusive authority, since deviations from the 
established usage may creep in at any time and 
authorize pronunciations that now have no claim to 
acceptance ; and third, that under our present sys- 
tem of orthography, by which we have many differ- 
ent combinations of letters with the same sound, 
uniformity of orthoepy can never be realized. In 
support of these views, the history is given of some 
two hundred and fifty words whose pronunciation 
is either now a matter of dispute oj* which have 
undergone orthoepic changes. The majority of the 
words used as illustrations are in common use, and 
their biography is of interest to the general reader 
as well as to the student of language. Some of the 
most important orthoepic changes now going on in 
the language, such as the varying pronunciation of 
the long u, of the r, and the tendency toward the 
fusion of certain combinations of consonants, are 
not touched upon in this treatise. 

Letters of '^^^ " Letters of Lord Acton to Mary 

a brilliant Gladstone" (Macmillan), edited by 

Englishman. Herbert Paul, cover the period from 

1879 to 1886. They are chiefly interesting for the 
intimate view offered of the intellectual temper of 
Lord Acton himself, though many brilliant and 
familiar characterizations of men prominent in 
political and literary circles add vivacity to the 
correspondence. Mary Gladstone's letters are not 
given, and in consequence some allusions, possibly 
quite plain to the editor, who has taken his duties 
very lightly, are wholly blind to the reader. Lord 
Acton was unquestionably one of the most learned 
men of his time, — so learned, in fact, that he 
shrank from attempting any really important work,

not because be dreaded tbe labor itself, but because 
his view was so comprehensive that he was never 
satisfied with the materials at hand. In politics 
he was a consistent adherent of Gladstone, esti- 
mating his leader as one of the great men of history, 
yet critical of details. His letters (which Gladstone 
himself did not read, save where they involved some 
direct criticism) are full of advice to Mary Glad- 
stone about the petty social amenities by means of 
which her father's political course may be rendered 
more smooth, and of suggestions as to how this or 
that individual should be treated. Comparatively 
little is to be found in these letters bearing upon 
Lord Acton as an historical student or as a religious 
controversialist. They are rather the letters of a 
brilliant independent thinker, chatting on events 
of present-day political importance, and descriptive 
of men of contemporaneous interest.

an American have been utilized by that indefati- 

s«a-captain. gable inquirer into matters of naval 

history, Mr. E. S. Maclay, to make up a sketch of 
a hitherto unknown hero, Captain Moses Brown. 
Newburyport, cradle of sea-dogs, produced this 
doughty captain, who sailed the seas in merchant- 
man, sloop, and man-of-war, for over half a cen- 
tury, finding at last a winding sheet and sailor's 
burial within sight of his native shore. His adven- 
tures rival those of a romance. He was almost 
buried alive at sea, was cast away in a small boat 
for a week, boldly took an American vessel into 
London in 1776, was afterward captured by the 
British, chased innumerable suspicious craft on the 
seas, and captured many vessels of the enemy. Mr. 
Maclay has made most of the scanty materials at 
his command, and throws no little light on many 
details connected with the naval history of the 
United States through this humble agent. The log 
of the "Merrimac," commanded by Captain Brown, 
affords a glimpse of the extensive reprisals against 
the French that were carried on in 1798, and the 
close alliance between British and American vessels 
under the Jay treaty. Several sketch maps serve to 
locate the places in question, and a number of au- 
thentic illustrations add both pleasure and instruc- 
tion. While few may be prepared to share the 
author's enthusiasm over the Yankee captain as a 
hero, all will enjoy reading of the old sailor's ex- 
ploits. A date or two is incorrectly stated, but the 
context easily rectifies the error. (Baker & Taylor

Oriental scholars were startled in 
1902 by the discovery at old Susa 
of a strange monument of antiquity 
— an obelisk of black diorite, on which was in- 
scribed, in archaic Babylonian characters, a long 
ancient document. This was copied and published 
by Professor Scheil of the University of Paris in 
October, 1902. It proved to be a code of laws of 
Hammurabi, king of the first Babylonian dynasty, 
about 2250 B. C. This monument preserved in-

tact 248 laws, civil in character, which were in 
vogue in Babylonia in Abraham's day. Professor 
Robert Francis Harper, with the cooperation and 
assistance of his students and colleagues at the 
University of Chicago, has now issued " The Code 
of Hammurabi" (University of Chicago Press), 
embracing a facsimile of the original text, a trans- 
literation, a translation into English, an index of 
the laws, a glossary of the original words, and a 
sign-list of the original writing. The volume is a 
valuable addition to our literature of the ancient 
Orient. Its value is readily apparent when we con- 
sider that we have here a code of laws antedating 
the time of Moses by almost a thousand years. 
This priority, in time, of many laws similar to 
those of the Jewish lawgiver, points to a high state 
of civilized society in Babylonia before Abraham 
left Ur of the Chaldees. It shows, furthermore, 
that there must have been court decisions centuries 
before such a codification as this could have been 
made. Their provisions are so full as almost to stag- 
ger our belief at the complications of the society of 
the twenty-third century B. C. The similarity of 
many of these laws to those of the Pentateuch has 
given rise to a multitude of questions regarding the 
origin of the so-called Mosaic laws, and requires 
also a recasting of our interpretation of the language 
of the books of Moses. Apart from the great 
interest of the laws on their own account, there is 
material here for years of study, touching ancient 
history, civilization, and the Old Testament. 

Mr. Gilbert Holland Montague's 
work on " Trusts of To-day " (Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co.) is of two-fold 
value. To the student of economics, it will recom- 
mend itself as a concise and scientific treatment of 
the trust problem in its most recent developments ; 
while to the more superficial surveyor of the subject 
it will appear an easy means of learning something 
of the nature of trusts, their history and their posi- 
tion in the modern industrial world. Mr. Montague 
begins by tracing the development of industrial 
combination, and proceeds to discuss its various 
aspects. He lays some stress on the savings of 
combination in the marketing of the product, as 
distinguished from the savings in the production of 
output resulting from concentrated capital. After 
pointing out the evils in modern trust organiza- 
tions, he turns to the question of trust-regulation, 
and traces the various statutory remedies, from the 
Inter-state Commerce Act of 1887 through the 
Nelson Amendment of 1903. Although the reforms 
suggested within the last few years by Attorney- 
General Knox and the Industrial Commission are 
carefully elaborated, yet the reader is left unas- 
sured of Mr. Montague's bare position on the sub- 
ject. While this result may be disappointing, it is 
in accordance with the author's plan of writing the 
book, which was to present the facts as clearly and 
concisely as possible, leaving the reader to draw his 
own conclusions.

ChTonicUsofan Not many churches enjoy the dis- 
oid New England tinction of being in two towns at 
church parish. ^nce, 80 that a man and his wife, 
worshipping in the same pew on a Sunday, may be 
sitting the husband in one town and his faithful 
helpmate in another. Yet this is exactly the situa- 
tion of the old Byfield Congregational Church in 
Essex County, Massachusetts. The parish com- 
prises parts of Newbury, Rawley, and Georgetown, 
and dates from 1702. Its bicentennial celebration, 
as some readers may remember, was held two sum- 
mers ago, when Dr. E. E. Hale addressed a large au- 
dience both of residents and of " old home week " 
visitors, taking for his theme the historical associa- 
tions of the county ; and Professor John Louis 
Ewell, D.D., of Howard University, and an old 
Byfielder, gave the local historical address. These 
discourses, with much other matter. Dr. Ewell has 
now published in handsome form, with numerous 
portraits, views, maps and plans, the whole entitled 
" The Story of Byfield " (George E. Littlefield, 
Boston). In its ancestry, as also in its progeny, 
the parish has reason to take pride ; and Dr. Swell's 
scholarly and attractive volume deserves a cordial 
welcome at the hands of all her sons and daughters, 
and of all interested in local New England history. 
It is curious to note how many of our " first fami- 
lies " are in some way, more or less directly, con- 
nected with this little Puritan parish of Byfield.

member of Parliament, headed a plan for the bet- 
terment of persons imprisoned for debt. They 
were to be transported free to America, to found 
a colony '■*■ in the same parallel as Palestine, and 
pointed out by God's own choice." The world- 
scale of the proposition attracted unusual attention. 
As Pope said, 

" One driven by strong benevolence of soul 
Shall fly like Oglethorpe from pole to pole." 

Unlike many similar projects, this one was car- 
ried out, entirely through Oglethorpe's persistence. 
Debtors, paupers, Salzburgers, — the poor and op- 
^pressed of many lands, — made up the first settlers 
in Georgia. Miss Harriet C Cooper has added a 
life of this reformer, warrior, and statesman, to 
the "Historic Lives" series (Appleton). It re- 
lates briefly the birth of the philanthropic scheme, 
the planting of the colony, the movements of Ogle- 
thorpe during the twelve years that he spent partly 
in America, and the wars with the Spanish, which 
occupied most of his time on this side the water. 
Whitefield plays an important part in the narrative. 
There is little attempt at eulogy, but the reader 
feels that the difBiculties that beset the infant colony, 
with the reasons for its failure as a philanthropic 
experiment, might have been dwelt on at greater 
length without detracting from the courage and 
persistence of Oglethorpe. Here is where his quali- 
ties as a leader were shown to greatest advantage.

its sober but hopeful outlook upon industrial rela- 
tionship. Mr. Oilman's object in writing the book, 
as he states, is to consider methods of establishing 
industrial peace, and, more specifically, the problem 
of preventing strikes and lockouts. He discusses 
the various means available for the adjustment of 
disputes, — collective bargaining, the sliding scale, 
conciliation, and arbitration. He advocates allowing 
labor and capital to settle their own differences ; 
yet at the same time he recognizes the public as the 
final arbiter between them. His chapters on the 
incorporation of industrial unions (a term he uses 
to include trusts and labor-unions), and on the legal 
regulation of labor disputes in New Zealand, are 
interesting and suggestive. It is through the en- 
lightenment of all classes of society, and especially 
trades-unionists, as to the conditions actually pre- 
vailing, that there is hope of industrial peace.

tions of the olden days in the different counties of 
England. A book by Mr. G. L. Apperson on " By- 
gone London Life " ( Pott) is a wholly independent 
publication, although it pursues a similar vein of 
research. It purports to present " Pictures from a 
vanished past," of life in the great English metrop- 
olis during the seventeenth and eighteenth centu- 
ries, when restaurants and coffee-houses were so 
intimately connected with the life of the people as 
to be incorporated in the literature of the time ; 
when the " swells " outswelled the dandies of every 
other period; when a love for the extraordinary 
fostered the equipment of small private enterprises 
intended to serve as " museums "; and when the 
bellmen, the watermen (for the Thames was then 
a great highway), the linkmen, and the charmen 
were conspicuous and highly characteristic figures of 
the London streets. The book is by no means ex- 
haustive of those things which differentiated the 
London life that then was from that which now is ; 
but it helps us to understand more fully the books 
written two centuries ago which we still read.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



biography of Michelangelo, as newly translated by Mr. 
Herbert P. Home. In this work the " Montallegro " 
type, designed by Mr. Home for the Merrymount Press, 
will be used for the first time. 

" The Better New York," by Dr. William H. Tolman 
and Mr. Charles Hemstreet, is a sort of guide-book to 
the city, placing its main stress upon the various relig- 
ious, educational, and charitable agencies. The work 
is planned in eleven sections, thus making it a very 
practical aid to the investigations of the sociological 
student. It is published by the Baker & Taylor Co. 

Mr. John T. McCutcheon's «' Bird Center Cartoons " 
have cheered and enlivened the readers of the Chicago 
" Tribune " for many months past. They have recently 
been collected into a volume, supplied with a running 
commentary, and published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co. Mr. McCutcheon's text is quite as droll as his 
drawings, and the volume that contains them both is a 
source of unmixed delight. 

An interesting announcement comes to us from the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. of a series in preparation by that 
house devoted to " French Men of Letters," planned on 
much the same lines as Mr. Morley's great undertaking. 
Mr. Alexander Jessup is named as general editor of the 
enterprise, and in the first two volumes to appear M. 
Ferdinand Brunetifere will deal with Balzac and Profes- 
sor Edward Dowden with Montaigne. 

" A Manual of Pronunciation," by Mr. Otis Asbmore, 
is a useful little book published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
It gives in parallel columns a selection of words diversely 
pronounced, and with each word gives the pronunciation 
preferred by a number of standard dictionaries. Four 
American and six English authorities are thus referred 
to, making it possible to see at a glance what pronun- 
ciation of any particular word is favored by the weight 
of opinion. 

A volume upon the " Elementary Principles of Eco- 
nomics," to which is joined a short sketch of economic 
history, is published through the Macmillan Co. as 
a text for school use. It is the work of Professors 
Richard T. Ely and George Ray Wicker, and presents in 
lucid form the principles of economic science as viewed 
by the most modern students of the subject. The book 
is well-appointed for educational purposes, and may be 
recommended for school use. 

The introduction by Dr. James K. Hosmer to Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co.'s forthcoming reprint of the Jour- 
nal of Sergeant Patrick Gass will be devoted to an ac- 
count of " The Rank and File of the Lewis and Clark 
Expedition," in which Dr. Hosmer presents whatever 
details are known regarding not only the doughty Gass, 
but all the other men comprising the expedition. It is 
fitting that this should be done, as so much has been 
written of the Captains that the humbler figures of the 
others who by their devotion and bravery made the 
great journey a success have been somewhat obscured. 

" The Statesman's Year-Book " grows a little stouter, 
and, if possible, a little more useful every year. The 
volume now before us is the forty- first annual publica- 
tion of the work , and is edited by Dr. J. Scott Keltic^ 
with the assistance of Mr. I, P. A. Renwick. Its 
special feature is a series of statistical tables and dia- 
grams illustrating the development of British trade 
from 1860 to 1904. The maps, also, bear largely upon 
this subject. The volume contains nearly fourteen hun- 
dred pages, and is published, as heretofore, by the 
Macmillan Co. 



Wilhelm Ltibke's " Outlines of the History of Art," 
for many years one of the most popular, useful, and 
authoritative works accessible to the public, has been 
taken in hand by Mr. Russell Sturgis, who has minutely 
revised it throughout, making of it a strictly new edi- 
tion and something more. As the editor truly says, 
"the history of art which is possible to-day was un- 
thinkable in 1860" — the date when Lubke's "Grun- 
driss" first appeared. In its present form the work 
consists of two very large volumes, and has many hun- 
dreds of illustrations. It is published by Messrs. Dodd^ 
Mead & Co. 

One of th« most meritorious of the popular art series 
now issuing is " Newnes's Art Library," published in this 
country by Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co. Volumes 
on Botticelli, Velasquez, and Reynolds have already 
made their appearance, and others are in active prepara- 
tion. The text occupies but a few pages in each case, 
comprising a succinct sketch of the artist and a list of 
his principal works. The illustrations have foremost 
place in the plan, and are numerous enough to represent 
even the most prolific of painters with some degree of 
adequacy. In reproduction and printing, the plates are 
uncommonly good examples of half-tone work; and in 
addition each volume has a frontispiece in photogravure. 
A work of unusual value and timeliness in view of the 
current discussion of American marriage and divorce 
problems will be published at once by the University 
of Chicago Press, in the "History of Matrimonial 
Institutions," by Professor George E. Howard, for ten 
years head of the Department of History in Leland 
Stanford Jr. University. This three-volume work pre- 
sents a complete historical survey of the development 
of the family as an institution and of the matrimonial 
practices that obtained in the various and typical 
stages of its growth, analyzing primitive customs and 
carefully tracing the evolution of the modern insti- 
tution. The history of marriage and divorce in the 
United States constitutes a separate part, and is the 
most complete presentation of the subject now avail- 
able. All the laws enacted in all the states since the 
Revolution have been examined, and the essentials em- 
bodied in an interesting narrative. The whole is sup- 
plemented by the most complete bibliography of the 
subject ever compiled, together with an index of the 
cases cited and a subject index. 

It is announced that a reorganization has taken place 
in the well-known house of D. Appleton & Company, 
Mr. Joseph H. Sears being appointed President of the 
corporation, to succeed Mr. William W. Appleton, wha 
resigns the position to become Chairman of the Board 
of Directors. Messrs. Charles A. and Edward D. 
Appleton retire from the board, and are succeeded by 
Mr. Sears and Mr. George S. Emory, the latter being 
also made a Vice-President. The reasons given for these 
changes are that in view of the increasing responsibili- 
ties of Messrs. Edward D. and Charles A. Appleton 
as managers, respectively, of the Chicago and Boston 
offices of the corporation, they find difficulty in attend- 
ing Board meetings in New York, and voluntarily resign 
to make room for men on the ground. In assuming the 
Chairmanship of the Board of Directors, Mr, William W. 
Appleton will be so occupied with the work entailed by 
that position that he cannot attend to the duties of the 
Presidency as well. The house of Appleton has had 
one of the oldest and most honorable careers of any in 
the American trade, and the best wishes of all will fol- 
low it tinder its new management.

VACATION TRAVEL 


DOOK publishers and book journals are 
'— ' alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book jom-nals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous journals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. All 
the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book cla.ss, — the literary and culti- 
vated class.

'T*HE DIAL is more generally consulted 
* and depended upon by Librarians in 
making up ordeics for books than any 
other American critical journal; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other journal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.
